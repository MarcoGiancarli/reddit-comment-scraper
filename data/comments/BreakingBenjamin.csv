BreakingBenjamin,3dmrc6,tenyard,12,Fri Jul 17 15:11:38 2015 UTC,"I disagree, but I don't see why it matters either way. I'm Catholic and all I listen to is real rock and metal (i.e. not self-labeled god rock). There's no shortage of sexual, atheist, and satanist themes in the music I listen to and it has never once bothered me. I'm a firm believer that someone can only be offended if they're looking for something to bother them.  Also, I will throw this out there. To me, when I listen to symphonic or viking metal for example, I hear about what I believe is a fairy tale (Odin, valhalla, etc.) and don't pretend like I'm being preached to. I assume this is what Christianity is to you so there's no reason you should care."
BreakingBenjamin,3dmrc6,Studio1417,3,Fri Jul 17 17:58:28 2015 UTC,Very well put. Too many people these days are looking for something to be offended by instead of learning to think objectively and see a situation from another person's point of view.
BreakingBenjamin,3dmrc6,_Wolverine007_,7,Sat Jul 18 00:52:02 2015 UTC,"There are religious references, he talked about that in an interview. Second, it doesn't really change much. There have been religious references in almost every album... And here's why I think he mentions those. New guitarist is Jasen Rauch, ex-guitarist for Christian band Red (which is an amazing band imo). Album is still good, the references almost don't do anything for it, since 'God' can be perceived as someone who means a lot to you, like a lover. There's more than one way to look at everything."

BreakingBenjamin,3dmrc6,wingzfan99,3,Fri Jul 17 16:26:19 2015 UTC,"""Art isn't an answer, it's a question mark.""   The songs can be interpreted into whatever you decide they mean. They're words set to music. Ben may have written them with one idea in mind, but you as the listener can use the same words and sounds and take a totally different view on it. Thad the beauty of art and expression. There is never one way to look at it."
BreakingBenjamin,3dmrc6,TubbytheIDD,4,Fri Jul 17 20:36:11 2015 UTC,"Starting from Saturate every album has had something on it that one could read into as ""churchy."" Idk why you have to let it bother you if you like the band."
BreakingBenjamin,3dmrc6,tarantula_eater,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:10:09 2015 UTC,"Basically this entire album. But it's sort of something that happens. Ben is the singer/songwriter, who basically wrote the album alone before he even had a band, so the album is entirely him and his personal experience, if he is religious or questioning if he should be, then that would probably become really clear in his writing. Which it sort of did this album.  It's also not being preached to. You could definitely find other meanings if you wanted to, or if you felt something else while listening. (Which you seem to have since you said you can still get into the album)   I really don't think they'll get much less secular than this. Ashes of Eden is probably one of the most religious songs they will ever write."
BreakingBenjamin,3dmrc6,Thisisalsomypass,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:22:19 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, I believe it just depends on how you interpret the songs. The first time I listened to Ashes of Eden I thought it sounded religious, but now I think of it as someone so supportive and loving who was suddenly lost or just disappeared.   ""I am not worthy of this,"" -not worthy of the care and support from said person?   ""Are you with me after all? Why can't I hear you?"" -grieving over their loss or disappearance?  ""stay with me, don't let me go, until the Ashes of Eden fall"" -wanting their support until the bad times are over?   ""Ashes of Eden"" -(I can see how it could get churchy here, flames are usually Devil territory and now apparently the Garden of God is up in flames), or how you were once up in the clouds where everything was okay, and now the ""ashes"" of it all are crumbling  down around you because said person is gone?   I think all the ""darkness"" and ""heaven above me"" is depression and desperately wanting said person and their support back. However, I see ""shine until there's nothing left but you"" as kind of a ""you can do this on your own"" kind of thing too.   I can still definitely see this as a religious song, but everything above is how I interpret it."
BreakingBenjamin,3dmrc6,hollow-heroes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:32:52 2015 UTC,"I agree. A lot of the songs have overt Christian (or at least religious) lyrics (Ashes of Eden, Great Divide, Close to Heaven, etc.) and a few that have softer references (Failure, Defeated, Angels Fall). But honestly, you should learn to respect other people's beliefs. Plus Ben has always kept his lyrics cryptic enough so that they can be interpreted a different way. As Studio1417 pointed out, there's a ton of songs with references to Satanism, Paganism, etc., and I'm sure you wouldn't be nearly as bothered by that. It's always Christianity whenever people call a band out. It can even go so far as overt references to sex, drugs, alcohol, etc., but if anyone ever mentions the word ""God"" they're attacked."
BreakingBenjamin,3dmrc6,jacedc98,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:23:52 2015 UTC,"As has already been said here, there have been religious references in every Breaking Benjamin album. I think they probably became more of a staple on Dear Agony because the album was so much about Ben battling his proverbial demons, what with his illness and recovering alcoholism. I imagine the same can be said for Dark Before Dawn, and there are more references than on, say, We Are Not Alone, because he's still dealing with those demons, but from a different perspective (I'd say the major difference in mood between those two albums is that Dear Agony was Ben looking at all of the hardships he was going through at the beginning, when he was daunted by the prospect, whereas Dark Before Dawn comes from a place of acceptance and resilience).  I recall an interview with Ben and Chad from the Dear Agony era where Chad spoke about his Christianity, and Ben confessed that he's either a relaxed Christian or an agnostic. I can't for the life of me find the interview, though, but I'll share the link if I do. So if you feel like there are super Christian/religious references, then it's probably because they reflect Ben's actual beliefs, and his beliefs come out when he writes (just like with lots of writers).   In the end, even if Breaking Benjamin did end up evolving into a more faith-based band, they wouldn't be turning away from their fanbase. People would be turning away from them."
BreakingBenjamin,3dmrc6,iamkazlan,0,Tue Jul 21 07:59:50 2015 UTC,"Ben repeatedly states that he doesn't want to tell fans what his songs are about; he wants to hear it from them. The fantastic thing about his music is its applicability - one single song can have so many different associations for different people. To me Dear Agony and Dark Before Dawn are absolutely dripping with Christian ideas and references, and now I come here and see that some disagree or only see it when they're told about it. That's a great feature of many both musical and literary works - you don't have to hold any certain beliefs to enjoy them, but if you do you may get other things out of them than if you don't. Other examples include the Star Wars films - very strong Christian symbolism, but you don't need to see that to enjoy them. (Came to think of them now because Ben has said Ep 4-6 are his favourite films of all time.)"
BreakingBenjamin,3dmrc6,ToffeeKing,0,Fri Jul 17 20:26:31 2015 UTC,"i think so. i  also noticed that he has not cursed in the past two albums for what its worth. its also about his religious struggles though, he isnt exactly all about Christianity"

BreakingBenjamin,3dmrc6,Phobiass,-6,Sat Jul 18 06:22:42 2015 UTC,I'm not feeling anything even close to what you are describing. Though I would be very upset if Ben started writing more songs about a creepy cult.
BreakingBenjamin,3dmrc6,Arluza,-5,Fri Jul 17 15:25:12 2015 UTC,"I was really getting into Ashes of Eden, but after listening to it for a few times it came off as super churchy -   ""Will the faithful be rewarded, when we come to the end.""  ""Are you with me after all, why can't I hear you?""  ""Are you with me through it all, then why can't I feel you?""  ""Heaven above me, take my hand, shine until there's nothing left but you""  Just my interpretation I guess. I'm with you, I don't want to hear songs about an invisible space dude watching my every move."
BreakingBenjamin,3dmrc6,Arluza,5,Fri Jul 17 15:32:12 2015 UTC,Almost sounds like an anti religion song since he's openly asking why there is not evidence towards a deity
BreakingBenjamin,3dmrc6,ToffeeKing,2,Fri Jul 17 15:36:30 2015 UTC,"Anti-religious is the last thing I would call this song.

BreakingBenjamin,3dki7g,RedStag86,3,Fri Jul 17 02:02:30 2015 UTC,I didn't like it that much the first few times I listened to it. It has grown on me a bit. I wouldn't put it above Phobia or We Are Not Alone though.
BreakingBenjamin,3dki7g,Captain_Scoobysnack,3,Fri Jul 17 02:19:11 2015 UTC,"Bro. It's a 5 piece band now (never been this way before) this is the first album where Ben did not have to do all the backing vocals. He did not have to record the majority himself, and he is actually for once quite vocal about the guys in the band, he fucking loves where he is now and the next album (all health permitting) will show this, I truly believe. I mean, he's FINALLY talking about heading over seas on a ship. Before the new lineup it was always assumed that Breaking Benjamin would never travel.   I look at this album as a teaser for the next because the next album will actually be a Breaking Benjamin album and not just a Ben Burnley album. But that's not saying I dislike Dark before Dawn, angels fall is probably one of my all time favorite songs from Ben."
BreakingBenjamin,3dki7g,GeorgedaflashGlass,3,Fri Jul 17 11:56:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know man I agree with you. I like couldn't feel the connection with the lyrics. I feel like he's pulling from a hat full of dark phrases. ""Something something fall down"" ""..something something pain.."" ""..something can't go on"" ""leave behind"" etc. And I just don't see it. Honestly for most of their recent stuff I can't even fucking  tell what the songs about, it's just catchy."
BreakingBenjamin,3dki7g,nickyty123,2,Fri Jul 17 12:17:29 2015 UTC,"I thought the exact same thing, like damn I remember So Cold was a brilliant song with well written lyrics but this Dark Before Dawn album is so predictable and generic."
BreakingBenjamin,3dki7g,TheGrimoire,2,Fri Jul 17 23:18:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah I wish he had more varied songs instead of the typical ""angel of dark light leave me behind feeling so lost blah blah empty inside blah all alone""."
BreakingBenjamin,3dki7g,Studio1417,3,Sat Jul 18 19:06:55 2015 UTC,"It's still leagues ahead of Dear Agony, but I would agree that it's not as great now that the dust has settled. Saturate and Phobia certainly put DBD to shame, but that's okay. I would never expect any album to compare to those. This is a new Breaking Benjamin and a new era of music from when those were made."
BreakingBenjamin,3dki7g,deogot2b,3,Fri Jul 17 18:01:11 2015 UTC,"It feels very generic to me, the only song that particularly stands out to me is Breaking the Silence."
BreakingBenjamin,3dki7g,iamkazlan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:12:51 2015 UTC,"Breaking the Silence gives me a really WANA feel, which is terrific, and probably why it's such a star on the album, considering WANA is probably the best BB album."
BreakingBenjamin,3dki7g,deogot2b,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:00:53 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, that is definitely my favourite BB album."
BreakingBenjamin,3dki7g,CraziBoi94,3,Tue Jul 21 13:52:13 2015 UTC,"I agree. This album just isn't hitting me as much as the previous ones. Ive been listening since release & dont mind it, but im not feeling it that much. Most of it just sounds like recycled stuff he put together & done. Not bad, but meh. He gave me 4 solid albums though, not too many musicians can do that for me."
BreakingBenjamin,3dki7g,Phobiass,3,Sat Jul 18 06:34:20 2015 UTC,"To me, this album has a bit from everything they've ever done. Failure sounds like phobia and we are not alone together, breaking the silence sounds like saturate and dear agony together. And I love the breaking Ben blue balls you get on close to heaven where they normally have a big moment in the first chorus, and it just drops into a quiet, laid back piece. Ashes of Eden shows a lot of emotion and care, and letting him break free from what he normally does. Each song might repeat some lyrics here or there, but they all use them to tell completely different stories. We Are Not Alone will probably always be my favorite, but this is a close second."
BreakingBenjamin,3dki7g,Phobiass,-5,Fri Jul 17 01:55:45 2015 UTC,"""Ashes of Eden shows a lot of emotion and care, and letting him break free from what he normally does.""  God, I dunno, that song was the nail in the coffin for me. The first time I heard that song it sounded like his balls fell off. And I like his softer songs like his acoustic version of So Cold and The Diary of Jane and his cover of Who Wants to Live Forver. Those are all great soft songs with emotion and power.   But here it sounds too girly."
BreakingBenjamin,3dki7g,Phobiass,2,Fri Jul 17 02:15:30 2015 UTC,"Just because he left his voice stay clean and kept it mellow, while hitting notes higher than he normally does doesn't make it ""girly""? When you open yourself up to the world like that if anything it shows you have more balls than most."
BreakingBenjamin,3dki7g,hollow-heroes,-2,Fri Jul 17 06:16:01 2015 UTC,"Again, I like his softer songs. The acoustic version of Give Me A Sign is a great example of a gentle, mellow song of his. Just this new one sounded kinda like a girly pop song to me.   And if anything Give Me a Sign has more personal and emotionally deep lyrics and notes than any of this new generic stuff."
BreakingBenjamin,3dki7g,bigwhiskey91,3,Fri Jul 17 06:23:23 2015 UTC,"""Girly pop song"" should never be used to describe a song just because it's softer than you like/ are accustomed too. It's clearly not pop because people are actually playing instruments. It's not ""girly"" because there's no ""girly"" meaning anywhere in the song? He's pouring his heart out. That's it. He leaves songs vague so you can have your own interpretation."
BreakingBenjamin,3dki7g,echojester,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:27:56 2015 UTC,"No one can sway your opinion if you just flat out don't have a connection to the songs. Dark Before Dawn is the first album they've had in 6 years, and it's a new crew besides Ben.  People change a lot in 6 years, Ben included.   I think this album is a bit churchy, but after listening to it over and over I can hear the lyrics so they have a different meaning for me. It took me ages to warm up to Saturate, and there's still a few songs on there I just don't listen to.   It's all you, man. Someone could tell me for hours how much they love olives and I'll still refuse to eat them."

I'm going in the middle of August, the end of August, and the middle of September, but I'm assuming that they're going to do pretty much the same set for all three.

BreakingBenjamin,3c4l8p,rhcp88,3,Sat Jul 4 19:01:01 2015 UTC,Get a nice piece of glass to sit on top and you will have the best little table in the world.
BreakingBenjamin,3c4l8p,GeorgedaflashGlass,3,Sat Jul 4 23:20:02 2015 UTC,"I did consider that, but not sure if it would maybe obscure the design on the top?  And as for the shape - ideally the glass would be cut to match the outline of the BB logo but I'm guessing that would cost a pretty penny. Maybe a circular piece would be the next best option?"
BreakingBenjamin,3c4l8p,GeorgedaflashGlass,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:39:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think if you ended up custom cutting the glass it'd be a waste of money and defeat the purpose of the glass. I'd definitely go with a proportionate circular piece if anything.   Or leave it, my opinion doesn't matter, you have a great table just as it is."
BreakingBenjamin,3c4l8p,lancerevo98,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:48:34 2015 UTC,i think something more pointy would work. I have a table in my home with a nice hexagonal shaped glass on top and I think that might work pretty well here.
BreakingBenjamin,3c4l8p,craigmej,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:11:05 2015 UTC,"Following the outline like that would be difficult, glass does not like being cut into weird shapes.

The only thing is at that point, Failure wasn't released so I would imagine that made the cut this time around. They tend to do a lot of covers when they acoustic too.

I went to the show last night in Athens GA. You are pretty much dead on. They did a few more from their first album than they would typically do as Ben said. (Skin, Shallow Bay, Polyamorous, and maybe one other... Next to Nothing maybe) They did however, do Failure last night which was awesome. There was also their Queen cover, Alice in Chains - Would cover,  Tool - AEnama cover. They also did Unknown Soldier, Dance with the Devil and Evil Angel.   I could probably name everything they did if I really tried. It seriously was a blur. Amazing Show."
BreakingBenjamin,3c43cb,kenobi112,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:10:35 2015 UTC,Wait he played Skin? Does he not hate that song anymore?

BreakingBenjamin,3c43cb,kenobi112,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:59:04 2015 UTC,Ahh fair enough. I thought it was a little odd I haven't seen him play skin since the saturate days and even then he barely sung it.

BreakingBenjamin,3c43cb,veloxthekrakenslayer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:16:14 2015 UTC,There was a disagreement with Hollywood Records where the band wanted Medicare as the single for Saturate but Hollywood Records made it so it had to be skin which annoyed Ben. He appears to not play it live in spite of them. That's all I know about it. There may be other reasons why he hates it but I haven't heard of any.

Maybe the thicker interior is enough to consider it a ""different"" logo?  Edit: phrasing.  Edit Edit: I visited the website for Ian Blowers, apparently they have been in existence since 1970 and based in the UK. Maybe that has something to do with it."
BreakingBenjamin,3c08bg,echojester,8,Fri Jul 3 19:55:50 2015 UTC,"Well,  the bands logo is a Celtic knot styled around the letter B. It's not totally unique enough for sueing grounds."
BreakingBenjamin,3c08bg,fartlekbritches,2,Fri Jul 3 22:36:41 2015 UTC,"This. Besides, I don't think BB would have trademarked the rounded version of the logo. The pointed version, perhaps, but then again, the thicker inside lines is probably enough to make it a 'technically' different knot."

BreakingBenjamin,3bpfli,ivantowerz,2,Wed Jul 1 19:38:01 2015 UTC,Might be because they don't have breaking Benjamin's new album on the site. I'm not sure I don't actually know what the billboard 200 is or why its relevant. I assume it's a list of the top songs at the moment across all genres but then the title says #1 album which could be a different chart?  EDIT: Apparently billboards update on July 4th.

BreakingBenjamin,3bpfli,_Wolverine007_,4,Fri Jul 3 00:16:41 2015 UTC,"I kinda understand the use of the term ""mainstream rock"" but to give the ""hipster bullshit"" the title of ""rock"" seems a little off.

All well it's not that important what the billboards say anyway. As long as BB's #1 nothing else matters."

BreakingBenjamin,3benmc,bb74682047247,4,Sun Jun 28 23:39:05 2015 UTC,"It happens to alot of albums these days, take as a example the new hollywood undead record ( their previous albums had solid sale numbers). Their 3rd record opened up at number 2 on the billboard 200, their 4th record has opened at 18th. Their has been absolutely no hype for that album and i think alot of people don't even know they have another.  it happens alot lately that albums have little to no hype. Not many music videos get released so you won't find out about a band on tv, a single gets released on youtube on either a VEVO channel , An own channel or a channel of their record label, that is just too confusing. And some bands just don't get that much time on the radio. But remember BB is not as big as it used to be, there was a 5/6 year space of time between Dear Agony and Dark Before Dawn. BB must (as stupid as it sounds) start from scratch, just like any other band has too. You can compare this to a debut album, those don't get much hype but with each record there will be more.

She started a fight with him but that guy got blamed for it and called out. She wasn't the only one though, another chick right by me got escorted out because she pushed and clawed her way to the front and was drunk. We all called her out saying you can just pull your way to the front when other people have been there for hours she got mouthy and they pulled her out of the concert with her boyfriend.

I missed hearing Ben's voice pop up randomly on my radio.  I can always play my copies or watch the videos on youtube, but sometimes it's nice to get blindsided by a Breaking Benjamin song and just let it carry you away.  Happened to me not long after this song was released.  Made my whole week."

BreakingBenjamin,3bbmxr,mf4488,4,Sat Jun 27 21:59:57 2015 UTC,"All five of them were really friendly and grateful for the turnout.  I complimented Shaun's drumming, he was especially friendly. Didn't say anything to Aaron though I wish I did, but the line was moving. I told Jason I loved his stuff in Red and that I was happy that he's part of BB, he too thanked me and was especially friendly. Didn't say much to Keith, but as soon as I came up to Ben I told him I had a present and he played along. He didn't know how to respond to my blanket initially but eventually got the joke and went along with it. Keith seemed most amused by the gift. Theyre genuinely great guys.  Edit: Afterwards I met someone who knew the band personally and he put me on the phone with Aaron Fink who's been playing solo shows since Stardog Champion. He seemed super chill. I was watching what I said about BB, but he knew what was up. ""Fan of my previous band huh?"""

BreakingBenjamin,3bb43f,HailWolf,3,Sat Jul 4 05:51:54 2015 UTC,"Nothing.  Two theories though.  Either the guy was mistaken...which would be odd because he was rather specific with the name; or he was reviewing an import.  I remember reading a LONG time ago about Japanese imports.  They pay more for music, thus bands usually release a Japanese version of an album with an extra song or two.  I remember that the song for WANA was Ordinary Man.  The extras for Dear Agony were acoustic version of I Will Not Bow and Without You.  So I guess we can keep an eye out for a Japanese import as that would be very telling."
BreakingBenjamin,3bb43f,vhawk12,2,Mon Jul 6 00:51:01 2015 UTC,Lady Bug was originally a Japanese B side as well. I had to search forever for that shit long before Shallow Bay came out.

I have to think that maybe it was a typo? Maybe he meant ""Defeated"" based on the description of the vocals? I could also see it being ""Close to Heaven"" not only do the titles have the ""to"" in the middle but it's very ""circusy"" in terms of how the verse comes off like it's putting you in a trance.   Or maybe there really is a secret track."

BreakingBenjamin,3bb43f,Trip0lar,4,Thu Jul 16 04:03:27 2015 UTC,"As much as I love this album, how can that guy say that their music style is a step forward from the last album when I can clearly hear reused BB riffs or ones that are very very very similar throughout the whole album. Don't get me wrong, I like it, but obviously he isn't listening close enough."
BreakingBenjamin,3bb43f,Sha11owBay,3,Sat Jun 27 23:19:46 2015 UTC,"Because he's right about Dear Agony ""phoning it in"". Dark Before Dawn has some reused riffs, and plenty of generic moments, but there are plenty of really genuine moments, and the album is more varied songwise. Dear Agony has plenty of powerful moments, but the songs are all too similar to one another, and more throwaway generic tracks (I would say that the most generic tracks on DBD are Failure and Never Again, whereas on DA there's Fade Away, What Lies Beneath, I Will Not Bow, Give Me a Sign...).  Of course, this is all only my opinion, but I definitely agree that DBD is a step up/forward from DA, if only because they took more risks. In reality, Ben didn't really take any musical risks on this album, but he certainly produced a more interesting album than DA."
BreakingBenjamin,3bb43f,iamkazlan,2,Sun Jun 28 01:56:09 2015 UTC,"I can't stand listening to much of Dear Agony. The mixing in that was too loud, to the point you could not hear anything happening in the songs.  The mixing in Dark Before Dawn is significantly better."

BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,baconbash,5,Tue Jun 23 14:24:30 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be honest here: I'm not a ""long time BB fan"" or ""fan since Saturate"" like everyone else here seems to be. I've liked their radio songs for a few years (Diary of Jane, Blow Me Away, Dear Agony, ect.), but never really cared a lot for them.  I saw an ad for the new album on Spotify, and figured I'd give it a listen, I was bored. I has seriously low expectations; I don't listen to a lot of ""screamy"" hard rock/metal and didn't really like Failure (I thought it sounded really similar to Diary of Jane), but the album was fucking great. I'm still listening to it now. Breaking the Silence was a bit iffy at first (like I said, not usually into the growly screaming), but I find myself singing it along with Ben now. The next time I go buy the local music store, I'm busting in there and picking up a copy. I buy MP3s on Google Play for albums that are alright, it the really good ones that I shell out the extra dough for the cds. And I love my cds. You can pry my cds out of my dead fucking hands. I'll just pop one in my stereo (from when we had these things called ""cassettes"", kids), and grab a cold Coke, and listen to some great music.  Enough about me. The album. Absolute favorites were Angels Fall, Breaking the Silence, Hollow, Close to Heaven, Never Again, and Ashes of Eden. The intro/outro were nice, the whole talking thing was a bit reminiscent of Linkin Park's A Thousand Suns (that was a good album, 'nuf bitching about there ""changing sound""). Ben's voice is really excellent, you can hear the versatility on songs like Breaking the Silence, Close to Heaven, and Ashes of Eden.  TL;DR: This is the album that made me a fan."
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,Captain_Scoobysnack,6,Thu Jun 25 01:32:13 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of turned off from the ""screamy"" metal too sometimes but Ben seems to know where it works. I think it's toned down some for this album compared to their other songs. When I hear Failure I almost think it's missing it."
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,ivantowerz,3,Thu Jun 25 22:38:14 2015 UTC,"Woah for a second there I thought you were going to trash the album. But you showed us how defenseless you really are. As a long time fan this album is different and scary to me, but I will adjust like I always do til there's nothing left, the angels will carry me to heaven as I leave it all behind and fade away."
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,fezzo,17,Thu Jun 25 16:33:23 2015 UTC,"Long-time BB fan, and their new album is fantastic in many regards, don't get me wrong. I really feel however that lyrically, it's awfully similar to the tracks that have come in the years before. ""Left behind"", ""nothing left"", ""heaven"", ""angels,"", etc. I think Ben shouldn't be afraid to be more creative and diversify the music, honestly with the loyal fanbase he has, we'll like anything that they make."
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,rhcp88,10,Tue Jun 23 06:40:02 2015 UTC,"As bad or cliche as some say his lyrics are, they are actually one of my favorite things about BB.  I just feel like they are so relateable (to me anyway) and I'm glad he kept the same style on the new album.  I understand where you're coming from though."
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,Geoffmp2012,9,Tue Jun 23 06:44:26 2015 UTC,"I agree! Had this album on repeat since it released and I just zoned. Almost 6 years and they didn't disappoint. I feel bad for anyone who doesn't like them and gets in my car, it will be blared all the time!"
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,Pinkman2012,4,Tue Jun 23 07:15:17 2015 UTC,"""Light the way and let me go"" - Dear Agony/Bury Me Alive    There are a couple other ones(and The Great Divide intro is basically Evil Angel) but that one bothers me the most.    I really like the album but I feel like Ben is capable of more having been through so much professionally and personally."
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,cdsackett,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:59:53 2015 UTC,Knew it sounded familiar.
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,McIgglyTuffMuffin,6,Fri Jun 26 15:46:26 2015 UTC,"I've only listened to it once but I kind of feel the same. Half way through I'm thinking ""this is amazing musically, but man are the lyrics boring.""  It doesn't take away from the album but for some reason I guess I expected something different because of the little hiatus."
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,Den1mChiken,2,Tue Jun 23 12:43:25 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge BB fan, but I've been realizing the lyric thing more and more lately. I think they are definitely capable of being more creative but Ben seems to stick to what the fans liked in the first place. I was going to be a little disappointed in this album if we didn't here at least one different/creative song. Then I heard Ashes of Eden and my faith was restored."
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,ivantowerz,2,Thu Jun 25 07:30:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when you look at his earlier work, it is so cleverly written with lots of variation. Only a few times where he goes back to his stock of phrases. Now he is relying heavily on his bag of catch phrases. Makes me wonder if his lifestyle has deteriorated his writing abilities. I hope the other band members or outside writers will start to help him out with lyrics while still keeping the BB sound signature. But the lyrics aside, the melodies the lyrics create are still top notch"
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,Terwnahh,6,Thu Jun 25 16:21:34 2015 UTC,"Close to heaven is still my favorite despite some others hate for it. I told my buddy, listen to this album a few times through.. it gets better every time!"
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,tamu_phobiA,5,Tue Jun 23 12:39:30 2015 UTC,Dawn is now my alarm every morning
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,fezzo,5,Tue Jun 23 06:55:10 2015 UTC,"It's such a relaxing track. After the intensity of the album and its heavy, syncopated riffs in Drop A#, listening to Dawn was amazing."
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,_Wolverine007_,3,Tue Jun 23 06:58:31 2015 UTC,I'm staying up to listen to it as the sun rises this morning :')
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,jeehbs,4,Tue Jun 23 09:20:00 2015 UTC,What does he sing in the Breaking the Silence chorus?
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,That-1-White-Guy,3,Tue Jun 23 08:16:51 2015 UTC,"not sure either, if you mean the scream, i think it starts with wake up"
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,JahamaLlama,6,Tue Jun 23 14:31:03 2015 UTC,"The lyric booklet says ""Wake up the victim of violence, shut the breath of the lifeless""  Breaking the Silence is a damn amazing song, has to be my favourite from the album."

BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,McIgglyTuffMuffin,6,Tue Jun 23 21:41:52 2015 UTC,I'm wondering if the heart beat sounds in Dawn are those of his unborn child. The ultrasound is the album cover so it isn't too farfetched for the child's heart beat to be in the music..
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,rhcp88,5,Wed Jun 24 03:26:17 2015 UTC,It is.  /u/JahamaLlama uploaded the booklet & it's in the liner notes
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,McIgglyTuffMuffin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:55:31 2015 UTC,That's just so absolutely wonderful.
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,MA0801,4,Wed Jun 24 04:02:28 2015 UTC,"Love every song on the album but I'd have to say that Never Again is my least favourite, I really like the song but it just doesn't have that hook that all the others have. I think Breaking the Silence, Hollow or Ashes of Eden are my favourite songs so far.  I've had a few days to listen to the album due to the leaked version, I did buy the album on the Google Play Store today though."
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,Symtex123,5,Tue Jun 23 13:03:32 2015 UTC,"I'm just so happy its not awful, I have been let down by many bands that I once really liked. I came in with very little expectations and I'm surprised that I'm enjoying it so much.  Also Break the Silence makes me want to seriously throw down."
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,lukeinfamous,3,Tue Jun 23 17:04:16 2015 UTC,"Fuckin' love this album, Breaking the Silence is def my new fav.  Also, it's so refreshing to here new material but with the same sounds and style. All my other bands evolved over time but its so nostalgic to be able to put on the headphones and hear tunes that you'd love when you were 14."
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,derpes,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:38:46 2015 UTC,That exactly describes how I felt when I heard the first track this morning
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,ImaginaryMan,3,Wed Jun 24 11:34:22 2015 UTC,"Can we get a link to the thread where the guy said he was worried that Dark before Dawn was going to be terrible?  Can we all agree that guy's fears did not come to fruition and that's a really, really, REALLY good thing?"
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,coelurosauravus,3,Tue Jun 23 22:45:15 2015 UTC,"feels old, but new.  Ben's voice is haunting and it feels like time has given him a well to pull some material out instead of 2 or 3 year frames where material feels forced.  I havent bought an actual hard physical CD in years, and this broke the streak.  admittedly im only at close to heaven, long way to go still.  Im absolutely pleased that our patience as fans paid off.  This was worth the wait.  edit: my only criticism, the three pre released songs dont do the justice of the entire album (sometimes they cant).  The great divide, ashes of eden, and dawn sit on the end and close out the album in an absolutely beautiful finale.    What i love about BB is that they can create these masterful rock tracks, and then finish with rain or forever like past albums.  This ending had just that same kind of feel."
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,MizoreGaming,2,Wed Jun 24 02:33:55 2015 UTC,It's good! The haven't changed at all!
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,Nocturne501,2,Tue Jun 23 15:39:34 2015 UTC,Good lord this album is amazing and Ive only listened to half of it.
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,avalidname,2,Tue Jun 23 19:22:43 2015 UTC,"Yes it is awfully similar to previous albums. Probably to a fault.   However, any doubt that the new band couldn't measure up to the new one has been removed.   I like this album and am very exited for future work to come."
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,AdrianHD,2,Tue Jun 23 21:57:34 2015 UTC,"I think I remember reading that most of this was written before the new assembly. But if that's so, then perhaps the next album will experiment some more."
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,Captain_Scoobysnack,2,Wed Jun 24 20:09:11 2015 UTC,"I don't like this album as much as their other ones. Maybe I need to listen through a few more times. I'm happy we got some new BB, its been a long wait but this album seems kind of meh to me.  Edit: After hearing it a few more times I do like it a lot more now. I think I felt the same way about Dear Agony when I first heard it. I think I'm just hoping for another Phobia with each release."
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,kelsfishie,2,Wed Jun 24 01:09:00 2015 UTC,"Guitar and drums are mostly what I love about BB, but goddamn Ashes of Eden shows exactly how beautiful Ben's voice is (and his songwriting). This album is amazing!"
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,baconbash,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:34:21 2015 UTC,You do realize this is a new guitarist and a new drummer?
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,kelsfishie,3,Thu Jun 25 02:05:38 2015 UTC,"Lol yes, but I was under the impression that Ben did most of the songwriting/ instrument writing for his albums. This may have been an incorrect assumption, so please correct me if I'm wrong."
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,Howarda0551,2,Thu Jun 25 02:20:49 2015 UTC,Actual goosebumps from every single song on this album. Why can't they all be #1 hits? I would love to hear them all on the radio!!!!
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,citieskid,3,Fri Jun 26 00:34:16 2015 UTC,Close To Heaven is incredible! But honestly I am enjoying the entire album. This blows Dear Agony out of the water.
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,_Wolverine007_,3,Tue Jun 23 14:35:25 2015 UTC,"Easily the most underrated song on the album, I love how it builds!"
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,fireguy286,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:02:12 2015 UTC,Definitely get the CD if you can. It's a way better mix than the download. I have both.

BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,equilibrium02,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:13:34 2015 UTC,"This album gets better and better with each listen.  It's very much Breaking Benjamin.  Not much has changed, which both works well within the album's tracks and kind of brings it down a little bit.  I would have liked to have seen a little experimentation or have the songwriting branch out a little more.  Many of these songs are similar sounding (a common criticism for all their albums) but that said, this album is just fucking fantastic!  Dark is an excellent opener.  Failure, Angels Fall, and Defeated were excellent single choices but the truly great songs on here are Hollow, Close to Heaven, and The Great Divide.  Ashes of Eden is the real gem on this album and it's a beautiful song, and Bury Me Alive is my favorite track.  Breaking the Silence and Never Again are my least favorite tracks.  They're not bad songs, but they feel like throwaways compared to what comes before and what comes after.  Overall, a solid comeback and one that gets better with every listen.  I'm glad these guys are back and I'm happy to finally have this album released."
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,MountEverett,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:53:37 2015 UTC,Ashes of Eden is my favorite. Such a good song. Reminds me a lot of Give me a Sign
BreakingBenjamin,3asvaz,go2kejdz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:37:14 2015 UTC,I like how Dark is the 1st song and Dawn is last. It's literally Dark before Dawn.

BreakingBenjamin,3ase9q,jakaedahsnakae,3,Tue Jun 23 03:18:07 2015 UTC,So glad I found this sub. It's been fun sharing this last week with all of you. :)
BreakingBenjamin,3asqc5,Elephant44,4,Tue Jun 23 05:13:17 2015 UTC,I listened to the three released songs so much more compared to the rest so I'll keep those out for now.  My top 3 right now would be:   Ashes of Eden The Great Divide Hollow
BreakingBenjamin,3asqc5,rhcp88,3,Tue Jun 23 06:13:30 2015 UTC,"Bury Me Alive The song is just so epic and almost everything that I love about Breaking Benjamin and music in general.   Ashes of Eden At first I didn't get what all the fuss is about... But then I listened more, like I listened, and now I think it's one of their best songs ever. It's just a beautiful song.   Breaking the Silence Another song that just feels absolutely epic and I love the intensity of it."
BreakingBenjamin,3asqc5,element116,2,Tue Jun 23 05:23:41 2015 UTC,"I really don't like Bury Me Alive's verses. They're really monotonous and boring. I realise Ben probably wanted a monotonous, almost droning verse, but I just don't dig it."
BreakingBenjamin,3asqc5,DeanCutty,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:07:30 2015 UTC,"I kinda feel the same way, it might actually be my least favorite song on the album if I had to pick one.  Don't get me wrong, I still like it.  But those verses are a little too Korn-ish for me.  And I do like Korn but not in my BB songs lol."
BreakingBenjamin,3asqc5,rhcp88,3,Tue Jun 23 17:50:38 2015 UTC,"This entire album is fantastic in my opinion.  1.) Dawn      Ben's journey through his music comes to this song. It's everything I envisioned when I first read the title of the album and saw the track list. I just knew that his son would be a significant turning point for him in spite of his health and former band mate issues.  2.) Breaking the Silence     We've been waiting for one of these tracks. I love it so much  3.) Dark -> Failure      I mean, I can't really limit it to 3. It's so hard, which makes this album great. I just love how intros fall into the next song. (You can also follow Dark with Diary of Jane because it's in A#)"
BreakingBenjamin,3asqc5,tamu_phobiA,3,Tue Jun 23 06:01:36 2015 UTC,"1) Breaking the Silence. I love a good, heavy groove, and this fits the bill. I actually like the rap-esque growls he does during the chorus, kinda like he did for ""Sugarcoat"" on the first album.   2) Close to Heaven. That. Epic. Chorus.   3) Angels Fall. I thought it was a cool song when I first heard it, but it quickly grew on me. Sounds like a poppy-sounding arena anthem, and I LOVE it."
BreakingBenjamin,3asqc5,hehasthejazzhands,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:22:47 2015 UTC,man angels fall is by far my favorite song on the whole album. seems to be more of an unpopular opinion here hahha
BreakingBenjamin,3asqc5,aipom1000,3,Tue Jun 23 08:08:11 2015 UTC,"Breaking The Silence - Reminds me of ""Believe"" specifically and Saturate feel-wise. Close To Heaven - Insanely good chorus and that vocal drop at 2:46... Actually epic. I... Don't know yet... Ashes of Eden perhaps, because of how different it is.   [EDIT]: Actually, Never Again is absolutely fantastic! Sorry, Ashes of Eden!"
BreakingBenjamin,3asqc5,DeanCutty,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:10:47 2015 UTC,Never Again is possibly my favorite on the whole album.
BreakingBenjamin,3asqc5,jalexander86,2,Thu Jul 9 18:21:52 2015 UTC,"My 3 are the ones released early. Lol. But like you said, the others will grow on me I think. Not a fan of dark and dawn...they just feel like the intros/outros other bands do. And like those, I never listen to them. The others I can think of is GC's intro on Young and the Hopeless or Tinfoil on Linkin Parks Living Things"
BreakingBenjamin,3aqwu7,XxShrimpTacoxX,6,Mon Jun 22 19:58:29 2015 UTC,"I feel that the intro of Dance with the Devil and theth song as a whole is the highlight of the album, tho You fight me is a fitting closing song."

BreakingBenjamin,3al6af,GeorgedaflashGlass,2,Sun Jun 21 18:02:38 2015 UTC,I don't think Disturbed is very similar...TDG was going to be my suggestion. That's about the only similar band I can think of.

BreakingBenjamin,3al6af,friedjellybeans,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:19:06 2015 UTC,"For bands that are in the exact same realm as BB, definitely Red, Chevelle, Evans Blue and Parabelle were mentioned I think.     As for other bands, I'm really into Demon Hunter's late work, like Extremist or True Defiance. 10 Years has a lot of good material, really cool leads and time signatures. Crossfade's ""We All Bleed"" is also a really great album, although short."
BreakingBenjamin,3al6af,_Wolverine007_,2,Mon Jun 22 08:57:48 2015 UTC,"10 Years is awesome, they sound alot like Chevelle"
BreakingBenjamin,3al6af,friedjellybeans,2,Tue Jun 23 09:26:51 2015 UTC,"I love 10 Years. I still prefer Ben's voice and BB's lyrics, but to me Jesse(vocal) and Ryan(guitar and backing voice) from 10 Years are extremely creative when working together. They have their ups and downs, but their ups are phenomenal. A lot of people just know them for Wasteland but honestly, that is one of my lesser favorites, even though it's still good."
BreakingBenjamin,3aln8n,Authonix,2,Sun Jun 21 12:43:36 2015 UTC,"So it does seem like the band is officially endorsed by ESP now, at least Jasen is. That's good news for me, since I've been an ESP fan for over a decade now :D I also forgot that LTD did a yellow EC-401VF. I thought it was an EC-256 the whole time.   EDIT: I also wish he talked about his baritone, which I'm pretty sure is a current model. It looks like it was frankensteined to hell and back with a bunch of new knobs, killswitches, and pickups."
BreakingBenjamin,3aln8n,hehasthejazzhands,2,Sun Jun 21 19:03:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I was looking into ESP when I saw the interview there. They have some really nice guitars. Do you know which guitar Ben has that he keep in drop C- C#? It looks like the EC-1000 VB Duncan but a can't be sure.
BreakingBenjamin,3aln8n,hehasthejazzhands,2,Mon Jun 22 04:37:24 2015 UTC,"He uses two EC-1000 VBs with Duncans, yeah. You can tell they're two different guitars because of how the volume knobs are placed.  If you want something like that guitar, but slightly cheaper, ESP makes one called the EC-401 VB. It has EMGs, though.   Jasen seems to use the EC-401VF Lemon Drop, but the DiMarzio PAFS are swapped for Duncans. The black guitar SEEMS to be an old EC-400AT. His baritone is a MH-401B FM with an arcade-style killswitch installed (to do the stutter effect for the intro of Failure)."
BreakingBenjamin,3ak5uv,HailWolf,6,Sun Jun 21 00:12:53 2015 UTC,Haha. That was humorous. Ben's a funny guy.
BreakingBenjamin,3ai3w9,Authonix,3,Sat Jun 20 11:46:02 2015 UTC,"Wait, so that story about how Ben dropped a microphone, and the host saying ""Thanks to Benjamin for breaking my fucking microphone"" wasn't how they came up with 'Breaking Benjamin'?"
BreakingBenjamin,3ai3w9,fezzo,2,Sat Jun 20 17:26:18 2015 UTC,"That's what I've heard as well, a few years back. Never knew about any stickers."
BreakingBenjamin,3ai3w9,ToffeeKing,2,Sat Jun 20 20:01:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting! They seem to have fun and work well together. Fun to hear Aaron is also left-handed - and I first saw Ben write and text with his left years ago, but have never heard him comment on it until now."
BreakingBenjamin,3ai3w9,ToffeeKing,2,Sat Jun 20 15:15:31 2015 UTC,Yeah I knew about Ben being left handed from a live show I watched on YouTube somewhere. Didn't know about Aaron. I like how much fun they are having together. Ben really gets along well with everyone notably Keith. It's good to see them enjoying themselves looks like they may hang around for a while or until Ben gets to sick to continue.
BreakingBenjamin,3ai3w9,Vubberth,2,Sat Jun 20 15:27:45 2015 UTC,"I didn't understand the whole thing with the stickers. Did the stickers say ""Breaking Benjamin"" on them or something?"

BreakingBenjamin,3af9ej,friedjellybeans,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:31:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks, man. I have a presonus firebox interfaced with my computer.

BreakingBenjamin,3af9ej,friedjellybeans,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:59:58 2015 UTC,Nice! I use presonus also and studio one. Never been able to get vocals that clean though

BreakingBenjamin,3af9ej,DeanCutty,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:44:55 2015 UTC,Volume level or tone?
BreakingBenjamin,3af9ej,DeanCutty,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:50:24 2015 UTC,"Tone, but this is only my opinion, some people enjoy a little grit with acoustic... One of my favorite albums is parabelles acoustic ""Air"" so if you are familiar I enjoy acoustic with a soft tone all around."
BreakingBenjamin,3af9ej,DeanCutty,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:57:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it fell in such a strange part of my range that the rasp sounded better than the clean tone. That's why the song changed from Dear Agony to Dear Agon-eh :p"
BreakingBenjamin,3af9ej,KazuyaAnno,2,Fri Jun 19 20:18:50 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think the rasp is required for a song about agony, quite frankly. It's a tortured song, the vocals should reflect that. Job well done, mate. :)"
BreakingBenjamin,3af9ej,ShiaLaBuff,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:45:37 2015 UTC,I've been thinking of doing an acoustic cover of a song... Undecided as to which one though.
BreakingBenjamin,3agbx7,Vubberth,6,Fri Jun 19 22:33:22 2015 UTC,"Bury Me Alive. The scream in this song is absurd. Breaking the Silence. Believe is one of my favorite songs and this one was a lot like it. Failure. Hard to admit it because I listened to it so much I got sick of it, but it's a really great song. Ashes of Eden. Reminded me of Better Days, but I like the lyrics and melodies in this one better. Defeated slightly edges out Never Again and Closer to Heaven.   Angels Fall and Great Divide were pretty good but not outstanding to me, and Hollow was probably my least favorite."
BreakingBenjamin,3agbx7,Jakexx360,4,Fri Jun 19 22:49:15 2015 UTC,"Really? Hollow is definitely one of my top 3. I love the effects on his voice, and the chorus is super catchy. The leads remind me of something off of Phobia, plus, solo? I got goosebumps. I also believe the lyrics from Hollow are among the best of the whole album.     As for Bury Me Alive, I must have somehow skipped that one on my CD when I listened to the album in my car. The song I remember with the most screaming was Breaking The Silence.     I guess I have no choice but to listen to listen to the album again.... curses... how terrible... fuck yes"
BreakingBenjamin,3agbx7,friedjellybeans,3,Sat Jun 20 06:24:21 2015 UTC,"I agree, Hollow might be 2nd favorite behind Ashes."
BreakingBenjamin,3agbx7,rhcp88,2,Sat Jun 20 19:47:16 2015 UTC,"To me Hollow sounded a little too typical Breaking Benjamin I guess, it kind of fit right in and I forgot about it even after a few listenings. Break the Silence has a screaming verse like Believe does, but Bury Me Alive has two huge deep yells that are really impressive."
BreakingBenjamin,3agbx7,Jakexx360,2,Sat Jun 20 07:03:40 2015 UTC,That's my exact top 5. You and me have a lot in common in music terms.
BreakingBenjamin,3agbx7,FirekidFM,3,Sat Jun 20 01:13:47 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of the louder, more riff-focused songs like Believe, Simple Design, Break the Silence, Breakdown, Firefly, and Blow Me Away. If those kind of songs tend to be your favorite, I think it's a match! Always willing to appreciate the instrumentals and lighter stuff like Ashes of Eden and Rain, as well - especially the Diary of Jane acoustic. How about that Dark intro to the new album? Feels really impressive compared to the intro from Phobia."
BreakingBenjamin,3agbx7,Jakexx360,2,Sat Jun 20 07:07:31 2015 UTC,I do believe that we have the same appreciation for music. I just have one question. Are you also into the lighter/heavy music of FFDP? If so then I believe that we have a match! Also the Dark intro was amazing.
BreakingBenjamin,3agbx7,FirekidFM,2,Sat Jun 20 16:31:08 2015 UTC,"FFDP comes on Spotify radio all the time because of the genres I generally listen to, despite enjoying them quite a bit I couldn't quite call myself a fan because I'm only familiar with some of their most successful songs. Big fan of Shinedown, Avenged Sevenfold, Rise Against, Thousand Foot Krutch, and related artists, though."
BreakingBenjamin,3agbx7,Jakexx360,2,Sat Jun 20 16:35:35 2015 UTC,Yup we have the same taste in music. What about like the old Three Days Grace or Disturbed?
BreakingBenjamin,3agbx7,FirekidFM,2,Sat Jun 20 18:10:21 2015 UTC,"The first two albums of Three Days Grace are phenomenal, and I went through a Disturbed phase a couple years back and have all their albums. I love David Draiman and his new project Device. Industrial Metal is a damn interesting genre, especially with Draiman at the head of it."
BreakingBenjamin,3agbx7,Jakexx360,3,Sat Jun 20 18:50:09 2015 UTC,Ashes of Eden number one.  The rest are awesome but that track is above them all to me.
BreakingBenjamin,3agbx7,rhcp88,2,Fri Jun 19 22:42:53 2015 UTC,"I haven't listened to the full album, but Angels Fall is by far my favorite."

My ranking of the songs are subject to change with the more times I listen to them.
BreakingBenjamin,3agbx7,Crash_Burn_Death,2,Sat Jun 20 00:59:26 2015 UTC,"Defeated Never Again Hollow The Great Divide Failure Angels Fall Bury Me Alive Ashes of Eden Breaking the Silence Close to Heaven   I quite like them all, but I'd have to say Breaking the Silence and Close to Heaven don't really drag me in like the other songs do."
BreakingBenjamin,3agbx7,pewe120,2,Sat Jun 20 01:19:42 2015 UTC,Do I have to put them in order? I don't like singling out ones because it makes the ones below look worse when they really aren't.  Can I just leave an un-numbered album list?

BreakingBenjamin,3agbx7,ToffeeKing,2,Sat Jun 20 20:36:25 2015 UTC,"Once I get over the Had Enough intro, I love The Great Divide. I can jam this forever. Breaking the Silence, Ashes of Eden, Bury Me Alive, & Hollow are my other favs."

BreakingBenjamin,3agbx7,RsmvJake,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:54:11 2015 UTC,"Ashes of Eden - beautiful slower along that really shows the amazingness of Ben's vocals The Great Divide - I love the background vocals where it blends with the main ones so great to listen to Close to Heaven - I have no idea, just when I did the first play it stuck with me after listening to every other song Angels Fall - super catchy chorus and really reminds me of the older Breaking Benjamin Failure - first single, maybe I like it because I was so excited for BB to come back but I love it nonetheless"

His phobias kept him from flying anywhere, meaning they stayed in the States.  This article is probably about nothing other than him just talking."
BreakingBenjamin,3a9jgf,Tamparockout17,3,Thu Jun 18 17:08:55 2015 UTC,"hypochondria   maybe,  but I think it's more alluding to his being a victim to Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome."

BreakingBenjamin,3a612y,tamu_phobiA,2,Wed Jun 17 15:34:33 2015 UTC,I think The Great Divide sounds more musically similar to Evil Angel than Close to Heaven...Interesting
BreakingBenjamin,3a612y,mikeo490,3,Wed Jun 17 15:38:45 2015 UTC,"The intro of Great Divide and the drums on the verse sound exactly like Evil Angel, you're correct!  Maybe it's just the chorus:  ""So I'll stay unforgiven"" v.s. ""Put me to sleep Evil Angel"""
BreakingBenjamin,3a612y,tamu_phobiA,3,Wed Jun 17 15:50:27 2015 UTC,"I saw someone saying that Close to Heaven was kind of generic? I mean, most of BB music is a bit generic, to an extent, but I feel like Close to Heaven is really emotive, and it's definitely my favourite song on the album right now. If you judge the song on the verses, then I can see people being slightly underwhelmed, but that chorus and the middle-eight really brings the song to life, I think."

I think it's the same direction it's always been going in, but Dear Agony had a really concentrated sound, whereas the previous albums had a little more variety among the tracks. I think DBD is definitely a return to form, and I'm really happy to hear Ben experimenting a little more again."
BreakingBenjamin,3a5mhe,iamkazlan,3,Wed Jun 17 17:27:58 2015 UTC,"Just gave the album a third run through. I feel it is at the top of my BB albums now. Songs I enjoy the most: Ashes Of Eden, Never Again, Close to Heaven. I love the feel of Breaking the Silence... A lot heavier than I have seen Ben go before. Entire album will not be leaving my daily playlist for a long time."
BreakingBenjamin,3a5mhe,kenobi112,3,Wed Jun 17 21:24:23 2015 UTC,"The thing I love about Close to Heaven is that just when you think it's gonna kick in and get heavy, it goes so soft and gentle as he sings 'so I'll stay unforgiven'.  Fuck it, gonna listen to it now."
BreakingBenjamin,3a5mhe,_Wolverine007_,3,Wed Jun 17 22:51:26 2015 UTC,"That song builds so fucking much! It constantly drops and builds back up, I love it!"
BreakingBenjamin,3a5mhe,steelsharkstudios,2,Wed Jun 17 23:12:36 2015 UTC,just finished listening for the first time...definitely good...more testing is required though
BreakingBenjamin,3a5mhe,ToffeeKing,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:14:28 2015 UTC,"I've had a pretty similar reaction. Had to listen through it a few times, but it might be my favourite album. Before, when only Failure, Angels Fall and Defeated had come out, I was worried that it sounded too much like earlier albums - Dear Agony in particular. But after hearing the rest, I think it's different enough from Ben's earlier songs and definitely a step up from DA (which was my favourite album until now). I guess I prefer his new, ""sober"" musical style. But the screaming in Breaking the Silence is amazing. My favourites so far are Hollow, Breaking the Silence, Close to Heaven and Ashes of Eden. Commented in the lyrics post on the last one that I think it's the best song Ben has ever made, and that's really saying something."
BreakingBenjamin,3a5mhe,SgtShadow,4,Wed Jun 17 12:39:26 2015 UTC,"Ashes of Eden is a genuinely beautiful song, his voice just sounds so vulnerable in a way, like everything has just been stripped down so it's just him and some music, almost sounds like a genuine plea to heaven."
BreakingBenjamin,3a5mhe,iamkazlan,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:09:25 2015 UTC,I'm only on my second listen and I'm currently listening to Never Again and it's in my top favorite right now as is Breaking The Silence. I still need a few listens of the other songs before I can officially decide. I love it though! My least favorite so far is. Close to Heaven but I'm sure that will change.
BreakingBenjamin,3a5mhe,TootinEggz,2,Wed Jun 17 13:04:29 2015 UTC,"Never Again seems like the most generic and haphazard of the songs on DBD, but somehow it's super cool to me? I think it's actually kind of adorable, and I absolutely love it."
BreakingBenjamin,3a5mhe,DeanCutty,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:26:31 2015 UTC,"I have listened to the album once over. Now, I may be biased as these guys are my favorite (hands down), but it gave me an erection so fierce that the rest of my body almost shut down due to blood loss.   So far I have been enjoying the song Hollow the most. I need to give the album a few more listens to really let it set in, but I feel this was not a weak effort whatsoever."
BreakingBenjamin,3a5mhe,mynameisntpete,2,Thu Jun 18 22:48:03 2015 UTC,"Dat solo in Hollow tho.  Seriously, I can't wait to learn all this shit on guitar, I've already learned Ashes of Eden, Failure, Angels Fall and Defeated. Hollow is gonna be the tricky one.  This album gets better every time you listen to it, fucking love it so much."

BreakingBenjamin,3a5mhe,DeanCutty,5,Wed Jun 17 14:28:15 2015 UTC,It is definitely not soaked in pitch correction
BreakingBenjamin,3a5mhe,lostmesa,-1,Wed Jun 17 15:27:53 2015 UTC,"It's not pitch correction,  but there definitely is a lot of vocal processing going on. He's always done that though, think Lights Out."
BreakingBenjamin,3a5mhe,_Wolverine007_,2,Wed Jun 17 17:47:36 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong; love the song, and I'm interested to see how he does live. I know it's ridiculous to compare live vocal fidelity to a recording's, by the way, I'm just curious."
BreakingBenjamin,3a5mhe,DeanCutty,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:07:33 2015 UTC,"Yea,  I like it too. I'm sure he'll own it live. I've seen them multiple times and his voice sounded amazing, I was really,  really impressed."

BreakingBenjamin,3a1wz7,Myredditaccount33,5,Tue Jun 16 16:18:16 2015 UTC,"The lyrics have a lot of meaning.  I've only listened through once also, but Ashes of Eden particularly almost made me tear up a bit.  There is so much emotion put into this album, like all of BB's albums.  This one seems a bit more positive than the others though."
BreakingBenjamin,3a1wz7,rhcp88,3,Tue Jun 16 17:46:22 2015 UTC,"I drove home from work last night at 2 in the morning playing Ashes of Eden with all the windows down and nobody else on the road. It was so serene. I had this feeling that if I could just keep on driving down that road, in that moment, for the rest of my life - I would reach heaven."
BreakingBenjamin,3a1wz7,_Wolverine007_,3,Wed Jun 17 23:33:18 2015 UTC,"(Sorry but will probably get pretty religious)   I think it's overall one story about rekindling his faith/clinging to it after tragedy of sickness (this is how I see it at least, but that is mostly because I relate to it so well, renaming faithful through battle with cancer)   The singer/songwriter was incredibly sick while writing this and still is.   I do think there are several references to the bible. ""I'll be yours forever, and I'll sleep close to heaven.""  Basically the entire ""never again"" lyric can be seen as a savior figure talking to someone they want to save (to me this means Jesus towards a sick person, giving them comfort whether they love or die)  Some of the angsty lyrics can go back to evil angel and diary of Jane.  (Again, my own opinion, most likely not Burnley's)   Evil Angel: ""I'm a believer, nothing could be worse...""  Diary of Jane: ""As I burn another page..."" ""I still try to find my place""   I see this as somebody being scared that they aren't good enough for heaven. He (the character/me) believes it's real, but it scared him, making him think that he won't ever make it there.   Dark Before Dawn continues this story, by giving him more acceptance. He knows something will happen and he isn't as scared anymore, and it allows him build a relationship with Jesus.   This could probably be taken other ways, much more secular ways with simar meaning. Maybe somebody's significant other. He is showing weakness and establishing a strong relationship with them that proves he doesn't have to be scared to die, because he will either stay in their memory or live beside them longer."
BreakingBenjamin,3a1wz7,Thisisalsomypass,2,Wed Jun 17 04:19:06 2015 UTC,Appreciate the comment. Yeah now it makes more sense. I'm not really a Jesus person so I can't really get a connection to that. But still it's some bad ass music and I love it! Congrats on the cancer battle!

BreakingBenjamin,3a1wz7,roadkillyarn,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:14:39 2015 UTC,"I think one listen-through is tough to really attach yourself to any one song in particular. For me at least, I just enjoy the song the first time, and then really dig in as I replay each and every one"
BreakingBenjamin,3a1wz7,Vubberth,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:00:27 2015 UTC,"I definitely understand what you're saying. Not all, but most of their songs are all over the place lyric-wise. This goes back to Saturate with songs like ""Next to Nothing"" but is especially prevalent in Dear Agony and Dark Before Dawn. That's not to say that the band isn't good or that their songs are meaningless, but many of their lyrics are hard to relate to unless you decide to decipher the poetry a certain way.  More specific to your question, there are certainly some songs on Dark Before Dawn with clear meaning. Angels Fall, Defeated (and perhaps Close to Heaven) are about holding on to faith after tragedy or a breakup. I can definitely see some disconnect with this album if the listener isn't particularly religious because a lot of the message is. Ashes to Eden is certainly an emotional song but I would argue that it's more open-ended than what OP is looking for.  I think we can all agree that no matter the meaning, it's good music!"
BreakingBenjamin,3a1wz7,That-1-White-Guy,2,Wed Jun 17 02:11:01 2015 UTC,It is good music! I'm just not that religious myself  Deciphering the poetry is a great way to out it it's pretty hard for me with this album

BreakingBenjamin,3a082t,Phobiass,15,Tue Jun 16 05:14:48 2015 UTC,Oh dear god it's magnificent :')
BreakingBenjamin,3a082t,arielmayer,9,Tue Jun 16 05:54:55 2015 UTC,It's absolutely fantastic. It sounds so full and melodic.
BreakingBenjamin,3a082t,tamu_phobiA,10,Tue Jun 16 05:57:08 2015 UTC,"Close to Heaven is pretty different. It sounds like Ben just wanted to jam some lyrics with some music. Bury Me Alive - Guitar is great. ""Light the way and let me go"" recycled straight from Dear Agony. Ben's whispers are quite new. Dark is AMAZING. It could stand alone as a song, which is unusual for an intro like Phobia (Intro). It's the song from which the teaser from Fall 2014 comes. It should be it's own album. Hollow -  The chorus is amazing though! ""Don't you drag me down again."" said so matter-of-factly with a great bass melody. The Great Divide definitely has the most voice mixing. It's weird to hear it from Ben though. The album is closer to Dear Agony. Bury Me Alive - Has the voice elements of Believe (""Shut up, smart little bitch! Confined inside!""). Very good. Ashes of Eden - Most cathartic, personal song he's ever done in my opinion. Ben's clear voice - almost not even singing. Makes you feel like Anthem of the Angels or Dear Agony does. The song sounds like a beautiful deathbed plea to God or an angel. Not annoying though. Dawn - You've got to love how it starts with his baby's heartbeat, then that turns into the rhythm.   For those wondering about biblical references, they are definitely present. It's not annoying though. Most prevalent in The Great Divide.  My opinion:   Failure  Dark (VERY GOOD! FANTASTIC! SHOULD BE A SINGLE!) Hollow Dawn - sounds has heartbeat sounds (presumably for baby son) Ashes of Eden ... Damn Never Again Bury Me Alive Defeated Angels Fall Breaking the Silence The Great Divide Close to Heaven"
BreakingBenjamin,3a082t,HailWolf,7,Tue Jun 16 06:11:01 2015 UTC,"If those are your top 5, I have a very different list.   Breaking the Silence Ashes of Eden Bury Me Alive Angels Fall Hollow"
BreakingBenjamin,3a082t,HailWolf,5,Tue Jun 16 06:36:24 2015 UTC,The beginning and ending of Failure make it #1 to me.
BreakingBenjamin,3a082t,HailWolf,5,Tue Jun 16 06:37:28 2015 UTC,"I love the song, but I connect to the others a lot more. Well, as of now. I'm sure my list will change 20 times lol"
BreakingBenjamin,3a082t,rhcp88,5,Tue Jun 16 06:39:25 2015 UTC,I'm constantly changing mine. It's a goddamn shame that I can't put Hollow on repeat. The chorus is fantastic.
BreakingBenjamin,3a082t,Vubberth,3,Tue Jun 16 06:44:39 2015 UTC,Ashes of Eden is incredible.  What a song.
BreakingBenjamin,3a082t,HailWolf,2,Tue Jun 16 06:45:38 2015 UTC,"When you say Hollow had ""the voice elements of Believe"" I definitely think you were talking about Breaking the Silence. Hollow is a relatively light song."
BreakingBenjamin,3a082t,Vubberth,3,Tue Jun 16 19:31:25 2015 UTC,"You're right. I was stopping and starting the songs while typing out the lyrics, so I got jumbled."

BreakingBenjamin,3a082t,Studio1417,6,Tue Jun 16 20:04:23 2015 UTC,You're my hero for letting me know about this.  This album is amazing. It's like the best sounds of the first four albums combined into one with its own flavor. This is going to sit on repeat in my car for a long time.
BreakingBenjamin,3a082t,HailWolf,6,Tue Jun 16 05:42:49 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! I'm surprised at how much screaming some songs have, in a good way. Also by how soft some are. I'm loving everything about this CD. I think Breaking the Silence is my favorite so far, but I've only made it to The Great Divide at the moment."
BreakingBenjamin,3a082t,CraziBoi94,3,Tue Jun 16 05:47:15 2015 UTC,"Really highlight's Ben's talent in my opinion.  Also, my favorite part of the album so far is definitely how it takes you on a journey from the first track to the last. Starts off with a cry of despair and ends with hopeful elation."
BreakingBenjamin,3a082t,ToffeeKing,4,Tue Jun 16 05:59:38 2015 UTC,Definitely. Each song has a pretty awesome story.
BreakingBenjamin,3a082t,RedStag86,5,Tue Jun 16 06:16:58 2015 UTC,It's so good!   I love you so much!
BreakingBenjamin,3a082t,A_Zombie_Riot,6,Tue Jun 16 05:57:30 2015 UTC,After waiting 5 years for this shit..... totally fucking worth it.

I feel when I listen to it more, I will eventually cry listening to it like I did with Dear Agony. Beautiful songs.  Fantastic album! Though these 5 years were rough waiting for a new album, I'm glad we got this masterpiece. Possibly their best, IMO."
BreakingBenjamin,3a082t,Magikarpe_Diem_,2,Tue Jun 16 19:11:19 2015 UTC,"No shame, I definitely cried the first (and second) time I listened to Ashes of Eden. It's a beautiful song."

BreakingBenjamin,3a082t,_Wolverine007_,4,Tue Jun 16 14:03:57 2015 UTC,Guarantee by the end of the day there's a leak torrent
BreakingBenjamin,3a082t,1800KitchenFire,4,Tue Jun 16 14:07:03 2015 UTC,"List written after two listens to the full album.   Dark - I immediately recognized this song from the preview on Facebook. Very similar to Phobia's ""Intro"" with the soft vocals and sound effects. The guitar also has a Tool feel to it, which is really cool. If you remember back to Saturate when Breaking Benjamin was taking a huge cue from the work of Tool, this song kind of heralds the album as something that builds on their older styles, which I liked. Failure - I like this song, and it's a good song. However, I think it made it to the top of the Mainstream Rock Charts simply by virtue of it being BB's comeback. Again, I don't hate the song at all, but it's far from the best on the album. ""Angels Fall"" or ""Defeated"" would have been better picks for the chart spot, in my opinion. The vocals and guitar are top-notch as always but the lyrics seem a bit generic, even for Ben. ""Bury the sunlight""? You lost me. Angels Fall - I love this song. Like many of my favorite Breaking Benjamin songs, the verses are just as catchy as the chorus. You can tell a lot of time went into making the vocals sound great for this song and it really paid off. The quiet/loud dynamic really just... makes the whole thing. Breaking the Silence - This song sounds so much like a Red song, which is by no means a bad thing. It's like a definitive blend of the two bands. The chorus especially reminds me of harder BB songs like ""Sugarcoat"" and ""Believe"" which happen to be some of my favorites. The drumming is also surprisingly complex on this track if you listen for it. Hollow - Does he say ""demoralized"" at the beginning? This is bugging the heck out of me. Anyway, this song sounds a lot like ""Here We Are"" off of Phobia to me during the verses, while the chorus sounds like their Dear Agony style. Overall I think this is a pretty unique song for Breaking Benjamin who usually stick to a familiar sound. The guitar work is also phenomenal on this track, possibly the best outside of ""Defeated"" to me. Close to Heaven - The chorus is all over the place on this song, another departure from the usual Breaking Benjamin style. This song has generally been met with ""meh"" from what I've seen, and I can kind of see why. I wouldn't say it's a bad song and I certainly wouldn't call it filler, but Ben seems a bit off his vocal game here. I think if the chorus had built straight up from the quiet part instead of hopping all over the place it would have been easier to digest. Also, random banging on an oil drum near the end of the song. It was kind of cool. Overall this one might grow on you, just give it time. Bury Me Alive - I love this sweet intro. One of the things Breaking Benjamin does best. The verses don't end very smoothly which tarnishes the song for me, but the chorus is sick and definitely a winner on this album. The screams are rather un-Benjamin, in my opinion, but they aren't intrusive and are actually kind of nice in the chorus. Aside from that one nitpick, ""suffocate inside"" is a cop-out lyric. I just can't let that one slide. Never Again - Outside of a few covers, I haven't really disliked a Breaking Benjamin song on any of their four albums. They're notorious for avoiding filler and putting a lot of work into their craft. However, this song is weak. Maybe it will grow on me later, but I am actually really let down by this song. The rhythm is weak, the lyrics are very weak and often hardly rhyme, and the repetition is grating especially near the end. However, this song does have a saving grace. The scream at the end of the chorus is near-perfect. It's a good scream, and I recommend listening to the song just for that. The Great Divide - Another awesome intro, but it's too short. Different vocal style, but it's not bad. I like how Ben can do a variety of styles. This song also has the best lyrics on the album. Not some of the best, the best. It reminds me of some Christian rock where the singer is ambiguously talking to a friend, or a lover, or God. It really all depends on your interpretation which makes this one of my favorites on the album. Ashes of Eden - This is the ""wow"" moment of the album. One of my favorite bands is Chevelle, and they often put a ballad or two on each of their albums. This is Breaking Benjamin's ""Chevelle ballad"". And it's really, really good. I'm trying to be informative here but this is really something you just have to listen to, especially if you're a long-time fan of this band. It's a beautiful, inspiring song. The closest I can relate it to an existing Breaking Benjamin song would be ""Without You"" or ""Rain"". Defeated - This was my favorite of the singles and might just be the best song on the album. It's awesome in just about every category. Guitar, drum, vocals, lyrics... it's almost a perfect ""Breaking Benjamin"" song. It just encapsulates all of their styles, their message, so well... I'm honestly blown away whenever I listen to this song. If you don't buy the whole album, buy either this song or ""Ashes of Eden"". It's not the ""wow"" moment but it's the most rocking song here. If you're a casual fan or like Breaking Benjamin just for ""Blow Me Away"" you'll also love this song. Dawn - Somebody else here mentioned that the heartbeat in the song is Ben's baby? That's incredible. The song itself is just okay, (it's an instrumental outro) unfortunately easily outshined by Phobia's stellar outro. But it is an important song in wrapping up the album and with the bit of symbolism it provides. People die, and people are born. These things are not opposites but go hand-in-hand. Life, like all things beautiful, too shall pass.   TL;DR: This album has some of BB's best and some of their worst. I strongly recommend you buy it as it has the greatest diversity of any album they've ever put out. I have already pre-ordered and was glad I got to stream it now, I don't regret my purchase."

BreakingBenjamin,3a082t,ToffeeKing,2,Tue Jun 16 07:41:50 2015 UTC,"This album is a fucking work of art! I'm on my 5th or 6th time through right now, here's my first thoughts:   Ben absolutely KILLS the vocals (My wish was granted, screaming/harsh vocals FTW!)  The drums are SOOOO on point in every song! They effectively add an extra element to every song, whether it be hard as fuck like on Bury Me Alive, or just the right amount of soft on Ashes of Eden.  I thoroughly enjoyed the bass and guitar riffs when they're given the opportunity to shine.  I feel like this is the band that Ben has been working to build since '88. This album was art! It took me on such an emotional journey. It sounds completely new and refined, yet it unquestionably sounds like BB on every track. EASILY my new favorite BB album, HANDS DOWN!   I truly wish all the other bands I like would have taken this route. But I guess there's a reason why BB has always been my favorite ;)"

BreakingBenjamin,3a0lqv,HailWolf,8,Tue Jun 16 08:03:03 2015 UTC,"To me, this is probably the best song Ben has ever made."
BreakingBenjamin,3a0lqv,ToffeeKing,4,Tue Jun 16 17:44:20 2015 UTC,"Oh my God. As soon as I heard Ben's voice I welled up with tears. This is magnificent. Kudos to them, this song is gonna go down in history as one of, if not the, best song they've created."
BreakingBenjamin,3a0lqv,zeldahuman,3,Wed Jun 17 20:37:53 2015 UTC,Favorite song on the album! So much emotion in his voice during the chorus.
BreakingBenjamin,3a0lqv,Magikarpe_Diem_,3,Wed Jun 17 02:11:10 2015 UTC,Incredible song.  You can hear the honesty in Ben's voice.  Probably my favorite so far.

BreakingBenjamin,3a0lqv,QuantumVexation,2,Tue Jun 16 20:48:59 2015 UTC,This song.... It's.... It's.... Beautiful
BreakingBenjamin,3a0lqv,tamu_phobiA,2,Wed Jun 17 10:16:43 2015 UTC,I think this song will go down as one of their best. This definitely appeals to more than just the rock genre.

BreakingBenjamin,3a0gr0,HailWolf,3,Tue Jun 16 06:56:19 2015 UTC,This song is amazing

BreakingBenjamin,3a0gr0,A_Zombie_Riot,3,Tue Jun 16 18:41:11 2015 UTC,"I have no idea. It starts with ""Wake up!"" We'll find out when Aaron tells us."
BreakingBenjamin,3a0gr0,iamkazlan,2,Tue Jun 16 19:51:34 2015 UTC,"I was pretty sure the line goes ""I feel no fault for the FAULT I feel."""
BreakingBenjamin,3a0gr0,roadkillyarn,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:38:07 2015 UTC,"I really like how noticeable backing vocals are now. Like, you can tell (and no offense to Ben) when Keith or even Aaron are prevalent in the background, because I've never heard Ben hit some of those notes before"
BreakingBenjamin,3a0gr0,DPick02,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:57:53 2015 UTC,I keep playing this one on repeat.  I think I've got a favorite from this new album.
BreakingBenjamin,3a0jpx,HailWolf,3,Tue Jun 16 07:34:35 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite that wasn't previously leaked.  Others include bury me alive, ashes  of eden, and oh, wait....the whole album.  Seriously though, I'm not sure the issue with this one that most people have.  Maybe I'm just a sucker for the ballady genericy songs."
BreakingBenjamin,3a0jpx,alahio,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:12:38 2015 UTC,"For some reason this song is really cute to me. Like, I don't understand why. It's probably the weakest song on the album, but there's something about the lyrics and the positivity in the choruses that makes me really pleased with it."
BreakingBenjamin,3a0jpx,iamkazlan,2,Wed Jun 17 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree, haha. :D"
BreakingBenjamin,3a0jpx,zeldahuman,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:39:38 2015 UTC,"Worst song on the CD? Whatever. One of the best, actually."
BreakingBenjamin,3a0jpx,jalexander86,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:00:07 2015 UTC,"I said 'weak', not 'worst'. There is a difference. The composition is sloppy, the lyrics are the most generic on the album, and there's not really anything special about the song at all. So I consider it to be a very weak song.   On the other hand, there's something about the change in mood between the verse and the chorus - especially with the added second half of the chorus - that makes the song feel really triumphant, and so I really enjoy the song. I certainly don't consider it one of the best, but that all ends up being a matter of opinion."
BreakingBenjamin,3a0jpx,iamkazlan,0,Tue Jul 21 07:43:18 2015 UTC,"I'll have to give this one another listen, but I'd say it's my least favorite on the album. There always has to be one of those after all ;)"
BreakingBenjamin,3a0hsp,HailWolf,2,Tue Jun 16 07:09:16 2015 UTC,"This song is so beautifully melodic and sad at the same time, the verses are so eerie."
BreakingBenjamin,3a0hsp,fezzo,2,Wed Jun 17 06:41:05 2015 UTC,"It sounds like ""As you drag me down again"" to me. :o"

BreakingBenjamin,3a0hsp,rhcp88,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:14:18 2015 UTC,Nice.  I really like this song.  Short but sweet little solo too.
BreakingBenjamin,3a0hsp,ToffeeKing,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:14:17 2015 UTC,"I like this song more each time I hear it. The amazing thing about Ben's songs is that you can always find at least one that you relate to on an even deeper level than the rest. Besides, that chorus is spectacular."
BreakingBenjamin,3a0hsp,DeanCutty,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:53:11 2015 UTC,"The bridge has a pitch gate, so the guitar's digitally dip and warp. Sounds awesome, and it's another new sound not yet heard in a BB album."
BreakingBenjamin,3a0idn,HailWolf,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:16:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't like this song at all the first time I streamed the album, and was quickly forgotten since it's followed by Bury Me Alive. But after about 6 or 7 listens it's grown on me alot! I love how it builds and the melody get's easily stuck in my head."
BreakingBenjamin,3a0idn,_Wolverine007_,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:01:49 2015 UTC,I don't get the dislike of this song.  I think it's great.
BreakingBenjamin,3a0idn,rhcp88,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:17:32 2015 UTC,"First favourite from the album. It's so good! Also, I kind of love the way Ben enunciates the words in the chorus. ""I'll keep love togetherrrrrrrr, and I'll be yours forevrrrrrr!"" haha."
BreakingBenjamin,3a0kd7,HailWolf,2,Tue Jun 16 07:43:33 2015 UTC,That intro lol.
BreakingBenjamin,3a0kd7,CraziBoi94,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:51:28 2015 UTC,"I would say this song is not about Ben, but about someone close to him that perhaps was one of those ""I'm praying for you"" people."
BreakingBenjamin,3a0kd7,tamu_phobiA,2,Wed Jun 17 14:16:38 2015 UTC,"Considering how many times Breaking Benjamin lyrics reference prayers (and the fact that I can remember an interview with Ben and Chad where he said he was either Christian or agnostic), I don't think this is the case. Regardless, you can pray without praying to a specific deity."
BreakingBenjamin,3a0iym,HailWolf,2,Tue Jun 16 07:24:35 2015 UTC,"I think the second line is: I was drained and left behind.  And the other line you didn't know sounds like: All will change and calcify (maybe? after a second listen, I might have a better idea.)"
BreakingBenjamin,3a0iym,birtney,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:18:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I caught drained and am listening again.   Edit: Yup! Sounds like calcify."

BreakingBenjamin,39yk04,deogot2b,3,Mon Jun 15 23:00:52 2015 UTC,Listen to Breaking the Silence. Pretty intense song.
BreakingBenjamin,39yk04,Phobiass,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:47:59 2015 UTC,I think Ben has a harder time growling now days. Probably N effect to his drinking and smoking. I liked those songs to they were a nice change of pace but I think those times are gone.

BreakingBenjamin,39c1em,RedStag86,4,Wed Jun 10 20:12:10 2015 UTC,Awesome song to play on guitar.
BreakingBenjamin,39c1em,fezzo,3,Thu Jun 11 04:30:41 2015 UTC,I own all of Breaking Benjamin's albums (besides the new one) and know every song by heart. I can't think of any better opening song for a concert than this one. I can imagine the lights going crazy at https://youtu.be/60IDOguUqPI?t=2m38s
BreakingBenjamin,39c1em,Surelythisisntaclone,4,Thu Jun 11 01:27:45 2015 UTC,The first three of their concerts I went to in 2006-2007 they opened with this song. The best.
BreakingBenjamin,39c1em,bmohler2014,3,Sun Jun 14 05:17:00 2015 UTC,The riff at 2:57 is super fun; both to play and listen to. It's ridiculous how often I forget how good this album is.
BreakingBenjamin,38v01l,MA0801,3,Sun Jun 7 01:38:14 2015 UTC,"I like it, but I give it to the performance edge to the acoustic he did a few years back at the House of Blues: http://youtu.be/YR8ADQcDQho"
BreakingBenjamin,38v01l,AdrianHD,2,Sun Jun 7 12:18:19 2015 UTC,Yeah I loved that whole set list at House of Blues. Especially in Time after Time when he belts out 'I will be waiting!' In the second part of the chorus.
BreakingBenjamin,38v01l,_Wolverine007_,2,Sun Jun 7 12:20:19 2015 UTC,It's an acoustic cover of Queens 'Who Wants to Live Forever'.
BreakingBenjamin,38t1oi,skyclerk,12,Sat Jun 6 15:58:00 2015 UTC,Anything on Saturate is insanely underrated and underplayed by casual fans. It's their best album in my opinion.

BreakingBenjamin,38t1oi,Infinit777,2,Sat Jun 6 19:26:54 2015 UTC,"I've loved every song they've released, so ordering albums isn't really best to worst, it's best to least best.

BreakingBenjamin,386zp5,BasedRayce,10,Tue Jun 2 08:25:54 2015 UTC,"I think a return from a big break like this is going to be divisive amongst the listener base. As someone who literally grew up listening, having found We Are Not Alone when I was 10, I feel like this story is a shared thread amongst the whole listener base; everybody has a super old horse in this race. The difference is going to come down to personal opinion; there will be those who listen to the music and say ""This is different, I really like their old stuff for A, B, and C reason,"" and those who say ""This is a refreshing difference for X, Y, and Z reason, I like it.""  You're not the only person who doesn't find anything exceptional in the new music, so don't feel like you're alone. The vocality of each opinion is going to vary, but I definitely sense two different camps in relation to the new music.  Personally, I look at the new songs through a lens of a 6-year gap between fresh albums being, by nature, a changing experience. I never thought that this new album was going to be a spin backwards on the clock, what with new musicians and years of life experience for Ben. It's the same way that I'll never be the same person I was in high school because I've grown and matured and developed different tastes and opinions, I think 6 years away has created a different BB and I'm okay with that. The new songs themselves, too, happen to fall in line with the type of music aesthetic I really like, even a bit more than some of the older songs. It's all about personal taste, since there is no all-encompassing standard of what is ""beautiful"" or ""ugly"" in art."
BreakingBenjamin,386zp5,karhall,3,Tue Jun 2 11:42:57 2015 UTC,"Very well put, my theory has been that these 3 were chosen by the record company to be released as they are very basic and true to the BB style, at least to the last album and hopefully there are some hidden gems on there. I do like the new music, but that is about it."
BreakingBenjamin,386zp5,tarantula_eater,2,Tue Jun 2 18:16:56 2015 UTC,"I definitely think there will be some hidden gems on the album. There's only one rock station where I live, and pretty much the only BB songs that it played until Failure came out were Diary of Jane, Polyamorous, and Breath. It wasn't until I started hearing other stuff on Pandora that I realized how much I was missing by the limited selection that's played on the radio. If I had known that Water, Home, and Shallow Bay existed in 2002, I would've been the dedicated fan that I am now from the start.  It seems like a lot of their songs that get released as singles are not necessarily the BEST songs."
BreakingBenjamin,386zp5,HiIaryDuff,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:04:06 2015 UTC,"I agree, I hope you're right."
BreakingBenjamin,386zp5,Infinit777,7,Thu Jun 11 06:19:06 2015 UTC,"They've always followed a formula and have their own distinct sound, there's only so much variation you can get. I do appreciate however the positivity in all of their new songs released so far, which is refreshing, as opposed to the usual 'woe is me' lyrical style."
BreakingBenjamin,386zp5,Hamlet7768,4,Tue Jun 2 09:44:04 2015 UTC,"I think they sound great, I say we should wait until the full album is out before making a noise about if the new songs/lyrics do not meet previous album standards.  (been a fan since Saturate, can't say i have a favorite album since they are all god-tier to me)"
BreakingBenjamin,386zp5,CanBeUsedAnywhere,3,Tue Jun 2 20:10:47 2015 UTC,The only problem I have with the new songs (and I've said it before) is that the production feels thin. I feel like the guitars on Phobia and Dear Agony sounded so much bigger than on these tracks.
BreakingBenjamin,386zp5,echojester,2,Thu Jun 4 14:34:37 2015 UTC,"The reason the production on the new music sounds so thin compared to Phobia and Dear Agony is because Ben is producing it himself. Where the aforementioned albums (as well as We are not alone) were produced David Bendeth. They spent a lot of money on Phobia, or rather it is likely that the record company did, WANA was Bendeth's first time with them and seemed to keep it closer to Saturate. My favorite quote about Phobia is ""They have spent countless of dollars on the new album ""Phobia"" which sounds like an independent band would afford to record the intro of 1:13 before their money was gone."" It does sound amazing. That said, it also tends to give the album a standardize feel. This in my opinion was a lot more prevalent in Dear Agony, as only a few songs ever sounded unique. The new songs sound like they should have been on Dear Agony, and that Ben was trying to emulate the production on them, but is just not up to par with Bendeth when it comes to producing. This is not a knock on Ben, as some under produced music might do wonders."
BreakingBenjamin,386zp5,time_drifter,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:01:10 2015 UTC,"Ben wrote most of it solo so I guess without the added influence of other band members the production is kinda one-dimensional, if that makes sense. I know when Keith/Jasen/Aaron came in they tried to add some touches but with the songs being 90% written how much of a change could they make? I'm curious to find out what kind of sound the second album will have with this line up. Assuming there is a second album and all that."
BreakingBenjamin,386zp5,XxShrimpTacoxX,2,Tue Jun 9 15:55:48 2015 UTC,"It seems like the album is a bit of a departure from the norm, but as others have said, this is a rebirth of sorts.    I personally like what I hear but I can understand people thinking otherwise.  One thing I do like about it is that the songs have a much wider range between them.  The tempo and sounds hit both ends of the spectrum when traditionally they tend to sound the same."
BreakingBenjamin,386zp5,XxShrimpTacoxX,2,Thu Jun 4 19:39:35 2015 UTC,lets be honest the lyrics have never been great
BreakingBenjamin,386zp5,mikeo490,3,Sun Jun 7 19:44:20 2015 UTC,"I have to strongly disagree, maybe the top songs from Dear Agony weren't great but Phobia and Saturate are great albums."
BreakingBenjamin,386zp5,jalexander86,3,Sun Jun 7 22:49:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if anything saturate has the most bearable ones but some of the others just feel like a bunch of depressing words thrown in together, they don't really hold a main idea for the song, it's just kind of there."
BreakingBenjamin,386zp5,rhcp88,2,Mon Jun 8 03:35:05 2015 UTC,"This.   It just feels so tacky at this point.  If he mentions ""giving up"",  ""giving in"", or  lonely roads.. I'll be disappointed"
BreakingBenjamin,386zp5,Symtex123,2,Mon Jun 8 04:37:48 2015 UTC,"We Are Not Alone as well.  The problem with these 3 songs is that there isn't much to the lyrics, not that they are necessarily bad."
BreakingBenjamin,386zp5,Phobiass,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:40:15 2015 UTC,"I think the songs are awesome so far.  Then again, Dear Agony is my favorite BB album, so I'm probably a bit biased towards these types of songs."

BreakingBenjamin,386zp5,iamkazlan,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:20:49 2015 UTC,"I felt the same about defeated, but after listening to it it a lot I've grown a connection to it and love it. Has a lot more positive message than in use to from BB."
BreakingBenjamin,386zp5,Symtex123,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:23:32 2015 UTC,"You are not alone. I've been an fan of Breaking Benjamin since they were touring in support of Saturate, and I don't feel like they have a bad song. With that said, I agree that the three songs from the new album have been good but not great. The lyrics seem a little more cliche or generic than I am used to from BB and the songs feel like b-sides to me. I've already pre-ordered the album and will continue to support the band and go to shows, but I don't have the same enthusiasm that I had when the album was first announced."

The mixing was bad and the botched lip syncing made it even worse. I just don't think Ben is easily covered. I watched your other videos and I like your lower register better.  The first verse of the Hozier song was great, but the hook was awful. The Simple Man cover was the best of the four.   If you are going to make a video that looks like live recording, I think you need to do a better job of acting like you're really singing.   I hope you take this as constructive criticism and not jerk-face-ness."

BreakingBenjamin,36wxxj,McIgglyTuffMuffin,5,Fri May 22 20:15:42 2015 UTC,"I was fortunate enough to see them at Rock on the Range right up near the barrier in front of the stage, they put on a stellar performance. Some of the songs obviously sound 3DG-ish, but some of them were definitely more fresh sounding and a bit outside of what we've heard Adam do until now. I think having Mike Mushok on guitar was a great choice because that guy can bust out some killer leads and solos and of course Adam and the rest of the band all sounded great. They were very tight as a band for their first show and Adam really brought a lot of energy. Just based on the few original songs they played, I think their debut is going to be one of the rock records of the year."
BreakingBenjamin,36v5a8,_Wolverine007_,2,Fri May 22 11:13:09 2015 UTC,It was pretty rockin! The new band is rockin. There was so much energy. You could tell Ben really was glad to be back.

BreakingBenjamin,36bg7t,McIgglyTuffMuffin,2,Mon May 18 18:50:20 2015 UTC,This recording would be so much better if it was properly mixed. The drum levels are way too loud. Ben's vocals sounds muffled and I can barely hear Aaron's bass over the guitars. It's a shame considering the actual audio quality sounds pretty good otherwise.

BreakingBenjamin,369bkt,mynameispenis,8,Sun May 17 13:00:34 2015 UTC,"I ended up doing a bit of reading...  There's apparently a rift between PRS and Ben right now. Someone tried to poke him about it, but he couldn't get into details. He says he switched to ESP in a Q&A, but I'm not sure if he's endorsed or is just using some he bought himself.   http://prsguitars.com/forum/showthread.php?10492-Ben-Burnley-%28Breaking-Benjamin%29-Custom-PRR-HB-s&p=202273&viewfull=1#post202273  Something similar happened to Pete Loeffler from Chevelle. They also discontinued the Mushok baritone, as well as the Opeth sig models. They seem to be ditching several old-time endorsees, but are gaining some new ones (Mark from Periphery, Dustie from BTBAM). I guess they're trying to get more interest in the prog metal market now?  So in the meantime, it seems he and Jasen are using LTD and have ditched PRS, while Keith is still trying to stay with them.   It does suck, since Ben and Pete were huge reasons why I wanted PRS. I still kinda want them still, since they're fantastic instruments.  QUICKIE EDIT: Maybe he had a signature model in the works? Reading a bit, it seems Pete left because he was developing a signature model, but PRS told them no and developed signature models for 2 endorsees that only used PRS for a very, very short time (the two mentioned above). If you were like Pete and Ben and have been using PRS for over a decade, yeah, I'd bail too...  Edit 2: Also, It's kinda interesting to note that Jasen's drop C guitar is possibly a discontinued LTD EC-400AT. At least thats what it seems like."
BreakingBenjamin,369bkt,hehasthejazzhands,5,Sun May 17 21:28:49 2015 UTC,"I posted this earlier in the week on one of the other threads where the conversation of his guitars came up:  Two things came to mind:  1) I know that the addition of Keith and Jasen allows him to play a simpler role in terms of guitars, so maybe he was more comfortable/thought it sounded better using a different set of guitars for his new role. 2) (and probably more likely) Ben was a sponsored artist for PRS years ago and those artists are on contract with the vendors. I'm wondering if the 5-6 year layoff caused his PRS contract to expire. If I'm on the PRS marketing team I don't think I would resign someone who's on hiatus (and at times there was heavy uncertainty of him ever returning to the business). There may have also been a clause in his original contract that stated if the contract voided he would not be able to play PRS guitars in public appearances without a new contract. I believe the ESP, LTD, and Gibson are his personal guitars."
BreakingBenjamin,369bkt,echojester,4,Sun May 17 16:47:13 2015 UTC,"You raise good points, but what of his two custom baritones, with the BB inlays, it's all rather curious. Who knows, he could've just retired them."
BreakingBenjamin,369bkt,Maccadude33,3,Sun May 17 23:56:57 2015 UTC,"He probably still has them but has simply retired them from public use, as you said. See here and here. I'd bet he tracked parts of the new songs using at least one of them, so the fact he isn't playing them on stage anymore certainly suggests something is up between him and PRS.  It's a shame they never released a Ben Burnley artist model to the public. Boy I would have loved to buy one."

He was even seen using a hollowbody Singlecut, and he never used Singlecuts before. I'm guessing he was trying to get a new contract with PRS, but I guess it was just an unsignable contract. I guess it's contract-related since he's so hush-hush about it.  Hey, if this means that we get a singlecut hollowbody LTD Eclipse in the future, I'm all for it."
BreakingBenjamin,369bkt,Maccadude33,1 point,Tue May 19 03:59:42 2015 UTC,"I've never been a fan of the PRS sound, but I always liked the tone BB, Red, Staind, and Chevelle could get out of their PRS instruments. The fact a bunch of the guitarists I liked have parted or are parting ways with them after endorsing them for so long is disappointing. I have a hard time believing they would abandon some of their favorite guitars over a few dollars, so to speak, but it is what it is.  Personally I've never been a fan of ESP/LTD instruments. If they work for Ben, great! They're just not my cup of tea. If they gave him a signature model, it'd have to be pretty damn good for me to consider buying one."

BreakingBenjamin,35opt5,sf1215,6,Tue May 12 10:49:54 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, it absolutely grows on you. I was one of the few that was able to get this song when the iTunes UK leak happened. It was my least favorite of the 3 then, but now they're all amazing in their own right."
BreakingBenjamin,35opt5,roadkillyarn,5,Tue May 12 15:07:59 2015 UTC,I love this sub so much right now.
BreakingBenjamin,35opt5,Ravenfall7,2,Tue May 12 13:02:49 2015 UTC,Ugh! I'm having trouble waiting 7 more days until this show. Come on already!
BreakingBenjamin,35opt5,RedStag86,5,Tue May 12 13:29:29 2015 UTC,"Tbh the whole ""the pain goes on, we all fall down"" thing makes it worse than it could've been. Other than that I like it. Really heavy, which is my favorite BB"
BreakingBenjamin,35opt5,That-1-White-Guy,2,Tue May 12 13:48:55 2015 UTC,"It's kind of an echo of Without You, isn't it? ""I lost myself, we all fall down."" Falling and rising again is a recurring theme with Ben. ""As I fight for one last prayer."" Fantastic."

BreakingBenjamin,35p89p,Baselt95,8,Tue May 12 11:41:28 2015 UTC,Angels fall is my favorite but it's hard to say any song is better. Depends on the day and mood I guess
BreakingBenjamin,35p89p,Myredditaccount33,6,Tue May 12 12:48:40 2015 UTC,Great song. Failure is probably still my favorite of the three.
BreakingBenjamin,35p89p,HappyGilOHMYGOD,4,Tue May 12 12:25:08 2015 UTC,"It's certainly ""grittier"" than their other songs. The rhythms are choppier in ""Defeated"" than in ""Angels Fall"" and ""Failure"". I could easily see this song making its way into movie trailers (specifically the chorus) or video games.   Angel's Fall is still my favorite, it's very smooth I think."
BreakingBenjamin,35p89p,echojester,4,Tue May 12 12:51:50 2015 UTC,"It's got a very strong Phobia feel to it in the beginning, maybe even WANA, then sort of transitions to what I'm going to call sort of a new sound (probably most similar to DA).  Overall, I like it. I like it a lot."
BreakingBenjamin,35p89p,wingzfan99,3,Tue May 12 20:58:29 2015 UTC,"Love it!   By the way, this is how I'd rank the new songs: Failure > Defeated > Angels Fall, even though all are awesome."
BreakingBenjamin,35p89p,Negative47,3,Tue May 12 13:39:20 2015 UTC,"It's got the catchiest hook to me. The ""no love to believe in"" part got stuck in my head really easy.     I think this one will grow to be my favorite over time."
BreakingBenjamin,35p89p,Pinkman2012,3,Tue May 12 15:39:21 2015 UTC,This one has been my favorite overall.
BreakingBenjamin,35p89p,iN00B94,3,Tue May 12 23:40:02 2015 UTC,Absolutely love it.  I think this album might even top Dear Agony for me if it's as good as these singles are.  So stoked.
BreakingBenjamin,35p89p,rhcp88,2,Wed May 13 01:09:49 2015 UTC,"I totally love this track! I dig what Shaun Foist did with the drum part, it gave it a heavier feel despite the softer vocals, especially in the chorus.  I like a Failure a tad more ONLY because it has so much of a classic BB sound to it, but this track falls easily in second place.  I feel guilty because even though I know what Ben has gone through with his throat, I'm DYING to hear some more screaming/harshness in the vocals. I know, I know - I'm terrible, but I feel like it's the missing ingredient in what would otherwise be a great song. It would only make it THAT much better!"
BreakingBenjamin,35p89p,_Wolverine007_,2,Wed May 13 19:15:51 2015 UTC,"I really like Defeated. One of the things I really loved about most of the songs on Dear Agony was that if you pulled your headphones out a bit, you could hear Ben harmonizing with himself (mainly in the verses).   I was looking for that in Failure and Angels Fall, but I didn't hear it. But I hear it in Defeated! It's my new favourite for now, haha."
BreakingBenjamin,35p89p,hollow-heroes,2,Fri May 15 09:13:11 2015 UTC,"So far I've enjoyed Defeated more than Failure, more than Angels Fall. Granted,  I really love the harsher BB sounds. Especially because I already consider BB a soft rock to be listening too.  Overall, Defeated just punches in a different way and keeps pushing a tempo that is slightly off-kilter.   I'm still waiting for a straight up hard song though."
BreakingBenjamin,35p89p,AdrianHD,1 point,Wed May 13 01:56:02 2015 UTC,"I enjoy it, as the others. It definitely feels a little older, kinda instrumentally We Are Not Alone-ish with the echoey vocals that Phobia had.  I think Failure is still my favorite due to that ending that threw me off guard. I'll need to sizzle Defeated some more before Angels Fall. I've been on a heavy hip hop kick recently and haven't really given Angels Fall as big of a chance as Failure."
BreakingBenjamin,35p89p,Unicorn_Pie,1 point,Wed May 13 08:09:26 2015 UTC,is it me or does the mixing sound slightly off? still loving fresh BB nevertheless.
BreakingBenjamin,35p89p,Hamlet7768,1 point,Wed May 13 02:42:07 2015 UTC,"The mixing on all of these new singles has been a bit off in my opinion. The guitars sound a bit scooped, as well as the bass, which leaves this giant hole in the mix. That's my only real quibble with this new material; musically it's fantastic."
BreakingBenjamin,35p7kx,Myredditaccount33,2,Tue May 12 11:32:57 2015 UTC,I'll be seeing them on the 23 I want no spoilers lol
BreakingBenjamin,35k11e,Tamparockout17,2,Mon May 11 02:51:23 2015 UTC,"Kinda on-topic, but I noticed he hasn't been playing his PRSes recently. He's been playing ESP, LTD, and his old Gibson baritone. Something happened between him and Paul?"
BreakingBenjamin,35k11e,hehasthejazzhands,1 point,Mon May 11 19:40:15 2015 UTC,"Yea I was disappointed his PRS Baritone wasn't there, when I first saw it in I will not bow music video I fell in love.  No idea why, maybe he uses it for studio and not touring?"
BreakingBenjamin,35k11e,hehasthejazzhands,1 point,Mon May 11 19:59:38 2015 UTC,"He was using it before live, ever since he got it in 2006. He even had a backup or two, as well as a slew of custom/off-the-shelf PRSi. Now he's using Asian-made LTD EC-1000s and his Gibson Les Paul Studio baritone (which was solely a studio guitar), which are for-sure drops in quality compared to his custom-shop, Maryland-made PRSi.  He wouldn't be the first to mysteriously bail from them. Pete from Chevelle was a big-time PRS user and, like Ben, had a ton of custom PRS baritones and Custom 24s. Ever since their recent album, he's strictly used Fender Strats and stopped using his PRSi.  It's a shame, really. Ben and Pete were the big reasons why I wanted a PRS Custom 22 and Mushok baritone."
BreakingBenjamin,35k11e,hehasthejazzhands,1 point,Mon May 11 21:04:03 2015 UTC,"That's weird, I'm just wondering if it had anything to do with the separation of Ben from the rest of the band in 08."
BreakingBenjamin,35k11e,Hamlet7768,1 point,Mon May 11 21:22:36 2015 UTC,"It could be, but he was still using them up until the February 14th Rochester show. The April 17th show was the first show I've seen him without a PRS since like 2001?   Anyways, sorry for the derail. The picture is awesome. Fucking awesome to see Ben so into it again. :D"
BreakingBenjamin,35k11e,echojester,1 point,Mon May 11 23:30:29 2015 UTC,"It was a good show, but I'm from Tampa, and this show was in Ft Meyers.  Their Tampa show was the night before and I had bought my tickets before they announced the Tampa show. I was disappointed at the crowd. Compared to Tampa, they were boring."
BreakingBenjamin,35k11e,hehasthejazzhands,1 point,Mon May 11 23:55:29 2015 UTC,"I read in an old interview with Aaron Fink that he owned most of the guitars the band used at the time, which included Ben's PRS...though that raises the question of how Ben had it in the teaser video."

My musical tastes are all over the place, but these lyrics, while not amazingly profound or mind-bending, still hit home for me.

When I went to see them a few months back I went out back to their bus and there was a large gathering of fans headed that way already, and they stayed out there for well over an hour to sign stuff and take pictures with everyone. It seems to me that maybe there was some miscommunication or other factors at play in this case."
BreakingBenjamin,34rs5p,DanTheMan_622,1 point,Mon May 4 16:42:48 2015 UTC,"That's what I would like to think happened but I don't know. It doesn't make sense to be on a hiatus for 6+ years, go on tour and about to release an album to just snub fans like that."
BreakingBenjamin,34rs5p,DanTheMan_622,5,Mon May 4 17:48:33 2015 UTC,"Well, looks like i've got some good news. Their schedule for the day was messed up because of some behind the scenes stuff not running completely as they should have, which caused them to have to change their schedule around to accommodate all of their commitments (interviews, signings, etc.), which led to a shortened signing period. It was an unfortunate situation, but hopefully that explanation makes you feel a bit better."

I don't know how to explain it or what it sounds like, but when you recognize the same melodic vocal slide in each song, going either higher or lower pitched, you'll constantly be noticing it.  EDIT: One example is in ""Crawl"" when he says ""Dilated eyes shine for one last time"", you'll notice on the word time, he slides down three notes. Think ""Ti-i-ime""."

The guy who does the screaming/growling completely ruins some pretty cool guitar riffs and adrenaline driven songs with his terrible deep noises that make me turn off their songs on the downbeat he comes in on. I wish they would get a higher pitched (more treble) screamer like Ben or Chester (of Linkin Park), then they would be pretty good imo.  For example: This song is awesome until 0:40. Then I turn it off. And this is someone who enjoys some screaming in songs. This guy though, man... I can't take it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2nK8Jq-IEI"

BreakingBenjamin,33m8kj,TobyVolo,12,Thu Apr 23 17:43:52 2015 UTC,"There will definitely be a couple of heavier songs. I'd say, like any heavy band on the radio, they're picking the more ""radio friendly"" songs to release first."
BreakingBenjamin,33m8kj,DanTheMan_622,2,Thu Apr 23 19:11:03 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. Bands are a business and they need to make the moves that ultimately will boost album sales and increase their exposure. Some of their most successful songs were the radio friendly ones (DOJ, So Cold, Breath, etc). Us true fans have been here the whole time, but I am sure there is a good chunk of people who disappeared when the band went on hiatus and they realize they need to get that casual fan back. Releasing these 3 in particular is a perfect plan of attack IMO."
BreakingBenjamin,33m8kj,echojester,4,Tue May 12 22:53:34 2015 UTC,So far it sounds a lot like Dear Agony which I would be super happy about because that's my favorite BB album.  I guess we'll see though.
BreakingBenjamin,33m8kj,rhcp88,7,Thu Apr 23 17:45:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, dont get me wrong. After this long of a hiatus, i will be happy with whatever he puts out (as always).  In the end its still new BB music."
BreakingBenjamin,33m8kj,rhcp88,3,Thu Apr 23 17:48:11 2015 UTC,Yeah I do think a couple of heavier songs would balance it out nicely too though.
BreakingBenjamin,33m8kj,Symtex123,2,Thu Apr 23 17:50:54 2015 UTC,"I have similar concerns Toby. I don't think we'll see another Saturate, the new stuff is still good, but its certainly lacking on songs that make me want to 'throw down'."
BreakingBenjamin,33m8kj,timmehfx,4,Thu Apr 23 20:01:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Toby, I'm hoping for some more heavy/angry music as well.  Of course, bands evolve, and I imagine that Benjamin Burnley isn't in the state of mind now that he was when he wrote his earlier albums. If it's anything like Dear Agony, there will still be some angry/heavy songs though. For instance, it had Crawl and Lights Out, which were pretty heavy."
BreakingBenjamin,33m8kj,tamu_phobiA,3,Sun Apr 26 19:01:32 2015 UTC,"If you are looking for a more Saturate/We Are Not Alone feel, you might be disappointed. Ben is sober. His writing style is different because of his sobriety."
BreakingBenjamin,33m8kj,MattTheKatt,0,Thu May 7 00:44:27 2015 UTC,"Unfortunate for us, fortunate for him.  I am guessing he still has his phobias which may still 'haunt' him and inspire him to come with some of his older stuff? We shall see.  I am sure having a family and kids now affects his writing style too."
BreakingBenjamin,33m8kj,Fuck_off_NSA,2,Thu May 7 15:34:03 2015 UTC,I hope some songs sound like their older stuff.
BreakingBenjamin,33m8kj,steelsharkstudios,2,Wed Apr 29 00:13:47 2015 UTC,"Now let me say, I'm not NOT saying Linkin Park is as heavy as BB, but hear me out. Look at LP's album ""The Hunting Party"", arguably their heaviest album yet, and listen to Final Masquerade and Until It's Gone. Both were singles released before the album, and they're both melodic ballad type songs. But then you listen to Keys to the Kingdom, the first track on the album, and it's already heavier than anything they've done in the last 12 years with an acapella distorted scream and guitars and everything. The point is, the singles that come out before and album aren't always representative of what the rest of the songs sound like."
BreakingBenjamin,33m8kj,AdrianHD,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:37:32 2015 UTC,"Very good point. Linkin Park's latest album was a pleasant surprise.   Then again, Guilty All The Same was their first single from that album i believe which was pretty damn heavy."
BreakingBenjamin,33m8kj,steelsharkstudios,5,Thu May 7 15:40:47 2015 UTC,"this is the track list    ""Dark""      2:10  ""Failure""       3:34  ""Angels Fall""       3:48  ""Breaking the Silence""      3:01  ""Hollow""    3:51  ""Close to Heaven""       4:09  ""Bury Me Alive""     4:04  ""Never Again""       3:43  ""The Great Divide""      4:12     ""Ashes of Eden""     4:53     ""Defeated""      3:25     ""Dawn"" none of those names sound super heavy/angry but who knows"
BreakingBenjamin,33m8kj,DeanCutty,11,Fri Apr 24 11:30:54 2015 UTC,"Then again, does Believe sound heavy just by song title?"
BreakingBenjamin,33m8kj,CrucifixD,1 point,Sat Apr 25 15:54:48 2015 UTC,good point
BreakingBenjamin,33m8kj,_Wolverine007_,6,Sat Apr 25 16:59:48 2015 UTC,"Judging from the length of ""Breaking The Silence"", I will guess that that will be a faster, heavy song. Especially with it following Angels Fall. Album flow and such."
BreakingBenjamin,33jw1r,RussianNarwhals,3,Thu Apr 23 02:46:19 2015 UTC,Imperial March - Star Wars   Haha thats awesome I want to hear them do that.
BreakingBenjamin,33jw1r,jalexander86,2,Fri Apr 24 09:15:01 2015 UTC,It was awesome lol
BreakingBenjamin,33jw1r,UnsinkableRubberDuck,2,Sat Apr 25 03:10:28 2015 UTC,Not the best quality but I found it. :D  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FMuRhWy838
BreakingBenjamin,33hy9j,jalexander86,3,Wed Apr 22 17:46:19 2015 UTC,Failure was the only new song they performed. They also performed a cover of Smells Like Teen Spirit which was amazing.
BreakingBenjamin,33hy9j,RedStag86,2,Wed Apr 22 17:47:47 2015 UTC,"I'm seeing them May 19th and honestly, I'm going for the old stuff. Play me some Firefly, Phase, and Water please! Failure? Sure. But I'm not sure I want to hear a bunch of stuff I've never heard before. And check the covers at the door."
BreakingBenjamin,33hy9j,Infinit777,2,Thu Apr 23 00:28:46 2015 UTC,"Me and my best friend were hoping for Firefly but no dice. Phase and Water are also amazing songs. But sadly were also not played. Polyamorous should be on the Playlist for the show you are going to as well as Shallow Bay but that will probably be it as far as anything from Saturate goes.  Medicate, Natural Life, Skin, Next To Nothing, Home... man I could keep going on with the awesome songs from that CD. I would have been happy if the whole concert was just a live rendition of that album track by track. But I realize the bulk of the fan base was gained with the latter two albums so most of the show consisted of that stuff.  Suprisingly Ben himself feels the same way we do, though. Before he played Polyamorous he told everyone if they have never heard Saturate to grab the CD because it is a work of art. He went on to describe the album cover so everyone could find it. So he himself prefers that old musical style but the money is in the new stuff sadly."
BreakingBenjamin,33hy9j,Infinit777,4,Thu Apr 23 00:47:00 2015 UTC,Congrats :) I am going to be seeing them soon as well finally. Ive been waiting since Saturate to see them live!  28 days left...
BreakingBenjamin,33hy9j,Infinit777,3,Wed Apr 22 19:55:13 2015 UTC,Thank you! You will have a blast. Same here on Saturate. Heard Skin on the radio at 14 years old and became an instant fan. Ben may not have agreed with making Skin the first single off Saturate but it was a good radio song for the time.
BreakingBenjamin,33hy9j,Fireman2085,3,Wed Apr 22 19:57:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks , i am sure i will :P  Skin was such a good song for the radio though:p always gets me pumped when i hear it!  2 Quick questions: Did Ben and the band come out for autographs after the show? and how were the merch prices?"
BreakingBenjamin,33hy9j,Fireman2085,3,Wed Apr 22 20:12:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know on the autographs. We took off after the show. Was just exhausted. They have shirts for $30, arm bands for $10 and I think they had hats but don't quote me on that and I don't remember a price.  Edit: I know without a doubt the openers, the Young Guns, did post show autographs. They were great as well."
BreakingBenjamin,33hy9j,Jesses72390,3,Wed Apr 22 20:14:30 2015 UTC,awesome :) Thanks for the info!
BreakingBenjamin,33btws,arielmayer,4,Tue Apr 21 06:29:07 2015 UTC,I love this video. And I don't even know the anthem.
BreakingBenjamin,33btws,DPick02,3,Tue Apr 21 15:44:33 2015 UTC,I just wish he'd ripped open a scream on brrraAAAAAVVVVEEEE at the end.  I would have lost my shit if I'd been in the crowd and he did that.
BreakingBenjamin,334l2e,wiwom1,10,Sun Apr 19 14:15:31 2015 UTC,"Saturate is me personal favorite, I love heavier feel to it, with We Are Not Alone my second. I feel like those albums don't get enough recognition."
BreakingBenjamin,334l2e,cozmcjewshzombe,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:50:48 2015 UTC,Same here. That album was heavier and will always stand out among the other albums.  I really hope there are some really have songs on his new album.
BreakingBenjamin,334l2e,TobyVolo,3,Thu Apr 23 17:44:57 2015 UTC,I know alot of people liked it but Im really just hoping for something really different fron Dear Agony.
BreakingBenjamin,334l2e,cozmcjewshzombe,8,Thu Apr 23 18:58:15 2015 UTC,Phobia.
BreakingBenjamin,334l2e,PSI_Rockin_Omega,6,Sun Apr 19 17:26:41 2015 UTC,"I love Dear Agony and We Are Not Alone, but Phobia really takes the cake for me. Can't exactly say why as all their albums have amazing songs on them, but Phobia really resonates with me. It's been in my car for a few months now and every once in a while I just put it on repeat but never get tired of it."
BreakingBenjamin,334l2e,DanTheMan_622,2,Sun Apr 19 16:28:07 2015 UTC,Phobia is still the one I rock most.
BreakingBenjamin,334l2e,DanTheMan_622,2,Sun Apr 19 16:39:40 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling that Dark Before Dawn may end up tying with Phobia or even take over as my favourite record. It's already got a very Phobia + Dear Agony-ish feel to it, which in my opinion is a great thing."
BreakingBenjamin,334l2e,DanTheMan_622,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:16:35 2015 UTC,"So far I've found Dark Before Dawn too soft for my personal preferences. I'd even rank Saturate and We Are Not Alone above Dear Agony for myself. Though all albums are good, I just want a darker sound."
BreakingBenjamin,334l2e,DanTheMan_622,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:32:03 2015 UTC,I'm sure we'll get a good range of songs like on the last two records. Have you heard the leak of Defeated yet?
BreakingBenjamin,334l2e,Symtex123,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:54:38 2015 UTC,I have not.
BreakingBenjamin,334l2e,jalexander86,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:33:02 2015 UTC,"If the fact that it's not an official release doesn't bother you then i'd definitely check it out. It may be more along the lines of what you're wanting to hear.  You can listen to it here without having to dowload it, quality is decent."
BreakingBenjamin,334l2e,rhcp88,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:03:36 2015 UTC,"I kept waiting for a scream. Something akin to Shadows from RED is what that made me think of.  Better, just still not quite the heaviness I was so fond of."
BreakingBenjamin,334l2e,steelsharkstudios,4,Mon Apr 20 02:07:34 2015 UTC,"In order of album created is my ranking. I find the newer stuff good, but lacks the energy to get my blood going. I'll still enjoy the new album, but Saturate will always hold a special place in my heart and I'm a little sad that they moved so far away from this style.   Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy BB's newer stuff, just not nearly as much as I enjoyed the earliest albums."
BreakingBenjamin,334l2e,fliper7der,2,Wed Apr 22 18:10:52 2015 UTC,"Exactly how I feel. And ironically Ben feels the same way. Last night in Birmingham he advised everyone that hasn't heard Saturate to grab a copy. Called it a work of art. While the newest stuff has been good nothing can touch the first 2-3 albums, especially Saturate."
BreakingBenjamin,334l2e,The_Cakinator,3,Wed Apr 22 19:21:03 2015 UTC,Yeah Dear Agony is mine.  No filler on that album.  But Phobia comes pretty close too.
BreakingBenjamin,334l2e,brajmoss,3,Sun Apr 19 14:54:18 2015 UTC,"WE are not Alone second would probably be phobia then dear agony then saturate, although i still fucking love saturate"
BreakingBenjamin,334l2e,Synkroniser,2,Sun Apr 19 18:04:36 2015 UTC,Phobia just really lines up to me
BreakingBenjamin,334l2e,TheDonotknowname,2,Sun Apr 19 20:51:25 2015 UTC,Has to be We Are Not Alone for me.
BreakingBenjamin,334l2e,KazuyaAnno,2,Sun Apr 19 23:09:07 2015 UTC,"Saturate and We Are Not Alone both have a nostalgic feel for me. However, if I had to pick the album with my most favorite songs it's Dear Agony hands down. Into The Nothing and Without You are my favorite songs. They're a great ending to that album."
BreakingBenjamin,334l2e,MattTheKatt,2,Sun Apr 19 23:36:44 2015 UTC,"Dear Agony gets my vote. It is the complete package. Don't get me wrong; all of their other albums are fantastic. We Are Not Alone drew me in. Saturate got my heart pumping. Phobia is full of emotional ballads which I love. But, Dear Agony has it all."
BreakingBenjamin,3331q9,DanTheMan_622,5,Sun Apr 19 01:19:54 2015 UTC,"I'm glad they're able to do all the background vocals live now, but jeez, they really need to tighten them up a little bit. At least one of them were off key most of the time."
BreakingBenjamin,3331q9,metalfan2680,1 point,Sun Apr 19 04:26:16 2015 UTC,"I must say, I really wasn't impressed. It may have been bad audio from the phone and/or stage, but everything seemed a bit off, particularly vocally.  But meh, we'll see. I'm still excited to be seeing them in about a month! :-)"
BreakingBenjamin,3331q9,timmehfx,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:21:27 2015 UTC,"Vocally off as usual, instrumentally B.B. is as tight as I've ever heard them. Seems like they're trying to replicate the album sound as much as possible, which is cool."
BreakingBenjamin,32zu6w,XxShrimpTacoxX,15,Sat Apr 18 03:11:03 2015 UTC,"For me it's ""Into the Nothing"". That whole album of Dear Agony was pretty dark, and this song is no different. By far my favorite BB song of all time."
BreakingBenjamin,32zu6w,the_team_plug,10,Sat Apr 18 03:27:06 2015 UTC,"As far as song pace goes, my vote is for ""Rain"". I don't think they've done many slower songs like that. I loved that song so much I used it as my senior quote back in the day. ""Take the photograph. It'll be the last. Not a dollar or a crowd could ever keep me here."""
BreakingBenjamin,32zu6w,brajmoss,9,Sat Apr 18 15:12:37 2015 UTC,"Anthem of the angels, and without you where he says I can't bare to face the truth. But I think diary of Jane is about his love or crush committing suicide before he tells her how he feels which is probably the saddest if that was his meaning"
BreakingBenjamin,32zu6w,That-1-White-Guy,2,Sat Apr 18 04:16:49 2015 UTC,My interpretation of diary of Jane is someone he had unrequited love for killed themselves. Idk if that's what he intended but the music video sure makes it look like that
BreakingBenjamin,32zu6w,That-1-White-Guy,6,Sat Apr 18 04:33:59 2015 UTC,"Would have to be Rain, or the acoustic version of Without You. Song hits home real hard"
BreakingBenjamin,32zu6w,phoenixflame611,3,Sat Apr 18 11:45:34 2015 UTC,Ironically rain for me is a calming song. I have more than once played this song when I was stressed out. I actually hope to make it a lilliby if I ever have children thanks to breaking Ben.
BreakingBenjamin,32zu6w,Raidenwtf,1 point,Sat Apr 18 15:17:14 2015 UTC,Agreed. I think Without You is already sad. But that acoustic is rough!
BreakingBenjamin,32zu6w,AdrianHD,4,Sun Apr 19 05:12:45 2015 UTC,"Give Me A Sign, Into The Nothing, and Unknown Soldier.  A lot of them a pretty depressing, but those are the top 3 for me."
BreakingBenjamin,32zu6w,hollow-heroes,2,Sat Apr 25 16:05:33 2015 UTC,Have to agree. Add Without You and these are my contenders as well.
BreakingBenjamin,32zu6w,ATCaver,5,Sat Apr 18 06:51:55 2015 UTC,"Anthem of the Angels, Dear Agony, Into the Nothing, Without You, and Breath."

It came on shortly after I heard the news of him passing and its a song that's sad as it reminds me he's gone but happy for the memories.
BreakingBenjamin,32zu6w,bradderz958,1 point,Sun Apr 19 07:51:48 2015 UTC,"I can't really rank them, but Give Me a Sign is a strong contender."

BreakingBenjamin,32zu6w,QuantumVexation,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:19:40 2015 UTC,"Anthem of the Angels is probably the darkest and saddest on the whole.  The new one, Angels Fall, has a dark lyrics but the way it's played isn't ominous like Anthem is.  It could almost be Anthem of the Angels pt. II."

Most of this appears to stem from various fears or alcoholism in Ben's life. I would argue that most of their songs are not really coming from sadness, but rather from these.

BreakingBenjamin,32jg2j,A_Zombie_Riot,8,Tue Apr 14 19:33:21 2015 UTC,Pretty calm song.    I'm ready for a scream or two.
BreakingBenjamin,32jg2j,DPick02,3,Tue Apr 14 14:55:38 2015 UTC,"Now this is what I'm talking about, such diverse verses but a finality to it with some attitude. Love the sound of it. Chorus  is a bit  meh to me though."

BreakingBenjamin,32jg2j,OneFinalEffort,3,Wed Apr 15 04:38:13 2015 UTC,"Looking forward to the rest of the album! And I liked this (a bit) more than ""Failure""... Instrumentally, that song sounded really similar to  ""Dear Agony"" / ""Fade Away."" But maybe that's just me?"
BreakingBenjamin,32jg2j,fluffykerfluffle,2,Wed Apr 15 22:20:05 2015 UTC,"I only just noticed this song was in my library.  I bought the album already, and at first it was just Failure that was released, right?  When did this one get released, any ideas?"

BreakingBenjamin,32keey,rhcp88,2,Wed Apr 15 00:30:36 2015 UTC,"Not bad, not great, it'll probably grow on me."
BreakingBenjamin,32keey,I_Am_Hank_Hill_AMA,2,Wed Apr 15 05:44:21 2015 UTC,"I happened across a leaked version of their new song, ""Defeated."" It is a bit heavier than ""Angels Fall."" I like they both, but I definitely agree about want some additional heavier songs on the album. Part of why I like BB so much is that they typically show a good range."
BreakingBenjamin,32keey,xangria,3,Wed Apr 15 22:56:38 2015 UTC,Not my favorite. It's alright I guess. The only reason I even like it a little bit is because I'm a BB fanboy. If I wasn't such a huge fan I'd probably hate this song.
BreakingBenjamin,32keey,PhxRising29,2,Tue Apr 14 17:05:17 2015 UTC,"It's alright. Not the best, the lyrics are too cliche.  Still decent though"
BreakingBenjamin,32keey,marie398,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:00:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's trying a little bit too hard to be a ""deep"" ballad. It's good, but I'm not sold on it."
BreakingBenjamin,32keey,metalfan2680,1 point,Wed Apr 15 12:12:56 2015 UTC,"This is already one of my favourite of their more balled-esque songs. There's definitely going to be a good range of heavier and more chill songs, just like on previous records, no worries about that."
BreakingBenjamin,32keey,DanTheMan_622,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:02:26 2015 UTC,The lyrics get a biiit too repetitive for me but I really don't care...
BreakingBenjamin,32keey,n00boxular,0,Wed Apr 15 10:39:49 2015 UTC,"I like it. I prefer Failure over Angels Fall and haven't heard Defeated yet, though. I have a feeling this will be my 3rd favorite song out of the 3.   I truly hope there is atleast one song on the album that has the same vibe as Saturate though. I love Breaking Benjamin but the last 2 albums have felt very repetitive. Almost cookie cutter.  I'm no music buff so I can't describe it, I just love Breaking Benjamin. Especially the first 2 albums. While I enjoyed them, I just didn't fall in love with Phobia and Dear Agony like I did Saturate and We Are Not Alone. But Phobia and Dear Agony seem to be the majority's favorite BB albums. Meh."
BreakingBenjamin,32keey,jalexander86,0,Wed Apr 22 23:03:59 2015 UTC,I like the first 3 but Dear Agony was meh. I still like it though.
BreakingBenjamin,32keey,MattTheKatt,0,Fri May 1 20:36:45 2015 UTC,"I want a song like Believe or Sugarcoat, I like it when albums have that one song that's just really heavy, Dear Agony had a lot of screaming but it didn't really feel heavy to me."

BreakingBenjamin,32iguz,trt13shell,5,Tue Apr 14 01:32:04 2015 UTC,Burnley got in a legal dispute with the other members.
BreakingBenjamin,32iguz,ChrisChrisWTF,2,Tue Apr 14 05:15:42 2015 UTC,What went wrong?
BreakingBenjamin,32iguz,echojester,6,Tue Apr 14 11:14:30 2015 UTC,"While Ben was sick two other members (Aaron and mark) signed off on some permissions (specifically the remix of Blow Me Away Feat. Valora) without Ben's consent. Considering Ben is the primary singer/songwriter of the band he removed Aaron and Mark of their duties. Shortly after he begun the process to sue them for those actions and also to retain full rights to the band's name, logo, songs and likenesses. Ben won the legal battle (which is why they are still known as BB, why they can play old material at shows). Ben now holds all the rights to the band and pervious materials. After the suit, just Ben and Chad were left, and Chad eventually departed as well to continue his playing with Black Label Society where he was filling in while the band was on hiatus.  So you have a legal battle, Ben trying to get healthy, Ben trying to start a family, and the need to find three new band members; hence the 6 year hiatus."
BreakingBenjamin,32iguz,ctskifreak,2,Tue Apr 14 12:15:47 2015 UTC,Has there been any specifics of what the health issues are/were? That's the one thing I never saw a definitive answer to.
BreakingBenjamin,32iguz,HopeLikeFire,4,Tue Apr 14 14:10:05 2015 UTC,"Burnley is a recovering alcoholic, admitting in an interview with listenin.org that he wanted to ""drink himself to death."" He says that he regrets ever drinking a drop of alcohol and is victim to Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome due to his past excessive drinking. Dear Agony was reported to be the first ever Breaking Benjamin record to be written by Burnley without the aid of alcohol.   Source"
BreakingBenjamin,32iguz,ctskifreak,3,Tue Apr 14 14:26:37 2015 UTC,"I think I knew about the alcohol, but not the syndrome. Thanks for that."
BreakingBenjamin,32iguz,craigmej,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:44:29 2015 UTC,They released a remix of blow me away without ben's permission and with a studio he hates IIRC
BreakingBenjamin,32iguz,echojester,3,Tue Apr 14 12:15:57 2015 UTC,"By studio, do you mean label? Hard to say that Ben ""hates"" Hollywood, considering they're still signed to that label. I know he's had troubles with them in the past (such as Hollywood pushing Skin as a single off of Saturate instead of the band's preferred choice; Medicate). Ultimately, after it all, Breaking Benjamin is still a Hollywood Recording Artist and Hollywood is still releasing Dark Before Dawn."
BreakingBenjamin,32iguz,craigmej,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:07:41 2015 UTC,"Read about it a long time ago, you're probably right. All i remember was ben was supposedly pissed about the song and something/someone involved in it"

BreakingBenjamin,31baog,razielsoulreaver,2,Fri Apr 3 16:23:37 2015 UTC,"Hell yes, i have to wait almost three weeks  to see them. Im so tired excited"
BreakingBenjamin,31baog,razielsoulreaver,3,Fri Apr 3 16:26:18 2015 UTC,"You will not be disappointed. I'm glad I had the chance to see the original group, and now I'm excited to see the new lineup."
BreakingBenjamin,31baog,RedStag86,3,Fri Apr 3 16:32:55 2015 UTC,Im really hoping they will play away. Easily my favorite song of theirs
BreakingBenjamin,31baog,razielsoulreaver,3,Fri Apr 3 16:41:05 2015 UTC,"Away is incredible, especially live. I think it was the Youngstown show I saw that one. I've seen the 3 times, and my fourth is coming up in May in Grand Rapids, MI. So excited!"

BreakingBenjamin,31baog,Phobiass,4,Tue Apr 7 22:14:47 2015 UTC,"I've had the pleasure of seeing them 3 times. Once in 2010 with their original lineup, once last fall during their unplugged tour, and once in February during their winter tour. The first one was very impersonal, and they didn't interact with the crowd too much, but it was still an amazing show. The second time was the best concert I've ever been too (and I've been to A LOT) of concerts. Ben nearly teared up as he heard how loud we were cheering for them. The whole band interacted with us so much, and you could genuinely tell how much they loved their fans. It was such an intimate experience too since it was such a small venue. My third show was not as good as the second, but they still did a fantastic job of interacting with the crowd and played a great array of songs,including an awesome medley of cover songs (Metallica, Tool, Nirvana, Pantera I think it was). They definitely know how to please a crowd. All in all, they are the best band I have ever seen live (I may be a bit biased since they are my all time favorite band, as my one and so far only tattoo on my back shows lol). You'll definitely have a great experience there, I don't think I could ever get bored of seeing them live. Hope you have fun!"
BreakingBenjamin,31baog,Maccadude33,3,Fri Apr 3 20:46:56 2015 UTC,I saw them way back on tour with three days Grace and nickelback...in that order...mind you I was about 13 at the time but they were amazing and that's the reason I'm subscribed to this sub today.
BreakingBenjamin,31baog,Phobiass,3,Sat Apr 4 05:07:58 2015 UTC,"I first saw them in December 2009 with Papa Roach (not long after Dear Agony came out), and they sounded great. That show was in a medium-sized theater (~6000 people). Then I saw them again in May 2010 when they were on tour with Shinedown and Nickelback... shudders  That show was in a large stadium (~20,000 people tops) and they killed it. Blow Me Away sounded absolutely massive in the arena, definitely one of my favorite performances. Assuming the new band members have had enough time to gel and Ben brings back his old sound techs, I'd expect them to sound very clean and professional like they used to."

BreakingBenjamin,319bed,hari3079,3,Fri Apr 3 00:55:16 2015 UTC,"From what I can remember from discussions on The Shallow Bay, these two songs were never recorded in a studio.  Both were what most people consider early versions of So Cold.  I remember hearing that after Saturate, Hollywood Records put a lot of pressure on Ben, as the sales numbers were not there.  So Cold was born.  That is the song that solidified Breaking Benjamin as a band that was here to stay.  WANA went on to sell a boat load of copies."
BreakingBenjamin,319bed,vhawk12,2,Fri Apr 3 14:52:23 2015 UTC,"I agree. There was never a studio recording, I've heard every rare track they released (any other no-games.com veterans here?)

BreakingBenjamin,30wyf2,mikeo490,5,Fri Apr 3 18:27:17 2015 UTC,The two songs are currently purchasable on the UK version of Amazon here
BreakingBenjamin,30wyf2,Claymore2106,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:26:51 2015 UTC,Omg they sound so sick!

BreakingBenjamin,30wyf2,citieskid,2,Thu Apr 2 02:44:52 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah I did the same thing. I did a bit of reading on it, and you may need to call your bank to make a purchase outside of the US. Said its a form of theft protection"

BreakingBenjamin,30wyf2,Akwalla,2,Thu Apr 2 05:37:33 2015 UTC,Wow. Both of these tracks are great. Cannot wait for the new album!
BreakingBenjamin,30wyf2,Baselt95,3,Thu Apr 2 15:52:59 2015 UTC,It happened last night on the UK iTunes store.  It was taken down pretty quickly.  I would love get a hold of the two tracks since i didn't get a chance to download them.

BreakingBenjamin,30yhei,Phobiass,6,Tue Mar 31 18:58:22 2015 UTC,"I've thought that about previous albums as well. Or rather, I like how it's subtle and up to personal interpretation. It's great that you can enjoy his music and find whatever you want in it, religious or not. As you say, Dear Agony definitely took a turn towards that. To me, ""Give Me a Sign"", ""Into the Nothing"" and ""Without You"" are difficult not to interpret from a Christian viewpoint.   I live in a country where Christianity and other religions are dwindling and frequently frowned upon and ridiculed, so to me it's nice that one of my favourite artists is finding his balance between God and angels, and screaming f*** at the top of his lungs(!) I'm a fan of all his songs, spiritual or not."
BreakingBenjamin,30yhei,ToffeeKing,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:56:33 2015 UTC,That's what I thought. Ive always liked how he keeps it vague for people to take their own meaning from the song.
BreakingBenjamin,30yhei,Leeham721,1 point,Sat Apr 4 05:45:07 2015 UTC,Damn titles.
BreakingBenjamin,30is6y,Dred363,1 point,Fri Mar 27 18:57:10 2015 UTC,I envy you so much. My favorite band going to Indy and so does my favorite team (colts) meanwhile I wait here in California for BB to visit
BreakingBenjamin,30is6y,muchohermano,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:27:16 2015 UTC,I'll be there! It'll be my 4th time seeing them.
BreakingBenjamin,30hlwr,mynameispenis,3,Fri Mar 27 13:25:41 2015 UTC,Where did you message him? Been trying to find out if Dark before Dawn will be available in UK Itunes but no response so far.
BreakingBenjamin,30hlwr,craigmej,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:11:42 2015 UTC,"On Facebook, I can just inbox him, timing needs to be right for a reply though. I am his friend on Facebook, but he's got a band Page for himself, plus he's on Twitter and instagram a lot too."
BreakingBenjamin,30hlwr,craigmej,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:55:48 2015 UTC,"Mind asking him? If he already kinda knows you it can't hurt. All the Uk gets is phobia. 1 out of 5 isn't great.  Edit: I've tried getting hold of the band on twitter but got no response, it would really suck if the UK got left out again. Like New Zealand has it. Population of that place is like 3 at most.Why not us. I get i'll never see them live and i respect ben's choice to avoid flying but if i cant even get the album how are we supposed to support them."
BreakingBenjamin,30hlwr,craigmej,1 point,Fri Mar 27 23:30:12 2015 UTC,To be honest a reply would be unlikely. He seems to mostly reply when it is fans congratulating him ect ect. Have you tried other mediums to get the music? Amazon and whatnot. I haven't checked Australian services to see if they have it. I've just been streaming for the meantime
BreakingBenjamin,30hlwr,craigmej,1 point,Fri Mar 27 23:58:18 2015 UTC,"Only have an ipod, thats the only device i can use for music. Never get any reply. Im willing to bet its not just UK, they're losing money by stopping me from paying them. It just seems really pointless not to make it available to everyone. im a bitter drunk but this has been bugging me for awhile so its not just vodka speaking. Like yaeh im really fucking happy they're back, yeah im looking forward to the album but really it's going to be a pain in the ass to get it."
BreakingBenjamin,30hlwr,mook91,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:18:58 2015 UTC,That really is a pickle man. I'm not too sure on how else I can help :(
BreakingBenjamin,30hlwr,TomaTozzz,2,Sat Mar 28 01:01:13 2015 UTC,Looking at this in the morning i have no idea what i was thinking. Sorry man i just kinda ranted for awhile. Thanks for putting up with drunkmej
BreakingBenjamin,307bil,Ravenfall7,7,Wed Mar 25 01:26:14 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah, love hearing news like this so fast after they release the pre-order."
BreakingBenjamin,307bil,Ravenfall7,9,Wed Mar 25 02:23:02 2015 UTC,I like how active this subreddit is now. All the posts coming from BB is helping with that I guess.
BreakingBenjamin,307bil,UnsinkableRubberDuck,5,Wed Mar 25 02:46:37 2015 UTC,Yeah I hope that it continues.
BreakingBenjamin,307bil,UnsinkableRubberDuck,5,Wed Mar 25 02:49:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe they'll have enough success to finally tour somewhat close to me :D  He can get to Western Canada over land, it'd be a long drive, but they could go by train even :)"
BreakingBenjamin,307bil,Bergy_37,4,Wed Mar 25 03:58:31 2015 UTC,I'm hoping I'll get to see them live at some point too. I live in Australia though so my chances are minimal. We can dream though.  Edit:Typo
BreakingBenjamin,307bil,JoeLithium,2,Wed Mar 25 04:11:22 2015 UTC,You'll just have to make a trip to this continent!
BreakingBenjamin,307bil,dickinmytatertots,2,Wed Mar 25 04:21:59 2015 UTC,Have before. Loved it. Will have do it again to catch a show.
BreakingBenjamin,3059or,CorporalThornberry,5,Tue Mar 24 16:24:35 2015 UTC,"I haven't bought anything on iTunes in probably 2 years. Went out to buy a $15 iTunes card specifically so I could buy this album.   Failure is a great song and actually fits in with a convo a friend and I were having last night, about feeling old and like we wasted our 20s. It's a cheerful song and I felt encouraged and got all warm in the cockles of my heart."
BreakingBenjamin,3059or,UnsinkableRubberDuck,2,Tue Mar 24 21:02:58 2015 UTC,Same. This is the first album in over a year that I haven't torrented just to support the band
BreakingBenjamin,3059or,Wiwom,3,Wed Mar 25 11:02:07 2015 UTC,Hell yes.
BreakingBenjamin,3059or,Ravenfall7,7,Tue Mar 24 20:52:36 2015 UTC,"This song isn't a failure, it's tearing the whole world down"

BreakingBenjamin,303zfu,Netwelle,7,Tue Mar 24 07:45:53 2015 UTC,"It is from 1998. I got it from them when they made it. I am actually not sure the time frame for the band. Aaron and the Bass player were in a band called Lifer around that time. Another friend of ours was the drummer, Chris Lightcap. He now does sound for Shinedown. So this might be Ben before that, though I think Jeremy Hummel was the drummer then. Another guy from or hometown."
BreakingBenjamin,303zfu,The4horsemen,2,Tue Mar 24 14:02:47 2015 UTC,"That's actually really cool, dude. Based off of that mixtape how much would you say they have changed as a band throughout the times?"
BreakingBenjamin,303zfu,The4horsemen,3,Tue Mar 24 14:24:28 2015 UTC,Shit I have been listening to them play since they start playing instruments. I was with Aaron and his mom when he picked out his first amp. Carvin? I think. They all used to jam together. Aarons mom was a teacher at rival school. She introduced them to Andrew who played drums. He started coming over to our town to jam. Epoch was born. Aaron was playing in another band at the time. It was high school. Everyone was just having fun.  It was a large floating group of people that hung out. Some are still going strong. All but one of the guys from Waylon Speed out of vermont were part of the crew. They just played SXSW last week. Chris Lightcap was there. He was part of lifer and maybe BB kinda around the 1998 time. He is now sound guy for Shinedown. Our high school produced a huge amount of successful artists from that time period. Many of the kids who are not in bands anymore are still working in the music industry.
BreakingBenjamin,303zfu,DanTheMan_622,2,Tue Mar 24 15:00:45 2015 UTC,"I guess I didn't answer the question. I would say they all evolved alot. They have been around the block since 8th grade. I think from my perspective the major changed did not come in their music but in the ways they ""grew up"". They all had their own pace. Last time I hung out with Aaron was at a show in Salt Lake City. I was there for a tradeshow and they happened to be playing in the city and we crossed paths. This was the tour Ben started using his own tour bus because nobody could stand to near him. They were all in different stages of their lives even though musically I think they were growing together."
BreakingBenjamin,303zfu,mf4488,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:05:02 2015 UTC,That's awesome! So no one could stand to be near Ben? Why was that? Just didn't get along? Sorry if I didn't understand what you said.
BreakingBenjamin,303zfu,Ravenfall7,2,Tue Mar 24 19:09:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know the why, but yeah. They just didn't get along. I actually found it kinda ironic. I was hanging out with Aaron in Colorado Springs at one of their shows. They were touring with Korn. Aaron was telling me how all the members hate each other and use separate buses and separate dressing rooms. They play their set and go back to their respective buses and are never seen.  Well fast forward a couple of years and I was on the bus with Aaron in Salt Lake City and I asked where Ben was. I wanted to say hello. He said Ben has his own bus. They seemed pretty annoyed about it, so I imagine it was Ben's idea. They said it was good because they did not have to spend much time with him but they were also pissed because it costs something stupid like 80-100k to rent and run a bus for a tour. So double that now because Ben needs his own bus."

BreakingBenjamin,300aua,mlplus44,6,Mon Mar 23 17:44:52 2015 UTC,"Overall I like it. Definitely feels like it has built off of Dear Agony. As a newbie to playing bass I thought it was cool how the bassist was slapping in the verse which I think is not very common in BB songs.   The only thing I found lacking was Aaron and Keith's vocals which were probably in there in the chorus, but I hope they have a more significant role vocals wise in the album. They were both fantastic live and I hope we get to hear more of them."
BreakingBenjamin,300aua,Ravenfall7,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:00:08 2015 UTC,"The bass slapping got me as well. U can actually hear some of that on Breakdown too.   The backup vocals should be in every song, they really sound amazing. Can't wait 2 months .-."

I was sceptical with the preview because the lyrics seemed to lack the subtlety that Ben used in past albums, but a majority of Dear Agony was the same way.

Considering that someone brought up the album cover looks like it has an ultrasound of Ben's child in it, which isn't too farfetched since he did a similar thing with the Dear Agony album.  I thought it was a bit weird that the song was about failure and the album cover may possible show his child. But then thinking about the album title ""Dark Before Dawn,"" it is more than likely this is a retrospective song. I am very interested to hear what the rest of the album sounds like, I think its going to be great.  I can't wait to see them in May in Pittsburgh and I wonder if they will tease any other songs from the album. I think we can all agree that this sounds like the BB we know and love, but I hope the other songs have some of the extra flares that Chad, Aaron, and Mark would throw in."
BreakingBenjamin,300aul,pdjohntony,6,Mon Mar 23 15:45:07 2015 UTC,Am I the only one that was skeptical after hearing the 20 second teaser?   Then by the first time the chorus rolled around in the full song all doubts were wiped away?
BreakingBenjamin,300aul,DPick02,3,Mon Mar 23 18:12:44 2015 UTC,After what Shinedown and Linkin Park put me through I'm always skeptical about new releases. Up until I was listening to it I was just praying that it wouldn't be shit. Glad the song turned out fantastic though.
BreakingBenjamin,300aul,Symtex123,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:10:24 2015 UTC,Breaking Benjamin has NEVER failed to make amazing things.  Ben has evolved. But has done it in an amazing way. Unlike other bands Cough Seether Cough
BreakingBenjamin,300aul,DamarisKitten,6,Mon Mar 23 22:23:25 2015 UTC,"Unconfirmed: The lyrics to ""Failure"" could have been written about the 2014/15 Toronto Maple Leafs season  ""Tired of feeling lost Tired of letting go Tear the whole world down (x2) Failure Tired of waisted breath Tired of nothing left Tear the whole world down (x2) Failure"""

BreakingBenjamin,300aul,MuscleMike,2,Mon Mar 23 21:51:20 2015 UTC,I will never be able to hear this song without thinking leafs again
BreakingBenjamin,300aul,autotune-mexican,9,Mon Mar 23 22:11:42 2015 UTC,"I think i speak for a good portion of the fanbase when i say that, I was a little worried when there was new members. The only way we knew that there was a similar sound was from either word of mouth or by shaky cell phone footage. Now that we have a full fledged studio recorded track, not much has changed, it feels like Breaking Benjamin, it sounds like Breaking Benjamin, guess what it is Breaking Benjamin. It feels like the band we know and love from 6 years ago, because it is. Awesome song, and now i can't wait for the Album to drop."
BreakingBenjamin,300aul,vhawk12,5,Mon Mar 23 14:10:21 2015 UTC,"I was worried about the drums to be honest.  I think Chad (and Jeremy for that matter) fit the mold so well that it almost seemed strange to not have him behind the kit.  With that said, I think the song is amazing, and the drums are great.  Honestly, it sounds a lot like Chad's playing, sans the insanely intricate and subtle splash and bell work.  Also worth mentioning that with Jasen in the band, the sky's the limit with what Ben and Jasen can do together.  Both are outrageously talented."
BreakingBenjamin,300aul,Baselt95,5,Mon Mar 23 14:47:52 2015 UTC,"I once read that Shaun was actually a student (friend too) of Chad, so I think he is doing a great job.   I really liked Chad (honestly more than Jeremy), but Shaun looks like a funny guy that you would love to hang out with too. :)"
BreakingBenjamin,300aul,AstraKyle,2,Mon Mar 23 20:16:08 2015 UTC,"The one thing that I noticed was a tad different is outside of the main riff there aren't very many of those quirky little leads in the chorus or especially the verses that Aaron Fink used to mess around with. Guess that was more of his style and not so much what Ben considered part of the sound, at least for this track."
BreakingBenjamin,300aul,autotune-mexican,3,Mon Mar 23 14:19:21 2015 UTC,"you're right about that, that might just be Fink's trademark though."
BreakingBenjamin,300aul,Baselt95,4,Mon Mar 23 14:23:14 2015 UTC,"Yea that's true. The new band that Fink did with Mark and some old friends still has that ""lead"" in the chorus. So yea, I guess it's his trademark."
BreakingBenjamin,300aul,ToffeeKing,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:17:14 2015 UTC,"I've been very sceptical that Ben would ever find people as talented as Mark, Chad and Aaron, but this song has me convinced the album will be really good.   I've listened a bit to Stardog Champion and Gentleman East and I like to imagine I can hear Aaron on the guitar. He sounds great whatever he plays, but his playstyle went really well with Ben's songs and I'll miss hearing his riffs. Rauch seems extremely talented as well though."

I had no doubts that it would be the same sound since he was the one to keep everything. I am, however, worried about the band that the singer left and the new album is coming out the 31st. That I'm nervous about.   ALTHOUGH, there were rumors that Ben and Gontier were making some songs together. Praying for that on this album.   Wasn't an album release date already announced?

I wasn't a crazy fan of how repetitive Human Race was. As my friend said, it sounds like they took 2 minutes of song and put it into 4. Still hoping the album is good though cause Painkiller and I am Machine were good.  As for Breaking Benjamin it's good to know I'll have a band that didn't really change from a member change. It sounds like they could have released this album a day after Dear Agony. It's perfect and Failure is a great start. I like that this subreddit exploded when it was released to.

One of my favorite things about BB is Ben's ability to just bring so much emotion to his vocals, and I was really excited to see that in Failure. The new members also seem to be doing well, especially considering the fact that BB had a very unique sound especially in the drum/guitar area.   Overall, I'm really optimistic about this album."
BreakingBenjamin,300aul,SgtShadow,2,Mon Mar 23 15:52:05 2015 UTC,I saw the announcement on facebook and freaked out. I needed it in my life immediately. I went to iTunes and bought it instantly on my phone. I listened to it once and thought it wasn't just good. It was VERY good and reminded me of old BB. I have had the song on repeat since the second listen. I can't get enough and I want more! I need this whole album in my life. But I will wait patiently. I'm hoping they play a couple more songs off the new album when I see them live in May.

When I first started listening to ""failure"" I was a little let down. Only because they've set the bar so high with their past music. But once I got to the end of failure I was blown away and hooked. That ending gave me goosebumps and reminded me of the first time I binge listened to all their music when I first started listening to them. So excited for this album."

BreakingBenjamin,300x5k,GeorgedaflashGlass,1 point,Mon Mar 23 16:26:56 2015 UTC,"I've been listening to Breaking Benjamin and going to their live shows since saturate came out. As much as your statement holds a lot of truth I'm going to have to disagree. I recently saw them back in Feb with the new lineup. They were pretty good, but it just wasn't the same as the other 9 times I've seen them. Just getting new members isn't enough sometimes. The chemistry between the members is an important aspect too and I feel like some of that left.   Also, as much as Ben has always been mostly the sole song writer, I can't help but feel like the band gave him some influence. And now with this new guitarist from Red, I ready see some of their influence in the new song. I hope that breaking Benjamin can be as good as they always have been on the new album, but I just can't help but feeling like as good as they are, they're just not the same anymore."
BreakingBenjamin,300x5k,Sha11owBay,2,Tue Mar 24 00:06:35 2015 UTC,"To be fair, they need to get used to being around each other."
BreakingBenjamin,300x5k,AdrianHD,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:29:43 2015 UTC,So true. The original members of the band have been playing instruments together since 4th grade. Ben has cycled through musicians and I do believe it has changed the sound a bit. Aaron had a lot of influence in the guitar sound of the band. Aaron has always been a better player then Ben. Since we were kids.

BreakingBenjamin,2z6w64,SgtShadow,2,Mon Mar 16 03:33:47 2015 UTC,I remember on facebook a while back they posted a video of them playing and it said something about new music on the way. Been a while though.
BreakingBenjamin,2z6w64,MrEpiX,1 point,Mon Mar 16 12:09:10 2015 UTC,"It doesn't sound like you means this, so I'm going to link it for you."
BreakingBenjamin,2z6w64,SgtShadow,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:21:35 2015 UTC,No it wasn't that one. It was another one and I feel like it's about 6 months old. I'll try to find it.  Edit: I can't find the video. It doesn't seem to be there anymore. I will still search for it though. It basically confirmed they were in the studio working though.
BreakingBenjamin,2z6w64,SgtShadow,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:13:40 2015 UTC,Possibly. It had them playing in the back ground I believe. My memory may be a bit foggy to be honest.

BreakingBenjamin,2yt4ni,ctskifreak,6,Thu Mar 12 16:42:51 2015 UTC,"I'm going to assume new single. It sounds just enough like the band's older stuff, but has a newer edge to it that is getting me hyped.  EDIT: spelling"

BreakingBenjamin,2yt4ni,Unicorn_Pie,6,Thu Mar 12 16:31:59 2015 UTC,"I assume it will be an announcement of some sort. If we are lucky, maybe a new song.   It would be pretty sweet if they just dropped the album 3/23."
BreakingBenjamin,2yt4ni,karhall,3,Thu Mar 12 16:39:25 2015 UTC,feel like its too short notice for album release but we'll see I suppose.
BreakingBenjamin,2yt4ni,mintrolling,9,Thu Mar 12 16:42:46 2015 UTC,"Gotta say, though, I would prefer it if bands did things like that more often. Just go ""HEY GUYS NEW ALBUM!"" and everyone says ""When? When?"" and the band says ""RIGHT NOW YOU GUYS!"" and you can just go buy it."
BreakingBenjamin,2yt4ni,Wiwom,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:04:10 2015 UTC,Like Radiohead has done in the past. I haven't been around for many releases by my favorite bands but I wish more artists would do that sort of thing. Realizing you'll get to hear new content in a matter of weeks or so is much better than waiting a year.
BreakingBenjamin,2yt4ni,tarantula_eater,5,Fri Mar 13 15:07:13 2015 UTC,"Either that, or a new song."
BreakingBenjamin,2yt4ni,Leeham721,1 point,Thu Mar 12 16:42:36 2015 UTC,There's no way that they would just drop an album. I would bet Obamas life that it's a single. Album will follow in a few months.

While I loved that show, I had so much more fun at this one and thought it was way better. They just looked like they were having so much fun, they sounded absolutely fantastic, and the crowd was awesome.   Edit cause I can't math, and this is apparently 2015...which would make it 5 years. I'm a super smart chick sometimes."
BreakingBenjamin,2vm73r,BlackLaceParasol,2,Thu Feb 12 11:58:36 2015 UTC,Between the end of the set and the encore the crowd was deafening

BreakingBenjamin,2trx67,Surelythisisntaclone,1 point,Tue Jan 27 11:37:24 2015 UTC,"It looks like there is no difference between those two in the formats that are supported. Still, I would try riping the CDs again into your iTunes library, first deleting the songs you have now from disk and then riping. I say this because apple might have done something weird to your files in order to stop pirates. If you have 32GB or more of space, I would recommend RIPing them in the Apple Lossless Codec. You miss a lot from Breaking Benjamin with the other formats. If you have 16GB-32GB, Id recommend MP3 on the highest quality."

BreakingBenjamin,2sa1tz,jd824,1 point,Tue Jan 13 16:23:54 2015 UTC,"I figure with the amount of big shows they have lined up for a summer tour, they might have at least one new single out around then. Something that has the mark of the new band. They're booked for rock on the range and mayhem fest, seems like perfect platforms to release and promote a new single. Ride the single through the summer months and then a new album out around November-ish? Just a thought from a marketing standpoint."
BreakingBenjamin,2sa1tz,echojester,0,Wed Jan 14 15:36:53 2015 UTC,You are correct Ben has said that the whole #BBIsBack thing was just about the band coming back and has said that it doesn't mean the are making an album. Although it also doesn't mean they aren't.
BreakingBenjamin,2sa1tz,MA0801,2,Wed Jan 14 13:15:18 2015 UTC,"I spoke to Aaron Bruch via facebook and asked about a new album. He said they have enough songs for an album and they're constantly writing more, they're waiting on management to sort out an album release."

They are constantly working on new material and there will be a tour announcement in the next few months. Also, Ben wants to start playing other countries and continents and is going to try to have their label help get them a boat."

September 26, 2014  First off, I wanna start by saying WELCOME BACK!   What made you decide to reform Breaking Benjamin?  Well Breaking Benjamin didn't really reform, I always kind of had the band ever since before anybody it was kind of my own thing for a really long time and basically just got into a group of guys, its more of like a nine inch nails type of thing, where i kind of just been the band cause I'm like the primary writer. I always had the music & I always been the writer. How did you meet the new band members & how did you guys together? The drummer (Shaun Foist) I met while on tour, he is actually a friend of my old drummer (Chad Szeliga) & then the guitar players from Adelitas Way, & I've done a lot of touring with them i pretty much met all the guys on tour, except for the bass player, The bass player was a local guy, that is very very talented but just didn't have the luck that we’ve had but definitely had the talent he just didn't have the luck but I guess its not true cause he is where he is supposed to be now.  You had two shows in your hometown this past weekend which were both completely sold out & how did it feel to get back out there and see all your loyal fans still there? Oh man, well its great. any band would be nothing without their fans, this is no different. The fans are pretty much the heart & soul of any band and so its an honor to be there for them and their the best fans any band could ever ask for, they've always been and they always will be & just were really grateful, nothing but grateful to the fans for keeping the band alive & keeping the support alive like Its definitely a fan driven band as far as I’m concerned because if the fans weren't there and didn't really attach to the music as much as they have I probably wouldn't do it, I wouldn't force myself or my material on people and try to make them like it, I just always been the kind of writer that I just really like certain things. I like writing music that I like to hear when I'm listening to music, so i just kind of have the same kind of ear that my fans have, we all like the same type of music, we all like the same things and so thats what makes it so strong I think thats the secret to it is that I just write the kind of music that is the same kind of music we like to hear, even with other bands.  Did you ever have a show sellout like that, like within a few hours of the shows being announced? Not that i know of, that was pretty amazing to have that happen & again we are completely humbled & nothing but grateful for the support that the fans have given & having them welcome us back cause were there for them, were not there for us, we are there for our fans. If the band claims that are aren't there for their fans then they should just not play or be there at all. Were there just for them & to have them welcome us that way & show us that support. We grow with our fans, & its all about them. Its all for them no matter what in the end. We create the music for them, We play shows for them, & then in turn they make us feel good about it so we keep doing it, its like a reciprocal kind of thing but it all starts with them, they are the most important thing about the band. The fans are definitely the most important thing about any band. A lot of fans want to know when you're writing music, what inspire your lyrics? Its seems a lot of your music has a very meaningful message behind it. Yes, A lot of them honestly just come to me & I don't really know how they do they just do & I get really inspire by movies a lot of the time because movies, I love movies & you know they’re moving a lot of them. They like make me feel empowered & so I get a lot of lyrics not like from quotes from movies per say but how a movie makes you feel. So I will take that feeling and translate that feeling into something. Or just anything, I could be driving around in my car and ill just mumble some notes into my recorder on my phone and sometimes ill just be like writing a song and ill just sing a song out of no where. Like with Diary Of Jane, when I was writing that verse “Do you like that, Do you like that?” it just came to me, there was no thought it just came like straight to my head.   What is the song Diary of Jane actually about? That I actually was watching one of those forensics shows, and they were talking about a Jane Doe that they found and she didn't have a name and they were backtracking to see who she was and they were trying to put an identity to her and like I just got the base idea from that, not that its based on that but I got the base idea from that.   I understand your soon to be a dad expecting your first child in November, Do you think becoming a parent will affect your music in anyway, or do you think you'll be making new music about your experiences as a parent? Well I think that its a little too soon to tell cause obviously he is not here yet but I would welcome it, I mean any sort of influence ill take as long as the music is still badass, But I probably wouldn't try to force it but if it happens I would accept it. If I was influenced by my son I would accept it but I wouldn't try to make it unnatural. After announcing the two SOLD-OUT performances in your hometown of Wilkes-Barre PA, all of your fans want to know is there any plans to tour/tour worldwide in the works? Yea, I definitely think there will be a lot of touring coming, and doing a lot of what we've done in the past and coming to seeing all of our fans all over the world hopefully this time around & mainly just start out in the United States and do that and ill try to get on a boat and get over to Brazil and wherever else our fans are from.  There is actually a petition online to enable Breaking Benjamin to tour worldwide, I don't know if you guys seen that yet or not. It currently has about 900 signatures on it. Yes, we have seen it & I will show that to my record label when it gets to a really high number and ill tell them to get on board with it. I think they'll be ways that ill be able to facilitate to get on a boat whether its with the labels cooperation or not cause its been long enough that i haven't been able to get overseas, and ill do everything that I can to see what I can do. But yes long story short, the band is definitely planning on doing a lot of touring, but I got my baby due in November & thats going to come first. So I will just try to work around that right now. I would say in the next few months you will see a tour announcement. On that tour what would you be doing setlist wise. A mix of the music or just on a certain album already released? What would be your favorite song to play live? Yes, it would be a mix of all of Breaking Benjamin catalog. Songs that are fun to play & songs that are really well known and just a mix of all of that. I don't really have a favorite song to play live I like to play Diary of Jane just because its known and its fun when people sing along and are shouting the lyrics back at you, But technically speaking the song itself i don't really prefer one over the other. They are all equally the same, I mean singing and playing wise, I still play and sing so that aspects the same."
BreakingBenjamin,2hjybc,Careocyn,1 point,Fri Sep 26 21:44:13 2014 UTC,"11. Would you say your band has change now that a fifth member has been added to the bands already awesome lineup?  Well yes, its a lot better. The guitars just sound so much better and so sick because when your in the studio and your recording you lay like four, five or even six guitars down overtop one another & so there is no rule out there that says your band has to have 2 guitar players, one drummer and a bass player. Having a fifth person actually allows us to get a lot closer to recreating our album sound and still having a live feel to it, and then too it makes it so i could actually put the guitar down and just sing for a couple songs here and there but i still play for 95% of the show. I actually put the guitar down during “I Will Not Bow” on the Friday show you attended cause that song is kind of designed to be just sung, its not really designed to be sung and played. Like Tool songs, i could sing and play songs but they are not really designed to play and sing but like Nirvana songs are designed to play guitar and sing too. They're certain songs that just lend themselves to playing and singing to. There are songs i don't play and are better off when i could really just zone in on the vocals and let the band do their thing ya know? It just adds another dynamic to the band, the band doesnt run any tracks and we dont play to a clique, everything is just natural and organic and there is nothing lacking cause we have not only an extra guitar player but 2 more singers that are actually singers from other bands. Guys have a misconception about bands that says you don't need to be a singer to do background vocals and thats completely untrue as a matter a fact the background vocals are harder to sing then the main vocals cause their higher. You absolutely need to be a full on singer to sing background vocals and it just makes the band sound so much more like our albums but still has that live vibe to it cause its being performed live. Its not being performed 150% like the album is but its still a really tight vocal aspect and in some spots it sounds like dead on if not better as some bands actually sound better live then on their album. When I say its not 110% like the album i dont mean that in a bad way its got more of an attitude about it cause its got that live energy to it. WE have that now, but before not to let any cats out of the bag or anything but we had a clique that we would play to and we had some other things like never main vocals or anything like that but like in our samples like So cold there is strings and stuff in the background. Well all of that stuff is now played live we use a GR-55 guitar synthesizer to play all of those strings and everybody's singing and were not on a clique. We used to have to have a clique like a metronome in our ears and we would have to play along to that so that the other samples and stuff lineup and now we don't have any of that its now all played. Either by the drummer or somebody sings it or somebody plays it on the guitar synths. Its like when you come to see our band play, everything that you hear is being performed nothing is on tracks, absolutely nothing. None of this would be possible if we didn't add that extra player to the band & get the specifically the people we have in the band, everybody thats in the band is a very intentional decision and plays and does everything and beyond that anybody that used to be apart of the band. This is like everybody is maxed out their total potential, like the bass player he doesn't just play bass. He plays bass and he sings now so that shows all their talent and puts their all into the show. The lead guitar doesn't just play leads he also does the synthesizer stuff as well. So everyones like augmented to their fullest potential were as before the band just did one thing each so now everyone is now multitasking. It just makes the band sound so much better then they ever did or ever could.   12. In the teaser video posted on your Facebook page back on August 19th, What is coming soon? What is in store for Breaking Benjamin's future?  Well I think its just more albums, more touring, more shows. At that point like back then it was coming soon but now we played the two shows, the bands back. The coming soon was The bands making a comeback and those two shows we played. So here we are. It turned from like coming soon to the whole BBisBACK thing. The band is pretty much going so anything thats expected of a band is coming from us soon and thats what were going to be doing."
BreakingBenjamin,2hjybc,Careocyn,1 point,Fri Sep 26 21:48:30 2014 UTC,"13. When creating music, What comes first the recording of the instruments and then you write out the lyrics to go with it? Or do you write the lyrics then record to match with that?  Well thats one thing thats pretty much remained the same ever since I was 15 years old I have had the same exact formula and that is I sit down with an acoustic guitar and I write the song. We have a really strict version of what the song is to us and the song is whatever you sit down and you could play on an acoustic guitar its not like a little lead part or a bridge part or anything like that. Its what you could sit down and you can play and sing from the beginning to the end. That’s like the guts and the foundation to the song and thats how it all starts. Either me, Keith, Aaron or really anybody now, cause they're all great writers. We or I would sit down and would write a song on an acoustic guitar and it'll be chords or a riff but it would be the song, it would be the verse, chorus, or the bridge or whatever. Then it varies, I would either write the riff around it or write the technical parts around it and turn it into a rock song or an acoustic song or whatever. Nows these guys are just phenomenal writers and phenomenal musicians so thats something that I really cant say about anyone thats been in the band in the past, they kind of just never really contributed that much as far as that concern and what they did contribute it was not very much along the lines of things that I would expect. It just didn't fall into what Breaking Benjamin is about. So I never really had the luxury of having what I have now. There is a song that we have called “Lights Out” that Jasen actually wrote on the guitar player in the band now, he actually wrote on that song and I basically was strumming the key of the song and said here is the BPM (beats per minute) which is how fast the song is and heres the key the song is in and he sent back to me that riff that you here when the song first starts like Ben then beat boxing the intro beat he wrote that I didn't write that. He writes so much like me that people thought that I wrote it but I straighten them out right away and say no I didn't write it Jasen did but you know its stuff like that. I would never in a million years be able to have that with the other people in the band in the past. I tried but I would never get back what the song needed from the past member but now thats how the new process could go like instead of having to sit on the acoustic and write it all out myself vocals and instruments and riffs. Now I don't have to do that we can do it together but it all starts with the base song cause if you didn't have that base you don't have anything. Without the song there is no solo to play to. So the solo is not important the solo could be a thousand different things without the song to play the solo on you have nothing. So those things we don't sweat we just try to write the song just really good thats the most important part.  14. How would you say Breaking Benjamin evolved musically since the release of your debut album Saturate back in 2002? Would you say your back and better then ever?  Well I think there is definitely an evolution of Breaking Benjamin and since I kind of wrote all of that I could hear saturate and other album in a way that other people cant cause its got a lot more complicated and its got a lot more going with it. In saturate their would be a riff part that I would sing over and compare to now there would be the same thing but would be like another lead guitar line over that and it just makes the song sound totally different but the meat of the song is still there. Same thing with a lot of other bands too like if you listen to Chevelle’s first album versus Wonder Whats Next or the type of thinking or whatever you could hear kind of the same thing where they were just kind of figuring stuff out with the first one and then took it to the next level and same for us then once we get or find a comfort zone of what we sound like and comfortable with ourselves as singer and songwriters we kind of just try to make that the best that it could possibly be, I have never been interested in doing something different just for the sake of doing something different but to make it better. I only want to do something different if its better and not just to do something different. If i try something new or i do something new it ya know its for the better of the song not just to be different. So the evolution of the band from Saturate to now is just kind of in the interest of the song. The song is the boss, I'm not the boss the song is the boss a lot of people in the past would get discouraged because their ideas wouldn't make it or whatever but like I'm not the one deciding it the song is one deciding it and it just doesn't fit the song. That is what makes the evolution and thats what makes it sounds what it sounds like its the songs that are being written for it. Like if I had a song it was written like to sound like Saturate, I wouldn't intentionally make it sound that way if it wasn't supposed to sound.   ** Anything you wish to say to your current or soon to be fans? In a nutshell, Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Words cant even expressed all of our gratitude, there just isn't a word that encompasses it. So Thank you from the bottom of our hearts is the only thing I could really think of to even come close to how grateful we are.  I want to thank you for joining us today in this interview and would like to wish you and your wife Rhiannon the best for your new Son to be here in November & We all look forward to your new album and tour to come in the very near future. Thank you man, it was my pleasure and I appreciate the time for you taking the time to talk with me about Breaking Benjamin and thanks for listening!"

BreakingBenjamin,2gbna4,ThisGoesToEleven,13,Sat Sep 13 22:20:44 2014 UTC,They need to quit playing with my emotions. I've been so hyped ever since they did that video teaser a few weeks ago
BreakingBenjamin,2gbna4,brajmoss,8,Sun Sep 14 16:01:40 2014 UTC,It's not playing with emotions at this point.  IT'S HAPPENING!
BreakingBenjamin,2gbna4,bejoe905,1 point,Sun Sep 14 17:14:49 2014 UTC,Is it the original crew or did Ben find new musicians to play with him?
BreakingBenjamin,2gbna4,Nyxtro,1 point,Wed Nov 19 16:13:57 2014 UTC,"No more Chad, Aaron and Mark. There are four new members: Shaun Foist (drums), Aaron Bruch (bass), Keith Wallen (guitar), Jasen Rauch (lead guitar) and there's still Ben, obviously."
BreakingBenjamin,2gbna4,Nyxtro,1 point,Wed Nov 19 19:49:01 2014 UTC,"Am I wrong to feel a little bitter about the whole situation? The band broke up for such minuscule reasons, Ben suing his own band members and shit all over a guest vocalist on a greatest hits album, now all of a sudden he's back with new guys and we're just supposed to be loyal fans?"
BreakingBenjamin,2gbna4,Nyxtro,1 point,Wed Nov 19 19:59:37 2014 UTC,If we are to believe other people more well connected to the old band then the Greatest Hits album was just the straw that broke the camel's back - the break-up has been a long time coming.  It's up to you whether you feel aggrieved by what happened - I just want some new music.
BreakingBenjamin,2fx7p5,Phobiass,8,Tue Sep 9 17:05:31 2014 UTC,"I hope they get back to their original stuff, with the rawness and heaviness of Saturate. I loved how Tool-esque their first music sounded like."
BreakingBenjamin,2fx7p5,fezzo,7,Wed Sep 10 13:08:48 2014 UTC,"Guitars, drums, bass and singing is my top 4 so far."
BreakingBenjamin,2fx7p5,Leeham721,4,Tue Sep 9 21:26:55 2014 UTC,"I'm personal hoping for more music with ambience involved, for example, ""Blow Me Away,"" ""You Fight Me,"" and ""What Lies Beneath."" I always think they have the best/ most unique sound when they involve those"
BreakingBenjamin,2fx7p5,the213,6,Tue Sep 9 17:07:41 2014 UTC,"Dark atmosphere like You Fight Me for a few songs but mostly We Are Not Alone/Phobia style lyrics. I'd also like a song like Hopeless where Ben really lets out the screams. But if he can't do that, I'm perfectly fine with those haunting ""Whoa""s we heard in the trailer. All in all, I want what they're good at: Moody, atmospheric, dark, meaningful, badass music.  Oh, and more progressive intros like Phase, So Cold and Diary of Jane. Damn good stuff,"
BreakingBenjamin,2fx7p5,SaggitariutJeferspin,3,Tue Sep 9 23:09:43 2014 UTC,"Personally, I just trust Ben to put out a great product. It's safe to say that with the hiatus, he's been writing a hell of a lot. Given the amount of time, I would think he's got more than an album's worth of great music already written."
BreakingBenjamin,2fx7p5,Ibitemyfingernails,3,Sun Sep 21 21:38:34 2014 UTC,I'd love to see the band out out a 2 part album like Stone Sour did with House of Gold & Bones.
BreakingBenjamin,2fx7p5,wingzfan99,5,Sun Sep 21 23:20:10 2014 UTC,I'm not trying to get all personal and awkward.. But..   Dear Agony released shortly after my mom passed away. That album has a special place in my heart and will forever be one of my favorites.   Hopefully they keep the progression going. It seems to me each album gets more and more personal. Dear Agony being the most personal.
BreakingBenjamin,2fx7p5,Matt_Zackmann,3,Sat Oct 18 21:08:13 2014 UTC,"I'm looking for a little less Dear Agony and a little more We Are Not Alone. Not sure why, but DA just didn't do it for me."
BreakingBenjamin,2fx7p5,9200DaystoFreedom,2,Tue Sep 9 19:48:14 2014 UTC,"WANA is my favorite album in every way. If they did a song like WANA with Phobia and DA's darkness/ deeper times guitars, I think it would be perfect."

BreakingBenjamin,2fx7p5,Symtex123,2,Fri Sep 12 18:18:25 2014 UTC,Something similar to the Dear Agony album.   Actually I think I would enjoy a mix of Phobia and Dear Agony.
BreakingBenjamin,2ehsxt,VisforMax,11,Mon Aug 25 02:12:49 2014 UTC,Forget It and Rain.  Every rocker has his soft side.
BreakingBenjamin,2ehsxt,Leeham721,4,Mon Aug 25 03:21:06 2014 UTC,Fun fact:  This song was inspired by Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind
BreakingBenjamin,2ehsxt,arielmayer,3,Mon Aug 25 06:33:19 2014 UTC,"Plenty of love here. When I first got into BB I only listened to their harder material and after hearing about 10 seconds of Forget It, I literally did forget about it for years. Then I re-listened to it, and the song was so poignant; so full of emotion that I wondered how I didn't love it earlier.  Now if you'll excuse me I have the sudden urge to play this right now, and make sure my neighbours hear it too."
BreakingBenjamin,2ehsxt,fezzo,3,Mon Aug 25 04:14:18 2014 UTC,There's also a radio edit of Forget It that a lot of people probably don't know about. Give it a listen!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysJxBWbgQzg

Of course, it, along with ""Follow"" and ""Rain"" were all co-written by Billy Corgan, so it does make perfect sense."

BreakingBenjamin,2e2qqp,fezzo,3,Wed Aug 20 12:32:11 2014 UTC,"So I got in a bit of a creative mood after hearing the new teaser, and I loved the dark sound and Ben's haunting vocals. I sort of tried to replicate that feel in a couple of mock album covers with possible names, following the style of their previous 4 albums. Coming up with an album name is pretty hard actually, lol :|"

BreakingBenjamin,2e148t,bradderz958,10,Tue Aug 19 23:18:14 2014 UTC,"The only new member I am familiar with is Jasen Rauch. He used to be in the band RED, and was a principle songwriter for the band. Even after leaving the band as a touring musician he continued to write for the band and is considered an unofficial member. He has also worked with Breaking Benjamin in the past, co-writing ""I Will Not Bow"" on the Dear Agony album. I believe he left RED after their second album, so check out End of Silence and Innocence and Instinct to hear some of his previous work."
BreakingBenjamin,2e148t,Lilcheeks,5,Tue Aug 19 23:39:45 2014 UTC,"I had no idea. RED was great on their first two albums so I'm really glad to here that, thanks for the information. What little I heard of the teaser gave me goosebumps. I've never been disappointed with BB and I don't think I will be on this one either!"
BreakingBenjamin,2e148t,Phobiass,2,Tue Aug 19 23:42:17 2014 UTC,Yea I got chills watching that last night. So excited. I've never seen them do a normal live show however I did get to see one of Ben's acoustic shows which was incredible. One of the best shows I've ever attended.
BreakingBenjamin,2e148t,Backfjre,2,Wed Aug 20 14:34:38 2014 UTC,"Wallen was from the band ""Adelitas Way"" and they're in my top 5, though BB holds the number 1 spot. He's a great guitarist and great back up singer. I can't wait to see what he brings to the table."
BreakingBenjamin,2e148t,jfincher,2,Wed Aug 20 01:51:43 2014 UTC,"I went to a Red Concert a few years back. They did one song specifically that was amazing live. Death of Me, just passed the 2 minute mark there is a part where the lead guitarist and lead singer scream back and forth at eachother, it was incredible.  I'm not sure if Jasen Rauch was still in the band, I forget what year it was, but if he happened to sing that part for RED, I'd be excited if he can bring some interesting vocals to BB too.  Regardless, I think BB will benefit from having him."
BreakingBenjamin,2e148t,yourmindin3D,9,Wed Aug 20 07:13:20 2014 UTC,So very extremely pumped!  Has it really been five years since the last album already!?  Almost to the day.  Wow...

BreakingBenjamin,2e148t,Jakexx360,4,Wed Aug 20 02:16:45 2014 UTC,Keith Wallen is a former guitarist for Adelita's Way and Jasen Rauch is a former guitarist of Red. I believe the other two guys are simply good friends of Ben that are musicians
BreakingBenjamin,2e148t,metalfan2680,2,Tue Aug 19 23:21:12 2014 UTC,"Shaun Foist on drums, Aaron Bruch, Jasen Rauch and Keith Wallen, with Burnley remaining as lead vocalist.  Found this on Shaun,  http://www.moderndrummer.com/site/2012/03/shaun-foist/  Keith is from Adelitas Way. Score!!  http://loudwire.com/adelitas-way-keith-wallen-exits-band/  Aaron appears to be from some band called ""OurAfter"". I don't know anything more than that.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasen_Rauch  Jasen is from Red. It's worth noting he helped write ""I Will Not Bow"".  Based on what I see, Jasen and Keith are both relatively well known and will definitely fit in here. Shaun and Aaron.. they're kind of a mystery at this point. At the very least, I'm happy with having two familiar faces. You'll notice every single one of these new members has some connection to BB at some point in time."
BreakingBenjamin,2e148t,Jakexx360,2,Tue Aug 19 23:42:50 2014 UTC,"So, is Ben going to be only on vocals or are they gonna do some kind of weird 3 guitarist thing?"
BreakingBenjamin,2e148t,autowikibot,4,Tue Aug 19 23:42:52 2014 UTC,"Ben will probably do a guitar part, and so will one of the others. Then of course you have the bassist and Shaun on drums. If you look at the video, you can probably tell which one is on guitar because Keith is the attractive one and I don't remember if he was holding a bass."

Rauch was previously a member of the band Red , but is still a songwriter for them. He was an original member of the band, founded by Anthony and Randy Armstrong when they moved from Erie, Pennsylvania to Nashville, Tennessee to focus on their career.  Rauch has co-written much of Red's material.  Rauch uses PRS Guitars.   Rauch co-wrote and worked with bands such as Breaking Benjamin, Pillar,  Kerrie Roberts, Brian ""Head"" Welch, Stars Go Dim, Fireflight, 12 Stones, Spoken, Disciple and with Rob Graves in making a score for the film, Into the Darkness.  Rauch contributed to the writing of Breaking Benjamin’s song, ""I Will Not Bow,"" the lead single from Dear Agony.

BreakingBenjamin,2e2g4i,Maccadude33,2,Wed Aug 20 21:56:08 2014 UTC,I would revert it back to just being white. It makes reading easier.
BreakingBenjamin,2e2g4i,brajmoss,1 point,Thu Aug 21 05:48:52 2014 UTC,I'd recommend a black/dark blue background and then have text show up in a white/light blue font.
BreakingBenjamin,2e2g4i,brajmoss,1 point,Thu Aug 21 05:38:23 2014 UTC,Awesome job! I would definitely keep the top black area. Maybe replace the Saturate background to a black background with the BB symbol. Looks great otherwise!

BreakingBenjamin,293psg,IowaFarmboy,4,Thu Jun 26 04:58:10 2014 UTC,"Breaking Benjamin:       Breaking Benjamin is an American rock band from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, currently fronted by vocalist and guitarist Benjamin Burnley. The band released four studio albums, Saturate in 2002, We Are Not Alone in 2004, Phobia in 2006, and Dear Agony in 2009, selling over five million albums in the United States.   In mid-2010, the band started a hiatus due to frontman Burnley's recurring illnesses and inability to tour. Further complications arose in August 2011 when Mark Klepaski and Aaron Fink were fired from the band.  In April 2013, Burnley announced he would press forward with the band name in the future without any of the other previous members, as drummer Chad Szeliga announced his departure from the band.

I, for one, have a hard time listening to a bands earlier works if I start further along in their catalog - not because the earlier stuff is worse, but rather because the more current content is a much more refined product that came from years of work and experimentation.

BreakingBenjamin,1wrnzi,autotune-mexican,2,Sun Feb 2 02:35:40 2014 UTC,Believe me that song put me through the last 4 months of my high school years. I would use the song as the anthem of those days.
BreakingBenjamin,1wrnzi,UnsinkableRubberDuck,8,Sun Feb 2 06:31:39 2014 UTC,"I have to pick just one?!  Inconceivable!  I can narrow it down to two.  First, Breath.  I have a special attachment to that song.  It's a really good song, and I love it for its content, but I was responsible for the first time it was ever played on the air in the United Kingdom, too, and that's pretty cool.  There's a rock/alternative radio station in the UK called Kerrang, and there is/was a DJ (Luke Wilkins) who would do a feature on Friday mornings at 11am called Please Release Me.  Listeners could email in a request for him to play a song, any song, as long as it had never been released as a single in the UK.  He would pick a new one each week and talk about it.  One week he picked my email!  Only I had been able to decide which song I liked the best, since they'd never had any songs released over there, I gave him a short list of my favourites, and he picked Breath.  After that, occasionally other songs got played, too, like Diary of Jane.  Pretty awesome stuff.  I also really like Home.  The final part, ""I don't wanna be bold, I don't wanna be cold, I don't wanna grow old, I wanna go home!""  That's always struck a chord with me, since I discovered Breaking Benjamin when I was living far away from home, on my own, with no family or friends."

BreakingBenjamin,1wrnzi,Hamlet7768,5,Sun Feb 2 07:14:30 2014 UTC,The Diary of Jane. It is INSANELY catchy and has the most fascinating subtext I've encountered in a BB song.
BreakingBenjamin,1wrnzi,Msdup,2,Sun Feb 2 02:12:34 2014 UTC,"""... has the most fascinating subtext I've encountered in a BB song.""   What do you mean by subtext?"
BreakingBenjamin,1wrnzi,Hamlet7768,10,Sun Feb 2 02:37:39 2014 UTC,"Ideas and narrative that are implied rather than explicitly stated. For example, in The Diary of Jane:   If I had to//I would put myself right beside you//...//and I don't mind//if you say this love is the last time   Says a lot about the speaker, that he's doesn't really mind if his relationship to Jane ends forever.   I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane   A diary...a collection of a person's thoughts. Jane's thoughts. He wants to find out where he fits in Jane's mind, in her life. How does she regard him?   Desperate I will crawl//waiting for so long//no love//there is no love   Whoa. All this work trying to find a place in Jane's life, and it's all for nothing?   As I burn another page//as I look the other way   Burn another page of the diary? Why's he burning Jane's diary?   Something's getting in the way//Something's just about to break   That's an interesting way of putting it. Is Jane in the way? Is her diary in the way? Is he burning it to ""break"" it, get it out of the way?   Die for anyone//what have I become?   And yet he goes right back to burning the pages, trying to find a place in the diary of Jane. What has he become indeed."

BreakingBenjamin,1vu7su,unlinkedcody,9,Wed Jan 22 08:44:31 2014 UTC,"From early 2010 to July 2013 they were completely on hiatus because of a lawsuit between Benjamin Burnley (Singer/writer/guitarist) and Aaron fink (Guitarist)/Mark Kelpaski (Bassist). The lawsuit was because of the newer version of ""Blow Me Away"" featuring valora. He didn't want to do it and said it didn't meet his standards as a song writer. Then mark and Aaron released it without his permission, along with the greatest of album, so he fired them. Then the lawsuit started. It ended this July with Ben winning the rights to the band name. Then while Breaking Ben was on hiatus, Chad Szeliga (drummer) toured an played with Black label Society. Since they supported him for so long he decided to stay with them and left Breaking Ben. Now the bands only current member is Ben. Within the past couple months he out up 2 acoustic videos on the bands page and did 2 (I think) acoustic bar shows."

BreakingBenjamin,1tqo3o,ender008,2,Thu Mar 20 03:29:55 2014 UTC,"Ben wrote most of the material and Aron, Chad, and Mark just added their little flavor over his recordings. So it'll be pretty much the same, with a little more or less Ben depending on what the new members do.

He plans to continue releasing music under the name Breaking Benjamin.   Is dear agony about something that the band went through?    I like this explanation of the album the best:  ""To me, if you listen to the whole album in order, the whole album is story about someone dying. There seems to be different people's points of view. Some people love the person dying, some people do not.  In the first song, it's the person dying who's speaking. At first the person is tired of the pain and tired of all the struggle and is slowly dying. They just want it all to end. But then, as seen by the second verse, at the same time they do not want to die. The have something in this world still worth fighting for. The person questions why they are in the state they are in and at the end basically screams for the agony to let him go and by the last line of the song it seems it does. The next song Into The Nothing also lets us assume that the person is either dead or is at the moment of death."""

When the album first came out I just loved it because I loved bb, and didn't pay attention to the lyrics. Years later when I got divorced, that album spoke to me, and made me cry, and I truly believe it was one of the more important things that helped me through that tough time. I don't remember the name of the song but the lyrics ""I forgive you, forget you, the end"" always puts me in tears."
BreakingBenjamin,1j7ux9,bradderz958,2,Fri Nov 8 15:59:21 2013 UTC,"I think my two favourites are Home and Breath, those two in particular connect with me.  Though, the main reason why I love BB so much is because I can find a deep connection with a lot of their songs, even in different situations in my life.  There's always something to make me feel very attached to the lyrics and the amazing music."
BreakingBenjamin,1ivkms,arielmayer,7,Tue Jul 23 10:33:19 2013 UTC,I gotta go with We Are Not Alone. Perfect blend of the rawness of Saturate with the melody of Phobia.
BreakingBenjamin,1ivkms,TH3Z0MB13G0D,5,Tue Jul 23 10:34:12 2013 UTC,Its gotta be Dear Agony for me.
BreakingBenjamin,1ivkms,HrBingR,2,Tue Jul 23 16:47:31 2013 UTC,Agreed!
BreakingBenjamin,1ivkms,UnsinkableRubberDuck,1 point,Wed Jul 24 04:31:04 2013 UTC,"I'm torn between Saturate and Dear Agony, it's too hard to choose!"
BreakingBenjamin,1ivkms,TH3Z0MB13G0D,2,Tue Jul 23 23:19:54 2013 UTC,Dear Agony is a bit more emotional and poetic.
BreakingBenjamin,1ivkms,Neurotrace,2,Wed Jul 24 16:28:07 2013 UTC,We Are Not Alone is perfect. I can still turn that album on at anytime and listen to it on repeat.
BreakingBenjamin,1ivkms,nickyty123,4,Wed Nov 6 03:49:57 2013 UTC,"Great question! I love them all. It's great to see how their style developed from Saturate to Dear Agony. I have favourite tracks, but I can't settle for a favourite album.   But We Are Not Alone is great, not least because of So Cold. The acoustic version is amazing too."
BreakingBenjamin,1ivkms,Ibitemyfingernails,3,Tue Jul 23 19:11:54 2013 UTC,I love phobia..saturate is a little too rough around the edges for me but i enjoy in nonetheless...dear agony i think is their most developed work but i cant get over my aww when listening to diary of jane for the first time.
BreakingBenjamin,1ivkms,RogueHippie,3,Wed Jul 24 01:53:08 2013 UTC,Dear Agony for me.  It released a few months after my mom passed away.  It always seemed like the lyrics were written about my life
BreakingBenjamin,1ivkms,1etsstartover,2,Thu Nov 7 23:05:35 2013 UTC,"If I had to pick one, I'd say Saturate. The rawness of that album is what made me start listening to hard rock."

BreakingBenjamin,1eeqsu,arielmayer,1 point,Thu May 16 12:20:22 2013 UTC,Very well done! Perchance do you deliver? :D
BreakingBenjamin,1dzy7e,Soviet_Russia321,2,Thu May 9 13:05:24 2013 UTC,Interesting that you chose such an unpopular song to represent a band that you're recommending.  The lead singer's voice is a little rough in a way that I don't like but in general it's pretty good.
BreakingBenjamin,1dzy7e,arielmayer,0,Sun May 12 17:48:41 2013 UTC,Unpopular? Everyone I know that's heard this song can't wait for the new CD.
BreakingBenjamin,1dzy7e,HrBingR,0,Mon May 13 23:39:00 2013 UTC,"Okay wait, I'm highly confused, especially since I don't have a Google music store here where I am. Is this a breaking benjamin song? If so, why can I find nothing about it online?"
BreakingBenjamin,1dzy7e,arielmayer,2,Wed Jun 5 23:23:27 2013 UTC,"No, it's a song that OP thought we would like by a different band."
BreakingBenjamin,1dzy7e,HrBingR,1 point,Thu Jun 6 04:04:10 2013 UTC,Ah no wonder.
BreakingBenjamin,1dzy7e,HrBingR,1 point,Thu Jun 6 06:10:50 2013 UTC,It's the lead single off of Skillets new album.
BreakingBenjamin,1dzy7e,Skmidge,1 point,Thu Jun 20 00:38:42 2013 UTC,Okay shit I like Skillet too. Let's go try it.
BreakingBenjamin,1d4kba,Soviet_Russia321,2,Fri Apr 26 01:57:19 2013 UTC,"Probably my favorite album right now. Since I started listening to them I've been moving down the albums. Dear Agony was my favorite, then Phobia, and now We Are Not Alone. Eventually I'll probably move on to Saturate."
BreakingBenjamin,1d4kba,arielmayer,0,Fri Apr 26 13:24:38 2013 UTC,"I did nazi that coming, sagan bless you! Have all my upvotes! My reaction to your comment"
BreakingBenjamin,1d4kba,AerateMark,4,Fri Apr 26 13:24:43 2013 UTC,"Oh my god, your account is genius. You are a living, breathing circlejerk and it gets you shitloads of karma. Just by repeating all the commonly-used phrases on reddit. Enjoy my downvote you brilliant bastard.  15000 link karma and almost 20000 comment karma in 7 months!"
BreakingBenjamin,1cvvi4,arielmayer,8,Mon Apr 22 20:12:45 2013 UTC,I know I'll probably get a bunch of downvotes for this... but it seems like Ben is kind of hurting himself as a musician by severing ties with all his members like that. He did the same with Jeremy.
BreakingBenjamin,1cvvi4,metalfan2680,2,Tue Apr 23 03:35:27 2013 UTC,"No, you're right. The business with Jeremy was before I discovered BB so I don't know what it was all about, but kicking Mark and Aaron out like this over an unauthorised remix... I don't know, I guess I would be frustrated in his stead too but I wouldn't have deemed it worth a 2 year long legal feud and severing ties with two friends."
BreakingBenjamin,1cvvi4,metalfan2680,7,Sun Apr 28 20:25:08 2013 UTC,"No, not at all. If I were in his position I would be pretty upset that they remade a song that I wrote without my permission, but I wouldn't go so far as to throw them into a huge legal battle and completely sever ties with them. And if we're honest, the remix wasn't even good."
BreakingBenjamin,1cvvi4,MJB24,1 point,Mon Apr 29 00:03:14 2013 UTC,"IIRC, he even encouraged fans not to buy the Best Of album. Between that, kicking the other members out and suing them, seems like he might have overracted just a little."
BreakingBenjamin,1cvvi4,metalfan2680,0,Mon Apr 29 19:40:54 2013 UTC,"Wow, really? Honestly I have the Best Of and I really like it. The remasters are pretty decent, their cover of Enjoy the Silence is amazing and the two acoustic songs are really good. Man. I'm kinda starting to lose respect for BB. :/"
BreakingBenjamin,1cvvi4,SgtShadow,3,Tue Apr 30 01:45:59 2013 UTC,Damn it! Probably going to be a while before we get any music at all them :/ I'm just glad I got to see them all live before they ended it :(  EDIT: Checked out Stardog Champion for Aaron and Mark... Not bad. I like it. But I still want some new BB.
BreakingBenjamin,1cvvi4,UnsinkableRubberDuck,6,Tue Apr 23 02:08:51 2013 UTC,"I'm just glad I got to see them all live before they ended it :(   God dammit.  I didn't get that chance.  This really blows, Breaking Benjamin is my favourite :/"
BreakingBenjamin,1cvvi4,rageaholic55,3,Tue Apr 23 06:59:26 2013 UTC,"I nearly passed on them last time because I was a poor college student and figured ""Oh, they'll be back in a year or two""... Wow did I luck out!"
BreakingBenjamin,1cvvi4,UnsinkableRubberDuck,2,Tue Apr 23 22:02:42 2013 UTC,There's not a lot I wouldn't do for tickets to one of their shows.
BreakingBenjamin,1cvvi4,IowaFarmboy,1 point,Tue Apr 23 22:57:53 2013 UTC,I did that. They came by the lonely state of Iowa when I was a sophomore in high school. And I PASSED. Fuck.
BreakingBenjamin,1cp6b5,Dred363,6,Fri Apr 19 20:54:13 2013 UTC,This is great to hear. A very underrated band.
