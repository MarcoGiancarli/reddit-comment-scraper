genderqueer,3e4jat,tmamone,18,Tue Jul 21 22:11:51 2015 UTC,"If it helps you at all, consider that that bathroom can be used by people with all kinds of conditions considered to be disabilities.  Sure, someone in a wheelchair may not be physically able to use the gendered restrooms with narrow stalls, so obviously that bathroom is for them.  However, someone with a colostomy bag might just want a bit more privacy, and most people wouldn't begrudge them that even if they might be physically capable of using the other facilities.  Similarly, if you feel you need more privacy in the restroom, you're no more rude for using the unisex one than anyone else who needs more privacy, regardless of the reason."
genderqueer,3e4jat,gendersuspender,9,Tue Jul 21 22:38:17 2015 UTC,"Get in and get out. If you feel safer there than gendered restroom, it is for you. It is sweet to think of others, just don't loiter in there."
genderqueer,3e4jat,Talga_Vassternich,9,Tue Jul 21 22:17:40 2015 UTC,Use the unisex bathroom. You have as much right to be there as they do since there aren't any other gender neutral restrooms around.
genderqueer,3e4jat,Voiddreamer,4,Tue Jul 21 22:20:00 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's not reserved for people with disabilites and for families, it's accessible for them. Just don't loiter and no one can say anything."

I would never ever say anything because I always always ALWAYS give apparently able-bodied people the benefit of the doubt with disabled restrooms.   The ONLY situation where using a handicapped restroom is a breach of etiquette is if there are MULTIPLE stalls available and you choose the handicapped one, or if you are playing on your cell phone in the handicapped stall while you see I'm waiting.   You are fine. Do what feels right and safe."

In order of proximity to the entrance to the hallway they are : ""Family"", "" Men"", ""Women"". My mother always used the family bathroom because it was closest, despite her and I both being cis women. Obviously it is a bit tangential to your question, but for what it's worth with situations like that nobody bats an eyelash at anyone being in there."
genderqueer,3e2t8v,spooprfluid,8,Tue Jul 21 15:00:30 2015 UTC,"Sorry if this isn't exactly relevant, but I feel the exact same way in reverse. (Afab that would rather be feminine in an amab body.) You could maybe try using mascara or very light ""natural"" makeup to emphasize feminine parts of your face while also having a more androgynous haircut maybe? Wearing a sports bra w/o cups could also help since it mimics binding. Sorry if that isn't super helpful :( I mainly want to express that you're not alone w/ cross-gender feelings stuff. xoxo  Edit: Sorry for all of the makeup-related thing but I personally tweeze/shape my brows for femme days and then fill them in w/ brow filler and a brush on masculine days."
genderqueer,3e2t8v,josie29,3,Tue Jul 21 15:37:23 2015 UTC,I feel exactly the way you do every day.  So I just try and be as feminine and confusing to everyone as possible.
genderqueer,3e2t8v,Talga_Vassternich,3,Tue Jul 21 15:39:47 2015 UTC,"This is me in many ways, especially when I was starting and not comfortable with being nonbinary but I am further along.  I identify with  genderqueer-neutrois because I am medically transitioning to kill masculine traits but only minimal estrogen (2MG).  About nine month in I have lost about thirty pounds of muscle and can shift my appearance between male and female with clothing and hair.  I feel fluid between transfeminine and neutral so passing is not so much a goal as I do prefer they/their.  I find I am MUCH happier with my body and can embrace the versatility of being less masculine. I can wake up to put on a skirt and flats or dress skater ""male"".  If it wasn't for the world being so binary and invalidating, I would be ecstatic with my choices in transition.  Not I am just super happy."
genderqueer,3e2t8v,ThrownAwayWoman,3,Tue Jul 21 16:34:59 2015 UTC,Agreed. My ideal body is female that can pass as male given the right clothes and haircut. I'd kill for a male body that could in any conceivable way pass as female though.
genderqueer,3e2t8v,notallthatrelevant,2,Tue Jul 21 17:32:53 2015 UTC,"I experienced pretty similar feelings, I ended up seeing a counselor and I start hormones this week.  That general unease and discomfort started really getting to me, to the point that I was vocally complaining about it one day and a friend was just like ""dude, transition if you dislike being a guy so much.""  I won't lie, it was super scary and still is, but it's better than living a life of hating my body, so that ended up being the best option for me personally.  I'm not saying that's necessarily the path you need to to take, but it's at least something to consider.   In your situation, I'd try to scrutinize that discomfort as thoroughly as you can manage.  Feelings are complicated, and it could be that there is a less drastic route you can take to being more comfortable.  Counseling would help with this, but if you don't have access to a decent gender counselor I'd recommend hitting up /r/asktransgender and picking some folks brains over there.  I've only been at this for about a year, and there are lots of people who are way more experienced and able to to help than I am."
genderqueer,3e2t8v,F3mshep,2,Tue Jul 21 15:42:59 2015 UTC,"This is very similiar to how I feel, I want to approach androgyny from a women's perspective, not a man's. I am on HRT so I can. I vary more between feeling agender and a woman, but I do have my boy days every now and then."
genderqueer,3e2t8v,Philae_90,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:40:14 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way except I switch between wanting an AFAB and AMAB body (I'm AFAB). I wish my body had more versatility but really I wish I could swap freely.  I think /u/Babeholdt has a good idea when they mentioned mimicking binding. By doing that, maybe even adding padding so it looks like you're unable to bind to be fully flat-chested, sadly the problem I have. :(  So maybe mimic things we do as AFAB people to try to look more androgynous or masculine and deliberately present yourself as failing slightly? Maybe to give people the sense that you're actually an AFAB person trying to look more masculine presenting.  I don't really have much to offer, sorry. But you're not alone in your feelings."
genderqueer,3e2t8v,Kat_Rogue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:57:28 2015 UTC,Some genderfluid folks go full back and forth like suits to dresses and feel comfortable in it all. My most comfortable boymode is basically what a tomboy would wear. Distinctly masculine clothing irks me. I prefer going from full femme to androgynous (but I'd rather be an androgynous GIRL is the thing). Feels ya.
genderqueer,3e2t8v,tiffanyjoXD,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:06:53 2015 UTC,"This sounds a lot like me...like, a lot. I'm AMAB, and I identify more as genderfluid girl than a genderfluid boy. I want to have a more girly body, more curvy, smallish boobs, stuff like that. I have days that I don't mind being seen as a guy on some days, but other days, I wish I could just be seen a girl.  I also feel like I'm slowly opening up to being more pansexual myself, like I'm attracted to femininity, but I no longer feel like I want to operate strictly in a ""just women"" approach to sexuality, more ""feminine traits""."
genderqueer,3e2t8v,ZanSquid,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:27:21 2015 UTC,"I feel exactly the same from the other direction, so I definitely get it. I'm seriously looking into transition so that I can mess with gender norms from the other side, so to speak, but I'm second-guessing myself a lot. Is it what I really want? Do I just think I want it, and if I had it I would want something else? What if it really is just a phase, and then I do something permanent?  So sorry, no advice. I'm still trying to figure it out myself. But thanks for posting; it helps to know I'm not alone at least :)"
genderqueer,3e2t8v,lavender_sage,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:02:17 2015 UTC,"I most definitely feel that way. AMAB, in high school distinctly remember wanting a female body. When I finally found the words for my feeling it was much more of a ""I don't know what I am but it isn't male"" than it was ""I'm a woman"". So I'd guess I'm demigirl or something transfeminine that's not entirely woman. I'd say as much as 60% of my gender feels like it's not male or female; and the idea of gender as a thing that dictates what I should like or dislike seems ridiculous. I'd love to go out in a suit or tux en homme once in a while...but as a female-bodied individual underneath. I'm currently transitioning, trying to get as much lost hair back as possible, etc.   Advice wise, ""ask your doctor about estrogen, see what it can do for you"" ;-) I value estrogen most for what it does to my mind. You might find tweaking your hormone chemistry has a powerful effect on finding your artistic voice and expression."

I just wish that I'd been born about 10 years younger, i would have probably come to terms with my gender much sooner and probably not the nearly 20 years of testosterone poisoning that has given me a masculine form that I'm not comfortable in. I also wish I lived in a country that has like 14 month waiting lists to be seen by a GIC and a requirement of a 2 year RLT before even considering you for being ready for hormones."

I mostly just get Target brand light liners. The packaging is kinda feminine (edge of skirt, flowers, purse, etc.) but they're color coded to absorbency levels. It's not aggressively girly girl girl and doesn't make me roll my eyes, like this box of PINK! PINK! GRRL POWA!! did.  I'm also happy with their hiring policies. Like, they're still a megacorporation with iffy overseas policies and overwork their workers. But that's sort of par for the course, sadly. On the positive side, my local Targets have hired people that present as non-binary, including some androgynous folk, people with traditionally feminine bodies and well-groomed facial hair, and even a genderfluid worker who switches from boy mode to girl mode (they have distinct dyed hair).  I have also noticed - at least in my local stores - they stopped using gendered terms (ma'am, sir, ladies, guys, etc.) and use neutral ones (friend, guest, folks, y'all, etc.) Makes me smile broadly."

Point out that they're invalidating your identity by calling it a phase, the same way unsupportive family members might invalidate the identity of a binary trans person by calling it a phase.  Your partner will need to learn to respect your identity as equally valid to their own, even if it's something that was a phase for them.    Also, I know a lot of trans people who were hella binary from the start and didn't have a non-binary exploration phase, as well as some who started out 100% binary identified and came to understand themselves as non-binary post-transition.  I'm sure you can dig up examples from the blogosphere to support your argument if it comes to that, but your partner should really take your word anyway."

I thought I was ""just a cross-dresser"" and that I wouldn't need to after marriage. Well, that was wrong. Later, with a daughter approaching puberty, I finally reached the tipping point, was finally able to mentally separate the ""female envy"" from the female attraction, and voila!, hello trans lesbian.   what were your experiences with that process?   ""OMG! How did I not see this sooner?! OMG! What do I do now?"" Expletives. Repeat. Repeat again. Repeat some more. Lots of research.  I'm out to my wife (""I'm not sure how to tell you this, but [blurt]""), some immediate family members (on the phone, unplanned, right after), and a couple of friends (by phone, later).

Should have had this sorted out when I was a kid, but I grew up in a conservative religious family.

Like you, I'm sure I can track back a lot of this stuff to earlier in my life, but the real real questioning started this year...   If you realized you were genderqueer as an adult, what were your experiences with that process?   I'm trying to build community around it, it's not something I have. I'm fortunate to live in an area populated by lots of Queers like me and to have been in some of that as a total 'mo, so I have the language and connections that are making it easier to feel supported as I slowly come out (I'm announcing things step by step because I have that support).   Did you come out? How did you navigate that?   Yep! My friends were easy, mostly, lots of folks who already know lots of trans* and GQ/GF folks. Family has been tougher, but I haven't tried to really announce it or change anything yet, so I think it's palatable right now. We'll see what happens when I tell them I want to start T...

genderqueer,3dt8pb,alugura,2,Sun Jul 19 05:57:23 2015 UTC,"A side note: We are who we identify as. So a ""woman identifying as a man"" would technically describe a multi-gender person. But if, for example, a person assigned female at birth identifies as a man, he then is a man, simply as that.   Also; usually, it's 'cisgender', not 'cissexual'. Most neutrois people I know feel like they fit somewhere in the trans spectrum but if a neutrois person tells me they're cis then of course I believe them.   As far as further detailing your attraction, panromantic sounds pretty accurate, and maybe multisexual or polysexual besides that. Presentation isn't the same as gender, it's just one part of it, so it would be slightly problematic to label your preferences for genderqueer-presenting women (and trans masculine people?) under sexual orientation as such. After all, people may be non-binary and not visibly present as such, and people may also be binary and present ambiguously."

genderqueer,3dpfmv,pomade4,10,Sat Jul 18 04:30:19 2015 UTC,"For some people, things like pronouns are a really big deal. Unfortunately we are all trained from birth to sort people into categories of ""boy"" and ""girl"". It's possible to get your presentation to a point where people might be confused about your gender, but even then they will settle on one or the other. Only in trans-friendly spaces does anyone ask for your pronouns or not assume your gender immediately, and even then it can be hit or miss depending on the space. In my experience, when someone reflexively uses ""her"" like that, it is a reminder that people will keep seeing you as a girl no matter how much you express yourself. I can be pretty androgynous at times and even be wearing a binder and the cashier at Dunkin Donuts still calls me ma'am. It's very heavy to think about how you will be fighting the rest of your life to be yourself. I hope I can shed some light on this for you. You sound like a cool partner."

I only really get offended by people using the wrong pronouns if they know my preferences and are doing it deliberately - otherwise, I don't blame the other person for it, but it still feels like the mental equivalent of an elbow in the ribs. And then if I dwell on it, it can give rise to thoughts about never really being able to be seen as my true gender identity, like /u/caretta_caretta said."

genderqueer,3dinq0,Pseutri,13,Thu Jul 16 16:06:45 2015 UTC,"Many of the points you made there make me think that you are, indeed, experiencing gender dysphoria - what label you want to place on your identity (if any) is up to you, but it sounds like 'agender' would describe it quite well.  When it comes to gender being a social construct, I like to use the argument that just because something is socially constructed, that doesn't mean it's any less 'real'. There are many social constructs - for example, language and currency - which are integral to the working of our society, and although there may be no inherent biological basis for them, there are certainly areas of the brain that process them and are influenced by them. Not to mention that they have a huge impact on they way society works, and on individual people's lives. So to me, wondering whether gender is a real thing that people should worry about is a little like wondering whether money is a real thing that people should worry about - it may be a thing that's 'made up', but it's been 'made up' by humanity as a whole rather than individual humans, as have all the problems that can go along with it. I hope that makes sense.   For what it's worth, I do feel like my gender fluidity is something that I would still have if I'd grown up alone on a desert island - but I probably wouldn't associate each gender state with most of the things I associate them with today. Gender identity would be just another one of those weird mental phenomena that people experience, and I wouldn't have a word for it or attach particular significance to it any more than I'd do the same for nostalgia, or dé ja vu, or earworms. But that's just my fairly baseless personal opinion, and I have no way of knowing if it's actually true."
genderqueer,3dinq0,TheNightisYoung,7,Thu Jul 16 16:33:49 2015 UTC,"Has anyone else had these doubts about whether you might be adopting a label for convenience, or, if you agree that gender is mostly a social construct, how do you reconcile that with being genderqueer?   Gender is a social construct as are many other aspects of our identities like nationality, race, class. Its a way to describe the formation of things like statuses in such a way that highlights how the their qualities are not essential. Its a rebuttal to an old philosophical way of thinking about society known as essentialism. It isn't meant to invalidate the existence of our identities , only to show the way culture functions in their formation. I've never felt the need to negate my identity because of the process behind it's formation. Instead, I recognize my gender queer identity as how I describe my relation to societal norms.   Have any of you had your dysphoria skyrocket only after you started questioning, or realized things that made more sense in retrospect?   Yeah, this has happened to me in a few ways. Previously, i hadn't realized how a great deal of the things that bother me are qualities that are gendered as male. Why am i doing things that bother me? socialization. Previously, I used to just think ""hey thats an awful photo because"". Now its ""all those awful photos have my jaw line looking really square. that is something that is male gendered and this is dysphoria.""   My gender, how I do it, and how people read me is also on my mind a lot more as I spend time reading and thinking about it."
genderqueer,3dinq0,flopsflip,5,Thu Jul 16 16:42:33 2015 UTC,"I don't have any answers for you because I'm going through this right now. I also have a really hard time wrapping my head around the idea of gender. I have a friend who is very feminine but amab and is confident in his identity as a man. He hasn't been able to explain what ""being a man"" feels like to him. I'm mostly fine with my body but I'd also be fine with a male one and I get really uncomfortable when people encourage me to join groups that are for women or imply that I should do more feminine things. For now, I'm just trying not to focus on labels but lately I've been wondering if I would be happier ""out""."
genderqueer,3dinq0,isaac_the_robot,5,Thu Jul 16 16:33:03 2015 UTC,"I strongly agree with TheNightisYoung: gender is certainly a social construct, but being aware of this doesn't change the fact that most individuals continue to find their places in this construct, or to find their assigned places in it uncomfortable.   I'm not certain I understand what you mean when you say ""adopting a label for convenience,"" but I took it to mean that you are worried you will be assigning the label ""agender"" to yourself only to discover a few years from now that your confusion was just some sort of phase. My opinion on that is that ""phase"" is merely a derogatory term applied to fluidity. I consider it perfectly valid to go a few years of your life identifying as a certain gender even if that is not the way you identify for the majority of your life. Most children go through ""phases"" in which they try out ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" activities, attire, mannerisms, etc. regardless of whether they grow up to be transgender. Identity is probably the most fluid aspect of human personality, but unfortunately society dictates that it should be firm and fully established by age 10 at the latest....  Sorry for my little rant. My point is, you feel how you feel. If you don't feel that way two years from now, it doesn't mean you were exploiting gender fluidity or being overly self-indulgent. It simply means that the particular path life has led you through brought you to a different place than you predicted, which is what happens to every single human every single day. You're great just the way you are, and just the way you are is whatever you decide :)"

genderqueer,3dinq0,kristendk,5,Thu Jul 16 20:20:26 2015 UTC,"RE: social constructs - Chairs and doctors are also social constructs (in the sense that they are constructed via society), but you don't hear people questioning their existence.  If gender is a social construct, that doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't exist. Even if they're rigid, imperialist, and often inaccurate. Even if they aren't biological. And you exist inside of a culture that wants you to think of yourself as a gendered being, so I think it makes sense that you would want to have words to describe your experiences.  It's also very common for individuals to not ""notice"" gender/social dysphoria until they really start questioning their gender. I guess you can think of it like when you never hear a word until you do, and then you hear it six more times that week, get me?  If identifying as agender makes you feel more comfortable in your body & in your understanding of yourself, why shouldn't you do it?  Basically what everyone else already said."
genderqueer,3dinq0,thevelvetmachine,3,Thu Jul 16 21:59:22 2015 UTC,I'm maab but have similar doubts about gender and myself. Was very strange reading a lot of this coming from someone else. No easy answers but you're not alone in your confusion and doubt!
genderqueer,3dinq0,lathomas64,3,Thu Jul 16 16:39:23 2015 UTC,"I feel much the same way about a lot of things you said. About 95% of your post applies to me too. I considered myself agender for a while, until recently I heard about demigender. After some research, I realized I'm a demiguy. Partly agender and partly male. I'm not saying you're not agender, just giving my thoughts on this."
genderqueer,3dinq0,Qscwdvfg,2,Thu Jul 16 20:51:57 2015 UTC,"I have had similar problems to you... to a degree I'm cisgender male. To another degree I'm agender or genderfluid or whatever the word is... I like my body as it is... but I think I would like it just as much if it were female, if that makes sense... or at least sometimes I think that. Other times I think I'm overthinking things. :3 So really I'm in the same situation you're in. Although for me, it's more like, I'm a man, yeah, but I'm also a woman too and just never noticed it until recently. My body is male, but my soul is both male and female (rather than neither)... which sounds totally insane and I really don't know how to understand or process it or know for certain that what I'm experiencing is real or is it just a phase or what. So I'm in the same boat as you.  Basically, sometimes I feel male, other times - less often probably, but sometimes - I feel female instead. Rarely in between though, but I could probably appreciate in betweenness too... So whatever that means, that's what I am... don't worry though, you're not the only confused person. :)"
genderqueer,3dinq0,syzithryx,2,Fri Jul 17 00:50:07 2015 UTC,"Just to put in my two cents (im ftm, not genderqueer, hope I'm welcome here) I don't believe that gender is purely social construct. If it was, there would be no explanation for the dysphoria that I and many others have felt.   There is no social explanation for the insane feeling of living in the wrong body. Even in the absence of scientific research, I do believe there are some things about our gender identities that are innate and cannot be changed.  It does sound like you're experiencing some types of dysphoria, and you're not alone in questioning your labels. Explore your feelings and identity for now and try not to worry so much about picking a label."
genderqueer,3dinq0,samuelmouse,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:22:26 2015 UTC,"I could have written a fair bit of this. Unfortunately, being in a very similar boat, I don't have a lot of advice other than to emphasize that it's okay to take your time to explore and settle on a label (if you even decide you want one). If adopting the label makes you happy and less dysphoric though, does it really matter why you feel that way?"

genderqueer,3dinq0,googoocello,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:41:01 2015 UTC,"What you wrote really resonated with me.  A lot of it echoes things I wrote when I ""put on the questioning hat"" about five years ago.  I had a strong conviction that ""gender doesn't exist"" but at the same time found I had feelings about it that apparently contradicted that.  My feelings grew more troublesome the more I had to interact with ""the real world"" and be perceived as a woman, in spaces where I couldn't just hide behind the tomboy label anymore.  And I also experienced worsening body dysphoria at the same time, though I can't say if it was directly caused by having to interact with the world as a woman.  In the end, I found some labels that fit me: non-binary, transmasculine, genderqueer.  But that's not really what led me to peace with my gender.  Regardless of which words I use to describe it, defining a transition path of my own and executing it at my own pace was the solution.  If for you that means just changing the way you think about your gender identity, congratulations, you're done!"

I think people see me as a genderfuck because I get weird looks but always masculine honorifics or pronouns though I prefer they.. or even she to he.

genderqueer,3ddhbz,Talga_Vassternich,11,Wed Jul 15 13:13:07 2015 UTC,"It probably depends on the environment you're in, like in some places there's definitely pressure to sort of ""fit the mold"" in that dfab masculine way but I also know plenty of people who are quite traditionally feminine in appearance yet are actually nonbinary. But you hardly see any of those people in mainstream depictions of GQ folks, which is a big problem. It's always the dfab masculine person in a suit and maybe a dmab person wearing makeup but not much else. I know nonbinary people who look all sorts of ways but there's definitely pressure from all sides and it does generally go against being ""too feminine."""

genderqueer,3ddhbz,NotTheNineOClockNews,9,Thu Jul 16 08:43:14 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think it's just more of the larger social misogyny bleeding into the smaller groups and subcultures. I've gone into the tiniest splinters of human societies, from college clubs about gender to forums specifically for women of color, yet somehow there's still misogyny shitting on things.   It's like you get a smaller and tighter group where people find others more and more like themselves, but there's always some who wanna shit on those who are different. Then they hide behind the whole ""protecting us from the fringe so society accepts us"" bullshit.  I don't know. People are people.

genderqueer,3ddhbz,Beloit,4,Wed Jul 15 18:29:39 2015 UTC,"Well, I think a lot of it comes down to a larger proportion of the GQ community (for whatever reason) being AFAB. For AFAB people, they might feel an aversion to femininity because they're trying to move away from it, and masculinizing your appearance if you're AFAB is one of the more effective ways to look androgynous.   Not all of us are genderfuck. Many of us are just nonbinary people with gender dysphoria. I don't think we should be shaming people for their preferred gender presentation, regardless of whether it's politically convenient.   That said, I certainly hope our community is being inclusive of AMAB genderqueer folks and anyone else who wants to present in feminine or genderfuck ways. And if not, what can we do to improve our inclusivity?"
genderqueer,3ddhbz,BuffyCreepireSlayer,6,Thu Jul 16 05:13:03 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand where you're coming from here, OP.   For AFAB people, veering toward the masculine is a way of neutralizing the femininity of their secondary sex characteristics. For AMAB people, veering toward the feminine is a way of neutralizing their secondary sex characteristics. When you're genderqueer and try to pass, it's all about playing up some traits and playing down others, depending on what you naturally already have. Dapper men's clothing on an AFAB body does read as androgynous or neutral, which is what a lot of genderqueer people are going for. Same for dresses on AMABs. So I just don't really understand what you're talking about. Are you upset that so many genderqueer people are AFAB? I don't get it. And if I'm really honest, I'm actually really sick of the implied discourse of AMAB trans people/genderqueer people have it worse (""getting murdered""). AFAB people are getting murdered too.  I'm neutrois and I aim for a neutral appearance -- my ideal is that people can't tell what's in my pants just by looking at me. I do this in ways that queers the body that I was born with.   Can you please explain what you mean by your last sentence? I'm just really confounded by this.   In a time when MAAB gender variant folks are being murdered frequently for wearing dresses, makeup, or otherwise presenting in ways society deems feminine, why are we not trying harder to queer the limits of femininity rather than routinely distancing ourselves from it?"
genderqueer,3ddhbz,lespectador,6,Thu Jul 16 01:20:54 2015 UTC,"The thing is though that GQ doesn't always have to equal neutral/androgynous presentation and a lot of the press we get as a community pushes the same sort of looks as ""these are the real nonbinary people"". What does it even mean to ""pass"" as GQ anyways, when we live in such a binary-oriented world? Why should there be a certain look we have to fit to identify as our gender? When the ""stereotypical GQ look"" is truly who you are, there's nothing wrong with it. But I'm constantly seeing a lot of folks cis and trans alike who try to invalidate people's genders when they determine that they're ""not really GQ"" since they don't try to be super androgynous in that stereotypical way. I am dfab and I do like to wear suits and such and have a short haircut to look androgynous, and that's just who I am. But I have plenty of other dfab nonbinary friends who wear their hair long, and like to wear dresses and makeup, and they are ridiculed constantly when they come out and told they're just cis. I don't have experience on the dmab side of things of course but I am sure others can speak about their own experiences. Anyways, I think the problem arises when we try to create a GQ gender box that we hold every nonbinary person to as some weird standard. And it's especially people on the feminine side of things that have their gender crapped on, and have a hard time finding resources for their experiences. And you shouldn't feel pressured to abandon feminine things to be accepted as GQ no matter what your assigned sex is. That's what the OP is saying I think, not ""GQ people who aren't feminine by their own nature are terrible""."
genderqueer,3ddhbz,caretta_caretta,3,Thu Jul 16 04:20:34 2015 UTC,"Now I'm even more confused. I think we are in agreement mostly. And I think there was some misunderstanding on both our ends. But I can't quite sort it all out now.... In any case--  OPs original post was railing against the so-called normativity within GQ presentation, i.e.:  that people reject femininity in favor of ""dapper"" masculine-leaning whatever presentations and that this is a form of transmisogyny. There are two issues here: 1)that there's some sort of normative GQ presentation or look, and 2)that aversion to femininity is a form of (trans-)misogyny. I couldn't disagree more. This stance is the one claiming that there is some sort of ""standard"" nb presentation, not us. I was trying to explain in my previous post that this is not a form of gq normativity, but instead a feature of the practicalities of presentation for SOME people in the gq community, specifically neutral- or androgynously-gendered AFAB people who try to compensate for their bodies' feminine sex characteristics by tending toward the masculine in their presentations. It's CERTAINLY not fucking misogyny. It's not an aversion to femininity. That's just ridiculous.  Also, if I might for a moment speak up for NBs, I think it's fair to say that we're all pretty damn sick of being flattened and reduced to a tumblr stereotype. No, GQ isn't always neutral/androgynous, but it sometimes is and we get a lot of shit for existing. Most visions of GQ people are the tumblr version -- skinny white AFABs with asymmetrical haircuts died bright colors and a nose ring who dress ""dapper"", OR, the totally personalized snowflake gender with 75 different labels attached. (NOTE: I am not policing anyone's identity or presentation here, just pointing out the stereotype this thread refers to.) I think that there's something MASSIVELY problematic if/when we designate that form (or any form) of presentation as THE prescriptive way to be gq or nb. A lot of us don't fit that at all! But I also DO understand the people who do present that way. As I said before, it's a way for AFAB people to try to achieve some form of androgyny. It is NOT an attack on or aversion to femininity as OP claims, and it is NOT a form of misogyny or transmisogyny as others in this thread are claiming. That is what I'm upset about here. I'm upset about OPs claim (and now yours) that this type of presentation is trying to stage some sort of ""these are real nb people"" normativity. No one is trying to impose any normativity. We're just trying to deal with our fucking bodies, each in our own way. And even though I don't think I necessarily fall into this category, I'm just really rubbed the wrong way when one gq person tells another that the way they present is harmful to the rest of the community. I just CANNOT STAND this sort of inner policing.  I have to admit that I'm feeling very sensitive about this issue right now, since the clusterfuck in /r/asktransgender last week. That's a space where as a nb person I have gotten a lot of harassment including people telling me -- without knowing ANYTHING about me including whether I'm AMAB or AFAB by the way -- things ranging from: ""Just like you cant identify out of gender. ""Neutrois"". Everyone sees you as a butch woman, the vast majority. Im not even attacking, Im just surprised you can't see this"" to ""you're just some stupid tumblr butch chick with purple hair and a nose ring trying to feel special by claiming to be trans."" ((And that's within the trans community btw. Super fucked up.))  Comments like these and yours and OPs just reinforce this kind of reductive vision that some people in this community -- specifically the people (regardless of AMAB or AFAB) who are trying for total gender ambiguity such as neutrois like myself -- are doing transness/genderqueerness wrong, that we're not valid or not trans enough or not trans in the right ways. It also erases basically all other GQ presentations. I saw this whole thread last night and it really got under my skin...still sorting out exactly what to do with it and why it bothered me so much, and now I'm realizing that it's the issue of policing and regulation of gender that it implies. It's also the internal contradiction in the original post, i.e.: you can't claim to be against normative bullshit and then in the same breath be normative about how some people present.   What does it even mean to ""pass"" as GQ anyways, when we live in such a binary-oriented world? Why should there be a certain [stereotypical] look we have to fit to identify as our gender?    For binary trans this is a whole other issue that I won't address. For nb people, this is a super interesting question. There is a range of factors though. NB is already in itself a sort of umbrella designation, and reducing us to the image depicted above is just wrong. But if I might speak for a moment to my own personal case: passing for me is NOT about trying to achieve some sort of stereotypical image of genderqueerness (""the stereotypical GQ look"") AT ALL. Couldn't be further from what I want. I am neutrois and I feel that I do have a positive gender identity (i.e. not agender) and that this gender is 100% neutral, nonbinary. Passing, for me, would mean that people looking at me would absolutely not be able to tell what's in my pants unless I disclose to them. ((I've talked about this at length in other places in /r/asktransgender and /r/genderqueer, but just in sum, yeah, it's complicated...)) It's about reducing my crippling physical dysphoria and not about subscribing to some normative image of what GQness looks like.  I'm sorry people wish there were more femininity in gq identities, but not all of us are genderfuck or gender fluid or interested in playing with our genders in provocative or political ways. Some of us are just trying to not feel crippled by our dysphoria.   And it's especially people on the feminine side of things that have their gender crapped on, and have a hard time finding resources for their experiences.   I honestly can't handle statements like this. I'm really tired of the grass-is-always-greener mentality within the trans community and the gq community about who has it worse and who has it easier. None of us have it easy. Please don't get me wrong. I am nothing but sympathetic for the nuanced issues that some people in the trans and gq communities face. But we each face our own different hells. As I mentioned in other places in this sub and during the /r/asktransgender civil war, lots of transmasculine AFAB people face the same fear and bigotry that transfeminine AMAB people face because bigots don't care in which direction someone is transitioning. They see someone non-gender-conforming and think ""tr*nny""or ""he-she"" and that's that. I know non-passing transmasculine AFABs who have been asked if they cut off their dicks yet and who have been treated with the same awfulness that AMABs get because bigots just saw a gender freak and don't bother to differentiate between mtf and ftm and other forms of genderqueerness. I personally have gotten harassment IRL by people assuming that I was MTF, by people assuming that I was FTM, and by people assuming that I was ""some sort of hermaphrodite."" I've been assaulted, spat on, followed home. Once I had a knife held to my throat. (That's the joy I get for my nb passing, i.e. coming across as totally gender ambiguous. There IS no stealth for my gender. Is this better/easier than what MTFs face? How is this a form of privilege?) I wish we could all just STOP saying that one group or another has it better or easier or whatever.  I'm sorry this is coming across as so disjointed, and I hope it makes some sense.   TL;DR: If I can summarize my position here, it would be this: I would LOVE it if I could never see again (especially from members of the trans/gq/lgbtq communities) posts that say that XYZ form of transness or gqness are wrong or harmful to other trans or gq identities or that XYZ form of transness or gqness has it easier. No. No one gets to police anyone else's gender identity or presentation or declare which experiences have it better. I'm tired of the us vs them in these communities.  (edit: added tl;dr. sorry for the massive screed.)"
genderqueer,3ddhbz,lespectador,5,Thu Jul 16 15:19:16 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm sorry if I wasn't too clear about what I was trying to say. I really think we do agree on a lot of points. I absolutely didn't mean to imply that the androgynous look is lesser in any way. I am dfab and trying to achieve that same look myself. It is just who I am. I was mostly talking about people within the trans and greater queer community who take that ""stereotypical"" androgynous look as their standard for who is ""really"" GQ.   In my experience, a dfab nonbinary person whose transition is comparable to that of a binary trans man is more likely (not always, but more likely) to be accepted as ""really nonbinary"" than a dfab nonbinary person who keeps a ""feminine"" body and appearance. While there are people everywhere who will invalidate other's identities, in this case it does come down hard on people who are more feminine, and creates pressure for people to fit the ""stereotypical"" image in order to have their identity respected. This is obviously not unique to GQ people though. It happens to all trans people. And I totally agree that the ""You're harming the community by being yourself"" sentiment is incorrect.   I am absolutely not picking on any individual's own sense of self and they way they want to present. Like I said, I myself mostly fit that image of the dfab who wears suits and ties and has a short haircut and such. I have done a lot of soul searching and thought about my own presentation and I do what I do because it makes me happy. I have nothing against dresses and jewelry, they just aren't for me most of the time. But for people who are still trying to find themselves, and especially for nonbinary people who are facing hostility even within the trans community, the pressure can be there to abandon feminine traits and develop some internalized misogyny about it. But that is for each individual to tackle on their own. No trans person should be deciding who is ""trans enough"".   I'm not dmab so take this with a grain of salt, but I believe part of the issue there is that it is hard to achieve a middle ground without veering into an area where people start to just see you as a trans woman. In my experience, (some) feminine characteristics are generally seen as adding gender to a person whereas (some) masculine characteristics are seen as genderless. I can think of some masculine characteristics that would be seen as adding gender (a beard, genitalia) but there aren't a lot of feminine characteristics that people read as genderless. Breasts are the big one in this category I think. Even within GQ circles, people get really skeptical really fast about dfab people who don't have dysphoria about their breasts. Again, if you do have that dysphoria, you should do whatever you need to reduce it and it is completely valid. But if you don't, you shouldn't have a ""feminine"" characteristic of yours used as a weapon to attack your identity. Neither is more right or wrong than the other, but it is the feminine characteristic and not the masculine one that is seen as ""less legit.""   Because feminine characteristics are generally seen as adding gender, dmab GQ people who want to present femininely have few options without being misgendered as a woman. What people seem to be saying is that there are resources for trans women but not a lot at all for dmab GQ people, because once you hit a certain level of femininity people start thinking you're a woman. The dmab people I have seen in mainstream depictions of GQ people who are seen as androgynous typically still land more on the masculine side of the spectrum. I hardly see any of them with breasts, whereas I see so many ""androgynous"" dfab people in binders. I am sure that more dmab people can shed light on this further. But Whereas I see plenty of GQ-identified dfab people who are very very masculine with hardly any feminine traits, I rarely have seen their dmab counterparts who are very very feminine and drop all masculine traits. Every individual's choice on how to present their gender is valid. But we can't ignore that pressure to not be ""too feminine"" exists for us as nonbinary people. Even within the trans community itself.   I don't feel comfortable talking too much about what OP said about trans feminine folks as I am not one myself. But I hope that this can help clarify what I was trying to say with my post, and maybe we can discuss it further."
genderqueer,3ddhbz,caretta_caretta,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:44:06 2015 UTC,"There does seem to be a distinct lack of MAAB voices getting attention in our community, though - if you try and look for resources for FAAB nonbinary people and then look for those targeted at MAAB nonbinary people, it's much harder to find the latter. I didn't really realise it until I looked into it myself for a project I was working on. And if you look at media appearances, (in the UK at least, not sure about other places) it tends to be white, thin, masculine-presenting FAAB people who get the attention. Not to mention that MAAB people who present in a feminine way are at far more risk than FAAB people, who even when they present as masculine or androgynous are often just assumed to be 'tomboys', 'butch lesbians', etc., and fly under the radar of people who might otherwise be discriminatory or violent towards someone they read as trans/nonbinary."
genderqueer,3ddhbz,TheNightisYoung,2,Fri Jul 17 22:09:48 2015 UTC,I absolutely agree with you. I was just saying that this isn't the fault of FAAB people though and it doesn't do anyone any good to be hostile to them or police them either.

genderqueer,3ddhbz,shaedofblue,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:58:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but I don't think you understood any of what I was saying. My only point is that policing AFAB people for how they present doesn't make anything any better for AMABs or AFABs or anyone. Calling them transmisogynists just for how they are and how they present is nonsensical. Of course AMABs have it bad, but no one in the trans community has it easy and the ""I have it worse than you"" discourse doesn't help anyone."

genderqueer,3ddhbz,truetrans,3,Wed Jul 15 18:47:21 2015 UTC,GQ agender MAAB here. Trying to find androgynous clothes online for men is a chore. Choices are skewed massively in favor of women.
genderqueer,3ddhbz,alugura,7,Wed Jul 15 19:44:33 2015 UTC,"Men's clothing for AFAB bodies is just as hard. There are some things like ""boyfriend cut"" but what's the point when it still has those weird boob pouches on the shirt, doesn't look anything like neutral or androgynous. I think a lot of gq people don't look at androgynous clothing marketed toward their assigned gender because that doesn't really exist. instead they look at clothing marketed to both men and women, and try to pick and choose what fits and feels right aesthetically. Sizes and cuts are a huge issue for AFAB bodies too.  I want unisex clothing in cuts that don't highlight my secondary sex characteristics. I can't find that"
genderqueer,3ddhbz,lespectador,6,Thu Jul 16 01:31:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I was thinking. Aesthetic and proper form. Now where's my tailor when I need them?

I'm beginning to find some options, especially in the Asian market, but I shouldn't need to buy stuff from Korea to be a bit more androgynous!"
genderqueer,3ddhbz,redfarmer1980,3,Wed Jul 15 21:29:46 2015 UTC,"there's a general lack of suggestions on neutral/gender ambiguous/gender non-conforming presentation options for all of us. AFAB gq people get TONS of shit for all looking the same (the tumblr stereotype mentioned here already), and while that's bullshit, it come in part from the fact that if you're female-bodied, there's only so many things you can do without binary transition to get toward true ambiguous presentation (short hair, masculine clothing, etc)"
genderqueer,3ddhbz,lespectador,2,Thu Jul 16 01:34:39 2015 UTC,"There's a geographic variation on this. I'm AMAB and I turn up routinely at events (SF Bay Area) in a black top, pink bloomers, heels and make-up and get mostly encouragement from my friends and people around me. It's not a lucky accident, it was a studied decision to be near my queer family and it worked out. Yes, I hear the occasional slur but it's sotto voce which is in itself a kind of respect.   There is definitely an inclusive element to GQ that obtains some places and not others. Ex.: I'm near Montpellier, France, for vacation. The Montpellier Pride event was 11 July and it was devoted to lesbian and gay expression. I don't / did not see genderqueer represented at all."
genderqueer,3ddhbz,jet_silver,5,Wed Jul 15 18:32:58 2015 UTC,I think there are people who are all about pushing the limits of femininity - but then again their are people who aren't.  But we shouldn't force people to do so just because that is what is lacking at the current moment.
genderqueer,3ddhbz,ungendered,0,Wed Jul 15 13:03:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah...  GQ community: More resources about transmasculine ppl. Transgender community: More resources about transfeminine ppl.  This is kind of the reason why I consider it more like this:  GQ community = Transguy community. Transgender community = Transgirl community.  Then if someone asks me for resources I just look at that ^ and direct them to the ""appropriate"" community.  This is bad, but idk how to change it. We'd need a thousand ppl to make the resources better and more evenly distributed and stuff."

I got told off in this very sub for suggesting that it might be a factor in a particular poster's dysphoria about wearing dresses as an AFAB person.   Being that I reject ""manhood"" as a concept entirely, the fact that what I was seeing being presented as genderqueer - AFAB folks in menswear and calling it dapper - smelled like just aversion of any/all femininity to me. And it made me reluctant to pursue my own transition, being afab myself, because I felt like I would necessarily be associated with that."

AFAB folks in menswear and calling it dapper - smelled like just aversion of any/all femininity to me.   ...again, gender dysphoria."

You might learn more terms like demi-guy, dualgender, bigender, just genderqueer is cool too. You can even stick with dude and wear femme stuff.

genderqueer,3df3qn,BuffyCreepireSlayer,5,Wed Jul 15 20:43:49 2015 UTC,"Yup.   It's all about gender identity vs gender expression. Gender identity is how you see yourself in terms of gender. That's, basically, whether you feel male, female, or something else.  Gender expression is how you communicate gendered feelings to the outside world via dress/presentation/etc.  Whether you're genderqueer or not depends entirely on your gender identity, NOT your gender expression. While identity and expression often go together, as many people want to communicate their sense of gender to others, this is not at all a requirement. You can be a binary cis-male and wear dresses every day and not be genderqueer if you consider yourself to be a binary cis-male. Likewise, you can be genderqueer, or transfeminine, or binary female and still present entirely male. It's all about how you identify."

And I present as a stereotypical male because I'm in the process of losing a lot of weight.

genderqueer,3dcrdf,queerbotrob,5,Wed Jul 15 06:39:36 2015 UTC,"Two weeks isn't a long time, but it's long enough to tell you that there's something to it.   Maybe just tell your friends that you're questioning gender and you don't think you're simply cisgender. You could be fluid, or bigender, or consistently nonbinary. Or maybe you're cis enough of the time that changing your labels doesn't make sense for you. Give yourself plenty of time to observe your feelings. You don't have to settle on a label, and even if you do, you can change your mind later.   Welcome <3"
genderqueer,3dcrdf,aoeui-dhtns,6,Wed Jul 15 08:10:28 2015 UTC,"There are a couple possibilities. One, you could be genderfluid. Two, you could be a gender non-conforming cis woman.   The thing is, gender isn't determined by presentation or emotions. I believe gender dysphoria is what makes a person trans, and if you don't experience it, you are cis. However, if you're genderfluid like I mentioned earlier, it's likely that your gender shifted and now you're dysphoric about the female aspects of yourself. That's the most likely reason you're feeling this way, imo. Genderfluidity is super weird and confusing. I had never considered that I could be trans until awhile back when I literally just suddenly was like ""I have no gender. I am agender. I am not a man. This is a thing that's happening right now."" A few weeks later, I realized no, I was definitely androgyne, not agender. I totally completely wanted to be 100% physically androgynous. A few HOURS later? Nope, nvm, I'm a guy for sure.   It was so confusing at first. I would suddenly shift genders out of nowhere, like you described. Sometimes I had a static gender for months, sometimes days, sometimes weeks, sometimes minutes, etc. I thought maybe I was just... confused or something? Like, I thought maybe I was going through some weird experimental phase. But I've come to accept that's not the case. I'm genderfluid.  Sorry for rambling, but hopefully my experiences have given you some sort of insight and comfort; you're not alone in questioning your gender identity. It'll all work out in the end. Message me if you need any advice."
genderqueer,3dcrdf,janinso,2,Wed Jul 15 09:09:02 2015 UTC,Oh god I sympathise with that feeling of confusion. For me it's been more flipping between neutral/male but I really felt like I was going insane for a while because I was changing so fast.
genderqueer,3dcrdf,esmemori,2,Wed Jul 15 10:26:33 2015 UTC,"Haha, I know right? It's so weird, until you finally get used to it and accept it. Then when your gender shifts you're just kinda like ""This again? Alright."""
genderqueer,3dcrdf,janinso,2,Wed Jul 15 17:32:41 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience. Felt totally comfortable ID'ing as cis for years, though I dressed slightly more masculine or ""hard femme"". Then over the course of about a month it started to feel weird to be referred to as ""she""/as a woman at all. I tried using gender-neutral pronouns and felt comfortable with them. Over the next few months I gave myself much more leeway to wear more masculine clothing, cut my hair increasingly shorter, actually contemplated taking hormones, etc. But, I didn't fully let go of femme presentation, either - though even on days where I dress femme, I still feel like a ""they"". For me it's a depends-on-the-day situation. Sometimes I feel completely removed from the ""woman"" identity, and sometimes I'm comfortable with it and can't imagine letting go. I've come to recognize that I'm a nonbinary woman, and use both she and they pronouns. Maybe that will change down the line, but for now, this identity works for me and gives me a lot of space to play around according to how I feel that day.  Good luck on your own journey, give yourself time to figure out what feels right. You don't have to know right away, and you may never have a ""[this singular identity] is exactly who I am and want to be"" moment, which is totally OK!"

genderqueer,3dc35g,Sirkai,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:02:16 2015 UTC,I like Seem from the Jak & Daxter games on the PS2. They are the head of a group of monks in a city of refuges located in the middle of a desert.   At first they were designed as a male character but apparently halfway through production the developer decided to switch the character to female. That kind of made things confusing and fans became pretty divided whether the character was supposed to be male or female. Their design and voice all are very androgynous and could go either way. Nowadays a lot of people go with female but there is also a rather large part of the fandom that sees Seem as non-binary/genderqueer.

Probably because I ignore all the male-bodied ones thanks in large part to my personal preferences (and there are a LOT more male androgynous characters in fiction than female ones).   But yeah, Kino. Kino is cool. I particularly like that she starts off as obviously female-gendered but switches to an androgynous fashion once she leaves her home. Doesn't counteract all the other 'tomboys' in fiction who 'grow out' of their 'phase', but it's still nice to see. I'd love to see more characters like her around."

genderqueer,3d8b8z,SpaceMaster9000,11,Tue Jul 14 08:04:47 2015 UTC,"My take is that other than ""queer"" which has been so well reclaimed that its barely even used as an insult any more,  all other reclaimed words are pretty much only okay to use to identify yourself,  not others.   I call myself a trans dyke.  But I would never even dream of calling another woman a dyke unless she were a close friend and I knew she was cool with it."
genderqueer,3d8b8z,flyonthwall,6,Tue Jul 14 09:36:28 2015 UTC,"If you use the word only to refer to yourself, it's fine, but you shouldn't use it to refer to someone else. There's a big difference between calling yourself something, and calling someone else the same thing - they may find it insulting or offensive even if you didn't mean it in that sense."
genderqueer,3d8b8z,Day-of-Light,5,Tue Jul 14 11:07:07 2015 UTC,"Really close friends can usually talk any kind of shit about each other. It's a way of being close to others. Not everyone is like that, tho. You should always check what's okay and what's not with the person in question, anyway.  I agree that queer has been so well reclaimed that it's rather safe to use - tho I have met a person who objected to it. So I don't use it about them or when they can hear.  You can call yourself anything, but should always be careful when you use charged words on other people, especially if they are not there to express their opinion about it."
genderqueer,3d8b8z,Sirkai,3,Tue Jul 14 11:14:40 2015 UTC,"I can understand that, though I find that the T-slur hurts me whether it's been ""reclaimed"" or not and puts me in a bad place.  So I guess I'm just cautious with all such words. Queer being maybe the only exception."

genderqueer,3d86no,KaossTheFox,5,Tue Jul 14 07:04:08 2015 UTC,"Finding yourself is one of the hardest things you'll go through. Especially when you keep changing within yourself.  For the longest time I was trying to figure out if I was a tomboyish transwoman, bigendered, genderfluid or something else in the spectrum. Before i came out i felt genderfluid was right for me. Not long after, it became apparent to me that it didnt fit, but bigender seemed more right. But in the past two months where Amber has taken the driving seat and what i felt was my male self slowly disappearing I began to feel more transgender. But unless my male side disappears completely, im sticking with bigender."
genderqueer,3d86no,TLaughingGirl,3,Tue Jul 14 07:18:23 2015 UTC,"For me it's like my female side is slowly fading away. But when it feels like it's all gone and my worries are officially over, boom! Kaycee comes back, and with a vengeance. Oddly enough, anything I do to try and bring her into a physical form through something like wearing more feminine clothes (which was kind fun at the beginning, but now it's just meh.) Makes that side of me go away. It's like my brain is saying ""Yeah, no. This is waay too weird for me."" and then just shuts it down. Wow... this gender identity thing is more confusing than I thought it would be."
genderqueer,3d86no,TLaughingGirl,2,Tue Jul 14 07:45:49 2015 UTC,"This is similar to how i felt when i first started questioning. When i was dressed in girls clothes it felt fun and like a rush, but eventually the 'fun' disappeared. It was only when i no longer had the freedom to express myself that way that it wasnt that the fun had died, it was that I felt comfortable in those clothes.  I cant relate so much to the whole 'female side' fading away as much though, for me Amber has always been there, but my own issues meant I locked her up inside me. But ive felt her influence all the time. It was only when I turned 30 that I finally realised that Amber was an important part of me and I've embraced her fully, even if I cant express myself as Amber."

genderqueer,3d86no,cassolotl,2,Tue Jul 14 20:45:55 2015 UTC,"That actually kinda makes sense. It would explain why I can't wear a pink... anything for 5 minutes without going ""Ok take this thing off of me now!"" And it explains why I don't like the idea of being in a skirt or dress even when I'm female. Guess it's time to stop ""borrowing"" things from my mother and start saving up for my own style."
genderqueer,3d86no,TLaughingGirl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:42:25 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. :) I mentioned it because your description of your experiences reminded me a lot of the tomboys I've known - allergic to pink, uncomfortable in dresses. There are plenty of women who aren't into that. It's weird because trans women are kinda expected to try to be femme so we know for sure their women, which is icky - so finding your own way to be a woman, which is a very diverse thing regardless of whether you're cis or trans, is gonna be really satisfying. :)"
genderqueer,3d86no,cassolotl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:18:27 2015 UTC,There isnt anything that says the two are mutually exclusive either though. Whilst my interests would be described as masculine as well as some aspects of my personality. My sense of self and my clothing preferences would easily be described as femme.

genderqueer,3d6fn7,FortuneDays-,2,Tue Jul 14 00:11:36 2015 UTC,"I have a theory that because ""homo"" means same and ""hetero"" means different, if you're attracted to people of a different gender to yours (eg: you're genderqueer and you like dudes) then you're hetero.  However, whether or not that means ""straight"" to you is a whole other question."
genderqueer,3d6fn7,cassolotl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:47:45 2015 UTC,"Really stupid nit-picky point here, but ""hetero"" generally means one or the other of two things, it's really got the idea of a binary built in.

So ive chosen to use more describe myself as gynopansexual. For me this means im attracted to femininity regardless of their gender identity. In your case it sounds like the most accurate description would be androsexual. But in the end voiddreamer is right only you can give a name to what you feel."

Queer or bi didnt feel right, I feel like I can comfortably describe myself as genderfluid or demigendered because they just seem right. Also if someone is 'confused', I think whatever the connotations of that description means at the time can be an example of a genderfluid person, which fits for me and is one of the reasons I use it."

However, in situations where I'm passing as female and not out, I call myself gay. Like you said, andro- and gynosexual are not out in the common lexicon, and it's the most effective way to communicate ""I'm attracted to women."" without outing myself or getting into long arguments about weird terminology or what have you.

Like do we really need to define and label everything? Labels are handy for speaking about things and questioning, but none of them really capture the fluid, complex reality we live in.  I mean, I have my main type (androgynous, blond, long haired, thin pretty people (I know I'm vain as shit)), but that's just the looks. Personality is key. Sometimes I crush on people I know I'm not attracted to appearance-wise, just because they're awesome friends. Also I'm polyromantic but not really practising it for practical reasons - most people are mono after all, and I don't mind it at all. I'm not even in the dating market atm to give myself some peace and quiet to deal with medical transition. How the hell do you label that?! Voluntary temporary asexuality with a side of pining for pretty people and best friends? Why would anyone think that's a great thing to define and present to the public?  So usually I say I'm queer if someone needs to know, and if they insist I put on the pansexual label, but just because it's the broadest one I can sort of fit myself under. You could say I'm a picky pan? Hehe. How about let's just forget the labels for a moment.  You do you. Just say who you're into, or don't. It shouldn't be anyone's business if they're not looking to date you. There's tons of straight trans* folks and no-one should be denying them their orientation any less than their gender."
genderqueer,3d6fn7,Sirkai,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:48:12 2015 UTC,"Sexual orientation is separate and distinct from gender identity. You could have any combination of gender identity and sexual orientation.  If you are physically female and are attracted to men, I would consider you heterosexual.

genderqueer,3d4kxs,NyxBean,12,Mon Jul 13 13:57:35 2015 UTC,"Transboy here.   I recently had to reject someone because they're a lesbian. And they said I was gay too. When I pointed out that, no, I'm a straight(ish) guy, she said that she ""dated guys before"" and ""can make an exception"". They knew I was trans, there had been conversations.  Basically, people who see you from the get go as a gender you're not, and do nothing to change that paradigm.   Also, girls who have just broken up with a guy. I think it's cardinal in anything to not be the rebound, but... It just sucked. They wanted their old boyfriend, or a real (read:cis) guy to compensate. You'll hate yourself."
genderqueer,3d4kxs,fff8e7cosmic,8,Mon Jul 13 14:50:14 2015 UTC,"Several users have covered this subject very well. In general, good communication, respect, and understanding (or efforts to do so) are important to any healthy relationship, regardless of sexuality, gender, or sex. Of course, that goes both ways- being able to clearly articulate how you identify  (or don't) and communicating with a potential or current SO how you want to be addressed can help others to understand how you want to be treated (respect).  So while binary folk might have a hard time understanding nonbinary folk getting down when others misgender them, it's something that we find important out of respect. Or comments about our presentation that aren't complimentary or constructive (although, as in general, criticism should be held until asked for).  Some early warning signs that I have personally encountered:   ""You look like a dyke when you wear those shorts.""    In general, I am not easily offended, but this statement, as benign as I took it, raised some flags- the use of an ostensibly homophobic slur obviously, but the concern of how I dressed somehow affected my sexuality, as well as the sexual dynamic of a relationship. Finally, if I dated guy or someone masculine, I would not think it appropriate to say ""those skinny jeans make you look like a f*g."" I ended this relationship a short while later and respect (or lack thereof) was a huge reason.   ""If you're dating me, that makes you straight/gay now.""    Now, this was a lack of understanding. I have actually been told this multiple times, but how the other person reacted to what I said next is probably the bigger red flag. Sexuality isn't determined by a relationship; I wouldn't call someone who is currently nonactive sexually or not in a relationship asexual, and just because I'm now in relationship with a straight man doesn't invalidate or erase my history with women. I consider myself genderfluid and bisexual, so for someone to say I'm simply straight or gay seems silly. I might be feeling more masculine some days, so does that mean my (straight-ish, cis) boyfriend is in a gay relationship? Trying to oversimplify a relationship, sexuality, or gender identity to make it easier to fit your understanding or view can be disrespectful and unproductive."
genderqueer,3d4kxs,ProfSnugglesworth,7,Mon Jul 13 17:44:23 2015 UTC,"Assuming you came out to someone and they seemed receptive or at least not repulsed.  Continued microaggressions such as misgendering even after being politely corrected.  joking also counts especially to others about gender.  Them wanting to avoid talking to others about your gender and preferences if the situation permits. not asking people to be your champion but to be an ally  Pressure for sex or sex based role play, which definitely applies to anyone.  Someone downplaying your disclosures about dysphoria creating situations i.e. gendered bathrooms, medical forms, gendered spaces. yes I might think too much, but that doesn't mean the struggle isn't real.

Anyone who tries to guilt trip you into acting as your assigned sex or constantly treats your gender as some kind of insult against them is someone you don't want to be with. Although ANYONE who guilt trips you for something serious or makes you feel like you can't be yourself, romantic relationship or otherwise, is something I can't personally condone.  I think a huge red flag for me is when a person starts making it a point to describe or refer to you in very invalidating ways. For me, this would be like constantly making fun of gender identities like mine or saying ""well, I'm not going to use 'they' and you're going to have to deal with it because you have two X chromosomes."" I would also consider non gender-related issues like your beliefs, orientation or personal comfort (like being uncomfortable with sex or being straight/gay/bi/pan/asexual/etc.) being a joke to them or being questioned or denied constantly a red flag.  Friends, romantic relationships and family should be supportive of you. I can understand them being concerned or giving their opinions, but outright attacking something like your gender, orientation, beliefs and comfort and not respecting that or denying that it can even exist is just not a good sign in a  relationship.

If you feel faint at all, take off excess clothing and cool down immediately. Also, taking off your jacket periodically will help you stay cool longer. Good luck!"

I can't live without a binder now, but it makes daily living so much hotter, so much unnecessary sweating and discomfort. I'm guessing you can't wear a tee shirt over a sports bra to swim?

Even if they're accepting, just coming out with a random statement that doesn't explain what you mean by it or your thought process is going to be jarring and strange to someone who doesn't know these feelings. Maybe bring up Caitlyn Jenner in conversation. ..like say you saw something on FB about her to get it started and you can gauge their opinions from there. You can also use it as a platform to explain gender variations to them, before telling any of them that you are gq.

[either formal groups or informal friendships, etc.] that way if you are rejected or abandoned the pain won't be as devastating. [with that said, i totally empathize regarding your mother: that is and will be a tough one to face]  like i said if i'm totally wrong regarding the above, please disregard it, knowing that i wish you the best as what you are trying to navigate [balancing your need for both openness and acceptance with a need for privacy in a position of professional leadership] is at best a tricky one.  all the best and <3"

Or is that not how it works? Cause I don't even know my own feelings, let alone how gender works lol.   Your gender identity can certainly fluctuate like that. However, a lot of people will give you a hard time about changing pronouns, etc repeatedly. Changing pronouns once can be a stumbling block for a lot of folks, and doing so repeatedly is just that much more likely to be rejected, unfortunately.  Someone in my friend group identified as genderfluid for a while (she considers herself binary female now), and we would all switch pronouns based on her presentation that day. On days where she would dress/present in a masculine way, we called her ""he,"" and on days where she would dress/present in a feminine way, we would call her ""she."" So it is possible to work that sort of thing out, if you have a very accepting friend group, but it can be tricky.   Being nonbinary (or trans in general, really) unfortunately requires us to balance what makes us comfortable vs what other people will accept :/   Can I ask if you've found out what you ""are""? It's okay if that's too personal, though.    It's a bit of a complicated answer. I'll say ""sort of."" I am very comfortable as neutrois now, and I'm not confused and conflicted and miserable in the way I used to be. But I leave room for further self-discovery, as there are some days where I wonder if I won't discover some other identity fits me better in the future.   What I'm gonna do, for now, is use my new binder and trim up my hair to look like an actual cut (it's still in the process of growing out) and see how I feel   That sounds like an excellent plan to me.

I tried to convince myself that I'm crazy for evening considering the possibility that I might be outside the binary. But, I've had doubts here and there, things not quite feeling right, sometimes even wondering if I was just a weird boy. Then I just realized that I don't feel like a boy or a girl. Those categories just don't fit me.   Right now, I appear like a girl, which isn't ideal, but a far cry better than looking like a boy. But ideally, I would look androgynous. I typically don't care for strongly gendered clothing, though occasionally I'll get the impulse to put on a suit, or a cute skirt. I would be addressed by neutral pronouns, instead of being shoved into one of the two gender categories acceptable in modern American society. And yes, I do feel envy for those butch women or femme guys that can rock the fuck out of androgyny.

genderqueer,3cvk58,EryduMaenhir,2,Sat Jul 11 22:35:03 2015 UTC,"I realised a while ago the only way I can get exactly what I want was to be able to alter my body repeatedly and easily based on state at the time. I idealise a certain AMAB body (the very androgynous/femme-leaning version seen in people like Andreja Pejić during her time identifying as genderqueer) but it's something I rarely see outside of manga and anime. I'd want to switch between male or female primary sexual characters with either no sexual secondary characteristics or feminine ones.  That's four distinct ideals, one of which I can achieve very well since my body is very feminine but most of the time I want suppressed secondary characteristics. That one I cannot achieve to a passing degree, I still don't even come up on people's gaydar often and still get guys catcalling and making passes. I often wear a hoodie to pass, especially when I'm with my fiancée as most assume I'm a straight guy and it feels good, but I realise I'm passing by hiding my face and as soon as someone sees it or hears my voice that comes crashing down.  The other two ideals involve an AMAB body. I can never achieve those in any way without some great developments in either virtual reality or biotechnology. I'm resigned to the fact that without those, I'll never experience the same fluidity in my body as I do with my gender.  I'm really torn about my gender identity. Sometimes I really wish I could just be cisgender and feel that way all the time. On the plus side, my gender identity is deeply linked to my sexuality and libido and has opened up a lot of sexual experiences that I enjoy immensely and am enriched by. Given how important sex is to me, I think the benefits outweigh the costs.  But I still envy gender binary folk because because they don't have this same love/hate with their bodies, especially cisgender people. This envy is felt across the spectrum of LGBT people, there are gay people who'd prefer to be straight, transgender who'd prefer to be cisgender because of all the extra heartaches and problems created by being LGBT. I'm pleased with my sexuality but I would never condemn a gay person who wanted to be straight because I understand how distressing it can be. I don't think there's anything wrong with feeling envy, I just think letting that turn to bitterness or resentment is where the problem begins."

Neither??? Shit like that.   super valid, I'm super worried that I'll eventually be gender dysphoric over looking TOO masculine (I'm AFAB too).

It's just plain rude. You do not question customers about the names they give you; they're only for identification anyway. It's none of his damn business. As a former restaurant manager, I can say that that's not at all acceptable, ever.  As for your therapist, the range and depth of their training varies a great deal. I suggest finding some appropriate books for him. (I don't have any suggestions off the top of my head, but hopefully there are some in this thread or sub, or elsewhere.) Failing that, you may have to find a more open-minded therapist; there's no point in going to one who either can't respect you or can't understand you.  I'm sorry about it all, though."

If bigender/genderqueer sounds more correct, then that's okay too.  Trans people who have finished transitioning and have been out for years sometimes still have problems with misgendering or referring to themselves by their old name in their inner dialogue. It takes some time to overcome. It's normal to feel like you're ""faking it"" or you're not a ""real"" girl yet when you're first starting. It doesn't make your identity any less valid; it's something you overcome in time too.   Talking all of this out with a gender therapist would probably be a good next step. Hang in there!"
genderqueer,3cv9ix,komsomolet,2,Sat Jul 11 01:52:34 2015 UTC,"You should have the freedom to change your body as you wish, full stop. You should act how you enjoy acting, be sincere, and authentic. Labels can come after those things. They give a name for what you are, they shouldn't be used to tell you what you should be.   Women (girls, I guess in your case) can have any personality under the Sun. That yours has been shaped by the assumption that you're male does not mean that your resulting personality isn't one that can belong to a woman. Keep in mind, people, regardless of gender, internalise how both men and women should act. So if you end up identifying as a woman, thinking that some of those things apply to you will necessarily shape your personality in a way that they wouldn't if you identifying as a man.   Complicated feelings do not mean you must be genderqueer. For some GQ people their feelings are very simple, and for some more binary trans people (hi) their feelings are more complex. That's all fine. Don't feel like you need to adopt a new identity because of where you think other people will want you to fit. You will fit where you fit best for yourself, and that's good."
genderqueer,3cv9ix,Glass_Underfoot,2,Sat Jul 11 03:51:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly your obsessive thoughts sound exactly like when my dysphoria causes anxiety. Like when I'm doing stereotypically 'girl' things my inner voice tries to convince me that I must be a girl and that just makes me more upset with myself. In my case I eventually found that viewing myself as a camp guy made me less stressed and vastly reduced my anxiety. Now I gently remind myself of that whenever I start getting stressed and I'm a much calmer person. Those stress based thoughts don't define my gender, they just speak of my fear.  Forgive yourself for having these thoughts and feelings, and please don't force yourself in to seeing certain personalities as female or male. People come in all types and varieties!

Starting with a traditional male suit:   Replace the jacket with a visually similar women's one.  The change is subtle. Replace the tie with a neck ribbon.  Just take a nice silk ribbon and tie it like your show laces where your tie would go. Replace the trousers with a long, solid color, pleated skirt, e.g. http://www.landsend.com/products/womens-solid-long-pleated-skirt/id_237409. Express your personal style with some calf length or higher socks. Put something in your hair.  Again, use your personal style. Do light make-up.  It shouldn't be obvious you're wearing anyway, but it should smooth out your features. Earings.  I tend to do something modest and non-dangley    Just to be clear, male gendered things that stick around:   Dress shirt. Shoes. I carry a pocket watch. Avoid most other kinds of jewelry.   I like this style because it's very distinct from both traditional male and female outfits, but still fits the general themes.  Feel free to improvise on it :) Trousers and heels maybe ?"
genderqueer,3cq7ne,Zearen_Wover,2,Fri Jul 10 04:15:39 2015 UTC,"Definitely liking the idea of a neck ribbon replacing a tie. I'd almost recommend leaving it above the collar, stewardess-style. A women's cut jacket could go a long way, and maybe a brighter-colored belt (though I don't know how professional that is). I would personally recommend steering clear of skirts as even for cis women skirts are often scrutinized in the workplace. Perhaps khakis and a women's blazer?"

When I was in high school, I ""came out"" to my parents as generqueer and my mother laughed at me. Hearing her laugh at me was more devastating than hearing anything else since. I bought a chest-binder on my own online, and used it for a year or two until it went ""missing"" - I have a bad habit of misplacing things, so I believed it was just in the depths of my closet or something. It wasn't until I was in college did I realize that my mother had taken it from my room and thrown it away... And it wasn't until I finished college did she admit to it.

For me personally, the more attention I get from employees, the worse it is.   Something that helps me is going with a cis person if the gender certain clothes were made for. My partner used to help with this a lot. Not only did I get to pretend I was helping him shop, but he also suggested things that would work well and was alway really encouraging of me trying things on. When something didn't work, he made it about the clothes, not about my female-ish body.  This might not help OP, since most teens don't want mom's help shopping, regardless of their gender identity.

First, about my dad.  He was a Korean and Vietnam war vet. Some well-managed PTSD, but outside of that, a decent guy.  He and my mom ran a hunting guide thing in the Montana wilds after he retired from the Military.  He passed away 12 years ago to medical conditions relating to Agent Orange exposure.  My mother has one sister, three brothers, and grew up on a cattle ranch.  She doesn't get lost, even in the wilds without a map or compass.  She is a better shot with a rifle than my dad was, even with his training.  She's shot and killed deer at more than twice the distance my dad could.  She can't understand why the other women at church don't know how to change a flat tire, do routine vehicle maintenance, or why they don't even want to learn.  She walks fast, dominates a space like a man does, and has a limited range of feminine mannerisms, but is unquestionably a woman.    Society expects men to be this way, women to be that way, and never the twain should cross.  The reality is not so cut and dry.  Just because my mom can drop an animal at a mile, hike to it and gut it herself does not make her any less of a woman.  Sure it's not a stereotypical woman, but it's what she can do.  I realized that I wasn't ""cis"" a couple years back when I started getting treatment for depression and anxiety.  That ""I feel like I'm just existing without knowing who I am"" feeling.  Knowing a part of me is female, without the need to be girly, helped pull me out of the depths of depression.   What /u/alexbian said doesn't have to mean your gender is at question.  It may well be that you have a developing case of depression.  That empty, emotionless, identity-less feeling is what my depression felt like.  It was only after I started a course of medication and therapy that the source of my depression became apparent, that I was transgender.  Maybe it's the same for you, maybe it's not.

I still haven't figured out what that means, and I have a lot to learn, but it's definitely a confusing time for me.  I've been diagnosed with ADHD, bipolar, and OCD, all of which I'm being treated for, so next week when I see my therapist I think I need to talk this out with her and figure out where to go from here.

Many of them in the early/questioning phase can't imagine being completely femininely attired can't imagine a day that they'll willingly put a dress on and go outside, but it's generally internalised transphobia that's preventing them from allowing themselves that option.

Not to shove you in the trans box, but I'd do a good bit of reading if I were you.

The transgender community is broad and includes binary people and also nonbinary, genderqueer, agender, and genderfluid folks. While I've also felt at times that the trans community can feel more welcoming to binary folks, there are lots of people in the community who identify outside the binary. At trans events, like at the Philly Trans Health Conference, for example, there are workshops on genderqueer identities and TONS of people came. You are not alone, we are not alone. :-)  Also, as a side note, there are some binary trans people who can't go on hormones for medical reasons or don't go on hormones because they decide hormones aren't the right path for them. And there are nonbinary folks, like myself, who go on hormones because the hormones help me with dysphoria, even though I don't identify as binary. I think you'll find, within the trans community, there is quite a wide range of people who identify in all sorts of different ways. And however you identify, however you present yourself, whatever form your body is in - you are welcome."

But when it comes to the law, we stand together because the same laws impact a lot of us at once.   We fight to be recognized as real inside the community and out. The community fights for us.

Biological sex is socially constructed in the same way that calling my arm an ""arm"" is socially constructed. In that sense, pretty much everything we use to refer to and categorize ourselves and our surroundings is socially constructed. It doesn't mean it's not a valid way to categorize something and it doesn't mean that category is not real.  Biological sex is how we refer to a grouping of physical characteristics that generally go together and are generally split evenly among the population. Ovaries, vaginas, and an estrogen-dominant hormonal profile vs penis, testicles, and a testosterone-dominant hormonal profile. These are valid categories, physiologically speaking, that the vast majority of the population fits into. I certainly think it would behoove us as a society to acknowledge that it's more of a gradient than a binary switch, but I don't think it makes any sense or is at all helpful to act as though these groupings of characteristics don't exist in a real way."

genderqueer,3cgboj,BuffyCreepireSlayer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:52:29 2015 UTC,Genetics is what genes and chromosones you have. Biological sex is really just another way of saying your sex as defined by your phyiscal characteristics.   If you're AMAB but have a female hormone profile and female secondary sex characteristics then are you not more biologically female than male? If you've had SRS then it's even more so. Despite not having the reproductive organs.   At least that's the way I see it. But I wouldn't say biological sex = genetics. Genetics determines at first your biological sex but biological sex isn't static. Whereas genes for the most part are. There's some overlap in the terms sure but not really in this discussion.

Sex is a status assigned at birth based in anatomical characteristics, which are grouped into two binaries, regardless of and to the detriment of inter-sexed people who exist as an exception.

I would think that most surgeons who have done the procedure frequently would be perfectly fine with you being genderqueer.  It sounds like you're in the beginning stages of research. Do you know what surgery you want to get (double incision? keyhole?)? Start by doing preliminary research to figure out what you want.

genderqueer,3cabha,crosscurious227,14,Mon Jul 6 09:54:13 2015 UTC,"Hi there. I'm nonbinary transmasculine and I've found it useful to think about transition steps as if they were body mods, both in connection with and separately from their gendered connotations. Then you can consider each one independently: 'do I want my body to look/feel like this result?' This might be useful to talk over with a support group, if one is available to you. Seeing a therapist specializing in or offering transition care is sometimes required and can even be useful if there's a good one in your area (this varies a lot.) Also reading up on lists and descriptions of the available options is helpful.    FWIW, in your case, hormone treatment would give you feminine secondary sex characteristics, gradually. Most transfeminine folks on HRT have fairly concealable breasts, and because it takes a while for them to develop, it would be fairly easy to stop before any point at which it became difficult to pass for male.   Based on what you've said, you also might be interested in facial hair removal or facial surgery. Facial hair or the lack thereof makes a difference in people's perceptions of gender."

Or is there a different hormone treatment for the results I'm looking for?   Most transfeminine folks on HRT have fairly concealable breasts, and because it takes a while for them to develop, it would be fairly easy to stop before any point at which it became difficult to pass for male.   This is the part I have many questions about.   So, the feminine sex characteristics would become apparent before the breasts start growing, correct?. If I stopped taking the medicine in order to prevent breast growth, would the secondary sex traits go away? Would I need to go on/off of the drugs repeatedly in order to maintain this state? If I started taking them again, would the breast growth continue right where it left off, or would it need the full length of time to reach that point again? I'm wondering how possible it is to maintain this perpetual state of pre-breast growth but yet post-secondary sex trait development and what steps that would involve.   Where does mastectomy/top surgery (like FtM's get) fit into the picture? Will it be necessary? If so, that would be something important to know before starting the process.  What do you mean by ""fairly concealable?"" Ideally I want no breasts at all no matter how concealable they are. I could probably live with ""totally concealable"" if there was no other option for transition.    Based on what you've said, you also might be interested in facial hair removal or facial surgery. Facial hair or the lack thereof makes a difference in people's perceptions of gender.   I've already wanted lazer hair removal for a long time. I don't know about facial surgery though. This is my face, it identifies me. I don't know that I'd want to change it just yet.   What about other feminizing surgeries? Do they exist? (Not counting SRS obviously.)"
genderqueer,3cabha,Propyl_People_Ether,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:48:48 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I think you're a little bit confused about how breasts work? They are a secondary sex characteristic... There's development of the breast tissue itself, which isn't really reversible (although, like I said, most trans women I know are below a C cup unless they have augmentation surgery) and there's migration of fat, which is gradual and reversible (AFAB people often go up or down a cup size during menstruation or weight gain/loss.)   But you don't get to a C cup overnight. So even though development begins pretty much immediately, you would have several months in which to look down at your chest and reflect on how you look and feel about it before getting out of the ""male normal"" range. I know a detransitioned transfeminine person who was on estrogen/spiro for some months and the amount of boob they have is in the range of what you'd see on a slightly chubby guy, if that makes sense.   Body fat redistribution and body hair changes (other than scalp hair loss and facial hair gain from testosterone) are mostly pretty transitory, and that includes hips and face, so there unfortunately isn't really a ""go on hormones then stop later"" option for you to have permanent results on that level. I mainly meant that if you feel happy with the idea of some effects and uncertain about others, it's possible to re-evaluate in progress; that if you ultimately didn't feel happy with the effects of hormones, almost anything that happened in a few months of taking estrogen would be reversible or not really worthy of comment to most people.   And I'm saying that because a lot of people wind up having different feelings about hormone effects than they do when they start. My trans woman friend who was most uncertain about breasts before going on estrogen is thrilled with her developments. Before I went on testosterone I was scared of my voice changing but really wanted lots of body hair; now I really enjoy having a lower voice and find my body hair a nuisance (I actually shave my back now, heh.)   So... Yeah. This sounds like it is going to be complicated for you, more than it already is for most people. I really recommend reading everything you can about the options available, going to support groups and finding a skilled therapist, because of this complexity. Bodies, eh? Can't live without 'em...   I'm going to post a FAQ  link in a moment (posting from phone and can't really scroll.)"

I'm AFAB, and female always felt wrong. I tried thinking of myself as male and it gave me dysphoria, so for the longest time I insisted that meant I just wasn't trans. For years, I kept feeling completely wrong in my body and my social role, I shied away from referring to myself as female, I spent hours reading all the details of FtM gender transition, and I even spent some time miserably wishing I were FtM so I wouldn't have to be a woman anymore. But if I tried being male, it felt very wrong. So I figured I was a weird cis person.   One night I had a dream where I was physically halfway between genders, and when I woke up I almost started crying because I was so devastated that it wasn't true. And then I realized I couldn't ignore it anymore, and that I had to seriously consider the possibility that I might be nonbinary.  Questioning is an arduous and painful process (at least for me), but I have never felt so free or comfortable with myself as I feel just letting myself be neutrois. It just feels... in-sync in a way I've never felt before in my life.  I'm glad you've found something that works for you as well."

I've never had a dream quite like that, but I do remember that in almost every dream I've had, I didn't seem to have a gender, but it wasn't really until recently that I've considered that a little detail like that might actually be important. But, coming to the realization of being non-binary was difficult in itself, and I thought I was crazy for even considering it as a possibility. But nope, I'm not, at least not for that. But I can definitely related to it feeling ""in-sync""; the doubts and ""what-ifs?"" have all but disappeared."

Have room for bits if I want to wear bits, which I rarely do.   My favorites are the sporty Jockey athletic y ones. Nice texture (uh I have texture issues and they were packaged so I could feel them, which was a big part of my decision making process) but since they're premium type, two to a box. These fit tighter/closer/snugger without being a wetsuit but have room to pack if I wanna. In my size (about a 10-14 depending on brand and day) they only came in black and blue, so I have two of each color. I like the blue ones better because I have problems with blue.   I also have done Hanes boxer briefs that came in like a four or five pack. They are less premium and are thus less smooth/soft, but came in stripy patterns. They are looser because the  Jockey ones are like 4 way stretch or some shit. They are sized right, but very long - I can really only wear them with ""guy"" cut cargo shorts or longer because of ride up of pants. I wear these less often. Just like the nicer fabric of the Jockeys."

So I went on with my life.  I made the decision to leave my SO a couple of months to be completely gender obsessed with her own shit. I thought this was important because she was definitely in her 'questioning phase' when she came out to me and I wanted her to have that mental space, after a few months I came out to her and she took it very well (obviously not guaranteed).  The one definite piece of advice I'd give you is not to try and ease into it by 'identifying' with your partner's trans feelings or experiences, this generally comes off as a cis person trying normalise, diminish or dismiss trans experience. Instead, be very clear that you're 'coming out' before you start talking about your trans/GQ feelings."

Yea I understand that.   feel as if I can't communicate how I really feel to others, and I wish there was a label to do that.   If you go through the list witch one resonates with you?  Genderqueer is perfectly okay if you don't feel male or female but can't specify it anymore.   I feel like I keep switching between labels too- and I know it's okay to change labels- but it just makes me wonder if there actually is a label out there that describes me.   Well only you can tell.   I'm just extremely determined, I guess.   Yea for the longest time I could best explain what I am by telling people what I'm not. Maybe that works for you as well?"
genderqueer,3c2d71,BuffyCreepireSlayer,3,Sat Jul 4 03:56:46 2015 UTC,"In other words, I don't feel quite female, but I don't see myself as male either. When I first said that out loud to myself, agender immediately popped into my mind. But I'm not really sure if that's what agender really is, because doesn't agender=genderless?   This is very similar to a lot of the thoughts I've had.  I'm not male, and I'm not female. I'm neither and both at the same time. For me, I've found neutrois (gender-neutral) to be the most accurate way to describe and categorize this. I feel very clear that I have a gender, and a strong sense of it too, so I am not agender. I'm gender-neutral.  You might also want to look into bigender and androgyne identities. Neutrois Nonsense has a lot of good nonbinary resources and a great post specifically for those questioning their gender."
genderqueer,3c2d71,BuffyCreepireSlayer,3,Sat Jul 4 08:33:38 2015 UTC,"I've thought about neutrois, but I've heard that neutrois means having male and female characteristics that cancel out to become gender-neutral. In my eyes, I see neutrois as a form of agenderedness, (Is that even a word? I'm sorry if I've got things wrong, I'm still learning here!) simply because you feel neither male or female. Even though agender is a lack of gender, can't it be a gender identity itself? I'm not sure if that makes any sense. I do have a sense of gender, but it's just not male or female. So the difference in neutrois and agender is the sense of gender that you have within yourself? Hm."
genderqueer,3c2d71,thusspakeconnor,2,Sat Jul 4 16:20:51 2015 UTC,"The meaning of the words aren't necessarily completely cemented, frankly, as this is such a new area of gender theory. I would say that    neutrois means having male and female characteristics that cancel out to become gender-neutral.   Holds true for me personally, but different people do sometimes use the words differently. I don't view neutrois as a type of agender so much as a somewhat related concept, although some people use them almost synonymously.    simply because you feel neither male or female.   Oh there are many identities that fall under the neither male nor female umbrella :) Agender is just one corner of that, really.   Even though agender is a lack of gender, can't it be a gender identity itself?   It certainly can. I know many people use it that way.   It's also okay to try things on to see how they fit. If agender calls to you... I recommend using that for a bit and seeing if it feels right. Neutrois felt very right before I fully understood why. I just felt... free and in-sync with myself for the first time, and no matter what else I tried or questioned I just kept circling back to it.   My recommendation is to trust your instincts, and see where they lead you :)"
genderqueer,3c2d71,thusspakeconnor,3,Sun Jul 5 04:05:20 2015 UTC,"The problem is, I don't really feel female. I'm not a feminine person. Never liked or cared for feminine clothing- I always felt out of place and seriously uncomfortable. I feel most comfortable in more...I guess...T-shirts and jeans. I do like wearing men's clothes. Growing up, I always wondered why it was frowned upon for females to wear men's clothes or vice versa, but I just want to wear whatever the hell I want or do what I want really. With that said, I do feel much more masculine than feminine. I find myself often taking on gendered characteristics of stereotypical males, but, the thing is- I don't see myself as male, and I don't want to be a guy. [...] I do think that I have both masculine and feminine traits, (more masculine than feminine to be honest), and because of that I considered myself somewhere along the lines of androgyne for a while. In other words, I don't feel quite female, but I don't see myself as male either. [...] I see myself as a person, a human being.   There are women for whom these things are true. I'm not saying you definitely aren't nonbinary, just that none of those things are incompatible with being a woman (and women past and present share such experiences); so, in my humble opinion based on this post, that your gender is woman is one of the possibilities you should keep in mind.   When I first said that out loud to myself, agender immediately popped into my mind. But I'm not really sure if that's what agender really is, because doesn't agender=genderless? Even though I feel like I have some sort of gender   That's something to consider. As far as what agender is...I see you've already posted to the sub. When trying to see how your experience matches up to theirs, you may want to mention that you ""feel like [you] have some sort of gender"". Also, I would recommend reading other posts people have made in that sub, if you aren't already.  Good luck!"

By the way, something I seem to have forgotten to put in my first comment- while you're looking into agender, it might be worthwhile to interrogate that sense of having a gender (why you ""feel like [you] have some sort of gender"", what that means, etc.)"
genderqueer,3c2d71,21stPilot,2,Sun Jul 5 22:05:40 2015 UTC,"I feel similar. I mean, I like calling myself a boy sometimes but anything other than she pronouns would just be kind of weird for me. Dysphoria isn't necessarily a requirement for being nonbinary or trans. Just do what makes sense to you. I think it's fine if you keep on using nonbinary to describe yourself, or you could be androgyne, or simply gender-nonconforming :-)"

I just don't get it. What's the point? I'm male-- but all that describes is my junk. It has no effect on my interests.   Why are liking sports, wearing dresses, working out, and going to the mall gendered activities? I mean, most of those things don't interest me, but still.  For what it's worth, I'm going with agender. Maybe neutrosis. I don't quite know. All I know is being considered a gender makes me feel uncomfortable. I'm a person, dammit! I carry a few labels, and all of them are more important than one that's assigned to me because I was born with a dick."

I really like your sprain analogy. If there's other things on your mind, the pain fades into the background. But then you step wrong, or someone asks how the ankle's feeling... welp, there it is again. I'm slowly coming to terms with the fact that the ""ache"" (depression, self-hated, addiction, apathy... you know, normal baseline stuff) is at least partially rooted in dysphoria. It's not explicit, earth-shattering dysphoria, but it's still there and it's still harmful."

For the not-well-anchored hairs it was fine.  For the deeper hairs with more root to them, some of those have been bleeders.  Yank too hard/fast and you can pull up more than just the hair, as well as cause inflammation, swelling and possibly bruising or bleeding.  I think there's a low incidence for damage, etc. A lot will depend on your skin and hair type.  Personally, I stick with a good DE razor shave and color corrective makeup.

I'm not sure how the surname works) who is AMAB. Still white, but still.  I don't like how articles like this just passively point out a problem ( and make people who happen to belong to the demographic feel targeted (like should I gain weight or something for you as I can't help my other attributes?)) but don't do anything to fix it. Or well, it would be fine, but I haven't seen a single one and the title in this one seemed to be about the diversity and not ""look at all these white pretty people ugh eww amirite?""

When I go through androgynous fashion blogs for inspiration, I rarely see anyone of my body type. It's like discussions of body diversity in fashion: it's dangerous to only use skinny white models, because you only represent that demographic, and give off the impression that your catalogue is only for skinny white people. It's dangerous to only use skinny white people to represent androgyny, because not only skinny white people are androgynous, and you give off the impression that androgyny is only for skinny white people. You shouldn't be ashamed for the characteristics that you have, but you should acknowledge when your features accumulate to be considered the ""norm"" for an entire group of people.   As a size-14, white, AFAB person (I'm questioning but I'm comfortable with an androgynous identity at the moment), I don't want anyone to feel ashamed if they look like Ruby Rose.

Since I started to embrace my Amber side that feeling has flipped I to feeling like Amber with a male side. Ive been out three month so far and have felt mostly like Amber for two of those months. I know I'm bigendered cause I feel two sides within me , but because I havent switched back so far I'm not sure if Im a bigendered transwoman (amber as a default state), or a bigendered androgyne (both sides are equal, and amber is just making up for all the time I held her in)  At the moment it feels like the former, but I dont want to rush into a transition if im gonna get dysphoric when my male side is more dominant.   I can asure you though, the feeling of being called by the name you are identifying as even if you cant present that way feels incredible.

(I seriously feel bad for people who want/feel the need to to fit into the traditional dude gender role. It leaves them with shorts as their only option for hot summerdays. Shorts are still too warm....) But anyway, I also had some issues with starting to wear skirts and dresses on days when I don't feel like a girl/don't want to be automatically misgendered as a lady. But since I didn't have any other options, besides serious swamp ass, I had to go with skirts, and now I've kind of learnt to not feel femme in dresses. I can still se myself as a dude in a dress, and it's kind of liberating :) It doesn't stop people from misgendering me, but at least I feel comfortable with myself now. Before I felt that on days when I feel male I HAD to dress more male, because otherwise people would think I was faking being GQ, and also I felt like a fraud myself. But then I started reminding myself that dresses aren't womens' clothing. They're just clothing. Anyone can wear them. I am who I am, regardless of my clothes."
genderqueer,3bpkzc,esmemori,3,Wed Jul 1 09:38:53 2015 UTC,I'm glad to hear you're comfortable in your identity and clothing choices. I do think you're underplaying how hard it can be for people who are afab but identify as masculine/male though. It's not that I 'want/feel the need to fit into the traditional dude gender role' it's that I'm physically so far from what I expect that it's very unsettling seeing all those curves accentuated. And do I choose to shave my legs for work so I don't get comments but then get more dysphoria at home? It's cool for me to wear whatever when I'm really stable but the moment I start getting dysphoria that stability doesn't last long.
genderqueer,3bpkzc,Glarbulock,4,Wed Jul 1 15:15:35 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I do get what you mean. I guess I just expressed it poorly in my comment. (sometimes I tend to leave things out, because I think they go without saying, but then I remember that people aren't mind readers/don't know me and then it's not so obvious what I mean... hehe) aaanyway, I'm afab too, and on male days I would get really dysphoric about wearing clothes that accentuate my curves. (And the ""fitting in to gender roles as male"" was just a side note, I didn't mean that that was what you were trying to do). I still get dysphoric about wearing dresses if I let myself think about it. It happened yesterday for example. Anyway, I guess I was trying to say that I often used to get dysphoric about my clothing too, but since dresses is what I have to wear to feel comfortable temperature wise, I guess I kind of had to get past the discomfort that the dysphoria gave me. My way of dealing with dysphoria is just by not trying to think about it and distract myself. When I get dysphoria, I avoid mirrors at all costs, and I imagine myself having the male body I wish I had. And I also focus on how nice it feels to wear a summer dress that lets you feel the breeze, rather than sweating to death in pants. So basically I try not to focus on the emotional discomort, and instead think of the physical comfort that wearing skirts bring me on a hot day. I realize that might be hard to do. I thin kit might have been easier fo rme, because I've been working for a long time to learn to handle my anxiety and panic attacks, and I use the same technique as I do when it comes to dysphoria. I guess I've had a bit of practise... But I hope that you find a way that works for you to work around the dysphoria!"
genderqueer,3bpkzc,esmemori,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:28:55 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Out of interest what do you do about body hair?
genderqueer,3bpkzc,Glarbulock,2,Wed Jul 1 16:30:37 2015 UTC,"I almost never shave. Sometimes I trim it down a bit (I get really long hairs) because I hate the feeling of your legs rubbing against something and then the friction makes it feels like someone is pulling on your leg hair.. ouch. So mostly I don't shave, or I trim it down to about 1 cm."
genderqueer,3bpkzc,esmemori,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:37:50 2015 UTC,"Huh, I guess I just forget that other people don't have ridiculously heavy leg hair. I think I'd probably look like a wolf in a dress if I tried your style :)"
genderqueer,3bpkzc,Glarbulock,4,Wed Jul 1 18:03:16 2015 UTC,"Does that have to be a bad thing though? Wolfs are majestic creatures! But seriously, would it be bad? I mean, it's just society that thinks leg hair is ugly on ""females"". The fight against it has to start somewhere. The more people stop shaving the more other people will get used to it and stop caring about it :) Actually most of my female friends have hairy legs, and some of them have really thick dark leg hair. It's just a question of getting used to it and trying to ignore society. And also, even if people (idioits) would frown upon it, what are even the odds of them seeing it? I mean, when you talk to someone, how often do you look at their legs? You look at their face. so I don't think people would look that much, and even if they did, who cares? If you want to have leg hair, you should have leg hair! Unleash your inner majestic wolf! :)"
genderqueer,3bpkzc,esmemori,2,Wed Jul 1 21:35:12 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, and when I identified as female I did do that sometimes. Even then though it was still awkward at times because my leg hair is so thick it would even get comments on a man. But now when I work somewhere that people will definitely notice it (trust me) and it will prompt endless conversation about physical appearance, which is likely to worsen my dysphoria, I'd really rather not."

genderqueer,3bpkzc,dagalmighty,0,Thu Jul 2 01:22:29 2015 UTC,"Consider this maybe: if you're gender neutral, why does that mean you need to butch it up to be genuinely presenting your gender? Why does presenting in a feminine way seem so different than presenting in a masculine way? Is it possible that you feel like you have to to counter your afab body? Or is it because a masculine identity just inexplicably seems more authentic (troubling in a is-this-internalized-misogyny? way)? Because that doesn't actually seem very gender neutral at all.  I say wear whatever you want, even if it is a dress, if it's comfortable and you feel like you look fly in it."

genderqueer,3boc39,Glarbulock,5,Tue Jun 30 20:46:10 2015 UTC,"If your gender changes from time to time, that's fluidity. Genderfluid doesn't have to mean you switch between a discrete number of genders. It can also mean that you drift around the spectrum freely and wherever you are, you are. Like most gender, it's usually discussed in terms of the binary genders, but that's too narrow a lens.   As for the difference between fluidity and bigender or trigender, you'd have to ask someone else… but I think the difference might have to do with how discretely the switching is?  As far as I'm concerned, you can identify however you want. I didn't see the post about why ""pangender"" is problematic though."
genderqueer,3boc39,aoeui-dhtns,2,Tue Jun 30 22:09:51 2015 UTC,"Okay. I thought that fluid meant that you only are one gender at a time. I sometimes feel like several. I actually like pangender, because it feels right. But there were a few people who said that there are cultures that have several genders that i as a european white person can't understand and that it's racist to call myself pansexual because ""pan"" means ""all"" and all include these cultural genders that i don't know about and don't have the right to use. But to be fair that was only two people. There was also people who said that it doesn't count as racism.   I know that pan means all, but I didn't think it had to mean ""all"" in a literal way. Just like, I identify as pansexual, but I haven't actually been in love with a large enough number of people to cover EVERY type of  identity and gender."

I can kind of get behind those who dislike certain terminology but to not to acknowledge your gender because it isn't traditional to your culture is way more offensive to me than any ""appropriation"" that might take place. Something existing in a particular culture doesn't give them a monopoly. I wouldn't pay much attention to the opinions of such people."
genderqueer,3boc39,KTcube,2,Wed Jul 1 04:18:07 2015 UTC,"Okay, phew! I think that sounds reasonable too. And since  the two of you who commented so far had never heard of pangender being problematic, maybe I can assume that it's just a few overly PC people that think pangender is an incorrect term.... Or at least I hope so hehe. I'm just a bit worried that some people will assume I'm an inconsiderate asshole just because I use that term to describe my gender identity. But I think it seems unreasonable to be expected to be feeling like ALL GENDERS EVER to get the right to call oneself pangender. Just like I think it's unreasonable to have to have been in love with ALL THE different kinds of people to get to call oneself pansexual."

In my experience, being totally up front about being genderqueer (and explaining what that is, if necessary) helps you weed out shitty guys who aren't worth your time.  I wasted a lot of my youth fucking around with gay dudes who wanted me to be something I couldn't be.  It wasn't until I began being honest about my gender (and presenting how I wanted) that I actually met guys who were loving and respectful of me. My dating pool definitely got significantly smaller when I came out and started presenting more genderfluid, but the quality of it improved drastically.  After dating openly as an AMAB genderqueer for a couple years and having a few short-term flings, I eventually met my current boyfriend at a party and we've been together 6 years. I knew he was a keeper because he went out of his way to educate himself on non-binary genders after I initially explained my gender to him."

Whatever you present like or do some people will resent you for it. If you wear blue jeans a lot of people will be okay with it, some will love you for it and some will straight out hate you. It's like that with everything. The way you present should be in a manner that is okay with you and you will attract the people that are okay with you. Fashion is a way to present yourself to the world and to tell the world who you are without them having to ask. And it doesn't matter who you are trying to date. It works like that for everyone. Of course if you go 100% mainstream you will be able to get more dates but they will be crap. Mostly... Because you present something that you don't live. and that causes problems later"

Body   simple white tank top underneath an Underworks extreme compression tank (gotta flatten them boobs) my everyday skinny jeans UO men's shirt (from my everyday closet) UO men's hoodie (also my everyday closet. I buy a lot of dude clothes. THE WHOLE STORE IS MY STORE)   Face   color correcting face primer BB cream coverup (this is all to create as flat a base as possible so I can mold my mug into a dudely shape) Contouring cream just below my cheekbones, on my temples, underneath my jawline, on the sides of my nose, and underneath my eyebrows to create sharper features and a flatter bridge to my nose, as well as a heavier browline Cream stick theater makeup and a stipple sponge to get the stubble illusion. This took about 4 or 5 attempts before I figured out the right shape for my face.   The whole process (disregarding the hour or so it took to figure out my facial hair) took about 45 minutes. It looks much more convincing in pictures than in real life, so that's the next challenge!"

genderqueer,3bfetl,uraniumbender,2,Sun Jun 28 19:09:49 2015 UTC,"Hey there! I was also AMAB and am non-binary! I have found making changes to my appearance does help people not read me as male, though that's their fault more than anything. It's also difficult though because the common narrative of ""androgynous"" is someone who was AFAB with a masculine look. You'd think that  it would be the opposite with AMAB people, but it doesn't really seem to work like that, you either need to balance carefully what is female or male coded OR remove anything coded at all from your wardrobe.   Jumpsuits and overalls help definitely as do cardigans and hoodies. Sweaters and shirts with lower than usual (for male clothing) cuts can work. For tops, what I usually do is look in the women's section for things that strike me as ""tomboyish"". If you have an overtly masculine top, loose fitting clothes might be a go to. If you have narrower or medium shoulders, some snug tops made for women could make you look cute as well without making you look like a woman.   Eyeliner can go a long way and isn't necessarily feminine. I like to line both my top and bottom lids with semi-thick lines, no wings and the result is strikingly androgynous ;) Darker lipsticks help as well. Also, if you want people to not read you as a boy you might want to keep your face cleanly shaved. I have a wicked five o clock shadow that people see and immediately think I'm male.     What's your hair situation like?   Also, all that being said, just be yourself! If you want your outside to match your inside, don't be afraid to try out heaps of different things until you find a look that resonates with you! If you're comfortable with the way you look already, people can get fucked if they think you're a boy!"

And I found myself wanting to be male so I could have that friendship.   This seems similar to my dysphoria.     I'd feel crappy if I outted myself this way only to realise    Does it have to be all-or-nothing?  Can you experiment with it a bit more over time to see if it's something you like?"
genderqueer,3bdzjs,interiot,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:54:08 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I worry if I experiment I just put a bunch of people I know and care about through something only for it to not actually be a real thing or that big of a deal. Especially with my SO."
genderqueer,3bdzjs,interiot,3,Mon Jun 29 20:39:01 2015 UTC,"IMHO, it shouldn't be that big of a deal to experiment for people to experiment with their gender a little, sort of a ""lesbian until graduation"" thing.  You won't know yourself until you explore a bit.  That's just my take."
genderqueer,3bdzjs,SphirosOKelli,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:57:51 2015 UTC,"For me that feeling was caused by a subconscious and nagging feeling that even though ""I was okay with my body, didn't have to be male all the time, only wanted to do hrt for a couple of months, etc"" deep down I think I knew that this was going to go further for me. At first I wanted to fight it. But at some point I decided to go for it. Binding and packing are very subtle forms of experimentation that showed me a lot about myself. Experimenting with stp has lead me to realize that despite my initial declarations, I might want bottom surgery. I'm out to a few people by choice, no one else even really notices.   If your SO is worried that he is repressing you then put his fears to rest and start playing around with things. Even if you just do all of it at home I suspect you will find it comforting. I would say that for me though, experimenting has given me such joy and So much more dysphoria. Now it's like all of the things I thought u could deal with, I realize that I am tired of dealing with them. I'm just so ready to switch over...  And I completely recognize that gender fluid is a thing, and transition is not a given or even a direction you have to head in. But not allowing yourself to explore your gender will only prolong your feelings of confusion. In the end you deserve to know who you are and what makes you comfortable whether that's bi gender, gender fluid, transmasculine, or straight up FTM. You owe it to yourself and your SO to take some time to reflect inwards and find your true self.   Best of luck to you on your journey!!"
genderqueer,3bdzjs,queerJo,2,Tue Jun 30 14:37:55 2015 UTC,"AMAB here with quite similar experiences. I never really got why men and women had to be separated in school for sports. I just went with it and was neither happy nor sad about it. But from that point on I kinda experienced that I didn't fit too well with the boys. At that time i though everyone felt like that. I just felt that I was something else thrown in with the boys. I never could put my finger on it. It mostly was that my testosterone worked different. I wasn't as reckless, not so much power driven and never really cared about who was stronger or who won. I just accepted this and I think that I neglected a part of myself by doing this. I should have acted on this more. At the same time I felt stronger about the girl energy. I always enjoyed hanging out with girls more than with boys. Just because I felt more at home with them. But at the same time girls could annoy me as much as they can annoy any boy... I felt more accepted when I was with the girls, less of a ""cheat"" (which I felt around boys) but I never fit 100%.  So that was my childhood ans teens - since then I have discovered that something like genderqueer exists and that I am probably that. I accepted that I will slowly have to find out what gender I want to be. And this is very hard for me because my unconscious is overprotective. Which means I will unconsciously protect myself from something that I think might hurt me - and in this process I might hurt myself even more. Its a weird kind of thing but I figured that out ages ago... So about a week ago I felt ""normal"". I was okay with the way I dress, with my body with everything that I am. And I don't live out in any way. I present as a male. This kind of came to a shock to me because those situations are so rare now. Few days later I felt really dysphoric about everything. I don't know what triggered this but it just happened like this. And this gave me a really bad time. For around a year now my gender has been switching all the time. Like a manic depressive person. sometimes you feel overly male then just overly female. and sometimes inbetween. I can't figure out why it does that but it just happens. As I said my mind protects me from a lot of things so I suspect that I just need to wait a bit longer and try and survive this. Because this is really hard on my nerves. I am not kidding. I guess it is my inner coming out process that is just harder than for other people...  I feel like I dont want to do HRT and SRS at any point. SRS because I have something that works for me. And 95% of the time I feel like I wouldn't be happier having any other sexual organs. I would probably just feel the same about it. HRT because I might want to have children at some point. I would love to get rid of the hair on my arms and legs, to have a rounder form overall. I couldn't handle breasts though because I can't imagine coming out at the moment. And anything that is too much out of the male norm is just emotional pressure that I couldn't handle right now. I would like a lot of things about HRT but shooting blanks and breast growth keep me from doing it.  At the same time sometimes there is this inner pressure that keeps growing that wants me to do more about my gender. I try and act more female whenever I can. I sit differently. I stand differently. and that kind of helps. But I think my dysphoria is growing and at some point I just will have to accept my being trans. whatever trans then turns out to be for me. Maybe I am a fullblown transgirl. I can't tell yet. And maybe I am ""just"" genderqueer. Or maybe I am already where my journey ends and I am genderfluid.  I don't know if this helped you. I just wanted to ramble a bit more because I felt that a few months back I was feeling the same way you do, and having the exact same thoughts. And then it all got different. So maybe you can relate. Sorry for my words not being so well chosen and my text structure not being the best... Its the best I can do right now - for reasons.... You probably read the whole thing but if you didn't  edit: I forgot that you mentioned your SO. Not I am not the best to give relationship advice. I have been single for quite a long time now and before that I was pretty much a player. The last relationship I was in I kind of was unhappy because I felt that it often didn't give me what I needed in a relationship. I always had to be the male. In pretty much all aspects and I could to it sometimes but most times I didn't want to be. Even during sex... So I got dysphoria a lot. And sometimes I felt really crappy when I was feeling forced to do something that I didn't feel like doing. So my advice is: In a relationship you need to be loved the way you are in order to be able to look in the mirror every day. If this isn't happening for you any more and your relationship gives you some too much dysphoria it is no longer beneficial. I loved my last girlfriend. She was sooo cute and lovely. But she just wasn't able to see what I need. And so it didnt work out.  TL;DR: It's probably not the end of you gender discovery journey and you are in for a lot more. I'd just try and listen to your inner gender and act on it a little bit more whenever you feel like it. But I still haven't figured out my own stuff so ... I am not the expert here"
genderqueer,3bdzjs,queerJo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:11:28 2015 UTC,"This does help a lot. On the part of my SO, we've been together for five years. We're pretty firmly attached. Also, my dysphoric episodes aren't really all that frequent or all consuming. I've tried to tell him that I don't need to be masculine all that often and I don't even need to be masculine around him, but he just interpreted that as him forcing me to hide who I was anyway. It's funny that the reason it's so hard to talk about this is that he cares about me a lot, but he somehow can't get it out of his head that being with me = repressing that side of me.  Edit: Sort of an unrelated note, but a lot of me starting this thread and having these issues more recently stems from a housemate of mine at university who is transgender MtF. Basically one of the first times the idea of ""genderqueer"" was brought up around her, she went on about how it wasn't a real thing. Then a few months later the topic came up again and while they seemed more accepting, she just kept going on about how genderqueer people should stay out of trans spaces and just ""do there thing over there"". It made me feel that a lot of my experiences in life was just me being, I dunno, not genuine I guess? But that just caused me to spiral into more dysphoria."
genderqueer,3bdzjs,Sspaghettiandsand,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:43:39 2015 UTC,"I know the feeling you get around ""real"" trans people. The way I see it there are liberal trans people and conservative trans people. The liberals are open for everyone. The conservatives need their boxes. Probably the first time trans* was included into LGB people were saying stuff like ""its not even about their sexual orientation! what do those people want under our umbrella?"" It's natural to resent that what you don't know. It's a reflex that saved lives in the past and still saves lives. It's wired into our biology. So don't judge anyone on their first reaction. But some people will not open their boxes giggedy for other concepts. Some heterosexuals still refuse to believe that homosexuality is actually a thing. In our day and age it's really easy to find out what homosexuality is and how it works. and some people refuse to acknowledge it in any way - and those are the conservatives. And you get conservative gays, conservative trans*, conservative genderqueer. Once you blow the roof of their box to show them where you live they get scared of the sky. Some overcome it some don't. I recently went to a self help group for trans people and I will go again in a week... so last time some were looking at me like I was a fake trans. I didn't fit their box. Or most peoples box. some actually got it. So I am really excited what will happen the next time I am there... I felt a real good connection with people there, but I am still scared that they could kick me out because I am not ""trans enough"" - whatever that would be... And yes that definitely also triggered some dysphoria for me. I felt really really weird about myself after getting the looks of ""he's not even trans""."

There are a set of rules that people are pressured to conform to. I understand the invading spaces very well. If I have my binder and man contour on I will not use the girls room. I generally pass as female and am completely out at work. But the thing is I also pass as a man onstage and probably would on the street with light makeup. I present only female offstage.  The privilege to pass in multiple spaces means you should simply be incredibly respectful to your environment and don't scare the cis people. If my presentation gets manly at all, I will then avoid women's spaces. Don't feel simply like you are invading, just be respectful.  As for knowing, the farther you go in your journey testing the boundaries of your gender, you should have some sort of internal response. If you are agender, gender fluid or bigender this may be tricky because day to day these decisions on presentation may not be the same.   Do you present genderqueer with your binder, or male? It may be worth doing some extra contour and presenting more masculine if only to see how that makes you feel. I have makeup tips if you want them.  As someone who goes back and forth daily with 2 sets of mannerisms, I understand the confusion and doubt that can creep in.  Feel free to reply here or pm.  Xoxo.  Here is halfway out of makeup.

Best advice I could give from my limited perspective is to just try things out.  Think of every new aspect of gender you would like to change as a little experiment.  Set yourself up each time you try something new to attempt to evaluate how you feel about it after a week or so.  If you like it, keep doing it.  If you don't like it, stop.  If you think you like it, but you feel awkward, you might have some things you can sort out about yourself and some bias or social pressure you feel (real or otherwise).  Personally for me, this test-->learn-->test-->learn process got me to the point where I lost a bunch of weight, grew my hair out, and now I have nearly a year worrth of 1/2 dose HRT.  I may not be ""out"" yet but I sure present myself a hell of a lot differently than I did several years ago, and I am pretty sure I feel happier about it.

genderqueer,3bcdgo,WinterAyars,3,Sat Jun 27 23:56:01 2015 UTC,"Coming from AMAB but I figured I would chime in.  I currently take about a half dose of anti-androgens and estradiol to the point where my levels of both sit halfway between the generally accepted baseline ranges for cis people.  This works quite wonderfully for me as far as I can tell at this point.  Regular blood tests show everything doing great.  My body seems to take to E rather well as I swelled out to a B cup and suddenly have hips and a butt which I never really had.  From all I can gather, the current thoughts on bone loss following low sex hormones is that as long as you have some levels of either or both you should be fine.  As for you and your specific concerns, I saw this thread on asktrans a while ago about the drug Raloxifene which is in a class known as selective estrogen receptor modulators.  Basically they either block or stimulate estrogenic effects in different places around the body.  You could probably talk to your doctor about trying something from this class of drugs to modulate the effects you are trying to achieve."

If you move to one of the cities or liberal havens (including Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Olympia, and of course San Francisco), I think you'll find the difference to be amazing.  You can still find social conservatism in rural, military, or 'rich' (beachfront) areas, but on the whole the people here are beyond tolerant.  In fact the bigger challenge for you might be navigating the social encouragement for him to 'fully' transition.  How bad is it there?  Are you worried for his physical safety as he moves up through school?  Or is it 'just' the constant low-level disdain from family or acquaintances who know he's biologically male?"

As he ages I'd like an environment where he isn't the only kid he knows like himself. Presently we are driving nearly an hour to have playdates with other non conforming kids, and we live in the largest city in the state. Trying to support a child on the journey is different then those at other stages, we have much support from older trans folks, but his mental and physical safety are the biggest things right now. I'd also love to live in an area where adults throw their hate at me rather then a six year old. We're looking at the Eastern side of WA, I'm thinking even that has to be better then here right now.

I wish you and your family all the best! I'm only replying because you mentioned eastern WA. This is what I've heard: it is completely night-and-day compared to Seattle/western WA. Super conservative, esp. Spokane! And awfully close to the haven of white supremacy that is northern Idaho. This is what I've heard from WA residents that I've known. Maybe someone else can confirm or deny.  In CA, where I've always lived, the further east you go, the more conservative it gets. I know it's a generalization, and it's true that being on the coast does not guarantee the gen pop is open-minded and not bigoted. I've spent most of my life in San Diego county and as a lesbian I pretty much only felt relaxed about my identity when I lived in the city itself. I lived in a smaller city ~ 20 miles north of SD during the 2008 election and was surrounded in my neighborhood, and bombarded while driving, by the pro-Prop 8 signs. I never felt so discriminated against. I spent 10 yrs in Northern CA, ~ 50 miles north of SF, and found it quite relaxed and comfortable there. I hope you find an awesome place to establish your new home. Good luck!"

There are some bigger towns/cities, but they tend to be by no means open minded. Western WA, some cities named above, would be significantly better, IMO. There's even camps for young gender non-conforming folks! And alternative schools where a lot of kids might identify similarly, as well as a rather large Queer population to connect with!

The parents group that we are part of also has two trans kids that I know of and they seem to have had little issues with schools and such.  I would say the tone for any conversation about trans issues around here is more that of it being the annoying ""educational conversation"" with ignorant people rather than outright transphobia which you are probably familiar with."
genderqueer,3bchkl,nitegirl99,2,Sun Jun 28 11:34:55 2015 UTC,"thanks for the comments and insight. My husband has PhD options at WSU and family north of Spokane, so that area has a huge draw. I think we've decided to rent for 6-12 months before we commit and leave ourselves an out. I hear you on the rural issue, I do think that a smaller population magnifies dysfunction and bigotry. We are planning to fly out and visit for a couple weeks but I don't think that will give us a good feel for the area. At this point our son isn't trans, but I don't know where his path will lead, I should probably look up medical care and trans friendly doctors. Emory is starting a trans specific practice and I hate to leave that behind but...we need a change."

I've considered agender as well, but I feel like I have a sense of gender in me, not a lack of one..I like (trans-masculine) neutrois to describe this feeling of not being quite male or quite female, but often leaning to the masculine side of things. I don't really mind being mistaken for male, but I don't like he/him pronouns, so I prefer they/them instead. With that said, it is okay if your pronouns do not necessarily ""match up"" with your gender. I am AFAB and do not mind or care when someone calls me a female or she/her, even though I don't see myself as female. You can use whatever pronouns you feel most comfortable with.  Although trans-masculine neutrois describes me well, I think I prefer to just simply go with non-binary/genderqueer to describe me. It gives me space to breathe and feel whatever I want to feel. Whatever label fits you, claim it as yours. Good luck!"

Agender means not identifying with any gender. People who identify as agender often express themselves as androgynous, but I don't see why an agender person couldn't appear more feminine or masculine in their gender expression. Of course I can't answer this question for you; gender is definitely a thing someone has to figure out on their own, but at least people who've already gone through the rigmarole can kind of point in a helpful direction.

genderqueer,3b1ych,PoeticallyInclined,7,Thu Jun 25 08:55:31 2015 UTC,"I'm going to quote parts of the article, so if anyone reading wants to understand the whole context (because it is important I believe) I encourage everyone to read the article before my comment. Warning: there is self harm and suicide mention near the end.   One popular theory about why little boys are more aggressive than girls is hormonal differences. I was just as aggressive as any little boy, and I liked games and movies that involved fighting. Did I envy the culturally specific power of a male character (the captain of a ship!) or was I born with actual physical differences—like in my brain and the chemistry of my body—that made me behave more male than female?   It seems like many genderqueer/non-binary people are like this too, fitting biological differences suited for the opposite sex than they were born, and I think that's just part of the beauty of human development. Like Intersex people, we probably have the same natural hormonal differences, either our whole lives or just during development, which affect our gender like trans people, only not always in the same ways. And considering the theories coming out of research on trans and GQ/NB people, it seems like this is what's being supported by the data.    I have heard the argument that no trans people would want hormone treatment or surgery if societal views of gender were healthier—if, for instance, people were more willing to accept someone's correct gender just because that person fucking tells them that is how they identify. While I absolutely think practicing this kind of acceptance is the right way for people to conduct themselves, I would no more tell someone they don't need surgery to express their true gender than I would tell a child they should wear a dress because they have a vagina. I believe every person has a deep need to manifest their identity in a way perceptible to others, and I would not question their means of doing so unless they were harming someone.   This is why I believe that the restrictions on transitional therapies need to be changed severely. In understanding the bigger picture, I found the number of people who have detransitioned over the years to not be significant enough to be a logical deterrent to keeping the droves of trans and GQ/NB people from the surgeries or hormones we need to live. And informed consent would also help because, well, there are other kinds of surgeries and medicines people get put on that do long term effects on their bodies and they get it covered by insurance and such, why shouldn't we? Basically there needs to be better access and insurance coverage because people who are like my girlfriend or I, who have thoughts of self harm because of our gender dysphoria, don't deserve to suffer, and no one should be pushed to things like suicide either. I'm tired of our siblings dying because we don't fit into their outdated boxes.   I'm far closer to ""man"" on the gender spectrum than ""woman.""   I feel this on a cosmic level with my centre of being."

Recognition means rights are coming, and I love their perspective. But it makes me envious too. I'm consistently nonbinary, and I feel like we and others get erased because media only recognizes male and female components of gender. Like, articles like this are awesome because they amplify voices that need to be heard, but I don't think news outlets recognize all the voices that need to be heard. I hope they will get to us soon."

genderqueer,3awp1f,Thatdoctorperson,4,Wed Jun 24 03:47:25 2015 UTC,I only do it when talking privately with other members of management.  I know the other managers try to say they but rarely remember. I'll ask the next time I see them at work just to be sure. I just want them to have a good work environment and how I can make that the best for them. I know it's a crappy retail job but I'd like it to be the best crappy retail job.
genderqueer,3awp1f,Thatdoctorperson,5,Wed Jun 24 03:56:22 2015 UTC,"I'd like it to be the best crappy retail job.   Can I just say you are the best manager ever?

It sounds like what you are doing at the moment is great so good on you! I'm just going to say it again... I have fears about working because I'm genderqueer but you have managed to actually make me realize that it could actually be good, keep being great. Just keep up the communication with your employ, make them feel welcome and I'm sure it's the best crappy retail job they'll ever have!"

If there is a uniform that's different by gender, let me pick an outfit, or mix articles from both outfits. If I'm gender fluid or bigender, I might need to wear different outfits on different days, or take a quick break to change.   I'd also appreciate if each person got my pronouns right, but I wonder whether I'd want you to correct people. I assume I'm out to everyone at work? If you do correct someone, it's best to do it in private. I don't want to be held up as an extra special snowflake. I'm just a regular employee with unfamiliar pronouns. If there is any official written communication like a news story or a blog post, please make sure the writer, marketer, journalist, etc. knows my pronouns.   I think you could bring ideas like these to your employee and ask what they think. Ask if there are other ways you can be accommodating."

They get to pick all their clothes except the retail shirt, which they choose to wear the men's version and although we do not have a neutral bathroom they are welcome to use whichever they prefer. I think they use the women's bathroom because its frequented much less- we have about 4 men for every woman at work.  Thanks to a comment in this thread I think I have the words to ask about the pronoun usage, without it being awkward for them."

Most days it's just irritating, like when you find some random gendered item and think ""WHAT IS THE POINT OF GENDERING A SPORTS DRINK!?"". And then there are some days when it really makes me sad that everything is gendered. Today I thought I'd go to the mall to find a plain gray hoodie and some kind of bathing suit since I don't want to go swim in the nude hehe. The gray hoodie hunt failed, because men's (i'm afab) hoodies are way too big for me. It looks like I'm trying to hide under some kind of blanket with sleeves. And I noticed that many stores didn't even have gray hoodies in the womens department. They were all neon pink, or blue etc, and the few gray ones that I found were form fitting and showed of all my curves etc. I got very frustrated so I gave up the hoodie hunt and thought I'd try to find a bathing suit. But no. There are NO bathing suits what so ever. Just bikinis. And I don't want a bikini, because they make me feel naked and slightly dysphoric. And even though I would prefer wearing the ""male"" alternative, that's not an option, since I'm not too keen on getting arrested for going bare breasted.  UGH. This ""gendering everything there is in the universe""-thing is getting a bit old now... Please, someone, make it stop."

And also apparently a criminal"" Where I live it's illegal to go without a top if you're female. It's allowed for men, but if a woman is seen without a top it counts as disorderly conduct... If you want to go without a top you have to have a man without a top present aswell, because they will mostly only ask the woman to put a top on, and then you can claim it's illegal to treat people differently just because of their gender.. But that won't work unless there's a guy with you, because then they can say ""well we WOULD HAVE told the other person too if he was here. but he's not."""
genderqueer,3au1x1,Unicornsparkledust,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:05:03 2015 UTC,"I definitely miss being able to go shirtless. My parents let me swim without a top until I was 10.

Also have you tried looking in more of sporting goods store for your hoodie?  They might be more likely to carry a plain grey women's hoodie that isn't super form fitting.  If you still can't find what your looking for and then men's XS is too big you could always try the boy's section."

And yes, I've looked in the three biggest sporting goods stores in the town where I live haha. No luck yet. And a XS would work if it wasn't for my body shape. The problem there is that if it fits my arms and stomach it sits really tight over my hips and boobs. And if it fits my boobs and hips, it looks like I'm a stand in kangaroo that could fit several baby kangaroos in the belly pouch. And my arms disappear in the sleeves...(I have an hourglass shaped body, which makes me look weird in clothes that are sewn for a body with no curves)."

The color options in the women's section for items like hoodies or pajamas or plain tshirts or even running shoes, are usually pastel or bright colors.

The mens tshirts were available in blue, gray green, white and black. The womens shirts were available in pink and mint. Why?? I would have liked a blue one, but i didn't want to order one that was too large. And i bet that there are people that can't wear the smaller womens sizes, that would still like a pink shirt. And also, why didn't the girls get to choose from 5 colours too? Blaaaargh. There are so many things in society that annoys me right now. I wish I could just turn my feelings and my brain off for a while when I go shopping. I really don't see the point of gendering things. NO ONE benefits from it. But some people feel hurt by it."

genderqueer,3au1x1,special-measures,9,Tue Jun 23 17:54:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, well. I think it's really complicated. Yes, it does bug me. I should be allowed to wear what I want. But then again, sometimes I want things exactly because they are supposedly for the opposite sex. I love wearing pink stuff, but maybe if I was FAAB, I would totally reject it for the same reasons why I now love it.   I am neither a strict gender essentialist (which would be unfair to all the gender non-conforming people) nor a strict gender constructionist (which would be unfair to all the binary trans people). I think there is probably a reason the gender roles exist. I think gender has reproductive, neurological, psychological and social aspects, and they don't necessarily align as we all know here. I think it can probably be said that certain things are typical for a given gender - but that's just statistics. I think over the millenia, culture has taken those small differences between genders - which are really rather insignificant compared to the differences between individuals - and amplified and escalated them beyond recognition, ultimately arriving at the bizarre standards we have now as to what is ""for men"" or ""for women"".   It's hard to tell what's cultural, what's neurological and what's psychological. It seems from experiments with young primates that boys tendencially liking ball games and girls liking dolls might be a neurological issue - although of course individual boys and girls might deviate from it, and should absolutely be allowed to do so. A preference for pink and blue, on the other hand, could not be established in experiments with children or animals, and seems to be a 20th century social convention.   So, maybe there are some things that appeal more to the average man or woman. And there's really nothing wrong with that. But I see society as a collection of individuals. And each individual should be free to like what they like without having to make some huge statement. If I want to paint my nails or wear a skirt, should I be considered a ""sissy"" or ""transvestite""? Personally, I'm actually fine with both, but it shouldn't have to be that way. People should just be allowed to like what they like, wear what they want to wear."

Evolve or die!  The most gender neutral place I have ever shopped at was Costco, of all places. It's probably due to the barebones nature of setting up clothes, though. They seem to arrange it by clothing type (jackets, sweatpants, jeans, socks, etc.) with the ""mens"", ""womens"", and kids stuff all side by side.  Also, $12 jeans! Quality jeans!

genderqueer,3au1x1,TheOneDoc,2,Tue Jun 23 18:09:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is the main reason I hate society. I (almost) never get along with other males, as I think most are complete idiots. I'd say less than one tenth of all males I meet of my age (15) aren't able to say anything but synonyms of ""seducing"", ""feces"" or ""genitals"" every third to fifth word (this is NOT an extreme exaggeration), and even less people that I share interests with. What bothers me more is that even in schools (Physical Education), they either send you to a boys' class, or girls' class. The only mixed classes are for those in band and get gym every other day, and those optional grade 11 and 12(The only reason being very few females sign up for that class). A run of 2.6km in 28.30 minutes  is a B for a 14 year old female, C- to F for a male of the same age. I'm surprised that they have a ""acceptance of gender diversity policy"". It's OK to be trans and be unathletic, but if one's effeminate, you're given crap. Back from elementary, they separated you. Not physically, but labeling. There were ""girl push ups"" and ""push ups"" (now known as ""smart push ups"") I was defecated on by the teachers for doing them instead of a regular one. Even between the two homes, one parent is an anus, and the other is an idiot. The orifice is of the ""Silent generation"", and doesn't like me being non-masculine. When I do act in certain ways, or can't move certain heavy object, he calls me ""sissy boy"" and some other things, trying to ""man me up"". My mother now no idea how gender identity actually works. She thinks gays are that way because they want to do feminine things! I've refrained from wearing certain things, like a light blue rain jacket with a grey and pink inside after one day because of people saying ""It's a GIRL's jacket,"" and being afraid to be harassed even more. I actually like frill on clothes, still hug my teddy bear when I'm feeling down, enjoyed dance class but stopped.. I've thought more and more of this recently, and thinking about whether I'm OK with being physiologically male, and only want to be allowed to act myself and don't actually want to rid myself my own flesh. I think I could quite easily pass of for female though, with a bit of waxing and hair lengthening. I don't actually like hair anywhere other than the top of my head, but afraid of more disapproval doing Smyth ng more than a slight shave. Besides, I wordn't want to spend two hours a week for the rest of my life to some therapy session. I probably need it as I am.  On top of that, I've labeling myself as asexual for some time. I told both my parents about this, unlike the previous thing. My mother wanted me to record me saying that I'm not sexually attracted to anyone, trying to prove me wrong I'm a few years. She's religious (and young earth creationist,) so it is to be expected. My father knows, and frankly doesn't care, as it should be. I always thought I was heterosexual, but lacked any actual attraction. Anything I did show was the pressure from being the only person left in my gene pool on my father's side.  On one final note, I assume that gender dysphoria is more of a thing coming from society rather than gentals and body issues in SOME cases, and because of other pressures.  Screw you nature, you've f*cked up. (Again)  You know, I think that I could probably make a whole other thread with this rant.  (Edit: I got off topic again, didn't I?)"

I know at least that some cisgirls have a very clear idea of what they look like, and are constantly engaging in (what sounds exhausting) self-monitoring- I look best from that angle, I should sit here in relation to that light, I should smile just so to look best.

genderqueer,3akgnu,Day-of-Light,7,Sun Jun 21 02:07:12 2015 UTC,"There's no way you'll be happy hiding yourself for someone else in the long term. Relationships come and go, but you will always need to be true to yourself.   I think the first thing you should do is promise to take care of yourself. Get up right now and go look in the mirror, and tell that person you're going to be on their side, always. They are worth your love.   Then, when you're ready, go on and tell your boyfriend. He will either accept you or he won't, but if you don't tell him he won't have the chance. If you keep hiding, he won't be dating you but just an image you're presenting. And you deserve someone who wants you.   How to ease into it: I think, talk to him about people like you, like news stories or TV characters (if you can find any). Feel it out a little. If he talks like he can't possibly accept you, it's OK to just let him go. Otherwise, give it a shot."
genderqueer,3akgnu,aoeui-dhtns,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:26:28 2015 UTC,"Easing into it in the way you described is probably the best way to do it - at least then I can quickly get a good idea of whether he'd accept me as I am or not. Right now I feel like I'm two people at once, not just in regards to him but also in regards to most of the people in my life: I'm both who they think I am/expect me to be, and my true self who falls out of the boundaries I've been placed in. I feel like I can only show one side at a time, but hopefully soon I'll be able to be my true self around everyone.  You're right, though, I do deserve to be with someone who'll love who I really am and not just love the facade I put up out of fear that my real self won't be accepted.
