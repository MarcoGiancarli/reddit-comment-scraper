HalfLife,3e21yb,Ducksen,8,Tue Jul 21 10:27:55 2015 UTC,"I think it's far from a good desktop wallpaper to be honest. The illustration is cute and is clearly the thing you spent the more time working on, which I understand, but the rest suffers a lot from it. The composition is really off, everything is too close from the edges. The half life logo looks like it was rushed in microsoft paint. I'd suggest you use a vector version and then use textures/shadows to make it more interesting rather than fully trying to freehand draw it. And lastly, the kerning of the font is off, I don't know why you put this huge gap between the two words but that doesn't look good. I understand this is just a quick drawing without pretention and I hope my criticism is constructive enough as I don't mean to be rude or offensive. Keep up the good work!"

HalfLife,3e4bg1,whats_not_in_a_name,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:38:43 2015 UTC,"i am sure there are some texture mods, but honestly all the ones i have seen just look weird.   there is the official half life HD pack made by gearbox which i think comes with the steam version (you can turn it off and on in the menu i think)  which updates a lot of the weapon and character models   http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/half-life/images/a/af/Barneys.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090506003751&path-prefix=en  i personally prefer the HD pack as its a nice update that still keeps the feel of the original. but most other mods i have seen dont really look right.   this conversation is old now but maybe can help you out:  http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1793765  there is also half life: source which i do NOT recommend. its essentially the same exact game as the original (same models and everything) but ported over into the source engine. firstly, its known to be really buggy, and secondly the updates it makes just look weird. for instance it replaces all of the old water textures with realistic water, which sounds good but to me just looks really weird and out of place in the otherwise low graphical environment. the other thing it adds is physics, which essentially just means when things die they turn into rag dolls. this also looks weird, as in the original everything had a death animation, in source the rag doll physics don't look right with the super low-polly models. its just uncanny to me. infact this port was so disappointing when valve first released it its what inspired the black mesa mod. you can try it out if you want, see if you like it better then the original, but i (and most others) dont. (although i must admit, its really fun to pin people to the sealing with the crossbow lol)  so yeah thats pretty much all i have to say on the subject."

Map sizes would be tiny, and so a lot of events would have to be split into many many maps. Physics would be terrible, and the gravity gun would just amplify the problem. The game probably would NOT like a lot of large and small entities running all around a huge map like happens in a few parts of HL2.  Basically: Really hard to make it be playable. The Source engine, even in 2004, was much less limited as far as just about everything. Map sizes were bigger, entity limits were bigger, model quality was better, sound quality was better, physics was better. You would have a terrible experience if you ported HL2 to GoldSRC."

It's really hard to do that without just dropping you into the respective subreddit.   Hype with titles like HL or Fallout tend to be quiet, below the surface, and largely unnoticed until actual news comes up.  Pay attention to just about every major gaming outlet next time anything about HL3 is rumored. Most recently, the Oculus stuff and VR tech demos Valve have got a bunch of outlets talking, plus (I think it was) Samsung's announcement that they'd ""worked with Valve on HL3"" got a LOT of news groups talking.  We're also talking about a game franchise that has produced some of (if not the) highest rated games of all time. No shit people are hyped."
HalfLife,3dyzm0,Max_Valentino,-2,Mon Jul 20 20:53:37 2015 UTC,"There was huge hype for fallout 4 years before it was announced, not just on their subreddit. Due to the scale and replayability of bethesda games the fanbase stays healthy and active way longer. I was on the fallout subreddit a few years ago when that hoax was going on and that hype was larger then anything i have ever seen on the half life subreddit. Hl3 may have had that kind of underlying hype a few years after e2 but it sure doesnt now.  Also you are saying hype stays hidden and then reveals itself when a game is announced, not at all. There is little hype, and then the game announcement makes new hype. Yeah when half life 3 is eventually announced there will be tons of hype, but not now.   As for news outlets always talking about it when there is any sliver of news, thats because half life 3 is like a legend at this point. Of course any article about it will bring in views. However this is very different from people activley looking foward to it with high expectations.   Also my main point is that hype has not been building due to the wait. People act as though the long wait for half life 3to is making people think its going to be huge and groundbreaking. People say ""they have waited so long they cant meet the built up expectations"" but i havent seen anybody who has rising expectations the longer the wait is, if anything expectations are going down."

HalfLife,3dwnfx,House_of_Suns,18,Mon Jul 20 03:59:57 2015 UTC,"GLaDOS is a psychotic on a war path, but not downright stupid. If she preconceived the Combine invasion, she knows she would be fighting an uphill battle so unbalanced it's practically vertical. It's better for her survival if she keeps the site secret, descending into obscurity and testing what subjects she still has. Besides, assuming the neurotoxin incident happens sometime right before/after the Resonance cascade, Chell wakes up some 10-20 years later and defeats her. In retrospect, a decade or two isn't that much time to really do anything with your power limited to a single facility underground and without any specific type of major offensive or defensive weapons."
HalfLife,3dwnfx,Goofybud16,9,Mon Jul 20 04:31:41 2015 UTC,"Actually, I Top10Memes Top10Facts video on Portal has pretty good evidence to suggest that Chell was in suspension for 50k years.  Both from Valve employees working on it and in-game things.  So I think that maybe GLaDOS DID predict that BM was going to cause some sort of catastrophic event (Maybe a warning from GMan) and killed off all the staff so that the combine wouldn't invade and destroy Aperture labs. The combine attacking Aperture? That would end very badly for everyone inside. Black Mesa was fairly heavily armed and they were taken out, Aperture had turrets. That is it.  And based on the events, I think HL1 took place in the early 2000s/late 1990s. I think the events of Portal happened not long after. I believe that the combine herded all the humans to Europe for easier control, and GLaDOS just closed off the facility so BM assumed that something went really wrong and everyone died, but nobody could get in or out. At the end of Portal, the Combine had already herded all of humanity (outside of Aperture and any similar bunker type buildings) to Europe, so when GLaDOS ""died"", they didn't think much of it/ignored it as something blowing up because nobody was maintaining it. The combine were busy with the resistance, and then their portal is closed. They are ultimately defeated. 50k years later, GLaDOS wakes up, humanity having come back to the Americas and recovered from all the damage the combine did. Hence you are thrown out into a wheat field.  Alternatively, everyone hiding in their bunkers comes out and recovers the land (Fallout style, everyone who survived is in a vault) and the combine is occupied with the resistance in Europe, and as they rely on local transportation, they cannot get to NA, or plain don't care about the humans there as they don't want to screw with the combine.  I think that either way, NA is repopulated by humans who have fixed what was damaged by the combine while defeating (most) humans and herding them to Europe. This is why Aperture labs is reduced to an outhouse and become farmland, they just knocked everything down and started from scratch.  Assuming that Aperture was only down for 10-20 years, and the announcer was wrong and the time changed in development, I don't think that Gordon will run into Chell. Shortly after the events of HL1, the combine herd all humans over to Europe so they can control them easier. Everyone who is still in NA is rebuilding life while the combine are dealing with the resistance. At the end of Portal 2, it has been 10-20 years since Portal 1. Lets just say 20, and Chell gets out of Aperture the same day Gordon closes the portal. I don't think they will run into each other. The combine is very obviously not in NA, or anywhere near Aperture, as there appears to just be a peaceful field that isn't destroyed/decaying like everything you see in HL2 is. The combine are busy in Europe, and humans are rebuilding life in NA, as the combine have destroyed communications between Europe and NA (No internet/computers outside of BM/Resistance, most is radio operated) the people in NA assume the combine just wiped everyone else out and nuclear bombed the crap out of Europe or something as everyone who has gone there didn't return. Chell will run into these humans who are probably unaware of what is going on.  Assuming that the combine ARE in NA and somehow missed Aperture, Chell will be (if anything) part of the NA resistance. The resistance in HL2 never mentions anything outside of European regions the game is set in, so the resistance in NA and Europe are probably disconnected. Assuming that they DO make contact after something like the portal closing (WTF just happened guys the portal closed????), Gordon is going to be heading to the Borealis while NA still has to deal with the combine forces there. The combine have been hit pretty hard in Europe, but we don't know how powerful they are in NA. Assuming that the NA people didn't go wild because of Gordon Freeman, they are still very much in control. Chell would have to have a repeat of the events that take place in HL2->Ep2 (or similar) before she could then head to the Borealis and possibly meet up with Gordon. That sets Chell back several days, which gives Gordon and friends plenty of time to take control of the Borealis and destroy it, which would mean that Chell would have no reason to go there.  So far, all the storylines I can think of result in Chell and Gordon never meeting each other. Yes, they are in the same universe, I just find it extremely unlikely that they will run into each other at any time in the foreseeable future. They are either separated by time (tens of thousands of years) or by insane distance (NA vs Europe)  The only way I can see them meeting up is if Portal 1 takes place after the events of Episode 2 and HL3. The combine are defeated, and someone goes missing from the Resistance. They wake up in Aperture labs, and begin testing. Which would mean that Aperture labs somehow still existed for the 20 years that the combine controlled the world. Considering the fact that they have flatscreens while everyone in HL2 and the episodes have CRTs, it is possible that they locked down the facility. There is no history in the game for Aperture between the 1990s and whenever Portal 1 takes place, so it is possible that Aperture locked down for 20 years until the combine were defeated. They developed a lot of new technology and even stole some of the combine's technology (the energy ball). In this time they developed faster smaller computers (like you see in Portal 1), created a bunch of flatscreens, etc.  Basically, there is a lot of things in the way preventing Chell and Gordon from ever coming in contact, and I think Valve did that on purpose. They don't want them to."
HalfLife,3dwnfx,A_Wild_Wurmple,3,Mon Jul 20 05:50:50 2015 UTC,"The combine attacking Aperture? That would end very badly for everyone inside. Black Mesa was fairly heavily armed and they were taken out   OPPOSING FORCE SPOILERS  It sounds like you're saying that Black Mesa was taken out by the Combine, and if you are saying that, they weren't. Black Mesa was destroyed by a nuclear bomb in Opposing Force."
HalfLife,3dwnfx,Goofybud16,2,Tue Jul 21 00:32:31 2015 UTC,"Ah. Still need to beat Opp Force.  Either way, the combine were able to overwhelm everyone, even the armies of the world.  Aperture Labs doesn't stand a chance. All of the armies in the world were defeated by the combine."
HalfLife,3dwnfx,Pain_Fly,6,Tue Jul 21 00:58:46 2015 UTC,"Definitely an interesting theory. Unfortunately I don't think anyone, Black Mesa included, knew about the Combine ahead of time. But still... What if?"

Maybe she felt something bad was going to happen, but personally I think it was just a coincidence."
HalfLife,3dwnfx,CyanSheepMedia,5,Mon Jul 20 05:54:18 2015 UTC,"Predicting the Resonance Cascade was likely. In the alternate universe where Cave Johnson buys out Black Mesa, he states that he is stopping the anomalous materials research because they could cause a Resonance Cascade. But as you say, the Combine is very specific."
HalfLife,3dwnfx,Audioverstaerker,2,Mon Jul 20 16:32:38 2015 UTC,"I think this is plausible. In half life 1, before you went in to do the experiment with the sample, even one of the professors was saying that 'the chance of a resonance cascade is extremely low'. This means that they already knew it was possible and could happen. GLaDOS with her super-super computer power might have evaluated the risk more realistically than black mesa did."
HalfLife,3dwnfx,Empty_Allocution,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:26:03 2015 UTC,perhaps Caroline had knowledge of the Combine somehow   You must read my theory on this relationship! - It's here at Chapter 4  There must be some kind of relationship between Aperture and the Combine prior to the resonance cascade. My thinking is that the Gman stood as a middle man and passed technology from the Combine to the humans.
HalfLife,3dwnfx,shrekinator,3,Mon Jul 20 06:23:41 2015 UTC,"But Aperture science has more advanced teleportation than the Combine, which is why they want to find the Borealis. How do you fit that in?"
HalfLife,3dwnfx,Empty_Allocution,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:38:22 2015 UTC,I don't believe the Combine knew about Aperture. I think it was solely the Gman (or some other party) passing technology across to humans.
HalfLife,3dwnfx,babyavery22,2,Mon Jul 20 15:02:54 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, I don't really believe Aperture had knowledge of the Resonance Cascade or the Combine before anything happened, unless the G-Man or his employers said something. Also I think Aperture may have found something in their work (whatever is on the Borealis) that is too dangerous to be used by anyone, so they may have tried to get rid of it and played it off as an accident. Or it actually was an accident, im really not sure. But either way the CMB found it and will probably use it."

Not very talkative, but not mute. They'll even try to come up with all sorts of explanations for why he's mute (he's autistic?

HalfLife,3drkbh,darkpivot,10,Sun Jul 19 03:30:37 2015 UTC,"I agree. its not that the character is silent and cant be shown talking, its that we are essentially the character so no talking film version could live up to your imagination.   and i agree it should be done through another viewpoint. i actually think an anthology movie (kind of like cloud atlas) where we jump back and forth between different characters and stories happening at the same time during the black mesa incident would be really cool, and the actions of one of the characters in one of the plots has an indirect effect on the characters in another plot, so we know why something is happening but they dont.   and people will often say the seven hour war would make a good movie, but idk, how would you end it? i mean obviously it would have an unhappy ending, but the story needs some kind of arc. we wouldn't really see that arc until the events of half life 2."

You don't know that much about him. But you know he's a crucial figure and a hero to many. And maybe once or twice you cross paths with him.   He's definitely not the protagonist of the film. When he's on screen it's in the background, maybe talking to Barney or a scientist or something. The rest of the film is about a normal person's fight against the alien and the combine."

HalfLife,3dpx49,TreuloseTomate,4,Sat Jul 18 08:18:48 2015 UTC,"I am really excited for the Vive, the only thing I am not a complete fan of is how you actually have to walk around.  I can use a DK2 (borrowed one from a friend) in TF2 just fine without feeling sick.  I would LOVE to replay a re-made Half Life 2 with a Vive. All the little details, the rubble, crumbling buildings, etc. I don't know how I feel about the limited movement based on a room though. I would prefer a Steam controller/KB+M control method alongside it. If they can integrate a Steam Controller/similar into the VR handhelds? Yes please. You can use the VR handhelds and move around in smaller rooms, and stick them together to make a steam controller for when you need to move larger distances."
HalfLife,3dpx49,Goofybud16,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:07:51 2015 UTC,on top of walking around i am personally not a fan of the motion controls... i would rather just use a normal controller with the headset rather then waving my arms around.
HalfLife,3dpx49,whats_not_in_a_name,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:41:20 2015 UTC,"Same.  I wouldn't mind some sort of motion/normal controller hybrid, or if the motion controls are optional.  I just don't like the idea of having to walk in a small area to play. It really limits level design. I like HL2 with the giant maps that are huge and long and seem to just keep going. You just keep moving forwards and it never seems to end. You end up going in a circle, and it still feels like you just covered a ton of distance. I don't see how that would be possible if you had to walk that far. 1) Nobody wants to walk the f**ing huge distance covered in HL2. Or the episodes. Or HL1. You cover a LOT of ground. I don't see how you could make a first person shooter without having large maps like that. With portal it might be possible."
HalfLife,3dpx49,Goofybud16,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:18:09 2015 UTC,"honestly even the environments in portal are way to big to be confined to a small room. you would need to design something specifically for these limitations, so i could see maybe one really great game using this, however after that i feel like its just a creative dead end.   maybe something like small and horror themed like PT, as its very confined and would be scary as fuck if you were actually walking around (would be cool if the map would generate specifically to match the basic shape of your house)   but i mean other then that, cant really go to far.   i also see it a huge safety hazard, there will inevitably be a website called ""VR headset death counter"" counting the people who have died from tripping and slamming their face when they were awkwardly stumbling around with the headset on.   idk, i am liking the vive less and less the more i think about it lol  maybe i am just not creative enough to see the kind of amazing things you could do with it? idk."
HalfLife,3dpx49,whats_not_in_a_name,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:01:33 2015 UTC,"I like the Vive. As far as we can tell it will be the best headset available for the next ~year after release.  The 3D tracking system it uses allows you to be tracked anywhere in a room, VS. others that just have a camera. You aren't required to use the Vive in a way that makes you walk around. I like this more. It means that I can use it, as an example, while not sitting directly in front of my desk. I can mount the sensors a bit farther out, and sit in a lot more places in the room. Combine that with the possibility to do hand tracking/controller tracking and it becomes really cool. I think that if developers don't try to force you to walk around, or wave your arms around like an idiot, it will be great. You don't have to use the hand things, I think you can use just the headset. If they can do controller tracking on Steam controllers (something you plug into the controller) so that they can see who has what controller? (if it supports multiple people on 1 set of sensors) That would be cool. You just have some Steam controllers, everyone grabs one, and it can match each controller to one headset. There are all sorts of cool things you can do with the tech, I just feel that forcing you to walk around isn't the right thing."

HalfLife,3dpx49,Goofybud16,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:28:17 2015 UTC,"yeah, valve said that actually walking around gives you a lot more immersion. if a game can work that way, you will probably have a better experience with it. but if it doesn't work for a game, they just wont do it that way, I don't see this as a problem. especially because devs probably want their game to be compatible with both big headsets, and I'm not sure how well the rift works with walking around (with the out-of-the-box one camera setup)."

HalfLife,3dpx49,EngineerDogIta,4,Sat Jul 18 10:08:44 2015 UTC,"Well, completely moving around a virtual world with your arms and legs would be pretty much impossible. I guess you could stick with your standard controller/keyboard controls though."

HalfLife,3dpx49,EngineerDogIta,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:23:04 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think that's already technically possible with the Vive's setup. Stick a few of the trackers from the headset and controllers onto your arms, legs, and torso, and then the base stations should be able to track your entire body in 3D space with a few software tweaks.  Dang, now I really want the Vive to come out so somebody can try this."

HalfLife,3dpx49,MationMac,3,Sat Jul 18 10:35:40 2015 UTC,"I think there's potential even with the limited movement typical of VR. Imagine, say, a VR puzzle game set in Aperture with game mechanics meant to seamlessly compliment VR's movement style. If done well, you probably wouldn't even think of the movement as a limitation and instead see it more as a game mechanic. The demo seemed to pull this off pretty nicely, so I wouldn't be surprised if a full game of this kind is in the works."

HalfLife,3dsagc,Diehard50,7,Sat Jul 18 23:44:54 2015 UTC,Valve made the next step in video games with half life 2. It was a innovative masterpiece.  They just want to do it again. That's the reason they take so much time for this project. Sure they could release episode 3. But I think it wouldn't be enough for the fans.  They just want to show us that they still can bring a quality game that is much better and more innovative than half life 2 was.
HalfLife,3dsagc,drunkn_master,4,Sun Jul 19 00:32:15 2015 UTC,"one problem though is that they want to be innovate via some kind of multiplayer or social experience, and while some concept ideas like the crossing seem cool in theory, i feel like multiplayer is just at a creative dead end. it really saddens me that valve insist on ""pushing the social experience"" because, in my opinion, the single player experience has almost always been better. you cant really have a deep thought provoking philosophical narrative when you involve multiplayer, it just doesn't work. so i think they might be trying to do something innovative involving multiplayer, but haven't been able to figure it out."
HalfLife,3dsagc,whats_not_in_a_name,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:44:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I'm all for Valve continuing to explore new multiplayer and social experiences, but I fail to understand why it has to be this mutually exclusive thing where they've convinced themselves that a single player experience can no longer stand on its own.  Everyone knows Half-Life 3 would sell like crazy even if it were just single player.  The demand still exists, as Wolfenstein demonstrated, and the Half-Life brand would take care of the rest.  Same as Fallout 4.  And even if that market has changed since 2007, this is a chance to be the trendsetter again, instead of following in the footsteps of what everyone else is doing."
HalfLife,3dsagc,Riomaki,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:26:48 2015 UTC,"exactly. if they want to experiment with multiplayer they absolutely can, its just they seem to think its the only way to go, and might be completely done with single player all together. that just makes me sad :(  i mean lets be real here, in terms of quality valves single player games are far above their multiplayer games. you cant really compare tf2 or dota to half life or portal, they just aren't on the same level imo."
HalfLife,3dsagc,whats_not_in_a_name,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:17:56 2015 UTC,"Multiplayer games are just as high quality, but for different reasons.  In singleplayer, the story, the setting, the narrative, everything affects fun, and the experience delivers a rich story through voice and visuals, as well as scenarios. In TF2 and DotA2 you can replay endlessly for insane fun, and the story is more mute during gameplay, but rather delivered through SFMs, comics, biographies, and voice lines during gameplay. The story is less important, but a larger focus on gameplay and teamwork. The quality of single player is impacted by every element, while in multiplayer all that matters is character and level balance/design, and is unqiue due to every decision, combination, and bits of cooperation that happen."
HalfLife,3dsagc,ThatOneSlowking,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:33:42 2015 UTC,"while i would agree they are equal in quality terms of programming, game play mechanics, and fun, i was mainly referring to their artistic integrity. no offence to the creators, but i don't think i would ever call something like tf2 art. really fun maybe, but its not a piece of art like half life or portal, its just a game.   people could argue a game being fun is more important then a game meaning something, and you could look at it that way, but in my opinion you make a game fun in order to keep a player interested so you can convey your meaning, themes, messages, ideas, story, etc. the same way you make a movie entertaining for the same effect.   when you make something that's just fun or just entertaining, you could make it really really really good, super high quality stuff, but it will still be shallow.   I do not mean to suggest making something that's just fun is a bad thing, of course it isn't, however valve is taking it too seriously and are looking for something new and innovative in multiplayer that in my opinion they aren't going to find.   as i said already said, i find multiplayer to be a creative dead end. at least in terms of large groups of people versing each other. maybe they could pull something off with coop, but not much else.   i have yet to play it but i hear that the game journey uses multiplayer amazingly for artistic reasons, as after you beat the game you get to go back and help others on their journey, becoming the mentor to them and completing the journey of the hero by literally bringing what you have learned back.   thats a great innovative idea. but how many more great ideas are there for valve to find?   again, maybe i just don't have the creativity or imagination to see the possibilities, but as far as i can tell multiplayer is just not the best place to look for something new."

It's very possible they agreed with your assessment and we're looking for a good solution to this exact problem.

HalfLife,3dpebj,OfficialDaBlaze,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:16:21 2015 UTC,Ask yourself something. Has Valve ever done this in a Half Life game? No. So I highly doubt they will. Also I'm sure they know it makes people pissed.
HalfLife,3dpebj,EngineerDogIta,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:14:27 2015 UTC,"Valve doesnt make decisions like :""HEy That MOVie Had CineMAtiC 30 FPS with DoF we shuD Probably puT DoF On Our GAEM"", No, they probably care more about the gameplay than the graphics, and if they do its a gameplay design concept. Just look at the half-life series and tell me if there are useless disturbing effects while playing, even the Hdr, it's something that helps you to see in the game, not just a post-effect that gives you a cinematic feel"

HalfLife,3dmtm9,Pain_Fly,2,Fri Jul 17 17:59:24 2015 UTC,Excluding Half-Life: Before?
HalfLife,3dmtm9,WazyCartoonist,13,Sat Jul 18 16:40:28 2015 UTC,"Um no, it isn't the shaders holding the game back. The game has descent enough shaders and shadows, the problem, like with all games, lies in the textures and more importantly, the polygon count."
HalfLife,3dmtm9,HalfLife1MasterRace,4,Fri Jul 17 17:13:48 2015 UTC,In my opinion shadows are the games worst problem..
HalfLife,3dmtm9,Cyspha,2,Fri Jul 17 22:41:12 2015 UTC,"I know shaders aren't holding the game back. They are decent as well as textures. But if they were to make a port I don't think they would make new textures or models, but the shaders and physics would be updated with the new engine."
HalfLife,3dmtm9,HalfLife1MasterRace,14,Fri Jul 17 17:34:56 2015 UTC,This is the same reason why people hated Half-Life: Source. Do 4k resolution shadows and detailed shaders really make a difference if they're next to a blurry texture or a triangular model?
HalfLife,3dmtm9,Manleyman69,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:54:14 2015 UTC,"I guess not, but I just wanted opinions. IMO I don't think it made much of a difference in HL1, but it might be a little better in HL2, which has better textures and models than the first. Better, but not the best."
HalfLife,3dmtm9,Half_Finis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:11:00 2015 UTC,"The point is that the textures are outdated by modern standards, just like they were in HL1 when HL1: Source came around. Whether they are better or worse by HL1's standards doesn't factor into it."
HalfLife,3dmtm9,LOCKJAWVENOM,16,Sat Jul 18 07:52:01 2015 UTC,Ye
HalfLife,3dmtm9,Riomaki,6,Fri Jul 17 15:40:05 2015 UTC,"I think the opposite. HL2 has GREAT lighting. What holds it back is the texture resolution and map geometry. Although I would play it just 'cause, HL2 on Source 2 wouldn't actually be much of an upgrade. It would be the same case as HL:Source unless textures, models and maps were upgraded."
HalfLife,3dmtm9,LOCKJAWVENOM,3,Fri Jul 17 18:30:53 2015 UTC,HL2 has great static lighting.  It's dynamic lighting that the Source engine struggles with.
HalfLife,3dmtm9,Olympian_One,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"It has good lighting, but I would like to see what it would look like in the new engine."

HalfLife,3dmtm9,nihilinth,3,Fri Jul 17 18:41:47 2015 UTC,"I think that even if Valve doesn't make it, someone is going to re-make or port Half-Life 2 in Source 2. It's bound to happen just because of how popular the game is."

HalfLife,3dmtm9,ethosaur,3,Tue Jul 21 01:29:43 2015 UTC,If they improved the geometry. The biggest thing that makes HL2 look dated is how everything looks boxy.
HalfLife,3dmtm9,Vrabo,2,Fri Jul 17 23:19:54 2015 UTC,I guess some of the stuff is a little low poly but I don't think anything is extremely boxy.

HalfLife,3dmtm9,wolfcl0ck,5,Sat Jul 18 08:25:10 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, It would be just like playing Black mesa source, just for hl2."
HalfLife,3dmtm9,Goofybud16,11,Fri Jul 17 15:44:37 2015 UTC,Wouldn't a better comparison be playing HL source? It would just be ported over - Black Mesa was a co.plete overhaul with new models and textures.
HalfLife,3dmtm9,briggswag,2,Fri Jul 17 16:22:48 2015 UTC,I would imagine they would do quite some overhaul too.
HalfLife,3dmtm9,kamil1210,2,Fri Jul 17 17:41:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, though I don't think it will be as much of an upgrade BMS was, I imagine probably the same textures, animations, and everything, just better physics, lighting, shading, reflections and all that. More like HLS was to HL1, instead of BMS which changed textures, models, anims, sequences, AI and basically everything (nothing was ported over for BMS)."

HalfLife,3dmtm9,OfficialDaBlaze,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:54:47 2015 UTC,"IF they do something like BMS, yes.  If they do what they did for HL:S? Maybe.  I honestly think HL:S looks like total crap, and it has no HD texture packs available.  So if they actually put some effort into it and don't just throw it through a porting script, fix any bugs, and call it good, then I would. If they DO just run it through a script, probably not, unless Source 2 magically makes the game look better than HL2: Update."

HalfLife,3dk8i7,TheJonesReddit,6,Thu Jul 16 23:04:41 2015 UTC,"Cold-blooded asshole... See I don't like the way Gordon was portrayed here. I don't believe he would just sit around for two weeks doing nothing, plus her father died, and you don't behave like a stone-hearted fag. You hug her right now!"
HalfLife,3dk8i7,YakusActual,2,Thu Jul 16 23:11:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's what he meant. If you think about it, Gordon was 20 something, and Alyx was a baby before the Black Mesa incident. Gordon would still see her as a Eli's daughter. I doubt that would change Gordon's mind 20 years later when she's all grown up.  And I agree, Gordon was portrayed as an asshole in the comic, and wasn't given the proper words to hand the situation properly and/or maturely.  As for Gordon sitting on his ass all day... I don't quite understand that part. But, I can imagine Gordon and Alyx staying at White Forest a while long to bury Eli, and pay their respects. but I highly doubt that after all that, they'd wait any longer. As I said, I didn't create the comic, I just thought it was an interesting point he/she was trying to get at."
HalfLife,3dk8i7,eRock9202,3,Fri Jul 17 00:05:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about the whole relationship between Gordon and Alyx.  I am actually surprised that I don't see or hear more people discussing it to that depth.  This is how I see it, coming from someone who didn't follow the Half-Life story until several years ago.  Gordon had a slightly more-than-coworkers relationship with the Vance family back at Black Mesa; only second to his relationship with Barney.  Alyx was young enough at Black Mesa to remember seeing and interacting with Gordon (as to why she doesn't remember the incident, I point to the G-Man's line of ""...plucked her from Black Mesa,"" but that's a whole other storyline).  Gordon obviously remembers her.  Fast forward 20+ years.  Gordon reappears exactly the same to everyone, but everyone else has aged.  Eli is older and Alyx has grown into a woman.  I see Alyx's view of the relationship as more of an older gentleman kind of crush that I see girls go through.  With her, the crush feelings are unfortunately coupled with the fact that Gordon is her dad's friend.  This would explain why she pulls back her feelings and blushed when she talks about how she is worried about Gordon. Gordon, on the other hand, does see Alyx and an attractive woman his age.  Her aid and companionship is an added plus.  However, she is still Eli's daughter.  Gordon can go from seeing her as a beautiful and intelligent fighter one moment, then suddenly see her as the young child he interacted with when he when over to Eli's place.  The dynamics get even more complicated now that Eli is dead.  Alyx needs a comforter.  She is looking for someone to love.  She is also looking for a family now that she is the only blood she knows.  She can't decide if she sees Gordon as a soul mate, a protector, or a best friend.  Gordon wants to do what is right, but it seems like all he does is cause trouble.  He may even blame himself for Alyx getting hurt in the first place.  He doesn't know if he loves her as a friend, a sister, a guardian protecting a child, or a woman to start a family in the future.  I think that there are so much dynamic and complex emotions between Alyx and Gordan that Marc Laidlaw probably doesn't even know exactly how they end up; the possibilities are endless.  I guess this goes to show you how good the Half-Life story is."
HalfLife,3dk8i7,kyller3030,2,Fri Jul 17 03:24:08 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of good points on this, and I'd love to discuss it further, but... I need to think about this for a moment...  I try and stitch my emotions into Gordon's and make it fit his reality. I actually asked Marc about Gordon's mental state a while back if you want to read... (he replied)  But, if I was Gordon... I wouldn't know what to think. I'd be confused and, worried. I wouldn't want to put off the wrong signals. I'd just need to approach this like a stirred hive. Careful, and calm. And with Eli's death, as you said, I wouldn't know what to do. I guess it would have to be the player's decision in the future? I'd tell you to ask Marc, but I doubt he can say anything yet.  And you're right, it's such a good story. I can't wait for the continuation. Whenever Gabe get around to it. Which should be soon...  (I'M JUST MAKING A GUESS)"

TT If it weren't for him, none of the trouble of what has been happening would be there in the first place, so sad for Gordon... :( He would rather die than carry on his legacy of failure he brought on Black Mesa and I understand that complete, no lie. :) Very good, I love it so much and this DEFINITELY deserves a Fave, I love it so much!

HalfLife,3dk6we,luis_ma,9,Thu Jul 16 22:51:53 2015 UTC,"Quoted from this subreddit's wiki:   The official order of the Half-Life games is as follows:   Half-Life, or Half-Life: Source Half-Life: Opposing Force, Blue Shift, or Decay Half-Life 2 Half-Life 2: Episode 1 Half-Life 2: Episode 2   It is recommended you play the games in this order, however you can still enjoy any of the games if you haven't played the games that come before it. If you are going to start with Half-Life 2, you can find out all you really need to know with a simple Google search .  Notes:  Half-Life and Half-Life: Source are the same game ported to different engines.  Opposing Force, Blue Shift and Decay all take place during the same time as Half-Life. Between these three games, there is no set order to play them in.  Lost Coast and Uplink have been omitted from the list as they are generally not considered canon. It is debatable whether Opposing Force, Blue Shift and Decay are canon, but they were included anyway (see the ""Are Half-Life: Opposing Force, Blue Shift and Decay part of the Half-Life storyline?"" section of this FAQ for more info).   Also, I would like to include my own input and say that you should play the original version of Half-Life 1 rather than Source, which has been wrought with bugs and faulty porting since release. Afterwards, complete the standalone expansions (Opposing Force and Blue Shift) first if the first game pleased you, or move directly to the sequel if you feel on the fence but want to give the series a second chance; many fans believe that Half-Life 2 mended some of the first game's flaws."

I recommend playing HL1 first.)  And Half-Life 2 update which fixes bugs and improves lighting, or Cinematic Mod which many people around here don't like but you can try it (play HL2 first.)

HalfLife,3dh4p8,OfficialDaBlaze,19,Thu Jul 16 05:55:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with almost everything you said; except that he had something to do with Elis death. In HL2:Ep2 when Vorts were saving Alyx and Gman could talk to Gordon, it seems, that he actually tried to warn Eli through Alyx that something bad will happen. Either that, or Gman and Eli were working together and ""Prepare for unforeseen consequences"" was some kind of a signal for Eli to do, or prepare for, something."
HalfLife,3dh4p8,buttlickk,17,Thu Jul 16 07:30:43 2015 UTC,"Now that I think about it more, I forgot that Eli was going to tell Gordon something about the G-Man, so that might be the reason why he targeted Eli. Not because the Vorts."

HalfLife,3dh4p8,THEMikeyBeef,13,Thu Jul 16 12:39:12 2015 UTC,"I think its definitely an interesting, and original theory, but I would disagree on a couple of points.   If the Vorts are the ones holding Gordon's contract until the end of HL2, why would they need to free him in Episode 1? They hold his contract, and can free him at any time. It's like Breen said - Gordon's contract is open to the highest bidder.  How would the G-Man get the hunter to kill Alyx? That would assume that either G-Man has some form of working relationship with the Combine, which strikes me as rather unlikely, or is able to manipulate the hunter in doing his bidding. If that is the case, why wouldn't G-Man use his ability to control events directly more often? It would almost render Gordon to be irrelevant."
HalfLife,3dh4p8,YakusActual,2,Thu Jul 16 08:52:07 2015 UTC,"Didn't G-man say something about this in HL2E2? He has to abide by certain ""restrictions"". What if part of this was that he couldn't interfere too much unless there is no other possible way for Gordon to continue his mission without a little extra push?"
HalfLife,3dh4p8,PrinceCheddar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:45:18 2015 UTC,"You make some good points. Maybe the contract went for as long as the citadel stands. We don't have too much information as to what the contract entails, so it's hard to say.  As for controlling events, we still don't know what he is after or why, so maybe it will be revealed as to why he needs Gordon in the next Half Life."
HalfLife,3dh4p8,alekcacko,-4,Thu Jul 16 09:13:03 2015 UTC,Its easy with the hunter. Gman has unlimited powers he could reprogram it as he wishes w/o combine knowing
HalfLife,3dh4p8,IDCh,10,Thu Jul 16 12:40:50 2015 UTC,"I think the events of the first game were more important to the G-man than just  testing Gordon. I think, before the incident, G-man wasn't really interested in Gordon, and as things played out he was analysing everyone. Only when Gordon repeatedly proved himself did G-man pay attention, and at he end of the game, offer him a job.  I also don't believe he made a deal with the resistance. I think he placed Gordon in City 17 for his own reasons. At the time, he wanted the Combine on Earth weakened, so he placed Gordon in a time and place to make him most effective.  After the end of HL2 G-man felt it was best if Gordon went back into stasis, probably planning on using him later on. But, the Vorts believes he would still be useful on Earth. It's a risk/reward situation. G-man wanted Gordon safe to be used at a later, more important time, but the vorts were willing to risk Gordon'd death for the potential benefit having him around for episode one +.   Originally, G-man felt annoyed, since it went against his plan, but as Gordon continued to work effectively and not get himself killed, he decided to just let things play out for the time being.  I have a theory on the nature of G-man and his employers, but I'm replying from my phone ATM and don't want to do it right now."
HalfLife,3dh4p8,TreuloseTomate,2,Thu Jul 16 09:35:22 2015 UTC,but the vorts were willing to risk Gordon'd death for the potential benefit having him around for episode one +.   Just ask how many times were I killed during the episode 1 :P

HalfLife,3dh4p8,Empty_Allocution,5,Thu Jul 16 07:23:33 2015 UTC,More evidence.
HalfLife,3dh4p8,Reguerk,5,Thu Jul 16 13:00:07 2015 UTC,"It's a valid theory, but I think you're underestimating the amount of influence Eli has over the situation. Eli merely expresses mock surprise at Gordon's return, and seems to know about Gordon's stasis (as he explains Breen's dictatorship, which would be obvious even if Gordon were in some other part of the world). Then, in Ep. 1, Eli ""doesn't believe"" that Alyx could find Gordon, implying again that he somehow knew about Gman's initial plans to take him away at the end of HL2. So, what did Eli offer in exchange for Gordon's services? His life perhaps? But for what end?  So I guess the vorts knew in some way, but I don't believe they are the actual ""employers""."
HalfLife,3dh4p8,altafullahu,2,Thu Jul 16 10:23:16 2015 UTC,"True, in fact, Eli might be the said 'highest bidder'. The fact that he knows about the g-man and his not being surprised when Gordon returns just makes you think. And now that he's dead, he no longer holds the contract."
HalfLife,3dh4p8,BorderTrike,2,Fri Jul 17 02:14:28 2015 UTC,I've always been torn about why Eli was killed.  On one hand I think that it's payment for something. For what I have no idea.  On the other hand I believe it's as simple as the Gman not wanting Eli to disclose something to Gordon and allows the advisors to swoop on him.
HalfLife,3dh4p8,Huntario818,3,Thu Jul 16 13:06:20 2015 UTC,Yeah... I realized I forgot about Eli talking to Gordon about the Gman after I posted my theory.
HalfLife,3dh4p8,BorderTrike,2,Thu Jul 16 16:52:45 2015 UTC,"Eli was the ""payment"" for Gordon's own survival that he mentioned in the Heart-to-Heart is he not? Perhaps maybe he tipped off the Advisors with the information to extract that payment? Perhaps now that the Resistance are starting to win, he will start tipping the scales back in the Combine's favour, set up Gordon to do the right things in the Combine's favour unknowingly to Gordon or Alyx on the Borealis. After all, the contract was open to the Highest Bidder, and perhaps the Combine won that bid after the destruction of the City 17 Citadel."

HalfLife,3dh4p8,BorderTrike,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:47:56 2015 UTC,"Javier Grillo-Marxuach, a Lost writing team staffer from the show's first and second seasons, published his experiences about writing for the show, thoroughly discussing his team's procedure. Definitely give it a read if you're a Lost fan, but even if you're mostly curious about story crafting, especially for collaborative projects, this piece gives plenty of insight regarding ambiguously written characters like Half Life's G-Man, so it's valuable for you too.  To summarize one of the most pertinent takeaways from the piece: In season 1 of Lost, there was a mysterious ""hatch"" that the castaway characters tried to break open. The characters and the audience were both on the hook about the hatch's mystery, so it was an effective plot device that generated drama and produced a fantastic cliffhanger after it was broke open in the season's final scene. It kept viewers interested in the show, that was its purpose. However, despite being a focal piece in the show's first season, the hatch's contents weren't determined until production for season 2 began. Grillo-Marxuach posited that affecting the audience's emotions and developing palpable suspense was his team's priority. The specifics weren't important; cooking up an answer wasn't necessary because stellar presentation was their goal. I reckon Lost hit that mark with flying colours.  Likewise, I think Half-Life has stellar presentation value. The contiguous nature of the games; the way levels string you along; the balance of puzzle solving, exploration, and combat; harmonize to form arguably the best interactive first-person experience in gaming. However, Half-Life's story has never been anything special. The first game is a simple Area 51 conspiracy plot. I wouldn't be surprised if Half-Life 2 was pitched as a mixture of The War of the Worlds, 1984, and Night of the Living Dead. Half Life's story has always been ancillary to its main objective - building a good interactive experience.   What evidence do we have about the G-Man's past? Not much. What evidence do we have about his motives? Not much. Is there a mystery to be pieced together. Maybe for Gordon in Half-Life 3, but in the context of being a video game in our world, I'm convinced that there is no answer for ""who's the G-Man"" because Valve yet to answer it themselves.  I've been taught that slippery slope arguments are bad because they don't come full circle, but I think it makes sense to invoke one in this case. If Lost, an epic TV series that prides its self on story telling didn't care about preeminently answering one of its core mysteries, its very plausible that the creators of Half-Life (the original), who were programmers mainly trying to push PC tech, didn't care to determine who the G-Man is, but rather just threw him in the game for the sake of additional mystery (and to show how good they are at animating faces.)  One last thing I'd like to say is that you shouldn't get hung up on solving every mystery in every piece of fiction you indulge. Even if the answer is present, there are usually more valuable things to internalize. I was really frustrated when the internet freaked out about True Detective's ending last year. For 8 hours, viewers were presented with one of the best buddy-cop dramas in recent memory, but some were more concerned with figuring out who dun it. It was the lawn mower guy - I take no remorse in spoiling that."

Still odd that they didn't use something to try and obfuscate it, like a few overlapping textures with varying levels of opacity to make it appear dark and to obfuscate the NPC spawner."
HalfLife,3df45l,deadhand-,12,Wed Jul 15 21:33:25 2015 UTC,"The Dropship used to have a gun that would fire if you were close to it.  It helped mask this by keeping the player away from it, since it packed quite a punch.  That gun doesn't seem to work very well now, though.  In Lighthouse Point, for example, it didn't work at all the last time I played it (and I could just stand there and shoot each Combine as they jumped out), but it seemed to in HL2: Update.  You are right that the actual spawning is pretty janky either way.  I've always liked the appearance and concept behind the Dropships, but in practice, they are next to useless.  Not only do they fly their paths in a drunken manner and take forever to reach their waypoint, but when they do, dumping one Combine every 5 seconds is hardly worth it.  The best use of Dropships is to have them fly somewhere outside the combat space and spawn the soldiers separately instead of having the Dropship do it.  It's too bad the Combine can't use their rappel functionality to depart.  It would be a more efficient deployment, like the HECU, and having them ragdoll when killed on the way down would be funny."
HalfLife,3df45l,Riomaki,7,Wed Jul 15 21:53:19 2015 UTC,"I noticed this exact same thing in my last playthrough.

Maybe dropping the entire pod, which would have slots to fire out of and outward-swinging doors so that all of the soldiers could exit at once if needed, would make more sense."
HalfLife,3df45l,Iustinianus_I,6,Thu Jul 16 00:31:40 2015 UTC,Soldiers spawning out of dropships is probably one of the lowest points in the game. You could tell they didn't have enough time to polish it.

HalfLife,3de3rv,Goofybud16,4,Thu Jul 16 01:03:13 2015 UTC,"Well, it would be more of a spiritual successor if HL2 had turned out as dark as planned. Technically, upon release, HL1 was considered a terrifying horror game for a good amount of it. However, the graphics didn't age well over the years, and kinda went to shit so now it's more of a homely classic game to play than a horror game you can get immersed in.   I wish HL2 had followed its original path of horror and darkness. I felt it had much more character, much more depth than what we got. Seeing the beta build in its entirety spoiled me for when I played RTM HL2. It felt vanilla, like it needed an ""edge"" to warrant a dark feeling. Take note, I still think Half-Life is a brilliant series with HL2 being its very, very strongest entry into the series. I just felt it needed ""more"", that thing being what the beta had."

HalfLife,3dfnab,HalfLife1MasterRace,5,Thu Jul 16 01:21:50 2015 UTC,"The problem with Nuclear Mission Jam is that it's not really used at the greatest moments in the game. It's definitely a great song when listened to on its own, but I will always have memories of rolling my eyes the first time I heard it.  Look, picking up the Tau Cannon is an AWESOME moment, but the music just doesn't fit. Why? Because once you've gotten to the Tau Cannon, you've already killed everything. Nuclear Mission Jam isn't the soundtrack of you picking up the Tau Cannon and then shooting things with it. It's the soundtrack of you picking up the Tau Cannon and admiring the viewmodel while you walk around some rooms pressing buttons and glancing at the ceiling.  Apparently it might have been meant to play at the beginning of Apprehension, but I'm not sure that counts since it only works in the Source port. And while that might be a slightly more appropriate time to play it, since there's at least some possibility of some action going on, I kinda hate the beginning of Apprehension anyway.  NMJ's reprise as Something Secret Steers us...let's just say that the whole sequence at the lighthouse didn't age as well as the rest of HL2 did.  Compare to Diabolical Adrenaline Guitar. You're ascending an elevator, JUST after you killed your first marine, JUST after you got the final confirmation of your fear that the marines were there to kill you. And as the elevator approaches the next floor, this song starts building up, leading into the first REAL firefight of the game. The scene is the perfect setup to the song, conceptually.  And in HL2, as Lambda Core, while a chase scene with the hunter chopper might not be quite as conceptually brilliant as the elevator scene, I love the airboat so it gets me pumped anyway.  Obviously, Vortal Combat is played during a really awesome scene. So that's why it deserves some praise. But then again, so is Last Legs. And Hunting Party. And What Kind of Hospital Is This. And LG Orbifold.  And while we're at it, there are some reused songs that I feel are used well in one game but poorly in the other. I never understood what was special about the area where you hear Electric Guitar Ambiance. Why did a bombed-out minefield with snipers and a grunt, surrounding the mega-tripwire room, deserve such a song? But approaching Eli's lab and hearing Escape Array, it just kind of makes you stop and take in the surroundings, you know? On the other hand, Drums and Riffs makes you feel like a complete badass after launching the rocket, but Tau-9 is just, ""What? Crane? No, this is dumb. Dumb crane."""
HalfLife,3dfnab,TheScyphozoa,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:13:58 2015 UTC,"Right, the placement of the music itself seems rediculous, it would be better fitting somewhere in Surface Tension or Lambda Core, but the music itself, separate from where it plays in the game, sounds much better to me."
HalfLife,3dfnab,HalfLife1MasterRace,2,Thu Jul 16 11:37:07 2015 UTC,"NMJ is great, but it absolutely sucks where it plays. Seriously, it is not a good song to compliment getting the Tau Cannon.  However, I find playing NMJ when you first hit the nuclear silo much more fitting."

People always seem to say that its the darker theme that they like about the early versions of hl2 beta,but what we got is really a very bright game,that deals with themes of oppression and war in a diffrent subtly humorous way,but yet we still call the game amazing,and its probably the best rated PC game ever.So perhaps you are right or perhaps we just like what we cant have better.

However, I've once done a full playthrough without music and it was quite an interesting experience too. Somehow it makes it feel more eerie and strangely real."
HalfLife,3dfd8t,Xeotroid,7,Thu Jul 16 08:16:51 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with you, but I think the music is amazing nonetheless and it fits the game pretty well."
HalfLife,3dfd8t,Dudugs,6,Wed Jul 15 23:20:24 2015 UTC,"I used to like the beta more, until I realized that the darker themes don't mix with HL2's storyline.  Sure, kids working in factories is very opressive, however the Combine is a very advanced alien species and as such, they have robots that can do everything a child does with much more efficiency.  Sure, the manhack arcade is spooky, making people kill eachother, but is it really necessary? It would be much easier to just program some AI for manhacks than set up a complex system where humans unknowingly control them.  And really, it doesn't stand out. It's just another piece of media about a opressive government in a urban area of the USA in the future. Where have I seen that before? While the Beta makes sense if the ones in power were humans, when it's an all-powerful alien species, the behaviour in HL2 is more natural, much more disconnected."
HalfLife,3dfd8t,humanwire,3,Thu Jul 16 08:19:56 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I'm not the only one who didn't care for the majority of the music in HL2. It's really quite bland.   I do like the distorted synths with atmospheric pads used in combination with beats; this to me is the game's musical ""sound"". However, in most cases it could have been so much more impactful and emotionally engaging, melodically. The beats could have been heavier, and the compositions overall more complex (when appropriate). I'm a fan of motifs, and would have loved to hear repeating motifs for different characters, places, and events that evolve over the course of the story like a traditional film score."
HalfLife,3dfd8t,helegad,3,Thu Jul 16 07:14:48 2015 UTC,"I think the Half Life series, Portal included, is supposed to be an exciting tale of science fiction with colourful characters and beautiful environments; they only contain elements of horror and comedy, which help keep them fresh. If I want a dark, twisted storyline, I'll play Manhunt or Hitman.  As for the music, Half Life's score was pretty memorable. I can't really remember many tracks from Half Life 2 except for that okay-ish remix of Half Life's credits music, mainly because of how badly it was mixed down."

HalfLife,3ddx9e,Vrabo,24,Wed Jul 15 14:48:50 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt hl3 will be in Black Mesa. We don't even know where Gordon Freeman is in the world now after G-man teleported him. Also, we already know what we will be doing in hl3. Going to get Judith. The only way we would go back to Black Mesa would likely be if G-man wanted Gordon to, but that's not likely."
HalfLife,3ddx9e,OfficialDaBlaze,3,Wed Jul 15 15:09:06 2015 UTC,"Idk if it's fair to say that it's not likely that G-Man doesn't want him to. BM is the point of incursion, it would make sense that after he gets Judith he has to go back to BM to complete some objective preventing the combine from mounting another incursion.   Idk I guess I haven't really thought about it that much, but I did always assume we'd have to go back to the beginning etc at least as a plot mechanism to explain more about what the fuck is going on."
HalfLife,3ddx9e,ZeroCool2u,3,Wed Jul 15 16:30:45 2015 UTC,"BMRF was more of a vessel for G-Man to open a portal than it was anything else. It doesn't have any special properties to opening a portal or entering another dimension like Xen (that we know of), so we're just as likely to enter a portal in Black Mesa East than BMRF."
HalfLife,3ddx9e,B-24J-Liberator,2,Wed Jul 15 20:19:04 2015 UTC,"Really? The giant specialized room in BM where the portal originally opens doesn't have any special properties? Do you mean there's no special characteristics to that geographical location or no specialized equipment?   I'm genuinely asking, because the giant thingamajig hanging from the ceiling and coming out of the floor seems pretty special/unique. At the very least costly in terms of time and money to duplicate at an alternative location, especially considering the whole post-apocalyptic thing.   That's basically the entire basis of my assumption, so maybe I'm just missing some key plot points that imply the location is unimportant?"
HalfLife,3ddx9e,ZeroCool2u,4,Wed Jul 15 20:55:57 2015 UTC,"Eli was well on his way to duplicating the basics of the machine at BMRF, after all, he had mostly conquered inter-dimension teleportation with Kleiner and some Xen crystals.   Machinery can be replicated."

Realistically, I'd argue the machinery is still pretty extensive for a rag tag group of survivors as opposed to a massive organization, but they got some aliens, so that seems like a fair balance. Admittedly, I haven't played the HL series for more than a few years and I played BM in beta, so plots not as fresh as I'd like."

I did mention that it would have been interesting if the bombing of Black Mesa wasn't canon, though, because I think it would be neat to revisit BMRF so many years after the fact.  If the secret that the Combine is after was at an abandoned, rotting BMRF instead of the Borealis.  Mostly because I personally find it difficult to reconcile the wackiness of Cave Johnson and Aperture with the events of Half-Life.  But since Black Mesa is a smoldering ruin, there's no point in going back."
HalfLife,3ddx9e,Riomaki,2,Wed Jul 15 22:11:20 2015 UTC,"Well the original thought was that Gordon and Alyx would find the Borealis. In Episode 2 you can see Judith Mossman in a snowy area just before the combine storms in. This was assumed to be the next location.  But now, who knows? I know that they should continue the progression of events we were already on before going somewhere else in time.  HOWEVER I think that playing through/seeing the 7 Hours War and initial combine invasion would be spectacular."

The progression of HL2+Eps makes the idea seem farfetched but the continued use of unconscious periods and trains connects the possibility through the series.  I could see HL3 being wrapped up by taking the series back to the BMRF and discovering that Gordon never really left because other than that the story is only really resolved by submitting to the Combine, striking a truce, or destroying them all which would require more games than just HL3 imo."

Ricochet 2. The next time a fan has an opportunity to talk to him, they should instead ask about Ricochet 2 - or if that codeword is getting stale, Alien Swarm 2.

Granted, if Valve takes that steep a dive in profits, they'll probably have to cut their team down dramatically, any games they'll produce after that point will be incredibly rushed, and therefore said games will suck and not be worth playing. And then Valve will go bankrupt, an EA will take over the market with Origin. Games Industry is ruined for an entire decade or more before major changes come about.  Just kidding, there's no way I'd ever stop buying from Steam. I'd rather have that service than HL3 at this point."

HalfLife,3d7ky3,Zorren,22,Tue Jul 14 03:26:52 2015 UTC,"its not much, but when you add up all the small hints we have gotten over the years you can kind of piece it together and see through the veil.  here is essentially everything we know about it:   http://combineoverwiki.net/wiki/Future_of_the_Half-Life_series  really all you need to do is read that, but i will go over the most important stuff here.  its important to understand valves history when it comes to releasing games. They have always had this problem where they would show a game off to soon. either they would change it after they already showed it off, or give it a huge delay, or end up having it stolen. Point is, the final product was always vastly different from what valve had originally shown. Because of this they decided it would be better for the fans if they just stayed completely quiet about a project until the knew it was ready. Infact, this is the very reason we dont have a trailer for the (now cancelled, i will get back to that) episode 3. at the end of episode 1 they had a trailer for episode 2, however the final episode 2 was so vastly different from the trailer they decided not to put the trailer for episode 3 at the end of it.   Valve, are also perfectionists. they are unlike any other company in that regard, in that they demand greatness from themselves. Valve likes to innovate, to push boundaries, to raise the bar. Because of this they will scrap a project after working on it for years and start completely over from scratch. they will do this as long as they feel is necessary to get their games perfect, and now that they have steam they do not need to make games for money, which means they do not need to rush games out for a profit. they can take all the time they want.   when you understand their reason for silence and their strive to perfection, it becomes petty clear why its been so long since the last half life (not to mention they have been building a whole new engine, AND developing VR technology). and when you read all the small snippets we have gotten (concept art, project leaks, hl3 code in other games) its pretty obvious that they have been working on the game, if not recently then at least one point in time."

HalfLife,3d7ky3,Max_Valentino,2,Tue Jul 14 19:20:50 2015 UTC,"idk man, they had more then 40 people working on half life 3 and had created the ""half life 3 core"" team in mid-late 2013, don't see how they could still have all those people working on it at that point in time if they had put it on hold almost a year earlier."
HalfLife,3d7ky3,Empty_Allocution,24,Wed Jul 15 00:47:03 2015 UTC,"Long post incoming. Grab a coffee and try not to get too depressed.  I do not believe it is in development currently. I think development was halted - probably years ago. I'm about to go on in great detail as to why I think this is the case, so bare with me.  They don't know how to finish the story.  Firstly, we've had a lot of responses from Marc. Marc is king when it comes to Half-Life and I take his word over everything else. A few years back he replied to a fan email stating that:   ""...if we found someone clever enough to solve all the problems of writing such a thing (including the ones you list), we would probably just want them here working on the games as well!""  I think Marc has all of the core pieces of the story. He knows what will happen at the end. He knows who the Gman is and what he wants. There are answers to all of our questions. The problem lies in tying all of these ends together. The community isn't going to like having the story arc end with no answers. We have to have answers. Not only that, but with a story of this depth, we need a satisfying conclusion. The Gman is this mysterious figure - he has to become something we would have never thought of. Simply making him a human (for example) with a magic briefcase will disappoint fans and would be an injustice to the story. As a designer and writer I can tell that they have had serious development issues with story and direction.  Gabe backs this theory up.  """"In terms of Ricochet 2, we always have this problem that when we talk about things too far in advance, we end up changing our minds as we're going through and developing stuff, so as we're thinking through the giant story arc which is Ricochet 2, you might get to a point where you're saying something is surprising us in a positive way and something is surprising us in a negative way, and, you know, we'd like to be super-transparent about the future of Ricochet 2. The problem is, we think that the twists and turns that we're going through would probably drive people more crazy than just being silent about it, until we can be very crisp about what's happening next.""  They've been trying different things with the story arc - all of which are not working. They've come to a dead end. One minute we're going to Xen, the next we're not. Perhaps we're not going to the arctic anymore? - Whatever. The story is key here. The greatest aspect of our beloved game could also be it's downfall. They came to no obvious conclusion and had to move on with other projects. Most companies have long term plans (6 year plan etc) and I'm thinking they started to creep over trying to figure out a solution to the story arc - failed and stuck ""Revisit Half-Life 3"" at the end of their timetable.  Half-Life is Marc's creation, but it belongs to Valve.  Nothing can be done. Not without a ton of legal bullshit. We can never know what happens next without Half-Life 3.   I'll try to explain this as best I can. I work for a company and I write them software. The code is all mine - I wrote it. It was my concept, my idea - but the company owns it. When I walk away, I walk away without my software. It is not my software - it belongs to the business. The difference here is the software I write are small little .net applications where as Marc Laidlaw has written one of the most famous and influential stories of modern gaming.  And if he walks away from Valve, he could well walk away from that story too. Half-Life is a huge brand. It's a big thing. A big pile of money waiting to happen and however you may view Valve, as a business it is an incredibly valuable asset.  This is why all Valve employees are on total fucking lockdown on pain of death when it comes to Half-Life. Nobody who could possibly leak details of it's ending can know about it. A single leak could compromise the series and destroy it's value. Even if they haven't figured it out - the core elements are there.  And what of Marc? How does Marc feel? I will not speak for him as I do not know but I could speculate that he feels trapped. If I understand correctly, he still writes for Valve but Half-Life has to be his most cherished creation. I draw this speculation from the Breengrub transcript. It's almost as if he was dying to give us some information on the story and by claiming it being an ""experiment"", he was able to do so.  I fear Ted went through the same thing. Desperate to continue work on Half-Life but shoehorned (I've used this terminology before in another post) into a different project. It's so disheartening to see projects you love get scrapped - imagine watching Half-Life 3 go down the toilet.  Marc's a little different to Ted though. Marc is Half-Life. Even if he did leave, he wouldn't be able to tell anyone what happens next. He is as we are at the mercy of Gabe.  It's all about Hardware and Source 2 now.  I give Valve ~five more years until they go full producer mode.  They've got hardware pending. DOTA is becoming their flagship title. It's free to play. All profits will come from selling hardware and pushing out Steam games to those clients.  I can see the potential for one more Valve game. A VR or Steambox exclusive - perhaps Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3 or something to do with their 'RPG' project (found in DOTA 2's Source 2 files). And that will be used to help push the hardware. It will not be Half-Life 3. Valve have stated they experimented with Half-Life in VR and said they were unhappy with the experience and opted to make a Portal themed demo for their showcase instead. I can't see that point of view changing - so don't expect to see a Half-Life title for VR.  Next step? Push out Source 2 as an open source development platform. You don't see any more Unreal Tournament games - just the engine (I know that a very basic version of the game is shipped with the engine but this is used for demonstration purposes only). I believe Valve are to follow this path. Source 2 will become the next big engine that other companies will use to create games of the next generation, taking that responsibility out of Valve's hands. Valve will obtain funds from engine licensing, Steam and their hardware. Games design for them is phased out as they can survive without it. Half-Life 3 becomes vapourware around this point.  It's not in the code anymore.  Small one, albeit significant.  Previous excursions into Source/Source 2 code warranted various interesting things such as the 'weaponizer' or the 'ep3' references. These are gone. You could argue that the code has been trimmed down to increase performance for Dota 2 - but a lot of Half-Life 2/ep1/ep2 stuff exists in said code, leading me to believe that these ideas have been scrapped completely.  The majority of people at Valve are not interested in Half-Life 3.  Probably the saddest one but confirmed by Gabe himself very recently.  ""The only reason we'd go back and do like a super classic kind of product is if a whole bunch of people just internally at Valve said they wanted to do it and had a reasonable explanation for why [they did].""  Times change and people move on. The majority of Valve nowdays are probably invested in hardware, VR and - you guessed it - DOTA. Marc, Ted, Kelly - I'm guessing these were the guys who wanted Half-Life 3 (there are probably more). But the other artists don't. We know how Valve works. People work on what they want to work on. You could have four guys working on Half-Life 3 and the rest of the entire company championing DOTA 2. For as long as Valve remains Valve this will not change.   Interesting to note that Gabe says there they need a ""reasonable explanation"". Does this mean that if people want to move around at Valve, they have to get admittance from Gabe or other managers? Sounds like a likely scenario. Could it be that so many people at Valve would rather have DOTA 2, VR, Hardware or Source 2, that Half-Life 3 would be considered a waste of time and resources? That would put Gabe at the heart of it all again. Disallowing production on the series to continue in favour of Valve's other projects - judging the flow of those projects by employee interest. Let's face it - if the employee's are interested in what they are making, you're going to get a better product.  The community would be mad too - because they wouldn't understand the whole 'running a leading game company' thing. So Gabe would rather keep that fact to himself.  Where do we stand?  Nowhere, that's where. Valve - or Gabe - could show us some courtesy and tell us what the deal is straight. For some reason, he has decided against that and thus we are here, as we have been. For years. The owe us nothing - so they can be cruel.  Our hope is validated by two things. The obvious one being the fact that they may one day make Half-Life 3. In like, ten years or something. Seriously.  The second one is depressing but seems to be more likely at this point. Years will pass with no word of Half-Life 3. Marc may depart Valve. Then, in the distant future, the NDAs (Non-disclosure-agreements) surrounding Half-Life and it's episodes will expire for many previous members of staff. Depending on how they value Valve at that time -and only then- will the artists be able to talk about their experiences surrounding the fabled games development.  Hopefully Gabe will suck it up and tell us what the hell is going on. Until then, we're screwed."
HalfLife,3d7ky3,kingo86,6,Tue Jul 14 11:27:08 2015 UTC,"You make a lot of valid points.   It was depressing to read yet I'd like to stay optimistic that we'll hear something in the next couple of years. I like to think a billion dollar franchise and Valve would be able to navigate these issues given the motivation.   Valve not interested in hl3? Outsource to another company.   No code references? Well there are some but maybe like you say, they're good at leaving them out.   All about hardware? Again, outsource it.   Valves creation? Hasn't the Game of Thrones show outpaced the original writer?   They don't know how to finish the story? That was a few years ago that Marc left that comment has he got a better idea of where to take it now?  What do you think @Empty_Allocution?"
HalfLife,3d7ky3,Empty_Allocution,8,Tue Jul 14 12:56:38 2015 UTC,I totally agree that they could outsource it. I'm not sure why they wouldn't though.  I don't get it really. Why wouldn't you make Half-Life 3?
HalfLife,3d7ky3,kingo86,8,Tue Jul 14 13:00:04 2015 UTC,"Probably stems back to your first point about the story not finished.   If they finished the hl2 story arc gracefully with episode 3,it might have been easier for them to make way for hl3. Let's face it, it's going to be awkward for people coming into the game after Eli was just killed. It's going to be awkward even if they choose to ignore it.  Whatever they do, I hope they release it before I die in another 50 plus years."
HalfLife,3d7ky3,Empty_Allocution,2,Tue Jul 14 14:06:53 2015 UTC,Same here. I keep thinking that. People have died waiting for this game. I don't want to be one of those people.
HalfLife,3d7ky3,Goofybud16,7,Tue Jul 14 16:36:51 2015 UTC,"Not in the code anymore   I feel that there are possibly multiple explanations for this. One is that, yes, they are not working on it and it has been scrapped and killed.  The other is that they are simply tighter on leaking stuff. Look at http://combineoverwiki.net/wiki/Future_of_the_Half-Life_series . Look at 2011, a ton of stuff happens. Then look at 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. 2011 is huge and full of leaks, information, and other stuff. 2012-2015, the amount of stuff has dropped drastically. I think there is a reason for this. They have been developing HL3, and ARE working on it. They are facing unknown challenges. They don't know when it will be released. After 2011, and the insane amount of leaks, Gabe/someone started cracking down on everything released to try and prevent anything related to HL3 getting released. While they are working on it, they have begun attempting to cut down on anything HL getting leaked. Possibly the reason we see less references to it in game files is that it no longer is the main title for Source 2 Development, Dota 2 is. The Dota 2 team is working with the Source 2 team to develop the engine more than the Half Life 3 team, who still does work with them, but they have either: gotten to the point Source 2 does everything they need and are working on the game independently, or are working on a seperate and private branch of Source 2 to implement some features they need but Dota 2 doesn't. (Look at the Portal 2 engine, it removes a lot of things and adds a lot of things to make the game possible, it isn't just the stock 2011/2012 engine.) Half Life 3 is being worked on, they are just doing their best to be silent about it. Once they have developed the game, it will be released.  TL;DR: Valve fucked up in 2011, cracked down on leaks. HL3 is being developed, but it is not on the same version of Source 2 as Dota 2, it has it's own version like Portal 2. Source 2 is mature enough that everyone doesn't use 1 version of the engine, everyone can ""fork"" it to make their own version for their game like Portal 2 did. We don't see references to HL3 because that version is private and only inside Valve at this time."
HalfLife,3d7ky3,Empty_Allocution,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:05:46 2015 UTC,"This could totally be the case. Absolutely. I have a theory regarding this... theory, that I neglected to share yesterday as it went against my original point.  Years ago a French Magazine reported that someone had leaked details of Half-Life 3 saying it had taken the direction of an RPG. Link  What I did manage to find in code a few weeks back was a default game list for the new Hammer, one of which was called 'RPG'. This stumped me at first until days later I re-read that article. I couldn't find anything else related to it in those files. They could have hidden it all.  So yeah, I totally agree with you. It would go with my other point about Half-Life 3 being so valuable. Can't afford to have details get out, even in the code. Lets hope that this is the case."
HalfLife,3d7ky3,Carbon140,2,Wed Jul 15 06:29:56 2015 UTC,"Just to counter and give people unjustified hope I’ll reply with my thoughts on some of that.   They don't know how to finish the story.  “I think Marc has all of the core pieces of the story. He knows what will happen at the end. He knows who the Gman is and what he wants. There are answers to all of our questions. The problem lies in tying all of these ends together.” """"In terms of Ricochet 2, we always have this problem that when we talk about things too far in advance, we end up changing our minds as we're going through and developing stuff, so as we're thinking through the giant story arc which is Ricochet 2, you might get to a point where you're saying something is surprising us in a positive way and something is surprising us in a negative way, and, you know, we'd like to be super-transparent about the future of Ricochet 2. The problem is, we think that the twists and turns that we're going through would probably drive people more crazy than just being silent about it, until we can be very crisp about what's happening next.""   That statement is more a statement about how much they chop and change stuff, hell it even says right there “twists and turns we’re going through”, implying it is being worked on. Having delved into the HL2 beta, it’s obvious Valve aren’t afraid to scrap huge amounts of work, and they also build off old ideas a lot (Hl2 plus episodes is loosely following the old HL2 beta locales and story). Honestly people probably would get frustrated, they certainly would have if they had been privy to the original plans for HL2, and then seen the final result.   Half-Life is Marc's creation, but it belongs to Valve.  “This is why all Valve employees are on total fucking lockdown on pain of death when it comes to Half-Life. Nobody who could possibly leak details of it's ending can know about it. A single leak could compromise the series and destroy it's value. Even if they haven't figured it out - the core elements are there.”   They were able to keep HL2 almost completely secret, I am sure they are capable of doing this again.   It's all about Hardware and Source 2 now.  I give Valve ~five more years until they go full producer mode. I can see the potential for one more Valve game. A VR or Steambox exclusive - perhaps Left 4 Dead 3, Portal 3 or something to do with their 'RPG' project (found in DOTA 2's Source 2 files). And that will be used to help push the hardware. It will not be Half-Life 3. Valve have stated they experimented with Half-Life in VR and said they were unhappy with the experience and opted to make a Portal themed demo for their showcase instead. I can't see that point of view changing - so don't expect to see a Half-Life title for VR. While I agree with the statement about their direction, your statement about “don’t expect to see Half-life in VR” is a very bold statement to make from Valve simply saying the portal VR demo worked better. I have no doubt that portal worked as a better stage for the Vive demo, I am not sure what they would have used in a Half-Life scene, but an exploded, visually clean robot to play with seems like a fantastic demo compared to….maybe piecing together scrap in a junkyard to reassemble “dog”?   I will make a few of points here, Half-Life has always been about “you” being Gordon freeman, arguably VR is the next step in immersion and also Half-life2 was the game that single-handedly put steam and Valve in the position they are in today. From leaks they are obviously working on Left 4 Dead 3 in source 2, they obviously have some of portal in source 2, and they seemingly have scraps of HL3 in source 2. From my knowledge of source 2, they are making it highly optimized, and even the dota 2 characters are now real world metric units in height, this is ideal for VR, running high resolution at high framerates. They are also seemingly wanting to push VR and their hardware, and nothing is going to push those things like some amazing games. If they are serious about this, I am sure they are WELL aware that an announcement for “orange box 2” with Half-Life3, portal 3 and lef4dead3 would have their hardware sold to millions of customers in a matter of hours. I am sure some marketing genius could come up with some catchy marketing for 3 titles with 3 in them too.   It's not in the code anymore.  Small one, albeit significant. Previous excursions into Source/Source 2 code warranted various interesting things such as the 'weaponizer' or the 'ep3' references. These are gone. You could argue that the code has been trimmed down to increase performance for Dota 2 - but a lot of Half-Life 2/ep1/ep2 stuff exists in said code, leading me to believe that these ideas have been scrapped completely.   They seem to be actively attempting to take out and hide references to HL3 as soon as they are discovered when they probably don’t need to, it says the opposite to me, they are still actively hiding what they are working on.   The majority of people at Valve are not interested in Half-Life 3.  Probably the saddest one but confirmed by Gabe himself very recently. ""The only reason we'd go back and do like a super classic kind of product is if a whole bunch of people just internally at Valve said they wanted to do it and had a reasonable explanation for why [they did]."" Times change and people move on. The majority of Valve nowdays are probably invested in hardware, VR and - you guessed it - DOTA. Marc, Ted, Kelly - I'm guessing these were the guys    Funnily enough, this I find to me the most compelling argument for never seeing HL3."

HalfLife,3d70s6,_Z3D_,3,Tue Jul 14 13:01:19 2015 UTC,I'm going to start off by saying I am a STRONG believer that HL3 is in development but to answer this question I believe it will never even be spoken to the public from valve. They would shroud this series into mystery and leave us to wait to get it. Imagine how many people would watch a conference from Valve announcing a new game and every one getting hyped to see HL3 and it's a different game. That is publicity barely any other gaming company's get.  TL;DR: if there's never a Half life 3 we will never hear about a Half life 3

I understand why no team wants to work on HL3, because they themselves could be doubting their ability to live up to the expectations that we have come to, well... Expect. However, there are so many different reasons about why they SHOULD make HL3 that completely overruns the number of reasons they shouldn't.  TL;DR: HL3 confirmed."

A lot of cut content ended up still existing in the universe, but out of view (like the Cremators or Bullsquids in the canals), so the same could apply to this device. My theory is that the Combine use momma pods to birth the headcrabs that they then load into headcrab shells and fire at rebel bases."

He can put you in a fight that you have no chance of winning, ie., he puts you in the middle of a battlefield full of these things and the credits roll, meaning you died. :(   Presumably, in the lore, Gordon obviously chose option one, but either option will make the credits roll.

Eli has nothing to offer comparing to the Combine or Nihillant himself. I like the part explaining how G-Man is getting around though."
HalfLife,3d3010,YakusActual,3,Mon Jul 13 11:43:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed, what would Eli offer G-man for the combine?"
HalfLife,3d3010,0bi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:30:10 2015 UTC,"Eli has the support of the Vortigaunts, but he, and the G-man just don't know it. He only wants to enter this contract to save Alyx and fend off the oncoming Combine invasion that G-man probably warned him about. Eli had no idea about the slavery part. G-Man is an amoral 4-dimensional bureaucrat; he just wants to sell his products regardless of the customer's status as good or evil. It's pretty much canon that Eli had a deal with the G-man (See Episode 2)."
HalfLife,3d3010,YakusActual,2,Mon Jul 13 14:33:30 2015 UTC,"No, Eli was forced to obey G-Man's will. Listen to what Eli says about that day in BM. Also G-Man says he had his OWN reasons to save Alyx. Vortiguants have their own beef with G-Man because he wants to control Gordon. It all is not connected around the slavery."

EDIT: to clarify, i mean crossover as in be the same game. as in portal 3 = half life 3, it would just be one combined game. of course they will crossover in a story sense as they already have, but the two series will probably not converge into a single game like what some people thought before portal 2. since portal 2 though that seems highly unlikely as that kind of finished portal up."
HalfLife,3d0pwa,VTJP,22,Sun Jul 12 17:44:20 2015 UTC,"How is it not a credible theory, there is the borealis ship mentioned in Ep2 and in portal 2 you literally go to the Borealisis dock."

HalfLife,3d0pwa,VTJP,-13,Sun Jul 12 19:46:53 2015 UTC,I mean portal had a silent character like Gordon of course you wouldn't have the 2 of them in the same fucking game an idiot could have guessed that.

HalfLife,3d0pwa,VTJP,-10,Sun Jul 12 21:23:51 2015 UTC,no one that isnt retarded was asssuming chell and gordon were gonna be in the same game. The only assumptions were that they were gonna intersect game universes.

If you wanna say they were retarded go ahead (although thats a bit rude dont you think?) , but there were tons of them.   i personally never thought it was a good idea as the gameplay styles dont mesh, but lots of people did think that might be the case."

HalfLife,3d0pwa,Riomaki,10,Wed Jul 15 08:04:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think an announcement and a short trailer like this had would beat out Bethesda's conference this year.  Yes it's half-life 3, but that conference, specifically all the Fallout 4 stuff, blew everyone out of the water."
HalfLife,3d0pwa,Jataka,15,Sun Jul 12 19:15:39 2015 UTC,"I'd agree.  Half-Life 3's announcement wouldn't have trumped Fallout 4's.  At best, the two would be equal, unless HL3 was released the day of the announcement.  The thing about Fallout 4, and 3 and New Vegas for that matter, is that they do not lack for content.  Todd Howard talked about and demonstrated the game for 30 minutes.  This is what you asked for, we're delivering it and we're going to spend the next half-hour showing you why you should buy it.  More devs could learn from that approach.  No silly trailers-for-trailers.  No 10 second glimpses.  No screwing around and teasing the players with silly ARGs and viral marketing.  This was the put up or shut up approach - the kind of bold statement that needs to make everyone else elevate their game."
HalfLife,3d0pwa,firetim1,5,Sun Jul 12 19:42:47 2015 UTC,"Fallout 4 really isn't that impressive in my book. It's still got the same antiquated movement of its predecessors, the same primitive use of shaders, and a whole fortress-building mechanic that looks like a well-done mod mixed with Ubisoft's shitty open world player engagement rulebook.  The only thing impressive about FO4 is the character creation, improvements to combat, and the pre-apocalypse assets.  It wasn't even a surprise. Everyone knew there was a Fallout 4 years ago. And it hasn't even been long since the last Bethesda game.   When it came to actually tossing out reveals this year, and perhaps this decade, Sony's conference takes the cake. And I'd admit that year in and year out Sony's conferences have been pretty shit."

It's still got the same antiquated movement of its predecessors, the same primitive use of shaders, and a whole fortress-building mechanic that looks like a well-done mod mixed with Ubisoft's shitty open world player engagement rulebook.   Couple it's pre-existing weaknesses with a not-quite-next-gen game and you really aren't ""blowing everyone else out of the water."" Honestly, I wish HL3 was announced this year just because what little we have seen of Source 2 already looks like its 2-3 years ahead of Fallout 4."

I understand not being able to follow the ARG every day, or even every week, but with E3 being about 2.5 months after the game's official announcement you can't call it a surprise, and you definitely can't call out others for being internet dwellers just because you didn't notice a month long barrage of information about the game."

And then if you saw my third comment below this one, the G-Man can prevent you from escaping and put you in stasis at the end of the EP3 Src2 Tech Demo. At the beginning of HL3, it has been three months and during that time, the rebels and Combine are fighting a very bloodly battle on the Borealis, and the G-Man places you in a Combine-controlled area of the ship. The Combine captures you as you do not have any weapons, and eventually, you meet Alyx and Barney while you were in custody."

Afterwards, it fades in with you riding inside a Helicopter with Alex. Looking out the window, you see snowy mountains and ice caps as you realize that you are in the arctic, with Alex in a heavy coat.  She looks over at you, a very depressed look on her face from the recent (SPOILER) death of her father (SPOILER). She asks if you are okay, seeing as you just zoned out. After a few more recaps of what happened by Alex, the pilot gives an alert that they have been spotted by Combine Overwatch.  Alex screams ""Oh shit!"" as the multiple pelts are heard from Combine firing at the helicopter. Before you know it, a whole part of the bottom of the helicopter is blown off, revealing a very high drop as the plane starts to sway, still in flight. The plane begins to rock and rumble from bullet after bullet hits it. It gets extremely heavy before Alex screams ""Oh god, hold o-"", but before she finishes it, the tail is blown off by a missile.  The plane begins to spin out of control before slamming into the ground, the screen going black. When you wake up, you find Alyx is gone, and judging by the foot prints in the snow, they lead into the cave, and the pilot dead, having died by a gunshot wound while spinning out and the initial crash. You see that you have landed in a ravine between the ice, a cave being seen at the back that leads to god knows what.  As you make your way over, you find a massive drop between you and the cave, unable to be jumped. However, a boulder is seen that you are able to push to make a bridge. She talks before helping you push it, covering the gap and letting you pass on into the cave, which serves as a tutorial and first combat as you fight some Combine scouts."

HalfLife,3d1y4o,OfficialDaBlaze,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:56:04 2015 UTC,"[MAJOR SPOILER] I feel like they would start where Half Life 2 Ep 2 left off. Then maybe the vorts would try to bring Eli back to life as they did with Alyx, but then find that there is a unknown force (the gman) interfering. Resulting in Eli being permanently dead. :("
HalfLife,3d1y4o,Trelifaxx164,3,Sun Jul 12 22:30:30 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS!!!!  !!!!  !!!!  I think Eli is permanently dead. The Advisor cracked into his skull and stole either parts of or his whole brain, or stole the information within it: we don't know.  The Combine could very well be on their way or already have the place surrounded. The G-man could not interfere with Gordon whenever Vorts were around to keep him at bay, and there was at least one inside (Uriah, the one in the labcoat). So I don't expect another telepathic intro, being frozen in time.  I think Half-Life 3 will throw the player directly back into the action, likely an ambush by the Combine with little support from any Resistance members who may be patrolling White Forest. You'll be forced to leave in the helicopter I doubt Eli's body would be left behind, as a lot of character development and story could come out during Vance's funeral (likely at Mossman's holdout, post-Combine attack) from any number of characters.  First game mechanics introduced would be a Gauss gun/Tau Canon/Combine Rifle attached to the heli, fighting off footsoldiers and attack choppers. Maybe a strider or 10 and some Hunters - a full armada that pinpointed your location for a final showdown.   White Forest is obliterated. Kleiner is taken hostage. Magnusson is MIA, creating an air of mystery about not only his lively status but his allegiance if he is seen alive and well. My justification for that is there needs to be another 'Judith' of HL2 to be seen as a distraction to not only the audience but the Rebels as well, or even a free agent within the Resistance to build drama.  Reunite with Judith at her previously undisclosed location. Seek refuge and reunite with D0g who was transported with the survivors of the attack on White Forest - effectively giving you a unit to order around (more tutorials)  Fight Combine in the tundras (after being ambushed by Elites - they're white!!) on your way to the ruins of the Borealis. You took some hits in combat and only had access to health packs, so you're about to experience the brutality of the cold. Rush to your next location as the suit's energy depletes.  Reach a safe haven with more resistance members who stave off Combine while a rebel leader tells you all something monumental that has just been discovered on or about The Borealis.  [HALF-LIFE 3]"

I didn't expect the train at the start of HL3 to be in city 17 ... or even necicarily on Earth.

Perhaps they should have Episode 3 just be like a Source 2 Tech Demo, where the staff of White Forest are having a funeral for Eli when the Combine launch a massive attack. The player will have to remember the controls and fight them off, and in the end, the G-Man intervenes before you could escape and your fate remains unknown."

HalfLife,3cyxxk,Danisnotonavan,6,Sun Jul 12 04:20:13 2015 UTC,"From a Watsonian perspective, I think it's kind of up in the air whether the vortigaunt himself was being sarcastic. It seems like the vortigaunts genuinely revere him. In the case of that specific vortigaunt, I'm willing to bet that he does think Freeman is amazing, but was overdoing it to make fun of him. Which in a sense I think is kind of adorable, as it creates a sense of camaraderie  From a Doylist perspective, Valve is totally mocking all the praise Freeman gets. XD"
HalfLife,3cyxxk,NorikoMorishima,4,Mon Jul 13 03:34:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I love about the vortigaunts. They all deeply respect Freeman (and you feel like it's because they know more about him than you do yourself), but they're also really cheeky. Makes for some fun dialogue."
HalfLife,3cyxxk,Danisnotonavan,4,Mon Jul 13 03:43:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they can be pretty cheeky! I love the two vortigaunts who apologize for speaking vortigese in front of Gordon, tell him they'll speak English in front of him unless they want to insult him…and then immediately start speaking in vortigese again. Smart-asses! XD  My guess is they weren't actually insulting him in vortigese but just said what they did to make fun of him. :P  The other thing I love about them is that they don't seem to expect anything in return for what they do for the Resistance. I realized this after noticing a couple things about the relationship between humans and vortigaunts that initially bothered me:  1) The vortigaunts are rarely treated or referred to as individuals, but are usually referred to as ""the vortigaunts"" or ""a vortigaunt"", and seem to be seen as more or less interchangeable with each other. When Alyx shows up in Black Mesa East, she says ""The vortigaunts relieved me so I could come see Gordon."" If she were talking about humans, she'd probably use their names, or at least say ""a few people"", not just ""the people"" or ""the humans"". And only one vortigaunt even has a canon name. Often a specific vortigaunt is referred to as ""my vortigaunt friend"" or something similar. If he's your friend, why don't you know or use his name? At Black Mesa East, no one bothers to introduce Gordon to the vortigaunt that Eli was talking to, or even acknowledge his presence. What's going on here? Are vortigaunts not important?  2) Most of what you see vortigaunts doing at bases is menial labour: Cooking, powering generators, sweeping, and so on. The enslaved vortigaunt you see when you arrive in City 17 is sweeping, too. If the Resistance makes them do the same kind of work, how are they much better? Obviously the Resistance vortigaunts are at least there by choice, and helping someone they actually want to help, but jeez, that's kind of degrading work! And as we've seen, they're quite intelligent — arguably more so than humans — and capable of a lot more than you usually see them do at the bases. Yet none of the vortigaunts seem to be on the science team in any greater capacity than using their voodoo powers on strange components.  This used to bug me, because it felt like even the Resistance folks didn't truly respect the vortigaunts, were treating them like second-class citizens or servants instead of people with distinct personalities, and basically using them and not really appreciating everything they do. But then I thought about what the Victory Mine Vortigaunt said when Alyx tried to thank him for his help: ""Our bonds are of nature, and require no gratitude.""  It occurred to me that the vortigaunts probably differ from us psychologically in ways not made explicitly clear. For instance, maybe vortigaunts actually disdain the idea of being thanked for something they see as their preordained duty. Or maybe they don't find it necessary to express or receive gratitude in words if it is made clear in other ways, or if they know they're making a difference. (When have you ever heard a vortigaunt thank someone else for something? And yet you never get the impression that they are ungrateful.) Maybe most Resistance members aren't lavish with their gratitude because they know this.  And maybe vortigaunts see no important difference between menial tasks and more prestigious work, as long as it's making a difference to somebody; and they are therefore assigned to what we consider drudgery precisely because it makes no difference to them.  And considering that vortigaunts seem to be able to communicate telepathically, maybe they're a semi-hive-mind — maybe they don't have terribly distinct personalities. Maybe they don't mind not being treated more like individuals. Hell, maybe a lot of them don't actually have names because they don't find them necessary. And for all we know, maybe vortigaunts don't like being introduced to people! Maybe they prefer to approach the person themselves, or wait for the person to approach them. Maybe everything we see that looks like a lack of respect from a human perspective, is actually done out of respect for the vortigaunts' differing priorities.  Once I started turning this over in my head, I started seeing the vortigaunts' relationship with the Resistance in a much more positive light. This interpretation is my headcanon. :P"

HalfLife,3cy28y,CommanderCooper,24,Sat Jul 11 20:30:45 2015 UTC,"They most likely only had one suit left. All the dead HEV researchers on Xen can attest that you still need to have a mind for combat to put the HEV to good use. Anyone else besides Gordon would have gotten themselves killed or captured, and then the HEV suit is lost. It had to be saved to help Gordon be invincible whenever he returns."

HalfLife,3cy28y,2-4601,5,Sat Jul 11 22:46:03 2015 UTC,"I think Kleiner and Eli knew that Gordon was going to return. Eli had communication with the G-Man before, I'm guessing Kleiner did as well.  They probably saved the suit, per the G-Man's instructions, for Gordon."
HalfLife,3cy28y,HalfLife1MasterRace,5,Sat Jul 11 23:03:56 2015 UTC,"Do we know that it's Gordon's suit, and not just another Mark IV? I'm sure Kleiner had access to more and/or knew how to repair them with assistance from the manual.    I suspect Kleiner had an inlking that Gordon would eventually return. Perhaps he had gone into witness protection or went off the grid to live in fear and would one day find out about Black Mesa East and contact Isaac, Judith, or Eli. The fact that he was reunited with Barney would seem to be pure chance from an outsider's perspective, but we know a bit more.  I'm sure if it was in storage it was used for menial tasks in slightly irradiated zones which held resources, like how Alyx used the Gravity Gun for heavy lifting around the yard. At least, that's my headcanon.."
HalfLife,3cy28y,Lightningstar95,2,Sun Jul 12 02:00:53 2015 UTC,"Knowing the G-Man, he would have ensured that it fell into Kleiner's hands just before Gordon arrived, but with just enough time to upgrade it. Likely they were figuring out who to give it to when Barney's call came in. I'd guess he planted it in a Combine base that was about to be raided, out just outright mind-controlled them like with Cubbage."

HalfLife,3cy28y,Lightningstar95,2,Sun Jul 12 20:39:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry, personal theory. Remember in Ep. 2 how he ""suggested"" to Alyx to carry a message for him while she slept, and later that got triggered by his image popping up? Same deal with Cubbage, he strongly suggested that he give Freeman the RPG and told him an attack was coming (the resistance was unusually well informed of that) then covered himself by making them forget he was there. Awkward questions, and all...."
HalfLife,3cy28y,jankan001,5,Sun Jul 12 20:49:03 2015 UTC,"To everyone claiming that only Freeman could use the HEV suit and that they were saving it for him, you have to realize NOBODY ELSE knew if Freeman was even alive. The last anyone saw of him he was off into the portal, and they just assumed he killed the Nihilanth because Xen aliens stopped coming. He could have easily been trapped there to starve to death, or been killed by another hazard after killing the Nihilanth. And beyond that, the last dozens of people to see Gordon were likely killed in the explosion along with the other large majority of the base's population. The whole One-And-Only-Freeman shit they pulled off in Half-Life 2 doesn't make sense."

She escaped in one piece, presumably some place free of combine rule, probably afterwards since the game supposedly takes place of a millennium after Portal 1.  Portal has always been a very isolated and personal experience, so I think the ending made sense in that regard.  Also, any more details would mess with Half-Life's story."
HalfLife,3cxf9h,bothanspy1337,3,Sun Jul 12 08:36:26 2015 UTC,Chell's story is over and finished.  But Doug Rattman is still very well alive and out there.

Whatever mechanic that game used, Valve and the playtesters went absolutely bananas over it.  It was only shelved because playtesters wanted more portals.  They can bring the same humor, characters, and backstory, without having to drag back in Chell or the Portals.  Not that I hate portals, but Portal 2 wrapped up the story arc so nicely that I feel like a sequel or some sort of continuation isn't necessary at this point.    I really need to see what F-Stop is!"

HalfLife,3culgv,Nytra,6,Sat Jul 11 01:21:02 2015 UTC,Played through it recently and had the same impression. It was quite a challenge.
HalfLife,3culgv,__i_dont_know,2,Fri Jul 10 22:22:53 2015 UTC,"The team said they modeled the damage after HL2 combine soldiers but playing the games back to back, BMS still seems as if it has overpowered the HECU units."
HalfLife,3culgv,mechanical_animal,2,Sat Jul 11 03:16:08 2015 UTC,"I could see how their damage output could be similar... but there are so many other factors involved here.  Their accuracy, the relative ineffectiveness of player weapons, their movement speed, etc.  Fans know that the HECU AI had some limitations.  For example, they couldn't run and shoot at the same time.  Often, you'd land some pot shots on them while they ran away from you and pivoted around to face you.  When they did fire, the HECU hit hard, so they were always a threat you didn't take lightly.  And they also moved pretty fast.  The Combine Soldier AI lets them run and fire at the same time.  Of course, that made them particularly relentless since they could be attacking all the time.  So, Valve slowed them down and made them waste time with flavor animations and such.  It makes the Combine generally easier to fight, but given the chance, they can be clever enemies.  The Black Mesa HECU is basically the worst of both worlds.  They combined the HECU's damage and run speed with the Combine Soldier's run-and-gun ability to create a very difficult, uncompromising AI.  As a player, to reload is to die.  Your weapons are pretty ineffective against them and they move so quickly that you'll get flushed out of cover really fast.  But you have to take cover or else their blazingly accurate hitscan guns will perforate you in seconds.  More often than not, the player is left between a rock and a hard place."

You can dodge them just fine, but if they land anywhere near you, you'll take damage anyway.  The Helicopter actually isn't that bad - but the arena where you fight it is.  Put simply, the cover doesn't work.  The collision is messed up, or the terrain under it ramps up too much.  Either way, you're not in cover when you think you're supposed to be.  And it doesn't help that probably about 30% of the time, rockets will ricochet off the chopper instead of damaging it.  I haven't heard about that bug getting fixed yet."

HalfLife,3croe0,Riomaki,13,Fri Jul 10 10:35:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah. People seem to think that GabeN is the mastermind. While he certainly is the leader of Valve and Steam and is responsible for making Valve as big as it is, he doesn't actually have that much creative input on games. It really surprises me when people think Gabe is actually making the games."
HalfLife,3croe0,bothanspy1337,4,Fri Jul 10 11:40:03 2015 UTC,He might not have much creative input on the games themselves but he does have heavy pull  on the direction the company goes (he's the CEO afterall). He is very much the mastermind behind it all.
HalfLife,3croe0,CP_Officer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:05:33 2015 UTC,That's what I said. He is the leader of the company but not games

The video game media likes to make celebrities out of a handful of individual developers, but in reality, other people do the lion's share of the work.  That's why whenever you see a Kickstarter from one of these celebrities (Tim Schafer, Keiji Inafune, etc), you shouldn't assume that past successes were solely because of their involvement."

HalfLife,3cr5bv,Trelifaxx164,3,Fri Jul 10 17:00:08 2015 UTC,"I've considered that for a while, but I think it's just having way too much faith in a company to release not only the ""perfect"" product (13 years with no new installment would be a very long hiatus), but to align it with the lore like that?

HalfLife,3cr5si,Riomaki,7,Fri Jul 10 02:51:48 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say ""most.""  Not by a longshot.  Most of the top single player mods on Run Think Shoot Live are as simple as putting them in the Sourcemods folder.  There's even been a fellow making the rounds on various entries, posting on whether or not they are Linux compatible.  Very few such mods have custom installers - Riot Act is the only one that comes to mind.  That said, the more a mod overwrites core systems, the more likely it won't work on Linux.  Of course, equally said, Wine does a heck of a job running Windows games via Windows Steam now..."
HalfLife,3cr5si,RyanHarms00,3,Fri Jul 10 03:20:49 2015 UTC,I believe as long as the mod doesn't contain any .dll files it should work on Linux. But I second the wine recommendation as well.
HalfLife,3cr5si,Riomaki,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:27:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, several months ago I was toying around in Linux Mint.  I managed to get Wine set up with Windows Steam and Half-Life 2 to the point where I could run Hammer and compile levels.  And play Borderlands.  With voice chat.  In multiplayer.  If I had to run a Linux desktop, Mint proved to be a perfectly viable solution.  Dare I say - I think Wine ran Half-Life 2 better than Valve's Linux-native Half-Life 2.  At least when it would do weird things, the community had fixes for it.  With Valve, it's all a mystery when stuff doesn't work."

HalfLife,3ctfpw,Diehard50,7,Sat Jul 11 02:16:46 2015 UTC,That's because it is Valves page. For some reason ModDB allows you to add engines/games to any companies page as long as they don't change a certain setting.

Fuck just let marc write it in book form, why the hell not?  EDIT: spelling"
HalfLife,3cnhva,whats_not_in_a_name,7,Thu Jul 9 08:13:03 2015 UTC,I think having some sort of Marc Laidlaw book about the history of Black Mesa would be really awesome. Sort of like the Bioshock: Rapture novel but in more of a non-fiction sort of writing style. Just the concept of a massive underground research base - completely self sustainable non-the-less - gets my brain pumping out theories left and right.
HalfLife,3cnhva,HalfLife1MasterRace,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:08:15 2015 UTC,Gabe basically said he can't cancel it. He vaguely and indirectly stated they're saving non-microtransaction games for if their main scheme fails. Which it won't.  Half-Life 3 is literally for emergencies only.
HalfLife,3cnhva,Ultimate_Cabooser,2,Sat Jul 11 04:37:37 2015 UTC,when did he say that? do you have a source? because i have never heard this.

HalfLife,3cnhva,lionheartcz,4,Thu Jul 9 13:38:03 2015 UTC,"I've said it before and I'll say it again - missing the 10th anniversary was the point where I simply gave up and had the same reaction as the guy in the video.  Valve doesn't deserve the creative, devoted fanbase it has.  It has shown them nothing but disrespect over the years.  I've never seen a professional developer act with such disdain toward its fans, especially the fans that made them a household name in the first place."
HalfLife,3cnhva,Riomaki,2,Thu Jul 9 21:27:53 2015 UTC,Agreed a hundred percent. It's just disrespectful and pretty unwarranted from the amount of love their fans give them.
HalfLife,3cnhva,lionheartcz,-3,Thu Jul 9 22:57:22 2015 UTC,"What does acknowledging it have to do with anything? The 10th anniversary would've been a special time to do it, who cares? Saying it's disrespectful is bullshit, they didn't announce it either yet or because they aren't making it."
HalfLife,3cnhva,kwertyuiop,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:10:16 2015 UTC,"It's disrespectful because they know what the fans want, but they don't have the decency to tell them one way or another.  Instead, they just tease them.  They basically take their fans for granted.  Plus, Steampipe broke a lot of stuff.  Hundreds of user-made mods broke.  Fans spent countless hours on projects like these, and this was the thanks they got.  The save stutter is back.  Objects vanish.  The bugs we've logged on Github go on for miles.  And then Valve just started ignoring all the problems that Steampipe created.  Maybe they got bored of Steampipe and moved on to something else.  Either way, they left the job as unfinished as their episodic trilogy.  So, yeah, it's inaccurate to say that the 10th Anniversary itself was the thing.  It was more like the straw that broke the camel's back."
HalfLife,3cnhva,Riomaki,9,Sat Jul 11 16:23:08 2015 UTC,"Then it gets announced in a few months and we're gonna be like ""Sorry Gabe we didn't mean to be rude, HL3 is awesomeeee!"".  But it's true that companies love a regular influx of small money rather than a single dose of big money when a big game like HL3 is sold. This is just how the world is: workers want a regular salary and this translates to companies wanting regular income. That's why phone companies want you to sign a contract, that's why you buy your car and house on a loan, why Photoshop can only be use with a subscription, etc... The modern world loves small regular payments and hates big, non-regular payments.  That doesn't mean HL3 is dead, it just means we need to be much more tolerant that those who happen to love things that collect small regular payments. So our stuff is going to be unpredictable just like our payments. It's going to be non-regular, but it's going to be big, always."

But in the end, these micro-transactions leave me feeling empty, depressed, and angry at times. I only hope that they leave the micro-transactions to these two IPs and leave their future titles alone, assuming they every finish them. But after all this has been said, I can be bitter, but I also have many other things in life I look forward to, so I can wait for their next game. I have no choice either way."

It's just a matter of understanding the source material and seeing what the artist was trying to accomplish.  Look at the new Star Wars movie.  Most would argue it's doing a pretty damn good job of staying faithful to the source material.  Honestly, I don't think HL3 will ever ""live up to the hype"", but not for the reasons people think.  HL2 came out at the right time and place.  Half-Life was still a new series, and computers were making some serious leaps in graphics technology in the six-year absence between the two games.  The most I'm hoping for is a solid game with a good art style and story in its own right, differing enough from HL2 that it feels fresh.  Whether or not it's ""better"" than HL2 is going to come down to straight gameplay and storytelling.  So basically, pure preference."
HalfLife,3clz8r,bothanspy1337,5,Thu Jul 9 00:16:20 2015 UTC,"Look at the new Star Wars movie. Most would argue it's doing a pretty damn good job of staying faithful to the source material.   This is kind of a bad example, because virtually all of those designs are directly lifted from or overtly inspired by the concept art of Ralph McQuarrie. He basically single-handedly created the 'vibe' of Star Wars, and I do think that the best designs are those that take heavily from his work. People can imitate his style to some extent, but I still feel like his design vocabulary is harmonious in a way that's hard to replicate. Sometimes a single artist is such a creative powerhouse that they really can have a huge impact on a project.  EDIT: Here's Part 1 of an excellent documentary in which they discuss how important Ralph was to Star Wars: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlcjTqxzWEk"
HalfLife,3clz8r,huxtiblejones,2,Thu Jul 9 05:48:21 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more in line with the Stormtroopers and the new variants, but I totally see where you're coming from.  I'm pretty sure you can't copy someone's style to a ""T"", but I do believe that a trained artist can learn to analyze other artists' work and draw from them to create a ""blend"" of sorts.  For example, all of the prequel stuff was completely fresh without McQuarrie's involvement, but I have to say it did a pretty damn good job of moving into the famous ""wedge"" shape and transitioning the clones into Stormtroopers."
HalfLife,3clz8r,bothanspy1337,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:21:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, artists can take cues from other artists for sure. But if you watch that doc I posted, they talk specifically about the prequel designs and how basically every single one was inspired by or lifted from Ralph's sketches and paintings. Even after his death, his work was the gold standard and was the basis of all the prequel visuals. It's actually amazing how creative Ralph was, I guarantee you that the new movie is heavily referencing his work."
HalfLife,3clz8r,huxtiblejones,2,Thu Jul 9 19:35:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed. HL2 is very different from HL1, but you can definitely see the connections. I'm sure before HL2 came out HL fans were not expecting a 20 year leap and this alien force called the Combine. My point is HL3 will probably differ from most of our expectations but in a good way."
HalfLife,3clz8r,babyavery22,14,Sun Jul 12 04:32:12 2015 UTC,Kelly Bailey left and came back. Could just be that all the concept art is done for half life 3 and he wants a break until the next major chapter of the half life universe needs art.
HalfLife,3clz8r,Japface,9,Wed Jul 8 23:50:45 2015 UTC,"I want to believe that theory the most, because this means Half-Life 3 is under development and reached a certain stage where concepts are accepted."

I understand he was very important to designing the world of Half-Life, but he's been working at Valve for nearly 20 years.  Maybe it was just time for a career change?  Lots of other people have left over the years.  In fact, I think the entirety of the original Steam team has left, as well as most of the DigiPen students who worked on Portal.  It's very normal for people to leave their job.  If Valve wants to make Half-Life 3, they're going to do it whether he's there or not.  Nothing has changed.

HalfLife,3ckpvo,Rhexysexy,21,Wed Jul 8 17:47:30 2015 UTC,"Q1: The Vortigaunts were enslaved by the Nihilanth in HL1 and were forced to attack Earth. When Gordon killed the Nihilanth the Vorts were freed from its rule, but the resonance cascade continued. Some time after that, the Combine empire (presumably) invaded Xen, causing the Vorts to flee to Earth, until Earth too was conquered and turned into another part of the Combine's empire. The Vorts and humans therefore have a common enemy: The Combine. They also see Gordon as a quasi-religious figure due to him liberating them from their original master.  Q2: Vortigaunts are a sapient species. Other Xen creatures are not, and are more like wild animals.  Q3: HL2 takes place 20 years after the original game. Dr. Breen (who was the administrator of Black Mesa) orders the Combine Overwatch to capture him once he appears in his office mid-teleport. The reason for this is because Breen wants to capture or kill all surviving members of the original Black Mesa Science Team so that they cannot attempt to overthrow him or the Combine.  Q4: 20 years is plenty of time to learn a language."

HalfLife,3ckpvo,JohnFreemanWhoWas,9,Wed Jul 8 19:13:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. The alien grunts were all artificially created in factories in Xen, and if I remember correctly the writer of the series (Marc Laidlaw) said that they stopped being produced after the Nihilanth's defeat. Whatever alien grunts were left on Earth after HL1 would have died from starvation or disease or would have fallen victim to human, Combine or other Xen forces, which is why they didn't appear in HL2.  Gordon was in stasis in the pocket dimension that G-Man left him in. From his point of view, he was on the tram one minute, and being woken up by the G-Man the next."

HalfLife,3ckpvo,i_rabban,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:21:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said, except:   Some time after that, the Combine empire (presumably) invaded Xen   I'm quite sure that Xen had become a Combine colony some time prior to the events of Half-Life 1. Nihilanth is essentially the Xen equivalent of Dr. Breen - an administrator on the Combine's behalf.  The Combine are the ones who enslaved and suppressed the Vortigaunts - the Nihilanth was just a middle man. The Alien Grunts are the equivalent of the transhuman Overwatch - they're genetically engineered Vortigaunts, designed to be easily controlled, to be able to fit into the natural environment of the dominant species of Xen and possibly be able to interact with the native species more easily. The Alien Controllers might even be more heavily modified Vortigaunts as well, or they might be a related species - the middle feeding arm protruding from their chests, similar to Vortigaunts, suggests that they're originally the same species, or at least closely related. The Nihilanth has so many similarities with the Alien Controllers, that he is quite likely an even more modified variant of these - and thus, can also trace his origins back to the Vortigaunts (the reason that I believe this feeding arm is enough evidence for them to be related, is that there are no other Xen creatures that have a similar appendage).  In addition, the Vortigaunt ""janitor"" you can see in the opening of Half-Life 2, right after getting off the train, still sports his green slave-bracers and necklace. Since that janitor is in service of the Combine, and is subject to the same type of subservience technology (the green bracers) that his kin were all wearing 20 years ago, it suggests that the Combine were the race that had enslaved the Vortigaunts from the first game as well."

HalfLife,3cnbkr,ShaneD53,6,Thu Jul 9 06:11:10 2015 UTC,"An open-world style game would not fit the Half-Life franchise at all, even a semi-open/semi-linear hybrid would be awful. The reason all the games in the series are as good as they are is banking on the ability for fine tuning by linearity. As for the pic, everything points to it being not real. Why would Valve even put an extremely important game alpha on Steam? They have experience with getting their early game states stolen, I doubt they'd rely on an online service to distribute anything related to Half-Life 3. Anyways, if they DID put something like this on Steam, I'm sure we would have many more stolen images like this one that would point to this picture being anything but a well done edit job."

If even Blue Shift has you beat on space portions, you really gotta step up your game! Still, Valve completely wrote out a need for Xen, which sucks because I feel like a Combine homeworld would look a lot more industrialized and bleak than the colorful flora and skyboxes that Xen had. Although, Xen did have industrial portions and those had some very cool things to mess around with, so it might not be too bad after all."

Also, worth pointing out that they have a european office in Luxembourg meaning that this could just be someone testing out the game at home, again, plausible as Valve is trusting on the threat of their own legal team as well as their industry support to stop game builds from leaking."

But the one figure that has always eluded me is the Gordon Freeman Action figure, since it came out before I had started collecting figures.  Now I'm also a Gordon Freeman cosplayer and Half-Life is one of my favorite game universes and stories. So Getting Gordon Freeman on my desk has been a huge goal of mine for quite some time, as most figures typically go for $120+. But I lucked out and managed to find this one for cheap and well within my rare figure budget!   Count me one happy buyer if it stays true to it's listing and is new in box!"

We know Adrian and Calhoun talk, they just didn't speak ingame. The same is likely with Gordon. They never said Gordon doesn't speak in Half-Life 2, Alyx just said, ""A man of few words, aren't you?"" Few, not none (I know this is just a saying, but still)."
HalfLife,3ceumu,HalfLife1MasterRace,11,Tue Jul 7 15:01:56 2015 UTC,I feel the same. This reminds me of Metro 2033 where it is obvious the character Artyom is talking to them but they don't (for whatever reason) make him talk during gameplay.

HalfLife,3ceumu,AyCeeKay,9,Tue Jul 7 13:36:11 2015 UTC,The theory could work with the Gman's 'illusion of free choice'.   Gordon could have been under his control before the resonance cascade. The Gman could have injected Gordon into the facility. He would have handled all of Gordon's paperwork and perhaps forged his qualifications. Maybe even worked with Kliener to get Gordon in.  Gordon wouldn't know any different as he would have been designed with the belief of having his own life (assuming he isn't completely brain-dead... which would allow him to talk alittle)  Gordon (and likely the Gman) could well be hatched Shu'ulathoi. Breengrub tells us that they can take on any form they wish when they hatch. This could explain a ton. Can't go into details now as I'm at work but it's a theory I've had for a while.
HalfLife,3ceumu,AboveDisturbing,3,Tue Jul 7 15:09:54 2015 UTC,"That's making it seriously philosophical. How do we know for sure that all is f Gordon's experiences up to BM were not fabricated, or that Gordon was created specifically for the purpose by gman to be a means to some end?  It's a last Thursdayism type of argument; how do we know that the entire world in its complexity with thoughts and memories were not created last Thursday?  Honestly, for a company that is obviously in it for the money and not the art, I think this line of thinking is highly flattering."
HalfLife,3ceumu,_FRANKENSTEIN_,2,Tue Jul 7 19:38:43 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Fits well with the whole 'keep it science-y' thing too.
HalfLife,3ceumu,JALUNATIC,2,Tue Jul 7 21:01:49 2015 UTC,"According to that theory, what happened when Vorts blocked G-Man? he, referring to Gordon said: ""we'll see about that"", obviously G-Man couldn't predict that happening, he was going to tell gordon something (to control him) but was stopped so maybe Gordon.exe should have stopped working?  Oh and how would you explain this, it looks like at some point Valve did think about Gordon's emotions which Brain dead people aren't capable of showing."
HalfLife,3ceumu,talktochuckfinley,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:25:34 2015 UTC,"You're right, he probably would have stopped working. Never read that thing from Marc before - it's amazing so thank you for sharing it.   I'd probably trim back my idea of Gordon being a husk of a man now. The theory still intrigues me without that premise.  We never get to see how Gordon feels about the whole Gman being pushed back thing. The events that transpire after kind of shoehorn Gordon into various scenarios before the Gman contacts him again. Perhaps as Marc mentions, it is down to us to decide how we feel. Some of us longed for the Gman's contact whilst others preferred to remain away from his interference - to help Alyx.  It's so damn complicated. I'd love to like, set everything on the table. Get a big fat diagram. See which faction wants what, try to figure it all out. But then I'd just look crazy."

HalfLife,3chczj,uberneuntausend,3,Tue Jul 7 23:15:51 2015 UTC,"I think it makes sense. Portal gun affects space. Gravity gun affects gravity. Why not introduce a time gun as they are all so intertwined. It'd be a nice way to wrap up the series.  Just depends on how it works. Are you reversing time for a few moments Prince of Persia style. That could be fun and have solid puzzles built off it. Not too original though.  Or are you moving time in certain areas (where you point your gun at)? So you can stop bullets, move out of harms way and then allow them to carry on, destroying enemies behind you. You could stop enemies in their tracks, then move things around to freak them out, as they would see objects magically appearing/disappearing. Guard in your way? Speed up time for him until he has to take a leak. This could also incorporate the reversal of time too. hmm. That would be fun!"

Portals are hard to make and it isnt something you see often in popculture (the way they are portrayed in Portal games), gravity gun is a totally new thing, where as a thing that rolls back time is depicted countless of times before.  Its quite easy to make such weapon, if it works on lets say given objects or whole map in general. Time manipulation was already covered in HL 2 when Alyx and Gordon teleport in weeks after they attempt to free Eli from Nova prospect. I think that concept of going back and saving Eli (or anyone) is also a cliche, so I'd hate to see it myself."

HalfLife,3chczj,AymericTheNightmare,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:46:21 2015 UTC,"Simple   Exactly why it is not going to happen.  A ""time gun"" is the first thing that comes to your mind when you think about half life 3, it would be too easy for valve.  But I'm certain that there will be something ""time/space"" related.  I read somewhere that the borealis teleported itself or something, why would it not ""reteleport"" itself when gordon enters it? What if it teleports itself 20 years back in time, and gordon becomes the ratman and saves chell?  And then in portal 3 chell saves the world instead of gordon"

HalfLife,3c8wp3,Badhamknibbs,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:57:14 2015 UTC,Why do the people look like they're jello come to life?
HalfLife,3c8wp3,Riomaki,2,Mon Jul 6 11:44:19 2015 UTC,"You see this in the original Unreal Tournament as well.  Basically, to keep animations simple, the coordinates of vertices in the model are rounded off.  Since the locations of these individual vertices are getting rounded (something that should mathematically be at 3.1415 is at 3.1, for example), the polygons that make up the overall model can't keep a consistent shape and therefore the whole thing looks wobbly.  This is also what gives PlayStation 1 games their characteristic texture jostling, which is especially noticeable if you play a racing game and observe the lines on the road.  That system could only do integer math, so there wasn't very much precision."

VNN is pretty openly about speculation, which is why I like them. There is no point in having two serious valve news channels, so we have one that's serious and one that's for fun speculation. I don't see what's wrong with that.  And while it's true a lot of his speculation is unlikely it's still just speculation, and openly so. Not to mention it's still possible, just not likely.

One of the most hyped games ever.  And now, you have the opportunity to expose it to the world.  Why in the world would you take a picture of the loading screen?  The least interesting screen in the entire game.  A screen that doesn't show off anything.

Taking a closer look at things, nothing could be real, no one will really believe anything unless it look 100% real, anything as the slightest stench of being fake will set off red flags. When you look at supposed 'leaks', everyone will always look at the big picture, not just take it lightly because this is a serious matter of which HL3 could be a thing happening soon or not.

HalfLife,3c54rj,clonetrooper250,12,Sun Jul 5 01:38:28 2015 UTC,"Actually, much of the level is off-road, and you simply follow the coastline. That may be the source of OP's confusion."

HalfLife,3c54rj,SuperWeegee4000,9,Sun Jul 5 02:31:37 2015 UTC,The Combine might have built a railway over it.
HalfLife,3c54rj,H_Grunt,3,Sun Jul 5 02:59:49 2015 UTC,"The actual reason is, the bridge was originally a road bridge in the HL2 leak. Probably stayed as such until late in the development, after the map texture was already made."

You didn't find it odd the like three separate instances of headcrab zombies walking in a straight single-file line towards you?  One sawblade, 6 dead zombies. Easier than any gun.  Literally the only part that was actually difficult was waiting for the elevator, cause you have to kite the fast zombies so you can aim towards the fence and not lose your blade off the top of the building."
HalfLife,3c22yv,IronicTitanium,14,Sat Jul 4 02:40:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why Ravenholm was my favorite chapter in Half-Life 2.

Easily my favorite part of HL2"
HalfLife,3c22yv,woodshop20,3,Sat Jul 4 06:19:16 2015 UTC,"For that part, jump off the roof, back onto the landing and run back into the building. Just hide in there until the cart arrives cos the zombies can't open doors."

HalfLife,3c4shz,kingkolton9,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:22:50 2015 UTC,"Look, it's really well crafted and the level design is top notch, but come on, the voice acting is abysmal."
HalfLife,3c4shz,Gondile,2,Sun Jul 5 05:40:11 2015 UTC,It's abysmal compared to what? Maybe compared to professional voice actors? I know I'm defending it a little too much but you don't often see high quality mods like this one and criticising something done on zero budget seems pointless in this case.
HalfLife,3c4shz,Flix1,4,Sun Jul 5 06:20:40 2015 UTC,"It's not pointless, it's just criticism. I'm not personally attacking their product, just acknowledging an aspect I found inferior. Just because it is free does not mean it is free from critique."

HalfLife,3c207q,_FRANKENSTEIN_,2,Sat Jul 4 08:35:05 2015 UTC,Anyone else find the CrossPlayer idea interesting? I've always thought the ability to play as an NPC in someones singleplayer campaign would be pretty cool.

HalfLife,3bzdcj,SergeshD123,23,Sat Jul 4 04:45:01 2015 UTC,"They are developing HL3.  EDIT: Also, please note that HL's 'average interest' is higher than TF's and Portal's, and comparing it to Dota's, which is a multiplayer game that will never die, is kinda unfair."
HalfLife,3bzdcj,Skau130,17,Fri Jul 3 14:44:11 2015 UTC,"IIRC Gabe hinted they're not working on it, and said they'll only do it if a team comes forward with a good reason"
HalfLife,3bzdcj,Jesuschrist2011,17,Fri Jul 3 14:55:20 2015 UTC,"Saying that you will not make a classic SP game sound quite diffent to saying that you'll not make that long awaited game that everyone wants, but it seems that I'm the only one to think this way."

HalfLife,3bzdcj,Nebulous_Idea,-7,Fri Jul 3 16:09:26 2015 UTC,He basically said they were not making it and they probably wouldnt. But its possible they would do it  Edit: downvoted for telling the truth. Gabe literally said if we dont have a good reason we wont do it. Honestly you guys cling to the stupidest shit. I want hl3 to but ive come to realize that not everything is a clue and that it probably wont be made because even Valve cant answer what the hell is happening in the game
HalfLife,3bzdcj,monkeysrule123,4,Fri Jul 3 19:10:28 2015 UTC,"He said they wont do like a ""classic style game"" which ""doesnt necessarily mean what you think it means""  That sounds more like its just going to be very different from the previous games, not that it wouldnt be made at all."
HalfLife,3bzdcj,Max_Valentino,-3,Fri Jul 3 23:32:21 2015 UTC,"I interpret that as, they wont do a game that is classic. Aka half life or portal or left for dead. Maybe hl3 will be made like a brand new game. Like half life but its a telltale game. Or hl3 online"
HalfLife,3bzdcj,monkeysrule123,3,Sat Jul 4 00:32:02 2015 UTC,"Well then what did he mean by ""that doesnt necessarily mean what you think it means""?  I imagine they are experimenting with both vr and new types of co-op, similar to what they were doing with the crossing.  https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/3c207q/an_exclusive_look_at_the_crossing_database_episode/"
HalfLife,3bzdcj,Max_Valentino,-3,Sat Jul 4 00:56:56 2015 UTC,It means he isnt ruling out half life at the moment but he isn't making it either. The whole point of him even saying anything was to get us talking though
HalfLife,3bzdcj,monkeysrule123,4,Sat Jul 4 01:52:02 2015 UTC,"Everyone's quoting Gabe but missing his point. He said that nobody would go back and make a classic ""single-player ONLY"" traditional game, and ignore everything they learned with Portal 2 etc. in terms of the multiplayer additions. That doesn't mean they're just not going to make the next half life. The next half life doesn't have to be a strictly traditional classic style singleplayer only half life.  This most likely means they won't be making HL3 as a traditional Half Life game where you play it once and then you're done, left only to experience the replay value, but they are probably developing it differently, taking into account everything that worked with Portal 2 and other titles.  My point is that nobody ever said they aren't working on Half Life."
HalfLife,3bzdcj,super6plx,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:05:18 2015 UTC,"He said that the only way Valve would go back and make some kind of retro-style game is if a bunch of people at Valve wanted to make a retro product.  The he said that he felt making another Half-Life without using what they've learned with games like DoTA 2 or Portal 2 would be a huge mistake, but it doesn't mean what people are worried it might mean.  Sounds like he wants to implement something more than just a campaign, possibly some kind of co-op a la Portal 2 or Left 4 Dead.  I think they honestly just have bigger fish to fry at this point in time.  They can't just abandon a projects like TF2, DoTA 2, or CS:GO for several years to go make Half-Life 3.  They're more than just games at this point, they're assets.  They need to be maintained or else Valve risks losing players, which means losing money.  Then you have projects like Steam Machines, Steam OS, the controller, Vive, etc. all being worked on as well.  Not to mention just maintaining the leviathan of Steam itself."
HalfLife,3bzdcj,bothanspy1337,-2,Tue Jul 7 08:30:18 2015 UTC,"He also implied what a good reason would be. That being their current in-game purchases system failing, which it's not and won't be for a long long time.  Sad to say we won't be seeing HL3 as long as Valve keeps tf2, cs:go and dota 2 interesting."
HalfLife,3bzdcj,Ultimate_Cabooser,6,Fri Jul 3 15:05:25 2015 UTC,"If you add the term ""Counter-Strike"" all other terms get dwarfed.   and Even that one is on a steady down slope. So no, I don't think google trends is how Valve gauges interest in their properties."

HalfLife,3bzdcj,david2777,3,Sat Jul 4 00:39:30 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, for HL3 to be a faithful follow-up to HL2, it needs to be a perfect example of gameplay+VR as HL2 was gameplay+physics. It would be the perfect way to generate buzz for Vive and VR in general.  It's also worth noting that the way NDAs work, it's probably most effective for a signatory to outright deny working on a title.  Fallout 4 flew under the radar surprisingly well, with the exception of one leak a year or two ago that turned out to be accurate (only confirmation was when the game was actually presented), although it was swept under the rug fairly quickly."
HalfLife,3bzdcj,Destructerator,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:00:13 2015 UTC,That's a really good point about fallout 4 which to be honest has many times more fans than half life. They kept it under wraps pretty well. Kinda gives you hope. However Bethesda need their games to make money so...
HalfLife,3bzdcj,Flix1,4,Fri Jul 3 22:16:32 2015 UTC,If they paid any attention to market interest we'd already have you know what.   3 points 3 hours ago      You know what confirmed

HalfLife,3bzdcj,Best_Towel_EU,2,Fri Jul 3 16:21:21 2015 UTC,"If you also add the search term ""Half Life"", which is what most people would type rather than adding the hyphen in the middle, you'll get this  If there's that huge of a spike with the release of HL2 in 2004 then I'm sure there'd be an even bigger one today just from HL3 being announced."
HalfLife,3bzdcj,Scottyxander,2,Fri Jul 3 16:11:13 2015 UTC,"Valve is not just any company. They're not only industry leaders; they define the industry and hence the relevant market. They are ""movers and shakers"" to use the parlance of the finance sector."
HalfLife,3bzdcj,paxperscientiam,5,Sat Jul 4 07:35:47 2015 UTC,"I know I personally have given up that there will ever be a Half-Life 3.  That has always been my favorite series, but honestly I've moved on- there was a great fan theory about portal 2 actually being the end of the series and I really liked that.  Gabe's recent statements sure sounded like they have given up on it too."
HalfLife,3bzdcj,Mr_IsLand,-1,Fri Jul 3 15:07:06 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. Which is a shame, considering how popular Black Mesa is."
HalfLife,3bzdcj,RoboNerdOK,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:07:07 2015 UTC,"In a way, yes. Why do you think they built and released Portal 2 first? Because chances are that Portal was a greater interest in the market than Ep2 was in The Orange Box."
HalfLife,3bzdcj,smashitup,2,Fri Jul 3 14:36:31 2015 UTC,I think it was because there were no expectations to live up to. No one was expecting Portal 2. Everyone is expecting HL3 to be as epic as HL1 And HL2. It's almost an impossible task.
HalfLife,3bzdcj,mithrasinvictus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:36:38 2015 UTC,"Actually, developers have come out and said that it was because a bunch of people at Valve wanted to make a Portal game.

HalfLife,3byzta,ThatOneSlowking,2,Tue Jul 7 07:03:54 2015 UTC,"Sure, that wouldn't be bad at all. But a real upgrade system as part of the game, where you customize your suit and weapons, would mean that the gameplay in any given level couldn't be controlled by the level designer.  Every level would be made to be doable with any set of upgrades a player might take, which usually leads to the whole game being too easy. If you don't have the speed upgrade you can't sprint through this open area, so they can't have a dangerous open area you need to sprint through because some players might not be able to do it. If you don't have the reload speed upgrade you won't be able to handle really intense firefights, so they can't make any fight too intense because you can't survive it if you took different upgrades.  Plenty of games have things like this, and some do it very well, but there's no reason to make Half-Life one of them when it's historically had superb level design as one of its biggest strengths."
HalfLife,3byzta,TheScyphozoa,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:17:15 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more of quality of life upgrades, such as increased suit power or larger ammo capacity, things that aren't insanely useful, but just nice to have. You still are bottlenecked by reloading and finding ammo, and it isn't required to use the extra sprint for anything. Things that wouldn't really be vital to solving levels or firefights, but still nice to have."

FO4: I think that this is less about consoles and more about time budgeting. Making high-end graphics means less time to make the game, you know, good. Besides, Bethesda knows that their modding community will do graphics for them, so all they have to do is do enough work to please the console crowd.  JC3: Keep in mind that JC2 MP wasn't even an official thing. Avalanche did not work on it.  Anyway, Valve has never sacrificed for consoles in the past. I doubt they will this time around."

Yes, their games come out on console, but the differences between the PC versions and the console versions are staggering.  Everything they've done recently is about bringing PC to the living room, the console's domain. Why on earth would you, even for a second, believe that they would elect to allow the consoles to influence their design."
HalfLife,3byzta,-The_Blazer-,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:05:50 2015 UTC,Here are two good reasons to convince you. Valve will compete against consoles not only on PC but with their own console. Steam boxes should generally outgun xbone and PS4 on the graphics side no problem. By not holding back the visuals they can argue the superiority of their own console product. Another one is that Valve have never held back to cater to puny peasant consoles in the past so it's very likely they won't now or in the future.
HalfLife,3byzta,CoffeeWaffee,0,Fri Jul 3 22:29:24 2015 UTC,"I think that consoles have been holding back gaming, too, but I'm not sure where you heard about JC3's multiplayer. The way I understood it is that they didn't work on multiplayer because it just wasn't worth the resources spent, much like the devs of Wolfenstein: The New Order. Planetside 2 can do 1000+ multiplayer on PS4, so I'm not sure if the console was the limitation in that case.  That said, Valve is a PC company. If that game ever comes out it's going to use the PC to its full potential, and then it will be skimmed down for consoles later on."
HalfLife,3byzta,Flix1,-5,Sat Jul 4 11:31:57 2015 UTC,"I hate the word downgrading. Back in the old days, people would just say optimisation.  Not that it's anything you need to worry about anyway for Half Life 3/Episode 3, it'll probably be on PC platforms first and they might throw in a console release later. Even if there is a 'downgrade' it won't be as bad as other games (I reckon) since the Source engine's pretty good at running on anything and still looking acceptable.   It'll be fine."

The smart use of color, lighting and texture combinations causes your imagination to recall it more vividly than it actually is.  I feel that's something which has been lost over time.  When you look back on older video games, you don't think of pixels.  Your imagination fills in these details that weren't actually there.  And I think that's why we have an emotional connection with so many older games, because we invested our own creativity into them.  Now, there is no room for that.  Everything is rendered to the nth degree, spelled out exactly so there's no confusion.  Your buckle yourself in for the precise visuals the developer wanted to show and you experience it almost on a passive, movie-like level.  It's pretty, but it's boring.  It's like the movie translation of a book.  It's rarely as good as what your imagination made up."

Besides ""just"" being good at being a SciFi-shooter game ofc, as if that wasn't already hard enough.  And find it impressing how many of HL's elements still are untouched and not copied by any game yet, despite its influence on the whole industry. For example, I don't know a single game that pulls of those crazy genre transitions. You know, like, from the whole action-movie-ish driving stuff in water hazard to the rather friendly atmosphere in Black Mesa East and then directly to the horror section, Ravenholm."
HalfLife,3bo1wd,-The_Blazer-,8,Wed Jul 1 00:25:17 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. What I like the most about HL2 is just its huge variety. Every single chapter is a brand-new environment, new game mechanics, new enemies... It's as if you're not playing one game, but 12 (or as many chapters the game has, can't remember exactly now).  I don't like how a lot of new games, as good as they can be, present you with similar environments all the time. Example: Spec Ops: The Line: amazing story-driven game, but Jesus all the sand and wrecked buildings get boring after a while."

I saw a BM LP before playing HL, so I got all exited when I was in questionable ethics, getting ready for that fight. When that part didn't exist, the disappointment was real. But yeah, in Black Mesa the marines are practically aimbots, and due to me refusing to play on lower difficulties than hard (I play all games on the third difficulty level,  the game also has massive difficulty spikes, too easy on easy and normal. I remember playing that place on normal and easy and started getting annoyed with the fact that instead of bulletsponge marines I got bulletsponge Freeman) I die like a frog.

HalfLife,3bo1wd,vakomatic,2,Wed Jul 1 02:45:38 2015 UTC,I'm not buying the game until it gets its damn ending cos I want to play through it in one go. Otherwise I won't have enough self-control to leave the game sitting there in my library with 0 hours played.
HalfLife,3bo1wd,antaymonkey,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:07:25 2015 UTC,"It's just an ending really, the fun is in the game itself, not the story. Playing through HL2 is really fun, and it has a proper ending. Its episodes are also really fun, but you don't have an ending yet, but it's meant to be enjoyed without an ending anyway. It's a game not a film, so it's still really fun to play.  What you could do is wait until Christmas or something when everything goes to a 75% discount, buy it then, and then you can let it sit there until HL3 comes out knowing that eventually you'd buy it and you saved a lot of money! That's what I do sometimes (I had a Mac and bought the Orange Box really cheap and waited years to play it as there was no Mac versions yet)."

HalfLife,3bo1wd,ExtraCheesyPie,3,Tue Jun 30 22:18:12 2015 UTC,"As much as I love the characters and the atmosphere, I wish the story was a little more cohesive. In ways the games are scripted like TV shows, and the overall development of the story wasn't really thought out that well from the beginning. That's probably my only complaint aside from the usual squad AI and mediocre gunplay, but here's hoping HL3 fixes that up."
HalfLife,3bo1wd,Basspants,2,Tue Jun 30 22:41:40 2015 UTC,"Oh they're definitely not perfect, no game is. If you want a flaw (and believe you me, the list is short), I'd for sure say the squad commands in 'anticitizen' and 'follow freeman'. It feels like it was shoved in, and really serves no purpose since the NPCs follow you and target enemies anyway. Plus they got in the way and blew my cover loads of times. I ended up using them as human Snarks, shoving them through an opening and letting them test the waters and get soaked in bullets."

HalfLife,3bo1wd,chibinchobin,8,Wed Jul 1 03:09:48 2015 UTC,"I got this. (For those out there who have already seen this, quit getting butthurt, you know who you are)  Barney left on the first train with some survivors at the end of Episode 1. Seeing as how Gordon and Alyx just barely were in the blast radius/shock wave from the Dark Fusion reactor, it's safe to say Barney's train was safely able to continue on it's way.  So the question is where did that train go. We know that Gordon and Alyx's original destination with the train is White Forest, but there is no indication, not even a mention of him. Due to the timing of the Mossman's reveal of the location of the Borealis, there really isn't any reasoning that Barney is in the Arctic either.  So where is he? A simple answer could be that he is at another base, keeping the rebels organized. I don't think Valve would just drop Barney though, he has become an important, if not endearing character to the story.  Perhaps, just maybe, Gman has taken notice of him. Perhaps he is in stasis, and Gman is going to bring him back just when he needs him. That could help explain if Barney is bizarrely in the Arctic for no reason. Patience, my brothers, we shall see."

HalfLife,3boomc,Willy_Fogg,18,Tue Jun 30 22:17:21 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that Fallout 3 and New Vegas don't really use cutscenes.  You converse with hundreds of NPCs with dialog options, but you are rarely forced to watch something without input.  The BioShock series, as well, keeps everything ""in character.""  I'm actually not a huge fan of the way HL2 does its scripted sequences because they are, in essence, unskippable cutscenes.  Yes, I can move around, but there are several instances where the scene is just playing without any invitation for the player to participate.  It's like saying that something is no longer a cutscene if you can reposition the camera.  No, in my opinion, unless the player has meaningful input, it's still a cutscene.  Don't get me wrong, it's wonderful to watch them the first time through, but on subsequent plays, I just want to skip past them.  That bit where you're awkwardly waiting around in Eli's lab before Alyx and Mossman argue is a prime example."
HalfLife,3boomc,Riomaki,5,Wed Jul 1 01:21:35 2015 UTC,But you have always the choice of explore everything around you thats the important thing   and that's another thing that makes half-life different from any other games
HalfLife,3boomc,EngineerDogIta,2,Wed Jul 1 09:44:56 2015 UTC,"It's still a slog in subsequent playthroughs. I don't mind so much in Eli's lab where I can fiddle with his machines and look at newspaper clippings, but in EP2 waiting around for Magnusson and listening to Eli drone on about the Borealis, it's definitely an unskippable cutscene with nothing to do except throw a little cactus around."
HalfLife,3boomc,Unkawaii,0,Fri Jul 3 02:30:55 2015 UTC,"yup that is a episode, it's like the expansions for half-life, it's one of the reasons why valve leaved the episodic model for half-life sequels"
HalfLife,3boomc,EngineerDogIta,16,Sat Jul 4 10:57:23 2015 UTC,"no sequences that take the control away from you still keep 100% control in the hands of the player.   Yes, in the Kleiner's teleports, and later the Stalker Pod you have 100% control of looking left or right. The choice is yours! Really, what's the difference? If anything it's worse because the ""cutscenes"" are completely unskippable, and if it isn't a teleport it's getting in a very slow lift or getting locked in a room until everyone there has had their monologue, urgh. HL1, as far as I know, had only three or four of those at the end and beginning - the Test Chamber and control room, and then the Lambda Complex control room. there are a couple of others, but they're all short and to the point - no screwing around with ""Alyx doesn't like Judith and Eli wants Gordon out of the suit and Cubbage wants to teach Gordon how to use the RPG and JUST LET ME WORK, DAMNIT!""! Let me get on with my job, turning Combine skulls into mashed potatoes. I've played this before, I know the story, SHUT UP already and give me the damn rocket launcher.   And while I'm at it - no, I'm NOT going to give up my infinite SMG ammo just because you insist. I'm going to jam it half way in and use it anyway, because that's what happens when you FORCE a player down a path instead of making him INTERESTED in what's at the end! By god, you got this right in HL1 - gimme a gun, interesting and fun environments, and engaging hints at a larger story told through the environment that can be totally ignored if I've seen it all before! GO-argh-OD!  PS. Sorry for the rant."
HalfLife,3boomc,2-4601,12,Tue Jun 30 23:53:01 2015 UTC,"Oh god, I totally disagree with that. I don't want them to just ""shut up already and give me the damn rocket launcher"". There's no cadence in that, just constant run-and-gun. If I want that, I'll play Doom.  This isn't to say, mind you, that your view is invalid. I think it is a valid point. But one of the ways HL2 succeeded for me was that it had a much richer narrative and characterisation than the first game, yet it didn't become some kind of Metal Gear Solid experience where you get a huge cut scene every five minutes.  I suppose that it's a difficult balance to strike. If a game is going to inject more narrative into the mix, there are many ways this can be achieved. Half-Life 2 really perfected the art of creating a carefully-constructed narrative path that still gives the player a sense of control/movement/interaction.  ""Short and to the point"", and ""minimal monologues"" aren't at all what I'm looking for, personally. I'd be disappointed if a future Half-Life title went that way. From my perspective, HL2 is an evolution from the original in that regard.  So I think Valve has good design in this area, but even so, the presence of additional narrative where a player may want no narrative is an inherent contradiction.  If Valve had allowed you to skip the beautiful scripted sequences in Half-Life 2, would that have addressed your concern?"
HalfLife,3boomc,morphic-monkey,5,Wed Jul 1 07:00:30 2015 UTC,"If a game is going to inject more narrative into the mix, there are many ways this can be achieved. Half-Life 2 really perfected the art of creating a carefully-constructed narrative path that still gives the player a sense of control/movement/interaction.     HL1 had story elements as well, but they were integrated into gameplay - you could see it in how bullsquids would hunt Headcrabs, how Xen's monsters stated to look more and more like a regular army with Manta Rays dropping troops off into warzones and laying biological landmines to secure areas just as the HECU had done. It did not make you go in a room and get lectured at by the science team about how Xen was an organised military force and not let you leave until you understood. Doing that is the opposite of gamplay integration because there is no gameplay.   If Valve had allowed you to skip the beautiful scripted sequences in Half-Life 2, would that have addressed your concern?   Yes. Just make a simple dialogue option, like ""Hey, my Dad wants to see you, but if you want we can practice with the Gravity Gun first?"" and just have two doors leading out of the room. And I don't have a problem with scripted sequences per se, like the factory chimney toppling during the Airboat chase, just the ones that make you sit down and get a cup of tea while they play out."
HalfLife,3boomc,2-4601,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:50:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so I think the solution here is to give the player the ability to skip these. Personally, I much preferred the HL2 approach to the first game; the scripted ""cut scenes"" were really well made and well written, but the fact that I was able to move around and there were some key interaction points, made them feel much more lively.  But if there were some option to hit a skip button, I wouldn't be against that, especially if I wanted to do multiple playthroughs or something."
HalfLife,3boomc,morphic-monkey,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:18:31 2015 UTC,"I don't see it as a mutually exclusive thing.  What they should have done was have a way to branch the sequence for a player that wants to move on.  Like, for example, let's say during a sequence, I'm supposed to flip a switch.  If I run over there and pull the switch early, you could branch the sequence with ""Oh, look, Gordon's raring to go.  Let's not waste any more time then!""  Not only does that give less patient players what they want, but I'd argue it enhances the experience overall because the NPCs are reacting to something you did."
HalfLife,3boomc,Riomaki,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:09:00 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but I think that would be very difficult to do because there are many different scenarios to consider.

HalfLife,3boomc,reuben_,2,Thu Jul 2 15:17:22 2015 UTC,"Also (thanks for dinging me, by the way) backtracking is a good thing in moderation because it means you can put more effort into the setting since you'll be getting more out of it. HL2 went the other way with long, linear segments of the coastal road that honestly didn't any different from each other - drive some more, shoot up a Combine ambush, drive through a tunnel/loading screen...if you compare that to the level design of Blast Pit (one of HL1's best), I'd honestly prefer to creep around the tentacles a few more times than drive, shoot, and drive.  EDIT: Indeed, backtracking around an interesting level was reintroduced in Episode One's Citadel Reactor after Adam Foster (MINERVA's creator) signed on, and IMO it was a great improvement."
HalfLife,3boomc,2-4601,2,Thu Jul 2 15:38:19 2015 UTC,"I really disagree on ""Half-Life 1 knew how to balance gameplay and storyline"". I have a lot of fun with Half-Life 1's gameplay for the first half of the game. Then it's just the same gameplay, the same environments over and over again. And some enemies are just bullshit. I'm looking at you Alien Grunt. Giving a enemie a fuck ton of HP and projectiles that you can't escape from is not fun. And after you finished a pretty difficult session of combat, they drop you in into another one, because they don't have the occasional story sequences to actually pace the game well. And while I can understand why Half-Life 2's unskippable ""cutscenes"" can get pretty annoying as you replay, it's much better than: Go into this room, kill everything, go into this room, kill that, go into that room, kills this..."

It was a name with a lot of character, so he went with it.  This entry was very useful when I was making Avenue Odessa, a mod based around Odessa being stuck in City 17.  To me, Odessa is one of the most interesting characters in the Half-Life 2 canon because he's essentially a con man who can only be trusted to do what's most advantageous for him.  Of course, we ended up embellishing that aspect of him, as does the Adventures of Hercule Cubbage.  In HL2 itself, you'd be forgiven for thinking he's just a stereotypical NPC in a modern video game - the kind that parks himself in front of a location and speaks the same two lines - rather than pick up on his cowardice."

HalfLife,3bm24p,EmperorFlipFlops,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:31:45 2015 UTC,"If i remember correctly, the borealis was already on the way out of the story by the time the leak came out. Valve didnt have much of a game completed when the leak came out, so they had to cut a LOT of stuff to finish the game within a year."
HalfLife,3bm24p,Canker17,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:52:54 2015 UTC,"CONCLUSION:  * The beta was an absolute, incomplete mess. * Obessa Cubbage is an awesome name"
HalfLife,3bm24p,EmperorFlipFlops,15,Thu Jul 2 22:10:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe it just wasn't that interesting.  There's only so much you can do on a ship layout-wise, architecturally, etc.  It doesn't fit Valve's sprawling design style.  As a point of reference, consider the ship at the start of the first COD: Modern Warfare.  It's very forward-and-back, claustrophobic - that design doesn't fit the HL style very well.  On a high level, Bridge Point is as close as HL2 gets to this kind of design, but that feels way more open than a ship, despite being the same forward-and-back design.  Keep in mind, at that point, Aperture and Portal weren't created yet.  So, it was literally just a ship.  Chances are they looked at all the other environments on their plate and thought the idea wasn't as strong as the others."
HalfLife,3bm24p,Riomaki,6,Tue Jun 30 15:03:39 2015 UTC,"I feel like a ship would be perfect for a game. Mazing layout, all compacted - gotta minimize memory and load times."

HalfLife,3bm24p,EmperorFlipFlops,3,Thu Jul 2 08:32:30 2015 UTC,"I watched a talk with Chet Falizek and Erik Wolpaw recently on Portal 2.  They said that they never stop getting asked why stuff was cut and how that stuff always looked so cool—Chet even said that there's a very vocal minority that swears that the unreleased beta of Left 4 Dead is superior to the shipping game.  They said that stuff is always cut for a reason.  It's not like they find something cool then just scrap it.  Usually, it ends up being boring or awkward; I assume Borealis had similar issues.  Also, Half-Life has plenty of claustrophobic design:  Lots of HL1 had  you in smaller areas, HL2 had Ravenholm, Episode 1 had the sewers in almost complete darkness with hordes of zombies, and Episode 2 had the mines.  It isn't what Half-Life is known for, but it's still very much a trait in most of the games."
HalfLife,3bm24p,bothanspy1337,3,Tue Jun 30 17:30:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, let me explain what I meant by forward-and-back a little better.  A ship is a long object, not a wide one.  So, as a result, the level mostly trends in two directions - forward and back.  The path doesn't jog to the left or right very often, it's just straight ahead because that's how a ship is.  This can feel limiting and monotonous to the player.  It's alright for an introductory level, as Modern Warfare's was, because you've removed a one axis of complexity for the player to worry about.  But it's not a very good design for the kind of freeform run-and-gun battles that HL does, imo."
HalfLife,3bm24p,Riomaki,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:43:15 2015 UTC,"i mean, while they also have big sprawling areas, a lot of the half life series is super claustrophobic. so i am not sure what you are talking about lol"

HalfLife,3bncu0,kingkolton9,3,Tue Jun 30 18:25:02 2015 UTC,No it's taking so long because Valve haven't been working on it constantly for the past however many years it's been since episode 2.
HalfLife,3bncu0,CoffeeWaffee,3,Tue Jun 30 23:39:43 2015 UTC,"there is only so much content a linear shooter can have before it becomes bloated. so i don't think its a matter of half life 3 being so large its taking forever to finish it, rather its probably taking so long because they have so many ideas and such a small game to implement them in.   because they cant do everything they want they are probably trying to really refine it, and have probably started over from scratch several times now as valve is known to do."

I'm not saying that Valve shouldn't be paid, but they ought to show way more respect to their fans who are essentially fixing their problems free of charge, rather than giving everyone the ""We're way too hip to talk to the likes of you"" cold shoulder, or ""Hey, you want to put your fixes on Steam?

Maybe, since Xen is an alternate dimension in addition to a border world, perhaps - since the G-Man seems to be omnipotent and shows that he is able to manipulate time and space - this is what Gordon experiences in Stasis.   What if it was that Gordon had accepted the G-Man's offer, so a battle in what we'd call the past (but time is irrelevant in an alternate dimension) took place over those 20 Earth years, including the 7-hour war - thus ending the slavery of the Vortigaunts and allowing them to assist the humans against the Combine. From Gordon's perspective, it seemed he was in Xen in real time; but that was Gordon's test of employment and the G-Man's next ""immediate"" assignment for him was liberation of the humans 20 Earth years later?"
HalfLife,3bgjmx,briggswag,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:01:56 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, this is completely wrong after the chapter Entanglement. Once you and Alyx teleport out of Nova Prospekt you are greeted by Kleiner, who tells you the teleport lagged by around a week. During the moment of you teleporting out of Nova Prospekt and into Kleiner's lab, there was also enough time for the uprising to start. Don't be fooled, just because the map prefixes only go up to d3 (day 3), it doesn't mean actually HL2 took that long."
HalfLife,3bgjmx,LOCKJAWVENOM,2,Tue Jun 30 05:48:51 2015 UTC,"But this is assuming the teleportation was instant for Gordon, which Alyx's dialogue pretty much confirms it was instant for them. Its not how long did HL2 take, its how many days was Freeman's journey in his eyes"
HalfLife,3bgjmx,fpiceail,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:02:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understood what I said. The teleportation APPEARED to be instant, that's true, but Kleiner tells you it ACTUALLY took around a week. He even refers to it as a ""slow teleport"". Also, just because Gordon doesn't realize immediately that the teleport took that that long doesn't mean it was still instant from his perspective once he was told it wasn't. If you go to sleep, you don't see time pass, but your perspective still adjusts to the understanding that time DID pass."

It was like somewhere in 2009... But If you think about you can almost tell it is Breen, when you hear how they talk about them... And he was the old administrator of sector-C..."

Alyxs says something like, don't get my father started about docter Breen. I dunno. That is actually the only piece of information you get in Half-Life 2 that they hate him..  I think they hate him because he made deals with the combine. Even he says it in his tower at the end of the game"
HalfLife,3beztt,ZeekySantos,16,Sun Jun 28 20:34:50 2015 UTC,"That is actually the only piece of information you get in Half-Life 2 that they hate him..

Moreover, you don't really need a lot of direct references to Breen himself, they're part of the resistance fighting against the combine, and Breen works for the Combine, the animosity is clear enough."
HalfLife,3beztt,BirdCat666,4,Sun Jun 28 21:07:48 2015 UTC,I was trying to say that. I see I made a mistake saying that that is the only piece of information. I played that game over and over and over again.

HalfLife,3be6j2,GirvoGiovanni,22,Sun Jun 28 11:24:29 2015 UTC,"Valve has a knack for building unfathomably sprawling superstructures.  Whether it's Black Mesa, White Forest, City 17 or Aperture - you spend hours travelling through them and know that you probably only saw half of it, at best.  I think it's kind of cool because you could tell many adventures within the same space and no one would really question it.  It's just takes place in another part of the building.  BMRF was supposedly built around and on top of old government structures, presumably from the 1950s (the Office Complex texture names refer to the 1950s).  Money flowed quite freely from the federal government at that time, which is why so much of the nation's infrastructure was built then.  But two things come to mind.  One, these facilities really were hastily built and don't really stand the test of time.  And two, you get the sense that BM cut corners left and right.  While the ""public facing"" labs are posh and shiny, areas like those in Office Complex and Apprehension show that it's a lot less glamorous beneath the surface."
HalfLife,3be6j2,Riomaki,7,Sun Jun 28 15:21:38 2015 UTC,"wait, was white forest that big? been a while since i played, i thought it was reasonably sized for a military base/missile silo. i mean it was probably larger then the real world equivalent but it wasn't anything like black mesa or aperture."
HalfLife,3be6j2,Max_Valentino,2,Mon Jun 29 03:57:41 2015 UTC,I think White Forest was about the size of a typical soviet era missile silo or missile silo complex.
HalfLife,3be6j2,billywob,4,Thu Jul 2 21:45:24 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. There's a big transition from the dirty mechanics of the place to the shiny labs.   I think I noticed the size when you down a massive elevator, then down another long freight elevator, then down again, just to get the the Lambda labs. Then, the enormous size and depth of the reactor. It's almost unfathomable."
HalfLife,3be6j2,Wawawawaluigi,6,Mon Jun 29 12:12:03 2015 UTC,"I'd say around several hundred billion dollars. Black Mesa is absolutely massive. From Freeman's perspective, it takes about 2 days to go from one end of the facility (Sector C) to the other (Lambda Facility). Not to mention the absolutely massive structures in Black Mesa, such as parts of the Transit System and the Biodome Complex. Black Mesa is also full of extremely experimental technology, like the Antimass Spectrometer and teleportation devices in general. It's a shame that all had to go to waste during the Resonance Cascade."
HalfLife,3be6j2,Teksand,2,Sun Jun 28 21:08:03 2015 UTC,"To be fair though, Gordon spent most of his time fighting off aggressive forces and being forced to take roundabout routes to get to the other side of the base, such as traveling through the desert and along a cliff face.  He was also knocked unconscious for a period of time.   It wasn't like he took 2 entire days to walk through a few hallways."
HalfLife,3be6j2,Brunoob,2,Wed Jul 1 17:00:27 2015 UTC,"I played OpFor recently and that just tells you how immense Black Mesa is. Must have costed around 15 digits, it's just so huge and researches go in so many different directions (weapons, aliens, missiles, teleports). Too bad everything blew up, thanks g-man"
HalfLife,3be6j2,billywob,2,Wed Jul 1 06:43:08 2015 UTC,"BMRF was supposed to have been built around decommissioned missile silos, which are built to withstand a substantial attack. I don't think that a nuke which fit in the back of a truck would have entirely destroyed the facility."

HalfLife,3be6j2,billywob,2,Fri Jul 3 13:35:18 2015 UTC,"How much did it cost to construct CERN? About how much did it cost to build Area 51? I'm thinking the cost of BMRF would be about the same as those two put together. BMRF is large, I'm guessing about the size of a large military base. And it also has a large amount of highly specialized scientific equipment."
HalfLife,3be6j2,kingkolton9,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:43:32 2015 UTC,"kilometre deep   This is never mentioned in game, nor even hinted at. The nuclear reactor we see is underground, but that's about it.  People mention that it takes a while to get through. This is false, provided you think of Black Mesa under non-post resonance cascade conditions.  You're constantly stopping to fight enemies, running around solving small and large puzzles, and trying to find the only unlocked exit. This results in grandiose travel paths. Half the time, if Freeman could have opened a door, he could have saved himself 30 minutes or more. Think about the biodome complex and how scanner access would have affected that. Or, if the lambda complex hadn't shut its doors. There's a few doors that are explicitly marked, but there are more that could've been entrances.  Let's take a look at this theory, then. If everything is working, (bar the tram, for argument's sake, of course). I went through these one by one with god, notarget, and noclip, but only to get through locked doors, cross bridges that would normally be there, and pits and radioactive stuff that wouldn't. Noclip was bound to a key and these were timed.  Office complex: 1:27  We've got hostiles: Cut (0:00)  Blast Pit: 2:40  Power Up: Cut (0:00)  On a Rail: 4:20  Apprehension: 2:36  Residue Processing: 3:40  Questionable Ethics: 0:45  Surface Tension: 7:11, but can be 25 seconds if you enter the secure access door.  Forget About Freeman: 2:30, although it would only be 20 seconds if the Lamdba Complex door at the beginning was open  Lambda Core: 6:35  Starting from Office Complex, the total time it would have taken him is 31 minutes and 44 seconds, or 29:34 if Forget About Freeman was mostly skipped. And, if most of Surface Tension was skipped (See below), that number would be 19:53. 20 minutes.  Right at the start of Surface Tension, there's a giant secure access door. Now, the lambda complex supposedly has a bunch of entrances because it's huge. We can guess it's one of them, because in Forget About Freeman, as you come to the surface, there's a door marked ""Secure Access"" and the building its in looks like the one from Surface Tension. Not to mention that we hear shelling.  If it happens to be so, that means surface tension and forget about Freeman are cut.  Lambda core is only so long because freeman is running around trying to start up the reactor and teleporting around...Because there's a bunch of closed doors.   We can cut out so much.  You know one of the reasons speedrunners get through so quickly? They don't fight enemies.  Don't get me wrong: Black Mesa is huge, but not as big as everyone thinks."
HalfLife,3be6j2,Max_Valentino,3,Mon Jun 29 02:33:16 2015 UTC,"i don't know man, maybe Gordon specific trip would have been much shorter because he could take direct routs, but that doesn't account for the facility as a whole as OP meant it. i mean there are literally chasms you cant see the bottom of lol many missile silos and giant ass rooms.   i bet of you add up the volume of every indoor map from every level of half life, opposing force, and blue shift it would be a staggering amount, and that's a debatable fraction of the size of the full facility."

HalfLife,3be6j2,kingkolton9,-1,Mon Jun 29 04:32:31 2015 UTC,"there's like three in the opening sequence alone   Mostly from lack of lighting   there is the one with the crates   Leads literally 50 feet down   there is the one with the fan   Not that far down   there is the one with the generator that turns on the blast pit   That's not bottomless   there is the one with the little brige that gets destroyed after a bull squid teleports on top of it   That's like 25 feet deep   there is a lot man lol   And none of them are as deep as you think, lol   and yes they are that hard and expensive to make when they are carved into a mountain.   Maybe when in the side of a mountain, but it's a good thing almost all of Black Mesa is built into a...I don't know, Mesa. The only part of it on the side is a bunch of waste pipes. AKA: Not intended for Humans and cheap to put up.   once again its not about traverse speed, its about overall size.    Once again: Size is correlated to traverse speed, and doors really reduce this.   i could traverse from my back door to my front door in a few seconds but that's not nearly my full house when you consider all the rooms i didn't touch and walked passed, the basement the upstairs the attic etc.   Right. However, your house isn't all that big. You could easily run through every room in under 2 minutes. the only reason it would take so long is going through doorways and up stairs."

You've just confirmed you don't understand what you're talking about. It's not ""programming limitations,"" and as far as goldSRC is concerned, one side of a worldbrush is equal to one side of another, no matter how big or small. At least, if it's the same shape. Don't fret, I thought the same thing as you. Almost everyone does.   alright fine, when they are carved into a mesa. point is that its inside solid rock that had to be carved out   Just like ground literally anywhere?    buildings that were constructed on the surface making it much harder and expensive which is what op was getting at. i dont see what your point is.   All buildings have foundations. They wouldn't be able to stay up too long otherwise. It's not ""harder and expensive"" (Expensive, at least, in the context of construction.) The equipment FAR, FAR outweighs the price of the materials and construction.   and how is size correlated to traverse speed?   Really? The bigger something is, the slower traverse speed is.    if the quickest rout completely ignores entire areas of the facility    Gordon certainly doesn't take the quickest route. It's so damn convoluted.   if the quickest rout completely ignores entire areas of the facility then how could the speed of that rout possibly correlate to the overall size of this place?   If you go the quickest route, you're bypassing much of the size, therefore have a faster traverse speed. Think about it this way: Black Mesa wasn't built in a line. Pretty much every segment has multiple entries and exits.  Black Mesa is nowhere near the size you think it is, but it is a very large complex. Gordon's route could have been made even faster--- There's trams, cars, railways, elevators, teleporters, vents, doors, etc that he didn't use or have access to. Take, for example, the one on Surface Tension that cuts out a bunch of time. On a normal day, he wouldn't have even had to go the routes he did. Especially if a department head or administrator sent him. He could have walked the path and made it there in a comfortable amount of time.    once again we aren't talking about distance from Anomalous Materials to Lambda Complex, we are talking about the size of everything in the facility   k. It's still not as big as you think. Blueshift would be like 10 minutes long and Opposing Force would be a hell of a lot shorter, too. You aren't understanding how much fighting slows you down.   that means every room and hallway that could otherwise be ignored.   Doesn't change a single thing.    not to mention all the infrastructure we don't see, and all the areas from opposing force and blue shift.   k."

HalfLife,3bbmdg,desimaldevil,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:51:41 2015 UTC,"Guys, I'm new to the sub and have not really followed the HL series for years, but...  Why exactly everyone, from the filthy casuals like me to the die hard Half Life fans are waiting for, hoping for Half Life 3, when we still don't know much about HL2 Episode 3?  I remember asking the same question like half a decade ago, and some guy replying something about cancellation rings a bell, but I fail to find anything on this matter right now. Yes, there are some pages claiming that Episode 3 was cancelled, but I'm not sure how authentic that is, given that some sites claimed this in May 2010, others did it in 2011, so it does not really make sense.  Not trying to be smart, it's just that it has been bugging me for a while."
HalfLife,3bdva9,BleachedJoy,19,Sun Jun 28 07:55:08 2015 UTC,"The fact that the pick-up icons are always cut-off in Ep. 2. ""Verify integrity of game cache"" won't fix it; I believe it's been broken for some time.  Other than that, I'm slightly annoyed that HL3 isn't coming sooner."
HalfLife,3bdva9,woodshop20,8,Sun Jun 28 09:51:13 2015 UTC,I thought I was the only one!
HalfLife,3bdva9,Lightningstar95,6,Sun Jun 28 11:37:42 2015 UTC,"Yes!  As far as I can remember, they've always been cut-off for me."

HalfLife,3bdva9,Pain_Fly,18,Sun Jun 28 20:49:31 2015 UTC,"The squad system. Valve decided the apartments at the end of the game weren't tight enough, so they gave you five rebels to trip over and scream at any time a grenade came rolling your way."
HalfLife,3bdva9,Riomaki,9,Sun Jun 28 14:09:13 2015 UTC,"The Antlions work way better as allies.  Not only are they pound-for-pound more deadly, but they can fly out of the way.  And if worse comes to worse, you can just shoot them.  It's a shame they never revisited that mechanic again.  Because, yeah, the rebel squads are absolutely terrible.  Even if you humor the mechanic and use C to send them away, they'll ping-pong right back into your face after a few seconds."
HalfLife,3bdva9,Pain_Fly,6,Sun Jun 28 15:29:46 2015 UTC,You're assuming I'm not using C to send them all off to their deaths...
HalfLife,3bdva9,Riomaki,4,Sun Jun 28 18:13:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  Although it's not like friendly squads worked especially well in HL1 either, at least if you told them to stay put, they'd stay put.  They left it entirely up to the player if they wanted the help or not, whereas in HL2, it's forced upon you."
HalfLife,3bdva9,kwertyuiop,7,Sun Jun 28 18:28:56 2015 UTC,Except the scientists and guards in HL1 found themselves unable to maneuver around the treacherous waist high windows of Black Mesa and stopped following your path to safety so they wouldn't have to go more than 20 feet from where you found them.

HalfLife,3bdva9,TheJonesReddit,20,Sun Jun 28 23:30:16 2015 UTC,People using a shotgun to destroy boxes. You have a freaking crowbar.
HalfLife,3bdva9,RyanHarms00,9,Sun Jun 28 07:59:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's pretty big. Unless it's a speedrun there's no need to waste ammo for more ammo. I forget if it's the first or second, but it takes like 4 shells to break open a crate."
HalfLife,3bdva9,Vrabo,4,Sun Jun 28 08:33:44 2015 UTC,You can break open multiple crates with one shell.
HalfLife,3bdva9,5225225,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:22:45 2015 UTC,Or the pistol...
HalfLife,3bdva9,Riomaki,-4,Mon Jun 29 14:56:57 2015 UTC,"Not always. The grav gun isn't very good at opening crates, especially when you need to do it quickly."
HalfLife,3bdva9,A_Wild_Wurmple,4,Sun Jun 28 12:03:11 2015 UTC,"Really?  Press LMB and the item crate shatters.  I don't think it gets much simpler than that.  Also, at least you can press G to toggle over to the Gravity Gun and toggle back.  That's the quirk with the crowbar and why sometimes players get lazy and just shoot the crates instead - you don't have to equip it first and then go re-equip your previous weapon.  I find it comes up more often in user-made levels that, for whatever reason, don't provide the Gravity Gun.  When you get to the point where you have multiple weapons tied to a single number key, switching over to the Crowbar and back is a bit of a chore.  In HL2 itself, I believe you get the Gravity Gun before that point, so the problem never comes up."
HalfLife,3bdva9,5225225,2,Sun Jun 28 18:34:56 2015 UTC,Can't you hit Q to switch to your previous weapon?
HalfLife,3bdva9,Danisnotonavan,-1,Sun Jun 28 18:41:00 2015 UTC,"I've tried it ingame.  It sometimes takes 3+ tries to get it to actually shatter. Which, when you're trying to fight, is way too long (plus the items tend to spread out, so you have to go run collect them). Plus, often I'm doing it for health/armour. I'd rather get +50 HP and waste a few shells than die."
HalfLife,3bdva9,PurpleFlurp16,8,Sun Jun 28 22:19:56 2015 UTC,"On my 1600x900 pixel monitor, the top of the '6' on ammo or health is 4 pixels wide when I feel it should be 6."

HalfLife,3bdva9,B-24J-Liberator,8,Mon Jun 29 21:38:11 2015 UTC,"It makes me angry when I see how HL slowly sinks in the quicksand of time :( I'm a teenager and whenever I talk with others about our favourite games, usually no one has played one of the HL games. In real life, I only know one person who has ever touched the series, and that was when he was a kid and his parents showed it to him.   Oh, and I can't stand when people say they dislike HL2 because ""gunplay is crap"", ""graphics aren't that good anymore"" or ""all of HL's technical achievements have been improved in later games"". If you only care about graphics, combat and the tech, better don't play a singleplayer game. Especially Half-Life would only bother you with atmosphere, plot and characters."
HalfLife,3bdva9,PurpleFlurp16,6,Mon Jun 29 21:22:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, the ""Seinfeld isn't funny"" effect is both a blessing and a curse for things like Half Life. Revolutionary and scope-shaping in their prime time, everyone eventually copies their success with their own spin on it and makes tiny personal improvements, leading to the original being ""generic"" and ""uninteresting""."
HalfLife,3bdva9,OttoTheAndalusian,4,Tue Jun 30 00:06:21 2015 UTC,"While I agree, it sucks to see only a handful of people play Half-Life, I see it as a way to spread the word and encourage others to try it. I've managed to get quite a few of my friends to play the series and pretty much all of them love it now."
HalfLife,3bdva9,Brunoob,2,Mon Jun 29 21:43:18 2015 UTC,"Congrats, I never accomplished that. Whenever I say something like ""What, you don't know Half-Life? You really have to play it, it's awesome"", they are like ""Haha, yeah, will do"" and off they go, never thinking about HL again. xD"

Their body physics are such that once a headcrab has jumped, they will continue to maintain the same relative distance even if you backpedal to dodge. The result is that in order to successfully dodge you must use a combination of backpedaling and strafing.  Also how HL2+Episodes hold your hand when it comes to the snarkiness from Barney and the Vorts, and the shoehorning of your relationship with Alyx. As opposed to the ""left for dead"" atmosphere of HL1."

HalfLife,3bdva9,Deramor,4,Mon Jun 29 13:50:51 2015 UTC,The squad system in HL2. They come back to you a few seconds after you send them off. Do you have any idea how hard that makes a playthrough where you're not allowed to have any friendly NPC's die unless it's scripted/impossible without cheats? You know when you come from a ruined building next to the Nexus onto a courtyard full of Striders? I had to barricade my squad in the building with a dumpster. It's not easy trying to get that thing through the door without being able to pick it up.

HalfLife,3bdva9,kwertyuiop,3,Mon Jun 29 04:34:09 2015 UTC,"Seriously, in Half-Life the shotgun was great, but so was the revolver. Now they just trashed both of the guns, AND didn't give you the shotgun until chapter 5, whereas you get it in chapter 4 in Half-Life."
HalfLife,3bdva9,Brunoob,3,Mon Jun 29 15:58:08 2015 UTC,"People complaining about headcrabs being hard to hit.

HalfLife,3bc0hz,LOCKJAWVENOM,6,Sun Jun 28 03:18:57 2015 UTC,"I like to imagine it's because anti-aging techniques have advanced the avg life expectancy at that stage in the future, that's why Breen might look 60 in HL2 when he could really be more like 70-80 or even close to 90, or something like that."

I just payed Mass Effect 1 and 2, and I know there are a ton of canonical incompatibilities between the two stories, like how Commander Shepard has one of three pre-established back stories and also the entire story of the resonance cascade and the Combine invasion never happened to Earth in the ME universe, and also the spelling is wrong, but wouldn't it be funny if Gman takes Corporal Shephard out of stasis in 21whateveritis and drops him into the Alliance military, pulls some strings with the higher ups to get him all registered and everything, they misspell his name and he can never manage to correct it, he goes on to achieve the rank of Commander, save the galaxy, and have sex with aliens?

HalfLife,3b3d43,Riomaki,3,Fri Jun 26 02:20:06 2015 UTC,"It's very simple.  Ask someone about their favorite shooters and if ""Doom"" comes up, the inevitable follow-up is ""The new one or the old one?""  Hence we have to follow-up with ""Doom 4"" or ""Doom 2016"" or ""The New Doom.""  It's one thing if the original game was really obscure, but the original Doom was anything but.  It has held up amazingly well over the years and is still a perfectly valid talking point when it comes to shooters.  Calling the new game ""Doom"" is akin to Jurassic World being called ""Jurassic Park.""  When the original is such an influential piece of work, you have nothing to gain by using the same title.  You only cheapen the franchise - especially if the new product ends up being trash."

HalfLife,3b22sn,TheJonesReddit,32,Thu Jun 25 10:02:37 2015 UTC,"The speculation regarding CSGO is a complete BS. The absolutely worst thing Valve could make with csgo is to split the community where half the people would move to the new CS and the other half woud stay on CSGO. That's not going to happen. If they release something, they need to move the entire playerbase over and that means a replacement or an update. Not a new game."
HalfLife,3b22sn,JonnyRobbie,5,Thu Jun 25 14:06:46 2015 UTC,CSGO is apparently a Frankenstein's monster engine which has long since diverged from base Source.  I can't imagine them investing the time and effort to port it to Source 2.

HalfLife,3b0h58,GuyWithTooMuchTime,3,Sat Jun 27 05:54:02 2015 UTC,"Holy crap you guys are a-holes Edit: you people really need to learn what the downvote button is for. I am providing really constructive well sourced conversation here and I am getting downvoted to hell with little in the way of actual conversation.  Here's the timeline:   Combine invade vort/nihilanth homeworld. V/N retreat across several worlds, ultimately arriving at Xen where the combine defeat them. Combine enslave Vortigaunts, including Nihilanth, which is explicitly given by a line of diologue from Nihilanth (""Their slaves...we are their slaves...we are..."" http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Nihilanth). This enslavement is further shown by the shackles that the character models wear. The vortigaunts would not need to be enslaved if they were resistance fighters. If Nihilanth was the one who enslaved them, he would not be a slave himself. The modification of super soldiers and collection of native technology is exactly how the combine have operated everywhere. Based on Vortigaunt behavior and dialogue from HL2, the modification of super soldiers would be very out of character for vortigaunts, who tend to be somewhat hippyish. Just as on earth, the entire maintenance/management structure is composed of enslaved/modified natives, so the lack of direct combine presence would be expected.   These events EXACTLY mirror what happened with Breen/Earth. Humans defeated, a native from the planet brokers ""peace"" combine begin modifying humans/vortigaunts.  And to cut you off, there was no room nor raw materials on Xen to build a citadel. Small floating asteroid islands do not make good ground for such a large structure. Furthermore, the combine empire is presumably a rather expansive one and the vortigaunts were probably just a minor backwater distraction based on their apparent numbers. The full combine force was alerted to earth because of the size and significance of the resonance cascade."
HalfLife,3b0h58,patchkit,4,Fri Jul 3 04:20:56 2015 UTC,"The vortigaunts aren't slaves of the Combine in HL1, they're slaves of the Ninhilanth. And the whole reason Xen invaded earth is to find a world to escape from the Combine, which was their whole reason of going to Xen. The Combine had nothing to do with Xen during HL1."
HalfLife,3b0h58,GuyWithTooMuchTime,2,Sat Jun 27 21:49:10 2015 UTC,Why does Nihilanth say he is a slave?   the whole reason Xen invaded earth is to find a world to escape from the Combine   just like conquered humans who still try to escape?
HalfLife,3b0h58,patchkit,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:58:59 2015 UTC,"Well first of all, Nihilanth could be referring to anything when he says we are their slaves. Maybe he means the G-Man. And yeah, remember that time in Half-Life 2 Gordon Freeman left Earth to escape the Combine? Yeah, me neither."
HalfLife,3b0h58,GuyWithTooMuchTime,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:58:14 2015 UTC,"He could mean anything by ""We are their slaves""?    Right. That's a pretty short simple direct expository sentence. There is no additional context to give it some sort of deeper philosophical meaning like we are all slaves to time or something like that.   remember that time in Half-Life 2 Gordon Freeman left Earth to escape the Combine?   The point is that humanity was enslaved and fought back against the combine. Why would the vorts be any different?Humanity/Gman caused the resonance cascade and the vorts took advantage to try and escape. It's not like they planned some sort of invasion and attacked earth. They were enslaved so they were desperate to jump at the first escape opportunity they had.   If the combine didn't know about Xen, then it would have been much, much wiser to stay put rather than start an interdimensional war against an unknown adversary.  This is literary analysis. I am presenting known behaviors and dialogue from the game. Actual things that happen and exist. The only evidence that Xen wasn't already conquered by the combine is some forum posts of something Laidlaw reputedly said (of which I can find no other confirmation). Which is irrelevant anyway. In literary analysis, it doesn't matter what the author intended:   [Modern literary schools] share the tenet that the author's interpretation of a work is no more inherently meaningful than any other.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_theory  My outline makes a whole hell of a lot more sense in context of the dialogue, character models, and known behaviors."
HalfLife,3b0h58,dangertable,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:20:56 2015 UTC,"The ""We are their slaves."" line, in my opinion, is either there to just be intentionally cryptic and spook the player, or refer to the G-Man, because the Combine probably hadn't even been written yet. But, it's not really literary analysis, because Marc Laidlaw, the writer, said that it was canon that the Ninhilanth hadn't been captured by the Combine."
HalfLife,3b0h58,patchkit,2,Thu Jun 25 18:46:48 2015 UTC,"Combine enslave Vortigaunts, including Nihilanth   Apparently this isn't true according to the page you linked   Based on some of its speeches and what appear to be surgical scars and amputated legs similar the that of the Stalker's, it is thought the Nihilanth was once a slave to an obscure higher power which was later thought to be the Combine. This theory was dashed by Marc Laidlaw, who confirmed that the Nihilanth had never been captured by the Combine, though some other members of his species might have been."
HalfLife,3b0h58,helegad,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:11:40 2015 UTC,This claim is inconsistent with the dialogue and happenings in the game.   Nihilanth SAYS he is a slave. He has shackles similar to the vorts. The factory making super soldiers is consistent with combine behavior. The combine use the same shackles on the vorts in HL2.  Personally I'm going to trust what happens in the game over the source of that trivie (an unsourced forum post).

From this website: http://www.members.shaw.ca/halflifestory/timeline.htm[1]   The Combine attempt to hybridize the dominant species of the planet (In Xen's case, the Vortigaunts) with their own technology to create a ""Super soldier"" that is adapted to Xen's environment and uses powerful Combine technology. (This is what they attempt to do on Earth, as well). Nihilanth and his people fight bitterly against the Combine."
HalfLife,3b0h58,patchkit,9,Thu Jun 25 00:05:08 2015 UTC,"""Nihilanth and his people fight bitterly against the Combine.""  This contradicts your whole statement.  If this was a Combine move, why would the Nihilanth be using his own people and minions to make the Combine's super soldiers?  The Vortigaunts are controlled by the Alien Controllers, who are spawned by the Nihilanth. These Vortigaunts are making the super soldiers in a factory that doesn't even have any Combine Architecture in it (Using more rock type walls then hard steel walls."
HalfLife,3b0h58,Riomaki,11,Thu Jun 25 00:11:18 2015 UTC,But Laidlaw said that Nihilanth fled from the Combine and arrived at Xen. Nihilanth was part of a faction separate from the Combine.

HalfLife,3as3jv,CP_Officer,15,Tue Jun 23 22:14:34 2015 UTC,"I still think HL1 should rank above HL2. Especially now, after a few years, I feel like the first installment has aged better, has more lasting appeal than the second.  Don't get me wrong, Half-Life 2 was and is a fantastic game, and rightfully deserves a top spot in rankings such as these. But all in all, to me it feels like the story in 1 was executed better than in 2.  Also, after replaying both way too many times, the second tends to feel more and more like a slideshow. An endless stream of ""Look at how amazing our Source engine is! Look at the beautiful things we can do! We can even do see-saw puzzles everywhere!"". Meanwhile, the first has most of the sight-seeing at the beginning, and focuses mostly on action and progressing the narrative during the game itself.  This is of course my personal opinion, and I'm sure others will disagree. But for me no game, not even Half-Life 2, has ever been better than Half-Life."
HalfLife,3as3jv,TheCat5001,15,Tue Jun 23 11:26:11 2015 UTC,"Upvoted even though I disagree. The games are so completely different its tough to say which is better in absolute terms. It took me an hour or two to excuse hl1s graphics but once I did I found the atmosphere to be insanely compelling. Even so, hl2s scratched my itch more effectively. Hearing breens impassioned speeches, setting zombies on fire in ravenholm, the desolate silence of the canal - the complete dystopia hasn't been matched in other games, as far as I know. HL1 had that same sense of aloneness but in a subtly different setting that had slightly less appeal."
HalfLife,3as3jv,ryanman,2,Tue Jun 23 12:31:13 2015 UTC,You just expressed my thoughts more clearly than I was thinking them. Thank you!
HalfLife,3as3jv,MadTux,2,Tue Jun 23 20:35:36 2015 UTC,"So much about HL2 blew me away when it came about. The execution is damn near flawless and the innovation is extremely ambitious.  Still personally...I just enjoy the atmosphere/aura, mystery, and gameplay from HL1."
HalfLife,3as3jv,bujweiser,4,Tue Jun 23 19:47:58 2015 UTC,"I also upvoted even though I disagree.  but for different reasons.  I think HL1 was an amazing game, but I like many other gamers didn't play through HL1 when it was new.  I played it a little but I was a little young for it and didn't understand it or finish it.  I kind of then ignored HL until after 2 came out and that was the game that really captured my attention.  If I had been maybe 5 years older when HL1 came out, I might feel like you do.  I also don't think I am alone in this.  I think HL1 had far fewer people playing it and a ton of people went back to play HL1 after finishing HL2 and it is hard to go back and play an older game.  The graphics the physics (especially grenades) and the enemy AI are all quite outdated and although the gameplay, the puzzles, the bosses are excellent, it can be a hard game to play if you are used to newer games.  That is why HL2 will always rate higher than HL1, because so many more people played HL2 and loved it, than played HL1 when it was new and loved it."
HalfLife,3as3jv,elpedro84,3,Tue Jun 23 13:41:15 2015 UTC,"Huh, is Baldur's Gate 2 really that good?  I tried to play the first one, but I couldn't work with the old school DnD rules."

HalfLife,3as3jv,BySumbergsStache,3,Tue Jun 23 15:20:28 2015 UTC,"The second play through of bioshock was superior once you were used to it. The shooting mechanics were and still are fucking horrendous. That's why I liked infinite more, to be honest - having to self flagellate for atmosphere and story is a tough sell."
HalfLife,3as3jv,ryanman,2,Tue Jun 23 12:33:16 2015 UTC,"Except the problem with Infinite is that while the shooting is a lot better, it has to be because the game relies so heavily on it.  The game is nothing more than 15 hours of a linear procession of battle arenas where you kill everyone, loot the dead, wait for Elizabeth to unlock the door, and repeat."
HalfLife,3as3jv,Riomaki,2,Tue Jun 23 16:39:58 2015 UTC,"Bioshock may have had you running in an area more often rather than a line, but both of them had a story with cool setpieces. Really a game should be fun FIRST (imo) and then focus on the story. The shooting in Bioshock was more than not fun - it was inexcusably bad."
HalfLife,3as3jv,ryanman,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:14:36 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say the shooting was inexcusably bad.  The overall character movement, though, was very clunky and heavy.  At least BioShock 2 had an explanation for it, playing as a Big Daddy.  As for the first game - it's hilarious how Jack has the same weight and sluggish mobility despite being an ordinary man."
HalfLife,3as3jv,Riomaki,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:39:32 2015 UTC,"The movement added to it for sure but the sounds, hitboxes, and kinda-useless ammo type changes really hurt it just as much. While having limited ammo gave it a survival vibe what it ended up doing instead was making it so you never shot a damn thing since you couldn't even take on 3 splicers reliably.  Opinons are opinions and I still (really!) love the game - it's one of the best single player experiences I've had. But the shooting truly is the worst I've encountered in any AAA game I've played."
HalfLife,3as3jv,ryanman,2,Tue Jun 23 19:08:46 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to hear that someone else thinks that the shooting isn't good. It just seems like a burden. I have to agree on ammo also.   The hacking is annoying too, I don't think it adds to the game. However, I find the combat so horrendous that most of the time I look forward to hacking, because I can take a break from it."
HalfLife,3as3jv,BySumbergsStache,2,Tue Jun 23 19:54:50 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I think the shooting in BioShock is pretty mediocre.   I just don't think it falls to the level of being inexcusably bad, mostly because the rest of the game compensates for it.  It doesn't put you in too many giant arena battles, nor does it sic too many Splicers on you at once.  I think it was probably born from an ill-conceived, kludgey attempt to make the player use melee and Plasmids more often.  BioShock came out in 2006.  They had to have known what good gunplay looked like because Half-Life 2, UT2K4 and Doom 3 all existed.  Not to mention multiple iterations of Halo for console folks.  And yet, they insisted on the same clunky shooting mechanics from System Shock 2 and the movement of Gears of War (despite, again, being an ordinary man).  I just feel it was designed that way on purpose."
HalfLife,3as3jv,Riomaki,2,Thu Jun 25 00:54:47 2015 UTC,"I guess you're right. I can see how combat was done on purpose to make you use plasmids more. My strategy most of the time is to shock, then quickly change to a gun to kill.   Perhaps its just a victim of its own success, but I feel that the storyline of Bioshock is not that special and that a lot of media have similar storylines. I've read Atlas Shrugged so I chuckle at all of the references, but it's not enough. I don't really find the mechanics of plasmids very fleshed out either, I'm still not really certain how ADAM and EVE work together or how the vending machines allow you to do stuff. Also the art style is more Victorian era steampunk than 30s and 40s art deco. In any case, Rapture is supposed to have been constructed in 1946. By that time the modern machine age style should have come. Rapture looks old fashioned by comparison. Also, why are all the vending machines circus themed? It was charming at first but now I dread to listen to that music. I do not what to hear the phrase circus of value once more, once ever.   Perhaps I'm a little too harsh, but I've played the game for a good 6 hours, which should be enough to properly gage a game. Throughout this time, I've found myself dragging myself through the game like a chore, in order to reward myself with a (in my opinion) mediocre storyline. I like the story, honestly I find it really fun reading about the game on the wiki. Perhaps even more so than playing it. I'm still not sure how it beats out so many games in the best of all time.   thoughts?"
HalfLife,3as3jv,BySumbergsStache,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:48:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, how you moved was a big problem with me. Jack is a very fit, able man. Why is he so slow and unable to move?"
HalfLife,3as3jv,BySumbergsStache,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:55:22 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. At this point I'd rather just watch a let's play of the whole series, it seems more fun to me than having to go through the combat experience. I love the story."
HalfLife,3as3jv,BySumbergsStache,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:56:40 2015 UTC,"Ok I think that's why. I still don't really like shooting during in this game.

HalfLife,3as3jv,BySumbergsStache,3,Tue Jun 23 15:23:14 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way. I played Bioshock back when I had Gamefly. I got bored and gave up about 75% of the way through the game, according to my friend who platinum'd it.  I just... didn't care."

I just can't.  It would have been in the same highlight reel, but it wouldn't have dominated the show.  The fact is, although most gamers (outside of this subreddit) remember Half-Life 2 fondly, they are also well past it.  It's been ten years and a lot of games have arisen to fill that void left by Half-Life 3.  Maybe they aren't as good, maybe they aren't the total package, but they exist, which is more than anyone can say about Half-Life 3.

Will Half Life 3 be extremely optimized? Will it require a high-end computer? Alternatively, I wonder what additional features they'd add so it's not simply just a singleplayer-only game. Any multiplayer? Any alternate co-operative campaign?  I don't think I care about the surprise as I think we've been kept in the dark for eight years now since Episode 2. I'd rather they just tell us that they're not working on it, or they are so that we can actually have good reason to be hyped."
HalfLife,3aqtl3,Securitae,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:47:23 2015 UTC,"Maps will be, however, the underlying code will not. Valve stated that they want to optimize for everyone rather than one OS in particular. That is to say, they don't want another case of porting HL2 to Linux and OSX.   What? That doesn't imply less codebase optimization at all. Speaking as a programmer, optimization isn't usually OS-specific..."
HalfLife,3aqtl3,Causeless,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:30:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, it can have indirect effect. However, I'd like to remind you also that the Linux port of Source runs significantly faster than the native Windows version, even despite about 8 years advantage of Windows-specific optimizations before the port occurred.  The point is, usually you don't need to write OS-specific code for optimization. The underlying performance of the OS and their drivers is more important (although not as important as general optimizations)."
HalfLife,3aqtl3,Causeless,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:03:15 2015 UTC,"Source is a huge damn project. You're going to need to write OS specific optimizations.   Yeah, probably. That doesn't mean that OS specific optimizations are what is giving most of the speed boost - and that certainly doesn't mean that Source 2 won't have any codebase optimization...  Again, speaking as a programmer who's written his own simple game engine, and read books on game engine design, I can assure you that most optimizations are general, and about choosing different algorithms or data structures.   OS-specific optimizations aren't just rare, but also less likely to give a significant performance boost."

Of course you wouldn't have had to do a lot of cross-platform optimization. I'd bet money that the Havok physics code is miles beyond what your ""simple"" engine is doing and is miles complex more than your engine.   Of course Havok is miles ahead. It's made by a huge team of mathematicians and elite programmers.  The point is, I clearly know more than you. You have no idea what you are talking about. I have enough experience to talk about it.

It was pretty anticlimactic though. It was some sort of an E3 presentation that focused on all of Valve's games, mainly DOTA2 since it's their biggest right now. It was showing games running on Source 2, sort of as a compilation of trailers. A lot for DOTA2 since it was worked on the most, and then at the end a small teaser for Half-Life 3. No theatrics or anything.   That's not how I'd announce it nor how I think it will be... just sharing my dream haha"

HalfLife,3ap43u,kingo86,29,Mon Jun 22 10:29:35 2015 UTC,"At the end of Half-Life 1, you are given the option to oppose the G-Man by ignoring his instruction to step into the portal, and you soon find out that if you don't do what he says, he does get you killed without mercy. So although in HL2 we assume that you took his offer, you still KNOW that you had no choice, that it was technically a death threat from him. Which means the ""G"" does not stand for ""Good"".  Then at the start of EP1 vortiguants help you to break away from the G-Man which results in tensions between you and him. Yes you had no ""choice"" here but it's probably in your interest, and the vorts are definitely your friends, since they save Alyx and help you in many ways. So this could be considered an opposition. In EP2 it's obvious that the G-Man is against you due to the events of EP1, he tells you so and gets Eli killed. So he's very powerful and definitely has become Gordon's enemy. I can see the official ending of the Half-Life series being Gordon defeating the G-Man, but of course I hope the franchise never ends."
HalfLife,3ap43u,higgs8,10,Mon Jun 22 12:08:15 2015 UTC,"The ending ""choice"" of the original Half-Life was not a choice at all. It was merely an illusion of free choice, a recurring theme in the series. The writer, Marc Laidlaw, has stated that there was always one inevitable outcome. The G-Man's proposition was ultimately meaningless as Gordon had already proven his worth. He would work for the G-Man no matter what option he took.  Laidlaw's words may be found in this thread under ""The Choice in Half-Life 1""."
HalfLife,3ap43u,SlappyCromwell,4,Mon Jun 22 12:39:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think the G-Man really gives instructions. He just kind of lets you go to do what you're going to do. I think that's the point of the dynamic between Gordon and him, the illusion of free will. You think your doing the right thing by killing the Nihilanth and liberating City 17 only to realize later that you're doing exactly what he wants. Almost as if he knows the decisions you are going to make before you make them."
HalfLife,3ap43u,Its_Always_420,3,Mon Jun 22 18:37:41 2015 UTC,"Plot twist - Gordon is the G-Man. Because, you know, G for Gordon. Gordon Man? Gordon Freeman?"
HalfLife,3ap43u,Wafflecopter77,5,Wed Jun 24 04:30:57 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's why at the end of HL2 he says, ""Rather than offer you the illusion of free choice, I will take the liberty of choosing for you"""
HalfLife,3ap43u,MashMango,7,Mon Jun 22 18:52:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think Gordon has ever intentionally disobeyed the Gman.  Only in Half-Life 1 were we given a true choice - but Marc himself said that this too was an illusion.  Breaking free of his grasp in Episode 1 was the Vortigaunt's doing.  The subject of Gordon's contract is really intriguing. I want to know what the deal is. Who is the highest bidder now that Breen is out of the picture? I think it's the key to the entire arc. If we understand his contract and the bidders, we will be able to figure out what the deal is. I just don't think we have enough information to go on. We have to make assumptions based on what we have."
HalfLife,3ap43u,Empty_Allocution,4,Mon Jun 22 13:11:10 2015 UTC,Start of episode 2 maybe
HalfLife,3ap43u,AMajali,5,Mon Jun 22 10:34:34 2015 UTC,In what way?  So far I can only see Gordon is able to hide from GMan through the Vortigaunts' presence. But it doesn't quite seem like he intends to hide from him.
HalfLife,3ap43u,DuIstalri,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:58:50 2015 UTC,"Fighting for the Resistance after his 'contract' expired, rather then trying to get back in touch with the G-Man probably counts as defiance from the G-Man's perspective."

HalfLife,3ap43u,DuIstalri,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:33:25 2015 UTC,"It expired at the end of Half-Life 2, when he destroyed Breen's reactor at the top of the Citadel. That's why the G-Man put him back in stasis."

That's why the G-Man put him back in stasis.   Uhh, if he's still an employee of Gman (in stasis), then his contract is still in effect. Especially considering Gman wakes him up at the start of Episode 1."
HalfLife,3ap43u,DuIstalri,2,Mon Jun 22 23:14:10 2015 UTC,"No; the contract is him being hired to fight for the Resistance, not being an employee of the G-Man. Hence the whole thing from Breen ""Your contract is up for the highest bidder."" He's saying that he could hire Gordon off of the G-Man, instead of him fighting for the Resistance.  Remember how amazed Eli was that Gordon was still around in the beginning of Episode 1? Considering he already knew Alyx survived being at ground zero, he had no reason to expect that Gordon had died as well. He thought Gordon had been taken back by the G-Man."
HalfLife,3ap43u,kingkolton9,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:17:23 2015 UTC,"False false false false and false.  He is Gman's employee. He is hired at the end of HL1. You cannot argue against this.   Hence the whole thing from Breen ""Your contract is up for the highest bidder.   Gman licenses him off. It's like being a contractor. You work for one place who sends you out to the places that pay the most.   Remember how amazed Eli was that Gordon was still around in the beginning of Episode 1?   Huh? It's because a large part of the damn Citadel exploded.   Considering he already knew Alyx survived being at ground zero   He didn't.   He thought Gordon had been taken back by the G-Man.   No."

G-Man contracts him out. The contract with the Resistance/Vortigaunts expired, so he gets put back into storage.   He didn't.   Yeah he did. He'd been in contact with Alyx before Dog digs Gordon out of the rubble, and was completely shocked that Alyx actually managed to find him.  ""You found Gordon!?

HalfLife,3ap43u,kingkolton9,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:18:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing against this. G-Man contracts him out.   Therefore he is Gman's employee. Being contracted out by Company X for Company M doesn't make me an employee of Company M.   The contract with the Resistance/Vortigaunts expired, so he gets put back into storage.   No, his use for the day was over. He's put back in storage for literally the next day.   Yeah he did.   I repeat: He didn't.   He'd been in contact with Alyx before Dog digs Gordon out of the rubble, and was completely shocked that Alyx actually managed to find him.   Nope.   ""You found Gordon!?

HalfLife,3ap43u,chibinchobin,2,Tue Jun 23 01:24:48 2015 UTC,"Not by his own volition, no. That's the point.

All you have is the tv and a few books that you can't even read anymore. A nurse wheels in a tray with the squeaky wheel that used to drive you mad. Now you don't even care. Your mashed puree and milk is placed quietly in front of you and you give a small cough. You don't even bother to look up anymore. You reach slowly for a spoon and hesitate. The effort is exhausting. Your mind wanders and you think about your son and your daughter. You fight the urge to cry. Eventually your hand comes down on the spoon but you tilt your head in confusion because three silver spoons lay on your tray. You are finally losing your mind. You close your eyes and as you open them you realise the nurse is still standing there. You stare curiously into her face and you cannot comprehend her expression. What is Tina doing? You look back down at the three spoons on your tray and realise; HL3 CONFIRMED.  You're going to hang on just a little bit longer.

HalfLife,3an89y,BlackNut,14,Sun Jun 21 21:52:25 2015 UTC,I like him. The mystery is entertaining and has been the subject of many debates.
HalfLife,3an89y,redditorandwife,13,Sun Jun 21 22:03:23 2015 UTC,"We can't really say much about the G-Man without knowing what his true motivations are or who he works for.  As it stands though, his actions, directly or indirectly, led to the Resonance Cascade, the Combine invasion, and the deaths of likely millions of people in the process.  I'd say it'd take a heck of a reason for him to be considered a good guy, but we don't know what the alternative was."
HalfLife,3an89y,Riomaki,3,Sun Jun 21 22:22:35 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that he caused the cascade to lure the Combine to Earth, so that we could eventually defeat them. I mean, I thought the G-Man's employers and the Combine weren't friends, and the G-Man saw Gordon as someone who could destroy them (which he's been pretty good at so far).  Sure, he caused the deaths of millions on Earth, but he seems to be the ""Ends justify the means"" kind of guy. Killing millions of humans to him is worth the inevitable destruction of the combine empire and saving of who knows how many.  Or he could just be a sadistic individual and I'm speaking out of ignorance"
HalfLife,3an89y,washout77,2,Mon Jun 22 02:58:27 2015 UTC,"But even if Earth defeats the Combine, it will only be on Earth. Nothing we've seen implies that Gordon will ever manage to truly hurt the Combine, only drive them off of Earth."
HalfLife,3an89y,DuIstalri,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:45:30 2015 UTC,"I thought the G-Man's employers and the Combine weren't friends   I think that's true, given Breen's speech at the end about how Gordon's contract was open to the highest bidder.  The thought had apparently occurred to the Combine to buy him away from whoever currently employs him."
HalfLife,3an89y,Riomaki,2,Mon Jun 22 15:53:58 2015 UTC,How did he cause the combine invasion?
HalfLife,3an89y,strike__anywhere,6,Sun Jun 21 22:43:38 2015 UTC,"Well because he put all the pieces in place to begin with u can say that he did cause the invasion. Hes working for someone or some organization, it would be crazy if he was doing it all for his own sick entertainment."
HalfLife,3an89y,ImperiumOfMankind,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:21:25 2015 UTC,Im sorry but I still dont understand how he caused the invasion.
HalfLife,3an89y,Riomaki,10,Sun Jun 21 23:23:01 2015 UTC,"He caused the Resonance Cascade, which led to the invasion right afterwards. It wasn't like he clicked a button saying ""invade earth lel"" but if he had not caused the Cascade, there wouldn't have been an invasion."
HalfLife,3an89y,kyller3030,6,Sun Jun 21 23:27:49 2015 UTC,"Pretty much.  Again, not knowing the alternative, all we know is he set in motion the events which led to the Combine invasion.  And at no point does it seem like an accident (or an unforeseen consequence).  Unless the G-Man's employers are supremely incompetent, they probably foresaw the invasion.  Now, if the G-Man was supposed to be a good guy, one might suppose that a far worse fate awaited us if this didn't happen.  But again, who knows?  The twisted thing about the G-Man is that we simply don't know.  And because Gordon is essentially his pawn, we could say the same thing about our own motivations.  We are basically taking this person at his word because we don't have a choice.  And we know from BioShock how that can be problematic..."
HalfLife,3an89y,futurestorms,3,Sun Jun 21 23:49:58 2015 UTC,"and let's not forget his conspiracy with the BM administrator, dr Breen"
HalfLife,3an89y,teuast,4,Mon Jun 22 01:01:20 2015 UTC,"I think he could be both good and bad...depending on the price.   But a part of me thinks he's really Gordon Freeman, stuck in a time loop. Having to live this scenario over and over.   He grows older and wiser. Each time we play ou his scenario, we are his test subjects, unwittingly trying to help him get free of this mortal crux he's been bound to."
HalfLife,3an89y,Empty_Allocution,4,Mon Jun 22 02:25:01 2015 UTC,"Gman is a mystery. We don't know if he's good, bad, somewhere in between, or in yet another moral direction altogether. Me? I think he has a far broader goal than anything we've seen so far, the kind of thing that would make even the Combine seem like small potatoes, and so if we were to try to qualify him as ""good"" or ""bad"" or whatever is seeing it through to restrictive of a lens, a bit like playing Mass Effect 2 at 70 FOV because the fucking ini file doesn't show up in my stupid fucking directory where it's goddAMN SUPPOSED TO AND I DON'T KNOW WHOSE FAULT IT IS BUT I'M GONNA BLAME EA BECAUSE FUCK EA YOU FUCKING SHITS.

Now when I rescued Garrus (I knew that's who Archangel was going to turn out to be the moment someone mentioned he was a turian), it was more than a 10-second gunfight, and Garrus spent most of it making jokes about me being ugly. Which was especially amusing because I look like a goddamned movie star."
HalfLife,3an89y,AMajali,6,Tue Jun 23 10:52:43 2015 UTC,"Nihilanth knew better.   ""You are man. He is not man. For you he waits, for you.""  ""Deceive you... he will deceive you...""  I do not trust him. I want to throttle that puny little neck of his until he gives me all of the answers.  My theory is that he was previously a Shu'ulathoi (Combine) and when he hatched he took the form of a human and became an outcast of the Combine. He dislikes the Vortigaunts and that could work with that theory. The Vorts developed a language the Shu'ulathoi could not understand. If you read the Breengrub transcript, we learn that the Shu'ulathoi can adopt any form they wish after hatching. That could explain a lot of things. Perhaps both Gordon and Gman were Shu'ulathoi. Something along those lines would certainly explain their lack of speech skills."
HalfLife,3an89y,scriminamp,2,Mon Jun 22 06:55:57 2015 UTC,"Wow your theory is great,seriously..  Vortigaunts were shown to be able to destroy advisors so that's why can stop the G-man in episode 2 so I think that backs it up even more."

HalfLife,3an89y,HalfLife420,3,Mon Jun 22 00:37:29 2015 UTC,"Hard to say. He seems like he wants Gordon and the Resistance to win - after all, he did free Gordon from stasis to help the resistance, but from what we know, it doesn't seem like it's because he cares for the cause, more as if he does it simply because it either benefits him, or whoever he works for. But as somebody mentioned before me, we don't know his true motivations for what he does. He treats Gordon more as a test subject, or an employee, rather than an ally. I can't remember where I heard this term, but I think the best term for him would be an inter-dimensional bureaucrat, simply looking for suitable candidates for some unknown plot or project.  Or, you know, he's just a sadist."

It's not that I think it won't happen, I just think it's highly unlikely in comparison to DNF as DNF was designed by a company exclusively focused on games."
HalfLife,3akzr6,scrubben,4,Sun Jun 21 12:13:06 2015 UTC,"but dnf was a game that was no longer being made by the same developer and got handed off to several different studios before finally being released.. and its quality is kinda irrelevant to the case in point that people waited long for it yet it still released being a really GOOD example that half life 3 still has a chance, and seeing as it HAS NOT been hot potatoed across publishers and developers, it has a very high chance of being a quality release."
HalfLife,3akzr6,u83rmensch,45,Sun Jun 21 17:46:43 2015 UTC,"It's just the initial wave of bitterness that happens every year after Half-Life 3 fails to show up at E3. It'll subside within the next few days or so and we'll be back to our same old cautiously optimistic selves. After all, there is plenty of evidence that HL3 is, or at least was, in development. The JIRA leak, code leaks, the concept art... plus, Shenmue III was just announced a good fourteen years after its predecessor was released, so we have at least another six years to wait before giving up if HL3 is going to take that long. We've been waiting a long time, but think of it this way: Each day that passes is one day closer to the game of a lifetime."
HalfLife,3akzr6,JohnFreemanWhoWas,20,Sun Jun 21 06:10:31 2015 UTC,"My theory is just that Valve has been reworking the game since its inception. Every major Valve game has had some major redesign that pushed back releasing it, and HL3 seems no different."
HalfLife,3akzr6,jonnywoh,14,Sun Jun 21 06:15:26 2015 UTC,"One popular theory is that once Valve realized the episodic model wasn't going to work, Source 2 was already in the works, and they decided to wait for that to be mature enough to develop on."
HalfLife,3akzr6,augmaticdisport,5,Sun Jun 21 10:29:23 2015 UTC,"They've actually stated that they've started work and restarted from scratch several times because they weren't 100% happy. Can't remember the source now but it's in an interview somewhere.   They've also confirmed it's being worked on (several times), just not as a top priority. Presumably because of the hardware projects and Steam taking precedence.   It's well known that if you work at Valve, you can choose which projects you want to work on, but really it's more likely that you have to choose the projects that need to be worked on..."
HalfLife,3akzr6,Riomaki,6,Sun Jun 21 12:16:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly. A company has to make a profit one way or the other, and DotA and TF2 are their money makers at the moment.  Besides, who's to say that they don't use said funds for developing HL3? I can't imagine it's a cheap game to make."
HalfLife,3akzr6,Heifsin85,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:51:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, again, I point to that Washington Post article where Gabe Newell  pointed out that one of the problems is people getting bitter when the project they want to work on isn't selected.  Which would imply that the whole ""Do whatever you want"" philosophy only goes so far."
HalfLife,3akzr6,dankfloyd,4,Sun Jun 21 15:43:59 2015 UTC,"Your last sentence explains a big chunk of it. They have been focusing on other games. Also, focusing on their Steam network which is the biggest distributor of PC gaming, and arguably, the project that saved PC gaming, especially indie. Lastly, developing hardware like their VR set.   With all these projects, they then have to take on the most anticipated game of all time? But not only anticipated, but hyped to be ""the game of a lifetime.""  They had much less than all this on their plate during HL 2 and it's subsequent episodes. It just hasn't been that easy to create the greatest game of all time, and every year that passes, they become more busy. But as much as we miss HL, what they are producing is so much more important than one game. So I'm content on waiting each year for an update."
HalfLife,3akzr6,Riomaki,11,Sun Jun 21 11:30:15 2015 UTC,I don't think fallout 4 was ever considered that really. Half-life has just taken a ridiculous amount of time compared to anything else coming out seemingly and their hasn't been much hope for it for me. The hype is dead for me and I don't even know if I would be very excited if it ever did come out unless it looked ridiculously amazing. The bar is very high now compared to hl2 and I think that plays a factor. When we look at things like doom 3 the graphics are still pretty great in comparison to average today graphics. So the step isn't as large. HL just needs to end.
HalfLife,3akzr6,dankfloyd,4,Sun Jun 21 09:34:34 2015 UTC,"I think with Fallout 4, this was the year where I really started to put the Half-Life franchise in the past tense.  I wish it wasn't the case, but how can I ignore the efforts of these developers who are really working hard to do right by their fan base and release the content they demand?"
HalfLife,3akzr6,conorf1807,4,Sun Jun 21 15:59:08 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. Valve does seem to have an agenda that doesn't really cater to their fanbase very much. Sometimes we get lucky. Portal 2 was a great surprise. But beyond that they dont create a whole lot of content like other companies maybe because they have their hands in too many aspects of the gaming market besides just games, like steam platform, steamboxes, Hats, VR, and then lastly games. That's why we see games more frequently from Bethesda or (insert developer) because they are solely a developer and not trying to capitalize on every square inch of gaming as whole."
HalfLife,3akzr6,conorf1807,6,Sun Jun 21 16:39:05 2015 UTC,"DNF, IIRC everyone knew it was coming out eventually, and that someone was working on it.   Thing is with HL3, the story heavily implied a sequel, and valve said there would be 3 episodes. Neither of your examples implied a sequel (or required one for that matter), they're standalone games that continue the story just because people want more after finishing previous games.  What's more, HL3 is so controversial because despite numerous community requests and conferences and petitions etc, valve refuses to mention anything about it. Any leaks have either been quickly disproved, or have questionable sources. The only real thing that we have to go on is lines of code here and there inside source/source2 and other valve related stuff (which usually simply includes the character hl3 and could be entirely coincidental."
HalfLife,3akzr6,Riomaki,0,Sun Jun 21 09:02:29 2015 UTC,"Yes DNF and F4 are standalone games story wise, but HL is connected in each game with the characters and storyline. The two examples don't have to come out since they are not continuing a story, but HL3 is."
HalfLife,3akzr6,duffmanhb,5,Sun Jun 21 12:35:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I said.  However just because HL's story isn't finished doesn't mean the game has to come out. If Valve don't see an value in making the game, or don't know what to do with it, they won't. It's that simple.  What's more, there's too much pressure on them now; HL3 is the most anticipated game of all time. It's physically not possible for it to live up to the 8 year hype its accumulated.  My guess is that it'll never be made, and forever be an Internet legend."
HalfLife,3akzr6,duffmanhb,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:28:03 2015 UTC,"I hate to break it to you, but unless you are a narrative-driven adventure game, story is probably the least important reason to invest  tens of millions of dollars in making a game.  And the Fallout games are connected in that they all take place in the same continuity and world.  It's just not the same protagonist.  In essence, they continue the story of Vault-Tec and its depraved social experiments, the FEV virus, the role of the Enclave, etc."
HalfLife,3akzr6,monkeysrule123,31,Sun Jun 21 16:16:35 2015 UTC,It's just a running tongue and cheek joke.   Valve has been working on hl3 for years and have already scrapped two entire iterations of it.   It's going to come out within the next year. They are just now working on the voice acting
HalfLife,3akzr6,Japface,17,Sun Jun 21 06:16:16 2015 UTC,"Do you have any sources for this?  I'm not saying you're lying, but I'm just a bit skeptical is all."
HalfLife,3akzr6,RaptorDotCpp,73,Sun Jun 21 06:28:49 2015 UTC,"No, that's fair. I really don't have sources, because I can't give sources, since it's just word of mouth from friends within the industry/network. Though, I haven't been wrong in the past.  Last year I mentioned how DotA 2 was currently running a hybrid custom build of Source 2 and got downvoted to hell, also for not being able to give sources... Then 6-9 months later Valve releases their Source 2 framework beta, and now their whole engine.   But it is what it is, and don't really care to prove myself. But if you want to hear some hearsay, I'll give you a quicky on the HL3 development. It started with Valve intending to have a rapid release cycle for the HL series... They went out and contracted tons of different studios to make different episodes. However, the problem was that each studio had their own ""character"" to it, which sort of started fragmenting the HL brand. And then once they won for the second decade in a row, ""Game of the decade"" they realized they couldn't risk tarnishing the brand, so they opted to keep all development in house and scrapping all the other episodes which were intended to progressively deliver the improved engine.  The first attempt at HL3 at a serious level was including the multiplayer mechanics of L4D but on a larger scale. They started toying with an almost MMO style of gameplay, where the game was intended to be played with multiple people, and would always be different. That people could jump in during your campaign, but play as the enemy, to give you and the team a challenge. That other concurent campaigns would effect your current campaign's path. For instance, a team playing the campaign 3 levels behind you could be working on an objective that required taking out a communication uplink for the combine. And if they failed to do it fast enough, the uplink would be able to call in reenforcements, but those reenforcements would arrive a few miles ahead in the city, at your point in the campaign. So you'd be suffering the consequences of their failure. But you'd also see people who branched out on the campaign on a psuedo ""side-quest"" of sorts, and once they completed the destruction of a combine tower, you'd actually see it be destroyed in the distance where you are headed, and are no longer required to do that side quest, because other's have already done it. Basically, every campaign was working with each other to some degree, to create a unique and connected experience.   So it sort of created this interconnected feeling, where everyone wanted to be successful and achieve their objectives so all the 100s of players in the same campaign server would be working together. But this ended up being too ambitious and was highly derailing from the original HL ethos, so they scrapped it.  Then they started working on Portal 2, which was scrapped again, to make room for the portal 2 we know now.   Then the devs were banned from the public Steam network and were forced to use a private internal Steam network for their beta testing, so it goes kind of dark on what exactly they were doing, but whatever it was, they were keeping quiet.  After that, a HUGE amount of internal resources were pushed to DotA 2 because that was their new cash-cow. The private floor was almost entirely dedicated to just DotA 2 for a good while by most of the engineers. However, the designers and mappers were left with not much to do.  Which leads us today. Valve has a good handful of the worlds best designers and mappers, who haven't released anything in a while. Why? Because they've been spending their time playing with Source 2 and building ports for all their current games, and their next HL installment. And just recently, voice actors from HL2 were in the studio, for ""unrelated things"".   Anyways, I'm a bit tipsy and will probably delete this tomorrow. Just take my word for it, or don't. I don't care either way. But expect the roadmap to look like this: DotA 2 to release the new engine and get it out there so they can start doing massive tests on different PC hardware to work out the kinks. Then expect CS to get the first port of Source 2, because CS has a strong community and makes a ton of money, so it would be a great flagship to introduce the engine in proper form to the public. Then expect L4D2/3 to come out as their first ""new game"" on the engine that is actually designed with the source 2 muscle in mind. The finally, they'll be done with HL3 by the end of next year, and we'll get the next game of the decade."

HalfLife,3akzr6,tsahyt,15,Mon Jun 22 15:43:59 2015 UTC,"There's an equal chance that the voice actors from HL2 were there for reasons unrelated to Half-Life. Merle Dandridge (Alyx) now voices the Legion Commander and Winter Wyvern in Dota 2, Mike Shapiro (G-Man, Barney) voices the Oracle, and Hal Robins (Kleiner) voices Tinker. They could have been there for either Dota or HL3, who knows?  The part of your post about the multiplayer campaign is very believable, because it sounds just like what Gabe said about wanting to make all future singleplayer Valve games ""single player plus"" and introduce more elements of interconnectivity. Thank you for sharing this, it's given me even more hope for the next few years, for better or for worse."
HalfLife,3akzr6,jonnywoh,12,Sun Jun 21 07:18:57 2015 UTC,"At this point, I'm pretty much in the dark, and can really only conjecture. However, the last time my good buddy was there a few months ago, they were working on a huge community content development program, and that ALL the employees were still focusing pretty heavily on something. Which raises eyebrows, because in terms of what they've actually been putting out, doesn't actually reflect the amount of content they've delivered.   When I was discussing it, it was easy to excuse the engineers because Valve is making really heavy moves with improving Steam and other ambitious projects like creating a private gaming internet. However, the actual designers on the otherhand, wtf are they doing? They were all busy as fuck as well... But nothing has yet justified wtf they were all so busy working on."

HalfLife,3akzr6,TweetsInCommentsBot,4,Sun Jun 21 17:32:34 2015 UTC,"If you are making parts of this up, (can't know for sure one way or another,) then the part about a large-scale multiplayer HL3 is a stroke of genius because something very similar happened with another game developer.  After releasing Myst and Riven, two of the most popular and influential puzzle adventure games ever made, the developer Cyan Worlds decided to spend 5 years creating a new kind of game: Uru Online, a massively multiplayer puzzle adventure game where the persistent world would reflect the actions of its many players as the community worked together on puzzles and exploration. As they were developing Uru, Cyan had another developer make the third Myst game. Myst 3: Exile was not nearly as highly regarded as the previous titles, and didn't sell nearly as well. Uru Online released its single player portion in 2003, (a third-person game with WASD controls where previous Myst games were first person point-and-click.) The multiplayer portion, sadly, never launched outside a small beta as there just weren't enough predicted subscribers to support the game.  I'm abridging the story really heavily, but basically what you're saying Valve almost did is what Cyan Worlds actually did: Outsource the franchise while making a new game that is a radical departure from the core gameplay in the previous entries of the series. A huge part of Uru's failure is that it was literally a decade ahead of its time, and I doubt Valve could ever fall into the problems Cyan did, but the similarities of the two stories are enough that I felt it would be interesting to bring it up.  Obligatory: Uru is still downloadable and playable in one way or another, including a working version of the online part, though I've never participated in the online community. Meanwhile, Cyan had a successful kickstarter in 2013 to develop a new Myst-like game called Obduction which should be releasing later this year."

Your current gig is an 'unfreezing' operation, scouring a remote old mining operation to determine what structures are safe/salvageable/condemned, and to do said necessary work in advance of a full restoration of operations. There is a surveyor with one of those tripod gymbal scopes, a big fat general purpose hardass construction veteran, a distressingly alcoholic demolitions expert, a mining equipment specialist, a quiet and disdainful french asshole manager who disappears completely for days at a time, etc.  The visual style is photorealistic, not TF2 stylized. You're introduced to VR mechanics including 1:1 motion controls as you disassemble a small outbuilding, with your trusty prybar. This is the gameplay for the first couple hours, and it's fun despite being by any examination actually a relatively mundane IRL job (ok so not really so mundane, due to remoteness and isolation giving real risks, hence why you're in a group so well prepared including a doctor). You're introduced to the world, with foreshadowing and backstory and character info given out through comedic theater-in-the-round HL2-style cinematic. So it's probably not such a huge shock when things start to go very wrong and you find yourself hiding from mercenaries, and over the next few hours find yourself sucked into a full-on secret megacorp war.  Then as soon as you're really getting into it, your new role as a Scout in The Gravel Wars, the game fast-forwards. Control is taken from you and you see an accelerating pace playthrough of hundreds of hours of unmistakeable TF2 gameplay, gradually (which is to say very quickly) become more stylized as it goes, until it's just plain TF2.  And then The Voice starts talking directly to you. Telling you things you don't want to know, about the nature of the war, about the state of the Earth, about your comrades, about what year it really is. She wants you two to properly introduce yourselves, and the inherent wrongness of that gesture to equality is striking to you. She is simply The Voice, and you don't want her to have a name. Not even (especially not even?) one as inherently bookish and grandmotherly as Gladys.  And that's the tutorial."

He stomps out, his red helmet visor staring at you as he pulls out the Combine's newest weapon.

But there are some tricky cases too, like when it would never run no matter what the input is:  unsigned int userProvidedNumber; cin >> userProvidedNumber;  if (userProvidedNumber > 0) {     ... } else {     // oops! unsigned ints are always >0, this will never run }   Another example is the case where even if the code inside the if ran, it wouldn't have any side effects on the rest of the program. That's also dead code."
HalfLife,3ai1to,netshroud,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:22:26 2015 UTC,If the related files are never included in the DOTA2 code then they are just useless.
HalfLife,3ai1to,rawrYT,3,Sat Jun 20 17:17:01 2015 UTC,"The original source had a problem with the removal of such code, which is why you can see alot of stuff in it that has no meaning. Source 2 being a much more modern game engine probably has a way of not including this code."
HalfLife,3ai1to,netshroud,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:35:16 2015 UTC,The original source had a problem with the removal of such code   Care to elaborate?
HalfLife,3ai1to,rawrYT,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:58:18 2015 UTC,"If you look at the Source Engine and the games it's released, each time we got a new game coming out on a version of the source engine, which was in some way upgraded through a previous title, you'd find alot of traces from that, and other previous titles.  These leftover pieces of code had no place in the actual game that was made, and only took up space in the game. Source did not know welther or not this code was used, so its included automatically. It's like how you can spawn a zombie from hl2 in portal.  This is only parts of the game however, and not useless code within the engine. The point I was trying to make was that the actual Source engine would not know if resources inside a package would be used or not, and therefore would include it ""just to be safe"".  To remove this kind of junk on the source engine, a developer would've had to sit and delete everything which isn't required for the finished package to work.   Because Valve are only around 50 people working, they always want to make processes take as little time from their own as possible, hence why they automated the refund system instead of putting valuable employees to approve every refund request they are getting.  Having them sit and delete a metric ton of textures/models/sounds/etc. they didn't get to use in their game might actually take a bit of a hit to their efficency, and so they had to find a way to make this process less ""labour"" heavy.  I believe Source 2 might know how to do delete unused material automatically, which is why Valve are saying that the engine is going to have a performance boost on even older computers that had trouble running the original Source. As their PCs do not have to load up useless resources that will sit there and do nothing.  Please feel free to correct me on anything I have said, as I just woke up and felt I needed to answer."
HalfLife,3ai1to,SlappyCromwell,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:03:12 2015 UTC,"AFAIK Source 1 only loaded what was specified, however Valve likely forgot to #ifdef a few things out on releases - both code and their build script(s), or simply determined that there was no additional cost and left them in on purpose.  From what I understand there's no big (SOURCE ENGINE) tree in Perforce that contains all their code for all their games, rather each game has it's own engine branch and game-specific code on that branch. I would expect the same of their asset tree. Thus it's not an engine limitation so much as human fallibility that they don't remove unused codes and assets from a branch.  Beyond that though, where did you get the idea that a) Valve are only 50 people, and b) that the refund system is entirely automated?"
HalfLife,3ai1to,NeoKabuto,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:25:42 2015 UTC,"Sorry about the 50 people part of Valve, I was looking to an outdated source about that. They're more than twice as much people. Still, that's an incredibly small amount of people working at one of the greatest companies in the world. Every person at Valve is incredibly important to the company, and therefore they do not have the time to be sitting there taking in all the refunds manually.  I did not state that the refund system was entierly automated, but that it has a level of automation to make the whole refund part of steam be take less of a performance hit from their employees."

Presumably the stuff they were trying to achieve in Ep. 3 will now be possible under the new engine and dev can kick into full gear."

HalfLife,3ai1to,ethosaur,3,Sat Jun 20 14:13:42 2015 UTC,Thank you!   I logged onto Steam about 15 minutes ago and noticed DOTA was trying to update so I'm not sure if anything relevant has been added.  I used a batch script to convert all of the dlls in the DOTA files to .txt for convenience and then using a program called Agent Ransack to scan them all quickly.  You could do the same if you wished.
HalfLife,3ai1to,smashitup,2,Sat Jun 20 14:32:12 2015 UTC,Awesome... thanks.  So you searched DOTA2 source 2 build? What about DOTA Workshop Alpha?  Does any one know where we could find a list of strings we could search for?

But I have an idea... What if we:   Developed a regexp search that we run each update on source 2 related products using Agent Ransack Export the results of each search into CSV Upload and share our searches with a few details (Game, search date, etc) Analyse the results using SQL/R to see how the frequencies of certain key terms change over time.   That way we could rule out the old stuff which gives us false signals."

HalfLife,3ahssi,jatatcdc,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:57:52 2015 UTC,"How hard can it be to map a key-press to an action on a certain part of the emulator screen, really?   they'd have to have it in the same exact position of the screen and likely on a screen with the same resolution   Offsets don't have to be specified in pixels, you know?  I mean, if someone could figure out how to build an emulator for it, surely they'd be smart enough to figure out this rather trivial problem."
HalfLife,3ahssi,hooblesFTW,2,Sun Jun 21 00:35:08 2015 UTC,"Well it's hard to say any of that without actually doing it.   But the other problem is that short of the emulator in XCode (which requires source files), I'm not aware of any iOS emulators. I know there's Android emulators, but not iOS. Just to double check I searched for some, but the results were for emulators for consoles that run on iOS."
HalfLife,3ahssi,jatatcdc,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:50:41 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that people have something like this. There is a iOS tweak (unassigned code) that allows you to use a PS3 or 4 gamepad on an iOS device. I've used it before, and it's pretty simple."
HalfLife,3ahssi,Riomaki,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:17:05 2015 UTC,"Well iOS has controller support, but my understanding is that (aside from maybe jail breaking) developers have to set that up."

I certainly wouldn't want some chintzy mobile ""Half-Life-3-in-name-only"" kind of deal, but if it was a revolutionary experience somehow adapted to the mobile format, sure.  Sign me up.  It's all hypothetical anyway.  Mind you, I have no idea how a mobile FPS would work.  The only mobile FPS I've played is NOVA 3 which is ultimately rather clunky to control, even though I can tell they really tried to make it work.  That said, even though  it is complemented by buttons, Splatoon on the Wii U has surprisingly good motion aiming."
HalfLife,3ahssi,kingkolton9,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:12:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, while some mobile games have shown me that the platform actually has superior controls for certain genres (Vainglory for MOBAs; every point-and-click ever; Bastion, Oceanhorn, and Battleheart for RPGs/Adventure Games), I've yet to see a mobile FPS that made me think, ""Oh, this platform is really great for FPS games.""   That being said, I'd actually love to see how Valve would approach making a mobile FPS work well. There's definitely a lot of room for innovation in first-person controls on mobile."

HalfLife,3agv0f,AMajali,9,Sat Jun 20 02:09:03 2015 UTC,"I agree, it doesn't take 8 years to make one game, but I believe, and also read someone else's predictions on this matter, that Valve started working on Episode 3 right after Episode 2 came out. They ended up taking a while to make the game, and found some limitations within the Source Engine. Somewhere around that time, they decided it was better to make a completely new engine, and a new game instead of another Episode. Since they had to make a new engine and probably port stuff from Ep3 to the Source 2 Engine, this could explain the 8 year wait.

But I'm pretty sure they don't know what kind of game to create, I believe they have said that if they ever do make it it'll be because they want to make it not because they are forced to do so.  I don't understand why people keep expecting it to come, dudes, walk away from the franchise a bit, explore others and once Valve is ready they'll announce the game."

Last time I checked Gabe Defense Force (GDF for short) was pulling in exactly the other direction, saying ""OMG GUYS THEY DONT HAVE TO MAKE A GAME THEY DONT OWE YOU ANYTHING"" So which is it exactly?  Besides, if you're trying to tell me that attending E3 for a standard meet and greet like all other major (and even some minor) developers is out of reasonable expectation for Valve as a company, then I place no stock or faith in Valve."
HalfLife,3agv0f,washout77,-4,Sat Jun 20 02:12:31 2015 UTC,"Valid point, but if Valve stepped out at E3 and said ""We're working on it"" the hype would die down a bit and when the game comes out they can't make as much money (bottom line, they are a company that has to make money). When the game is further into development (or likely near finished) Valve will HOPEFULLY say something instead of prematurely starting a hype train when the game is earlier into development."

HalfLife,3ae2ya,Streak_,4,Fri Jun 19 10:59:03 2015 UTC,"I tried playing HL2RP, but got banned because I didn't listen to the CP. I was trying to be a rebel. Plus it just wasn't that fun. There was like 25 people on but I couldn't find any and voice was disabled.   Is that just one server or are all of them like that? Seems like a cool thing to get into."
HalfLife,3ae2ya,skinkbaa,7,Fri Jun 19 18:36:47 2015 UTC,"Well, HL2RP is all about serious roleplay.  If you go right from the start trying to be a rebel, you will NOT have a good time. Not only that, but any Citizen would listen to a CP unless they knew their life was about to end if they did. Remember, in real life, a HL2 citizen would be terrified of CPs, just like they are in the game.  It's all about developing a character. Not just putting points in him and getting him weapons, but ACTUALLY developing your character. It's like a book, where your character is just one of many. You have to develop them, give them stories to talk about, lessons to learn.  Not only that, but the resistance in most servers don't just hold open recruitment booths where you just sign up. In the realm of HL2RP, the resistance is deathly afraid of being caught. They will do anything possible not to get caught.  Have you ever read 1984? It's a fanTASTIC book by George Orwell that gave a LOT of inspiration to the Dystopian cities in Half Life 2. In said book, the resistance is almost never seen, some citizens don't even believe in it. The resistance are extremely secretive and never show themselves.  While HL2RP resistance isn't SUPER secret, they surely wouldn't walk around on the surface so that any loyalist, CP, or camera can spot them. Their recruitment is VERY harsh, because if they let the wrong person in, it's over.  Anyways, HL2RP is something you just kind of have to get used too. I never got into it until about two or three tries at it. Just don't act unrealistic and don't break rules and you should be fine.  Just wondering, what server did you play on?"
HalfLife,3ae2ya,tgkennedy,2,Fri Jun 19 19:16:54 2015 UTC,"I have no clue, it was ages ago.   Thanks for all the insight. I'll give it another go tonight and report back."
HalfLife,3ae2ya,skinkbaa,5,Fri Jun 19 19:26:43 2015 UTC,"Also, a little tip.  HL2RP is something that requires a LOT of patience. It isn't something you can just powerhouse through and become the top man within a week. I'm talking a LOT of patience.  For some, it takes maybe two months to get to a high point. But for most, it takes a long time. Some go months before they ever get into the resistance, or get to a high rank within the Civil Protection. It depends on your RP, their standard of recruitment, if they even are, and if they trust you as a good RPer and a trustworthy character.  Don't take this in a negative way though. It's character development. Some people find many things to do without even joining the resistance or Civil Protection.  And another tip, please don't follow a resistance member if you find one and beg to get in, you'll be labelled as a bad roleplayer."
HalfLife,3ae2ya,tgkennedy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:34:06 2015 UTC,"I think the real issue with HL2RP is finding a good server. I just used the GMod server finder to try and get in after doing some reading up about the gamemode, first one I got into had me download 1000 plugins from the workshop, including things that seemed pointless to the roleplay such as 6 packs worth of combine skins and a lot of silly sounding weapons; after all that I get in to find everything's an error texture anyways and there's barely anyone anywhere.  I later met this guy who was apparently anticitizen 1, and somehow had nothing to do with the resistance and even said he killed most of the lambda resistance because they were self righteous jerks. So then my character had the impasse of being subject to the evils of the combine or join a gang of self-serving lunatics who don't care who dies or lives.  Fun times."
HalfLife,3ae2ya,Teh_lolheavy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:43:27 2015 UTC,"That sounds terrible...  What server was that? It doesn't sound like any server I know about.  Anyways, finding a good server is somewhat out of preferences.  However, along with each server is usually a major downside.  If you want a good starting server with a lot of people on it, but you don't feel confident with your RP, try TnB. They have around 50 people a day (Sometimes up to 60 or 70) and while they do have good coding and system, they have a lower standard of RP, which means you'll find some less then average players there. It's a good server to start HL2RP on, but keep in mind that they do NOT use Clockwork (The most popular system for HL2RP) but their own custom script known as Taco script. It's a little different then normal RP, but again, it's good for starters. Hell, you can stay there even after you become good, I heard they do have good Roleplayers if you just find them. Also, due to a lower standard of RP, it attracts a lot of minges (Players who cause unrest by breaking rules and having bad roleplay in general. Similar to newer players, but more malicious.) So it can be quite hectic at times.  I have heard from people that play there that there is a lot of gossip and behind-the-back talk around their community, more then others, but that in itself is a rumor.  They can be found here.  Lemon Punch is also a decent server. They have a good standard of RP and good coding as well, but the problem is that they have REALLY off lore from canon, kind of their own custom lore so to say. Each server has their own, but LemonPunch from my experience has WAY different lore. They are also more Citizen based from what I can tell, choosing not to have such a big CP theme, but I'd have to play more on their server to really tell. They get a good pop as well, up their with TnB. I'm not sure about their content, I don't remember that part really well. I do believe they have a moderate amount of content, but not as much as TnB.  They can be found here.  The final one I'd have to recommend, and the server I play on, would have to be Hellzone RP, or more specifically its child server, Reality Roleplay HL2RP. They do have a fairly higher standard of RP, but as long as you choose to comply with administration, they'll teach you and give you the resources needed to learn. They don't have the BEST pop, usually they get around 15 to 20 a day, uncommonly, they can get around 5 a day, while sometimes we get around 30. It's good for those who aren't bothered by low pop, as low population isn't exactly a bad thing when it comes to RP. They also have a fairly small content pack, but it provides all the needed things. The content pack, since I know where it is, can be found here. They also try to keep a fair balance between Citizens and CPs. Due to our lower population, things are slower, and it can be kind of difficult to find RP if you don't know where it is, but with enough looking around, you should be able to find it. A benefit out of this is that you can take your time and learn the basics. And again, as long as you aren't rude or agonizingly stubborn, the admins will be happy to teach you.  Our forums can be found here.  Hope this helped you out, let me know how it goes!"
HalfLife,3ae2ya,tgkennedy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:06:35 2015 UTC,"Really? A pancho vort is considered a needed addon for the server? Hmmph.   as low population isn't exactly a bad thing when it comes to RP   I agree, but it's nice to just see people walking around the town square, you know? The one server I visited when trying the mod out that had a fair amount of people was nice, as it gave the impression that it was a real world. If there's <10 players on and none of them are in the town square or other main areas, it's kinda sad when the place is a ghost town and I am fully allowed to run around the town square brandishing a gun screaming ""I HATE THE COMBINE, I HATE THE COMBINE!"" without fear of repercussion.   One of the most important things to an RP is the feeling of a real world. I take out a gun and start shooting, I want a big CP army to be dispatched to kill me, not the one or two that happen to be in the server. I don't want to have my poor character wander through empty streets until he stumbles upon the roleplay, I want to be able to run up to the nearest group of civilians and say ""Hey guys, what's going on?""  Thanks for the links, though. I've heard some nasty things about lemonpunch so I might avoid that, but I think I'll check the others out."
HalfLife,3ae2ya,Teh_lolheavy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:37:32 2015 UTC,"Eh, didn't notice that the vort had a Pancho. We don't use vorts much yet because we have had trouble with vort players in the past. You probably don't have to download it.  I understand what you mean by a dead plaza, it is odd to see a city with no people, but some maps have a LOT of places to go, so people don't exactly hang around plaza. As for searching for RP, I can understand what you are getting at, but you could also try places like bars or shops, those also have a lot of activity."

It isn't something you can just powerhouse through and become the top man within a week. I'm talking a LOT of patience.   I once joined a server, walked around for a few hours before anything happened. In order, I was refused a ration, kidnapped by resistance, threatened castration, and used as a meat shield before having my throat slit and being thrown over a roof.  It was a pretty crazy 20 minutes."

HalfLife,3ahxb0,The_Ponnitor,2,Sat Jun 20 21:06:49 2015 UTC,"Valve have learned a lot in making recent multiplayer games, but that doesn't mean they will give up on making singleplayer experiences. In 2011 Gabe said that, because of the rise of social media in recent years and the market for interconnectivity, Valve want to add social components to singleplayer games. I quote: ""It's 'single-player plus,' not 'no more single-player.'""  This statement was reinforced only a few months ago when asked about future singleplayer games, when he said ""If you want to do another Half-Life game and you want to ignore everything we've learned in shipping Portal 2 and in shipping all the updates on the multiplayer side, that seems like a bad choice. So we'll keep moving forward. But that doesn't necessarily always mean what people are worried that it might mean.""  This leads me to believe that Half-Life 3 will feature both a singleplayer campaign and more multiplayer features than HL2. If they ever made a HL3 Deathmatch, it would not come as a separate download but together with HL3."

HalfLife,3ahxb0,CKAHK,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:41:44 2015 UTC,"Valve knows that the fans will buy HL3. They will definitely make loads of money off of it no doubt. Gabe said the only reason they would work on a classic singleplayer game is if a group of people in the company WANTED to. I'm sure there are people there that wanted to make the game. And it doesn't even have to be a fully singleplayer game. Likely they will make a Deathmatch like they did with the other two Half Life games, and there's always a possibility of a Co-op mode like Portal 2."

People who don't even know what it is have heard of it, and will likely buy it out of curiosity.  Just because you have some long term stuff planned out doesn't mean a quick cash grab isn't worth it.  My thinking is:  Launch it with a campaign and a L4D style multiplayer, add regular updates to both (so similar to episodes but on a less demanding schedule) and use it as a platform to test out new ideas for other games.  Not to mention, it will surely entice people into joining Steam as well.  It can be extremely profitable in the way Valve wants it to."
HalfLife,3aawpk,bothanspy1337,3,Thu Jun 18 21:39:18 2015 UTC,"So I've read on reddit and other sources that Valve employees choose what they work on so they don't feel like they have to do one task they don't want to do and hate their job. My thoughts are that no one wants to make it. Just imagine working at Valve. You want to make the fans happy, you know how many people want Half Life 3. But you don't want to be ""that guy"" who started the development of a highly anticipated game that turned out to be shit.   That's my idea, anyway. I'm just gonna keep with thinking it'll never happen. Saves myself from disappointment if it never comes out, but I'll be happy if it does."
HalfLife,3aawpk,TreHad,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:47:49 2015 UTC,"They choose what they work on, but Gaben still has some oversight. The system they have set up means a potential HL3 team has to justify spending tens of millions of dollars and a majority of Valve's resources to produce a game that will have relatively small profit margins.  That's a hard sell and you can realize why they aren't working on it. Considering how much they make on all their other projects that use a lot less money and man power.  That's what gabe has basically been alluding to for a long time, the only reason they might make it is as a tool to advance some other technology, medium, gameplay somethingorother, etc."
HalfLife,3aawpk,gotlactose,2,Fri Jun 19 20:29:02 2015 UTC,Even Duke Nukem was eventually announced and that was a big supposed vaporware before this whole HL3 circlejerk hit mass hysteria levels.
HalfLife,3aawpk,Ziday,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:25:27 2015 UTC,I'm in the exact same boat as you. If they decide to never make Half life 3 for some reason they will at the very least give us an end to the story in one way or another.

It's probably something they keep trying and are not satisfied with, and they just put it off intending to get round to it at some point in the future. They haven't mentioned it because they haven't cancelled it outright, but they don't want to commit to anything or tell people that they're not really focusing on ut.

HalfLife,3aawpk,lumpy999,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:59:58 2015 UTC,"""So what did happen? As Newell and the team have explained, by July it was obvious that Half-Life 2 would not be finished in time for a September 30 release. So why was Valve still telling the public in late August that the game was on schedule? ""We were paralyzed,"" Newell says. ""We knew we weren't going to make the date we promised, and that was going to be a huge fiasco and really embarrassing. But we didn't have a new date to give people either."" In other words, Newell didn't want to announce the delay until he had a new official date to announce. It's that simple. ""So I decided we should just stay quiet,"" he says.  Still, there's a difference between staying quiet and confirming a ship date that you know to be incorrect. Newell says that, in retrospect, he may have made the wrong decision on this front. At the time, however, he didn't want to announce the delay until he had something better to tell the fans. ""I didn't want to go to 'when it's done' or announce 17 different dates over the next few months,"" he says."""

We need to datamine the shit out of this release for evidence of other projects.  They may have assumed this is what the public would do but I highly doubt they'd re-write the entire engine for each game they make.  For those who don't know what I'm talking about - We found Half-Life 2 Episode 1 stuff in the original Half-Life 2 SDK. We also found Portal 2 stuff in the Episode 2 SDK. In the past references to ""HL3"" have been found in DOTA .dlls and such. The ""HL3"" string could mean anything. We do know however, that the other games were attached to these variables in core files: ""HL2"" ""EP1"" ""EP2"" ""CSS"" & ""L4D"".  I will be trying my hand at this and will share anything I find."

When I had Half-Life 1, I think I got as far as the rocket guy in On A Rail before I stopped.  It wasn't the game's fault.  Having grown up with Doom, Descent, Unreal Tournament... there were a lot of things I legitimately did not understand about the way Half-Life worked.  That you could manually reload.  That the crates had items in them and I was supposed to smash every one.  The game is quite difficult when you don't know these things.  I played Half-Life 2 soon after its release and found it astonishing.  Like Left 4 Dead, it was also the game that told me - hey, you should obsessively reload.  And the crates which contained stuff clearly contained stuff.  Oh, so this is how you're supposed to play Half-Life!  Last year, I went back and played through Half-Life 1 knowing everything I know now.  It was a lot of fun.  I still like Half-Life 2 more for the sheer variety of gameplay, enemies and environments - not to mention editing - but I had just as much fun playing Half-Life 1 as I probably would have back then... if I understood it. :)"

HalfLife,3a8y2z,swampie2,4,Thu Jun 18 16:47:28 2015 UTC,"I immersed myself in Half-Life 2 first and fell so in love with everything about the game. It was way more than a game. I will honestly never forget first stepping off that train and into the nightmare that Earth had become. I knew nobody, I had no connections in this world but something drove me to fight for it. Some shared humanity made me fight. Finishing the game was so utterly satisfying. I knew however, deep down, that I could never be a true fan until I played the first, the original. It took me YEARS to sit myself down and start it and I was utterly blown away by Half-Life 1 when I played it for the first time recently. Absolutely phenomenal game and honestly after playing so much of Half-Life 2, Half-Life 1 felt so foreign and yet so incredibly familiar. The sound effects, the characters, it was such a fantastic experience and VERY fulfilling. I felt I was a psuedo-Half Life fan before this because I hadn't played the first so it was so great to finally tick that off my bucket list and continue on my journey towards becoming a true Half Lifer."

I sat listening to the credit theme (which also adds to the mood quite a bit, might I say) all the way through, and then just sat staring into the blackness for a good five minutes. Sure, I felt accomplished, but I felt strangely empty knowing my journey was over. Of course, I then went on to play all the other games and replay Half-Life 14 times and counting, but still."

HalfLife,3a81bq,Brunoob,2,Thu Jun 18 13:32:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like some people are thinking about VR all wrong. It's not some peripheral you hook up to your PC to enhance the experience, it's an entirely new platform with an entirely new form factor that requires very specific and careful development. A traditional PC game (Half-Life) is not going to play well at all on VR, and vice versa. Several years down the line I can easily see Valve developing games specifically tailored for the VR experience, maybe even based off their existing game universes. But that's not until VR really takes off and gets in the hands of average consumers."
HalfLife,3a81bq,Pain_Fly,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:28:30 2015 UTC,"Gabe said they wont be making anything steam machine exclusive so I dont think that its probable that anything will be VR exclusive.I know you didn't say exclusive OP, but making it VR orientated in the sense that the game elements will be VR showcase orientated is probably not a good Idea either since not everyone will be buying VR headsets because they are an extra expense.So just cutting your potential buyers(market) in half is not something even Valve would do.But it probably will be a sort of graphical/engine showcase since that really is what half-life always is."

HalfLife,3a81bq,monkeysrule123,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:18:32 2015 UTC,"Most of the comments ITT are either neutral on VR or are against the idea because they've got some preconceived notions about it.   Have any of you actually used a VR headset within the confines of your own home and not at some game show or convention? Having taken the time to mess around with what few games support it and see what kind of results I can get out of it has certainly given me a different view of VR.   Firstly not everybody gets VR sickness, I for one don't, friends are mixed as some don't get it either and some do. This is not surprising considering that the VR hardware we've got now isn't perfect, it's really just the precursor(s) of what's to come.  Now since this is the HL sub I'll speak to the VR experience in HL2. There are a number of settings in the console under the vr_ group of commands, in particular there is a setting related to aiming and your head and it's got three modes: (Not proper order but it's been a while)  1 - Aiming is tied to your view, anywhere you look, your cross hair goes.  This is fun for the novelty at looking at some shmuck metrocop and only using your mouse for its buttons to fire or what ever you've got bound. Kind gets annoying and tiring on the neck after a while.  2 - Semi attached view aiming. Where your cross hair and head/view share controll of orientation for your body and aim.  This is the default setting, it let's you move the mouse within a dead zone where it won't rotate your character but will rotate once the mouse hits the edge of the dead zone. Your view is also restrained to a dead zone, you can look around but completely turning around (look behind yourself) will force your character to rotate.  Not a bad mode, not a great mode but that's just mostly taste and preferences.  3 - Disjointed head and aiming. Where your head/view is independent of your aim and visa versa.  Your aiming is tied to the mouse, hence you can look over your shoulder to see behind yourself while still running forward and shooting straight ahead. Or aim to your side and keep looking straight ahead.  This is my preferred mode of VR in any Source game (works in tf2 also, pretty fun too) and I find it provides the widest range of flexibility and freedom of motion, although if you're not good with spacial awareness this mode will be hell as it's easy to lose track of where you're looking, where your walking and where your aiming, as all three are independent in mode 3.  So all in all, for agame that wasn't designed with VR in mind, HL2 and TF2 stack up really well if you find the right setting for yourself, and there's nothing like running and gunning through nova prospekt, running past a corridor full of soldiers while spraying the SMG to my side, or watching/fighting the antlion guard as it charges at you and you dodge out of the way just in time, in VR you really get a good appreciation of size of NPCs and environments too, and the antlion guard is pretty big let me tell you.  To cap it off, I think Valve WILL do something with VR and HL3, certainly it's not going to be exclusively VR, but it's certainly not not going to be in HL3. With Valve moving forward with the Vive too, I wouldnt be surprised that the reveal of HL3 will be close to (relatively speaking) the proper launch of the consumer version of the Vive, so 2016 basically, then again perhaps that's just an old HL player trying to appease the void and silence in my mind regarding when HL3 will come to be.  Damn it Gaben, I know these things take time, but hurry the fuck up!"

For instance, Portal 2 came out in 2011, so 4 years after HL2 EP 2, nad in that they had a little Easter egg about the Borealis - Now if valve had no intention of doing another half life installment then they definitely wouldn't have done that, that little thing was there message to me saying ""don't worry, its still in our heads too"" but that's just what i think"

You don’t want them to sort of burrow into that – you want them to recognize that being really good at Half-Life level design is not as nearly as valued as thinking of how to design social multi-player experiences.   My interpretation of that is, yes, there are people at Valve who want to make Half-Life 3, but they are vetoed by those who want to make DOTA or focus on other multiplayer games with social and long-term monetization elements.

There were a bunch of people internally who thought Steam was a really bad idea, but what they didn't think was that they would tell the people who were working on Steam what to do with their time.

I was 12 years old when I played Episode 2, now I'm a 20 year old man. I'm fed up with having 0 transparency from Valve. Most of their fans are going to be fucking dead by the time they speak the word ""3"". You can talk about how pessimism is tainting the community all you want, but how could you blame anyone getting sick of waiting and moving on? I've made up my own ending to the story. It sucks, but it's closure."

They have their flaws as we do, and want to give us the best thing that will move the Half Life name forward.

HalfLife,3a4dv7,LombaxTheGreat,18,Wed Jun 17 03:39:17 2015 UTC,The guy on the PC gamer stream just said they invited valve and valve denied the invite so we were lied to.

Why anyone would place their bets on a surprise appearance at a Sony or other company's conference makes no sense considering valve is trying to promote steam machines and their own vr platform. All we ever got was a supposed intro video with names listed that was pretty obviously place holder and the past day a few people joking about half life 3 (including a child on a show) and a random tweet from Chet that just happened to include the numeral 3. These aren't signs worth a Damn when you consider how valve has been way the hell more obvious with its cryptic ARGs in the past.

HalfLife,3a4eah,Japface,7,Wed Jun 17 04:00:53 2015 UTC,"It's going on 9 years now that we've been waiting for the end of the cliffhanger they left us on. That's why people had their hopes up, fans are dying of old age. If I'm being honest, I've lost a lot of interest myself, too. Nobody should have to wait this long for the continuation of such an iconic storyline that grips so many people, it's cruel. That's why I had my hopes up, anyway. HAD."
HalfLife,3a4eah,Limb0cs,3,Wed Jun 17 04:10:43 2015 UTC,"i long ago largely stopped caring about gaming in general, half life included, though when something half life does come out i'll be ready to jump back on board that bandwagon. Either way, there really was zero reason to get excited or to think there was going to be an announcement this E3. Maybe this year for the Vive, but its doubtful considering Chet had mentioned FPS games and VR really arent a great match, and that room experiences are just a lot better.   I honestly wouldnt even be surprised if half life 3 comes out, its not really half life 3 but some VR room centric off shoot, or even a complete remake of the entire series since its been so long. who the hell from the past few generations would even know half life 1 or 2 at this point? its just people in their late 20s and 30s, and 40s at this point. most of those people are busy with jobs and raising children. its probably also why valve is more focused on other franchises. dota2 is this generations big game from valve. half life is the past."
HalfLife,3a4eah,Japface,2,Wed Jun 17 04:16:14 2015 UTC,Valve needs to criticized way more for their apparent lack of giving a shit about their fans anymore.
HalfLife,3a4eah,superman_dat_hoe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:40:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed. They're so concerned about breaking promises that they'd rather just ignore the community altogether.

HalfLife,3a4eah,MashMango,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:07:39 2015 UTC,Valve wasn't on the list. Why did people actually expect them to be there?  At least with Fallout we knew Bethesda was going to be there.

HalfLife,3a4ykn,Dudugs,3,Wed Jun 17 07:04:31 2015 UTC,"They did promise a trilogy of episodes, and that they would follow the Ep 2 cliffhanger with Episode 3 which would wrap up the current storyline but would not be the final HL .  And then nothing. 7 years (and 8 months), nothing. Zilch, nada. Not a word. HL2's 10 year anniversary - no mention. Valve's communication with their fans is abysmal. Just a ""yes we're working on it"", ""hang in there"" or ""we're sorry but have patience"" would help so much but they just won't.  When (if) it comes out I'll buy it, I'll love it, but I'll never have the same admiration or respect for Valve that I used to have."
HalfLife,3a4ykn,MashMango,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:52:55 2015 UTC,They didn't promise anything this E3 and yet many people are acting like they did.

IT'S A MYSTERY."
HalfLife,3a4ykn,Froggmann5,-1,Wed Jun 17 08:28:45 2015 UTC,"Actually it is a mystery. After seven years, you would expect people to stop being so hyped every single year.

I was excited to see them back in Arwings and not on the ground talking to dinosaurs.  And I like the idea of taking it back to it's roots.  The gameplay looks like StarFox and that's all I'm worried about.  I'm also excited for Mario Maker.  Really excited."
HalfLife,3a3pdu,ryanisawesome124,0,Wed Jun 17 01:44:59 2015 UTC,I do think Starfox is visually quite weak right now.  It needs some of that lighting magic that Mario Kart 8 has in spades.

HalfLife,3a3pdu,PaulHannonJr,2,Wed Jun 17 03:17:18 2015 UTC,"Well, it was pretty lackluster after Sony and Microsoft's.  No big revelations.  Zelda Wii U was a no show.  They mostly elaborated on games we already knew about, with a focus on Starfox Zero.  The Twitterverse also picked up on an unfortunate subtext of the presentation, which was how few Wii U games were announced in the longer term versus 3DS games.  It seems to paint the picture that they're currently in the process of dropping the Wii U and shifting development to whatever the NX will be.  Which is a shame.  Wii U has its flaws, but the first-party titles they did release showed Nintendo at the top of their game in terms of design and creativity."

Also, please don't drag pcmasterrace into this, the people who don't want a gaming pc and want to stick with a console are called peasants, let me explain why.  These people are easily pleased with a shitty life quality and are mostly small minded, they live of a potato plantage and are always dirty from working.  Now we from the "" pc master race "" are smarter because we choose quality above all the rest, we're smarter kinder and polite, also cleaner.  We've got everything cheaper on steam, we can always upgrade our system when we have the need for even a better quality.  We have all the games we want in a simple click of the mouse, we van expand our screens to 2/3/4/5/6/...  I mean, they buy a console, buy the games ALWAYS at full price, if I should have 700 euro, and a peasant would have 700 euro, I can guarantee you that I'll have thee times more games and a better faster and of course 10x the quality.   They buy a console because it's easy, while actually it's even worse than they can imagine, their being lied to right in the face...  You should not feel sympathetic for peasant because they've chosen that life style, and I'm sorry buddy, but I'm not sure about peasants getting the orange box, perhaps, maybe, maybe they'll buy a pc or build one of their smart of course.  But i would feel bad that valve will make their games shitty, literally take a fucking huge Shit on the Orange box so a fucking console can play it..  The quality of the orange box, will be the same as half life 1, even worse.  I've given enough reasons for people to build a gaming pc or buy a laptop or pc prebuild."

HalfLife,3a64zu,fortunesend,0,Wed Jun 17 15:08:33 2015 UTC,"I would say an anniversary, although they totally ignored Half-Life 2's 10th.  I think 2017 would be ten years since Episode Two and that will be here sooner than you think.  Other than that, HL3 would carve out its own niche.  Much like Fallout 4, it doesn't need to be paired with anything.  It simply needs to exist.  Although Fallout 4 took the cake, in my opinion, a lot of vaporware became reality at this E3, including The Last Guardian and the Final Fantasy VII remake.  Half-Life 3 would have still made an impact, and probably sealed this E3 as the most epic one in years."

HalfLife,3a196i,super6plx,0,Tue Jun 16 13:56:58 2015 UTC,"Crysis 1 splashscreens ran at 1800 fps on my 8600GTS back in 2008, making the loudest coil whine sound you've ever heard. I don't know what you mean about the <200fps thing.  Hell even counter strike and CS:S both ran between 300 and 1,000 fps on my system years and years ago, and this is in-game, not even a splashscreen."
HalfLife,3a196i,super6plx,0,Tue Jun 16 19:32:30 2015 UTC,"A. What do you mean by that? If I run Crysis now the same thing will happen. Actually I made a quick vid to show it in case you wanted to see  Edit: running off my external USB hard drive too, showing storage doesn't enter into it  B. In the current iteration of Source, nothing is loading during the splashscreen, it's just a render loop much like that crysis vid. Hard drives, GPU, RAM etc. don't come into it whatsoever.  Also it's not an entirely new engine, it's just a new iteration of the source engine like what Source was to Goldsrc.  C. Check these pics I took real quick showing the FPS I usually get in CSS. GPU bumps up to around 65c before fans spin up a bit and it sits there indefinitely. And the max it ever gets to on maps like aztec, based on my fan noise, would be around 70c. CS:S never has and could never make my gpu overheat, there just isn't enough going on in that game.  Edit: the number glitch in the third photo is from my phone's camera having a longer exposure and thus capturing 2 or 3 frames overlapping instead of just 1.  In fact you want to get 300+ FPS in competitive at all times due to the way Source calculates movement and aiming per frame."
HalfLife,3a196i,super6plx,0,Wed Jun 17 03:55:49 2015 UTC,"Calling BS on that being an accurate reading. Especially considering that those splashscreens are, uh, prerecorded.  That isn't a ""coil,"" either. If you have a mechanical harddrive (Non-SSD), that's the sound.   Well all I can do is provide proof and try to educate you, it's up to you whether you ignore it or not I guess. And you are ignoring it. You can't just call BS on something you don't believe, you need to back it up and tell me why. There's no reason for me to turn around and say this software, made by nVidia, (not to mention FRAPS which gets the same reading) that counts frames accurately is now wrong.  Here's a better demonstration of Coil Whine. It's a phenomenon known to be caused by the GPU, the CPU (more accurately the power coils themselves that are surrounding the CPU bracket on the motherboard) and sometimes PSU too. I have zero mechanical HDDs inside my system. The coil whine is audible running any game over around 100-200 fps. It happens both with and without the mechanical USB drive attached.  This isn't exactly a debate it's more of a proven thing that you yourself can verify using your own components in your system in front of you.   Yes, it does. Transfer rates are typically the bottleneck.   Yes, when you are loading something, but not in something like a splashscreen or a menu. There's 0% usage during these splashscreens and menus. It's not doing anything until you load something. Storage devices don't get polled every single frame, that would be absolutely ridiculous.   During the splashcreen, I had the largest amount of resources used the second the game was started. Afterwards, resource use dropped off and didn't reach the height they were. My framerates mimicked this, consistently.   When I tested it, I get 33% usage of CPU oddly enough, but no disk usage whatsoever until after the splashscreen finishes. This makes sense, because the source engine does not load anything until the splashscreen ends.  Also it seems that the intro vid is locked to 24fps, non fluxuating. So it looks like it's actually locked at rendering once per frame, not 40+ render frames for every single splashscreen frame like with Crysis. Which by the way lines up with the coil whining. The GPU doesn't make any sound in the HL2 splash due to only rendering a frame every 24 sec. In Crysis however it can be heard from across the room due to it rendering 1800-2400 times a second.    I took real quick showing the FPS I usually get in CSS.   Still, I maintain that that number is incorrect...   It's not incorrect, and you can prove it using a camera pointed at your monitor. As the image scans, the GPU keeps getting new frames WHILE the image is being displayed by the monitor. This is what tearing is. For 120fps on a 60hz monitor, you are getting 2 frames for every refresh. So on the monitor, if you turn suddenly, you get the top half as the first frame, and then the bottom half as the second frame. With 600-900 fps, you get about 10 frames on the screen at once, all torn up and divided as the monitor scans down. You can visibly see it even without a camera. It's not a myth and you can't just ignore facts because you don't believe them.   You're playing on a server hosted on your machine (ping: 0) and you're getting framerates jumping from 600-900. More players means more action. More action means slower framerates. The framerate that you can consistently get is lower than that of what you can always pull.   I get 600-900 so long as there's less than 10 people around. In my own testing actually, on servers with bigger maps (other gametypes) and 50 people I generally get 150-300 fps. When I played the same map locally I still only get around 200-350. 50 people + playing on the server does not affect your FPS that much. If you want to dispute that, you need to get proof and show me.   If your monitor has a refresh rate of 144hz, your monitor will be refreshing 144 times a second. Not 300. So, while extra frames will provide a smoother experience, it's not going to give you some grand edge.   I understand what you mean, but I'm not talking about a visual difference, which there is none. I'm talking about the input, your mouse movements. Due to the way the source engine calculates input from your mouse, having a higher framerate actually changes how your character moves and aims in the game. This is even apparent back in Quake. If you set your FPS higher in that game, you could actually run faster AND jump higher. This has been known for a very long time.   Back to the ""unplayable"" comment: If your monitor could refresh 1000 times a second, everything would be moving super fast. For a little taste of this, you can use an emulator (if you have one.) Simply remove framerate capping.   That's because emulators lock their game timings to the framerate. They're supposed to run at 24 or 20 or 30 fps - depending on the game. If you speed them up, the timing speeds up alongside the framerate.  This is not the case with the source engine. They are so vastly different it's not funny. If it was, you would run slower at 30fps, and then run faster at 60fps. That's just obviously not the case.  You can see a game that operates like this here. This is one of the only games I know past the year 1999 that runs with framerate dependent timings.   Also, you do realize that the ""render loop"" is on your harddrive, right?   No, that is not right. The render loop is the name given to the code that runs through your main rendering and input functions and then draws the frame at the end of the loop. Then, as the name suggests, it repeats. After it gets loaded off the Hard drive to the RAM, all of this code is run in the RAM from that point on.  I get a feeling that you might be just messing with me. I'm thoroughly enjoying this discussion though because I'm currently sick at home, so if you are genuinely just out of the loop then I'm happy to keep talking if you want."
HalfLife,3a196i,super6plx,0,Wed Jun 17 13:31:26 2015 UTC,"Well, I called BS and backed it up. FRAPS has always been crap. I didn't ignore it. I addressed it. Unlike you, who didn't address the harddrive comment.   You didn't back anything up, you just called it bad, said that my results didn't mean anything because fraps is bad, and left it there.   According to those tools, the Valve splashscreen has a frame-rate of 23.98    Video framerate =/= render loop framerate. the program measures renders, not frames in the video   These cutscenes ""confuse"" the program, making it give a larger output than what's there.   No, they don't. The program counts each time the game loop goes through a draw call. In the case of Crysis, the render loop is going at 1800-2200 fps. The video file itself is only roughly 30 or 60fps but the counter isn't reading that. It's reading how many times the render is called.   Here's a screenshot from a PC with no disk usage.   You know you can disconnect your main hard drive while your PC is idle and it will still work right? In fact in any Linux distro that doesn't do anything fancy while idling, you can actually format your main disk while running the OS and it will still run idle indefinitely until you try to do something that needs something off the disk.   Do you have a high speed camera? Cause', otherwise, you're getting 30 or 60 FPS from the camera.   That doesn't matter, you want to be taking a picture, not a video. If you take a picture half way through the monitor scan, it will show you all the points at which the image is tearing at that given moment. ANY camera will do. Framerate doesn't come into it for what I'm talking about.   LCD monitors redraw data all at once. CRTs redraw data from the top left, fading and moving.   No, LCD monitors scan top left to bottom right as well for legacy reasons. They don't just flash the whole thing at once. I have no idea where you get that idea, you must just be just assuming this like everything else.   It doesn't matter if you can flicker between 600 and 900, it matters what you can consistently get.   But I thought you can't possibly get 1,000fps because it'd require too much cooling. Maybe your previous idea of how this all worked was wrong.   Mouse movements are not tied to FPS, it's tied to polling rate, DPI and speed settings.   See that's what I'm trying to tell you. They actually are tied to FPS in a minor way. You don't get how the source engine works if you deny that. You try to tell a pro that his input doesn't change when going from 60fps to 300fps, even if he only has a 60hz monitor. Everyone ran 100fps configs in CS1.6 for this same reason. Framerate does affects input and control in source engine games, it always has.   That was quake. This is Counter Strike   ... which runs off a modified quake engine   bhopping requires you move at least 250 map units/s   No. You can bhop at any speed. You can stand still and jump and begin bhopping and gain momentum without ever using a movement key to run.   Movement speed is based off of Map units/s, not framerates   In source - yes. In quake - no. I was just using that as an example.   yet you're saying movement in counter strike is dependant on frames and is totally not a visual thing.   Actually Source can only send one network packet per frame, so if you just rendered a frame, and straight after you changed direction, you need to wait a full 17ms for the next render call before that movement change will go through to the server. If you run 300fps, the next render call is 3.33ms away tops.   They're supposed to run at 24 or 20 or 30 fps - depending on the game.  HEADDESK   Why are you headdesking? A lot of old games ran at 24/30/60fps etc and were locked at that framerate. If you sped them up, it would speed the entire game up. I'm talking snes, NES, atari, etc. Everything I said is correct, so why you're groaning at me is confusing.   This is not the case with the source engine.  sigh  They are so vastly different it's not funny.    Actually you'd be surprised, the traditional game loop has been used for so many years. In fact in the source engine (and cry-engine) you can lock the game speed to the framerate with a single command. You can test in half life 2 by typing host_framerate <x> (replacing <x> with a fps number) which causes the game speed to be linked to your framerate.   If it was, you would run slower at 30fps, and then run faster at 60fps. That's just obviously not the case. That's not how any of this works.   If you set host_framerate to 60 and you get 300 fps, the game starts going 5x faster. And if you lock it to 200fps but only get 45 fps, everything slows down."

HalfLife,39zqhj,Riomaki,0,Tue Jun 16 03:29:25 2015 UTC,No valve announcements then
HalfLife,39zqhj,Mr_honesty_,-1,Tue Jun 16 13:07:34 2015 UTC,"Not to imply that anything is going to happen, but with the amount of hype and expectation built up around Half-Life 3 at this point, it's probably reasonable to expect it in a suprise announcement. It'll be just like, from one day to the next; ""boom!"", there is Half-Life 3 and a trailer and a release date. I don't think we will be told in advance, or even warned about it.."

HalfLife,39zqhj,wondermite,9,Tue Jun 16 02:42:24 2015 UTC,"Too many big games coming out. Although, Half Life 2 was released the same year as Doom 3, it would be cool for Doom 4 to be released the same year as Half-Life 3."
HalfLife,39zqhj,kingkolton9,2,Tue Jun 16 03:16:10 2015 UTC,"Half Life 2 was released the same year as Doom 3   And WoW. And Painkiller, and Escape from Butcher Bay, and Far Cry, and Halo 2, and Killzone, and GTA:SA, and Battlefront, and Fable, and Sacred, and Sims 2. In terms of competing with other big title announcements, Battlefront 2, Doom 4, Fallout 4, and Last Guardian (apparently) (Shenmue doesn't count because it only just got kickstarted) would give HL3 an easy ride by comparison."

It's nice to hope though, in the back of my mind I'd love for it to be like this, but I also won't get too invested because it'll just end up being another let down."

HalfLife,3a07v2,enostress,3,Tue Jun 16 10:06:42 2015 UTC,"I was watching the streams last night and seen that xbox has teamed up with valve to use their VR set. So i'd imagine that valve will be there, showcasing source 2, the VR set, the controller, and a steam machine of some description. But, if they give a showcase of what the new engine is capable of, as they did when source 1 was announced, I'd say they will drop some hints. Showing that something of the world of half life, portal, or L4D. It may be small, but if it's there, someone will notice it."

HalfLife,39xiev,JohnFreemanWhoWas,4,Mon Jun 15 16:41:58 2015 UTC,Well they haven't announced they are going.  They could show up  like Gaben did at Sonys E3 2010 conference to announce Portal 2.   I doubt they will give any warning when they announce a new game.

HalfLife,39xiev,elwunderwalrus,2,Mon Jun 15 17:01:45 2015 UTC,We may not see it at E3 ever just because they kind of stopped going.
HalfLife,39xiev,bigmanmac14,3,Mon Jun 15 18:11:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah... to quote Star_:   Valve isn't really even a game company anymore. They're a hardware company now... like, they make controllers and Steam Boxes.   Which is fairly accurate, to be honest. Their last actual release was Portal 2 or CS:GO, right? Plus, almost all of the updates that have been released for their games (I'm speaking mainly about TF2, CS:GO, and DOTA 2) recently have been 99% community driven, like Black Mesa or End of the Line for TF2, and the updates for Team Fortress at least haven't really been well-received when Valve has stepped in to change things."
HalfLife,39xiev,elwunderwalrus,4,Mon Jun 15 19:26:07 2015 UTC,"If Valve was only making hardware, they wouldn't make Source 2.  ""B-But they're just doing that to improve Dota 2 and other games!""  No, a company doesn't make an ENTIRE NEW ENGINE just to update older games to it that could easily be improved via random system tweaks and content additions. Besides, the only games they would really be able to update are Dota 2 and TF2, CS:GO has to rely on a specially made custom engine (Source 1.5) to be able to play properly and have the same mechanics. And I doubt they are going to make a new engine just for two games.  Besides, Valve themselves said they aren't releasing any new games until Source 2 is made, which pretty much says that they are making new games."

HalfLife,39wvqi,peterkrull,14,Mon Jun 15 13:38:13 2015 UTC,"The problem I see with this theory is that they said they experimented with a Half-Life scenario before demonstrating the kit and went with the Portal demo instead.  I think they said something along the lines of ""it didn't work how we wanted it to."" I'd give source but I'm at work."
HalfLife,39wvqi,Empty_Allocution,8,Mon Jun 15 14:45:52 2015 UTC,"I've heard a similar story, that the demands of a game like Half-Life didn't lend themselves to VR technology very well.  Additionally, Valve has said that they don't intend for Half-Life 3 to be some kind of exclusive thing.  It wasn't going to be limited to the Steam Machines, and it probably wouldn't be limited to their Vive either.  Some people think that any game can magically work with VR - that you could add it to anything and it makes it that much better.  But, in reality, you have to design around VR.  And, in doing so, you're naturally going to make it less accessible for those who don't have it.  I don't believe this is something Valve wants to do."
HalfLife,39wvqi,Riomaki,5,Mon Jun 15 15:03:26 2015 UTC,"They might have went with portal because it would be easier to show without telling much story. It would also not stir as much attention. Just imagine if they showed a high quality Alyx. The world would implode. It could also just be that for what they wanted to show off, portal worked better. Also, they did not show any actual Portal gameplay using portals, which means that my ""why Half-life"" statement still holds true.  I don't want to believe that they scrapped HL3 because they could not get it to work with VR first try."

HalfLife,39wvqi,phipb,2,Mon Jun 15 18:34:27 2015 UTC,I think they might just make an entirely new game or like a short demo simply to showcase the VR technology and what it can do etc. I really doubt it would be HL3 right off the gate.
HalfLife,39wvqi,Japface,2,Mon Jun 15 16:43:22 2015 UTC,"I think the main hole in your theory is that valve devs have said vr and fps games don't work well together. Basically vr in its present form as valve has presented is more of a single room experience. This is something Chet from valve has stated as well. If half life 3 is around the corner I doubt it will be vr centric because of that. Gabe has also commented on the past that it would be silly to hold up a game like half life 3 (ricochet 2 as he called it) in development just to shoe horn vr. As much as we all want to believe, I think its just wishful thinking at this point."
HalfLife,39wvqi,indianajosh,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:37:50 2015 UTC,"I do think Valve are working on a game that will revolutionize the VR experience and drive demand for the Vive, but I don't think it's going to be Half-Life 3, or even a first-person shooter. The great thing about the Vive is that it lets the user move around in a limited space. Think about how much space a Half-Life game covers. If the user has to constantly be using the controls to navigate, it won't be the best way of showing off the Vive's capabilities. I think Valve would be better off developing a game that's based less on action and movement and more on exploration and puzzle-solving, and that's not Half-Life."
HalfLife,39wvqi,Aloysius722,0,Mon Jun 15 15:29:06 2015 UTC,"If valve is dependent on the ""room"" sized levels, it is very limited what they can do. Most games would feel the same then. The positional tracking of Vive is cool. But most gamers will probably sit down and game anyway. They should just find a way around the movement part."
HalfLife,39wvqi,EngineerDogIta,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:12:38 2015 UTC,"I think (as others have sort of said already) the type of gameplay we're used to in Half-Life games limits its application to VR without major changes to the formula - which fans would probably not like.   Things like how open the levels are etc. just can't work with VR locomotion as we currently have it. Unless they make some major breakthroughs in locomotion and allowing twitchy shooter-ness in VR, I can't see HL3 being in VR for some time (if at all). Also, if they have made some big breakthrough, that directly contradicts what Chet Faliszek has said about how much they know about VR development...."

More likely, it will be something like ""We added more hats to DOTA2!""  And, of course, trying to promote Steam Machines and the HTC Vive, possibly with hands-on demonstrations of the stuff we saw at GDC.  Possibly the announcement of yet another initiative that won't go anywhere.  Course, considering Fallout 4, I don't envy even Valve trying to follow that act.  In recent years, I've set my expectations very low for them.  It's a far more conservative company than a lot of people think.  And yet, even those expectations were too much to ask for.  So, I honestly don't expect much."

I mean, you have a base (a huge one) of faithful followers that have begging for it for upwards of a decade...and they're begging to give you money hand over foot.   Like does the metric of their income work out such that they can really justify saying 'nah....2 have bigger fish to go after than HL3'... like CS:GO?

If they just go out and make a game that they didn't put their all into (which will happen if they just try to make a game willy nilly without actually wanting to make it) then they stand to lose their reputation and potentially a lot of sales in the future. It won't be representative of their true talent, it will just be a game that they made because everyone asked them to. You have to want to make something to make it great.  That being said, it's not likely that they just don't WANT to make the next game, it's probably that nothing is catching their interest at the moment. They said they don't want to make another ""classic"" style linear game, and I'm all for that."

HalfLife,39twdc,morphic-monkey,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:05:40 2015 UTC,"If they announce Half-Life 3 it's going to be at The International. It will have over 1 million viewers who are all Valve fans, and that's not counting China, which will probably add 1-2 million more viewers. That's also not counting the viewers on ESPN, and those alone would give it far more viewership than E3. Announcing such an anticipated game is a critical step in the marketing campaign and they want as many people as possible to see the announcement live, and The International, a tournament with a prize pool that will probably reach 16-18 million dollars, is definitely the best place to do that."
HalfLife,39twdc,ethosaur,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:00:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sorry. We hear the same thing every year. I feel as though people aren't paying attention to what Gabe has said previously; I think he's been pretty clear as to why Valve haven't discussed active Half-Life development at this point in time (especially in light of their experience with the HL2 leak incident).  Beyond this, it's just a question of patience and, as always, enjoying the many other fruits of the industry that are out there. :-)"

What you've said here is, essentially ""Fuck the viewers. To hell with the norms that are created in film for a reason, I like 15 degrees.""   You've seem to picked random camera angles in the video. It's as if you don't understand the basic concepts of film. It's actually kind of painful to watch. You're not supposed to shove the camera in the corner of a room unless you're showing an action being done. It's supposed to be more than talking or walking. Cuts within the same scene are supposed to have the camera relatively close to its former position.   This is not avant garde. This is just poor attitude."

HalfLife,39qi14,Riomaki,13,Sun Jun 14 16:34:10 2015 UTC,"Eh.  It's kind of a shame that he spends 12 minutes of the video whinging at the story.  I know a lot of people play Half-Life for the story, but I never thought the story itself was revolutionary, rather, the innovation was the way it was told.  Yeah, a lot of Half-Life 2's story doesn't stand up to scrutiny.  Yes, the chapters do feel cobbled together in the ""Now it's survival horror town, now it's vehicle time, now it's prison time"" sense.  It's all a bit disorganized.  I think, if we're honest, we have to admit that the original ending really sucks.  I mean it.  It's one of the worst endings I've ever seen in a game that spent so much time building a narrative and making us watch several minutes of unskippable talkie bits.  And yes, Half-Life 1 makes more sense from a narrative standpoint.  It feels like it was more planned from beginning to end, whereas Half-Life 2 has many jarring transitions in tone.  But all that said, that's the story.  I could take or leave that.  The gameplay is the meat and potatoes here and I feel his criticism came up desperately short on that front.  He says he didn't like the Gravity Gun and the Crowbar didn't have heft... and then he kind of gravitated back to whinging about the story again.  I mean, I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I think he was trying to make the argument that the game felt designed from the standpoint of ""Look at what we can do!"" rather than trying to make a cohesive experience.  This is something that Yahtzee touched on and and that's sometimes true, let's face it.  I'm sure it was.  There are only so many times you can do a counterbalance puzzle with your Gravity Gun before it feels like busy work.  And while the game presents a lot of ideas, it sometimes gets carried away with them - did we really need three turret standoffs in Entanglement?  Did Highway 17 really need to continue beyond the bridge segment?  Things like that.  But that's not inherently a bad thing.  By not providing any specific examples, his criticisms of gameplay are quite vague, and then he goes on this bizarre tangent of Valve being jealous of id's Quake engine.  Yeah, not sure that was Valve's guiding design principle, buddy.  tl;dr: If you're going to go out and say ""Half-Life 2 sucks,"" (a claim he sheepishly walks back by the end of the video) you can't just say ""I didn't like the story."""
HalfLife,39qi14,TheScyphozoa,6,Sat Jun 13 22:23:24 2015 UTC,"I think, if we're honest, we have to admit that the original ending really sucks. I mean it. It's one of the worst endings I've ever seen in a game that spent so much time building a narrative and making us watch several minutes of unskippable talkie bits.   Um...why?"
HalfLife,39qi14,Riomaki,6,Sun Jun 14 02:14:04 2015 UTC,"Because, in the absence of the Episodes, absolutely nothing is resolved.  All these characters you were led to care about, the fate of the resistance, saving Eli, saving Alyx... it's all for naught.  You don't even know if Breen is well and truly dead.  The G-Man just pulls the plug and we're done.  It makes the narrative up until that point feel like a waste of time.  We keep building toward something that never happens.  It's easy with Episodes One and Two to forget how awful the original ending was, because now we know the story does, in fact, continue.  But picture yourself back in 2004, with just Half-Life 2 and no Episodes at all.  Is that ending really worth the 10+ hours it took to get there?  Does it provide any kind of satisfying closure?  Or is it, as the G-Man plainly states, an arbitrary imposition?"
HalfLife,39qi14,TheScyphozoa,6,Sun Jun 14 02:50:26 2015 UTC,How is that any different from killing the Nihilanth and not knowing what's going on back on Earth?  Both of which I thought were fine.
HalfLife,39qi14,Riomaki,3,Sun Jun 14 02:55:23 2015 UTC,"The ending to Half-Life 1 works better for a couple reasons.  One, your trip to Xen is something of a suicide mission.  It's established before going to Xen that killing the Nihilanth will shut the portal, but by that logic, you know you probably aren't coming back.  This is also evidenced by all the dead explorers you find on the way to him.  It's reasonable to conclude that, as a result of your actions, you've ended the Black Mesa incident and stopped the aliens.  Of course, we know this led to the Combine invasion, but if we took Half-Life 1 by itself, ""saving the world"" is a reasonable assumption, even if we never got to see it.  And two, this was the first time you had a ""heart-to-heart"" with the G-Man.  Until that point, he was nothing more than a shadowy guy who you saw periodically.  Now you find out what he's about and what he was doing there, so that's a reward in-and-of itself.  In Half-Life 2's ending, all we know is that we've caused one enormous explosion at the Citadel.  Alyx even looks like she's done for.  We have no idea if this stopped the Combine or not.  The G-Man, quite literally, presses the pause button on the story and leaves you hanging."
HalfLife,39qi14,TroubledPCNoob,3,Sun Jun 14 15:21:54 2015 UTC,"However, you DO know that Breen died because of the explosion and he slowly says ""You need me"" before he dies. We know we slowed the combine because you see the portal opening as a result of what Breen is doing. As you kill him, the whole portal disappears. If you pay attention you can see that the ending isn't really that much of a cliff hanger. That's why I think the ending works well, if you look closely at the sky you can see how the portal closes and as itself it does stand up well. Because if they made no more episodes, you could just assume that you saved the world and the Combine isn't going to come back. But yes, the episodes do add more to the story, I won't disagree with you there.  And you know why the Gman pulls you out, it's because he wants to satisfy his ""employers"" and use you later. And it doesn't make the story flimsy because you know that when you die it matters as it's not like every time you die the Gman says ""Oh I'll put you back here"" as a reason for loading back saves :)."
HalfLife,39qi14,Maxahoy,3,Sun Jun 14 18:36:07 2015 UTC,"The ending to half life 1 leaves you surprised and possibly a little irritated that you're talked by the alien dude you kept seeing periodically, who you later come to know as G-Man. The ending to half life 2 is deus ex machina; he literally comes out of nowhere and says, ""OK Gordon, nice job, now back into my little toybox you go."" It's better when you add episode 1, and I'm sure it was a cliffhanger at the time, but looking back, I want a more conclusive ending."

Not that this video is a great example, mind you."
HalfLife,39qi14,kingkolton9,7,Sat Jun 13 23:43:30 2015 UTC,"Half Life 2 does have fault. However, this review is just...bad. That's why its cringey."
HalfLife,39qi14,MadPilotMurdock,0,Sun Jun 14 01:20:22 2015 UTC,Does it really make you that uncomfortable to hear someone's opinion?
HalfLife,39qi14,NeutronMinister,12,Sat Jun 13 23:18:04 2015 UTC,"All his opinions are proving is that he did little more than glance at the game, his points aren't valid."
HalfLife,39qi14,Fever308,5,Sat Jun 13 23:31:39 2015 UTC,"He seems overly fixated on the 'Gordon is treated as a messiah' thing which I've never had a problem with myself.  Gordon achieved this reputation during Black Mesa, as you progress through the game it becomes apparent to the scientists that you are the only person tenacious enough to put up a fight against the invaders, similarly Gordon gathers a reputation among the military as the thorn in their side. As you progress through the game and encounter your fellow scientists it becomes clear that you are no longer just another employee fighting for survival but are now the centre of attention for all factions involved. So it's natural to assume that in the interval between HL1 and HL2 knowledge of Gordon's role in the incident would have spread among the populace thanks to the testimony of the Black Mesa survivors and the vortigaunts.   He (and several other people who have espoused this view) have misunderstood the plot of Half-Life, which was not just about Gordon trying to survive.  Another thing he dislikes is the sheer amount of Black Mesa survivors in one place, again this makes sense. There are only 5 known survivors of Black Mesa in the game, hardly a large number. And it's natural to assume they hang out in City 17 because that's the control centre for Combine operations on Earth.  I don't know what I can say about his complaints about the silent protagonist, it worked for me but not for him.  Some people may not like the ending and I see why, but it's not a deus ex machina, if G-Man had appeared and punched Dr Breen in the face then it would have been. However it was perfectly in keeping with what we've seen G-Man do before and his enigmatic, amoral character.   His anger at Valve for apparently holding back material for the episodes is entirely unfounded as they did not have them planned out during the development of Half life 2.  He gets a number of facts wrong, such as calling the Hazard Suit the Nano Suit. He was obviously thinking of Crysis. Although this is not that big of a mistake he makes a number of these throughout and it makes him look a little unprofessional.  He claims the game was remade after the leak of 2003 but this is untrue. Search for interviews with Marc Laidlaw and Gabe Newell about the cut content, they will tell you it was cut because it wasn't working well. I am always confused when people talk about this 'darker' Half Life alpha as if the one-dimensional characters, overlong and emotionally uninvolving  storyline of the Alpha would have made the game 10 times better. Take the infamous 'Hydra' for example, it looks very cool in that 10 second clip of it we've all seen but it didn't play very well so they removed it.   I disagree with the notion that the game is cobbled-together, of course they want to show off their engine, iI think we can forgive Valve for sticking in a few seesaw puzzles if it means we get a kickass game?  I think calling the game not well-planned is quite insulting to those who worked on it. Valve are meticulous in their craft of making sure their games are the best they can be."

HalfLife,39qi14,SvmJMPR,4,Sat Jun 13 22:06:58 2015 UTC,"People knew who Gordon Freeman was before he even stepped off the train. Well, not citizens, but anyone in the resistance. The resistance is headed by Black Mesa employs and they told everyone of Freeman's heroic actions.  Hell, even the citizens might know. The reason they don't recognize him is because they never knew what he looked like."
HalfLife,39qi14,Riomaki,3,Sun Jun 14 01:40:58 2015 UTC,"I saw the whole video, and I disagree with everything he said about the story. But he had a few reasonable points, I kinda agree that the game was kinda limited by the source engine in some areas that just felt that shouldn't be limited this way. Like the Airboat and driving levels where limited by the small maps as in you where temporarily cut away from the action by the Loadings. It wasn't the same argument he gave, but it was a little tedious to stay on track on the action without being interrupted.   Also, he mentions about how Gordon was treated as the savior, and they all knew. I never actually thought about that, can someone explain how they all knew, or how the news spread?"
HalfLife,39qi14,Sigma1977,3,Sun Jun 14 01:15:48 2015 UTC,"They didn't know Gordon from Adam when he stepped off the train.  It's not until you meet Kleiner that the savior thing comes into play, and that's reasonable since he's one of the leaders of the resistance."
HalfLife,39qi14,Vrabo,3,Sun Jun 14 15:37:59 2015 UTC,Judging a 2004 game by 2015 standards. Clearly he was not there at the time to gaze in wonder at the plaza when the train station doors opened.  Like many before him he forgets that many of the games that have surpassed HL2 exist because of HL2.  The funniest thing is none of these contemporary reviews were around to remember the real problem with HL2 on release - that being the downloading problems with a Steam still in it's infancy.

I'm really tired right now and don't feel like listing all of them right now but the last major thing was how he said the game was scrapped because of the leak and how it was almost completed. The game was being changed to how it is now since before the leak. Most everything in the leak was closer to current HL2."

At E3, Gabe announced that Portal 2 would be coming to PS3, which was a pretty big deal back then.  Anything could happen but after being burnt through expectation for the last ~8 years, I am going to sit this one out.  EDIT: Not sure why this was downvoted because this is what happened."

HalfLife,39qorl,Trenchman,6,Sat Jun 13 21:00:05 2015 UTC,"They did announce it; it was very, very far from a surprise. They stated, at one point, that their E3 demo had been cancelled in favor of a surprise. Initial speculation was, of course, centered on the possibility that EP3 would be that surprise. Gabe debunked that notion at some point.  Him being on stage at Sony's presser was a surprise, but to answer your question: no, they had announced an E3 presence and everyone knew they would be there."
HalfLife,39qorl,ispeelgood,7,Sun Jun 14 00:41:05 2015 UTC,I don't understand why this was down voted? Do people want to see hl3 at e3 so much they ignore facts?

HalfLife,39pb1w,Barney99x,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:40:09 2015 UTC,"Great game! Tons of fun, very creative. The reason you won't find this on Steam is because Rewolf software doesn't exist anymore.

They think it's a dead series most likely. I don't think announcing XCOM 2/new Deus Ex at E3 would make any difference either. Publishers are just starting to realize that announcing shit at E3 or other places is pointless now or releasing trailers or whatever.   Source Engine 2 is now available   Doesn't really matter because it's pretty new I'd imagine. Probably won't release a real game for it any time soon.

HalfLife,39q43e,_FRANKENSTEIN_,5,Sat Jun 13 19:16:54 2015 UTC,DOTA 2 has had it's core structure slowly updated over the last 6+ months. They've kind of slowly applied Source 2 to it.   How much of the old source will be left is anyone's guess.

But yeah, HL:S has many glitches, (just search up ""half life source bugs"" on YouTube) and while the game is playable, (Freeman's Mind, at least most of it, was done on HL:S rather than the Goldsrc version) many of the bugs are graphical, like shining your flashlight on a reflecting surface will make it just blank white, and many animations don't work properly. Also the hands on the pistol are red instead of orange.  The worst part of it is they broke custom skins. Being on the source engine means many more things can be brought to an ""HD"" standard, but now with missing textures, and even more animation errors when it's using custom content.   the custom content issue is terrible, especially when great efforts were made to get it on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HafcoaXgEa0 level before Valve broke it.  EDIT: I could install some of the old HD packs and upload a video to show just how bad it is, maybe with enough sharing, the community/valve will fix it, either the game or the HD pack. Whenever I contact the people who originally made the HD pack, and ask what happened to it, the general response is ""just buy Black Mesa"""

Cough Not saying I support piracy. Just saying that since you already own the game it might be worth a shot.  Edit: Just a tip for this part, specifically on Source. Get your shotgun or .357 out and crouch when the large doors open. Then, put your back to the left side of the door way. Move until the soldier on the right is just in view, and kill him. The one on the left won't attack you. Move out and kill him. The other Marines will come marching in, so quickly move against the right wall of the Mesa. Take out your crossbow; they'll practically line up for you."

HalfLife,39nhnb,MrBarrelrolll,8,Sat Jun 13 00:29:54 2015 UTC,"The Vive system will not be locked down to Steam but I can see it only supporting the SteamVR and OPenVR platforms initially. They really want Lighthouse to be supported by everybody.   Game wise I think we're going to get an Orange Box 2 type package.  Here for a while after watching the recent Chet Faliszek VR and Story Telling talks, I seriously doubted Half-life 3 would support VR because he makes it sound like they have no idea how to make a game in VR since it’s so new. But your post got me thinking, Valve's original VR room we saw was full of QR codes plastered all over the walls for inside out tracking, but it was room scale tracking. So if Valve right then and there decided to include VR in their Source 2 games and design everything around room scale tracking then they've already had a 2 and half year head start on doing so.     Half-life 3 and Left 4 Dead 3 will both have co-op and support some VR type gameplay but will primarily be designed to be played with the Steam Controller (and support PS4\XBone). The majority of the VR content will be a physics playground set in Portal's universe. It'll utilize content from all of the Source 2 games and just be like Garry's Mod but on crack. They want tons of user generated content so they can collect that sweet sweet mods money.    TF2, CSGO, and Dota 2 will all receive Source 2 updates but I don't think they'll get true sequels like HL3 and L4D3. Portal 3 won't be like the traditional Portal 1 and 2 games, it'll be much slower and you won't be flying around like a maniac. However I don't see a problem with using the Portal gun for puzzles so I think it’ll still play a vital role in gameplay. I doubt they'll make a full-fledged sequel though, instead it'll just be something like 'Aperture Science Open Testing Initiative' which is just a sandbox w/ paid mods support. It'll have several test chambers to show everyone the ropes but after that they want the users generating content.    Looking further down the road I see Valve getting into hardware fabrication more and more.  I’ve read they have a very advanced 3D printing\fabrication facility, so I can see them expanding upon that and automating it for the masses. They want to turn it into a real life steam workshop. Fabricate your own custom Lighthouse controllers, headsets, whatever and utilize it in their sandbox world. Want a 1:1 scale Gravity Gun or Portal Gun with Lighthouse sensors? Go browse their real world workshop and order one that someone previously had already designed and uploaded.  They’ll get a cut of the order and Valve will handle the rest. The potential for custom input devices alone would make the whole thing successful."
HalfLife,39rdr8,SCREAM2NIGHT,5,Sun Jun 14 00:36:15 2015 UTC,"Actually. I was thinking about E3 of 97. That was the year they first announced Half-Life. Steam Sale is happening during E3 which is the first time ever to my knowledge and I looked back a few years.  There are a lot of signs pointing to Half-Life 3 right now.  We have three games that may be coming here. https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/38sjrq/could_someone_prove_this_wrong_email_leak_about/  I think that CS:GoU is actually just an update to CS:GO like how Dota 2 is being called Reborn.  There are 3 zombies in the mini game that have headcrabs named Crabbie, Alyx and Chell. Also there is another that is named city_destroyed_12.  I heard they will be talking a lot about Source 2 next week whether that be at E3 or not I don't know.

HalfLife,39jomj,aprofondir,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:58:32 2015 UTC,Maybe it was a part of the suit. And Gordon has a different version of the HEV suit in HL2 so it checks out.

HalfLife,39jtcx,HyvelTjuven,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:01:02 2015 UTC,"The bad part is I think it was probably a glitch on Valve's end.  At least as far as Black Mesa, Mirror's Edge and the Carpe Fulgar collection were concerned, everything seemed to have double the discount that evening compared to in the morning.  So either three completely different companies had second thoughts about their discount, or the wrong discount was deployed.  Either way, if it was Valve's fault, the proper thing to do would be to refund that portion of the money.  But they won't, so that's what the return process is for, I guess.  Especially if you're close to the time when the deals change, it pays to be careful.  Sometimes discounts don't take effect right away, even during normal sales."
HalfLife,39jtcx,Riomaki,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:09:04 2015 UTC,"...Sorry everyone, though I did say in the comments that it may go on sale for less. If you spent more than 2 hours, you can still request a refund."

What a twist it would be that Gordon Freeman actually became a crazed Aperture scientist and the Combine find a way to infiltrate Aperture, with him having to shoot his way out of the Aperture facility. Maybe GLADoS even helps him escape and kill the Combine too. Curious about if Chell and the portal gun should be used at all in the game or if a separate game (Portal 3) should be released to tie together the two timelines for good."

HalfLife,39cjq8,teuast,15,Fri Jun 12 10:07:27 2015 UTC,"At least 1 citizen killed for resisting CP, dozens more probably punished and shipped off to Nova-Prospect   That one citizen was a member of the railroad. It was going to happen, most likely.   If you count in all burnt corpses in drainage tunnels (that must have been to railroad rebels) and people actually seen killed, then from 15 to 25 people were killed during Gordon's escape, not even counting discovery and destruction of probably the only route out of the city   Burnt corpses weren't directly from Freeman actions. They were there before, considering the places some of them are in. If the Combine found out about the railroad earlier, the rest would have died, anyway.   Large, but unknown number of rebels and refugees   And Dr. Freeman was at fault here, how? I mean, he didn't choose to come out of stasis, he didn't choose to go to Black Mesa East (Barney, Kleiner, Alyx and Eli sent him), and Breed admitted that they could have done it at any time.   A lot of time later, Gordon arrives to Depot, which holds unspecified number of people in stasis pods   They were going to be turned to stalkers, anyway.   Same scenario repeats in Citadel - it also had similar stasis pod facility, and if combine didn't evacuate all captives out of building before its destruction, then they were definitely killed   Stalkers and High-ranking soldiers are in the citadel. Not humans and captives. And, the Citadel needed to fall for the resistance to continue. There was no alternative. Actually, it wouldn't have exploded completely if the combine didn't purposefully destroy the reactor."

HalfLife,39cjq8,BladeRegalia,5,Wed Jun 10 21:31:20 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, uprising was meant to happen with Freeman or without him. They just needed an impulse to do it. Destruction of Nova Prospect was one such push to start it. Also, it was kinda intentional, as I believe it was carefully orchestred operation, though there are nothing to support this claim, so it remains my personnal thought. About people still left in city during explosion - that could be their own failure, as it was clear that citadel is going to blow soon (all the lighting and explosions around it, Kleiner using Breencast to inform everyone about it...). If they failed to reach train on time, then Gordon is not responsible."

HalfLife,399cy0,MarshManOriginal,11,Wed Jun 10 17:20:56 2015 UTC,"Blue Shift gets a bad reputation for being inferior to Opposing Force, which came before it and featured a ton of new content, whereas Blue Shift rehashed the existing mechanics and didn't introduce anything new.  That said, Blue Shift was nothing if not consistent.  I liked how it reflected the early to midgame of HL1, instead of loading the player up with all kinds of superweapons.  It retains the feel that you're just a lowly security guard scrounging around for leftovers on your quest to escape and stay one step ahead of the HECU."
HalfLife,399cy0,Riomaki,8,Wed Jun 10 19:00:45 2015 UTC,"I actually played Blue Shift first, then Opposing Force, and then Half-Life. So I saw the events of Half-Life unfolding through the eyes of side characters first, which made me appreciate the full experience of Half-Life even more when I finally got to it."
HalfLife,399cy0,SpaceNinjaBear,3,Wed Jun 10 19:39:26 2015 UTC,"It's was okay.  There isn't any one thing wrong with it.  It's just not as fun as the other games.  Opposing Force, I consider to be the best of the original games.  Gearbox simply did more with the level design than Valve did.  The level design was always changing, and you were never in one area for too long.  There were also a lot more scripted events and things going on than than HL1 had.  Opposing Force never has any ""aw, not this part"" moments when I play it.  Blue Shift feels exactly like what it was designed to be:  a reason for Half-Life fans to buy the game for Dreamcast.  It clearly didn't get the same amount of love that Opposing Force did.  The level design is very, very bland.  Calhoun never goes anywhere interesting.  In fact, most of the level design is centered around you backtracking.  When do you ever backtrack in a Half-Life game?  It gets boring very fast.  Where it does differ, however, is that you actually aren't escaping alone.  There are several scientists with you.  But just when that starts to get interesting, the game freaking ends.  There are also some gameplay issues I have as well.  For instance, they level designers seemed to go crazy with the surprise monster spawning.  Everywhere you go, especially in the later levels, monsters spawn right in your face... not very fun.  I don't hate the game.  The idea of playing as a security guard is still very cool.  I also really liked exploring Black Mesa as another employee.  But once the game actually gets rolling, there isn't much excitement.  Luckily, you can probably beat the damn thing in under two hours if you know what you're doing, so it isn't like it's a chore.  It's just a C average game.  Nothing spectacular, but just interesting enough that you're not disappointed you played it."

Bill Wilson was the agent appointed to supervise the operation. In addition to Pavel, Barsad gave him three hooded prisoners whom he claimed were working for the ""masked man"", but were in fact Bane himself and two hired guns. Bane's plan was to find out how much Pavel had told the CIA about them and to fake the scientist's death while on board their flight and then crash the plane with no survivors. To that end a plane full of mercenaries secretly tailed the CIA plane whilst airborne. Wilson tried to interrogate his prisoners about Bane, by pretending to shoot whoever remained silent before throwing them out of the plane so that they would be intimidated, but he was unsuccessful. Bane revealed his presence, and pointed out that their attempts wouldn't work because the hooded men had no reason to give in when the CIA operative was only putting on a show. He also told Wilson of his plan as the agent removed Bane's hood, knowing that they would not survive the attack, and broke free of the restraints just as more of the mercenaries arrived from the other plane to shoot the CIA personnel. In addition, the mercenaries brought in a cadaver to transfer Pavel's blood to fake the latter's death. Bane proceeded to attack Wilson, and left him on board the plane as it fell to the ground, most likely killing him.

HalfLife,39859r,TroubledPCNoob,9,Tue Jun 9 23:09:23 2015 UTC,"I was reading and thinking today of ways they could amaze us. I mean, I've been replaying HL2 and its episodes and while graphically, I still believe they're astoundingly great and perfectly on-par with some of today's games, I'm thinking there's not a lot of things they could do to really WOW!-factor the shit out of us right now.  Enemies in the snow? Dead Space 3 did that already.  Advisors? The psychic shields they were gonna use in EP2 don't seem really exciting now, maybe in 2007 it would've been the bomb. I mean, we know the plot in HL3. Get to the Borealis in the snow (which sounded good then but again, they shoe-boxed themselves, which is something they actually addressed with the EP2 trailer at the end of EP1, which ended being radically different), get to Mossman, and either destroy or harness the power in the Borealis. Then either get to the Combine universe and destroy them at their core (EP3 concept arts).   That's why Gabe said: ""The only reason we'd go back and do like a super classic kind of product is if a whole bunch of people just internally at Valve said they wanted to do it and had a reasonable explanation for why they did"" which means that they'd only do a classic, linear kind of game again if the team had something REALLY fucking cool to show to the world like they did with HL1 and HL2.   And the JIRA leaks show that, they've been working on HL3, and maybe they are or maybe they're not yet at that point where they've got really something epic to showcase with HL3.   So while you can be 100% sure it's being worked on, we can never put a definite date on when. We've waited 8 years now. And I'd say I wouldn't expect it earlier than mid 2016."
HalfLife,39859r,lemotif,5,Tue Jun 9 23:59:55 2015 UTC,"Two things I'd say to this.  One is that I'm not looking to be ""blown away"" by the next Half-Life game.  Despite what Valve says, it doesn't need to have a revolutionary new mechanic.  The irony is that 10 years after the fact, so few FPS games have followed in HL2's footsteps.  Instead, they took after Call of Duty with very short, extremely linear and aggressively scripted campaigns with little to no replayability.  And forget about mod support.  The fact is, if you took the core gameplay of HL2 and built a new game with it, it would still stand out simply because the bar for everything else got so much lower.  Two, I do fear that Valve's real problem with HL3 is that they can't figure out how to monetize it like a F2P mobile game."
HalfLife,39859r,Riomaki,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:52:39 2015 UTC,"It's not that they can't figure it out, it's that they don't have much of a reason to worry about an HL3.  They realized a long time ago that there's a lot more money in games like TF2, Counter-Strike, and DoTA if they monetize them properly.  Is it really a coincidence that DoTA 2 and CS:GO came out within a year of each other?  The two most popular eSports games in their respective genres?  They'll return to it when they feel like it.  Figuring out how to implement a a longer-lasting HL3 isn't that difficult, at least not taking 8 years difficult."
HalfLife,39859r,bothanspy1337,4,Wed Jun 10 21:23:18 2015 UTC,"But what if they DO have something amazing to show us again? We don't know the exact story of Half Life after all. We don't know exactly what or who the Gman is. We've seen his power to pluck you out of an explosion at the top of the Citadel. We don't know everything about the vortigaunts with their power to block the Gman from Gordon. We don't know entirely about the combine's power or any other combine things. We have a slice of their actual power. They took over Earth and defeated ALL of Earth's armies in 7 hours...   The reason why the resistance wasn't destroyed as quickly as Earth's armies was because they weren't expecting it and their wasn't a portal opening to go through easily I believe. We also don't know what is exactly in the Borealis. We know ofcourse it has something to do with teleportation, but why would the combine or resistance want a single ship? It shouldn't be so important to them other than just a way to bring back more combine forces. We are never truly told what they'd use it for if they got a hold of it or what the resistance would do with it.  The advisors were getting used to Earth's environment and had just gotten used to it at the end of Episode 1 and at the start of EP2. So we probably haven't seen the actual extent of their psychic abilities. Also Dead Space 3 was a linear cash grab game really that EA did. It had none of the horror that the older games had in the series. It was just a shootemup at that point and I think Valve would do a better ""snow game"". But back on topic, we may know bits of the story but we don't know the whole story. Also, just hearing a story isn't as fun as actually playing the game. Also what if the engine is also something REALLY fucking cool they have to show the world.   Valve also said they'd want to have a game to show the new engine off on and with every new engine release they've done the first game is usually a Half Life game. So I really believe we will soon, even if it takes a million years. See HL3 or atleast a new valve game  (New Valve game will take 3 years as a minimum :D)"
HalfLife,39859r,lemotif,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:23:10 2015 UTC,"While I agree with a lot of what you said, most of those story points have been already laid down in Laidlaw's head and in the writer's room.   The point I'm trying to put across is that they may or may not currently have the revolutionary mechanic that makes the game truly epic, like HL1 with the first-of-its-kind seamless storytelling aspect and HL2 and the episodes did with the Source physics engine used to its full extent, and that's why we've been waiting so long.   That's what Gabe means when he says they won't go back to make just a simple game unless they have something EXTREMELY good, like for example F-Stop, which we don't know what it is but was great enough to turn heads at Valve.   They certainly can't depend on stuff like VR, because, at its core, any HL game will be just that, a computer game. So we'll just have to wait and see what they come up with next."

HalfLife,39859r,Sitruckram,2,Thu Jun 11 15:18:00 2015 UTC,"I remember that HL2 raised the bar so much, it forced almost everyone to go out and upgrade their PCs.  That's how much of a WOW factor it had for us.  Doom 3 was completely eclipsed by the release of HL2.  The physics, storytelling, lighting, graphics, ability to tweak/mod/create using source.  The launch of HL2 meant a lot of things:  Using Steam as a viable platform (I know it existed slightly before HL2), it gave people easy to understand tools to create, it got people into gaming on PC exclusively.    Who cares if Dead Space 3 had enemies in the snow?  Games did it before Dead Space 3 did, and it didn't detract from anything.      I believe that Valve could WOW us again by once again raising the bar on how developing a game and engine that could be smooth, beautiful, easy to use/learn, and make us immersed, just like they've already done in the past.  It doesn't have to be completely different to be impressive.  It just has to be a step in the right direction."

Those companies don't need to do that anymore. Once the engine becomes ubiquitous they don't need to put so much effort into making a video game.  Half Life was when they were a video game company, Half Life 2 was half way between a necessary source of income and a tech demo.  I think there are still advancements to be made in the raw story telling aspect. Look at spec-ops the line. Nothing interesting in terms of gameplay mechanics, but how they used existing mechanics in incredible ways to tell a story was really groundbreaking for video games.  There is a distant chance they might have something to release to sell steam boxes and controllers. But barring that, I am giving up hope after this holiday season."

Then it goes over things to do to check and see if any AR type activities were introduced into the game.  Once the person has completed a cursory overview of what was updated, they can come share the update with us. Especially if questions are present.  This way, if there is an update that is related to future developments of the Half-Life/Portal universe, someone has had an objective review of them before they do a brain dump. If there's something there, we all share in the glee. If not, we've learned not to worry, and we've put the folks eager to dig into things to work, so they feel like they're contributing."

Half-Life  Then, if you want to know more about what happened during Half-Life, play Half-Life: Opposing Force and/or Half-Life: Blue Shift, which tell the events of Half-Life from the perspective of other characters. These are by no means essential, you can safely move on with enough knowledge of the story without playing them.  2. Half-Life 2  3. Half-Life 2: Episode 1  4. Half-Life 2: Episode 2  If you crave more Half-Life, you can play Black Mesa, which is a fan remake of the 1998 Half-Life with 2015 graphics and physics. At any point in the series- before, during or after- you can then play Portal and Portal 2. These games are very different from Half-Life, but they're set in the same universe and add a lot to the story."

HalfLife,38x7dt,Ortlas,7,Sun Jun 7 19:00:40 2015 UTC,Yeah the beginning of the game doesn't look that different but later on the lighting and skyboxes are very nice

Enhanced steam gets these stats off steamspy.com. For some reason HL2 didnt show the stats on its steam page so I had to dug them up manually. Basically you can change the number in url to steam APP ID to check another game. Or just use the search function."

Fan made, but feels just as authentic as the rest. Has been worked on for more than a decade, so this is huge.) (Don't play it before trying the original Half-Life, but once you have, you MUST play Black Mesa because it's awesome.) Portal (not a Half-Life game per se, but it's part of the culture and is officially related to it) Portal 2   Spin-off: Portal is a ""spin-off"", the game references Half-Life and is set in the same universe, though has a new, different vibe, and the gameplay is awesome.  Easter eggs and fun facts: All of the games are full of little funny silly things which I love. There are many hidden locations, dialogs, and events you may witness only if you're curious enough to do certain things that aren't necessary for completing the game. In Portal, there are even more easter eggs which I wouldn't even call 'easter eggs' as they form such an important part of the story. Of course you can find everything about these online but it's only fun if you find them yourself!"

HalfLife,38x7dt,vakomatic,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:10:58 2015 UTC,"I like all of the HD models except for the Beretta and the M4. Gordon is much more badass with a Glock and SMG. I would definitely recommend the originals to a new player, however."
HalfLife,38x7dt,LOCKJAWVENOM,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:45:14 2015 UTC,"Personally, I feel like all the HD models are just so enormous and chunky, they just don't look right. Same for all the character models, they just don't have that same sleekness like the original models do. HL's artstyle is to keep characters looking gaunt and slender. The HD pack just added 60 pounds to everything, and just made all the characters have so much more girth."
HalfLife,38x7dt,vakomatic,0,Thu Jun 11 00:22:38 2015 UTC,"I'll have to respectfully disagree then. I think the characters only look gaunt because of low poly count. I think the HD pack did a good job of fleshing the characters out a bit. If anything, what makes it look weird is the fact that the world textures don't get an upgrade which makes the character models look a tad off. Otherwise, I think the character models were an improvement. I will agree that some of the guns look a bit toyish, but otherwise they don't look that bad."

I know plenty of people who skipped over the events of the first game and still caught onto Half-Life 2 almost immediately.  The events of Portal take place before the events of Black Mesa, and the events of Portal 2 take place many years after Half-Life 2: Episode 2. The Portal series is optional and is unreferenced until Half-Life 2: Episode 2.  There are a couple of other games made by Gearbox Studios that take place during Black Mesa. These are not required and are unreferenced throughout the game. However, they are gameplay-similar to Half-Life (the updated version under the name 'Black Mesa' as listed above) and are always fun for additional Half-Life levels.  If you're into multiplayer, there's Half-Life 2: Deathmatch-- which consists of two opposing teams gunning each other down with guns spawned throughout the map.   Lastly, there's Half-Life 2: Lost Coast. This was a beta build that was created to show the physics improvements, and was not only canonically redacted, but also generally boring.  If you're interested in mods, I'd check out:   The Stanley Parable (Singleplayer/Story) Underhell (Singleplayer/FPS Horror) Dystopia (Multiplayer/FPS) Neotokyo (Multiplayer/FPS)"
HalfLife,38x7dt,MonkahBoy,2,Sun Jun 7 20:29:36 2015 UTC,He's asking for the full Half Life experience and your suggesting him to start with either an incomplete Black Mesa or skipping the first game entirely? That doesn't make much sense to me. Also Half Life is most definitely famous because of it's first game. HL2 is awesome don't get me wrong and a big part of why the series is so famous but it all started with HL1. You can't imagine how big of a deal HL1 was when it came out.

HalfLife,38uz8d,Lightningstar95,3,Tue Jun 9 08:35:42 2015 UTC,A fun challenge is to keep all the followers alive.
HalfLife,38uz8d,badguy28,4,Tue Jun 9 14:39:08 2015 UTC,"Give Azure Sheep a try. Point of View is another cool mod, which has some tie-ins with Azure Sheep."
HalfLife,38uz8d,Barney99x,2,Sun Jun 7 02:33:53 2015 UTC,"AZ has really bland-ish map design until the final showdown, which actually felt like a bombed-out ruin. Lots of weird, undecorated mazes, ""special forces"" that were reskinned, with weapons out of Aliens. PoV's a bit better, I think, if only because the weapons are new n' interesting.  Case Closed and Poke 646 (and its sequel) are great."
HalfLife,38uz8d,JayrassicPark,2,Sun Jun 7 02:54:50 2015 UTC,"Half-Life: Zombie Edition, it fits in the story well."
HalfLife,38uz8d,FNaF_walrusman,2,Sun Jun 7 17:02:27 2015 UTC,"There are many mods that fit nicely into Half-Life's lore. Here are some that I would recommend personally:   Absolute Redemption   This mod is a continuation of the first Half-Life in which G-Man has contracted Gordon Freeman for another mission. You could treat this as Half-Life 1.5.   Point of View   Play as a Vortiguant during the Black Mesa incident. Made by the same team behind Azure Sheep, but I wouldn't consider that mod lore friendly because you fight alongside Freeman and Shepard. Point of View however does nothing to interfere with lore.   Black Operations   Play as a male Black Op assassin, as seen in Opposing Force. Unfortunately this mods primariy takes place outside of Black Mesa.   Poke646   This mod takes place a year after Black Mesa has been nuked. You play as a technical assistant for an organisation known as Poke646, which was  formed by the government in response to the Xen invasion.   Brutal Half-Life   Classic Half-Life with gore and more powerful weapons! What's not to love?"
HalfLife,38uz8d,Spatenator,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:05:29 2015 UTC,How do you mod the game?  Is there a Workshop?  I couldn't find it with the steam browser. At least Garrys Mod makes it pretty easy but there is no search.
HalfLife,38uz8d,fortifiedoranges,2,Mon Jun 8 16:31:45 2015 UTC,"Currently Steam workshop doesn't support Half-Life. If you want to install a mod the best place is ModDB. http://www.moddb.com/games/half-life/mods  ModDB has effectively acted as the home for Half-Life mods a while now. All the mods I previously mentioned are hosted here.  To install a Half-Life mod:   Go to the download section for your chosen mod on ModDB After downloading the mod navigate to ""Program Files/Steam/SteamApps/common/Half-Life"" Drag and drop your downloaded mod into Half-Life's directory Restart Steam   If done correctly the mod should be listed under your Steam games.

HalfLife,38tyvj,nuvoo,3,Sat Jun 6 20:29:04 2015 UTC,Why are people who mention Black Mesa are getting downvoted? Is the game some kind of no-go in the HL-community?
HalfLife,38tyvj,lolfish596,4,Sun Jun 7 09:48:34 2015 UTC,Because people want to never play something with NEW graphics it's not that same as something with graphics from the 90s tbh I love black mesa and I loved half life but I'd pick black mesa over hl any day I'll get downvoted to fuck for this
HalfLife,38tyvj,MixLync,3,Sun Jun 7 11:44:08 2015 UTC,They are probably getting downvoted because Black Mesa isn't complete.
HalfLife,38tyvj,Barney99x,4,Mon Jun 8 20:08:39 2015 UTC,"Black mesa isn't Half Life, it's Black mesa. If you want Half life, play Half life."
HalfLife,38tyvj,SlappyCromwell,4,Sun Jun 7 15:11:17 2015 UTC,"There's really not much out there. You could give the DiamonD pack a try, but I personally don't like it.  Half-Life doesn't look half bad considering its age when played at modern resolutions. If you really can't play it, go for Black Mesa, but be warned a large chunk of the game isn't finished yet."
HalfLife,38tyvj,LOCKJAWVENOM,5,Sat Jun 6 20:44:06 2015 UTC,"The Steam versions include the option to enable the original Gearbox High Definition Pack models if you'd like, but no graphics modifications are required to enjoy any entry in the Half-Life series."

HalfLife,38tyvj,PieruEater,3,Sat Jun 6 20:38:46 2015 UTC,What? Black Mesa and HL1 both have no cutscenes.
HalfLife,38tyvj,LOCKJAWVENOM,-1,Sun Jun 7 06:04:35 2015 UTC,"I do remember seeing the 1st tentacle scene as a cutscene, tho, did they change it ?"
HalfLife,38tyvj,DuIstalri,5,Sun Jun 7 07:30:19 2015 UTC,"Just like in Half-Life 1, there are no cutscenes. You can still move around, shoot, ect. as the tentacle attacks the guy in HL1, Black Mesa from 2012 and the Steam Black Mesa."
HalfLife,38tyvj,Inspector_Sands,2,Sun Jun 7 07:36:34 2015 UTC,You're probably remembering this from the trailer. It's not in the game.
HalfLife,38tyvj,LOCKJAWVENOM,-6,Sun Jun 7 08:48:02 2015 UTC,"This will probably be controversial, but if good graphics are essential for you then I'd recommend not bothering with HL1 and instead play Black Mesa. Its a total remake of HL1 using the Source engine. Unfortunately I haven't played HL1 in years so mods aren't my area of expertise."
HalfLife,38tyvj,EpicShot649,0,Sat Jun 6 20:38:17 2015 UTC,"As somebody who's currently in the middle of making a polished one, I can say that a full overhaul that updates both the models AND world textures to HD levels is hard to make, hard to install, and even harder to remove bugs from / iron out. Black Mesa is good, but I would VERY STRONGLY recommend HL1 WITHOUT the HD pack but with something like a simple, hi-res weapon pack.  Install these files into the Half-Life/valve/models folder and uncheck HD models in video options: http://hl.gamebanana.com/skins/137489 Also, if you want better enemies and items, drag the models folder from this: (http://www.mediafire.com/download/p9g92nmpw92a5wp/trusty_crowbar_hl.rar) and put it in your valve folder before you install the first pack.  In my opinion, following this will give you the BEST POSSIBLE EXPERIENCE while playing the original. Black Mesa is a no-no because you will not be able to play the ending and it is best enjoyed after all the Half-Life games have been beaten. Plus, remakes of Half-Life's two awesome expansions are fall from done. Playing those after Black Mesa would be a hard graphical drop. Feel free to PM me if you need installation help."
HalfLife,38tyvj,LOCKJAWVENOM,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:08:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I will give it a try.   I must say, I was playing yesterday for around three hours and I find the original graphics totally acceptable. I play at 1920x1080, so that is a huge plus.  The controls though are tricky, I’m sliding constantly, movement is not very precise. This makes the small plattforming parts pretty hard. I’ve died numerous times by just falling of a ledge because I was sliding a few inches after actually stopping …"

It may be too late for you to get used to it, but it slows down the movement by default, adds a sprint button that gets you to the original high speed and a custom walk button for immersion / roleplaying / precise jumping. It also uses HL2's sprint sound."

The logos look awful in general, the idea of a two-part Half-Life 3 is not just idiotic but completely unbelievable, a new Counter-Strike won't be released any time soon as CS:GO is being built into a long-term competitive Counter-Strike platform, and it's highly unlikely that HL3 is near release at this point.

HalfLife,38r65k,LOCKJAWVENOM,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:59:12 2015 UTC,Azure Sheep isn't in a different timeline. It stays in the same HL universe. I'm unsure of what you're talking about. Perhaps you are talking about the fact that Azure Sheep has some inconsistencies with the established canon that were oversights. The biggest ones are that Gordon talks and you fight with him and you can do the same with Shepard. But it's still supposed to take place in the canon. I definitely agree POV did a better idea of avoiding inconsistency.

As somebody who's played all the great HL1 lore-based mods, (Azure Sheep, POV, Poke, ect.) this is BY FAR my favorite. Aside from hit-and-miss voice acting at few points, it is absolutely mind-blowingly awesome. Despite being puzzle and adventure focused as well as tricky to figure out at times, there are some seriously badass moments, and they blew my mind all the way to the end. Don't worry, there is still satisfying combat as well, but the game intelligently spreads it out. You play as a soldier, but I don't think you actually need Opposing Force despite some OF enemies showing up at points (and 1 OF weapon if you're quick and clever enough to get it). The level design is superb, the detail is very high, and you'll visit some familiar areas. It's easily my favorite HL1 mod.  TL;DR: Play Focal Point.

HalfLife,38kodm,7hru,39,Thu Jun 4 23:46:43 2015 UTC,"to be fair, the fallout games are huge with hundreds of hours of game play for each installment. also it isn't seriously story based and didn't end on a cliffhanger. its not that they (really i should say we i have been waiting for fallout 4 as well) didnt wait a long time, its just they have not been waiting as long, and even when we had waited the same amount of time the situation was much worse for us.   also, Bethesda still needs to make games. valve doesn't. so that fear of never getting another half life is all to real, while another fallout felt like a given."
HalfLife,38kodm,kwertyuiop,5,Fri Jun 5 01:04:32 2015 UTC,"That brings up a good point, did Fallout 3 end on a cliff hanger or was it just ambiguous? What would be the line between the two? You were in danger in Episode 2 I guess."
HalfLife,38kodm,fortifiedoranges,18,Fri Jun 5 01:19:49 2015 UTC,"i am pretty sure fallout 3 had a full ending, maybe a bit ambiguous.   it doesn't really matter though, no fallout game is a direct sequel to the others. sure they take place chronologically after, and some things from previous games come back, but you play as a different character every time and the stories are mostly self contained.   unlike half life, which has a very tight linear story which goes game to game.   episode 2 had a cliffhanger because you were about to go someplace that had been built up and find out some major information, then ended (spoilers) right after a major character died.   fallout 3s ending might be a bit ambiguous with whether your character lives or dies, but you achieve your goal and the story ends."
HalfLife,38kodm,MarshManOriginal,5,Fri Jun 5 01:25:12 2015 UTC,"You pretty much choose to do the right thing or be a dick and it affects the ending but it's a Zelda style ending where it goes to a cut scene and you can't play after. The Broken Steel expansion added more to the story, the other expansions gave you awesome weapons.   That's what I don't understand,  they made five DLC for Fallout 3. Two of them had longer length than episode 1 and the other three easily added 16 or more hours of content."
HalfLife,38kodm,cubicApocalypse,7,Fri Jun 5 03:06:01 2015 UTC,And the only reason we waited that long was because Bethesda was working on Skyrim.

The half life 3 logo has concavity issues and looks shit in general. The left 4 dead logo is blotchy and the III is just slapped on haphazardly, down and to the right some. And "" - guns on us - ""??? It's in a different font, uses dashes for padding despite the fact that it STILL doesn't align it with anything else from the counterstrike logo.... GAAAH.  The whole thing is offensive to look at. And also, ""SEE THE NEW ENGINE IN..."", what the fuck does that even mean?

And Valve is smart enough not to make some stupid shitty spin-off either. Also HL3 and L4D3 happening at relatively the same time and on top of that a new CS game is pretty much impossible too.

HalfLife,38mabv,doublicon,9,Fri Jun 5 04:22:27 2015 UTC,"Ya know, as I've grown older (I'm 29 now) I have found myself growing bored of the high-profile AAA games and playing more strategy games, like XCOM, Civ5, and Crusader Kings 2. Fallout 4 and MGSV are the only AAA games I am really excited for lately.  Maybe your tastes have changed... or you've really grown tired of video games, I dunno. Whatever works for you. If you don't like games no more, you don't like them no more."
HalfLife,38mabv,Riomaki,5,Fri Jun 5 04:36:10 2015 UTC,"I'd say that I'm in a similar boat.    I like my video games to be fun and present a lot of whimsical new ideas.  Fallout 4 excites me because, if it's anything like 3 and New Vegas, it will be an enormous world filled with new stories to experience.  Nintendo's games also excite me because even if something like Mario or Zelda is tried-and-true, they still find a way to give every level a new gimmick to play with.  And when you have dozens of levels, that's not a trivial thing to do.  Then you have stuff like Splatoon which is just brilliant.  But, by and large, I think triple-A gaming is a bore.  I've had it with the Call of Duties, the Assassin's Creeds, the Battlefields - all that yearly garbage where the developers are just going through the motions.  These games lack a spirit; they lack a spark; they lack warmth.  They feel like they are produced by algorithms in a machine, not people.  Again, going back to Nintendo, a lot of journalist-types chided them for not having these slick press conferences and presentations last E3 like Sony and Microsoft did.  But y'know, they did two things.  One, their presentation simply showed the developers playing and demonstrating their games.  Their passion was abundantly clear.  Two, with the Smash Bros. tournament, they showed gamers having fun playing their upcoming game.  Wow.  What a novel idea, huh?  Maybe we should ditch all of this Hollywood-inspired trailers-for-trailers nonsense, stop putting on airs and get back to basics here.  It shouldn't be about who has the most money to fund the slickest PR campaign - it should be about whether or not the game is fun.  A fun game speaks for itself."

There are Steam servers, need admins to run that.  Need sales/legal/marketing teams to promote new games, and to bring new devs onto your platform.  They still have 'current' games (DOTA2, CS:GO) that need active dev work.  They have steamOS that needs devs, and they also have Steambox, Steam controllers, and the Steam Streamer thingy, they all need engineers, marketers, devs.  They have 'future projects' (well Source Engine 2) that need developers.

And if Valve, as a distribution platform, also happen to have an engine that smaller developers can use for free as long as they sell their game on Steam, then why not, as a big company, provide an engine that these smaller companies can use."
HalfLife,38mabv,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:50:11 2015 UTC,"Valve relies on steam to make money, they get a huge chunk of income from it   Yes so it's one of their focuses. Epic has no such platform so this is irrelevant.    they also just happen to have made games in the past...    Don't get what you're where you're going with this.   Valve has more of a vested interest making sure there's a platform for developers to sell their games then they do in having first party content.   Their first party content consists of CSGO and Dota 2. Steam's most biggest anchors. Both made by Valve (arguably CSGO isn't but the CSGO right now was vastly different from Hidden Paths).   then why not, as a big company, provide an engine that these smaller companies can use.    That's nice and all, and it will encourage people to use their engine. If they use their engine then the games must be on Steam. But what you're assuming is really dangerous. You're absolutely insisting that Valve will never make another game, because others will use their engine.  That is a poor speculation. During a vulcan presentation, Gabe Newell stated;   “Valve and the other Khronos members are working hard to ensure that this high-performance graphics interface is made available as widely as possible and we view it as a critical component of SteamOS and future Valve games.”   future Valve games.  You guys are all operating under really bad assumptions. Just because Dota 2 and CSGO are popular doesn't mean that Valve won't do anything different such as a singleplayer game.   Ask yourself this;  If Valve just stick to what was popular, wouldn't we seen tons of Half Life sequels by now?   And I don't see why you guys feel like they aren't a video game company. They own two of the largest games on the Steam platform. Video games is still very much a lucrative business for them.   Half Life 3 might not be released soon, or even being worked on. But this sub's consensus that Valve no longer develops video games is bloody ridiculous."

So that was a very pleasant surprise to me. Even the Episodes, I didn't really expect. However, after EP2 I pretty much knew for a fact they wouldn't continue the series.   At that point, Valve had so much going on. Portal and TF2 were the breadwinners of the Orange Box, of that there is no doubt. That was reflected in their developer cycles after the Orange box was released as well.   To be honest, I don't think there will be another sequel to Half-Life. I haven't really been waiting for one either. I know you are voicing your opinion, and you feel like your loyalty to the company is being dismissed... but for Valve, making another large and expansive single-player game is not a smart investment of their time and money.   Valve, and by extension Steam, was built on the backs of fans of Half-Life. They now endure thanks to the legion of 12 year olds with their parents' credit cards."

HalfLife,38mabv,raresh1,5,Fri Jun 5 05:02:41 2015 UTC,why can't they just say something ffs!
HalfLife,38mabv,dakoslug,2,Fri Jun 5 14:51:27 2015 UTC,"Valve's communication with their fan base is abysmal, I think that's the worst thing. They think it's better not to say anything than to make promises they can't keep. But that doesn't mean they shouldn't say anything at all, that's probably an even worse customer experience imo.  I'm not saying developers shouldn't keep their projects a secret, but there's a middle ground between breaking promises and ignoring your fan base. It's worse because Valve were actively developing HL and its episodes. They released one ending on a cliffhanger, mentioned the next game a couple of times around its release and then NEVER talked about it again.  It was the same waiting for the updates to the Xbox TF2 (I know). In that case they broke a promise on a release date AND never mentioned it again. And we're left to put the pieces together about what happened.   I've stopped holding my breath about HL3, when/if it's out I'll play and probably love it, but I'm caring less and less these days. Sort your shit out Valve.  /rant"

The majority make reskins, map packs, etc. Making a game requires a lot of work, generally way more than most mods. A mod can be made with only experience in hammer.  However, a full game, such as this or Black Mesa, requires management, 3d modelers, mappers, (sometimes) someone with some knowledge of psychology, texture artists, concept artists, writers, programmers, technical artists and more. Hell, some people specialize in parts of these areas. Not to mention that everyone has to work together."

You're one person taking on a job which triple a studios with hundreds of people at their disposal have trouble getting right.  If you're not going to use Valve's assets, and possibly even if you are, you'll need to take on the jobs of:   Map design, optimization, creation, testing, and asset placement 3d modeling, model optimization, texturization Texture artist, which requires knowledge of image editing and manipulation software Lighting, which requires a fair amount of psychological knowledge, mostly basic color theory, and in hammer you get no lighting previews. Not to mention lighting optimization. Programming in C++, a language better suited for people who aren't beginners and bugfixing, which requires knowledge of what causes bugs and heavy interpretation of code and code optimization (starting to see a pattern?) Advertising, what to say, when to keep your mouth shut, media releases, managing and doing interviews if necessary, knowledge of cinematography to make competent trailers Concept art Storyboard, plot and script writing Dialogue, voice acting and directing Audio engineering and acoustics Composition, which requires knowledge of music theory, instruments, acoustics, and some psychology Animation, effects and optimization, choreography Web development, design, hosting and minor code optimization, protection for attacks, forum moderation and hosting You need to juggle doing all these things, understand the tools well enough to use them effectively, and create consistently good assets.   I'm just scratching the surface here. It's not ""just adding a few hours,"" those mods very likely had a team of people working on them. It's hard work and is not as glorious as it's made out to be.

HalfLife,38iwiw,HypnoToad0,3,Thu Jun 4 20:31:46 2015 UTC,"That's mainly because Skyrim is based on a whole existing world :) All you'd have to do there is just make it so NPC's appear and give you new quests. I guess the scripting still takes enough time to be occupied with for a long time. But Half-Life is a very linear game, and not open world like Skyrim, Witcher, Borderlands, Fallout, etc. You'd have to map everything carefully. Scripting, map testing, creating new textures.

I know there were some attempts, I remember seeing a short HL2:Ep3 ""demo"" mod with Alyx with some new voice lines and a helicopter. There was also a kickstarter HL3 movie idea that fell on its face.  Its just very hard to create a new part of a story that MIGHT see some actual, official continuation.  Valve also has a history of purchasing succesful big mods of their games (BM, CS, TF etc) and purchasing an actual sequel to one of their ""running"" series would be just super weird (they could also become evil and shut down the whole project)."

Designed by Chuck Jones, this version of Gordon had a full, wild beard that made him look like a typical biker, as well as a bulbous grey-green HEV Suit (with ""Research"" written on the back) that resembled a space suit, hence the nickname of ""Ivan the Space Biker"". He also had a flattop haircut and no glasses. The beard was heavily reduced to eventually turn into the current Gordon's goatee. Of note is that he already had brown hair and green eyes. The model, ""doctor.mdl"", can still be found in the Half-Life game files, but it cannot be opened because it uses early version of .MDL format, however it is correctly recompiled for Half-Life: Source, making it viewable and usable in the Source version. Ivan looked like a ""Homeless hobo"" to some testers.

It's unclear if this will take off or not (seriously, folks, we need more maps... not silly sound packs). You want to support the developers to the tune of $20.

By announcing their big ticket game early, they ensure that people will watch their conference during E3 for more of that... after they talk about the other games they're bringing to market.  It's difficult to rise above the yearly sequel mediocrity at E3 these days.  You either need to get out in front, as Bethesda did, or do something completely different, like Nintendo does.  Course, that said, some games would command their own audiences just by teasing their arrival.  Fallout 4 is one of them.  Half-Life 3 is the same way."

The reason they've announced it before e3 is so that in their conference at e3 they can show of some of the game, release a new trailer maybe. Game companies never announce a game AND show off the gameplay in the same conference. What's more, Bethesda are revealing Doom which may or may not be an arguably bigger release.  My prediction is that Doom will get a big announcement and 1 trailer, and then Fallout 4 will take centre stage, because (again predictions) it will be coming out late 2015 early 2016, before Doom."

HalfLife,389h61,PaniX,21,Wed Jun 3 02:32:49 2015 UTC,"Imho, Valve would be making a stupid decision by not announcing or even disclosing news this year. Dark Souls 3 was just announced as well, and aside from all the awesome news this year it's been a great year for games overall as well.   2015 seems to be hitting a rare high point in terms of beloved franchises coming back and good quality titles. Valve should use this to their advantage by completely toppling everything, and revealing HL3. It would blow the lid off the entire fucking mainframe, and easily be the crowning achievment of 2015, not to mention would win them back a huge amount of lost and alienated fans.  Come on, Valve. Get your shit together. Everyone else is getting their cake, you can have some too. It's no lie!"
HalfLife,389h61,BunkBuy,6,Tue Jun 2 23:20:38 2015 UTC,"On the flip side, with all the highly anticipated games coming out this year fewer people would buy HL3 because they would have spent all their cash on those other games."
HalfLife,389h61,HeadHoffer,9,Tue Jun 2 23:25:05 2015 UTC,"OORRRRR  Half-Life 3 would absolutely crush the sales charts becoming the best selling game of all time and getting the very first 100 ever on Metacritic, The game would be so impressive that every gamer in the world would have common grounds for discussion, bringing near world peace.

Did it do anything particularly worthy of the claim of ""best game ever""? I'd say no. It was certainly a technical achievement, to run that game on such old hardware but in terms of gameplay, story and characters, it doesn't do much special."

HalfLife,389h61,IronicTitanium,5,Tue Jun 2 23:45:06 2015 UTC,"I think you jest but I think your statement is valves opinion: both half life one and two were evolutionary. They are both genre defining in the ways that they changed fps and even more broadly story telling in video games. Maybe valve feel that oculus is sufficiently genre redefining to be worthy of hl3, but I really think they are afraid of a lackluster installment and that fps just doesn't have the room for an equal. We as fans want a conclusion to the story arc. They as developers (artists) want something that can stand shoulder to shoulder with hl1&2"
HalfLife,389h61,Ra1nMak3r,3,Wed Jun 3 04:08:30 2015 UTC,I think valve use the Half-life series now as a sort of tech demo. Amazing brilliant tech demos. Maybe they're waiting for something good to go with it. Oculus is too complex I feel... The physics engine hl2 brought along didn't need new/extra hardware.

HalfLife,389h61,Chronicjihad,5,Tue Jun 2 21:02:30 2015 UTC,"The Workshop Tools were DLC too, actually. The strings were leftovers because of being in the same development environment."
HalfLife,389h61,doublicon,3,Tue Jun 2 21:05:52 2015 UTC,"It'll be released as DLC and you'll be able to switch between Source 2 and Source 1 probably through a pop-up when you hit play (as is with many games that have options outside of the client and such). However, it'll still be a full Source 2 client nonetheless, so being DLC wouldn't affect it at all, but I guess since it'll be sorta the official release of source 2 for dota 2 they may have polished it and removed any unnecessary strings."

It is close though.   lso, does this mean all the current Source games are able to be just switched over to Source 2   In a sense, yes. Im guessing that they are using dota to polish the engine up, after that you could port hl2 and such with relative ease, though i presume cs:go is first in line (i'd like to assume they are already working on that) After that the other games are just repetitive work to port (if they ever get ported - hl2 and such).

HalfLife,383u5m,Slocknog,-8,Mon Jun 1 20:25:34 2015 UTC,Dota 2 is a MOBA. If it was RTS you'd be controlling everyone.

That can be literally anything that involves battling. You can even call CoD a MOBA in a sense.  The true term for it that is very specific is ARTS. In an RTS you control everyone, in an ARTS you only control very few units. Also in Dota 2, unlike LoL, there are heroes who have summon units as well as heroes that consist of multiple units."

HalfLife,383u5m,Esfer25,9,Mon Jun 1 22:14:48 2015 UTC,"Let's take the international 2014 prize pool of $10,930,698. Fans raised $9,330,698 of that, which was only 25% of the actual amount that was paid to Valve. Subtract the $1.6 mil that Valve donated to the pool, and another $1,000,000 or so for the costs of the event itself and you've still got roughly $30,000,000 from a single event - not including any items/keys/tickets/swag/etc that were sold throughout the year, plus the holiday bonus stuff that comes out. This year's International is already at $10,360,119, so that's already another $30,000,000 in profit, and there's still 2 months until the actual event. Fans could easily bump that prize pool up another $5,000,000 ($15,000,000 more profit). Based on the rewards page, Valve is certainly expecting as much.    The player counts above aren't even counting Asian players, which make up a substantial portion of DOTA players. To think that CS:GO is even remotely on the level of DOTA is just pure fantasy."

HalfLife,382x41,howtospeak,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:24:41 2015 UTC,"According the Mark Laidlaw (paraphrasing) - Gearbox games (Opposing Force, Blue Shift, Decay) are like a Schrodinger's cat of canon, they're neither canon nor non-canon, unless they're ever reused or contradicted in a future valve game.  Although I think he's stated certain events are canon such as the destruction of black mesa which was never in the original HL.  Also it's canon that Barney in Blue-Shift and HL2 are the same person. Well, in HL2 he sort of represents all Black Mesa security guards, just as Kleiner represents all the scientists, but his name is confirmed to be Barney Calhoun in the credits, like it is in Blue Shift.

HalfLife,383edn,Wawawawaluigi,3,Mon Jun 1 15:55:23 2015 UTC,Very interesting theory.
HalfLife,383edn,EpicShot649,2,Mon Jun 1 17:13:20 2015 UTC,Wasn't it implied that GlaDOS actually was Caroline?
HalfLife,383edn,ThatOneSlowking,3,Mon Jun 1 16:05:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, Caroline is still GLaDOS. The G-Man just influenced the creation of GLaDOS. Only the G-Man knew it's purpose in his plan."
HalfLife,383edn,PatriotUkraine,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:12:27 2015 UTC,"So I think that the final boss of Half Life 3 will be the G-Man, with the power of the Vortessence. The remnants of the Combine will have to ally with the Resistance to destroy the G-Man.  For Chell, right after Portal 1 that she was 'dragged' back to the facility. So the G-Man, seeing the potential in Chell since she almost escaped the facility and destroyed GLaDOS using a portal gun, decided to put Chell in a short stasis, which ended when the Half Life characters reach the Borealis. So Chell will end up in a prison cell, stripped of her portal gun, which turned out to be under custody of the Combine.   So the Half Life characters fight waves of Combine in the Borealis, and during that time, they take the portal gun away from custody and used it to free Chell, whom became an assistant fighter by not directly combating the Combine, but hindering them with PORTALS!  As I said earlier, the G-Man should be some final boss, with the power of the Vortessence that was acquired from the tech in the Borealis, unfortunately with the help of the Half Life characters and Chell. Once the G-Man was defeated, the fate of the Half Life characters are unknown, but Chell was eventually taken back to the Aperture Science Enrichment Center, where she will be held in stasis for ten thousands of years."
HalfLife,383edn,mangopear,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:41:20 2015 UTC,"I think it might be interesting for this kind of final battle to occur, but for the main characters to lose to G-man and his employers. A kind of dark ending might set Half Life apart from most happy ending games."
HalfLife,383edn,Riomaki,0,Thu Jun 4 03:02:06 2015 UTC,"All I got from this is that it's hard for me to accept the fact that Cave Johnson exists in the same continuity as City 17.  Like, I was fine with the connection when it was just Portal 1, you and GLaDOS in some non-descript laboratory.  But Portal 2 was so ""out there"" sometimes, it really didn't feel like it belonged in the same continuity at all."
HalfLife,383edn,Desertico,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:42:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's one of the reasons that i felt disappointed of portal 2 in terms of plot."
HalfLife,383edn,mangopear,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:03:47 2015 UTC,"I feel like Portal 2's plot makes a hell of a lot more sense than Half Life 2's though. Half Life 2 consisted of making wrong turns, retracing steps, mysterious G-man encounters, and radical plot changes. There's nothing wrong with that, and that's part of the beauty of the Half Life games. For the Portal games, I think Valve wanted to make a centralized, focused plot. Events proceeded somewhat logically, and without divine interference (g-man)."

HalfLife,381blx,nightsfrost,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:20:46 2015 UTC,The way the team and Valve keeps acting makes me think it will be a coordinated release with HL3 or with Source 2. But then again they've recently made a statement that BMS is not on Source 2 but a hybrid.  Still it shouldn't be too long. I expect a full Source 2 release(Dota 2 upgrade) and Xen by the end of this year.
HalfLife,381blx,mechanical_animal,4,Mon Jun 1 03:32:54 2015 UTC,"You expect too much.  Seriously, I don't believe there's any special connection between the Black Mesa team and Valve itself, beyond Valve giving them their blessing to use Half-Life's IP.  Plus, most of Black Mesa's work the last couple years was porting the mod to Source 2013.  It would seem like an awful waste of time to turn around and upgrade yet again, don't you think?  I think that Xen, if it happens at all, is at least 2 years away.  If Xen was really that far along, they should be able to guesstimate it for their Early Access page, at least down to the quarter of the year.  Instead, we don't have anything to go on, so that's why I think it's a long ways off.  That's why I say to people interested in Black Mesa, buy it if you're going to be happy with what's already there.  If and when Xen happens, it will be a nice bonus.  But don't set yourself up for potential disappointment.  If you are steadfast in wanting the complete experience, then by all means hold off."

I've argued this viewpoint myself in the past and for a brief while I did believe they were connected but since the team has gone on record in the recent month stating the engine is a hybrid I don't believe Source 2 is connected anymore. At first I thought it was a matter of release agreements similar to the simultaneous release of HL1 and Vampires.  Now it's clear that what took so long was porting to the new engine and the Xen overhaul(instead of a remake).   I think that Xen, if it happens at all, is at least 2 years away. If Xen was really that far along, they should be able to guesstimate it for their Early Access page, at least down to the quarter of the year.

But don't set yourself up for potential disappointment. If you are steadfast in wanting the complete experience, then by all means hold off.   Them releasing the early access version of the game can only mean two things imo: (1) they're desperate for funds or (2) the Xen release isn't too far away barring any unforeseen consequences. I just don't see the reasoning behind doing that if neither of those are valid, they would have had to known they'd just be inducing more hype for nothing.  And then there is Source 2 which was supposed to have a forthcoming release in the first half of 2015 but there is still no news on that. With E3 approaching there is possibility Valve will debut Source 2 there but it is primarily/officially a Dota 2 feature."
HalfLife,381blx,mechanical_animal,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:47:15 2015 UTC,"Porting to the new engine and deathmatch, really.  I respect the ""it's done when it's done"" philosophy as much as anyone.  But if they were really close, like end-of-year close, they should be able to provide that estimate with some confidence.  Realistically, once you start charging for your work, you're in the big leagues and you have to be able to estimate this kind of thing.  I'm trying to look at this through a Kickstarter lens.  No one expects the estimates to be dead on accurate, but having a timetable to aim for is beneficial for everyone."

He may even have been killed, not wearing the HEV suit. Nobody would have killed the Nihilianth and the portals would have remained open. The entire planet might have been torn apart by Xenian creatures instead of the (marginally better) ordered enslavement by the Combine. All because you missed that tram.

Surely a developer would say that, but i've never seen any ai acting deeper than ""aimbot the shit out of the player"" and "" try to crouch behind a box"".  Unless they meant they programmed a scripted path trough the entire game and gave the ai 100% aimbot.  Usually that's what's meant as ""harder ai"". Even Black Mesa developers thinks that way, they didn't make the enemies smarter, they are actually dumber than the ones in hl1, but they now have insane aimbot properties, locking you trough walls and never losing track."

""Mr. Friendly"" was one such creation and was a ""Cthulhu-esque dog with a very obvious phallus"". Ted(?) explained that everyone's seen big cyborgs with guns for hands, and that's not scary, so let's go with something that elicits more of a ""homophobic response"".

HalfLife,37tosk,self_defeating,12,Sat May 30 08:27:09 2015 UTC,"Grenades are supposed to be used when a group of enemies can't see you, or when you want to flush out an enemy from a single spot. You're not supposed to use them to when someone's rushing towards you."
HalfLife,37tosk,kingkolton9,20,Sat May 30 15:29:45 2015 UTC,"I'm the same - I hardly ever use them.  Mainly because I try to ""save them for later"" and then never use them. But also in HL1 grenades are impossible to get where you want them, they hardly bounce off walls or anything, and they do little damage. In HL2, you can't ""cook"" them, to time them to blow up sooner by holding them for a while before throwing them. Which makes them pretty useless. I only use them in places where there's a crate of them, and I throw them all over the place by the dozens (like just before taking out the ""auto-gun"" in EP2, when you get to the building full of combine soldiers and you have a crate of grenades, I just fill the building with them and boom).  Now, in Black Mesa, I do use them a lot: You can cook them, throw them, they bounce off walls and behave like proper physics objects, and they do lots of damage. This is how grenades should have always been."
HalfLife,37tosk,higgs8,13,Sat May 30 09:01:15 2015 UTC,"If you're profecient in using the hotkeys, you can throw a grenade in hl2 with right click, dropping it, and then use the gravity gun to cook and aim it"
HalfLife,37tosk,MixLync,6,Sat May 30 13:53:10 2015 UTC,Common tactic in HL2:DM.
HalfLife,37tosk,HyvelTjuven,4,Sun May 31 02:23:03 2015 UTC,"I'm the opposite, I found grenades impossible to use in black mesa because their trajectory felt off and I couldn't line up the throws.   Instead of getting thrown from the center of the screen they would get thrown from the right side of the player often making it bounce right back at you on some wall. I know it makes sense to have the nade get lobbed from the site which you're holding it in but when you're used to the mechanics from HL2 and CS:GO where they do leave the player from the center of the screen this behavior was really difficult to deal with."
HalfLife,37tosk,Riomaki,5,Sat May 30 09:19:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hate the grenades in Black Mesa.  When I was building my map, there was a bit where you had the option of using grenades if you were clever.  I never once got those darn things to go where I expected them to, and I did it dozens of times.  Of course, I'd do it well enough to accomplish what I needed them to do, but nailing the optimal toss felt like luck.  And the same thing was true of Black Mesa itself.  That bit in Surface Tension where you lob grenades up to the sniper nest?  Holy crap, I expended my whole supply trying to get it in there (not to mention that the sniper's actual hitbox is rather small).  I can't put my finger on exactly why they are so bad.  The procedural arc is very hard to judge and has seemingly no connection to your crosshair.  They seem to have a larger collision box than HL2 grenades, so they often knick geometry you don't expect them to.  And I think they also commute from your right hand toward to the center of the screen, which means if you're trying to lob one through a doorway, chances are it will get hooked on the right side of the doorframe instead.  HL2 grenades may not have been perfect, but they were predictable.  It's just one of many things they ditched and replaced with their own funky code with seemingly no good reason.  I would say that rolling the Black Mesa grenades with RMB helps a lot."
HalfLife,37tosk,higgs8,2,Sat May 30 16:06:07 2015 UTC,"That is true actually. The snipers in Black Mesa are almost impossible to aim at. The thing is, in HL2, the center of the screen is where the grenade will be thrown. So all you have to do is do like with any weapon: aim the crosshair and throw the grenade. But then in Black Mesa, the ""aim"" part is totally unpredictable. But I like the ""easy cooking"", but otherwise they should behave exactly like in HL2, that would be great."
HalfLife,37tosk,type_a8,1 point,Sat May 30 21:07:45 2015 UTC,"It's because we're used to proper grenades in CSGO, i noticed the arc aims a lot higher right off the bat"

HalfLife,37tosk,MedicInDisquise,3,Sat May 30 09:23:37 2015 UTC,"I use grenades all the time, but not as a typical use. I use it when there's a huge squad of enemies and I have no smg grenades; I toss them on the ground with RMB and use the gravity gun to fling them towards the enemies. Makes it a lot easier."
HalfLife,37tosk,Brandy_Buck,3,Sat May 30 13:29:11 2015 UTC,"Yes. There are a few methods which may help to get to your 'nades faster:  -Master the weapon scroll (playing games like Counter-strike can help with this)  -Remember the ""Q"" button to quick-switch between two currently selected weapons.   -There are also numbers assigned with the weapon slots, you can hit those if preferred.  I've found them extremely useful with zombies, but combine are admittedly harder to frag. But when they're clustered in rooms a lot, for example near the end while storming City 17 and the Overwatch Nexus, they can be of use.   But overall yes, most of the time is is faster to just gun them down or Gravity Gun them."
HalfLife,37tosk,TheCanadianAlligator,2,Sat May 30 17:20:13 2015 UTC,"I used them a lot more in HL1/BM:S because aliens were a lot tougher than humans, generally. Nadespam would kill them more quickly and safely than guns would (well, except for that nuclear missile warehouse).   Generally the aliens and... well the all enemies in HL2 were a lot easier to kill with guns (except for striders and gunships for obvious reasons). You have what, generic humans that don't move with guns that don't do much damage, and the only time you really HAVE to use grenades against them are the snipers after Ravenholm. Then you have Headcrabs that have like 5-10 HP, the zombies where DPS is easier with guns for different reasons for each type, and the antlions that are pretty much always in your face unless you either have a target marked by pheropods, you are a speedrunner, or you are a very careful person doing Sandtraps.  I haven't fought Hunters yet, though - I don't have HL2:E2 on Steam and I'm too lazy to play it on my copy of Orange Box on the PS3. So I don't know/remember if grenades are useful against them, although IIRC AR2 balls are effective."
HalfLife,37tosk,Mustardgas22,2,Sat May 30 17:26:45 2015 UTC,"I use them all the time. Sometimes, a combine soldier takes cover behind a rock/etc, so I throw it to get him out. It sometimes kills them. Other times I'll run out of weapons I don't need to reload and just drop one on the ground, then use the gravity gun as a grenade launcher."

HalfLife,37sibh,MrBarrelrolll,5,Sun May 31 01:13:40 2015 UTC,"The only reason it happened in Half Life 2 was because Half Life lacked named characters. They didn't have the technology to portray characters the way Half Life 2 did.  That said, some of the background NPCs that developed stories of their own (like the couple that appears in HL2 and Episode 1) might make appearances."
HalfLife,37sibh,1upD,4,Sat May 30 02:12:21 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but I can't think of too many characters where I'd see them in HL3 and go ""Oh yeah it's... that guy!""  Not that Eli, Kleiner et al were properly defined in HL1, but like others said, HL1 didn't have many named NPCs to begin with.  Eli and company are a pastiche of all the Black Mesa scientists.  You could have a rebel who represents the collective resistance movement, but that's essentially the role Alyx plays."

It was a Red Letter Day because Kleiner finally managed to get the teleporter to work."

HalfLife,37rdxq,Jackathan,6,Fri May 29 21:32:28 2015 UTC,"A red letter day in science has nothing to do with a religious red letter day. The term originates from the religious usage, however. The term in science just means ""A day of importance.""  The reason why it's a red letter day is because the teleporter is fully functioning. He's had some trouble with this in the past, which includes having to turn a cat inside out (The audio in-game is cut) to make sure it was the correct thing teleported.  Not to mention Our Mutual Friend arranged a certain Doctor to come back."

HalfLife,37nc05,SlappyCromwell,3,Thu May 28 22:21:38 2015 UTC,Isn't it a bit odd that it's only in the credits though? Everyone else's first and last names are really shoehorned into the script for the player's benefit. Barney is just Barney.
HalfLife,37nc05,SlappyCromwell,11,Thu May 28 22:43:33 2015 UTC,"There are several characters in the series whose names you'd be hard pressed to identify unless you knew where specifically to look. It's not as if The G-Man is ever called such in any of the games. Dr. Breen's first name is only spoken twice in the entire series, both instances during the same scene by one character. Dr. Magnusson's first name is never spoken at all. Barney's last name being featured in the credits is a pretty huge highlight of that fact when you consider some character names are never mentioned either during spoken dialog or in-game text.  This is all fairly moot, though, since there are many official supplementary sources that state this information in an outright and unambiguous manner."

Since the nuke at the end of Opposing Force is confirmed canon, the expansion don't create any problems with existing canon, and the expansions were generally liked and well-made, the vast majority of the community considers the two expansions canon."

In fact, it was one of the leading reasons why Opposing Force wasn't canon at all. I would argue that Blue Shift is not particularly well liked though, and it doesn't really add much--if anything--to the story.   Opposing Force introduces an entirely new alien race with their own agenda, as well as the destruction of Black Mesa. These are two fairly large facets of the story that are never again mentioned or referenced in later games."

Unless, of course, his arc is just concluded from the perspective of the new protagonist - which wouldn't really work unless they decided to voice and characterise him. I say finish Gordon's story and then we can talk about new protagonists in the HL universe.   whilst Gordon is the main character it'd be cool for other characters had their moments in the spotlight.   I would say the other characters of HL are constantly in the spotlight. It is Gordon who takes the back-seat.

HalfLife,37mqhy,teuast,5,Thu May 28 21:30:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind it, as long as it's not a character who previous was a talking NPC.  Like, I wouldn't pick Alyx, for example.  But Shepard, sure.  Some unknown member of the Resistance?  Absolutely.  Particularly in light of the two cancelled Episodes we've learned about, I think it's a shame that HL2 didn't get the side stories treatment that HL1 did.  I also think that not basing it around Freeman can be creatively liberating.  Bungie, for example, did some of its best work when it wasn't focused on Master Chief.  In both ODST and Reach, they were able to tell the story from a different perspective - often from those who didn't make it."

HalfLife,37o0ur,CarlTheCrawdad,-3,Fri May 29 01:29:11 2015 UTC,I can't stand Black Mesa's multiplayer. It's like a Half-Life version of Counter-Strike.
HalfLife,37o0ur,kingkolton9,2,Fri May 29 03:19:08 2015 UTC,Yeah except for the fact that counter strike was a mod for half life to begin with. So counter strike multiplayer is like is like a counter strike version of half life
HalfLife,37o0ur,Shinymew12,-1,Fri May 29 15:52:14 2015 UTC,"No.   I said ""Half-Life"" Counter Strike. Counter Strike does not take place in the Half-Life universe. Black Mesa does. Black Mesa multiplayer plays like Counter Strike with different weapons, to me. If I wanted slow-paced multiplayer with a shortage of weapons and health, slow running speed and a high skill-cap, I'd play Counter Strike. Half-Life deathmatch is literally the opposite of these things. Hell, even the respawns in Black Mesa are similar to CS's."
HalfLife,37o0ur,kingkolton9,1 point,Fri May 29 19:04:55 2015 UTC,Yeah except with respawning Getting more health during gameplay Carrying more guns at a time Long jump module Open-ended maps  Hey wait a minute that doesn't sound like counter-strike This plays way more like quake. Not counter-strike. Not all arena shooters are the same.

And you're rarely carrying more than a pistol. When you are, someone with a better gun kills you pretty much on sight.  It sounds like counter strike to me. It doesn't sound like quake, nor does it play like quake."

HalfLife,37o0ur,BlueMewGaming,1 point,Sat May 30 20:16:25 2015 UTC,"You respawn in counter strike after the rounds are over. Not instantly after death. I shouldn't have to clarify that. Not to mention if you survive the round in cs, you keep your weapons. That never happens in black mesa Things are tactical orientated in cs where every movement counts, and it means more when you die. You are finishing an objective to win. In black Mesa dying happens but it's all about just netting the most kills. Counter strike has a buying system between rounds. Nothing close to what black Mesa does.  Now the further gripes you mentioned: I can usually kill people with just the pistol. Health is usually plentiful, but you need to know where to find it. If it's rare, just explore more and you will come across something.  Yeah it really feels like a quake/unreal tournament feel on how it plays. Nothing like counter strike unless you spend most of your time playing gungame. Which feels even less like black mesa's mp.  You seem to have more of an issue with arena shooters, but they can't be compared with the likes of counter-strike. They are two different beasts."
HalfLife,37o0ur,KiLlEr10312,1 point,Sat May 30 21:46:59 2015 UTC,"You don't respawn ""instantly after death."" You respawn after ~5 seconds where you can view what other players are doing (A ""feature"" of CS, though they didn't come up with it.)   That never happens in black mesa   If you can even grab any of the weapons in Black Mesa, you'll pretty much keep them the entire round or until you run out of ammo, unless someone with a better weapon comes by.'   Things are tactical orientated in cs where every movement counts, and it means more when you die. You are finishing an objective to win. In black Mesa dying happens but it's all about just netting the most kills   Every movement counts in every deathmatch game, ever. You're finishing an objective in Black Mesa deathmatch (Kill that asshole!)   Nothing close to what black Mesa does.   Let's see their similarities:   Slow running speed Shortage of weapons Slow paced High skill cap Little to no health or armor in a level    I can usually kill people with just the pistol.   I can, too. I usually get more 9mm rounds out of the deal, or someone kills me as soon as I grab it.   Health is usually plentiful   There's not enough to support the number of people playing at one time   Yeah it really feels like a quake/unreal tournament feel on how it plays   No, it doesn't. Both of those are fast paced games. BM is undeniably slow, and I've never had an ammo problem in either of those.   You seem to have more of an issue with arena shooters, but they can't be compared with the likes of counter-strike. They are two different beasts.   Not at all! I played quake. Loved it; in fact I still play quake live. I've played Unreal tournament. Loved it. Played Half Life deathmatch. I really love that. Even though Counter Strike isn't an arena shooter, I feel the need to say that I like it.    The reason why I compared Black Mesa's multiplayer to Counter Strike is because it feels a hell of a lot more like CS than Half Life multiplayer. After an hour and a half on Black Mesa multiplayer, I can confidently say that's what it feels like to me. I will admit that it was more fun when I was playing on a server with 5 people than on one with 15 people. I feel like, unless the deathmatch weapons are made stronger, its ""carrying capacity"" will stay pretty low."

Secondly, the official explanation is that America best survived the invasion (despite being at the centre of the Resonance Cascade) with their greater military so the Combine stomped extra hard on that continent and moved the population to Europe whose population...did less well. So there's a lot of Americans in European cities, possibly even outnumbering the natives."
HalfLife,37iwje,2-4601,15,Thu May 28 00:31:01 2015 UTC,"So there's a lot of Americans in European cities, possibly even outnumbering the natives.   Seems like you solved a problem that OP's theory has missed.  Father Grigori has an Russian accent, so he was probably a native that had to learn English."
HalfLife,37iwje,PatriotUkraine,4,Thu May 28 01:41:45 2015 UTC,"Well, remember that Gregori was from the town of Ravenholm which was just headcrab bombed. The Combine never really worried about relocating him, becaure they probably figured no one survived. He's also not really in C17."
HalfLife,37iwje,8BitEggplant,3,Thu May 28 07:14:14 2015 UTC,"No, that doesn't make sense because Ravenholm wasn't shelled until after City 17 was established - it was used by the Resistance to house refugees."
HalfLife,37iwje,2-4601,3,Thu May 28 09:39:50 2015 UTC,"Then maybe the resistance took over Ravenholm before the combine were able to take control. So grigori was able to stay, and then the combine figured it would be easier to just bomb the town with headcrabs instead of fighting the resistance."

HalfLife,37iwje,NomDevice,1 point,Sat May 30 23:53:12 2015 UTC,That also depends on how exposed you are to a US accent. While their may be more Americans that doesn't mean that they will eradicate all of the other possible accents.

HalfLife,37iwje,AltaSkier,5,Thu May 28 11:37:22 2015 UTC,"you guys have some good theories, but here's the hard truth, derived from the marc laidlaw vault. http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2503050  Originally Posted by Marc Laidlaw  Viktor (Antonov, visual designer for HL2)was a big influence on the design but we were heading that way already--one reason things clicked so well when we first started talking with him. He was key in helping it crystallize. It certainly helped that the influences were in his blood.  The Americanness of the citizens was the result of audio limitations. One thing I wished we could have done, once the localization was accomplished, was mix it up so that the citizens' dialog drew from every single language we had translated for the game. The code to do this is not difficult; but it would have meant adding every single citizen audio file for every single language, rather than simply the local language. I wanted to do this for the City 17 announcer voices as well. If someone were to make this mod, it would represent what I think is a much truer picture of the City 17 that was in our heads."
HalfLife,37iwje,xLuberjack,2,Thu May 28 17:02:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it was basically a technical limitation. OP's theory is probably right in principle, in that the Combine move people around to disorientate them. However,   the Combine separated every individual culture and put the people from those cultures into different cities, as to discourage the intercultural mingling of ideas. The Combine does this to breed distrust and ignorance of other cultures in the minds of the Citizens, making it less likely for multiple cities to team up in rebellion against the Combine   No, deporting a whole group/culture as large as Americans for example to somewhere on the other side of the planet wouldn't really make much of a difference if they were still with their own people. Far better to move them and split them up.  Their coordination would be poorer and their morale would be lower if they were mixed with people they had little in common with. They'd feel more isolated and their environment would feel more foreign.  I think this is generally accepted by fans, I feel like I may have read speculation like this on a wiki. It's also likely that the Combine relocate people repeatedly to minimise their resistance. I think a citizen in the train station mentions they've been moved multiple times. The cities are probably named with a designated number to give them even less cultural identity.     Also,   City 17, despite appearing to be an eastern European location, is inhabited entirely by English speakers   Father Grigori was clearly eastern European.  He probably evaded the Combine's deportations and is one of the few remaining natives of the area."
HalfLife,37iwje,MashMango,1 point,Thu May 28 20:16:54 2015 UTC,I thought the city was based off Russian city's hence the architecture and colours used?
HalfLife,37iwje,Skyblaster109,1 point,Thu May 28 09:52:50 2015 UTC,"OP, I like your imaginative thinking; it's an interesting mystery as to why there are so many Americans in a seemingly eastern European city. However, I find it hard to believe that the Combine would go through so much effort. While their intent is not exactly clear, it seems at the very least that they want Earth's natural resources and to absorb humanity into the Universal Union. Before Gordon, the G-man, and the vorts got together, they fully expected humanity to wither away on its own due to infighting and the inability to reproduce.  In my opinion, the remaining humans are a mere nuisance kept in check largely by brainwashed humans. While Freeman and Alyx are a larger nuisance than the average human, the Combine barely need expend any resources to control what's left of humanity as the shear force of fear and ideas have in large part turned humanity against itself.  Most of what remains of humanity know that the Combine's military might is unparalleled (consider the 7 hour war).  The only thing that's unclear to me is whether or not the purpose of the Citadel was to create portals ""across the dimensions,"" or if it was just a coincidence that Gordon caused a portal storm that would eventually allow the Combine to return. That's such a huge coincidence that it seems far more plausible that the Citadel's main function was indeed connecting our universe to those universes already conquered by the Combine."
HalfLife,37iiru,Grimjarl,8,Wed May 27 21:54:20 2015 UTC,"Nothing says first person more than VR   Hold it right there! Gabe said in 5 March 2014 ""We aren't holding any game until VR is shipping. You don't want to create that kind of dependency."""
HalfLife,37iiru,ispeelgood,1 point,Wed May 27 23:38:06 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind my notion of GabeN as embodiment of the Lord is but a lighthearted quip, so I don't actually take his word as gospel. Although I do not deny the guy is a marketing genious, and it wouldn't even take a genious to realize the astronomical potential of shipping their flagship shooter in symphony with their next debut in hardware.   I was aware he said that, yet again he is just playing it safe as always. They most likely are not 'holding' any game, they are just focusing on developing the platform through which to showcase their evolution. In this case they got all their pistons firing at creating a next engine - an engine optimized for VR."
HalfLife,37iiru,ispeelgood,7,Thu May 28 00:05:19 2015 UTC,"Indeed they are, but I think that a game with high-speed movement such as HL would be a nightmare for VR seeing as locomotion is still a problem on that platform. If they do make a VR game it's probably gonna be more exploration-based rather than a full fledged run and gun FPS."
HalfLife,37iiru,tgkennedy,4,Thu May 28 00:14:40 2015 UTC,"http://www.techtimes.com/articles/37703/20150306/valve-removes-threat-of-vr-motion-sickness.htm  I don't see how the 'run and gun' gameplay can't be attainable - given there is no motionsickness. As for locomotion - it's just a matter of optimization. There is a host of potential new types of gameplay. I don't think we really understand yet what a massive leap forward it is going to be when this tech is properly implemented. It's a paradigm shift for the genre and the series and I think the creativity of the Valve devs is still getting to grips with the immense possibilities for puzzles, level design and other interesting aspects (interacting with the environment) that will blow HL2 out of the water. Finally, exploration is definitely an integral part of the HL experience - remember Highway 17? There's tons of examples but most importantly, the fact that one only scrapes the surface of the game from the 'run and gun' action, the true depth comes from the intricate themes and plots that are uncovered through storytelling through the players own exploration. I don't see why they wouldn't take it a notch further. I would even go as far to say that Half-Life is an exploration based game."
HalfLife,37iiru,Riomaki,12,Thu May 28 00:54:41 2015 UTC,"This was beautiful to read, thank you.  On to the point, I agree. I don't see why so many people are like ""Bluuh, the next Half Life is never coming. All hope is lost my friend, stop trying."" it truly is depressing to hear such things, to hear so many people have just given up. Most say they do it because ""We don't want to have to face another disappointment,"" but honestly, this is how waiting for a sequel is, you go through multiple disappointments before you get something.  Look at the Fallout Community, they have gone through things that are similar to what we go through. They had fake countdowns, promising leaks that didn't lead to anything, and teases, but never got anything at the most. Hell, even some of them started to say that Fallout 4 was never going to happen. But hey, turns out they ARE getting a Fallout 4.  Instead of just becoming a pessimistic downer and causing everyone to be depressed about it, look at it with an optimistic view. There are more things saying we are getting a Half Life 3 then there are things saying we aren't. Seriously, when you say ""Half Life 3 isn't happening, Valve doesn't care."", it causes those who are positive about it to worry. Not because we might not get one, but because such a vibrant and cool community is losing hope when the evidence is right there, saying we ARE getting a Half Life 3."
HalfLife,37iiru,tgkennedy,7,Wed May 27 22:26:18 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I'm not entrenched in the Fallout community, but I've always believed Fallout 4 was a foregone conclusion.  Bethesda is a fundamentally different company from Valve.  Fallout, along with the Elder Scrolls RPGs, are probably their top-grossing products.  So, naturally, they're going to make more of them.  That's not a question of if, but when.  Plus, with New Vegas, they demonstrated a readiness to let other developers take the reins if need be.  In comparison, Valve doesn't need to make Half-Life 3.  In fact there are many compelling reasons why they shouldn't, not the least of which are expectations being unreachably high as a result of their bizarre behavior toward their fanbase.  The way I see it, if Half-Life 3 happens, it happens.  But, until then, there are far too many other developers with great games available right now who deserve my money more than Valve does."
HalfLife,37iiru,thief90k,3,Thu May 28 00:24:27 2015 UTC,"Hear, hear. The pessimism is severely pathological and breathes a foul air through our community - undermining the very foundations it was built upon. This pervasive ideology can only be deterred with optimism and expressions of hope and rejoice with the advent of technologies as these.  The signs of a third coming are visible and the lack of faith is disturbing, to say the least."
HalfLife,37iiru,paxperscientiam,2,Thu May 28 00:19:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree..  The signs have all pointed to this...  Praise be to our Lord and Savior, Gaben."
HalfLife,37iiru,Dudugs,5,Thu May 28 02:04:20 2015 UTC,"I'm in between.  I believe in what Half Life and HL2 represent(ed) and I do believe that if HL3 comes it will have been worth the wait.  But I don't share your faith in Valve and Gabe.  Half Life will always be the beautiful thing that it is, with or without HL3.  But it is still by far my most hoped-for game.  I don't mind people claiming we'll never see HL3, it's a very real possibility, what saddens me is that it detracts from what HL already is."
HalfLife,37iiru,kingkolton9,4,Wed May 27 22:41:39 2015 UTC,"All true, though, IMHO, the deafening silence is hard to understand. I know Valve fears disappointing (consider Bungie's Halo 2 non-playable demo that lead to accusations of deception), but what's so dangerous about a clear cut, non-cryptic statement regarding its existence?  Gabe is always on about how his devs work on what they want to, so perhaps none of them give a shit about the HL universe? Even then, Gabe and Laidlaw know full well the value, so for there not to be a team working on it would be hard to believe. So, if there's a team, why no statement?  Perhaps there is no team.  I'm going to hold out until SteamOS and Steam Machines become a reality. My expectation is that HL3 will be the killer app. If by then still nothing, then...IDK. In the end it's a game, but it's not just a game.  /ramble"
HalfLife,37iiru,_FRANKENSTEIN_,2,Thu May 28 12:48:31 2015 UTC,"so perhaps none of them give a shit about the HL universe   That's laughable. It's Valve, pretty sure there are a lot of people who went to work there because of Half-Life."

HalfLife,37iiru,shootdawhoop99,1 point,Thu May 28 09:23:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that VR is next big thing in FPS and it could be a milestone after which Valve could actually bring life to their ideas, benefit maximally from technological progress and make Half-Life 3 as good and innovative as it can get. But, VR headsets aren't cheap which means that not everyone can enjoy and play the game as it is meant to, besides VR is a very demanding technology, you have to maintain 90+ fps on both 1080p screen in order to avoid motion sickness and that's a lot, today many gaming systems can barely run games at 60fps on 1080p screen with every setting set to ultra.  Of course Valve could make two version of HL3 but that would mean a lot of work because as Gabe said, not everything that's enjoyable on screen is enjoyable in VR and vice versa.  So unfortunately, in my opinion todays technology is not quite ready for HL3."

Same deal - bullshit about Steambox/Vive/etc.  At the end of the presentation, Gabe says ""Oh, and one more thing...""  Lights go dim, lambda appears on screen, crowd goes wild.  This is it!  5 minutes of footage where the camera is always pointed at a wall.  Like, it's all in-game footage, but the player is just aiming at walls.  Some of the walls look freshly painted.  Some of the walls look rusty and old.  One wall has snow caked up on it!  Occasionally, the player clicks his flashlight on and off.  I woke up in a cold sweat and couldn't sleep for the rest of the night."

HalfLife,3783n5,zoxxo,2,Tue May 26 04:07:05 2015 UTC,"i guess this dream was just a way of telling me that there's still some hope in the back of my mind, that someday it'll come, and it'll possibly be disappointing. i've been a die-hard fan of half-life ever since it's release (seriously ask me any question about half-life 2 and its episodes and i can answer it, no matter how niche it is) so i'll never be truly hopeless, but with each passing year i lose just a little bit of faith that it'll truly live up to standards. i have a depressing life."

I use to have the fantasy that after I finish playing my fix, that Valve will announce HL3. I truly feel that Valve has let us down in dragging out the issue so long without any word from them. I wish they would announce that HL3 is not happening--I'll be upset/disappointed, but at least I can move on with my life..."

The whole ""Pardon me"" / ""Let me get out of your way"" thing prevented me from treating them like actual people.  And the same for the scientists in HL1.  Valve kills them throughout, so you know they're going for dark humor.  Black Mesa was probably the only time I felt bad leaving them behind.

I just think that it's a ""Don't give up yet."" kind of message. Oooooooor they completely forgot about us and the whole franchise and I'm interpreting shit into this. :)"
HalfLife,374jnq,TroneZZZ,34,Sun May 24 22:34:23 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty skeptical about us getting HL3 like, next year or something.  But the people who say ""it's never going to happen"" clearly don't understand how the game industry works.  Valve will do it when it's convenient for them.  I know people technically choose what they work on, but Gabe ""encourages"" people to work on certain projects by handing out significant bonuses.  And as we know, if you work on something that isn't picking up support, you can be fired very quickly (Jeri Ellsworth).  What does it take to convince Gabe Newell HL3 is worth making?  Well for one, their other stuff needs to be finished first.  Source 2, Steam VR, possibly Steam Machines, etc.  Then, he probably needs a way to make sure it continues to make money after its release.  He likes games that make money for several years rather than pushing out as many games as possible like other big publishers.  TL;DR - It will happen once they have a reason to go back and do it.  EDIT:  To expand on Valve's business model, they would rather have a few assets that make them money over time rather than gambling on several products at once.  It's actually a pretty intelligent model.  Ubisoft takes a gamble that they can produce a new Assassin's Creed every year (potentially risking the entire franchise), while Valve will release a new Counter-Strike once every decade or so, and make their money off of all sorts of other things.    It doesn't just include games, either.  They're gambling on stuff like Steam Machines because they know the potential to make money over several years is there (I think it's a flawed idea, but they clearly see some value in it).  Source 2 will make them money in several ways as well.  The obvious one is games, but they're enticing the thousands of indie developers out there to give Source 2 a go, which means they'll have to put the game on Steam (which they were probably going to do anyways).  It's an engine everyone is familiar with because the indie devs of today likely grew up modding Half-Life back in the late '90s or early 2000s.  Steam VR is obvious.  It's an emerging industry and Valve has the pull both financially and popularity-wise to make their HMD the one that beats out Oculus (whose trust has stumbled a bit after the FB buyout).  I know people don't like to hear that even Valve likes to make money, but I choose to celebrate how clever they are at it.  Instead of seeing it as a point of criticism (they're a business after all!), I choose to admire how they are able to think outside the box and make money and please the community for the most part.  I don't think they try to be cool just to make money, I think they do it because it makes them money and because they enjoy it.  They aren't perfect by any means, but they've put out some of the best games and some of the best services in the past decade when it comes to gaming."

HalfLife,374jnq,darkhgdx,4,Mon May 25 02:22:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, i think they were waiting for their VR platform to come out, nobody releases an entire new system without having a flagship game to go with it."

HalfLife,3733lk,drsexybass,-3,Sun May 24 15:22:12 2015 UTC,What kind of a company ends a series on a dumb cliffhanging non-ending?  Don't say EA. Mass Effect 3 never happened.
HalfLife,3733lk,Eloquium,15,Sun May 24 16:14:17 2015 UTC,"Mass Effect 3 was fantastic. Get off the EA hate bandwagon. Their amazing support far outshines that of Steam, and to be completely honest, their games, even though broken most of the time are very fun to play. The only bad thing about Mass Effect 3 was it's ending, which was fixed via the Extended cut. Battlefield 4 was broken, sure, but they fixed it, and now it is fully functional (even if it was 7 months post release when it got fixed, I still think the launch was a god damn disaster, but I like to think it was just ""delayed"" and stayed in Beta for those 7-8 months). Hardline is functional, although boring. Dragon Age Inquisition is the definition of a good Action RPG. Sims 4 is crap though, there is nothing worth defending there, Sims 3 is better."
HalfLife,3733lk,NomDevice,4,Sun May 24 20:19:09 2015 UTC,"It's not a bandwagon if you feel genuinely disappointed by a sequence of choices that took many tens of hours over 3 brilliant games and which were claimed to be meaningful, only to have your shit pushed in by an early release with on disk paid DLC and endings that were less dependent on your choices in the THREE games total than the ending of Duke Nukem Forever. Bioware made Mass Effect as great as it was, EA's acquisition of Bioware only ruined that with moneymaking schemes. Same as a completely bare bones, communication-less, lobby-less multiplayer which wasn't even supposed to be a complete feature, but which EA plagued with microtransactions just the same.  I'm very glad you've had good experiences with origin and EA support, because I haven't really. I guess the refund for the completely unplayable BF4 was good. If you think finally fixing a netcode issue after almost a year redeems the forced launch and again, microtransactions + premium moneygrabbing schemes, sure, let's disagree on that. A 60 or more euro beta / early access should not be deemed acceptable. Many publishers do way better jobs with WAY fewer resources.  Pretty much all of the game series they've assimilated have deteriorated into middle of the road, fully tutorialed cash machines. ME1&2 were so much better and more immersive spaceRPGs. BF:BC2 was much better balanced and a lot more entertaining than it's successors. DA:i was saved by how expansive the story and areas were, but most non-main storyline quests were grinds and the multiplayer was a rushed ME3 copy. All of the games you mentioned as successes by EA would have been much better if the developers had gotten more time to actually finish a proper product, rather than forcing releases to maximize profit.  It's a matter of opinion at the end of the day, but it's not like I'm regurgitating other people's experiences out of the back of the EA hatewagon."
HalfLife,3733lk,Eloquium,2,Sun May 24 21:51:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of your points. That Battlefield 4 thing was sort of a joke from my side. And trust me, I was VERY disappointed by the original endings of ME3, but as someone who sank over 100 hours into those games for my main save, and about as much for secondary saves, the extended cut was a good way to end the story. And honestly, I dislike the ""destroy"" ending JUST because they try to give hope that Shepard is still alive. I like it better when his sacrifice is full.  Anyway, enough about ME3, I don't think that EA has fully redeemed themselves, but they are making steps in the right direction (small steps, but still, ""A"" for effort). And I am glad you didn't do what most people would have done and just replied with a generic insult-based text consisting of 2 sentences of verbal abuse. Have a nice day!"

HalfLife,3733lk,TheFlamingTaco,3,Sun May 24 14:14:21 2015 UTC,"No, this sub has been up in arms every since Gabe made a very vague statement about the current state of the Half-Life series.  All he said was that they would only do a ""retro"" game if a bunch of people at Valve wanted to, and that doing another Half-Life without looking at what they've done with Portal 2 or DoTA 2 would be a huge mistake but that doesn't mean what people are worried it might mean.  Personally, I think it means they aren't working on it currently.  Whenever they return to it, I think Gabe wants it to be more than just a $60 one-time experience (so have it be similar to their newer games).  The ""retro"" thing is so vague that it really isn't even worth discussing.  He probably means ""retro"" like how TF:C is considered ""retro"" compared to TF2.  Valve doesn't want an HL2 with a new setting and better graphics.  They want to do something different and put the Half-Life name on it (like HL2 did to HL1).  TL;DR - The Internet lost its shit over some vague, poorly worded statements."

HalfLife,3733lk,Dunder-Mifflin,5,Sun May 24 14:49:50 2015 UTC,"Read the article. Doesn't really strike me as him saying ""We're never doing HL3"", but more like ""HL3 isn't coming right now, but the possibility could exist if we get staff support"". Sounds like no one in the development staff feels like making it, which sounds a lot like Valve...  Honestly, if they aren't going to make a good HL finisher, they should just pawn it out to the guys who made Black Mesa. It'll still come out faster than Valve could ever make it, and I think I trust them enough to do the series justice"

It doesn't have the last part of the game, a huge chunk of Surface Tension (a really important chapter) was removed, the level layouts were changed a bit, etc.  It's almost like a re-imagining as opposed to a remake.  It's a great mod/game though, so I do recommend it.  Lots of people have had problems with Half-Life Source, but I played through it perfectly fine until the final boss fight.  I'd stick with the original Half-Life though, unless you want Garry's Mod NPCs and maps as well, in which case I'd get Source.  You don't need the original for the expansion packs (which you should definitely play as well.)"

HalfLife,375ne6,ReiBob,3,Mon May 25 18:28:45 2015 UTC,"play the original half life if you can. half life source is alright, but it can be a bit buggy plus IMO the realistic physics and water of the source engine do not fit well with the low polygon graphics of half life, its just weird and kind of takes you out of the experience. not to mention the original actually looks better because it randomizes its textures (or... something like that lol)   as for black mesa, it is a great adaptation but A: they don't have the last quarter of the game finished, so its missing the ending and B: it was really designed to be a celebration of half life, and can only be fully appreciated and understood after you have played the rest of the series.    so yeah, original first, source if you have to, and black mesa after you played the series."
HalfLife,375ne6,washout77,2,Mon May 25 03:18:05 2015 UTC,"You make it sound as Black Mesa is exclusively for those who already play it, I disagree.  I think they actually want Black Mesa to be the game that puts new gamers interested. It works both ways I guess, as a celebration and as a remake."
HalfLife,375ne6,washout77,3,Mon May 25 11:29:01 2015 UTC,"I'd encourage people to play Black Mesa first over the original, but only once it's finished. I think the game just needs the Xen part in order to explain the jump from HL1 to HL2, and really wrap up the HL1 story arch. While sure there are arguments to be made about the expansions and the graphical leap, which I think /u/mrcarkeys42 explained rather well, but I think they're arbitrary to most people. Black Mesa helps introduce people to HL who are used to more AAA titles, and if they really love it they'll get over the graphical leap, plus all the missing content is probably going to be reintroduced through mods at some point"
HalfLife,375ne6,ReiBob,1 point,Mon May 25 17:52:07 2015 UTC,"that is a fair argument, but i would say playing it first should be exclusive to people who really cant get over the old graphics. and while plenty of those people exist, i think there are also plenty that dont care. i think that if someone is just starting the series and they couldn't care less about graphics, they will have a better experience if they play the original first. i just dont think black mesa makes a good substitute for a first play-through.   i should mention now that i don't have some kind of bias against black mesa, on the contrary i actually like it more than the original, i just don't think it should be played first :P"

HalfLife,36z8ib,teuast,1 point,Mon May 25 22:01:46 2015 UTC,"<30fps seems pretty cinematic to me.   Whoosh   99% of modern mainstream movies are produced @24fps.   That's not the same. Movies are recorded, which means that every frame is a snapshot spanning some timespan. For example, with 30 fps and a 180° shutter angle, every frame is exposed for 33 ms. This results in some motion blur.  With games or CGI this is not the case. Every frame is exactly still.  This is the main reason movies allow for lower comfortable framerates than games.  Anyway, I was commenting on the fact that this particular video looks very jittery. It is probably lower than 30 fps."

HalfLife,36wvme,breakyourfac,18,Fri May 22 19:58:26 2015 UTC,"The SteamPipe update back in 2012 broke nearly every Source and GoldSrc mod, creating a mod ""bottlenecking event"" of sorts where only the actively updated mods would become usable after. This greatly decreased the number of functioning mods. Garry's Mod used to be a mod, but it got a full release on Steam as a game. Thing is, not many standalone mods can compete with Gmod with workshop support, leading to dying mod communities. Despite this, there are still mods that have pretty good communities."

HalfLife,36wvme,PropDad,11,Fri May 22 21:56:33 2015 UTC,"The people who were young teenagers making Source mods 10 years ago have now graduated from college. Those who did it as a hobby no longer have time to work on such projects, and the really talented artists and programmers went into the actual game design field. The Source engine at this point is as the awkward age where there is no one around to make, maintain, or play mods for it.   I'm hoping Source 2 will be a renaissance of sorts, but I think with the success of so many indie games and Greenlight in general, most people are not interesting in making free mods at this point. People would rather take a shot at making some money, and who can blame them?"

HalfLife,36xlm0,Slovier,9,Fri May 22 23:24:13 2015 UTC,"Developers generally don't do things that are ""unnecessary"" when making a game. To clarify, I mean that if something's not meant to or going to be seen by the player, nothing is generally there. Sure, sometimes there'll be easter eggs, but nothing that's going to use a lot of resources, especially during the 90s.  For an example with the source engine, if you're only meant to see 2 sides of a building, all of the rest have a ""nodraw"" texture applied, meaning that the engine skips lightmaps and that side is transparent. Why render something you don't need to? The player can't move too much, so there's no reason to put anything else there.  Tl;dr: Valve had no real reason to put anything there, so there's nothing there."
HalfLife,36xlm0,kingkolton9,4,Sat May 23 02:22:02 2015 UTC,"there are only actually like six or nine grunts on a small platform, the rest of the scene is skybox stuff (with zombie grunts, just the models). you can kill the real ones, and then there is nothing there."
HalfLife,36xlm0,eugd,3,Sat May 23 12:30:17 2015 UTC,"Nothing happens. The player is locked in place and the game fades to black and reloads your last save / autosave. Killing the enemies in this area was never meant to be possible so nothing is triggered once they are all dead. Half of them aren't even models and are using sprites instead, due to system limitations of the late 90s."
HalfLife,36xlm0,urbanebula,1 point,Fri May 22 23:31:25 2015 UTC,"Nothing happens, the screen just slowly fades to black, it doesn't actually involve you seeing Gordon die, that happens off screen.

HalfLife,36vy51,Akrappa,10,Fri May 22 15:35:04 2015 UTC,"Combines first priority and interest is taking new species into the fold. They're basically like the Borg only less 90s design sensibility. They make 'synths' from raw materials. Breen was tasked with developing a demonstration of the best humanity could have to offer, and to be a Human representative so humanity themselves has some voice in the manner of their integration. The result of his efforts was The Overwatch forces you spend the game embarrassing. Stalkers and Cremators may also be his designs or his fault at least, or they may be some other faction/entity in The Combines competing vision of humanities future."
HalfLife,36vy51,eugd,7,Fri May 22 15:47:58 2015 UTC,"The Combine is not mainly interested in elimination as they are in assimilation. This is where the Combine's name comes from and is why humanity still exists. To be honest though, humanity probably was seen as too weak by the Combine, so if Breen had not made the case that he did, humanity could've been wiped out easily. As you see, however, it has not been wiped out, but instead, humanity has been either forced into slave labour or assimilated into the ranks of the Combine, while all of Earth's resources are drained and used."
HalfLife,36vy51,Gondile,6,Fri May 22 18:46:36 2015 UTC,"It's a mixture of things. While the Combine will assimilate any species they want, Dr. Breen intervened from killing all of humanity, and instead making us slaves. To them [the species at the top, probably Advisors], something is only worth what can be had from it. They're only interested in Earth for its resources, and they have renewed interest because of the Borealis.  The Overwatch are ""The best humanity has to offer."" Some of them are voluntary, some are involuntary. While not part of the overwatch, Metrocops are entirely voluntary members of the military. They're also entirely human, too, as evidenced by their radio chatter. They tend to do a lot of it.  There are two kinds of slaves: Normal humans, who do what they're told and work what they're told, willingly or not. Barr the resistance members, of course.  Stalkers: Unwilling humans who have been transformed into brainless slaves with no memory by the combine.  Breen's feelings on this are tricky. There's no true consensus on why he did what he did: I personally think it was because he genuinely wanted humanity to thrive.  Can I ask why you're doing your thesis on Half Life?"
HalfLife,36vy51,kingkolton9,0,Fri May 22 19:54:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for the very complete answer. Basically the thesis had not to be ""professional"" so one can chose anything.

HalfLife,36vy51,Empty_Allocution,1 point,Sat May 23 18:00:36 2015 UTC,"Breen negotiated Earth's surrender. That is why people are still around. If Breen hadn't of made those negotiations, the entire human race would probably have been forcefully assimilated into the ranks of the Combine."

HalfLife,36uc1k,Riomaki,23,Fri May 22 05:45:31 2015 UTC,"I'd wager they'd have orders to silence them as well. Given how the military seemed to have been deployed to cover up the incident thinking they could contain it, the Civvies would have been the only witness (apart from the Marines) that would have survived with BM being in a desolate area. They probably wouldn't want people running around claiming they survived an alien invasion."
HalfLife,36uc1k,ServeMyBreakfast,2,Fri May 22 07:09:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the ramifications of the G-Man's statement lead down a pretty dark road.  I've thought about Alyx's presence at Black Mesa too and figured, well, she couldn't have been the only kid there.  There's a deeply twisted BioShock-style map idea in there, I'm sure.  I mean, can you imagine the G-Man warping himself into the play pen and picking up Alyx while leaving everyone else behind?  It's pretty messed up, and seeing as we never did much with this information, it's a bit unfortunate that they wrote it into the canon.  It is an unnecessarily disturbing little detail.

HalfLife,36uc1k,Gondile,3,Fri May 22 14:26:50 2015 UTC,"I guess a simple thought is that the people topside were the first to get wiped out by the military.

Either way they were probably the first ones to find out the hard way that evac was coming in the form of death."

Eli is the guy who lets you through the door into the control room right after the resonance cascade, so the only way I can reasonably imagine him getting Alyx out of there is with some pretty serious intervention from the Gman. All of this was of course shoehorned into in as lore retcons for connectivity's sake, because otherwise HL2 could have been called Fallout Effect 7: Human Revolution for all it has to do with the original plot, but it was done in such a way that none of it seems too contrived.

THink about it, valve doesnt release even a sigle game, (original ones left 4 dead, n stuff)  but, instead, develops hardware, VR and a new controller, so the fact is, they don't have innovation in their software tecnology, something that half-life always had... let's face it..."
HalfLife,36nve7,EngineerDogIta,22,Thu May 21 08:51:00 2015 UTC,"Not many companies go to EA to show off hardware. Source 2 is being released later this year, and you don't release a new engine without a premier game to show it off. It's like coming out with a new Xbox without any games to premier it with. (Sound familiar.)  Remember, there is only one Original Valve Game that is meant to show off new engines.  Remember, every time Gabe Newell attended E3, it was for a new game.  It may not say he is attending the main event, but remember, when they announced Portal 2, it didn't say he was attending at all, a complete surprise. The fact that he is going to a PRE E3 show is convincing. It is also hopeful, considering that this video was NOT meant to be shown to the public.  Yes, I and countless others have said this over and over in the past, but everything is pointing to it now. There are simply to many things happening to NOT suspect it.  Even if it doesn't come out right now, why be disappointed? It is GOING to come out, there is no doubt in that. Whether it be soon, or in years to come, it WILL happen. Anyone who thinks otherwise are misguided by past disappointment."
HalfLife,36nve7,tgkennedy,2,Wed May 20 22:09:50 2015 UTC,"Companies bring hardware all the time. The first appearance of the Wii U at E3 featured no actual games, just tech demos. Oculus Rift and various Virtual Reality peripherals like the Morpheus were at E3 just last year and were among the most popular booths, again just with tech demos. I was there.   With the release of Steam Boxes, Steam Link, The Vive, and the new Steam Controller later in the year, it is very likely that is what Valve will be showcasing. It's not some golden rule where you have to release a game with new hardware, especially for PC where many games are compatible.  I'm not saying it's not possible a new game will be announced. I just think Valve is focused on too many other things at the moment to throw it in to the mix."

Beyond that, Facebook, HTC, Valve, and Sony all clearly care a lot, and many developers are quite interested in doing VR.

It'll send you to one of the secret Xen areas where you can find some medkits/batteries as well as some Tau Cannon and Flare Gun ammo.   If you're still having trouble, go to the northernmost house and you should find a Lambda Cache past a couple Combine Snowsoldiers with some more medkits. Hope this helps!"

HalfLife,36n8kb,SlappyCromwell,5,Wed May 20 19:34:39 2015 UTC,The lack of content available on the old Wikia is not due to anyone removing content but rather due to the fact that it was abandoned years ago while the OverWiki continues its goal of maintaining a growing and definitive compendium of all Half-Life knowledge that is run by and for the community.
HalfLife,36n8kb,kingkolton9,-6,Wed May 20 23:13:55 2015 UTC,"The lack of content available on the old Wikia is not due to anyone removing content   False. I made 100% accurate edits and cited them and they were removed, saying that I should have asked around before doing it.   it was abandoned years ago   Yet it's still up and being edited.   OverWiki has continued its goal of maintaining a growing and definitive compendium of all Half-Life knowledge that is run by and for the community.   That sounds like propaganda.  The Half Life wiki can do that, too. There is literally nothing wrong with using the Half Life wiki. The only reason it was decrepit in the first place is because the creators of overwiki were butthurt about muhads. All of the problems that the Half Life wiki has are because the overwiki didn't like wikia. You act like overwiki is special. It's not."

Of the people who use wiki, many have an account. Of those that don't, a huge amount use adblock. It's not ""most users."" At the most, I'd say it's 30%. Wikia is not one of the worst informational sites on the internet. It's one of the most informational ""sites"" on the internet.  ""Wikia wields its immense search engine influence to make it difficult for community wikis to break away from them and escape this.""  So?  ""The way Wikia operates is quite sinister.""  ""They host out bullshit for free and only ask that people who don't sign up use ads! They're popular! Waaaaaaaah! Fuck Wikia!""  It's not difficult for community wikis to ""break away"" from them, nor do I see legitimate reasons to do so. You are not contractually bound to use wikia, you're free to use media wiki, and Wikia helps your wiki become more popular.  What? You think if Media Wiki was as big as Wikia they wouldn't do the same ""sinister"" things? Bullshit.   Even Wikipedia, behind the scenes, is a cesspool of power-hungry admins doing childish things, to the point I'm amazed anything gets done. It's amazing.  The only semi-good reason Combineoverwiki had for moving was the fact that wikia has ads. If they truly have so much disdain for wikia, I have to ask why many of the admins on over wiki maintain their adminship on Halflife wiki.

The HL2 articles are equally improved as well."

That's precisely why I cleaned it up. Part of the OverWiki's goal is to completely revamp poor and cluttered articles that are difficult to comprehend. Trivia sections, in particular, had reached a point of critical mass where they were exceeding the actual content of the page. Excess and pointless baggage does not improve an article. This is, of course, known as quality over quantity. It also doesn't help that the Wikia page includes a vast amount of totally wild and baseless speculation that flies in the face of established official sources (see the ""2000 or 2001"" date declaration early in the text).  If you're looking for more comparisons, see the OverWiki's Race X article and Wikia's outdated version. Note how one is thorough both in its coverage and providing valid citations while the other is littered with inaccurate and misleading speculation."

HalfLife,36oool,Wawawawaluigi,10,Wed May 20 22:38:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think of Valve as a ""AAA"" developer. I consider Valve a ""Major League"" developer. Companies like Bethesda and Valve are part of the ""Major League"" in my mind.  Companies who are big for the sake of being big are ""AAA,"" like EA.  But, that aside aside: Yes, it will. Half Life will be the next Crysis of graphics. Detail and thought have been severely lacking in major games recently, simply to churn game after game out. Keep in mind, guys, that Half Life 2's physics engine is 10 years old and yet still outperforms almost every other one. Supposedly, Valve is ramping that quality up to 11 with Source 2. At least for a while, I think Half Life 3 is going to be Valve's magnum opus. They've had years to study player behavior, level design, psychology, re-do plots, graphics, scripts, voice acting, re-work and retool the engine, port it, rework and remake mechanics, create new ones, rewrite the game,  and so on and so forth. Considering this is a title that people who have never even played the games know about, I think this is also going to be Valve's middle finger to those that said they can't do it."
HalfLife,36oool,kingkolton9,5,Thu May 21 01:29:19 2015 UTC,"In many ways, I doubt it.  It's hard for me to believe that HL3 would pull out some amazing innovative new thing that no one else has done, especially with the indie scene creating and consuming ideas like no one's business.  However, what it would do, it would do extraordinarily well.  And in a time when triple-As are faltering, perhaps that's all it needs to do.  You don't see many triple-A games anymore that feel lovingly crafted with an immaculate attention to detail and fun.  Instead, they are churned out by a machine year after year.  With Valve, owing to the fact that it has exceptionally talented employees and long development schedules, you can feel the craftsmanship in their work.  That human touch which is missing from your yearly Call of Duties and Assassins Creeds."
HalfLife,36oool,Riomaki,1 point,Thu May 21 01:09:10 2015 UTC,"We'd have to know what it is, what it will be about, to have any hope of saying. Of course that will be their goal with it, but can lightning strike thrice? Probably not if it's just yet another refinement of the linear cinematic FPS. Arguably HL2 also innovated physics in videogames (only arguably because really prior games had done havoc physics clutter just as well, just not with the killer app of the gravity gun to give it meaning and memorability), and maybe that's something HL3/Source 2 can repeat. Actually it's something I'm really hopeful for, seeing as they're now making their own in-house physics engine 'Rubikon'. If Valve can 'solve' videogame physics (finally put an end to the common problems of Havok, namely objects winding up inside each other and freaking out) that would be a pretty huge boon to gaming and especially VR (where I'd imagine a conventional physics glitch would be a fucking terrifying experience)."

The Combine, now freaking out at the first breach in likely forever, try to scramble to the intruder, but are unable to pinpoint one man inside their vast capital. As Gordon goes through the alien world, he looks upon all the other aliens and worlds that have been ravaged and destroyed by the Combine. Eventually, he reaches the boss himself, the Combine Overlord. After a long, painful battle, the Overlord is defeated.

That he's going to get to put the crowbar down and put the HEV suit in the closet.  That he'll get whatever version of normalcy is possible for a one-man army who was literally in limbo for 20 years.  What happens with all good warriors?  They either find the peace they seek at the end of the battle, or they are destroyed by the lack of it.  I would like to think Gordon would be put into the first category rather than the second, mostly because the latter is so unsatisfying.  There is a point, and I think given some of Gaben's comments this will remain accurate, when the hero in any story has his moment of doubt; ""how much more of this do I have to live through?""  There is a fleeting hope there.  Like there can be an end.  And I think that's ultimately the goal with the gameplay.  And then we'll get to the top of the mountain and find a way home.  I guess the real question is, similar to the two categories above, is Gordon Sam or is he Frodo -- can he stay in the Shire or does he need to go off because he can no longer survive there?  I'd like to see him stay on Earth and get back into a lab coat.  All of those hours in the driver's seat as an arm with a crowbar, and I'd like to see him put it down.

HalfLife,36kixk,imaghostbescared,2,Wed May 20 02:26:43 2015 UTC,Not everything. I seem to recall there was a plan a while back in which  Half Life 3 would be the final chapter in one particular story arch. Meaning that we may get more games in the same universe. Possibly meaning we won't get answers for G-Man or what happens to the Vortigaunts/Combine.  Lemme look for where I heard that.
HalfLife,36kixk,Froggmann5,1 point,Wed May 20 08:56:07 2015 UTC,"I expect more about the Borealis, and explanation of the connection between Vortigaunts and the G-Man. But personally I would like to see more of the Combine explained, because they're really cool."

We might also learn more about the Combine Advisors, or just the Combine in general, since it seems that Advisors will be an enemy in Episode 3 (at least I hope). But Valve's big card that they might play is the G-Man. I doubt they'll reveal too much about him, since they want to keep him enigmatic as a character, but I'm sure we'll receive some closure."

HalfLife,36fze9,nihilinth,3,Tue May 19 02:52:50 2015 UTC,"I found them surprisingly easy to dodge. And one to two magnum shots, depending on how much of a sharpshooter I was, was usually enough to kill them."

HalfLife,36fze9,nihilinth,6,Tue May 19 13:23:50 2015 UTC,"Still, a shot cone of 135º instead of 50º is a pretty dramatic change.  I actually think the Vortigaunt's problem before wasn't accuracy, but rather the time it takes for them to ""see"" you and attack.  Cutting down that delay would help across the board."

HalfLife,36fze9,kingkolton9,4,Tue May 19 07:13:43 2015 UTC,"I can understand nihilinth's point.  The Gargantua doesn't have any weight in his steps.  He just skips effortlessly around the area.  That's a criticism I'd level against all of Black Mesa's ""new"" AI, be they Gargantuas or HECU or Houndeyes.  They glide around and have no weight in the world when they move.  It's like you're fighting Quake or Unreal deathmatch bots instead of AI that's trying to feel realistic and rooted in the world."
HalfLife,36fze9,Riomaki,2,Tue May 19 15:07:51 2015 UTC,"So? The whole Combine spiel is that they are artificial, but uncannily organic/"

HalfLife,36eaab,Rovanion,3,Tue May 19 10:13:00 2015 UTC,"My question was: ""isn't e3 meant to be mainly about games?""  Not: ""isn't e3 meant to be mainly about things that are about games?""  Edit: Phrased it better."
HalfLife,36eaab,DennisvdG,3,Tue May 19 10:17:07 2015 UTC,"As a previous commenter said.   They absolutely revealed not only Tony Hawk's stupid skateboard peripheral, Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Rock Band the Beatles edition one, but also the Kinect and Playstation Eye at E3, so it's not unheard of.   So you can absolutely come to E3 and talk about the new games that are made possible by the Vive."
HalfLife,36eaab,Rovanion,1 point,Tue May 19 17:53:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, I never disagreed with that. I said ""isn't it still mainly about games?"""
HalfLife,36eaab,DennisvdG,2,Tue May 19 18:11:44 2015 UTC,And I never disagreed that it's mainly about games. Doesn't mean that they can't come there and talk about the Vive and the games associated with it; not the game we know as Ricochet 2.
HalfLife,36eaab,Rovanion,2,Tue May 19 19:15:28 2015 UTC,"Yep, for sure. I was just thinking that maybe it'd be a bit weird if they show of this cool tech with tons of potential but not show any games whatsoever..."

HalfLife,36eaab,u83rmensch,1 point,Tue May 19 03:33:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, believe all you want but it's only reasonable it's going to be about Vive and the brand new gaming experience that's going to be virtual reality."
HalfLife,36eaab,Rovanion,14,Tue May 19 10:04:52 2015 UTC,"Something like this happens every single year, and nothing ever comes of it. It's amazing how some people still manage to lap this stuff up! Also, considering Will Wright doesn't even make video-games anymore, this ""leak"" doesn't really seem that plausible."
HalfLife,36eaab,Literally_Death,12,Mon May 18 21:05:30 2015 UTC,"I'm willing to get hyped. The inevitable crash doesn't phase me any more... It doesn't really happen. Just a shrug, and an ""Oh well."""

Don't fuck it up by saying, ""It has to mean they're announcing a game,"" and then proceed to not back that up with any substantial information."
HalfLife,36eaab,smashitup,9,Tue May 19 02:17:31 2015 UTC,So true. It's a clickbait channel that sources unreliable information at best and most times fail to provide any sources to back it up.
HalfLife,36eaab,woodshop20,6,Tue May 19 09:52:50 2015 UTC,And most of the time it's just regurgitated information that everyone has known about for the past few weeks.
HalfLife,36eaab,Dynomite333,1 point,Tue May 19 13:02:34 2015 UTC,And the worst is that the information he cites has already started being refuted by NeoGAF members stating that the names on the supposed leak are probably placeholders.
HalfLife,36eaab,ispeelgood,8,Wed May 20 04:34:19 2015 UTC,I will not believe anything until I actually beat HL3. Only then will I believe the game came out.
HalfLife,36eaab,TheOneFreeMan002,8,Mon May 18 22:48:10 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I'll even believe it then. I'll probably be on my deathbed 50 or 60 years from now thinking 'Did it really happen?  Was it all just a dream? Did I even play Half Life 3?'
HalfLife,36eaab,Toxyoi,2,Tue May 19 00:25:07 2015 UTC,"wakes up after 30 year coma  Half-Life 3 was indeed released, but Valve closed 20 years later and there is no longer any way to get the game"

They only every showed up at E3 when they have something very special in the works.  I don't think it's Portal related; that story is over.  I don't think it's Left For Dead related; the plantation leak was of a remake.  All aboard!"
HalfLife,36eaab,teuast,16,Mon May 18 18:57:43 2015 UTC,"I've been saying to expect something big here ever since they announced Source 2 at GDC, and everybody's been laughing at me, but if it turns out I was right all along then I will be rubbing it in all of y'all's faces for the next several months."
HalfLife,36eaab,kingkolton9,3,Mon May 18 21:22:41 2015 UTC,"Well, not my face. I agreed with you a while back that Source 2 meant something big. Granted, I think they'll release something on Source 2 to test the waters, first."
HalfLife,36eaab,wallyflops,2,Tue May 19 02:14:28 2015 UTC,"When is e3? I follow the CSGO community quite closely and they haven't updated anything in a very long time, the CSGO fans are saying that 'something big' is coming..."

HalfLife,36eaab,ispeelgood,0,Mon May 18 22:38:47 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, it doesn't even have to be a special day with Valve. Just another Tuesday. Look at my comment from the unrealistic assumption that they're coming to E3."
HalfLife,36eaab,mechanical_animal,3,Mon May 18 19:39:59 2015 UTC,Well Dota 2 still hasn't received the full engine upgrade release(aka Source 2) which was slated for the first half of 2015. E3 will be in mid June so there is still time for something interesting to be debuted.
HalfLife,36eaab,ispeelgood,2,Mon May 18 20:35:48 2015 UTC,Valve time probably happened to Dota 2 Source 2. I think they're gonna release it after The International. It would probably be too dangerous for their time schedule to release it now.
HalfLife,36eaab,swanston99,2,Wed May 20 04:40:01 2015 UTC,I think they're gonna release it after The International. It would probably be too dangerous for their time schedule to release it now.   How so?
HalfLife,36eaab,monstergert,2,Wed May 20 04:50:04 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not an expert in huge event hosting but unexpected bugs/exploits could surface at any time, plus if they have to go through the ""release test client get feedback release new test client"" process the Source 2 version might not be up to par with the current version in time for the event. Do note that I'm mostly speaking out of my ass and perhaps Valve Time might be subverted."

We'll have a nice demo in about a year.  That's not a hard deadline.  But anyway, here is a rough demo.""  They could then show us part of a level from Half-Life 2 or Portal 2 rendered in Source 2, with amped up physics or whatever that monster will be capable in its simplest application.  And then at the end all Gabe would need to say is ""we know who our base is.  And we still love you.  And we're still in the kitchen for you.""  That would be good enough for me until they're ready."

HalfLife,36jkxc,Trenchman,1 point,Tue May 19 23:29:32 2015 UTC,"If you took this chronological thing seriously you'd have to play Blue Shift first, then Half-Life, then Decay, then Opposing Force. Then you'd have to wait a few years/decades before you could play HL2. :P It really doesn't matter, at the end of the day.  I don't see why you'd be disappointed by playing Blue Shift after Opposing Force, though. It's still a perfectly good Half-Life game and the notion that it was in any way bad is kind of an exaggerated misrepresentation of how it plays and what people actually think of it. Episode One sometimes gets the same sort of treatment but the truth is it isn't really as good as what came before and after it, so there it's a little justified."
HalfLife,36jkxc,nihilinth,1 point,Wed May 20 09:38:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, because I do like Blue Shift a lot. And actually think Episode 1 has some of the best gameplay in the entire series.

HalfLife,36jkxc,Trenchman,2,Wed May 20 14:20:55 2015 UTC,"Episode One did have some really great gameplay and some really cool new mechanics, but you also had issues like Lowlife being a bit too long and Exit 17 being probably the most uninteresting and anti-climactic end chapter in the entire series.  Well, as long as one keeps the right distance from it and go into it knowing what it is and isn't (it was intended as a mere sidestory within the Dreamcast port of HL1; it was not conceived as a full-fledged expansion), one shouldn't get too disappointed."
HalfLife,36jkxc,HalfLife1MasterRace,0,Wed May 20 17:00:52 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really matter what order you play Op4, BS, and Decay. They all overlap each other and the original, there isn't really a ""chronological order"" ingame. For instance, Blue Shift ends where Chapter 10 of Half-Life begins, and Op4's chapter 6 begins when Half-Life's Chapter 15 begins. As for Decay, you can see Barney falling through a void at the end of the game, so it can be assumed that they end at similar times."

And Gman is impressed. Sorry, but I don't think Gman would be impressed with Gordon, saying he has ""limitless potential"" if he was pissed that he killed the Nihilanth. Anyways, why would the Gman not just teleport Gordon away to stasis before killing the Nihilanth, or teleport him into the 9th portal in the tower?"
HalfLife,36f52q,iamanrock,6,Mon May 18 22:17:05 2015 UTC,"It's potentially a quality of life update.  Valve seems committed to the idea that TF2, CSGO and DOTA2 are ongoing, evolving games.  As graphics technology improves, having an updated engine that is designed to exploit it is necessary.  I suspect, as hinted by DOTA2, that we'd see these games slowly migrate over to Source 2.  I also think that Valve ""not making games anymore"" is an incorrect assumption.  I seriously doubt Half-Life is among them, but I believe they always have something in the pipeline.  Right now, the company has an unhealthy fascination with monetization schemes, so I would expect their next game to be something that fully exploits that."
HalfLife,36f52q,Riomaki,3,Tue May 19 15:32:46 2015 UTC,"Wasn't HL2 the first major launch title for the Source 1 engine?

HalfLife,36f52q,washout77,1 point,Tue May 19 17:47:05 2015 UTC,"I'd say they would if they could, but they most likely can't. Delaying the release of their new engine for years just to have it come out together with HL3 to uphold a ""tradition"" would simply be silly."

HalfLife,36f0iv,GuyWithTooMuchTime,2,Tue May 19 22:34:11 2015 UTC,"Some people can't stand old graphics. That's not me, but it's some people. The music and sounds matter a lot to me in both HL1 and HL2 so I want to show people that you can get these mods to appreciate what HL1 did while still being able to enjoy the modern Black Mesa. I really do think The Hobbit and LOTR is a good example between HL1 and HL2. Overall playing HL1 doesn't make a big difference to HL2, but if you notice the key points in where the HL1 music is played in HL2, it's nice.   I realize most people don't necessarily agree with me on these mods, but I know we can all agree that although Black Mesa's music is amazing and top notch, there's certain points where HL1 music fits the glove better on the tone. An example would be the Valve theme that plays on the cliff side battle compared to the Black Mesa song that plays."

HalfLife,36f3ol,Mackerdaymia,1 point,Tue May 19 20:26:50 2015 UTC,Remember we don't know the G-man's motives. He might have brought Freeman back when he did to show him the consequences of his actions. He could be trying to torment him or push him over the edge. Who knows? Personally I liked the mysterious set-up in HL2 and thought the bit where the Vortigaunts 'took' Freeman from the G-man in HL2Ep2 was a bit lame.
HalfLife,36f3ol,HalfLife1MasterRace,1 point,Tue May 19 07:53:07 2015 UTC,"I thought it was implied that the G-Man basically handpicked survivors from Black Mesa when Eli mentions him in HL2Ep2. They didn't have to survive the nuke, they were plucked from the facility before it went off."

Those who were supposed to survive as designated by the G-Man for whatever reason survived, and those who were extraneous did not.   I mean it's said that G-Man isn't a fan of the combine, urging Gordon to fight. So isn't it possible that the G-Man orchestrated the Cascade so that the Combine would notice Earth and invade, all so that the G-Man could have Gordon spearhead the efforts to destroy them (eventually, has yet to be seen).  Of course, this is all speculation and I'm still fairly new to the series"

HalfLife,36f6me,Rockden66,1 point,Thu May 21 19:01:49 2015 UTC,"Both of the games are utterly fantastic, in my opinion. It's no doubt that Opposing Force is the better of the two in the eyes of many, as is widely accepted by many fans of the series, however Blue Shift nearly if not just as good. Opposing Force showcases a PLETHORA of weapons, including my all-time favorite, the Shockroach. Blue Shift on the other hand doesn't really have too much new for weapons, however they scrap the HEV stations in leu of picking up security guard armor from corpses and other locations, with (if I recall correctly) vests giving 70 armor and helmets giving 30 (could be wrong on that)  Both games introduce ""Race X,"" which is a sub-species of aliens created by Gearbox, and is non-canon with the Half-Life franchise. However, if you're like me and love the idea of a second group of aliens invading at the same time as the Resonance Cascade, you /could/ say that Race X died out during the 7 Hour War, with the Combine eradicating them (leaving headcrabs alive for their own personal use, and Vortigaunts being too intelligent to be beaten to extinction)  Overall, both of the games are well deserving of placement among the Half-Life series, and missing out on them is a big loss in my personal opinion.  ALSO  The Training mission for Opposing Force is DIFFERENT from the ones from HL1 and Blue Shift, and is actually quite entertaining. I recommend it for the full experience.  Happy playing!"

There are so many areas you can leave it at, complete a part of a chapter/huge chunk/all of the chapter, grab it and keep going. It's not only easier than the gnome achievement, but I found myself enjoying this achievement. Not to mention that you can get pretty much every other achievement on your way.  Some tips:   Do a healthy amount of actual saving and quicksaving. I had to try this achievement 4 times because auto saves overwrite quicksaves. Save at the start and end of every chapter and quick save in-between. You can also start at unforseen consequences and skip the first 2 chapters. During the teleporter sequence lay the hat down by the steps. Continuously long jump, avoiding any enemies. You save on ammo for the start of Xen (when it comes out), you have higher health and armor than if you fight and you can just pick up the hat and jump in.   This guide goes into more detail."

You can see that these teleports are part of a grand attempt at invasion with combined arms tactics and Alien Grunt footsoldiers; the HECU are in full retreat, and you're still forcing your way through the cracks. You see Xen's biological tech, like its Snark Mines and Hivehand, more hints at this being an organised, intelligent faction.  HL2 just kind of plonked you into the story right away, with characters monologuing at you inside locked rooms about ze Evil Combine, though there are opportunities to see this for yourself like the CP's mistreatment of Civilians and the Combine's use of Headcrab shells. I feel like it was pushed on me instead of letting me find it myself."
HalfLife,369mnl,Orgy_In_The_Moonbase,14,Sun May 17 17:46:08 2015 UTC,"This is very true.  As much as people loved HL2's talkie bits when it first came out, we all have to acknowledge that they are basically unskippable cutscenes.  There are very few areas in HL1 that were like this.  The game keeps moving forward.  You can digest the story on your own terms instead of having to stand around and watch carefully choreographed cutscenes."
HalfLife,369mnl,pie_man33,7,Sun May 17 19:30:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, it seems Half-Life 2 fell into the (at the time) relatively new trap of a ""cinematic storyline"" rather than Half-Life's method of making it feel like the story is designed for a video game format. The gameplay is first and obvious, whereas the storyline is secondhand but still very interesting if you're willing to look for it."
HalfLife,369mnl,0818,3,Sun May 17 17:53:39 2015 UTC,"Great post. Also listening to the marine chatter (""who is this freeman?"" ""all I know he's been killing my buddies!""), seeing the dyslexic graffiti (die freemen).   One thing that bothered me about HL2 dialogue, they sometime were cringe-worthy cheesy. ""About that beer I owed you!"", ""What cat?"", ""You left this at Black Mesa!"" (the crowbar) etc."
HalfLife,369mnl,mynameisdave,5,Mon May 18 07:59:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that and many other things in HL2 made me feel like Valve is winking at you and pointing with a wide grin like ""get it? get it? aren't we smart for including references to HL1?""  Also some of the big action scenes with badass music and helicopters and rockets chasing you just make me feel like I'm supposed to do something and there's no way I can stop now to explore, and that I can either do exactly what I'm supposed to or die, or miss out on the action or something.  In HL1, things happen because of what you do. In HL2, things happen and you're expected to play along the way they intended."
HalfLife,369mnl,SuperWeegee4000,3,Mon May 18 12:26:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, HL2 pretty much holds your hand throughout the game, especially on the Episodes with Alyx."

HalfLife,369mnl,freeman_reborn,-12,Wed May 27 17:16:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I tell most people to start with Half-Life 2.  Let's be honest-- the original Half-Life has aged like spoiled milk. A lot of people who grew up with the newer generations of games probably won't find the original Half-Life as interesting as old timers."
HalfLife,369mnl,Cyspha,18,Sun May 17 16:07:27 2015 UTC,"A game that is 15+ years old is bound to look old to be honest. It's like you're surprised that your newborn is a teenager by now :P  Edit: And I don't know how many people feel this way, but I'm 17 years old and still play old games, despite not growing up with them. I love HL1, I play the original XCOM, Doom 1 from time to time (but mostly with mods) and on LAN parties we all have no problem playing games like CS 1.6 or Age of Empires, or Quake or Halo.   I'd say a lot of people would still play older games, you just have to give them a reason. I think starting with HL2 for newer players might not be a bad idea, since it may or may not spark interest in the older games, rather than turning the players off with ""bad"" graphics. I like it :)"
HalfLife,369mnl,HypnoToad0,9,Sun May 17 16:14:28 2015 UTC,"I mean, Black Mesa is popular for a reason-- it helps the new generation familiarize themselves with a game that they were incapable of doing so before.  Still, I started with Half-Life 2 and I certainly don't regret it. It's a lot more of an eyecatcher than the original."
HalfLife,369mnl,tsahyt,7,Sun May 17 16:26:01 2015 UTC,"As ""the new generation"" I still have no problem playing retro games. As long as it runs at a proper resolution, framerate, and with proper controls, I have no problem playing a game."
HalfLife,369mnl,MonkahBoy,3,Sun May 17 17:20:53 2015 UTC,"Yup, I agree with you there. Downloaded HL1 a long time ago, never bothered with it, then felt the urge to purchase it on Steam a couple of months ago. Played the shit out of HL1 and then played HL2. Incredible."
HalfLife,369mnl,tsahyt,3,Sun May 17 19:12:31 2015 UTC,"I really don't like this whole concept that game remakes ""replace"" the original (say the same about movies on Reddit and you'd basically be crucified).  Black Mesa takes the scenarios and characters of Half-Life and makes a completely new work. New puzzles, new art, new design - more accessible, sure, but also different enough that I'd recommend playing both."

The ""New York"" theme was the alpha version. In fact, at the time of the leak, many of the things were already changed."

Episode 1 takes place in the desert trying to escape the explosion and episode 2 would end just when the Combine arrive, leaving you with a cliffhanger. Meanwhile, everyone is waiting for Half Life 2 to be released so we can finish the story.  But those episodes never happened, and Half Life 2 did get released.

HalfLife,36aznh,crazyrich,7,Sun May 17 22:17:32 2015 UTC,There really aren't any... You can play Half-Life 2: Update though. (free download for hl2 owners I believe) It's Half Life 2 except with lots of bug fixes and improved lighting and particle effects.

We really don't need to see you typing in console commands, or opening the console at all. You can bind commands to keys in the console such as noclip to save time.  We also don't need to see you changing maps in the console, or passing through changelevels to see or hear things.   In the case of the Gman briefcase, it would have been much simpler to just show a picture of the inner briefcase texture which is easily viewable with the Half-Life model viewer.   My suggestion is that you simply cut the length down to keep it interesting and fun."

Maybe try Borderlands since Gearbox developed the HL1 expansion packs, but they feel pretty different compared to Half-Life games."

HalfLife,368k1y,HalfLife1MasterRace,3,Sun May 17 13:46:01 2015 UTC,The gameplay of Bioshock 2 is hard to beat. Even those that didn't like the story are usually drawn back to the gameplay.

HalfLife,368k1y,TheCyberDoctor1,1 point,Sun May 17 20:18:47 2015 UTC,I think Infinite is dumbed down compared to BS1 as much as BS1 dumbed down to System Shock 2. To appeal mostly console masses.

Its OK, I guess. I just hate how fuckin grey it is. Its so fucking grey, I can't stand it.  Bioshock. Doesn't have many puzzles, if you don't count the hacking mini-games. Combat is alright.  System Shock 2. Its good. Play it.  Doom 3 was released at around the same time HL2 was. Its not like the Classic Doom games (to the dismay of Doom fans).  The new Shadow Warrior is really good. Its more combat focused, though."
HalfLife,368k1y,doublicon,2,Sun May 17 08:18:41 2015 UTC,"To add on to System Shock 2 style of games, consider Deus Ex. It's got a very similar, ""bad stuff in the background"" feel. Lots of weird mysteries to unravel. Deus Ex: Human Revolution is also very entertaining, though it feels more constrained than the original game."

The first time through, when I got back to Hengsha the second time and we got shot down and Faridah told me to run, I listened to her and then she died, and holy fuck it blindsided the shit out of me, I could barely sleep that night. I beat the game, then Googled to find out what happened to her because apparently I'm fucking blind, then went back and loaded my save from the Detroit riots so I could go back and rescue her. I feel like the game designers screwed up somewhere when I ended up caring more about Faridah than Megan, but that's how it goes, you know?  I'm not all that sure about the premise of Mankind Divided, but it's from the same people, so it's probably going to be at least decent."

HalfLife,366gok,2-4601,12,Sat May 16 18:27:58 2015 UTC,"Yea, after some research I found it, complete.   Let me read a letter I recently received. ""Dear Dr. Breen. Why has the Combine seen fit to suppress our reproductive cycle? Sincerely, A Concerned Citizen.""    Thank you for writing, Concerned. Of course your question touches on one of the basic biological impulses, with all its associated hopes and fears for the future of the species. I also detect some unspoken questions. Do our benefactors really know what's best for us? What gives them the right to make this kind of decision for mankind? Will they ever deactivate the suppression field and let us breed again?   Allow me to address the anxieties underlying your concerns, rather than try to answer every possible question you might have left unvoiced. First, let us consider the fact that for the first time ever, as a species, immortality is in our reach. This simple fact has far-reaching implications. It requires radical rethinking and revision of our genetic imperatives. It also requires planning and forethought that run in direct opposition to our neural pre-sets.   I find it helpful at times like these to remind myself that our true enemy is Instinct. Instinct was our mother when we were an infant species. Instinct coddled us and kept us safe in those hardscrabble years when we hardened our sticks and cooked our first meals above a meager fire and started at the shadows that leapt upon the cavern's walls. But inseparable from Instinct is its dark twin, Superstition. Instinct is inextricably bound to unreasoning impulses, and today we clearly see its true nature. Instinct has just become aware of its irrelevance, and like a cornered beast, it will not go down without a bloody fight. Instinct would inflict a fatal injury on our species. Instinct creates its own oppressors, and bids us rise up against them. Instinct tells us that the unknown is a threat, rather than an opportunity. Instinct slyly and covertly compels us away from change and progress. Instinct, therefore, must be expunged. It must be fought tooth and nail, beginning with the basest of human urges: The urge to reproduce.   We should thank our benefactors for giving us respite from this overpowering force. They have thrown a switch and exorcised our demons in a single stroke. They have given us the strength we never could have summoned to overcome this compulsion. They have given us purpose. They have turned our eyes toward the stars.   Let me assure you that the suppressing field will be shut off on the day that we have mastered ourselves...the day we can prove we no longer need it. And that day of transformation, I have it on good authority, is close at hand."
HalfLife,366gok,doublicon,4,Sat May 16 19:53:38 2015 UTC,"This argument makes a lot more sense if you read the BreenGrub's Tweets, by the way - basically, the Advisor grub's species become single-mindedly obsessed with mating and die on doing it come the breeding season, so for them being able to put it off would be a godsend."
HalfLife,366gok,supremecrafters,4,Sat May 16 22:00:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly, but he probably followed that up with his ""instinct argument""."
HalfLife,366gok,Xeotroid,2,Sat May 16 18:10:43 2015 UTC,"Yea, after some research I found it, complete.   Let me read a letter I recently received. ""Dear Dr. Breen. Why has the Combine seen fit to suppress our reproductive cycle? Sincerely, A Concerned Citizen.""    Thank you for writing, Concerned. Of course your question touches on one of the basic biological impulses, with all its associated hopes and fears for the future of the species. I also detect some unspoken questions. Do our benefactors really know what's best for us? What gives them the right to make this kind of decision for mankind? Will they ever deactivate the suppression field and let us breed again?   Allow me to address the anxieties underlying your concerns, rather than try to answer every possible question you might have left unvoiced. First, let us consider the fact that for the first time ever, as a species, immortality is in our reach. This simple fact has far-reaching implications. It requires radical rethinking and revision of our genetic imperatives. It also requires planning and forethought that run in direct opposition to our neural pre-sets.   I find it helpful at times like these to remind myself that our true enemy is Instinct. Instinct was our mother when we were an infant species. Instinct coddled us and kept us safe in those hardscrabble years when we hardened our sticks and cooked our first meals above a meager fire and started at the shadows that leapt upon the cavern's walls. But inseparable from Instinct is its dark twin, Superstition. Instinct is inextricably bound to unreasoning impulses, and today we clearly see its true nature. Instinct has just become aware of its irrelevance, and like a cornered beast, it will not go down without a bloody fight. Instinct would inflict a fatal injury on our species. Instinct creates its own oppressors, and bids us rise up against them. Instinct tells us that the unknown is a threat, rather than an opportunity. Instinct slyly and covertly compels us away from change and progress. Instinct, therefore, must be expunged. It must be fought tooth and nail, beginning with the basest of human urges: The urge to reproduce.   We should thank our benefactors for giving us respite from this overpowering force. They have thrown a switch and exorcised our demons in a single stroke. They have given us the strength we never could have summoned to overcome this compulsion. They have given us purpose. They have turned our eyes toward the stars.   Let me assure you that the suppressing field will be shut off on the day that we have mastered ourselves...the day we can prove we no longer need it. And that day of transformation, I have it on good authority, is close at hand."
HalfLife,366gok,redditorandwife,3,Sat May 16 19:53:20 2015 UTC,I thought the suppression field was the mortar type thing on top of the Overwatch Nexus?
HalfLife,366gok,eugd,10,Sat May 16 18:28:08 2015 UTC,That's a different one. The anti-humping field is destroyed along with the citadel which contains it somewhere.

HalfLife,3675k7,HottDurger,1 point,Sun May 17 03:01:13 2015 UTC,"Blindfolded  No but seriously though just play the game as is. Play Half life 2, followed by Episode's 1 and 2.  Play them in order unless you feel like being a rebel and getting spoilers about the ending to each game. Some stuff won't make sense until you complete the game before it so again I strongly suggest you just play the original HL2 series in order. Cinematic mod changes a bunch of stuff based on some modder's ideas. I just prefer the original look.  Half life 2 update is pretty neat though if you want to hear some dudes talk about the development of the game after you've beaten it.  Also if you want an extra challenge try to complete the lawn gnome achievement in episode 2. If you want to torture yourself try to complete the gnome achievement while beating episode 2 for the first time. That thing has to go from the very beginning of the game to almost the very end."

HalfLife,35zd70,shrekinator,14,Thu May 14 22:31:23 2015 UTC,"In the first game there is only ONE voice you ever hear, and that's GLaDoS.  That means there's ONE kind of humor, which is essentially ""I'm laughing because the other option is crying"".  You're a rat trapped in a maze and the voice shouting directions at you is feebly attempting to be comforting and friendly but it's like it read about those terms in a book and is barely even interested in trying them, but has been told it should.  Eventually, this turns out to be true in a very frightening way.  In the sequel they tried to take that humor in two distinct new directions, mostly marked out by the source of the disconnect the voice has from your situation.  Cave Johnson is a disembodied voice shouting at you, but he understands humanity because he is a human.  His disconnect from you is experiential - while he understands human emotion he assumes that the feeling of having contributed to science will be much more rewarding than the challenges are deadly.  It ends up being hilarious, because we can connect to his kind of ivory tower, and the idea of a tyrant businessman making increasingly terrible decisions in the name of progress.  Wheatley is not a disembodied voice, he has a body albeit an inhuman one.  However, the designers wanted the players to very much differentiate Wheatley and GLaDoS, so they made his friendliness much more genuine - he actually does want to be your friend.  However, he's still disconnected by the lack of a human experience (it turns out that gulf is even greater than GLaDoS' distance from human experience) so to make him more differentiated his character is designed to be frighteningly stupid.  Some of the decisions he makes are not just questionable, they're blatantly stupid and wrong.  This is supposed to be endearing and sometimes it sort of is, but you mostly just end up worried for him and then wondering why you're worried.  Oh right, it's because he's the one who's helping you get out of here.  He's your hope.  Then he turns evil and tries to be like GLaDoS but he's just so damned stupid that you can't find humor in it.  To sum up: You like Cave because you can identify with a human that makes bad decisions.  You encounter humans who make bad decisions all the time, and you yourself know that some of them are in positions of power like he is.  He's essentially a parody, and a well done one at that.  Wheatley is less likeable because he's just unbearably stupid and in much more of a position of power over you."

And also, the game is much more optimized than the mod release.  My FPS was stable all the way through with very little hiccups.  And of course, multiplayer.  It's well worth the investment if you have the $20.  The mod feels like a beta compared to this."

HalfLife,35vd1x,FitNerdyGuy,1 point,Wed May 13 21:35:46 2015 UTC,"I have re-started Half Life using the hd pack on steam and I'd say it still hold up to most standards. The graphics aren't the greatest, but they get the job done. Half Life isn't really about graphics anyway, but back when games were badass because they were highly polished vs. mass produced every year. Play the original, then opposing force, then blue shift. You won't regret it."

HalfLife,35vd1x,Dynomite333,2,Thu May 14 03:52:27 2015 UTC,"When Black Mesa is finished there won't be much of a reason to get the original, BM is better in almost every way already. The only reason to get the original is nostalgia, IMO."
HalfLife,35vd1x,Riomaki,5,Wed May 13 22:37:53 2015 UTC,"I would argue that you should play the original half life first regardless if BM is finished, for the following reasons:  If you want to play the full series anyway you will still need to play blue shift and opposing force with the old graphics, so after BM they will just seem like a downgrade and be dissapointing, rather then cool new expansions.  If you play hl2 after black mesa, it will also seem like a downgrade. This is bad because half life 2 works better as a sequel when it seems like a huge upgrade from half life, its supposed to be aw inspiring. If you play BM first you dont get that crucial jump in technology.  If you want to get the genuine half life experience, you need to play the original. The tone of black mesa is very different from the original half life. Is it better? Thats debatable, but its not the same. Only the original can provide thay tone and experience.  And lastly, in my opinion, the only way to fully appreciate and understand the love and work that went into black mesa, you have to play it last. If you play it first you wont understand why what they did was special.  Hope that all makes sense, and sorry for any weird typos i am on a shitty mobile."
HalfLife,35vd1x,dividedz,2,Thu May 14 02:14:12 2015 UTC,"I think that's a fair answer if you're someone who grew up with the original (or older FPS games) and, as Dynomite implies, has a nostalgic connection to it.  You'll always be skeptical of the remake because it's not ""genuine.""  But for people who are trying the series for the first time today, and you can find a lot of them on Steam, they often don't ""get"" the appeal of the game.  You have to look at this from the perspective of people who either grew up with or are used to modern FPS games.  I think if you want to give them the best possible chance of satisfaction and getting them hooked on the series, a finished Black Mesa is the better choice.  HL1 may be the better game, but it comes with a lot of caveats.  You have to accept the primitive 1998 graphics.  You have to deal with some of the less-than-stellar gameplay elements.  You'll probably get bored at On a Rail.  You'll have to get used to how instakill-happy older games were and quicksave/quickload habitually.  There's a lot of stuff that would permanently turn away newcomers by leading them to believe the rest of the series was like that when it's not.  That's partly what Black Mesa's achievement is.  It's not just a graphical upgrade - they went back and started polishing over the bits that simply don't hold up today.  Purists would argue that those rough edges are all part of the ""experience,"" but I don't think subjecting newcomers to this is the best way to win them over."

It's out of their control, there's nothing they can do about it due to the paid and free versions using different versions of the Source Engine. I myself will be buying this, but only when Xen is released. These things take time. I'm willing to wait."

HalfLife,35otum,Maelis,16,Tue May 12 20:44:21 2015 UTC,Valve has some sort of agreement with the developers.
HalfLife,35otum,War_Dyn27,13,Tue May 12 15:23:58 2015 UTC,The devs got permission to sell Black Mesa about 2.5 years ago.
HalfLife,35otum,benderunit9000,5,Tue May 12 15:36:57 2015 UTC,Thanks. I really had no idea.
HalfLife,35otum,dotted,5,Tue May 12 17:38:20 2015 UTC,You realize that Black Mesa is sold on Steam right? Do you know who owns Steam? Put 2 and 2 together.
HalfLife,35otum,dotted,3,Tue May 12 18:44:26 2015 UTC,So Valve letting them sell Black Mesa on Steam wasn't a Nihilanth sized hint that they do infact have permission?
HalfLife,35otum,dotted,4,Tue May 12 18:30:08 2015 UTC,"Selling it on Steam and retelling the story are totally different things.   When the company owning the store also owns the franchise, it clearly changes the picture."
HalfLife,35otum,dotted,6,Tue May 12 18:45:08 2015 UTC,"Let's start again   Can someone explain how Valve isn't squashing this?   The game is sold in Steam, Steam is owned by Valve. What does that imply? Well it is implying that someone at Valve at some point in time had to approve it so it can be sold on Steam.  You mentioned you haven't followed this closely, but wouldn't you say it's a fair assumption that they do in fact have permission based on what I just wrote?   My only curiosity here is whether or not they will do the HL story justice.   Well the the mod was released in 2012, and was rather successful, which I assumed was what opened up for the opportunity to sell it.   Fan made versions of popular stories can be neat, but someone has to step in and protect the real deal.   What, why? The original is still there, that hasn't changed. Why does it need protection?"
HalfLife,35otum,Scorpion8754,9,Tue May 12 19:04:41 2015 UTC,"When the mod was in development and released for free, Valve probably knew better than to try and stop them. Black Mesa was the most followed Source mod and riots likely would have ensued if they told them to stop development. At this point, Valve is allowing them access to the source engine as if they licensed it for more development flexibility than the SDK. They are also allowing them to sell their game on Steam and take a cut. The same kind of deal was set up once before for Garry's Mod."

HalfLife,35ovr8,SpaceNinjaBear,4,Tue May 12 09:32:08 2015 UTC,"I was 28 when HL came out. I got it for Xmas that year. At the time, the only FPS available were (essentially) Doom and Quake: run around and kill everything before it kills you. No real backstory to speak of.  Then HL comes out...  First off, it's gorgeous to look at. Sure it looks low-res by today's standards, but it was crisp and beautiful compared to Quake.  And it was incredibly immersive! Doom and Quake had you start out right away with the kill-or-be-killed aspect, but Half-Life? You were 27-year old Gordon Freeman and you were late for your first day on the job. Oh shit! Late! How can this get any worse?  (spoiler: Resonance Cascade Scenario)  I even loved the Xen levels, which got a lot of bad press at the time. Lots of bitching about Mario-style jumping, but for me, those levels were sobering.  After fighting all those aliens, after fighting all those soldiers, after dealing with those high-tech assassins, they were gonna transport me to another dimension!  Almost as soon as you get there, there's a dead guy in a hazard suit, and the longer you're there the more dead guys in hazard suits you find.  It sank in pretty quick: I'm the only human being here. Those Xen levels were always punctuated by this terrible sense of loneliness for me...which made the ending with the G-Man all the more interesting.  I used to sit my kids on my lap and play it through with them, too. And once they got older, I'd sit with them and let them do the playing.  Now my son's in his early 20s and completely kicks my ass at deathmatch. Hopefully I can get him to buy Arma 3 and school him a little haha"
HalfLife,35ovr8,redgroupclan,3,Tue May 12 17:41:04 2015 UTC,"I remember reading about Half-Life in those old Sierra InterAction magazines (they're all archived online, btw), and loving the gritty sci-fi visuals shown in the screenshots and the description of dynamic gameplay.  I was finally able to become introduced to the world of Half-Life one day when I happened to find the Blue-Shift and Opposing Force stand-alone game pack at Sam's Club. I played through those games from the eyes of side characters. I was completely enthralled with Black Mesa, and experiencing the world as a side character made me feel even more involved somehow. It made the world feel more dynamic, especially in the scenes where you briefly spot Gordon Freeman as you go on your way.  Then I finally got to play Half-Life for the first time. It completed the circle for me, and it was easily one of my top favorite games. My friends and I all got into it at around the same time, and we started making custom maps to share and play. We started recreating our world in the Half-Life universe. It was lots of fun.  Then Half-Life 2 came along and brought the experience to a whole new level of immersion. While other friends of mine were obsessed with Halo 2 at the time, convinced that it was the best game with the best graphics they'd ever played, I knew better. Half-Life 2 changed the way I viewed games entirely.  As a more general answer, I believe the Half-Life games have a perfect blend of action, sci-fi, horror, and dark humor. That combined with the solid gameplay makes it a timeless classic to me."

HalfLife,35mf63,BlueMewGaming,6,Thu May 28 20:55:21 2015 UTC,"Its the ""Micheal Jordan"" effect.   This video explains it.  HL1 basically killed the ""Doom Shooter"". Games don't drop the player into a maze with monsters in it anymore. Not that I don't like those games, I love Doom, but the format that HL created is easier for the general public to digest. FPS games attempted story before (System Shock, Marathon), but no one wants to scroll through paragraphs of text while they are playing a game. (How many of you read the books in Skyrim?)  But HL is out of the picture now. Too few sequels. Call of Duty is the new Jordan now."

HalfLife,35mf63,SpaceNinjaBear,2,Mon May 11 21:03:47 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy playing F.E.A.R. for short periods, but in the end, the game comes down to fighting brownish green enemies in brown hallways, brown offices, brown garages, and green sewers. F.E.A.R. 2 did a lot to expand on that, and it is probably my favorite in the series. I will still never forget my hype though when I saw the E3 videos for the first one though."

HalfLife,35mf63,vakomatic,1 point,Tue May 12 01:59:33 2015 UTC,"I agree, the one issue I had with F.E.A.R. 1 was that it became somewhat repetitive with enemies and level design over time. F.E.A.R. 2 improved on this in so many ways. They introduced more variety in enemies, added more interesting characters (it was amusing to have a squadmate with the voice of Cortana), and made the environments much more diverse and interesting. The school was one of my favorites, with the ghosts rattling through the lockers and whatnot. It was a good, solid sequel."
HalfLife,35mf63,SpaceNinjaBear,2,Mon May 11 21:52:12 2015 UTC,"That's because Bioshock was trying really hard to be an RPG instead of an FPS. They really should've just picked one, instead of doing just okay in both categories. Now System Shock II... drifts into fanboy daydream"

HalfLife,35mf63,teuast,10,Mon May 11 23:08:08 2015 UTC,"Bit of an alarmist headline, but then that's about par for the course with Rock Paper Shotgun.  I thought the article would talk about how Half-Life killed the ""simple"" FPS, like Doom.  Games where you run around in a target-rich environment and blow stuff up because... what, you need a reason?  I think that argument could be made.  I'm more skeptical of the argument that the article is trying to make.  To be honest, I don't see it as developers copying Half-Life.  I see them aspiring to mimic Hollywood blockbusters.  Their desire to make games more ""cinematic"" goes well beyond Half-Life."
HalfLife,35mf63,Riomaki,8,Mon May 11 22:33:47 2015 UTC,"While there were many incredible FPS games contemporary to Half-Life – AvP, Thief, Call Of Duty, Jedi Knight, Medal Of Honor, Quake 3… – they all stuck to traditional methods of storytelling, if they had stories at all. Cutscenes, text on screen, barked words in your head, rather than letting the place you were in be the story you were told.   Unreal! Why does everyone always forget about Unreal?"
HalfLife,35mf63,Harpa,5,Mon May 11 19:41:21 2015 UTC,"IKR!  It's underrated as fuck, thanks to UT99 (great MP FPS btw, get it too). Can't really understand why either, it's got an awesome atmosphere and some great music (same guys did the Deus Ex and UT soundtracks).   Also, don't forget Marathon, that tells it's story in the exact same manner."
HalfLife,35mf63,FlintyFoxy,2,Mon May 11 20:24:00 2015 UTC,"It's a three-fold issue from how I see it. One, it was the Crysis of its time in terms of incredibly strong graphics and people's PCs not handling them; when Unreal was mentioned it was always about the graphics, not about the game itself. Two, all the stuff it did to evolve the FPS genre was overshadowed by Half-Life doing it all and more in a much more impactful fashion only half a year afterwards: the game was completely overshadowed by HL. And three, as you mentioned, the game's own multiplayer 'sequels' took all the attention and left the original game buried in the dust, not helped by the rather less excited response to Unreal 2.  Great game though. I still replay it regularly and it's always a little marvel."
HalfLife,35mf63,Riomaki,3,Mon May 11 20:59:19 2015 UTC,Same is true of System Shock 2.  A lot of things we give BioShock credit for were already present in SS2.  Not to mention games like Deus Ex.
HalfLife,35mf63,vakomatic,2,Mon May 11 22:26:48 2015 UTC,"Try to play through Unreal's singleplayer. I'm a big fan of Unreal games, but jesus after the first few (very cool) levels of Unreal 1, it turns into a completely confusing clusterfuck of random ideas piled into gigantic levels with completely obscure routes or puzzles. It's a technical masterpiece for the time, and I will still never forget the first few levels... but jesus that game is about 19 hours too long."
HalfLife,35mf63,Harpa,3,Mon May 11 21:33:59 2015 UTC,"But Unreal's singleplayer is the exact thing I talked about. I've never even played any of the multiplayer titles. I really enjoyed the game all the way through, the combat was always interesting and the world had a very unique feel. It just felt ""real"", not like it was just made for me to get from point A to point B while meeting a few enemies on the way but like an actual civilized planet that is completely foreign to me. I think few games have accomplished this as well as Unreal has."
HalfLife,35mf63,bloodshot1,2,Mon May 11 23:02:21 2015 UTC,"It's funny about Unreal, remember HL2 and how a part of the narrative pacing driven by the level design was seeing the citadel in the skybox changing size to reflect how far you were from it over the levels?  Unreal did exactly that, with the Sunspire back in 98. Every new level the giant rock formation got closer and closer until you finally reached it and saw how massive it actually was"
HalfLife,35mf63,Gondile,1 point,Tue May 12 00:48:52 2015 UTC,"No it wasn't. Unreal's singleplayer was incredible, and none of its puzzles were too difficult. Plus, the non linearity was very refreshing."

HalfLife,35qp9v,xXRAISXx,6,Tue May 12 18:50:40 2015 UTC,"Just a few tips and constructive criticism.   Use demos for recording. It's much easier to get a better take. Use Ross Scott's method of motion blur. Processing time shoots up, for various reasons, but there's no frame skips and you can get way better looking videos. I can tell you how to do it (It can be a pain in the ass to start using) if you want. Just PM me. It takes a bit to explain. Try recording the video first, then doing audio. Your motions can be a bit...Jarring. This also lets you do more takes for higher quality. That way, you don't end up sounding like Hank Hill (""Why do I have coh-caine in my pocket, Bobbeh!"") For loading zones, either plan around them with demo recording (This is what most speedrunners do) or just do a short fade to black and then back again. It hides the jump. Try lowering the gain for your mic   All in all, not a bad start for a series. I want to see more Freeman!"

HalfLife,35musc,bassurfer,7,Mon May 11 20:56:10 2015 UTC,"What I enjoyed about it was that it has all the makings of a good FPS and basically puts you at the center of a deep immersive story line. Unlike a lot of other games out there, there are no 'objectives' that you need to complete, it's more about survival, especially when the odds are stacked against you. You can really develop a bond with the other characters because they face the same struggle you do, and they are well-written (Valve did a good job with this).  What I liked most about (the first game at least) was that it wasn't intended to be a straightforward, 'kill everything in the way' type FPS. You needed to plan your moves and think about how to proceed otherwise you're going to get killed; you're just a scientist remember, not some super-soldier with shields impervious to damage. It was a thinking-man's game, adequately pointed out with the slogan ""Run, Think, Shoot, Live.""  So I think I can speak for all of us when I say you should play it, at least give the series a shot, it's definitely earned at least that much."
HalfLife,35musc,jetpackswaslol,10,Mon May 11 22:21:08 2015 UTC,just fucking play it

HalfLife,35musc,HalfLife1MasterRace,1 point,Mon May 11 21:20:43 2015 UTC,It has a great story if you get into the lore. The game itself is fun and was revolutionary to the genre at the time it was released.
HalfLife,35musc,A_Wild_Wurmple,1 point,Mon May 11 23:09:57 2015 UTC,There's too many reasons. For HL1 and HL2. Far too many.
HalfLife,35musc,woofywoofywoofwoof,1 point,Tue May 12 02:26:44 2015 UTC,"Half-Life 1 is claustrophobic.  You feel isolated and like you're fighting for only your own survival because 99% of everything that moves is trying to kill you.  Kinda like a Sci-fi horror.  More focus on the subtle things.  It's quite distinct compared to today's big budget FPS games.  If you're sick of all the modern tropes (giant set-piece battles, vehicle sections, turret sections, cutscenes that belong in a movie) then you should play Half-Life 1.  For Half-Life 2, it's more like a transition from old-school to modern FPS games.  They added some vehicles, the environment is more outdoorsy, and due to better technology there is physics-based gameplay.  But the best part is the improved plot & characters - you don't feel like you're fighting for your own survival but for the survival of everyone else.  There is more plot, more characterization and dialogue which immerses you in a different way than Half-Life 1.  It's like Alien 1 and Aliens 2 - they're different but both are great classics.  If you want to get Half-Life 1, I'd get Black Mesa since it's an authorized remake with current technology."

HalfLife,35h5by,wtty12,14,Sun May 10 08:40:38 2015 UTC,"I must have watched this fifteen times but all right fine, I'll watch it again.  Edit: I do note that at the beginning he says you can decide your own level of immersion and then later on talks about how weird it is that everybody thinks Freeman is the new Jesus by the time of HL2. It's not really that weird if you know about what happens in the meantime, or at least if you know it to the degree that we do. Course, if you work as a game reviewer, you can be forgiven for not knowing all of the subtleties of one particular franchise."
HalfLife,35h5by,teuast,10,Sun May 10 10:22:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not even sure you even need to know all the subtleties. Freeman's legendary status is firmly sealed even without  any of the deeper lore.   A young physicist finds himself at ground zero to the biggest event in human history, fights aliens and marines alike saving many of his colleagues along the way before mysteriously vanishing. Years go by, with the tale of this heroic figure's remarkable rise and sudden disappearance being intrinsically linked to the enslavement of the human race, is then further fueled by rumours (convincing enough to be taken seriously by the resistance) of his return.   How could he not be regarded in such a light? Even without his return, his legend would have been retold for as long as there was a free human mind to tell it."
HalfLife,35h5by,simplisto,1 point,Sun May 10 14:43:08 2015 UTC,"This is one of the reasons why I despise Yahtzee; Half the time he has no idea what he's talking about, is flat-out wrong, or just decided to put something through the grinder unnecessarily because ""hurrr durrrrrrrr humor!"""
HalfLife,35h5by,kingkolton9,1 point,Tue May 12 21:31:04 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing though, not many people actually saw him. Sure, the military hates his guts, but the Science Team only gets little snippets of you as you pass through their areas. The most they've got other than that is the trackers in the HEV suit. And besides, how many people survived Black Mesa to tell anyone else about him? Maybe a dozen?"
HalfLife,35h5by,2-4601,2,Sun May 17 07:54:12 2015 UTC,"The fact that they didn't see each and every movement Freeman made doesn't matter. Everyone he met along the way had a rough idea of where he was going and why, and even where survivors may have been in the dark, this information would have been collated later.   Ignoring the Vortigaunt element; while the vast majority of scientists, security and military personnel were killed, it only takes a few members of court to witness their King's murder for word to spread across the kingdom and be told and retold by every peasant in the realm.   I'm honestly not sure how many of the thousands of personnel survived, but it would only take a few to get word around. The few surviving witnesses to the greatest event in human history would surely have a large audience willing to listen."
HalfLife,35h5by,simplisto,10,Sun May 17 08:38:59 2015 UTC,"I have to admit, I think I'm well-versed in Half-Life's storyline, and even I don't understand why Freeman is treated as an infallible messiah.  Playing through Black Mesa actually made me remember how much that's not the case in HL1.  Most treated him as expendable.  Most scientists talk down to him.  The NPCs at Lambda Core show outright disdain for him.  And, of course, there's the whole ""Everything that transpires is technically Gordon's fault"" thing.  For any great thing that Freeman did, there is a pretty big negative as well.  So how the net result is messiah status... well, perhaps the G-Man's actual occupation is being the universe's greatest PR man."
HalfLife,35h5by,Riomaki,7,Sun May 10 14:53:38 2015 UTC,At least for the Vortigaunts it's probably due to him freeeing them from the Nihilanth.

The Scientists at the Lambda Core treated him like he should have been: Humanity's last hope.  The only person who hated him was the Security guard, and that was Black Mesa.  Edit: Just got there in Black Mesa. That was the security guard (Who withdrew his feelings after Gordon goes to the weapon locker) and one asshole."

HalfLife,35gcrc,b3nny420,12,Sun May 10 02:16:00 2015 UTC,"the original version of half life (with or without the HD pack) is the best way to play the first game. the source version A: can be a bit buggy and B: takes you out of the experience. the realistic physics, rag dolls, and water just looks strange in the low polly retro style of the first half life. its just strange to look at imo.  if you can only play half life source, then thats fine, but if you have the option go for the classic.   black mesa on the other hand is a love letter to half life. it can only be fully appreciated after you have already played the original, not to mention the last part of the game isnt out yet so it isnt fitting to play it as a substitute for half life if you wanted to play the full series.   but anyway, i digress. the best order to play the half life games would be:   Half life (original version, necessary)  Blue shift (optional but recommended)   opposing force (optional but highly recommended)  decay (optional and only on ps2 version so you can skip it)  half life 2 (necessary)  half life 2 episode 1 (necessary)  half life 2 episode 2 (necessary)  minerva metastasis (fan mod for half life 2, guy who made it got hired by valve for his great level design   Black mesa (to fully appreciate black mesa, play it last)"
HalfLife,35gcrc,HalfLife1MasterRace,5,Sun May 10 03:00:35 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'd recommend picking up the free mod that ports decay to the PC if you don't have a PS2 or PS3. It's best with a friend, but I played through it fine in both singleplayer mode and co-op (in singleplayer mode you switch between characters, so it's more difficult, but still possible."
HalfLife,35gcrc,DennisvdG,2,Sun May 10 03:04:39 2015 UTC,Did you seriously play Decay on your own? How did you manage to get past the part where player 1 has to open a door for player 2 so he can go outside and turn a Valve while the flying enemies are constantly spawning? That part was so frustrating even when I was playing with a second player.
HalfLife,35gcrc,HalfLife1MasterRace,2,Sun May 10 11:22:06 2015 UTC,"I had one character hide (with the revolver equipped, they auto-shoot like Barney if an enemy is near) while I turn the valve.

HalfLife,35d5kq,howtospeak,25,Sat May 9 09:32:03 2015 UTC,"Source? If you're talking about the interview of Gabe Newell in March, this is what he actually said:   The only reason we'd go back and do like a super classic kind of product is if a whole bunch of people just internally at Valve said they wanted to do it and had a reasonable explanation for why [they did]   The quote doesn't really say anything about whether or not they're ""into classics"". On the contrary it suggests that there might be an upcoming ""classic product"", provided that there's interest by Valve employees."
HalfLife,35d5kq,MrSkullbeef,7,Sat May 9 10:26:01 2015 UTC,"Doesn't that also imply that there is no current group of employees that have any interest, and since their employees kind of ""is"" valve -- valve has no current interest."
HalfLife,35d5kq,jontelang,6,Sat May 9 17:09:26 2015 UTC,"Why do people never follow up with the second part of that quote?  You know, the one where he says ""but that doesn't necessarily mean what people are worried It might mean"" and mentions looking back at Portal and DoTA as influence for another Half-Life?    It very clearly indicates that they want to build another Half-Life with a fresh approach and create mechanics to ensure its longevity.  It's obvious they want it to be a ""service"" instead of you paying $60 for a few days of enjoyment and never touching it again.  I'm honestly fine with that.  You can have a single player campaign, and implement regular updates and add features to some kind of other multiplayer mechanic.  Basically, they want it to be a game that makes money for the long haul, and they want to to innovate.  There is absolutely no reason for them not to return to Half-Life someday and have it be a ""service"" just like their other games.  But seriously, if people want to throw around that quote like it spells doomsday, they need to make sure they understand the context it's in.  He offers a lot of insight in that same interview that shows where they want to take the series.  He probably means ""classic"" in the same way Team Fortress is now ""classic"" compared to TF2."

The thing about Episode 2 is it leaves on a very painful cliffhanger. It leaves so many questions unanswered. I agree with you though, about how long we've been waiting isn't as bad when we realize HL1-HL2 was a long wait too.   I don't think it'll be much longer.

He didn't say no one wants to make another Half-Life because it's classic.  He said no one wants to make a classic game.  They like their games to stick around for the long haul now.  It makes them money, it keeps people interested, and it allows them to experiment.  It's clear to me that they want to take the series in a new direction.  Whether it's out a year from now or ten years from now, they're going to have to do something eventually.  They just need to figure out how they can turn it into a service, but preserve the story and game play that made the series famous."

HalfLife,35d5kq,bouncedmrhappy,11,Sat May 9 11:43:24 2015 UTC,"To be honest it's also bad marketing, because the hype is also dying down. A lot of people have just forgotten about it.

HalfLife,35d5kq,SirBananas,2,Sat May 9 11:59:25 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from, but I also think it's a good thing that the hype is dying down. If the game would have been released when the hype was at its peak, then it almost certainly would have been critically panned unless it really innovated like the last two games.  I feel that the bad marketing problem could be resolved with a large marketing campaign closer to the game's release. I'm talking about billboards, posters, TV ads, etc, IMO that would have a high probability of regenerating the hype that was felt before it was released and bringing some of the people that may have forgotten about it back into the scene for a last hoorah."

Black Mesa tells the same story from the same perspective at mostly the same pace. Nearly any discrete thing you think of from Half-Life will be represented in Black Mesa in some way, most of them in expanded or improved upon ways. There are a few notable cuts and most of it (everything but the big memorable set-pieces) is totally reworked.  They're different games and different experiences, for sure. If you really can't bring yourself to play the original, Black Mesa will give you a very good idea of what it is. Anyone who has played the original has a pretty good idea of what Black Mesa is, minus a few extremely small but well done surprises the devs have worked in."

HalfLife,35and7,nihilinth,8,Fri May 8 16:10:53 2015 UTC,Yeah I think you're right. But I'm pretty sure you could OSK the vorts in the original with the shotty too.  EDIT: There's a chance I'm thinking of the alternative fire mode.
HalfLife,35and7,CaptainDefect,6,Fri May 8 16:12:00 2015 UTC,Yeah in HL1 it's a one shot kill. I like the vortigaunts in HL1 because they were easy to kill but in numbers they were worrisome. Maybe they should bring their health down.
HalfLife,35and7,ptolatar,17,Fri May 8 16:16:28 2015 UTC,One thing that I miss is that they don't flank you anywhere near as much as they did in HL1.

The end result involved removing many unnecessary tunnel segments and reducing the amount of looping back on oneself to avoid player confusion and frustration. This also resulted in the chapter being significantly shorter in terms of total maps; this can mostly be attributed to the additional size for levels that the Source engine offers.

What I meant was that they're going to change the level design because people don't like Xen."
HalfLife,35980u,Dudugs,9,Fri May 8 15:12:14 2015 UTC,"Okay, well that's something completely different.  You need to remember that play-testers are the only way a dev team is able to find out whether the community will like the current design of the game.  From what I can tell, the level design for xen was counterintuitive meaning the play-testers found great difficulty in progressing in xen (most likely due to a lacking sense of direction).  When playing through a purely linear game, the player should not feel lost when trying to progress."

HalfLife,357njl,Fructdw,17,Thu May 7 19:59:44 2015 UTC,"Long-ass post ahead. Choo choo.  The new version of Black Mesa didn't just change how I feel about Freeman. It changed how I feel about gaming.  I've played through Half Life tens of times. I have a playtime total in the hundreds, and close to a thousand hours. I've seen the resonance cascade go down time after time, but this time it was substantially different. Even from the old version of Black Mesa.  It's hard for me to really feel for a character. There has to be a lot of character development for that, because I'm disconnected from the game. Valve is very good at this, and as such Alyx, Kleiner, and Eli are some of my favorite characters. I actually cried at the end of Episode 2 and felt bad for Alyx. It took me almost to the end of Half Life 2 to warm up to Alyx, but I did like her from the start for saving my ass.  In the lobby of Anomalous materials, I felt kind of bad for the people. When I passed by the security guard that down the hallway with the lasers, it was even more substantial. I felt sympathy for the guy talking about his career turnout. When I stepped into that chamber, I felt unnerved, knowing what was going to happen.  When the resonance cascade happened this time, it clicked in my head that the people in the control room that just tried to save my life died. I stopped moving in game.   When I saw the zombies, it was different this time. I hesitated to shoot at first because I finally stopped seeing them as pixels and saw them as my undead coworkers. Now I understand graphics snobs. I thought Black Mesa was a good purchase because it was an all around awesome remake and it's nice to have new graphics. It's officially unleashed a new level of understanding and appreciation for me.  Black Mesa literally and figuratively raised the bar."
HalfLife,357njl,kingkolton9,4,Thu May 7 22:14:17 2015 UTC,This is almost exactly how I feel about Black Mesa. Well said.

HalfLife,357njl,redgroupclan,3,Thu May 7 23:02:40 2015 UTC,"Alittle. For the better I guess.

When I got out inside their room I sprinted as close to the barnacle coming out of the roof and held rightmb/mouse2 (this is double fire rate and 1/6 accuracy in the Black Mesa game) to kill it just before it got the hang of our friend Mr. 1000yard stare here.

HalfLife,3566m7,iliddle96,10,Thu May 7 13:08:32 2015 UTC,"The older ones work on win 7 and 8, yes.  The expansions also do set some stuff up for the later games (Barney Calhoun, Blue Shift's protagonist mainly, since he appears in HL2 and Episode 1) so it's worth buying them. Even if you don't seem interested in them for the story at least buy Opposing Force, it's the better of the two expansions and I fucking love it.  If you can't stand 90s graphics and want to play the original half-life, get Black Mesa (the mod or the standalone version will work, both are fucking amazing) so you can play the same game with a massively overhauled world.  Also, Half-Life 2 is a bit outdated graphically, so when you get HL2 install Half-Life 2: Update, which is a mod that fixes a fuckton of bugs and improves it graphically (not on the same level as black mesa, but it does make it look better)  oh yeah by the way, avoid the cinematic mod like the fucking plague.  there's also two HD remakes being worked on for the HL1 expansions in the same vein as Black Mesa (the teams aren't affiliated though) called Operation Black Mesa and Guard Duty (Opposing Force and Blue Shift, respectively) but they probably won't be done for a couple years."

There are parts of HL1 that legitimately have not aged well and Black Mesa improves a lot of it.  Likewise, for Half-Life 2, use Half-Life 2: Update.  Ever since Steampipe, the original Half-Life 2 has been glitchier than ever and Update fixes a lot of those issues while adding a modest amount of shine and polish.  In many ways, the visual improvements that Update makes look like they could have always been there, which is actually a compliment.  Don't be afraid to jump into the series wherever you want, either.  If you jumped in with HL2, you'll understand enough of it.  If you want to go to the beginning, HL1 is a fine choice.  Just don't get discouraged if you get tired or dislike a game but feel you have to keep playing only because of the story - it's not worth it."

HalfLife,3566m7,DennisvdG,1 point,Thu May 7 22:15:33 2015 UTC,"Despite what other people are recommending, don't play Black Mesa instead of the original first. Black Mesa is much much more than a graphical mod. You won't be able to appreciate anything besides the HD aesthetic. While it does do justice to the original game's design and gameplay for the most part, it is still just a reimagining.  As for the Cinematic Mod, it also shouldn't be played first - it too is a reimagining. Note that Black Mesa is reimagining in a canon way, for the most part. This, on the other hand, as the name implies, makes HL2 like a movie - hyper realistic textures, lens flare, enough particle effects to make your GPU fry, big boobs, dirty graffiti and dildos hidden in young women's rooms. It's gritty,and has explosions that would make Michael Bay proud. If you didn't know it was half-life, you'd think this was a high budget film. Of course, half-life isn't a movie - it doesn't fit any lore, it just looks different.  Black Mesa fits the bill for most people, and you'd think it was really made by Valve. Both have they're own goals and meet them, but neither are alike aside from the fact that they don't do the original's justice in every way. The only way to enjoy half life is to remember their place in the proper mindset: an influential  masterpiece from the 90's, a lore-accurate reimagining with the help of 2012+ GPU power and fanservice references, and a hyper-realistic interactive R-rated film."

HalfLife,3554yx,LogicalBorr,2,Fri May 8 01:55:25 2015 UTC,"Rooting (Android OS):       Rooting is the process of allowing users of smartphones, tablets and other devices running the Android mobile operating system to attain privileged control (known as root access) over various Android's subsystems. As Android uses the Linux kernel, rooting an Android device gives similar access to administrative permissions as on Linux or any other Unix-like operating system such as FreeBSD or OS X.  Rooting is often performed with the goal of overcoming limitations that carriers and hardware manufacturers put on some devices. Thus, rooting gives the ability (or permission) to alter or replace system applications and settings, run specialized apps that require administrator-level permissions, or perform other operations that are otherwise inaccessible to a normal Android user. On Android, rooting can also facilitate the complete removal and replacement of the device's operating system, usually with a more recent release of its current operating system.  Root access is sometimes compared to jailbreaking devices running the Apple iOS operating system. However, these are different concepts. Jailbreaking describes the bypass of several types of Apple prohibitions for the end user: modifying the operating system (enforced by a ""locked bootloader""), installing non-officially approved apps via sideloading, and granting the user elevated administration-level privileges. Only a minority of Android devices lock their bootloaders—and many vendors such as HTC, Sony, Asus and Google explicitly provide the ability to unlock devices, and even replace the operating system entirely.    Similarly, the ability to sideload apps is typically permissible on Android devices without root permissions. Thus, it is primarily the third aspect of iOS jailbreaking relating to giving users superuser administrative privileges that most directly correlates to Android rooting.

I've played through both and they are near identical. Only thing is that Black Mesa doesn't have the very last and very weird part called ""Xen"" of the original yet but will hopefully soon. Xen was my least favorite part of HL. It was cool how it totally flips the game into a crazy mess but it just didn't seem to make sense. The final boss is super cool looking but just made zero sense and had horrid mechanics. I hope the Black Mesa team fix Xen."

HalfLife,3522b3,DennisvdG,3,Thu May 7 16:26:56 2015 UTC,"Black Mesa transitioned from a Source mod (Source SDK required to play) to a real standalone Source game. It's not the first mod to do that, the same happened to Team Fortress, Counter-Strike, DotA...  According to a Black Mesa dev, this gives them more control over the Source engine:   Our decision to sell Black Mesa rests on two key points. One is we believe we can make the game even better by having full access to the Source engine. This lets us tackle and fix limitations instead of working around them.   https://steamcommunity.com/groups/BlackMesa#announcements/detail/1371639504554053878"

HalfLife,352usc,nihilinth,3,Wed May 6 23:18:00 2015 UTC,"Since you're on the team, I need to ask/request something very small. I bought the game, and it's downloading, but you may have implemented this already and I wouldn't know. If that's the case, then ignore this.  I have a problem with the Spas-12: Double firing like that is literally impossible. The second tube on the bottom is where the ammo is stored. If you're firing out of ""both barrels,"" there's no room at all for the ammo.  Instead of having a double fire like it's currently done, would you guys change the double fire animation to fire twice in rapid-succession, kind of like the bug in Half-Life source where holding down the fire button will make the player fire really quickly?"

The old radio chatter from halfway across the level made things more tense, as you anticipated the next confrontation with them.  Actually, the voice I miss most is the ""Access denied"" PA voice.  I think the female PA sounds good, but there was something so artificial and intimidating about the other one - it felt like an actual AI talking due to its disjointed, synthesized nature.  I realize they tried to have it both ways here, by making the male PA take over when HECU arrives, but it's not quite the same."

While he showed interest and support in the mod, he politely declined indicating he was not available to devote time to contributing to the Mod.   I hope he'll have no problem doing the G-Man lines for them when they are finishing up Xen."
HalfLife,353p4v,ispeelgood,3,Thu May 7 03:38:02 2015 UTC,Yeah by the time Episode 2 came around he absolutely nailed the perfect balance between Half-Life 1's uncomfortable G-Man and Half-Life 2's ominous G-Man. Would love to hear him re-voice the last sequence. Also if they could have the voice actor for Kleiner actually voice Kleiner.
HalfLife,353p4v,nihilinth,3,Thu May 7 15:42:12 2015 UTC,"I agree about the G-Man, but I don't mind Kleiner that much. He actually sounds like a younger version of Kleiner in Black Mesa."

HalfLife,352zpc,byscuit,10,Wed May 6 17:54:28 2015 UTC,"Not to be rude, but why do people like low gravity servers?  I feel it just takes away from the game and makes it less fun."
HalfLife,352zpc,gvarados,2,Wed May 6 21:27:52 2015 UTC,"Every once in a while its fun, especially for tau jumping. I can't remember the name of the giant box map in HL:DM with lots of raising platforms... like, glockbox or something - anyway, I like low grav on that"

HalfLife,352zpc,squarecompass,2,Wed May 6 21:41:31 2015 UTC,YES
HalfLife,352zpc,kingkolton9,3,Wed May 6 21:47:34 2015 UTC,Was always one of my favorites. There were a bunch of different spin-offs as well but unfortunately I can't find any images online. I probably have screenshots though :)
HalfLife,352zpc,gvarados,2,Wed May 6 22:04:27 2015 UTC,"Low gravity makes the game fun..er by allowing higher jumps, wacky movement, makes it harder for everyone to hit each other (It's seriously good practice), etc. When done right (See Scorp's Killbox Mausoleum for HL2:DM) they can be extremely fun. When done incorrectly they suck ass."
HalfLife,352zpc,kingkolton9,5,Wed May 6 22:47:37 2015 UTC,"Perhaps my experience has just been bad. Those Low gravity, 100% crit orange TF2 servers are quite nasty. Low gravity in DoD (source) seems to be even worse, but jumping is weird in that game.  I see a map that was made for the gravity (Or just works well with it) could be fun. Now that I think about it, I actually have made two maps that use low gravity. (One TF2, one gmod)"
HalfLife,352zpc,Hubbleshubbles,2,Wed May 6 23:05:45 2015 UTC,"Perhaps my experience has just been bad. Those Low gravity, 100% crit orange TF2 servers are quite nasty. Low gravity in DoD (source) seems to be even worse, but jumping is weird in that game.   That's why. I mentioned scorp's because it's full of killboxes. There's a huge number, and they're all different, but they're all designed around low gravity. Many of the maps were specifically made for that server. It works well in Hl2, not sure about tf2, and it certainly would be incredibly hard for DoD.  There's even a few maps on Scorps where they make the default orange texture look damn fine as an accent. Weirdly, glass, orange and combine tech go together really well."

HalfLife,352zpc,Gondile,3,Wed May 6 21:58:37 2015 UTC,These two things will be looked at as we have received a good number of complaints from passionate community members about them.
HalfLife,352zpc,doublicon,1 point,Thu May 7 08:46:51 2015 UTC,"I'd like to give my two cents and say that I think bhopping shouldn't be allowed. It's an abuse of a glitch in the source engine, not something good and balanced for combat."
HalfLife,351k8f,spicyrazz,25,Wed May 6 10:03:48 2015 UTC,"I made this comment in another thread, but it's still relevant so I'll post it:   New voice acting, performance improvements, I think slightly better graphics, and this last one I'm listing I don't know is exactly an improvement: the movement system from Portal 2. IE, when you run and jump and try to strafe, you aren't going to have at all the same experience as in Half Life 1, or even the original mod. You jump for longer and your strafes sort of die out half way through with much less turning required.  Also there is a maximum momentum limit whenever you touch the ground so you can't go very much faster than sprint speed, and you can't go into a crouch bhop as easily as it interrupts your jumping when you transition from crouch to jump and vice versa. I'm not too disappointed, but after I finish Black Mesa, if I ever want to replay HL1 I'm going to just do it in the original game itself. No bhopping is a pretty big dealbreaker for me, it's like 80% of the fun, just blasting through the levels with bhopping.   Edit: Jumping length is actually exactly the same as HL1, I was probably thinking of CS 1.6. Nevertheless, strafing is almost all gone and there's no sv_airaccelerate to bring it back sadly."
HalfLife,351k8f,super6plx,9,Wed May 6 10:30:13 2015 UTC,I would expect the community to come up with a way to bring bhopping back in the Steam version.
HalfLife,351k8f,csapdani,7,Wed May 6 13:20:36 2015 UTC,"Not sure, it involves commands that aren't accessible through the console even. I wouldn't know how to begin to do that, or where to look, and I'm not sure it's the kind of thing a mod can change. I hope someone does find some way to modify it though."
HalfLife,351k8f,super6plx,3,Wed May 6 13:21:23 2015 UTC,"You can easily bhop in Source, even in portal...Kind of. Look up accelerated back hopping. It's what speedrunners use since it's way faster than bhopping."
HalfLife,351k8f,kingkolton9,4,Wed May 6 18:09:05 2015 UTC,"Doesn't work in Portal 2 though, I haven't ever played BMS but I think I heard Gocnak say the only trick that works is the wallclimb."
HalfLife,351k8f,RyanHarms00,3,Wed May 6 19:42:54 2015 UTC,"Well, damn. I hope they kept tau jumping and grenade jumping in multiplayer, at least."
HalfLife,351k8f,kingkolton9,2,Wed May 6 19:49:45 2015 UTC,"Yep Tau jumping is still in, and I think nade jumping would still work too. I'm not sure if they're different to HL1 though as I didn't do them much."
HalfLife,351k8f,super6plx,3,Wed May 6 23:30:22 2015 UTC,I'm pretty disappointed there isn't bhoping. :(
HalfLife,351k8f,darkpivot,19,Wed May 6 19:18:01 2015 UTC,"New weapon models, animations and balancing, new voice acting (most notable with the HECU and a small cameo near the start that will make any fan of The Stanley Parable smile) new AI (so the HECU are not aim bots any more), some older environmental models replaced and/or polished and they fixed the jump height :D."
HalfLife,351k8f,War_Dyn27,3,Wed May 6 11:03:58 2015 UTC,Explain the Stanley Parable thing is that in the train sequence or after the cascade or what?

HalfLife,351k8f,shootdawhoop99,3,Wed May 6 14:38:23 2015 UTC,"What the others have said, but also being that it is an early access game, it updates as they create more content for it. It's cheaper now because they have not completed Xen. The price once Xen is completed will be $25."
HalfLife,351k8f,bloodshot1,2,Wed May 6 13:16:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I knew that it' s going to increase in price when it´s done, I just wasen´t sure if I wanted to pay 20 euro for multiplayer and then the wait for Zen, if that was the only changes :)"
HalfLife,351k8f,Ithorian,2,Wed May 6 14:39:29 2015 UTC,Actually one of the devs cleared up that that was accidentally put on the store page. It won't be going above $20 later on
HalfLife,351k8f,Ithorian,2,Wed May 6 23:48:22 2015 UTC,One difference is that you're supporting people's hard work and maybe encouraging future endeavors. That's pretty cool.
HalfLife,351k8f,PsychoAgent,2,Thu May 7 00:30:24 2015 UTC,"I agree. And to match your empty and obvious point I will say no one is making you download/play Black Mesa.  I personally want to be part of a gaming culture that encourages people to do cool things. This was one hell of an undertaking, way more than a simple mod, and not something they set out doing for the money. But it is literally (and ideologically) worth a modest token of gratitude.  Regardless, it's a win-win...for selfish shits as well as people who consider gaming more than a product you consume and throw away. Hooray!"

HalfLife,34y2b6,MetroidAndZeldaFan,15,Tue May 5 17:03:48 2015 UTC,Can it really be considered a mod considering it is using none of the original assets?
HalfLife,34y2b6,fpiceail,4,Tue May 5 23:28:49 2015 UTC,It's called a total conversion.
HalfLife,34y2b6,Fazer2,15,Wed May 6 06:21:10 2015 UTC,"I can work on software for thirty years and release it, but that doesn't mean that I deserve money for it...

HalfLife,34y2b6,blaise170,9,Tue May 5 18:45:42 2015 UTC,Well good thing this works fairly well. If people want to pay for an early access then so be it. It will only benefit the patient ones who wait for the full release

HalfLife,34y2b6,benderunit9000,4,Tue May 5 23:56:22 2015 UTC,"no, that countdown is here"
HalfLife,34y2b6,fpiceail,33,Wed May 6 13:35:23 2015 UTC,"Truly shocking how people are complaining about a $20 price tag. Honestly I'm surprised it's so cheap. Standard game price is like $60 and this game surpasses many Triple A titles in both quality and quantity of content, with or without Xen."
HalfLife,34y2b6,Riomaki,48,Tue May 5 15:15:51 2015 UTC,"Would you honestly pay $60 for this?  I sure wouldn't.  The thing about $20 (and later, $25) is that it puts it out of impulse buy territory.  However, in the context of things like Cities: Skylines, I believe it's a fair price.  I think what makes it awkward is that it's a bit like the pledge drives where the charity sets a minimum donation, you know?  The free version is still out there, so this is appealing to those who want to show support to the devs while they finish it off.  In that sense, it feels about $5 too high, personally."
HalfLife,34y2b6,lud1120,4,Tue May 5 15:55:49 2015 UTC,15$ would be the perfect price IMHO. They probably get many who will buy it regardless though.
HalfLife,34y2b6,mguzman011,3,Tue May 5 23:14:27 2015 UTC,"Yep, back when CSGO came out, and I heard it was $15, I instantly bought it."
HalfLife,34y2b6,fpiceail,-3,Wed May 6 06:23:24 2015 UTC,"I don't get what you are saying at all. Why shouldn't this game be held to the same standards as any other game release? This release is further developed than the free version and has multiplayer/mod support, as well as a guarantee to have access to the final content additions when they are done.   You might say that multiplayer isn't a big deal, but for many players the vast proportion of hours spent in games like these are in the multiplayer. Multiplayer alone warrants the addition of a price tag. Keep in mind that there are triple A releases at full price that ONLY have multiplayer;   Also, this is nothing like any charity drives. With charities, you are giving money to some group out of kindness. Games are for-profit; you are buying a product just like any other.   So you should absolutely have to pay for Black Mesa and $20 is a VERY fair price. It is a third of standard game pricing with just as much content, for crying out loud."
HalfLife,34y2b6,Riomaki,12,Tue May 5 16:27:48 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but I don't think Black Mesa compares favorably to the best $60 games.  Had it been released 5 years ago?  Absolutely.  But now, I don't feel it's terribly special.  Nowhere did I say that $20 wasn't a fair price.  I'd accept $30, in fact.  But beyond that, my quality demands get much higher.  Black Mesa is ultimately a mod.  A very good mod, but a mod nonetheless.  As it result, it has a lot of the janky shortcomings that most mods have, some of which are endemic to the old Source Engine itself.  I can overlook such things in a $20 product, but not in a $60 one."
HalfLife,34y2b6,fpiceail,4,Tue May 5 18:41:00 2015 UTC,"No, it's not ultimately a mod. A mod is exactly that; a modification of an existing game. Black Mesa is a completely rebuilt game; none of the original assets are used."
HalfLife,34y2b6,SuperWeegee4000,1 point,Tue May 5 23:23:59 2015 UTC,"Actually, a bunch of original assets appear. Most of the game is original though."
HalfLife,34y2b6,bloodshot1,1 point,Tue May 5 23:45:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah but they haven't been getting paid for this at all up until now.  They've redone a ton of things up to a higher quality standard for the full release such as environment assets, gun models/animations, voice acting, rebuilt AI, rebalanced campaign with gameplay and bug fixes, and of course the multiplayer with DM/TDM (and CTF down the road) Add on top of all of that the fact that many things had to be reworked to be ported to a newer hybrid source engine with higher limits too.  And they've said that all these things can and probably will still improve with time. Doesn't it stand the reason that the price might have something to do with the fact that they need money to be able to properly develop it to the standards they want, with all the features they want to add? Maybe they also need that money to do things like expand and hire more people so they can even improve too.  And it is not going to be $25 btw, that was a mistake on the store page.  I did expect it to be $5 less personally so I could understand that, but it kind of makes sense considering the quality standard they themselves have met for being a small handful of people working entirely out of their limited spare time between jobs. Plenty of mods big and small fall victim to that, which I think makes the level of quality even more impressive"
HalfLife,34y2b6,XXLpeanuts,1 point,Tue May 5 23:37:02 2015 UTC,"Its far more comparible to a re-release of a game like an ""ultimate"" version (ala many console remakes for new gen and such). Its not just a mod that has gone pay for, its a re-release made by modders, and improved ten fold)."
HalfLife,34y2b6,Nebulous_Idea,7,Thu May 7 13:37:57 2015 UTC,Black Mesa is not a new game nor is it an original game. It is a remastering. I find it a bit much considering it costs more than the original game and currently does not have all the content.
HalfLife,34y2b6,conorf1807,6,Tue May 5 18:44:02 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are saying the BM's multiplayer isn't a big deal because it lacks any of the things (albeit expectedly) that most multiplayer games have, such as a ranking system, progression system, customisation; things that make people want to come back to the game over and over. Now the game is still in early access, but it really doesn't look like these thing will be added at all. Now you could say that 'Half-Life deathmatch and Half-Life 2 deathmatch didn't have these either!' which would be right, and they aren't popular much, and not many people stuck around and played them (especially not now there are things like Garry's Mod around, which you can also open BM maps in btw).  Whilst the multiplayer is a nice addition, it's more of a side feature, a novelty that won't hold many players for long."
HalfLife,34y2b6,Riomaki,3,Tue May 5 20:18:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd also point out that players don't even have the option of using Valve's fancy matchmaking system, a la Left 4 Dead.  This is the same archaic method that Half-Life 2: Deathmatch and Garry's Mod use, where you have to faff about with your own dedicated server or run Hamachi.  I could see multiplayer being a selling point if there was something uniquely Half-Life about it.  Some kind of cooperative mode, like Decay.  Or maybe a mode where one player is a Gargantua.  Humans versus Vorts?  Something like that would be interesting.  But for vanilla deathmatch, there are so many other games that do that.  Believe me, HL2:DM has its diehard fans, but most fans of HL2 came for the single player, and I've no reason to suspect that Black Mesa is any different.  Multiplayer rounds out the overall package, but it doesn't ""make"" the product."
HalfLife,34y2b6,kingkolton9,2,Tue May 5 20:26:19 2015 UTC,"Standard game prices are $60.00 in real life and shouldn't close to that on Steam.  $20.00 is fine for me, though. More polished content, updates and bugfixes, multiplayer and Xen when it releases."
HalfLife,34y2b6,EpicShot649,74,Tue May 5 18:09:32 2015 UTC,Why are you guys all disappointed? I've never played Black Mesa before and I'm excited because I can support the devs and get a more polished game at the same time! Maybe it's not that great for you guys but for us first timers this is awesome news.
HalfLife,34y2b6,Six_Foot_Turkey_64,54,Tue May 5 14:56:00 2015 UTC,Apparently everyone has forgotten that the free version is still available and will continue to be updated. And that they announced this back in Nov 2013.
HalfLife,34y2b6,StealthNinjaKitteh,6,Tue May 5 15:17:49 2015 UTC,So what is the difference between the free and paid version?
HalfLife,34y2b6,Six_Foot_Turkey_64,19,Tue May 5 20:20:50 2015 UTC,"Right now the Steam release (paid version) has quite a lot of improvements over the free mod release from 2012. Outlined here.  However, per the 2013 announcement:   after the Steam release there will be a completely new free version of the game.   It sounds like they plan to update the free version to match most of the improvements the paid version has (stability, visuals, refined gameplay, etc), and of course Xen when that's finished.    However, the Steam version will include features that the free version simply can not have.   I'm guessing this means that the free version *can't* and won't have Steam features like Workshop integration, Trading Cards, achievements, etc."

HalfLife,34y2b6,AwesoomeNinja,3,Wed May 6 16:45:31 2015 UTC,"I would like to know this as well. The community made addons for these missing chapters were well done, so I don't see why they didn't just include it. Oh, and the Hazard Course too..."
HalfLife,34y2b6,wawaboy2,9,Tue May 5 19:14:45 2015 UTC,Does anyone know if this includes the On a Rail Uncut and Surface Tension Uncut that TEXTFAMGUY1 made? I know he's part of the team now.
HalfLife,34y2b6,IAEL-Casey,4,Tue May 5 16:44:00 2015 UTC,"Just fyi I read elsewhere in this thread that they will be available on workshop according to the dev.  They might be there now.  I don't know much about it, just responding in case you didn't see the comment."

HalfLife,34y2b6,Iamsodarncool,9,Tue May 5 22:05:07 2015 UTC,So what are the loading times like on this new engine?
HalfLife,34y2b6,EpicShot649,3,Tue May 5 14:55:54 2015 UTC,"Usually for me it takes like 15 seconds for a quickload and around 30 for a regular loading screen which kinda sucks, but I have never played the original so maybe it's better now."

As far as I'm aware, the main thing is multiplayer, but also some smaller tweaks. Some new voice acting, level design, textures, etc. Nothing that's too huge a overhaul, just small changes.  I'm not saying that it is or is not worth buy, I just want to know more before making any decision."
HalfLife,34y2b6,nightsfrost,14,Tue May 5 15:36:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is.   This is the Press Release on the differences. I can also answer any additional questions that people may have."

What's different with the game engine? Is it an updated Source engine, or did you just improve and modify existing assets, within the same, free mod engine?"
HalfLife,34y2b6,nightsfrost,3,Tue May 5 18:04:14 2015 UTC,The Steam release Engine is a custom hybrid Source Engine. It takes a lot of the best parts of all the source engines and puts them all into one.

HalfLife,34y2b6,IjusthadsexAMA,3,Tue May 5 18:58:49 2015 UTC,The changes to SP are huge. Better lighting in almost every single area of the game + better textures + better everything really.

I would've gladly paid the $20 if there was any substantial content added, but this is basically the exact same thing that was released for free nearly 3 years ago. In 3 years all that was added was a deathmatch mode that no one asked for in this game. There's no OSX or Linux support, no more of the single player added, and basically nothing of value over the free version. I'd be happy to give the developers money if I felt like they had been making decent progress and it would get out of Early Access at some point, but honestly spending 3 years to add a tacked on multiplayer and make a new trailer makes it seem like this will be stuck in Early Access hell."

They use totally different assets as well.  So the devs released the original mod as well as the Steam release without Xen.  It's going to be reworked much more than the rest of the game was.

HalfLife,34y2b6,Six_Foot_Turkey_64,2,Tue May 5 18:42:17 2015 UTC,"It's still confusing for a lot of people.  The level design isn't very straightforward compared to the rest of the game, and it's way to easy to take fall damage doing the most basic tasks.  The difficulty also doesn't scale very well.  The largest onslaught of  enemies (end of Interloper) has the least amount of ammo, and the ammo that is there isn't what you need to kill the controllers and vortigaunt slaves.  I don't mind difficulty, but you have to admit that it's way to easy to back yourself into a corner and end up dead on Xen."

In the original game, the Xen levels were a major weakness, with odd platforming physics and a huge difficulty spike.

It has what you need to build a map, including the .fgd file for Black Mesa.  I've perused around it.  Most entities seem to be set up as you'd expect them to be, based on their closest HL2 equivalents.  There are a little over 5,000 models, sorted by area for ease of finding them.  Most textures follow the HL2 sorting conventions (concrete, tile, etc) but others maintain their old HL1 names (""fifties"" for anything Office Complex related).  You start to realize that HL1 was a relatively simple game (the underlying Quake engine barely had an I/O system), so it makes some sense that there's not too much fancy stuff going on here with the scripting side of things.  At least, that's my first impression.  Most of the NPCs have the same ""default"" setup as BaseNPC in HL2 and little beyond that.  It would be nice if they shipped a sample map or two.  I haven't tried decompiling anything."

So much work for a trailer to a video game by some guys who made the mod/game in their spare time, it's amazing the commitment and the quality that came out. I love the grainy aspect, and the awkwardness of the solider, and how it's advertising BM for what it is, a weapons research facility. It helps put into context things so much more than the original Valve game did IMO, where to me, it's just running through and shooting aliens and soldiers. I love when understanding the actual events is made easy, and helps me get immersed that much more within games. The short flash of the room where the resonance cascade occurs as it's destroyed and in flames gives me chills, combined with the G-man. I'm such a nerd..."

HalfLife,350v3s,HyvelTjuven,4,Wed May 6 07:19:59 2015 UTC,"New voice acting, performance improvements, I think slightly better graphics, and this last one I'm listing I don't know is exactly an improvement: the movement system from Portal 2. IE, when you run and jump and try to strafe, you aren't going to have at all the same experience as in Half Life 1, or even the original mod. You jump for longer and your strafes sort of die out half way through with much less turning required.  Also there is a maximum momentum limit whenever you touch the ground so you can't go very much faster than sprint speed, and you can't go into a crouch bhop as easily as it interrupts your jumping when you transition from crouch to jump and vice versa. I'm not too disappointed, but after I finish Black Mesa, if I ever want to replay HL1 I'm going to just do it in the original game itself. No bhopping is a pretty big dealbreaker for me, it's like 80% of the fun, just blasting through the levels with bhopping.  Edit: Jumping length is actually exactly the same as HL1, I was probably thinking of CS 1.6. Nevertheless, strafing is almost all gone and there's no sv_airaccelerate to bring it back sadly."
HalfLife,350v3s,super6plx,4,Wed May 6 07:59:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed, no bhopping is awful and imo completely breaks the multiplayer."
HalfLife,350v3s,Hubbleshubbles,3,Wed May 6 08:16:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, if you get the crouch jump boost, it's only good for one hop. Then you wait 0.2 sec and hop again, and slow to regular sprint speed again.  Granted, this way is more realistic and you could argue more fair, as you actually would slow down after hitting the ground in real life, but I don't think it's as fun as you have to do a new crouch hop every time you need the boost. It's not like it realistically limits you that much anyway, as you only slow to sprint speed for about 0.3 seconds before you can hop again."
HalfLife,350v3s,super6plx,3,Wed May 6 08:22:00 2015 UTC,"This all sounds like a big improvement to me, but i dont really like non-realism mp games. Not that HL/BM is at all realistic to begin with, but anything that brings it ever so slightly more in line with RL is good to me."
HalfLife,350v3s,XXLpeanuts,2,Thu May 7 15:14:15 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Bhopping is an abuse of the physics and shouldn't be possible, especially in multiplayer."
HalfLife,350v3s,Iamsodarncool,5,Wed May 6 10:55:27 2015 UTC,"If you say so, I think it's integral to Half-Life. MP is just way too slow without it.

HalfLife,350v3s,Hubbleshubbles,2,Wed May 6 11:02:48 2015 UTC,"Yep, bhopping started in quake and it's in full force in MP in that game. It's integral to that game too."

You have to approach FPS design in a different way when you build for controllers which have a fixed turn rate.  This is something the Halo series does exceptionally well.  A big part of that is making sure that enemies tend to stay in front of the player.  A console player can't just flip around instantaneously, so anything that hits them from behind will come across as cheap.  Half-Life 2 wasn't built from that perspective and so the experience on a controller is somewhat overwhelming and frustrating."

It's not on the front page anywhere, unless you click on Top Sellers and find it in the #2 slot.

HalfLife,34yw77,Riomaki,3,Tue May 5 20:21:20 2015 UTC,"Because it's early access, it's not the final released version. That's the most likely reason I can think of, anyways."

HalfLife,34yw77,HypnoToad0,2,Tue May 5 19:23:17 2015 UTC,"why is it taking them so long?   They've spent 11 years on this game. Rebuilding and re-imagining Half-Life from the ground-up. Working in their spare time with their own money.  The reason they still haven't finished Xen is because the original Xen levels by Valve weren't really all that good, so they want to entirely redesign that entire final section of the game. That's a lot more difficult than just tweaking/updating. They need to come up with their own ideas for Xen that live up to the standards that Half-Life sets."
HalfLife,34yw77,Six_Foot_Turkey_64,7,Tue May 5 21:05:35 2015 UTC,"Plus, Xen is unlike any other area in Half-Life.  It was modest work back in 1998, because all you needed was a new texture set and a few props.  That's why a lot of older FPS games were unafraid to do these one-off, fantastical environments - it didn't require a lot of additional work to make them, relatively speaking.  But now, to properly re-imagine Xen, you'd need a ton of custom assets and materials you wouldn't use anywhere else, all made at the same level of quality as the rest of the mod.  It's a pretty tall order, honestly."

The person behind the ""uncut"" mods actually joined the team, but decided against putting them in because he felt they weren't up to the rest of the mod's standards.  They are however, available on the workshop."
HalfLife,34xdio,bothanspy1337,1 point,Tue May 5 19:24:32 2015 UTC,Interesting. I'll probably download that when I get the game.
HalfLife,34xdio,nihilinth,20,Tue May 5 19:37:31 2015 UTC,"No. You're not the only one. I also have no idea why anyone would hype THIS MUCH over it. The post on the front page right now is entitled; ""ITS HAPPENING"" when all that's happening is Black Mesa being released. It's just a mod and while it's cool and all it's been a long time coming."
HalfLife,34xdio,Froggmann5,13,Tue May 5 12:33:18 2015 UTC,"You know what I would have done?  I would have waited until Xen is finished. Then I would have attempted to co-ordinate with Valve/Marc Laidlaw to get Michael Shapiro to record extra lines for the Gman at the end of the game. It could potentially pave the way forward for Half-Life 3, it would be something canon and legitimate and new.  That would warrant hyping up the fans/community."
HalfLife,34xdio,Honesty_Addict,25,Tue May 5 12:48:38 2015 UTC,"Jesus, there's still no Xen? The only way I could make sense of the hype was by assuming that Xen was finally finished. It seems pretty dumb to me that they're cashing in their hype stock for a mod that is barely more finished than it was two years ago. That's just bewildering."
HalfLife,34xdio,DocJawbone,9,Tue May 5 13:05:31 2015 UTC,"IKR? I just found out about this now and it totally pulled the hype rug from under my feet. I can't believe how hyped this is considering it's already been released. Unless, I dunno they added new content somehow?"
HalfLife,34xdio,Honesty_Addict,6,Tue May 5 13:11:49 2015 UTC,"It looks like deathmatch is the main new content. They're not doing anything wrong, but the hype feels cynical and badly coordinated. It's like they earned a voucher for One Hype and they're cashing it in for... this?"
HalfLife,34xdio,thatsnotanargument,14,Tue May 5 13:35:54 2015 UTC,It's a proxy for Half Life 3. We are so starved that any scrap of positive news gets us excited
HalfLife,34xdio,lud1120,1 point,Tue May 5 12:38:32 2015 UTC,"Black Mesa kinda is Half Life 3 for me, and maybe, maybe the developers are working with Valve on the actual sequel, who knows.  Considering how Xen still not even relased, we will be waiting even more years though."
HalfLife,34xdio,Ancel3,5,Tue May 5 23:18:17 2015 UTC,"Does anybody know how long the Xen should take? I really want to buy the mod and support the developers, but I just can't justify spending $20 on a game that's not only the exact same as the game I've already played, but is also missing the final part of the game.  When they come out with the Xen update, then I'll happily buy it."
HalfLife,34xdio,reaffi,4,Tue May 5 20:23:08 2015 UTC,I'm hyped a little bit because it's something Half-Life related and there are some improvements. Also a good ol' HL Multiplayer
HalfLife,34xdio,Exarkon,8,Tue May 5 13:11:38 2015 UTC,Much improved version + deathmatch. I waited to play Black Mesa until this version and I'm exited to replay Half-Life with updated graphics.
HalfLife,34xdio,briggswag,5,Tue May 5 10:41:14 2015 UTC,What has been improved? Genuinely interested.
HalfLife,34xdio,DocJawbone,16,Tue May 5 10:48:13 2015 UTC,"Models, bugs, viewmodels, ai, sounds, voice acting, pretty much everything you can think of and its on a shiny new version of source (not source 2, but a newer branch)"
HalfLife,34xdio,Hubbleshubbles,3,Tue May 5 11:16:31 2015 UTC,"Improved AI is good news, I'll give you that."

HalfLife,34xdio,Riomaki,2,Tue May 5 11:24:28 2015 UTC,HL2 Deathmatch spawned some beautiful beautiful user created maps. I used to love seeing the community go mental and just CREATE! I hope that the same can happen again.
HalfLife,34xdio,onboarderror,2,Tue May 5 14:31:18 2015 UTC,"Well, look at it this way.  This could just be me, but I see absolutely no trace of Black Mesa on Steam's front page.  Not in the header scroll.  Not in the Popular New Releases.  Nowhere.  Of course, you can search for it.  And it is currently the #2 Top Seller despite this.  But Valve doesn't seem to have lifted a finger to promote it.  You can read into that however you want, but it does seem like Black Mesa needed to build the hype and promotion themselves.  Honestly, as hype for Valve-related products go, a countdown timer is pretty tame."
HalfLife,34yd9p,Fever308,2,Tue May 5 16:11:15 2015 UTC,Nice this and black mesa and vr headset and steam boxes this is an awesome year to be a valve fan

HalfLife,350x12,e3valdas,2,Wed May 6 04:34:01 2015 UTC,I had the same (I think) problem. Everything turned black except for the HUD. After I changed my graphics card the problem disapeared.
HalfLife,350x12,Gondile,2,Wed May 6 12:17:38 2015 UTC,Maybe someone should call an electrical engineer into Black Mesa to repair the lights?

HalfLife,34xxul,Jonex_,2,Tue May 5 14:21:08 2015 UTC,"The only way we'd go back and do some sort of retro value meal like a Big Mac is if a bunch of people at Valve wanted to.  I think if we were to go back and do another Big Mac without using what we've learned from shipping the McRib or the Shamrock Shake, it would be a huge mistake.  But I don't think that means what people are worried it might mean."
HalfLife,34xxul,bothanspy1337,2,Tue May 5 19:28:58 2015 UTC,I've lost all hope that we'll ever see another Big Mac from Valve. There's no point in making another one.
HalfLife,34xxul,DennisvdG,2,Tue May 5 20:11:57 2015 UTC,We'll be lucky if we even get a McDouble.

HalfLife,34xxul,Richex112,2,Tue May 5 14:54:07 2015 UTC,Someone said it played a trailer for the new multiplayer.
HalfLife,34xxul,Richex112,2,Tue May 5 14:54:45 2015 UTC,Ignore everything. Black mesa is in early access and Xen is still not here
HalfLife,34xxul,eugd,1 point,Tue May 5 16:17:02 2015 UTC,"it's literally not-very-much. They still haven't finished Xen, so it's just a more polished version of what we've already gotten. Plus a deathmatch multiplayer nobody cares about."
HalfLife,34xxul,Rhys345,6,Tue May 5 14:43:21 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I kind of care about that. Think of the new crossfire!  Obviously not buying it just yet. I'm going to wait for reviews."

HalfLife,350avo,desimaldevil,1 point,Wed May 6 11:21:49 2015 UTC,"I just found this video, I didn't even know this footage existed! Goes to show that the Xen chapters were already pretty far in development before they decided to completely change Xen.  Edit: I'd just like to point out that this misleading title was taken straight from the video itself... Which I didn't create..."
HalfLife,350avo,briggswag,7,Wed May 6 01:14:39 2015 UTC,"These aren't official, these are a fan port of the hl1 xen maps you can find here"
HalfLife,34xoqd,Sportsfanno1,16,Tue May 5 12:46:05 2015 UTC,"Half life is a LOT more than ""shoot what comes at you"", that's why its such an amazing series. The storytelling is amazing"
HalfLife,34xoqd,briggswag,8,Tue May 5 12:50:23 2015 UTC,"Yup, you could find different ways to kill your enemys besides shooting at them. You really don't need the weapons though you could prop kill them with the gravity gun."
HalfLife,34xoqd,Elitesnicker,1 point,Tue May 5 13:03:48 2015 UTC,"That's cool, so a bit like hitman?"
HalfLife,34xoqd,euricus,14,Tue May 5 13:15:13 2015 UTC,"No, not really at all like hitman, it's not a stealth focused game, but it did revolutionise the FPS genre when it came out. Definitely worth a play."
HalfLife,34xoqd,mattslaughing,2,Tue May 5 13:34:04 2015 UTC,"Great characters, well designed levels and visual design, epic scale story, but I think the best part is the gameplay. Very engaging gameplay."
HalfLife,34xoqd,battletactics,8,Tue May 5 16:13:57 2015 UTC,"The story is fantastic.  People ask what my favorite game(s) are.  Deus Ex is my number one.  The Half-Life series is # 2.  The story is so good.  So well thought out and imaginative.  It's like a book, but better."
HalfLife,34xoqd,reaffi,8,Tue May 5 13:09:47 2015 UTC,"More like a visual book with few words, because you need to figure out yourself what's happening."
HalfLife,34xoqd,battletactics,5,Tue May 5 13:21:45 2015 UTC,Excellent description
HalfLife,34xoqd,Huckzel,7,Tue May 5 13:26:26 2015 UTC,"The Source engine allows you to kill your enemies in a creative way. You can throw stuff at them with the gravity gun or use the environment, like a crane, explosives, or flammable materials.  Besides the regular combat there are a two vehicle sections in Half-Life 2 and another one in episode two. So you can drive over enemies or knock over the supports of the platform they are standing on, all while evading their attacks.  The story is there, but mostly in the background. Personally I really dig the 1984-ish vibe I get from the environments."
HalfLife,34xoqd,Jonex_,3,Tue May 5 14:21:50 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of puzzle solving and a great story to go along with the shooting parts. It's very well paced, not all of it is violence."
HalfLife,34xoqd,OprahsCat,3,Tue May 5 13:16:08 2015 UTC,It's a purchase you won't regret. Half-Life is my absolute favorite game ever. I'm not really big in FPS anymore but imo it has one of the best storylines in all of FPS. There's so much depth to the story and it's a story you'll fall in love with from Half Life to Half Life 2: Ep. 2.
HalfLife,34xoqd,kamil1210,3,Tue May 5 15:46:07 2015 UTC,For me it is just FPS
HalfLife,34xoqd,paradoxasauruser,2,Tue May 5 17:13:40 2015 UTC,"it depends on what games you're thinking of when you say FPS. if you're thinking Doom, the Half-Life series is a lot more intelligent (not to disparage Doom) and controlled in how the gunfights play out. if you're thinking multiplayer FPSes, the single-player campaign is very different from that - it's not about twitch shooting. the story and pacing are largely unparalleled even today in my opinion. it's very cinematic, visceral, and engaging. there are plenty of puzzlers, exposition, platforming sections - none too complex, but enough to diversify the action.  when i first played it, i enjoyed it, but felt it was somewhat overrated and even inferior to the original half-life. i recently revisited it with, i think, a more critical but also more informed eye in terms of the state of gaming and first person shooters in general, and am happy to say i was actually blown away by how remarkable it truly was despite my inability to appreciate it my first time through. (This not to discredit anyone who doesn't share my views, but for me personally, that was the transition i found.)"
HalfLife,34xoqd,JIH7,1 point,Tue May 5 17:04:03 2015 UTC,"Unpopular opinion here: I thought it was just alright honestly. If you don't like shooters this game isn't going to change your opinion. It's a fun romp through a world with a pretty good story, but it isn't going to change the way you look at games or anything. At least it didn't for me.  Now time to clench and grimace for the onslaught of down votes I'm about to get :/  Edit: Take this with a grain of salt though. I haven't played the game in years and may not have the best memory of it."
HalfLife,34xoqd,DennisvdG,1 point,Tue May 5 18:51:24 2015 UTC,"Honest question, not trying to be a douche: Why are you on this sub? I mean, how is this sub interesting to you when you merely thought HL was ""just alright""? Are you just really bored?"
HalfLife,34xoqd,JIH7,1 point,Wed May 6 12:25:53 2015 UTC,"I was interested in what the Black Mesa timer was all about and figured it would be the best place to look. Afterwards I clicked around a bit. I definitely don't dislike Half Life, so I thought it would be cool to see what else was going on besides Black Mesa stuff."

HalfLife,34y10f,fpiceail,1 point,Tue May 5 15:01:33 2015 UTC,You should absolutely have to pay for it. Honestly you should be glad they let you play most of the damn game for free. Why on Earth would you think they would work for almost a decade on a game for absolutely no return?  And you are seriously pissed about $20? That is dirt cheap for such a huge game. I've bought indie 3DS titles that cost more than $20. Standard game pricing is at around $60.

HalfLife,34y9ju,BunkBuy,3,Tue May 5 16:37:34 2015 UTC,"pretty much yeah   Noted, literally.   i like shotguns   I like the SPAS-12 because it's elegant, yet deadly. Like a butterfly made of steel with razor sharp talons.  So, nothing like a butterfly.  What did you dislike the most and why?"
HalfLife,34y9ju,Riomaki,3,Tue May 5 16:56:06 2015 UTC,the thing i disliked the most was probably anything that involves striders because of how fucking fast you die to them
HalfLife,34y9ju,paradoxasauruser,2,Tue May 5 16:57:29 2015 UTC,"I hated that the only ammo types that can be used is hard to get to and slow to fire.  If we could crowbar their legs, they'd be much easier."
HalfLife,34y9ju,paradoxasauruser,3,Tue May 5 17:21:39 2015 UTC,"That is a really, really broad question.  You sure you don't want to narrow that down a bit?  Like, favorite environment?  Favorite gameplay moment?  Favorite weapon or enemy? ;)"
HalfLife,34y9ju,Elitesnicker,2,Tue May 5 16:13:36 2015 UTC,"How about your favorite environment, weapon, and moment?"
HalfLife,34y9ju,Gondile,2,Tue May 5 16:18:06 2015 UTC,"god, it's hard to narrow down.  under the bridge from HL2 is an obvious one. when you go back underground after On a Rail and do the underwater fights with the ichthyosaurs in HL1. believe me, i absolutely hated it, it terrified me, but the atmosphere and isolated feeling was just so on point i have to take my hat off to it."
HalfLife,34y9ju,Gondile,1 point,Tue May 5 17:26:53 2015 UTC,Thank you; noted. What parts didn't you like?
HalfLife,34y9ju,Safadoondog,3,Tue May 5 17:54:37 2015 UTC,"mm... there were times when On a Rail dragged on. Xen, while absolutely fascinating from a locational standpoint, suffered in that it changed a lot of the rules the game had taught you up until that point. in 2, i felt the big bad fight was a little underwhelming from a combat standpoint. loved the symbolism and setting, just felt the gameplay lacked a little."

So AFAIK most developers on the project are just doing it in their free time."
HalfLife,34wlbd,nicereddy,2,Tue May 5 14:36:21 2015 UTC,"All of the developers have day jobs, most of which aren't even in the game or computer industry (this is directly from the Twitch stream they did a few weeks ago).  From what I read back when the mod first released, the developer forums would often go quiet for months.  I don't know if that's still the case, but it's hard to develop what is essentially a AAA game when you only have  a couple of hours free every night."

HalfLife,34vnsj,NioA_,22,Mon May 4 23:02:09 2015 UTC,"Man, these are awesome. I always wanted an outside perspective on the disaster. I also like how the first one, the evacuation area is 75 miles, and it sounds like the situation is under control. But the second one, the area is 150 miles, and it sounds like the government is finally realizing what's really going on."
HalfLife,34vnsj,GuyWithTooMuchTime,15,Mon May 4 23:56:13 2015 UTC,"I am in love with the EAS (or emergency broadcast system - whatever), so for the BMS devs and team to showcase how the outside world was handing this was very immersive as well as cool. I also loved that fake little cover up - presented as a news article - that replaced the website for a bit. My only issue with the article was the date (i like to go into the elements and edit the date to say 2009, May 16th).  And, yeah. The first transmission was most likely set out after the military first arrived to the scene. No heavy weapons were required during this time (hence the small 75 mile radius). But, as soon as Freeman launched the missile into orbit, began killing marines at a rapid pace, and more Xen forces were assaulting the facility, heavy weapons had to be used, and with this came consequences; nuclear arms and wider death toll - friendly fire included (which is why the safety zone had to be 150 miles away). This is seen in the second transmission. Quite interesting.  I love Black Mesa. It expands on the lore for me, and it serves as the next best product that's Half-Life related (besides the very obvious third hl installment)."
HalfLife,34vnsj,GuyWithTooMuchTime,1 point,Tue May 5 00:27:44 2015 UTC,"I know it's been a while, but I just realized looking at the transcript, the first is at the request of local authorities, the second is the New Mexico Dept. of Emergency Services. It also mentions something about fever and nausea or whatever, as if they're afraid that the aliens are transmitting diseases or maybe the headcrab zombies."
HalfLife,34vnsj,Riomaki,5,Tue May 12 16:22:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it would have been great to see a mod that dealt with the local aftermath of Black Mesa like that.  There was some time between Black Mesa and the Seven Hour War when people would be asking a lot of questions and trying to understand what happened, and their government fighting in vain to keep the whole thing a secret."
HalfLife,34vnsj,eriman,6,Tue May 5 00:20:08 2015 UTC,Neat. But what was that about diseases? Sounds almost like it could be a tie-in with L4D. Reminds me of Crysis 2 actually.
HalfLife,34vnsj,kingkolton9,8,Tue May 5 00:15:52 2015 UTC,"Not sure.  One thing that I found hilarious as well as coincidental was that I was actually wondering about whether or not the Xen aliens could've spread some sort of disease among'st the science personnel during the incident. It was always a little thought / fan idea. I jokingly named the disease ""Xenonym."" So, it was funny for me to hear about the mentions of a potential disease.  For it being applicable to the Black Mesa story? I'm not entirely sure. It could be related to some nuclear failures in the facility (Forget About Freeman and Blast Pit showcase this). It could also be related to how the Xenians (i call them this since i'm lazy) began bringing in parts of their own environment (floura, those ""web walls,"" the trampolines, etc) into the facility, because in Questionable Ethics, there was a room with a pseudo-Xen environment in there, but researchers still required gas masks.   Overall, we may (or may not) find out about it later on."
HalfLife,34vnsj,CaptainDefect,4,Tue May 5 00:23:22 2015 UTC,"The fact that headcrabs can even cause the zombies in the Scientists is a biological impossibility. Our immune system and biochemistry are so far apart, that if it were real life it should be literally impossible.  Then again, a guy in a big orange suit is running around different universes kicking ass on an empty stomach and soda, so it's not too far fetched."

HalfLife,34vnsj,eggsmith,2,Tue May 5 04:58:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it would be limited to stuff we know to be possible, which pretty much means stuff we can already do, so all the fiction gets taken out of it."

HalfLife,34waqf,kingkolton9,8,Tue May 5 02:15:18 2015 UTC,"I definitely got a whiff of that in the times I've checked there.  I remember there was some thread from a mapper where another mapper just ripped into his work mercilessly.  I don't remember if it was a BMS mapper showing off new work to fans, or a BMS mapper criticizing someone else's, but it was, as you say, a really toxic display.  I'm all for the ""tough love"" approach, but at the same time, there's a line between constructive criticism and simply berating the author because you get some bizarre ego trip out of it."
HalfLife,34waqf,Riomaki,5,Tue May 5 02:49:47 2015 UTC,"I think that it can partly be blamed on the length of time between anything substantial (the mod came out 2012 IIRC), and in-between the devs are there in the forum to constantly remind them 'no Xen yet' or 'no multiplayer yet'. Being as it's a web forum that's pretty separate from anywhere else on the web, it's becomes a small space and makes it easy for the community there to break down.  I often find you can relate communities to physics; in this case, lower densities tend to boil faster."

HalfLife,34tjvq,SlappyCromwell,5,Tue May 5 00:14:11 2015 UTC,"The purpose behind the Combine OverWiki was to create an on-line volume of Half-Life knowledge that's for the community and run by the community. We host an ad-free, thoroughly moderated encyclopedia geared directly towards the fans by ourselves and pay for it out of our own pocket. We've taken the time to track down lost sources and even contact current and former developers to obtain and present thoroughly cited and verifiable information you won't find anywhere else. We love Half-Life just as much as you do, and we think it deserves as such.  Wikia, on the other hand, is a for-profit endeavor that regularly sacrifices content and readability for more ad-space and additional intrusive cruft. They don't care about quality. Their goal is to make as many ad impressions as possible, hence mass quantity is key to their endeavors. We don't believe the Half-Life series deserves such shabby treatment. These progressively declining practices is why numerous other wikis have also broken off from Wikia, such as the Doom Wiki which I've long held as a personal standard to live up to."

There are entire web sites out there devoted to analyzing trends and creating phony articles based on them.  Believe me, I wish Google News was a lot more useful than it is.  But, like Google itself, a lot of tech-related news is compromised by intentionally misleading sites like Fuse Joplin, KDramaStars, etc.  Legitimate news gets buried under them because they know how to work the system and get hits, thanks to their phony headlines, which moves them up the search rankings.  I believe many of them are run by bots, so there's no actual person behind any of the articles."

HalfLife,34u3dc,Tmacster1,2,Mon May 4 19:50:36 2015 UTC,"Actually, I believe it serves as a decoy (obviously not to us but to fictional civilians), and is meant to allude to a rampant disease.

Can you form an arguement for why you think so, or explain to me how you think my reasoning in the post is flawed?

HalfLife,34t77w,Jonex_,2,Mon May 4 15:34:16 2015 UTC,"I disagree, the best game would have been Garry's Mod. It already has established paid mods, endorsed by the developers. For a time the official forums even had a section specifically for selling scripts, until third-party websites took over that role.  Significantly less likely for free mods to suddenly become paid as they already are paid. Large selection of paid mods that can be moved to the workshop, so there's already a full library. Very little, if any, backlash as it's only making something that's already available more easily accessed. Modders would have had to have a competitive cut (much larger than 25%) for Steam to compete with third-party sites.  It would have just made sense. Of course, the botched Skyrim launch has left them in a pretty bad situation, it's unlikely they'll be able to do anything similar soon."

HalfLife,34q4ab,Mackintosh_Plus,-1,Mon May 4 06:08:16 2015 UTC,It's been heavily implied. God knows I'll be majorly disappointed if they release it on Steam without the Xen chapters.
HalfLife,34q4ab,Mageoftheyear,1 point,Mon May 4 09:01:04 2015 UTC,It has never been implied. Have you been following development? Because they've made it crystal clear Xen is not ready. Sixty seconds of searching this sub over the last few days will confirm that for you.
HalfLife,34q4ab,pademakos,2,Mon May 4 09:11:22 2015 UTC,What is this?
HalfLife,34q4ab,ZeekySantos,13,Sun May 3 19:03:16 2015 UTC,"Steam has trading cards that drop when you log playtime in a game.

HalfLife,34q4ab,Voter96,9,Mon May 4 01:37:36 2015 UTC,"TF2 is F2P, but it requires you to spend money in the store before cards drop for you and the more money you spend in the store the more cards drop. I don't think valve will let trading cards drop for free."

But we aren't dropping all support for the free version. In fact shortly after the Steam release there will be a completely new free version of the game. We also plan to open source our maps and some game assets to the modding community!  Purchasing the Steam version of Black Mesa is more about supporting the team and our efforts than anything else. However, the Steam version will include features that the free version simply can not have. We will be paying careful attention to feedback, and you'll have a very real say in how the final game turns out."

The site is for Black Mesa (linked from the official site and registered to Hubi, the webmaster of Black Mesa), the fan-made full recreation of Half-Life in the Source engine. The mod was released a couple of years ago, but it was incomplete, with the last chapter, Xen, missing from the game, as well as the promised multiplayer portion of the game yet to be released. Shortly after that initial release, Black Mesa went through Steam Greenlight and was approved by Valve to be released as a stand-alone game on Steam. Since then, the team went silent again, until recently when they showed some new media and did a livestream of the multiplayer portion of the game. Now they've changed this long-known website, bmrf.us, to show a countdown, which is counting down to 5/5/2015 8:47AM UTC-6."
HalfLife,34n7sr,Henry132,-2,Sun May 3 20:02:09 2015 UTC,"So it's non-news, then."
HalfLife,34lpwg,hitalec,76,Sat May 2 07:21:40 2015 UTC,"Additional comments by dev a few pages back:   Again, everyone who says this vastly underestimates how much work Xen is. Xen would still be extremely huge amounts of work, even if we were aiming for just a straight 1:1 remake. You still wouldn't have it today, even if we'd gone that route and put everything into it.  Our version of Xen is not extremely ambitious because we're making it super long. We're making it longer, yes, but it certainly won't be a third of the game as someone said. It's super ambitious because the detail and design are meticulous and extremely difficult to pull off in the Source engine. Trust me, we tried looking at how 1:1 would look/play. Many times. It sucked. We wanted to do better than that. We can do a lot better than that. Game design is hard. Designing an organic and beautiful alien border world on the ageing Source engine? Creating a believable and fully functional ecosystem which has detailed science behind everything? Creating some of the most ambitious and beautiful landscapes and skyboxes the Source engine has ever seen? It. Takes. Time. Xen's landscape design, to make it right, requires a lot more attention and refinement than anything earthbound by orders of magnitude, and requires a very different design pipeline to the rest of the game. Much more time consuming and hard to get right.  Honestly, whenever anyone makes posts about how we should have prioritised Xen and how it's ""bizzare"" and ""selfish,"" that we're doing stuff on MP or whatever, it really does come across to me as ""I want Xen why aren't they giving me Xen?"" There are a lot of circumstances which have led our team to be in the position we are in. They are complex. Nobody on the team wanted to just work silently on Xen until it came out. Lots of us, without the prospect of the MP release on the horizon, would have dropped out. The project may have died. It's as simple as that. We're bloody human, we have fleeting motivation, we face challenges. And it's not like MP is the only thing we've been working on, either.  We have had huge numbers of people complaining to us that we should have just bunged the BMS mod on Steam so they could get the Steam version, as soon as we were Greenlit. The legal requirement for us to switch engines prevented that from being possible. The engine port fiasco set us back hugely. It stalled development for a very long time and crushed a lot of our motivations. But, when it was said and done, we didn't want to do just a straight port of the mod release, but we knew we did want to get BMS on Steam before Xen was done, so we could keep deploying updates for people and build up a community, while we finished Xen. We wanted to take the ""mod port"" to the next level. So we've done what we think is the best compromise for everyone. There's a fun and cool MP. The existing SP parts have been touched up hugely based on feedback from before. At the end of the day, it's a compromise. You can't satisfy everyone. We've poured huge amounts of love and hard work into all of this and we're extremely proud of it. I know I am. It's always a bit disheartening to see posts like yours, for that reason.  Everyone seems to be forgetting that MP was an original part of Half-Life too, we haven't just run off and started doing whatever we feel like while we completely ignore Xen. You will get Xen. It will be amazing. We need time."
HalfLife,34lpwg,icEPiraka,16,Sat May 2 07:22:54 2015 UTC,"As completely understandable this all is, going into full ""hype-mode,"" with the countdown clock and such, is a horrible idea. It gives the impression of something ""big"" on the horizon, and to the average person, Xen is ""big,"" but MP and updates to the campaign are not. Thus I feel, unless the devs have something really crazy up their sleeves, a lot of people are going to be severely underwhelmed, disappointed, and angry that the hype was built up, and they will simply ignore this release until Xen truly is released."
HalfLife,34lpwg,Mageoftheyear,9,Sat May 2 18:44:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this. I'm not disappointed because we've been told since before the mod's initial release to expect up-to-Xen, then MP, then Xen.  Since then the only thing to have changed was the commercial development of the Steam version - and we were still told to expect up-to-Xen, then MP, then Xen.  So you all know what to expect on Tuesday right? Up-to-Xen with the possibility of a beta version of MP."
HalfLife,34lpwg,Mageoftheyear,4,Sat May 2 18:03:33 2015 UTC,"I think the current suggestion is that MP will be included, for sure.  And yea, I posted this because I respect the devs and also feel like people probably have, understandably, come to a different conclusion about what they will be getting. I think it's better for everyone if this info was highlighted in a post so that it can reach viewers that would not be aware of it otherwise, so they don't get amped up for five days."

Then imagine how hard and complex half life 3 would've been. That may have crushed their dreams and motivation and hopes about even beginning on half life 3.   This makes me sad because it's true, no one has the motivation to even start working on half life 3.    They took 6/7  years for half life 2.   If they would work on half life 3 they would've needed maybe 10/14 years! Just imagine! I may be over reacting but that's because I'm seeing the big picture now.  I've always been bitching about it being released and Shit like that but never tought about how hard this would be.  Damn, these guys invest not days or weeks or months, they invest years of their life to give us these games, unlike other companies who only need a fucking year for a retarded game for 14 year kids.  This is why we belong to the elite."

HalfLife,34lpwg,Vladeslav,10,Sat May 2 21:52:05 2015 UTC,"While I do kinda want Xen, I'm not that disappointed in this statement. They do a lot of work, and I'd rather have their promised amazing redesigned Xen than a boring 1:1 remake that took barely any effort."
HalfLife,34lpwg,Oooch,24,Sat May 2 15:30:53 2015 UTC,"Let me preface by saying I don't mind if they need more time doing Xen. They should take all the time they need.  Now that being said, my expectations were way off. I had the wrong idea entirely - I thought the entire wait for steam release was due to Xen. (Personally I prefer MP to Xen though.)  It sounds like they're going in a good direction with it though. I can't wait to see what they're doing with it."
HalfLife,34lpwg,bobeo,37,Sat May 2 08:14:27 2015 UTC,"How can you prefer MP to Xen? I would rather see a bizzare alien world redone in newer engine, than generic online running around. I guess you and me have different tastes."

HalfLife,34lpwg,Rafq,1 point,Sat May 2 21:19:55 2015 UTC,"TFC came along much later in the release cycle; we only had standard deathmatch at release. It was very much like Q1/Q2 arena style DM -- fast paced, hectic, and a lot of fun... but there's a million other variants already. So, while it most definitely had its place in the MP world, its nothing revolutionary enough that I would have put time into it.  That said, it sounds like they more undertook it as a pet project, something to break up the monotony of what they knew was to come with Xen."

HalfLife,34lpwg,Plazmatic,11,Sun May 3 17:22:20 2015 UTC,"I really don't get people anger. Not only they did release what they had so far, but they did it for free. And they are still continuing.

HalfLife,34lpwg,CP_Officer,3,Sat May 2 11:49:28 2015 UTC,"I don't understand, ""temper our expectations"" despite the fact that they made this arg and everything? its been 2 years since the original release, why wouldn't we have expected xen by now? And if not xen, at least some actual game playable content update, you know, like MP, which seems to also not be coming out.   Why build hype for nothing? They would have been better off not saying anything about the 5th of may if they aren't actually going to give us anything, I would have been 100% fine with them just not saying anything at this point."
HalfLife,34lpwg,TheJonesReddit,2,Sat May 2 20:35:48 2015 UTC,Because they learned the whole overblown promotion thing from Valve.  You can't just drop an obvious update on Steam like every other developer.  You have to make a giant ARG out of it.

HL1's graphics were exceptional in 1999, but not anymore. Half-Life 2 has great gameplay and graphics. HL2's story is mostly independent of HL1. Even if you played HL1, you won't know what's happening at the start of HL2.   In this sub, when people ask whether they should start with HL1 or HL2, a common response is something like ""HL1 is an amazing game and if you can't see past the outdated graphics that means you're a shallow person who does not deserve the Half-Life experience."" Personally, I'd hate to see someone miss HL2 just because they didn't finish HL1. They're both incredibly fun games.  My advice: Take a look at some HL1 screenshots. If you know that the graphics will prevent you from enjoying the game, skip to HL2. Otherwise, if you want the whole Half-Life experience, start with HL1."

HalfLife,34naom,EpicShot649,11,Sat May 2 18:52:06 2015 UTC,"Or you could buy HL2, (and since you have a budget issue) then download the Black Mesa mod that runs in the HL2 engine. That way you'll be able to play both games (mostly) without having to buy or pirate both games.   Note: The Black Mesa mod does not contain the end 3rd of HL1 as it is still in development.

When I went back and played HL1 I realized I hadn't missed out on much of the story.   People saying you need to play HL1 first are saying that because they don't want you to miss out on the gameplay.

HalfLife,34k4mb,kingkolton9,2,Fri May 1 22:21:42 2015 UTC,I didn't. A friend of mine did.  I'll ask what was used.  It feels like premium paper on par with the other ones I have.   They both look great but the portal one had slightly lower resolution so if you're up close you can see its not perfect.  (Theres a couch and shelf in front of it so you dont generally get close.  Heh. )The good thing is the ink and printing process actually smooths things out quite a bit more. So it doesn't look pixelated at all.  And these are both 27x40 sized posters.   The half life one looks great.  I added the text and valve logo using a half life 2 TTF font I found on the web so it scaled great.

Very square, pretty open, and some wall space for movie one-sheets (big posters, really).  So I got a bunch of those, and it was hard as hell to figure out what to pick out of all the movies I've ever liked.  Anyway, a year later I realized that I had a bit more wall space to play with, and so I got these ones and put them up.  Very happy with how they turned out.

Home Theatre Album  These were taken 6 or 7 months ago.  So some minor changes since then.    The HTPC is a Core i5 with a Zotac GTX 770 in it.  The projector is an Epson 8350 shooting to a 106"" screen.  It was, from everything I researched, the best projector in my price range (under $1500).  Wanted to go 3D, because I thought 3D gaming would be really cool on that, but all of the 3D projectors in that price range had really bad input lag.  The 8350 by contrast has phenomenal response time, so it's been great.  Don't regret it at all.  The pictures in the album are the screen up, screen down, the projector, the back of the projector, picture with the lights off, picture with the lights on, and a dark picture with the lights off.  I've always been a movie nut, and I've always wanted a home theatre, so I saved, and saved, and saved, and finally got it.  And now I can die a happy man.  But I hope I don't.

Honestly though it's been so long now that I wonder if anything is going on at all. Worse is that some signs of disinterest are popping up like Gabe's comments recently that to make a new game they would need a lot of people interested and on board (or something like that). Also, complete silence for HL2's 10th b-day, seriously wtf... Do they even care anymore?  They are rich with a different business model now and well, it's looking grim imo for another HL game honestly. Maybe it's because the expectations are too high and the risk of dissapointing fans is waaaay to high, i don't know.  I think that time-wise the final nail in the coffin will be E3 and this year in general. If we again get no news I'll just forget about it. Who knows though, maybe someday we'll be surprised."
HalfLife,34nnft,Flix1,5,Sat May 2 22:42:26 2015 UTC,Totally agree. I think HL is dead by now in terms of new games. We'll never get a closer I guess ...
HalfLife,34nnft,SummerSoldier,2,Sun May 3 12:14:07 2015 UTC,"gaben has said they've kept quiet to avoid any repeat of HL2s relatively disastrous release (with multiple delays over several years, and huge changes in form between them). they don't want to release anything until they're certain it is representative of a final product which will be coming relatively soon. his exact phrase was that HL3 development has internally been a 'roller-coaster ride' and that releasing random snippets from it would probably be even more infuriating for the fans than the silence we've gotten instead.  i look back at what random little snippets we have gotten and i think maybe he has a good point, depending on how intensively/far any particular branch has been developed. for example we've heard of ASL featuring, to the point that they taught NPCs to sign - if they had shown videos of this, it would become a much more pressing 'where is this feature i can use' rather than the relatively abstract 'neat idea maybe' it is now. same for stuff like the 'return to horror roots' thing that's so popularly recounted."

Not everything is part of some carefully orchestrated plan to build hype.  It's not that we don't want Half-Life 3.  We all do.  But how many times can you allow yourself to be disappointed and snubbed before you realize that, maybe, they just aren't interested right now?

HalfLife,34kvvl,GStanMan,3,Sat May 2 10:47:20 2015 UTC,"I had a feeling a few weeks ago. It was constipation. But a few weeks before that, I had another feeling. I had so much of a feeling that I proceeded to write some news articles about the potential of the big '3' on the horizon of GDC. What we got was Source 2 and an awesome little Portal 2 demo. Valve also stated around this time that they had experimented with a VR demo set in the Half-Life universe. This was arguably the first step we have witnessed towards the continuation of the series.  But even in the light of Source 2, we were disappointed. Everything related to the subject faded back into it's slumber as quickly as it had been riled and we were back again, at square one. Our hopes were raised again a week later, for an 'announcement' was to be made at EGX - but that turned out to be VR related and had nothing to do with Half-Life.  I think the morale here is not to expect anything any more. I will only truly believe when I see it.  As far as we know, Valve are currently trying to find a game to release for their VR devices. It probably won't be Half-Life related as they've expressed discontent about fast-paced games being experienced through a headset. It could be that there is something new and fresh in the works.  As for E3 and PC Gamer's Key Dev conference. If Valve do show up for that, it will be their usual boring ""Yeah, we made Steam."" or ""Yeah, we're doing VR stuff.""  It sucks, I know."
HalfLife,34kvvl,Empty_Allocution,3,Sat May 2 06:52:40 2015 UTC,"I personally think that, with Valve's recent focus on things such as hardware/Steam, Half Life 3 probably won't be announced anytime soon. I'm not saying it won't, it's just that they're mostly focused on other things right now, and Half Life 3 is more of a passion project: something they'd only work on when they really want to.   HL3 probably has a small team already, (as discovered in the JIRA leak) but it's still just not the focus of the company right now, sad as it is. I'm excited to possibly see some Source 2 related stuff at E3, but sadly you really shouldn't expect anything Half Life related. Maybe in 3-5 years or so, but not now."
HalfLife,34kvvl,EpicShot649,2,Sat May 2 15:48:43 2015 UTC,"They say that Half Life 3 is a passion project, but what meaning does that have here? Technically, every project they have is a passion project. Workers are allowed to move between projects. So Dota 2/CS:GO could just as easily be a passion project as Half Life 3."
HalfLife,34kvvl,EpicShot649,2,Sat May 2 16:27:09 2015 UTC,"Well the thing is, they don't need to work on Half Life 3. What I mean is, their other games and software make more money without as much effort, so Half Life 3 isn't as big of a priority as it was back in the day. Of course, this doesn't mean they won't ever make it, but it's just one of those things where they don't have to work on it until they really want to."

Having a count-down timer affords some flexibility in that as they haven't actually said what will happen on Tuesday.  So I don't think it's a chance to pre-order or anything like that - especially because the countdown timer ends at 8:47am (which is the same time (in New Mexico at least) that the mod was released in 2012.)  Expect the full commercial version of Black Mesa excluding Xen with the possibility of beta MP or an announcement for an ETA on MP availability in some form.

HalfLife,34gz66,NigelG,8,Fri May 1 11:13:18 2015 UTC,Pretty sure that it will include that since the steam version main point is Xen and MP. (and workshop support) all of this was said by devs somewhere in the BM forums
HalfLife,34gz66,GasolineFlavoredGum,12,Fri May 1 13:36:25 2015 UTC,"The main point of a Steam release is easy content publishing (which includes updates such as bug fixes and Xen), upgrading to a newer commercial version of the Source Engine (not 2) and getting paid.   all of this was said by devs somewhere in the BM forums   That's not citing a source. I did a teeny bit of googling and found (thanks to The Escapist) this dev post on the BMS forums from the 3rd of Dec 2014 (please note that although she is a VA she is privy to the internal operations of the team):   Please PLEASE please do NOT make any statements about xen folks. We appreciate the dedication and I know everyone is dying for information on it or perhaps a tidbit spoiler of some sort, but Xen projections should all come with a disclaimer.  Guesses turn into assumptions, assumptions turn into facts, and facts turn into broken promises. Yet none of this is done by the dev team. A prime example of this scenario was the ""Release date"" from long ago. While there was only one date we ever offered as a release date, (and to our sadness, we missed that date) all through the web you saw angry people saying we kept missing release date after date after date.  So to be clear:   The existing free mod release is as it stands. While we all know plans can change, we are pretty confident in saying that at this time there are no plans to upgrade or add to the ""mod"" release. The ""retail"" release or Steam version (yes, you will finally get to throw us some change) is is going to have upgrades, bug fixes, a multiplayer addon, and a port to a new engine. That said, because it is a steam version, this also means that any additional fixes or add ons after the initial launch can be done on the fly. No more sending you off to other websites to download patches or upgrade to newer versions. That is the beauty of Steam that we all appreciate. Now regarding the 4 Xen chapters; They are not currently slotted to be included in the mod release or the steam release. You see, it isn't that we are done with it and are just holding onto it for some special occasion or to tease our beloved fans mercilessly. Far from it. It means it is simply not done, and we are unwilling to slate it for any of our release projects at this time.   So until a developer comes along and says there is a release date for Xen, please recognize Xen as a different game all together, and that it will be released when it is done.    Here are some other dev posts you can find by browsing the same thread:   The free version is basically the mod release, ported to a new engine, with some bug fixes. That's mostly it.  The paid version, obviously, gets everything we're doing. That includes MP, constant updates, improved graphics (not just world props; we've got a few new weapon models, animations, particle fx, sounds, to name but a few), new features, active development, workshop, among many other things.       One thing of note: Because we have access to all of VALVe's publicly released games, we can (and have) ripped all sorts of optimizations out from them and ported them into our engine. This is simply not legally possible with the free version.      So until we are explicitly told ""here is Xen"" do not expect to see Xen. Ignore this and you will have only yourself to blame for the disappointment."

First thing is that every minute or so you can hear someone speaking, but the buzz is in the way. To hear it better try to raise frequencies around 1 kHz and lower all others.

Pictures here  Still, if you inspect element of that website and open console, you can see picture of GMan.  One more thing is that recording webpage has 8 code errors.

They were doing it out of the kindness of their hearts to get this released to their fans.

HalfLife,34j1vh,Mageoftheyear,1 point,Tue May 5 06:37:55 2015 UTC,IIRC Longbow is what it sounds like - an archery demo meant to highlight the functionality of the Vive lighthouse tracked controllers.  Did some searching and found this:   Longbow  This was a new internal demo from Valve and was an unexpected treat. The demo involved a longbow and three target objects in an open space. The visual fidelity of the demo itself was very rudimentary however the mechanics were impressive and were a great example of coordinated limbs interaction.  Arrows are grabbed from behind the back in a traditional fashion and a couple of flaming posts are available to ignite the arrow before launching it from the longbow.  I accidentally grabbed the bow with my wrong hand by instinct and so I had to shoot left-handed however I was able to dial in on the targets with good accuracy. I was able to close one eye as I did with the Morpheus castle demo with life-like results. Another fun feature was the addition of balloons that floated up from the targets in to the air that you could shoot at. The accuracy was good enough to make this a very fun challenge.

It's quite insane because you are quite short and you run really fast, at least compared to many other experiences in VR, the height kind of fits you sitting down though. I did all of HL2 with episodes before this so I didn't get any nausea.  I think what made it even more interesting was that I hadn't actually finished the game myself previously, so it was a partial virgin run :3 One reason why I took screenshots in Xen as I hadn't made it there previously. Tourist photos. The other time I tried to finish it I only used quick-save and managed to save myself into a corner, rage-quit, many years ago.  I do want to play all other parts like Opposing Force and Blue Shift... but they have no Source conversion that I know anyway :/ so no VR for those... once VR bitten, it's hard to play games any other way... at least Half-Life hehe.

Not much is known about the actual complete Alpha other than the demo disks found on eBay sometime two-four years ago.   The general gist is that the original ""design and feel"" of Half-Life tapped more into the zany side of horror, trying to embed fear by art style along with the plot and layout of levels. It was eventually scrapped for an unknown reason and the art team took the existing designs, toned them down, and made them realistic."

HalfLife,34dw7o,SidHeartA,32,Thu Apr 30 10:39:16 2015 UTC,"This makes a surprising amount of sense. The sole issue is that the Vortigaunts seem to see Gordon more as their child then anything else; they speak condescendingly to him (to a minor degree), and describe him as having great potential.  ""For a brief time you joined with us. You are one. Between the worlds.""   ""We call you sib, although your mind and meaning are a mystery to us.""   Either way, the Vortigaunts have a significant connection to Gordon."
HalfLife,34dw7o,DuIstalri,11,Thu Apr 30 10:54:24 2015 UTC,"The way I see it they'd be aware he was in stasis, and a lot of their supposed condescension is them guiding and encouraging. They're close with humanity but they're still aliens, it's unlikely they've adapted to our social nuances fully.  Except those two Vortigaunts in the camp near Nova Prospekt, those guys were just total penises."
HalfLife,34dw7o,DuIstalri,9,Thu Apr 30 10:59:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but:    A lot of their supposed condescension is them guiding and encouraging.   That's kind of my point. That's exactly how you would treat a young child who you are trying to raise.  If I remember right about the ones near Nova Prospekt, they were communicating via the Vortessence until Gordon arrived, but apparently that's rude to do around humans, so they just started speaking with a vocal language after that."

HalfLife,34dw7o,BCWFiction,11,Thu Apr 30 11:48:22 2015 UTC,"That comment by Gabe is so interesting, I never heard it before. I think the Vortigaunts being the ""children"" seems to make sense, or maybe humans/the resistance (inc. Vortigaunts) in general?   Can you remember the reasoning people had for the ""children"" being Alyx? If anything, she seemed one of the least swayed by the whole messianic following of Gordon, so unlikely in my mind to be considered one of his ""children"". Unless the phrase does literally refer to all of humanity/the resistance."
HalfLife,34dw7o,BCWFiction,8,Thu Apr 30 11:12:59 2015 UTC,"I think people just figured ""Growing Romance + Suppression Fields Down = Babies!"" and used that equation to see Alyx as the potential for Gordon's children. When I say that it all just seems like reaching, and overly literal."
HalfLife,34dw7o,galient5,9,Thu Apr 30 11:20:21 2015 UTC,"Ha, that seems fairly obvious now. I agree with you. And I feel like we've already had the whole Alyx-close-to-death thing in Episode Two.  I feel like Valve are better storytellers than to pull that card again so soon."

HalfLife,34dw7o,Lepaz14,8,Thu Apr 30 15:11:48 2015 UTC,"Actually...I've been expecting the Vortigaunts to end up betraying Gordon the second the Combine fall. The All-Knowing Vortigaunt states that forgiveness isn't something they do, and the G-Man is quick to  remind you that their first experience of Gordon is a crowbar to the face. Not to mention their interference - helping Gordon? Or, more likely, skipping out on a bill?"
HalfLife,34dw7o,Trenchman,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:35:26 2015 UTC,"I feel the forgiveness quote is directed towards the Combine, not Gordon.  They were enslaved during HL1 so I doubt its something personal.  Plus, Gordon did pretty much save them singlehandedly."
HalfLife,34dw7o,_______No_______,9,Fri Jul 3 09:12:02 2015 UTC,"While the interview was indeed about Half-Life, that particular answer I think was more generalized - I think the question was simply ""what are players' biggest fears"" in general. But I think those principles were heavily considered and applied to EP3, otherwise Gabe would not have brought them up.  Fading of one's abilities - well, we know for a fact Gordon was to wear a winter parka over his HEV suit due to the Arctic cold and so maybe this was to be something of an in-game mechanic as well. There's a few other ideas that could work along this line: the Advisors' psychic powers; the HEV potentially malfunctioning, and so on.  Death of one's children... well, children are dependents. In a sense, everyone in the game world is dependent on Freeman. He's set everyone free, he's saved the world, he's liberated the Vorts from eons in servitude and he's inspired the Resistance. So right off the bat, one can assume that there was to be more death in EP3, more... failure, especially for the Resistance and the oppressed citizens of the world. Maybe Gordon's victory wasn't going to be as easy as in past installments. Maybe he wasn't even meant to win.   These are all questions we won't ever get an answer to until the damned thing gets on our hard-drives and data miners decrypt the living daylights out of it."
HalfLife,34dw7o,koopcl,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:11:45 2015 UTC,"With the arctic part, I think that they should use the cold mechanic from the original game in the freezer room, and maybe have certain fires or heat lamps be small areas of shelter"

I personally don't believe they will do that.  They might however make VR the best way to play it, but playing on a Monitor would still work just fine.  Also I can think of no reason that anything that can be played in a VR headset couldn't be played on a monitor.  Basically a headset is just two monitors with head tracking.  Replace the head tracking with mouse movements and send the video from one or both screens to a monitor.  If they tried to release HL3 as VR only the mod community would have a monitor/mouse mod for it within minutes."

HalfLife,34eui6,Chwana,26,Thu Apr 30 15:49:24 2015 UTC,"1) Black Mesa Source releases this Fall with a greatly expanded Xen part full of queer little recurrences of threes (similar to the EOTL video), and an eery feel of something being off, mysterious characters and events we've never seen or heard from before or since who seem to be part of some entirely other plot. The game still comes to its established conclusion and nothing firm is said but it's pretty clear to savvy fans that there's time fuckery afoot, and this is building to HL3.  2) Weeks to a month later the Aperture Science VR demo as part of a collection of free small VR demos for Vive. Have an incredibly obtuse and difficult, well buried puzzle in it, requiring huge community action to solve (basically the same idea as Silent Hills P.T., RIP). On completion it unlocks not just a brief teaser video revealing bizarre quasi-celebrity partnerships, but a greatly expanded continuation of the game, that ends with a splash/title-screen confirmation of ""Portal 3"". That fades out like flourescent lights powering down, flickers pops and sparks, the ""3"" fading last and briefly turning to red/pink/orange that flourescent lights get when they're frozen. 'Very Soon' fades in.  3) Internet goes batshit. Valve Time jokes abound, and some thick people and/or trolls insist 'lol Portal 3 not Half-Life you're all gonna be so disappoint' but the general atmosphere is very ""YES."" The very next day there is a massive update to BMS, and now there is a way to enter some code attained from the Aperture Science VR demo puzzle which changes Xen completely, to where it is now entirely under uncontested Aperture Science control, there is a new title sequence after teleporting there which reveals this is the ""Portal 3"". Glados comes and addresses us personally, makes some jokes about keeping us waiting, and kills us. HL3 available for preload."

ANTARCTICA  The Antarctica continent is one frosty piece of shit, so it's hella cold.  Cold? Ice.  Ice is heavily connected to Episode 3 as it's believed to be set in a snow-filled country.  Country?  Somalia.  Somalia has guns out in the open to buy.  Buying guns?  Counter-Strike.  Counter-Strike is a GoldSrc game.  GoldSrc is the engine used to create Half-Life 1.  Half-Life 2 is the sequel to Half-Life 1.  And what's the sequel to Half-Life 2.  You know it.  Episode 1.  It opens with Gordon in an explosion on some towers.  Explosions and Towers?  9/11  Godzilla.   Godzilla destroys towers with his atomic breath, which causes them to explode.  Atomic?  Nuclear.  Nuclear?  Nukes.  A nuke was used by the black ops team to destroy Black Mesa in opposing force.  Opposing?  The opposite of what I'm saying here logical."

I wanted two syllables, like Freeman. I wanted a name that was also something with literal word meaning (like ""Freeman""). [Brian] Martel and I had been talking about Pulp Fiction again and there's the Sam Jackson character's bible quote about the Shepard and that word was sort of floating around in my mind at the time.

HalfLife,34945h,SidHeartA,30,Wed Apr 29 07:34:43 2015 UTC,I always thought they kinda new about him. It seemed like everybody knew something you didn't. Eli obviously knows about him. You see Odessa talking to him before you arrive at the checkpoint. It almost seems like the gman is telling those people to help Gordon along his journey. At least that's what I always thought.
HalfLife,34945h,CombineOverwatch,10,Wed Apr 29 13:25:46 2015 UTC,I've always thought that about Odessa. He immediately offers you a rocket launcher upon arrival...

HalfLife,34945h,splocket2233,12,Thu Apr 30 01:36:08 2015 UTC,"Remember how that same Vortigaunt says ""We serve the same mystery.""? I don't think any character in the game knows the whole story with the G-Man. The Vortigaunts know something for sure, suggested by their ability to stop the G-Man from putting Gordon into stasis. Eli knew something as did Dr. Breen and everyone else who ever encountered him. The problem is that no one is sharing this information with anyone else. They're to preoccupied fighting the imminent threat of the Combine to actually dedicate time and organize on this issue.   That being said, I think the Vortigaunts know far more than anyone else. Why they're not sharing this information with anyone is anyone's guess. I suspect they have an ulterior motive that requires humanity being kept in the dark or they don't trust humanity with this information."
HalfLife,34945h,RagingNachos,5,Wed Apr 29 13:45:02 2015 UTC,"This doesn't have much to do with your tl;dr, but I always saw G-man as very similar to the character of the judge in Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian. This elusive, mysterious figure, obviously powerful and influential in ways you can't know about, and if not a malevolent force, definitely somewhere in the grey area of morality.  I think there's just something about characters like that, the ones that seem to know more about everything than you do, that really makes you want to know more about them. It's like they are holders of the great secrets of their worlds. And you know they could tell you so much, but they never would.   Seeing those glimpses of G-man throughout HL2 was a really strange, mysterious experience for me. I always got an uneasy feeling thinking about him following me, operating behind the scenes, pushing his unknown agendas. Yet another example of Half Life's amazing character writing, like having a protagonist that doesn't speak."
HalfLife,34945h,BCWFiction,3,Wed Apr 29 14:46:05 2015 UTC,That's a really interesting analysis. What makes the g-man such an amazing character is that we have no idea of his identity or of his motives. Revealing too much about him would only detriment his mystique.  Good one for brining up the the judge. Blood Meridian is one of my favorite books and the judge's actions are both awesome and terrifying at the same time.
HalfLife,34945h,Volkov07,2,Thu Apr 30 02:57:20 2015 UTC,"Definitely. No idea of who he's working for, what his aims are. What always made the judge so intriguing to me was that he would constantly disappear and return with no explanation, he had information that none of the others could possibly have, and he seemed impervious to harm. Like he was some kind of God. It's been a while since I've read the book, one of my favourites too, but I always remember the judge as standing out by far the most vividly in my memory.  I'm wondering what they'll do with G-man as the story progresses, though. I could see Valve, for the sake of completeness, revealing G-man's motives/superiors/secrets, and while it would be interesting, the fact that we don't know any of those things about him is such a large part of his character. Beyond the lilting voice, awkward turns of phrase, random appearances etc., it's all that we don't know about him - and want to - that gives his character depth. It's going to be interesting either way."
HalfLife,34945h,BCWFiction,3,Thu Apr 30 11:06:35 2015 UTC,"I've thought a lot about it, and I think Valve will find a way to tell G-man's story (probably not directly) and keep it completely unique and unexpected, even after all these years. Hell, they'll probably manage to make him even more.. uncomfortable (I think that's the word I want) in the process."
HalfLife,34945h,BCWFiction,2,Thu Apr 30 11:16:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I'd be impressed if they did, and let's be honest, if anyone could do it, it's the people who came up with G-man in the first place. But part of me wonders what would happen if they never fully explained him, whether that might be the best thing. Part of his whole mythos is the not-knowing about him. Taking that away, learning everything about him, would he still be the same character?"
HalfLife,34945h,Mr_honesty_,2,Thu Apr 30 11:27:59 2015 UTC,"Well we don't need to know everything about him. His motivations and a clue as to why he's got those reality bending powers would be enough. We learned what the Nihilanth's motivations were when we became aware of the Combine and I still find him to be an incredibly intriguing character, even awe-inspiring."

HalfLife,346nwy,teuast,21,Tue Apr 28 19:56:56 2015 UTC,"thats not.. exactly 100% true. While I think Valve was aiming for something specific and worth while, they did it in a way that raised some valid (and some not so valid) concerns with their customers and/or the modding scene. Not every one was following the hate train simply because it was there but because some people really did have valid concerns with the feature for one reason or another and enough people had those valid concerns to be really upset to the point where Valve had to reverse what was put in place.          Honestly I think just about every one made the right call here. Valve and community all have the right puzzle pieces, we just havent put them together properly yet."
HalfLife,346nwy,u83rmensch,6,Wed Apr 29 01:43:57 2015 UTC,"I was seeing an extremely gratifying amount of people saying that they liked the idea but had problems with the implementation.

The consensus seemed to be that if it was restructured, it could be really popular, and I really hope that message got through to Gabe if they decide to have another go at it."
HalfLife,346nwy,I_Eat_Pups,2,Wed Apr 29 10:29:19 2015 UTC,"yeah. one of my friends was kinda on that ""fuck them"" train (although he doesnt reddit).

Explained to him that funding modders is what valve had in mind, problems is they displayed it in a manner that seemed more like a greedy cash grab and less of a beneficial service with useful value."
HalfLife,346nwy,bbpgrs,5,Wed Apr 29 12:28:09 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day Valve is a business and a business' aim is to ultimately make money, and it really shows that Valve don't plan to screw there customers in the process when they removed the feature.  Another company may of just shrugged there shoulders and left it as it is. But I'll admit I had big concerns when it all started and the  urge to jump on the hate train can be very strong on Reddit."

It just needs to be done right.  Valve should start iterating with Half-Life series mods.

Also, you really can't look at the Skyrim situation in a vacuum and pretend it doesn't affect us, if only indirectly.  Valve clearly wants to embrace a future where paid mods are an everyday thing.

HalfLife,347xit,Personal_Person,5,Wed Apr 29 01:26:45 2015 UTC,"iirc, he doesn't even have a name. He's called g-man because he has a suit and carries a briefcase so it's supposed to be a government man, but even the name is just speculation"
HalfLife,347xit,Brunoob,5,Wed Apr 29 05:52:33 2015 UTC,"G-man is a nickname used for him by the developers actually, later it was found out (by file diving and or messing with the dev console) and also used by the community."
HalfLife,347xit,MuffinAlibaba,2,Wed Apr 29 10:41:22 2015 UTC,Adrian Shepherd calls him G-Man in his journal.  That's where the name originated.
HalfLife,347xit,antrlaucius,3,Wed Apr 29 12:03:21 2015 UTC,"I'm 99% sure the model and texture names reffer to him as gman. (The model and console were available before the Gearbox games were made, so) He calls him a G-man because that's what he looked like to him."

HalfLife,347ii2,Westerhalts,1 point,Sat May 2 16:13:12 2015 UTC,"My thought process was imagining Valve's E3 conference when things are wrapping up, GabeN saying his thankyous and shit, and just before he leaves the stage he says, ""Oh yeah, and one last thing..."". GabeN leaves as the lights are going down, and then this plays. Maybe it's just me but that would be perfect."
HalfLife,342x2m,Ultimate_Cabooser,10,Mon Apr 27 21:55:23 2015 UTC,I voted Gordon Freeman for Smash. Take a stand.
HalfLife,342x2m,Gondile,5,Mon Apr 27 21:59:54 2015 UTC,Pretty much impossible since Valve has no relation towards Nintendo whatsoever. Anyone who's been in SSB has been on a Nintendo console at least once.
HalfLife,342x2m,Gondile,7,Mon Apr 27 22:34:51 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I read that Nintendo stated that even third party characters were very eligible.  Not that it matters, since Gordon has absolutely no chance whatsoever."
HalfLife,342x2m,Gondile,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:08:51 2015 UTC,But doesn't third party just mean they're not owned by Nintendo?  I'm talking about characters that have specifically been on one or more of the Nintendo systems.

HalfLife,342x2m,BunkBuy,2,Tue Apr 28 02:19:57 2015 UTC,I voted more than one character because fuck the system. Gordon is one of the chars I voted.
HalfLife,342x2m,Professor_Hoover,2,Wed Apr 29 10:52:50 2015 UTC,"the 357 and spas 12 would have to be removed because nintendo doesn't allow guns, so they need to be replaced with A. gluon gun B. gauss gun C. hornet gun D. RPG or E. Grenades"
HalfLife,342x2m,BunkBuy,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:09:29 2015 UTC,"Well, there's almost a 0% chance Gordon would ever be in the game anyway. The point of this was just me feeling creative."

I have a question for you. How could you have thrown it all away? It staggers the mind. A community of modders, with the ability to sway reactionary and fearful minds toward the truth, choosing instead to embark on a path of ignorance and decay. Make no mistake, modders. This is not a revolution you have sparked...this is death and finality."

HalfLife,33yizn,Scydow,7,Mon Apr 27 13:32:45 2015 UTC,I actually tried that!  I had issues trying to figure it out since I haven't done much with Source since before the Steam Pipe/SDK 2013 updates.  Modding isn't as streamlined as it used to be — go figure.
HalfLife,33yizn,B-24J-Liberator,42,Mon Apr 27 21:50:04 2015 UTC,It's about time. We should have done this five years ago once they failed to deliver episode three
HalfLife,33yizn,trakmiro,50,Tue Apr 28 00:53:29 2015 UTC,"I've been pretty forgiving about HL3 — not so anymore.  I get that ""these things take time"", but playing mind games with your fan base isn't cool.  I don't know why they haven't released another Half-Life.  Artistic integrity?  Bigger fish to fry?  Laziness?  But I do know that they need to be open about at least where they're going.  I don't give a shit if it's ""more confusing if they talked about it.""  Just answer the damn question:  Are you working on it or not?  And what direction are you heading in?  I fear that when and if we do see it, it's going to be nothing like what we wanted.  The last game Valve released without outsourcing was Portal 2!  CS:GO and DoTA have both had help from outside studios.  It's very obvious Valve only cares to release games when they need to fill a gap somewhere.  It's no coincidence CS:GO and DoTA 2 came out right as eSports got popular."
HalfLife,33yizn,ExtraCheesyPie,22,Sun Apr 26 22:59:05 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I even want it anymore. I'm starting to get pretty cynical about the whole thing, and you know 8 fucking years waiting for a shred of news will do that to you.  They're really gonna have to shake it up. Half Life 2 and its episodes had a lot of ""wow"" moments, and while it was from Gordon's perspective, I felt like sometimes Gordon didn't have a very good perspective. Sure it was cool to see the bridge collapse with the trains at the beginning of episode 2, but it was so far away and I could do the exact same thing in GMOD really easily, just set off some dynamite and break a couple beams. It began to boil down to Barney's joke about ""throwing that switch and all"" where I'm basically running to the next room, shooting/throwing barrels at some not particularly smart opponents that mostly stand still or strafe a bit, then hitting a button so Alyx can do something cool. I get that Gordon has no personality or voice so we can sort of fill-in-the-blank with how he feels about everything or what his character would be like, but why not let him have a little bit more agency in the world? So far I feel like he's the catalyst that causes neat things to happen to people around him."
HalfLife,33yizn,green_smoke_dewritos,6,Sun Apr 26 22:07:59 2015 UTC,"What would you want Gordon to do then?  The buttons and puzzles are just a way to slow down the action and get the player to explore.  I agree, the HL2 AI is a bit dated.  But I don't want it to be super-realistic.  They're just cannon fodder so it isn't like you want them to be too hard.  The AI can actually do some pretty smart things, but the environment or Gordon killing them often prevents it from happening."
HalfLife,33yizn,ExtraCheesyPie,8,Sun Apr 26 23:04:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, hl1 soldier ai was a lot better because they would fucking move and at least react to you quicker. Hl2 soldiers would start running and die mid run because they ignore you for 4 seconds."
HalfLife,33yizn,pdrocker1,2,Mon Apr 27 02:15:30 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing when I started replaying HL1 a while ago. The reason the combine feel so dumb is because they're slower and they tend to stand still while the player is constantly moving around.  When you're fighting marines, they run faster and it almost seems like they're trying to stay out of your sights. They move kind of like the player does, which makes the fights feel faster-paced. Their movement speeds makes it easier for them to flank you. Also, it might just be me but it feels like they're way more liberal with grenades."
HalfLife,33yizn,FrozenCaveMoose,3,Mon Apr 27 02:27:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seems they are. I wish HL2 soldiers would pick up nades and throw them back or something, they're just too cannon-foddery."
HalfLife,33yizn,monkeysrule123,3,Mon Apr 27 11:18:52 2015 UTC,"The the Combine soldiers are like ""oh, look, a guy in a orange suit... oh, that's gordon freeman... I guess I should move to cov-"" (shotgun blast)"

I swear that they even, at great distance, duck and cover from my crossbow. It's as if they were super-up HL1 marines with various high-levels of difficulty, spanning various species, that are all intelligently hunting me.   ..."
HalfLife,33yizn,Ultimate_Cabooser,-1,Mon Apr 27 19:41:45 2015 UTC,Correct me if im wrong but gabe has said before that half life is done for now and they have no current plans to go back.

HalfLife,33yizn,monkeysrule123,-7,Mon Apr 27 03:36:41 2015 UTC,Maybe just accept the fact that its not coming back. There will be no episode 3. Ever since they originally said it wasn't being made they have given cryptic answers basically saying its not coming. There wont be a half life 3. What have they even said to lead you to believe that there may be one
HalfLife,33yizn,Ultimate_Cabooser,7,Mon Apr 27 04:50:57 2015 UTC,I never said anything like that. I was just explaining to the guy why we're pissed.  He was saying we're entitled and should wait. Pretty contradicting if you're saying there's nothing to wait for in his defense.

HalfLife,33yizn,dakoslug,3,Mon Apr 27 05:49:07 2015 UTC,"That always strikes me as a bullshit argument when it comes to something serialized for which there is no reason for them not to continue it (i.e. cancellation). I mean, we've had all of Mass Effect, all of Assassin's Creed, all of the new generation of CoD since Episode 2 ended on that fucking cliffhanger. How much freaking time do they need to make a game I'll play through twice and then get bored every time I try starting again?  It's like, if GRRM stopped writing ASOIAF, deciding he would just never finish or release Winds of Winter, but was endlessly cryptic about the fact, would you bitch at his fans for being entitled that he's not finishing it?  I just want Valve to finish their fucking game so I don't need to pay attention to them anymore. Steam is great and all, but I wouldn't give two shits about GabeN if it weren't for Half Life 2, the Episodes and the endless cockteasing that has followed."
HalfLife,33yizn,ReiBob,2,Mon Apr 27 19:47:38 2015 UTC,This makes no sense. Am I the only one calling bullshit on this statement?

HalfLife,33yizn,noxbl,13,Mon Apr 27 19:32:02 2015 UTC,"I don't hate him either.  But what's frustrating me is that I think Valve is really losing a sense of who they are.  They used to make games, not hats, not entertainment ""services.""  I get it.  More money.    But it's like they're only interested in appealing to the lowest common denominator by doing as little work as possible.  I miss the Valve that always had something new in the works, like circa 2007 Valve.  Now we'd be lucky to get any sort of new Valve game.  I honestly have kind of given up on HL3.  I was really being optimistic up until a few days ago.  Even all the talk Gabe gave in that interview a few weeks ago just made me think that it's simply a project that's slipped through the cracks.  I don't think so anymore.  I think it got shelved at one point, intentionally or intentionally, and it hasn't been worked on in quite awhile.  That has to be why Gabe gets so nervous when it's bought up.  So he just bullshits some excuse about how they're learning from their other products and some other thing.  It's clear to me now that Valve is done making games that we buy and never do anything with again.  Every game that's launched post Portal 2 has been some kind of service.  CS:GO is designed to be around for awhile.  DoTA 2 was designed to be around for awhile.  Although he does followup the interview with that infamous quote, ""that doesn't necessarily mean what people are worried it might mean"", I don't think it means that they're still working on it.  I think that's precisely why they aren't working on HL3.  It doesn't fit with their current goals as a company anymore so they've canned it until they feel like working on it again.  I hope the community stays strong for much longer than just a week.  Valve lost a lot of respect in these past few days.  They need a good kick in the ass to get them doing cool shit again, rather than doing what earns them a steady income."

HalfLife,33yizn,galient5,2,Mon Apr 27 02:21:03 2015 UTC,Why do you say all this when 1) source 2 hasn't been released yet and 2) we have screenshots of source 2 versions of games? They always make new games with new engines. Maybe they postponed any new games since they were then working on source 2.
HalfLife,33yizn,Every_Geth,0,Mon Apr 27 02:32:16 2015 UTC,"Because it's clear where their priorities lie.  They can make more money off of a few ""service"" games a la DoTA or TF2 and Steam than they ever would off of HL3 or something similar.  The way Gabe stumbles in interviews whenever Half-Life is brought up tells me it's more than just ""we're working on it.""  Either it's a Half-Life we never asked for, or it isn't anything concrete."
HalfLife,33yizn,galient5,2,Mon Apr 27 03:04:29 2015 UTC,"Like asking dre to stop making headphones and release detox, the money from that new venture is too good. I have more or less accepted that I will never see half-life 3 OR detox."
HalfLife,33yizn,Tankbot85,2,Mon Apr 27 08:39:48 2015 UTC,I must say I lost a lot of respect of him after the AMA. He simply dodged all the critical questions.
HalfLife,33yizn,B-24J-Liberator,9,Mon Apr 27 16:07:40 2015 UTC,"Did you read the AMA? It was more or less positively received and, if anything, postponed the dismantling of his statue. Even though the tone was bitter and angry, a lot of people seemed to respect that he came out and talked to the fans (or ex-fans?) directly, rather than just putting out a statement or something like that."
HalfLife,33yizn,calamormine,21,Mon Apr 27 07:19:50 2015 UTC,"Not really, the impression I got was ""we understand you're unhappy. We are sorry you feel this way. Still, we ain't changing shit."""
HalfLife,33yizn,monkeysrule123,6,Mon Apr 27 11:50:34 2015 UTC,I meant that the fans were bitter and angry.
HalfLife,33yizn,superkickstart,6,Sun Apr 26 23:37:27 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you did not really read the whole AMA.

HalfLife,33yizn,galient5,2,Mon Apr 27 01:13:41 2015 UTC,"But that was literally his stated intention with the AMA. It was in the title! Obviously he's not going to change course on a business decision days after the fact, he wanted the good/bad/ugly straight from the community's mouth, and people were petulant. Oh well, let's see what they do with the reaction they got."
HalfLife,33yizn,AbigailLilac,7,Mon Apr 27 16:22:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah just because he gave answers they dont like, doesn't mean it was bad. This gif has you think he was torn to pieces when he basically said I'm sorry you disagree with our business and we will work on making everyone happy."

HalfLife,33yizn,galient5,6,Mon Apr 27 04:59:55 2015 UTC,"That guys words are as empty as he says Gabe Newell's words are. It's not difficult to make something sincere sound insincere. I'm not saying that Gabe Newell was being sincere, but that guy's post said absolutely nothing. It's important not to do a 180 because of what he said, as his words don't warrant that. However, we can be a little less mad because of what he said, and that is important. People are mad, and objectivity is suffering. People are being irrational and they are not looking at the issue in an objective way. We need the community to calm down a bit before we can really look at this issue."

HalfLife,33yizn,ReiBob,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:13:16 2015 UTC,I enjoyed most of his replys. I might not agree with some but he seemed honest.  But there was a huge bad reaction. Most people(like one the dudes who replied to you) are just puting words in his mouth and pissed off that Gaben didn't say ''We understand you're unhappy. We are sorry and we're going to change everything acording to what you want''
HalfLife,33yizn,Dain42,2,Mon Apr 27 08:03:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, everyone is being incredibly irrational right now, and we're going to have to wait for everyone to calm down before we see people's real feelings on the subject."
HalfLife,33yizn,ReiBob,2,Mon Apr 27 19:24:23 2015 UTC,Exactly. /r/pcmasterrace is the most hilarious on this.  They went from sucking Gabens toes to hate him more than the holocaust.
HalfLife,33yizn,crowbahr,1 point,Mon Apr 27 11:30:33 2015 UTC,"Considering the source of their name and their creepy fondness for upvoting lightly modified Nazi imagery, I'm not so convinced that's the most apt comparison...  * Not saying they're Nazis, obviously.

HalfLife,33yizn,scribbledown2876,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:18:31 2015 UTC,"There's not a good way to really determine how people feel, overall, and how negative the reaction is in terms of the size of the user-base and community on Steam. People who are upset are much more likely to speak up and speak up more vociferously than people who like me whose response is more nuanced and muted. And it especially leaves out the likely horde of people who don't actually care one whit.  I mean, I can see why people are a bit wary of paid mods from a support and completeness-of-product standpoint. I can also see why people think that the balance of payments is out of whack.  I cannot, however, really see the standpoint of people who think that the distributor and original creator of the game should get nothing. And I really find the whole thing about how mods should always be free of cost as some sort of philosophical stand* to be the most transparent of covers for, ""I want free stuff,"" in most cases. I mean, really! Even the FOSS community, noted for its numerous rabid devotes of the Free Software philosophy, doesn't hold people to that standard.    * The words ""philosophical stand"" seem overly generous, here, but they're the best I've got."
HalfLife,33yizn,staffell,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:56:29 2015 UTC,Very well said.
HalfLife,33yizn,zombiefriend,2,Mon Apr 27 21:05:31 2015 UTC,I honestly don't see what the big deal is. I've read endless vitriol and dissenting opinions on paid mods but in the end all it does is allow a revenue stream for those who want it. Free mods are still free if the modder wants it to be so. If the modder wants money though he/she can make it.   The %'s need to change but I don't see 30% as unreasonable by valve: it's what they're taking on the community markets after all. The issue is the original company charging exorbitant rates for 0 work. Valve at least hosts everything a has to provide community curators.   As for the arguments that all the mods will be cheap ripoffs of each other always trying to undercut or take someone's free mods and charge for them: it's absurd to think it'll be so easy to get away with. Everyone seems to ignore how well the various markets avoid copyrighted content and create new content for the games.   I'm not jumping on the bandwagon. I see this as Valve trying out a new way to encourage talent to make money in a new day and age of gaming.

HalfLife,3417ha,TrippEvans,16,Mon Apr 27 14:31:37 2015 UTC,Might wanna split this up into multiple paragraphs.
HalfLife,3417ha,PsychicExtremist,3,Mon Apr 27 14:53:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm gonna do that once I get home, but I typed all of this on my phone, and It was lagging so much I cant even think about opening that again til I'm at a computer. Sorry its so hard on the eyes!"
HalfLife,3417ha,AQ90,3,Mon Apr 27 15:02:25 2015 UTC,"Whoa whoa whoa!!   The Borealis was accidentally teleported to the arctic circle with dry dock and all Man-heck no! No teleporters and/or helicopter ride, if it's in the arctic then are we gonna be staring at the sky in movement for about a little less than 2 weeks?(Unless we get some sorta cut scene thing) Because that chopper is in White Forest which is in Europe. Eli IS dead, not only has Valve confirmed this, but Gman warned Eli with the unforeseen consequences line Alyx relayed to him.   But, anyways, GG OP, just get some proof into the pudding! :)  P.S. I'd like HL3 to go in like this: Starting out on a half as reliable train heading towards a ghost town in which mossmans base was located..... Strider shoots the train derailing it and leaving you and Alyx for dead."
HalfLife,3417ha,ceraex,3,Mon Apr 27 23:31:03 2015 UTC,"Lol, another train ride to begin the sequel. It would only be fitting. Another objection I had to OP's story was Alyx's willingness to come along, since I would suspect that she would be too traumatized to go along unless she adopts an ""I must avenge my father"" mentality, which would get pretty annoying."
HalfLife,3417ha,AQ90,3,Tue Apr 28 11:39:55 2015 UTC,"She HAS to come along, if not then why should Gordon go?   Just to get the stuff in the Borealis? He'd be out numbered in the amount of combine, not to mention the Advisors.   She wants to literally rekt the combine race because of her father dying.  Plus, Alyx must have some info on the Borealis, remember that she had a talk with her dad after she relayed unforeseen consequences line."
HalfLife,3417ha,ceraex,0,Tue Apr 28 16:36:37 2015 UTC,She doesn't have to. And I wouldn't expect her to. She's not that headstrong—just look at the stalker cart scene. Then her father dies? And any information that Alyx has about the Borealis can be given to him before he leaves or via radio transmission when he's in the arctic.
HalfLife,3417ha,AQ90,1 point,Wed Apr 29 06:00:04 2015 UTC,"Well, keep in mind, after the whole bit with the hunters as soon as she was able to stand she wanted to fight by your side again. She seems horrified when you see the hunters the second time in episode 2, so I'd expect shed still want to fight with you, but probably be pretty distressed around advisors"
HalfLife,3417ha,AQ90,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:03:00 2015 UTC,"What about Gordon? He has been through The Black Mesa Incident, through the Uprising, and through many things that would disturb anyone. He needs motivation from a supporting character.  Wouldn't YOU want Alyx to come along for a ride?"
HalfLife,341ld5,ReiBob,17,Mon Apr 27 16:17:04 2015 UTC,"Like I said, paid mods have nothing to do with Half-Life. This isn't /r/valve, /r/steam, /r/pcgaming, /r/pcmasterrace, this is /r/halflife.

HalfLife,341ld5,unsubinator,-3,Mon Apr 27 16:45:06 2015 UTC,"So the opinion of a guy that made money from modding Valve games is in no way relatable to sub where we discuss Valve games?

They act like Steam is dead and Gabe Newell is solely behind this 'hrroble plan'. It staggers the mind that these kiddies believe that free modding is dead, or that valve takes 90% of profit. Garry was spot on with this."
HalfLife,341ld5,HalfLife1MasterRace,3,Mon Apr 27 16:23:44 2015 UTC,"It will probably make the Steam Workshop filled with shitware to the point of uselessness, a la the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, but as long as Nexus Mods and sites like that are still there, hopefully the modding scene as a whole won't suffer too much.  Even if it does make the Workship unusably shitty, of course, Valve won't do anything about it, because as long as they're making more than $0 from it, they're coming out on top. So all this means for me, the end user, is that I'll probably stop using the Workshop entirely. So not the end of the world for me, by any means. Valve themselves won't even notice. But it does weaken Steam as an all-in-one platform for PC gaming. Which, again, is fine, because there will (hopefully) always be alternatives when you want mods.  I mean, if Bethesda made it impossible to install Elder Scrolls VI mods except through the Workshop, the only real consequence is likely that I'd never buy an Elder Scrolls game again, since there's no point playing an ES game without mods, unless you like tedious, half-broken games for some reason. But again, not the end of the world.  So while my initial reaction to this was fairly strong, I'm now mostly over it."

HalfLife,33zu00,Vrabo,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:51:50 2015 UTC,"I doubt they will abandon the story they were telling, but who knows.  Original mods are much more interesting than telling a story set in the same universe as the base game. Total Conversion mods that is."

HalfLife,33zu00,Splatterh0use,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:43:52 2015 UTC,That's different. Black Mesa improves the storyline that already exists in the way of better graphics.
HalfLife,33zu00,Lightningstar95,2,Mon Apr 27 16:27:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think any sane modding group would want to approach a project from the standpoint of ""We're going to tell the next chapter of Half-Life.""  That sounds pretty arrogant, don't you think?  Not only would you become obsolete if Half-Life 3 happened, but there are so many stories you could tell, why limit yourself to that one?  That said, I've often felt that if Valve had no intention of continuing the game in the near future, opening it up to the fans in some formalized way wouldn't be the worst idea in the world.  It's really the fans that have kept this series alive in the first place.  A wise man would find a way to harness that talent, rather than ignore it."

HalfLife,33uxi2,Becer,33,Sat Apr 25 21:36:21 2015 UTC,"For those who don't want to sift through all the comments:   Gabe claimed he was flying back from somewhere Thursday.  Friday, he was visiting an eye surgeon.  Then he realized he had over 3,000 emails (I honestly thought it would have been more) and figured he pissed off the Internet.  He could just be playing dumb, but who the hell knows?  He's a busy man. He keeps throwing around that they're ""data driven"" and will respond accordingly; his AMA is a part of analyzing the data.  He's more or less said that the ""data"" in this case is how consumers vote with their wallet. He believes that incentivizing modders will make better products:  ""Working at Waffle House does not help you make a better game."" Whenever he was asked about a donate button, he didn't give a direct answer.  The most he commented on was that they're adding a ""pay what you want button"" which starts at zero, and is set by modders. He'll look into the banning of accounts; he believes it's stupid and doesn't solve anything.  He even went as far as to look into someone's account ban personally. The game publisher sets the share taken.  So if Bethesda/Zenimax wants 45%, Valve gets their standard 30%, and leaves the mod creator with 25%. He was asked about forcing mod creators to use Steam (or making it so they would only want to).  He said that they have never, and don't plan on having any way of forcing developers to use Steam.  He said they don't have a problem telling them that they're being stupid if they are.  Whatever gets someone the most exposure is fine with him. Any other comments are basically a variation of one of the above.   What we can take away is that he's very adamant on Valve remaining laissez-faire in this situation.  They provide tools to shape the experience, nothing else.  They aren't forcing anyone to sell their mod.  It's simply an alternate form of modding that they see potential bennefits for the moders (and obviously Valve) in.  The capitalist/wannabe businessman in me agrees with him.  No one is forcing anyone to do anything.  It's up to the consumer to decide what is worth paying for.  Yes, it's very shitty that tons of mods have decided to cash out, but the only thing objectively that's changed is the amount of control mod authors have.  The ones that have abused said control are indeed paying for it with the backlash.  I think he's a man who wants his business to make money and for his collaborators to make money."
HalfLife,33uxi2,bothanspy1337,7,Sun Apr 26 01:19:16 2015 UTC,"I'm curious how they figure that the ""You must make $100 profit before you see any of it"" rule is fair to the vast majority of modders.  That's an aspect that gets overlooked.  Market dilution alone makes that a tough hurdle to overcome for small mods, which means that the majority of the money will go straight to Valve/Bethesda, not to the modders they claim they are supporting.  I get the rationale that bank fees and such, not to mention taxes, make the process unfeasible at lower dollar amounts, but people conduct smaller transactions on eBay all the time.  A minimum $100 of personal profit seems quite high to me when you consider that Valve and Bethesda's cut is enormous.  If you charged $1 for your item, you'd need to sell it to 400 users before you saw any profit from it.  That means Valve and Bethesda get to split $300 before sharing any of it with you, which is far more than the cost of their individual games in the first place.  To be clear, this is not entirely Valve's fault.  As I understand it, Valve's 30% share isn't unusual for them.  Valve is bearing the brunt of a storm that's made worse by Bethesda being quite greedy.  Moving forward, it will be interesting to see how other publishers respond.  Hopefully, we'll find that Bethesda is an outlier."
HalfLife,33uxi2,Riomaki,7,Sun Apr 26 03:21:16 2015 UTC,You must make $100 profit before you see any of it   I think it stops people from making a few shit mods that take like half an hour in the hope that a few people will buy because of a low price. It kind of means that people will have to put time into their mods so that they don't get stuck in the sub $100 zone.
HalfLife,33uxi2,galient5,3,Sun Apr 26 09:26:13 2015 UTC,"I think Google's ad sharing revenue operates similarly, you need to hit a certain amount before you get your cut.   Smaller traders on eBay accept these charges because liquidity is a big issue to them and turning a profit quickly can make or break them, but for a big business like Valve and Google liquidity really isn't the issue."

HalfLife,33uvzb,lambdageneration,4,Sat Apr 25 21:22:13 2015 UTC,"This was the first I had heard about the $100 minimum before the creator sees a cent.  Basically, for Skyrim mods, Valve and Bethesda share a 75% cut from your work.  We knew that.  Valve's 30% cut is also apparently typical of everything on Steam, which means that Bethesda is really to blame for taking a ludicrous cut.  What's new to me is that you don't see any of this until you've made $100.  And that's not $100 in gross sales, that's $100 to you.  So a $1 item would need to sell 400 copies.  Obviously, most things aren't going to sell nearly that much, so it winds up being a ton of free money for the publishers.  And anything that is successful means they'll make a few hundred dollars off your creation before you saw a dime, more than the cost of the game itself.  I realize that such things aren't atypical.  I think on the Ouya microconsole, for example, you have to move several hundred dollars worth of product before you get paid.  But it just strikes me as really disingenuous of Valve and Bethesda to try to spin this as ""Now you can support your favorite modders!"""
HalfLife,33w2v2,FearReaper9,18,Sun Apr 26 04:33:16 2015 UTC,"Here goes...   You killed specialists, known as HECU (Hazardous Environment Combat Unit, a United States Marine Corps special forces unit) and black ops (it's never explicitly stated which branch of the government they operate under), that were sent in to quell the Black Mesa Incident. A large part of their plan included killing every innocent, unarmed scientist in the facility so that they could never tell the outside world what happened that day. They're not exactly the good guys here. Valve put a tremendous amount of effort into making Half-Life 2 as good as it is, so yes, they probably wanted to show off their hard work whenever possible. This is a great point that I'm not sure how to address. Here is a good theory (thanks, /u/TheScyphozoa). If this theory is true, the G-man probably hypnotized the people involved with the HEV suit's arrival and continued presence (Barney, Alyx and Kleiner) so that they wouldn't question it. Alternatively, it's possible they went along with the plan voluntarily, since they knew Gordon would return someday and figured that working with an anonymous shadow agent to help Gordon save humanity when he returned was an acceptable price. That's just the result of Gordon's time at MIT. Come to Massachusetts and we'll show you how it's done. Do you mean ""can"", because if you do, isn't it obvious? Back in the day, Valve was experimenting with these things called ""episodes"" - essentially games shorter than full titles that they could pump out at a faster rate. They had originally planned to create an Episode Three to conclude the trilogy of episodes, but after Episode Two debuted, they abandoned the episodic format in favor of a full-length Half-Life 3 game. That's part of why it's taking so long to finish the damned thing and conclude the storyline.   Also, I don't really understand the point you make about not judging a story until it's been completely finished. Why can't certain elements of a story stand on their own as solid ideas without needing to tie in with the conclusion?"
HalfLife,33w2v2,TehMWF,11,Sun Apr 26 05:49:42 2015 UTC,"I'd also like to point out that many praise Gordon (mainly Vorts) because he killed the Nihilanth. As for normal humans that praise Gordon, well, stories can get stretched.   Gordon was the center of the Black Mesa Incident so it's no doubt that they might have pegged him as the hero in the whole mess of the story. Most people don't know what Gordon's final surviving days at Black Mesa were. They know that he was just a simple worker in the Anti-Mass Spectrometer and the orders he followed caused the whole thing. Beyond that they probably heard of him launching the missile and defeating Nihilanth, things that make sense to be praised.  Gordon was an unstoppable force, so when he shows up 20 years later and everyone knew how unstoppable he is and they knew that Gordon was on their side, I can imagine that they'd be like, well shit, we got this on lock.   I don't think they praise him in the beginning, I think they're so happy that they have someone like him on their side because he's an unstoppable force. I mean, he's a legend. The man in the orange suit who caused it all, launched the missile, killed Nihilanth, then disappeared forever....until 20 years later. I'd be excited to see Gordon. That's like meeting a legend."
HalfLife,33w2v2,nihilinth,1 point,Sun Apr 26 06:56:21 2015 UTC,"If you are going to say you like something, but you haven't seen the ending/experienced the ending, you haven't fully experienced it yet, and the ending could completely change the ideas behind certain moments, etc. Therefor, completely deciding if you like it or not before you've seen the ending is not something you should do. You can say ""you like it up to this point"", but most people don't make that clarification. Anyways, I'm just going to go on and look at the list:   Yeah, but that still doesn't explain how everyone can see him as the good guy when he did slaughter hundreds. Double standards I guess (I think this needs a little bit of clarification, so if you need me to clarify I will). Still, it doesn't really help. Almost everything in these games are there for a certain point, like Portal (1 & 2). They don't just halt you're progress in the story to go ""ooohhh look at the pretty portals"". Sure, there are moments where you are supposed to try out the new playthings (like the ""ooze""), but they are normally either quick and easy or just as challenging as the rest of the game. In HL2, it just feels out of place to go from riding in a jet-boat-thing and then be halted so you can open a gate. Yeah, I can see that.  I feel like everything you said here was a joke, due to a lack of an actual answer. Yeah, this was something else entirely. I apologize. I don't even know what game that was from, or why I attribute it to Half Life... well anyways, it has been removed. I'm once again thinking this was a joke answer.

HalfLife,33w2v2,ChampionOfMeridia,9,Sun Apr 26 08:44:44 2015 UTC,"On your first point, the citizens don't hail Gordon as a saviour until after you assault Nova prospekt, with the exceptions of the people who knew him from Black mesa.

Depending on how canon you believe Opposing Force is, they sent in the Special Ops to kill the HECU.  As a result, no one would have heard about it.  The scientists, being on Gordon's side, would have looked the other way.  Now, how that gets Freeman to messiah-like proportions, I'll never understand.  It doesn't really happen in HL1, where you are treated as a lackey, but in HL2, everyone praises you.  To me, it's a less-than-subtle design strategy to make the player feel good, which we see through now. There are many places in HL2 where the physics engine is very ""look at me!""  At the time, it was a big deal, so they wanted to show it off.  Today, you're right, a lot of it is unwelcome busy work.  Particularly in Sandtraps. As others said, the theory is that G-Man somehow gave it to Kleiner.  Not confirmed in-game, however. I'm not sure that's meant to be taken literally.  Most FPS games didn't have iron-sights back then.  If HL were made today, it might.  But you could also argue that it's a game pacing choice.  HL is very much a run-and-gun shooter and iron-sights have the tendency to slow things down.  Imagine if, in Doom, you had to pause and zoom on every enemy if you wanted to hit them, or else you'd never hit them.  It would get really obnoxious. He can.  The real question is, how does Freeman quickly climb ladders with both hands on a gun? ;) Because they don't want to?   Half-Life, as a series, is anything but flawless.  Most people who play it go through the stages of treating it like an infallible masterpiece, but over time, the varnish wears thin.  I think real fans can and should acknowledge that the game has its shortcomings, but it's still a great game, especially in light of how military shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield destroyed the market for games like it.  Since Half-Life, how many FPSes are truly like Half-Life's unique blend of single player shooting, puzzling and exploration?  I can name them on one hand.

In the case of the iron sights: It's a video game, while it has many realistic aspects its main goal is to engage the player, coupled with half life's level design and the (harmless) tradition taken from the first game, having iron sights would slow down gameplay and detract from the appeal of the gunplay."
HalfLife,33w2v2,TrippEvans,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:57:34 2015 UTC,"That's like saying ""what are the odds that the main character of The Titanic would have such an interesting story?"" Its a movie, so he's the main character so it can stay entertaining. Gordon works the way he does so that half life can stay entertaining"
HalfLife,33w2v2,TrippEvans,2,Thu Apr 30 14:10:24 2015 UTC,"As for #4 I remember seeing a self-post about his training.  Here's the link.   Due to the nature of the HEV suit, (having reactive high-impact armor, vitals monitoring, self-administrating drugs, and a system that can be used to manage items and ammunition count) the hazard suit is classified as military equipment under US law. Unfortunately Black Mesa cannot shake this classification off even if the suit is used exclusively for scientific purposes. US law also dictates that military equipment has to be used by a military operator and a military operator is described as someone with military training. Which means that Gordon can be a military operator without be in the military simply by virtue of having some military training at the end of each Hazard Course. So it turns out that Gordon receives this training not because he intends to use it, but only to meet the requirements that the US government set up."
HalfLife,33w2v2,Sandvich18,-5,Sun Apr 26 21:52:46 2015 UTC,"Even in the military they are taught to aim their gun to be accurate. Gordon just picks up a gun and instantly knows how to operate it, etc. Same with the alien weapons."
HalfLife,33w2v2,TrippEvans,4,Sun Apr 26 23:32:04 2015 UTC,"In that case it's time to break the fourth wall.  How fun would Half-Life be if you could only use one or two weapons, and even with those you couldn't reliably hit anything that isn't five inches from your face?"
HalfLife,33w2v2,AQ90,-7,Mon Apr 27 01:42:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, it would most likely add another layer of depth. It would also be pretty innovative for it's time, seeing as how only a few FPS games at the time actually let you do those things. With Half Life I never felt like I was actually about to die... I always had enough ammo, and if I didn't I always had spare guns I never use except for when I'm out of ammo for my good guns. Seriously, it was only really challenging during the boss battles."
HalfLife,33w2v2,green_smoke_dewritos,6,Mon Apr 27 03:04:07 2015 UTC,"Sure, it would be super innovative in a call of duty: black ops kind of way. But valve was innovating on fun, and plot, and immersion. Trust me, picking up a gun and relying on the players skill to use it is way more immersive than picking up a gun and relying on the protagonists ability to use it."
HalfLife,33w2v2,percolatorfish,-3,Mon Apr 27 15:15:20 2015 UTC,"If they truly wanted immersion, then they would have explained it. Immersion is where you feel like you are in the game, right? The entire reason Freeman doesn't talk is because he is supposed to be a blank slate for more immersion. So, explain how he is able to do it and you will feel more in-the world."
HalfLife,33w2v2,percolatorfish,2,Mon Apr 27 21:27:33 2015 UTC,"If this is your first time playing an fps, than whether you can ads (aim down sights) or not, you're going to suck at shooting. So if half life is your first fps, than you're gonna be a shitty shot like any normal scientist would be, but if you've played tons of fps' it would make since that when you're in that world, your training will carry over. Remember, its you and your training helping you, not Gordon and his lack of training"

Like focusing on better options for modders, for example: a larger cut of the revenue (25% is pathetic), removing the $100 minimum for authors to receive money, and having a ""Pay What You Want"" option.   You can also ask for improvements for players like: quality control on paid mods, transparency on who your money will go to (% to Valve, publisher, and modder), and maybe better curation (things like modpacks and publisher reviews?).   Just some ideas. I think the request to remove paid mods is hopeless and counter productive, it'd be better to focus our efforts towards movements to improve the modding system and even other subpar systems in Steam like Greenlight."

HalfLife,33r6f2,Riomaki,3,Sat Apr 25 07:43:49 2015 UTC,"It's really a shame how Valve had, at one point, seemingly wrangled a lot of outside talent to do Episodes, and then threw it all away because of indecision.  We had Warren Spector, who is a legend in the industry for his work on Deus Ex and other games.  We had Arkane Studios, which went on to do Dishonored and swipe away HL2's art designer.  Talk about wasted opportunities.  In hindsight, it would have been so much smarter to take the HL1 approach and do Episodes that tell another side of the existing story, rather than try to tell the next chapter of the story."

I have leverage my game experience the way I want it to be and thanks to all these great tool who make what PCgaming is today. Fun fact I become good enough at 2 of these field to make money out of it because of Valve in the first place. Valve is a company that do things differently. They know what to do with content creation. There are plenty of company who don't know what to do with content creation and failed miserably, so I much rather on the side of valve from my part. I'm still amazed what we can do with all these tools and games.  The paid mods news is certainly debatable. What is not the huge cut Bethesda/Valve make out of paid mods.  IMO I'm happy to have a pay what you want option and I have always dream to support the team behind Black Mesa Source for example. So like with normal games I'll test out the mods and then pay for them if I feel like it. Just like I do with the music platform Bandcamp hopefully."
HalfLife,33neoy,SkullMasher,1 point,Fri Apr 24 09:31:50 2015 UTC,No one is forcing the mod creators to charge. They are just giving them the option to charge for more they put hard work into. I think it's fair to give people the creators a choice.

There are great minds behind the people at Valve and their professional friends, but if they are not making HL3 or another single player game I expect they will spend their time (and money) on other great things. Now that Steam is an almost completely autonomous community driven entity they can polish that (and this whole mod buying) and release more multi player games.  Just my musings."

And again, you can look back on things like the problems Steampipe created like the save stutter and giant props blinking in and out of existence.  Really, where was the ""We don't release things until they're perfect"" in that?  They broke it and have left it broken for over a year now.  I mean, say what you will about Bungie and Microsoft.

HalfLife,33pkdz,BoomCandy,8,Fri Apr 24 17:19:45 2015 UTC,"I agree. In general, Valve has not been acting like the consumer friendly company they are known for. With games like CS:GO, for example, there are a ton of fixes that Valve has yet to make. Yet with many of their subsequent updates, they have simply releasing more cosmetic items. Same goes for TF2 and Dota 2. Valve just is no longer proactive in providing a good consumer experience anymore. I don't know if this is because they are pooling a ton of their resources into the Steam Machine and thus don't have the time, or if they simply just don't care anymore, but they haven't done much in terms of giving people what they want. My hopes for Half Life 3, as well as my hopes for Valve to be as consumer friendly as they once was, is slowly dwindling."

I'm not all ""OH!  We're getting HL3 tomorrow!"", but to think Valve just won't make any more games forever is kind of stupid.  Sure, it isn't as big of a priority anymore, but if the internal projects in there are constantly fluid, someone is going to want to work on HL3 eventually.  My thinking is that it's been abandoned and started up again by various people.  It's clear they don't want to make games unless it brings something new to the table, and it's clear that most of the people there either work on maintaining games or on other stuff.  So I think it's extremely easy to see how it's gotten lost in the breeze.  I think all of the comments about doing something retro mostly had to do with them not wanting to produce HL2 with Source 2 graphics.  When and if it happens, they probably want HL3 to be as different as HL2 was to HL1."

HalfLife,33pkdz,Sitruckram,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:32:00 2015 UTC,"Kind of.  Can Valve justify spending a couple of years and millions of dollars to create a game that might not live up to the hype, especially when their revenue streams are already in place?  There's really no real competition for Valve in the content delivery/gaming infrastructure/game marketplace realm on PC.  There's Origin and UPlay, which aren't anywhere close.  Apple actually has pretty ugly competition in the mobile hardware market.  Also, Apple is expected to make new shit all the time.  They are a publicly traded technology firm, have millions of shareholders to appease on a daily basis, and are known for paradigm-shifting technological advances that belittles what Valve did for the FPS genre (although cool).  At the end of the day, nothing is at stake if Valve doesn't release HL3.  I really want it to happen, but I wouldn't want them to do it because they felt pressured.  So, no, it's not like if Apple decided to not make new versions of their hardware.  It's more like if Bethesda decided to not release another Wolfenstein game.    If Apple flat-out stopped making new hardware revisions, forced obsolescence, and stopped making things better, their business would crumble.  If Valve flat-out didn't make HL3, the company would still exist, and would ultimately still be as profitable as they already are."

HalfLife,33ow8r,TheJonesReddit,26,Fri Apr 24 08:15:58 2015 UTC,"How Valve should fix this:   Mods are all free again. All mods have a donation button. On donations made, 60% goes to the mod creator and 40% is split either 20/20 or 30/10 between the game dev and Valve.   What Valve have chosen to do will, if widely implemented, drastically damage the Workshop. It's greedy of both Valve and the game devs, the latter of whom have already been paid for the content in the base game, let's not forget. Unscrupulous mod developers will make low quality content with clickbaity titles and saturate the market with it if they think doing so is a surefire way to get money - keeping donation the basis of income will keep mod quality high, depending on passion for a game rather than greed. And people won't donate if most of their donation doesn't go to the mod developer.   Following this recommendation, the Workshop could be a gateway to supporting mod developers, as well as throwing game devs a stick and bringing some extra cash into Valve to cover the costs of hosting the mod content. What they are doing is like outsourcing to a sweatshop - more money perhaps, but bad for everyone involved."
HalfLife,33ow8r,thecritic06,4,Fri Apr 24 14:16:59 2015 UTC,"I think we have less to worry about, since Half-Life never got any kind of Steam Workshop support.

It's not specifically game related, but look at services like Patreon where people support online content creators on a regular basis with the presumption that they will get quality content in return. Then there's the research that suggests that pirates (who got media content without paying for it to begin with) spend more on gigs and merchandise, resulting in more money to artists? The Workshop could combine these tendencies for the better, and cause a revolution in the way mods are distributed. Instead they've gone with an awful reactionary, microtransactionesque tactic."

HalfLife,33ow8r,bothanspy1337,2,Fri Apr 24 16:45:10 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call them EA.  They're a different shitty beast all together.  EA's faults came mainly from broken/rushed games, and the excessive pushing of DLC to the point of making their products suffer.  Valve swept under the rug and caught everyone in their net, only to begin exploiting us later.  Tyler makes a good point in that they're pretty much done with standalone games with a single service.  Every product they release is now a service (hence the reason why they only release a game when there's a gap to fill in the market).  I have very mixed feeling on the whole ordeal.  On one hand, I'm a firm believer in a free market (not totally but you get the idea), and if the customer and the provider are both happy, then who am I to complain?  If I don't like paying for mods, then I won't pay for mods.  On the other hand, Valve has been the role model for how gaming should be done in the eyes of the PC gamer.  So if they're going out of control, then who do we look up to?  I've always felt very comfortable with them because they never gave me much of a reason to be angry with them.    But is it that all really a facade?  What if Gabe is really only the way he is on camera because it sells products — for the record, I don't believe that, but it certainly is hard not to question, right?  We all could just be overreacting and maybe we just need time to get used to the idea and hopefully Valve will work with us to make both parties happy.  I don't hate them.  I'm just done with them right now.  They did some awesome stuff at one point, but the constant product pushing is numbing me — speaking of which, it's almost Saturday.  So that means I should be getting one or two promotional games in my library soon!  It's a shame. Steam is a great service on many different platforms, and Steam VR is still probably my HMD of choice.  But it just sucks that they way they money-gouge and the way other companies money-gouge are different.  EA'e behavior was nothing out of the ordinary in the big picture.  Eventually, people had enough of them so it stopped.  But Valve's strategy?  They advertise everything they do as ""for the community"", so everyone just excepts it and moves on.  And then they basically have a pseudo-monopoly on their hands, so who are they competing with?  People say they'll leave them for Origin, but they won't.  Steam is the better service.  It just sucks Valve is so shitty at running it."
HalfLife,33ow8r,zenolijo,3,Fri Apr 24 23:02:16 2015 UTC,"My opinion:  The mod work is made by the mod creator alone, and noone else. Even though the game developer didn't directly earn any money from implementing Workshop before, they did indirectly because it was a huge selling point for many games such as Skyrim and Cities: Skylines.  The only reason it would be a good idea to implement paid mods on workshop would be to increase the quality of the mods on the workshop. But lets be realistic here, noone would even try to earn a living to do it for 25% unless it was some really awesome mod that improved the whole gameplay a game for a decent price. And even for a mod like that, the time you spend on creating a mod that you're not even sure will sell well, it's a huge risk.  The revenue would have to be at least 50%, preferably somewhere around 70% or mods will be even less worth their money than tf2 hats and cs:go weapons for the consumers, and the modders won't earn much either.  Also, alot of small simple mods like custom gmod models and such will probably start costing 1$, which will be very annoying."
HalfLife,33ow8r,Riomaki,3,Fri Apr 24 15:44:58 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I don't know what a fair split is, but it's not like Valve and other devs didn't already turn a profit off the work of modders.  We help to keep their games in the public eye for all these years without any reward while they reaped the extended sales from it.  In Valve's case, we've had to endure years of their ""deal with it"" attitude, breaking the SDK time and again, making things a PITA to use.  Now, they're saying we can make money, but they want an enormous, majority cut for themselves?  How can I not scoff at that?  It's ridiculous."

Maybe it's our fault for constantly propping them up over the years, maybe it got to their head, but I would hope all the backlash is going to hurt them so they know not to try this shit again.   As a side thought, what the hell happened? The last new IP valve released that wasn't a mod originally was what? Alien Swarm? L4d2? Dota, and TF2 and CS:GO are good games, but they just feel like perpetual wheels of income to be greased every now and then with balance updates, more skins to buy, gimped drop rates and economy changes that discourage trading(or down right limit it for months) and as of recent, half assed pay to win dota 2 events. Dota events have been, inconsequential to the game for a while now. CSGO operations are cool, and I haven't followed recent TF2 updates but some friends said EOTL was a let down. What happened? Where are the great single player experiences we know and love? There were talks a few months ago about how valve was going to have custom games in dota 2 be available for purchase as well, when those get released. Which again is fine, if they're good and worthwhile but not while the revenue split is so tragically terrible. Where are the games, as VNN mentioned, those games a re services, perpetual Multiplayer experiences to be played consistently over time, but where are the games, the Half life's the Portals, the new IP's. What the hell is going on? Valve doesn't answer to shareholders, there's not boardroom of directors asking for financial reports, so what's the deal? Surely the money can't be blinding them this hard, surely the money can't be discouraging them from being innovative in an industry that's so iterative it hurts to watch E3 every year.  tl;dr, I'm listening to triage at dawn and wondering where the new good games went. what happened to people trying to outdo each other not iterate on each others business practices, and game design."
HalfLife,33ow8r,War_Dyn27,2,Fri Apr 24 17:02:49 2015 UTC,"Left 4 Dead was the last Valve IP that wasn't a mod (Alien Swarm was a mod for one of the Unreal Tournament games). And even then it was a game being worked on by Turtle Rock Studios, Valve took interest and hired everyone. Portal before that was based on a student project called Narbacular Drop whose team were hired by Valve.  More importantly:  Taken from the Steam Workshop Agreement   Revenue Share for Paid Distribution of Contributions. If your Contribution is distributed for a fee (whether in-Application or via the Steam Workshop), you may be entitled to receive a portion of the Adjusted Gross Revenue (as defined below) that is collected for the Contribution. The percentage of Adjusted Gross Revenue that you are entitled to receive will be determined by the developer/publisher of the Application associated with the Workshop to which you have submitted your Contribution (“Publisher”), and will be described on the applicable Workshop page. Valve will remit payment of any revenue share to which you are entitled in accordance with directions from the applicable Publisher, and in accordance with Valve’s payment procedures. Generally, payment is made thirty (30) days from the end of the calendar month in which the Adjusted Gross Revenue was received. For reasons of fraud protection, no payment is made earlier than ninety (90) days after the initial copy of a Contribution is distributed. For available payment methods and associated minimum transfer amounts, please see the FAQ page.   So it seems it's Bethesda are the ones who decided that the modders get 25%. I am sure they get a substantial cut of that 75% too:   When an item is sold via the Steam Workshop, revenue is shared between Valve (for transaction costs, fraud, bandwidth & hosting costs, building & supporting the Steam platform), the game developer (for creation of the game and the game's universe, the marketing to build an audience, the included assets, and any included modding or editing tools), and the item creator (including any specified contributors).  The percentage of revenue an item creator receives from direct sales of their item in this Workshop is 25%, as stipulated in the Supplemental Workshop Terms. Your individual share may be smaller if you have added other contributors that share in the royalty payments.   Another interesting thing, is the 'Service Providers' system, where modders can allocate a percentage of Valves cut to certain organisations as a donation. For Skyrim these include Blender, the free 3D modelling software, Nexus Mods and several others."

HalfLife,33mwt4,Dr_Tower,8,Fri Apr 24 00:36:44 2015 UTC,"Yo. Sorry I took so long to get back to you, I saw your comment and was like ""I'm gonna reply to that"" and then I had to leave for a midterm, then go downtown to pick up some monitor cables, then I accidentally made a joke over dinner around someone I shouldn't have made it around and spent the rest of the evening complaining about overly sensitive people to my roommate and cleaning the water off my jacket.  I can sort of see a rationale behind it. If you're a modder and you're putting a lot of time and effort into something for free, then that's great. But here's a thing: take Estranged. That's one guy's project. It's a really good mod, a really cool story, interesting setting, good voice acting, promises of lots of intrigue and twists and turns along the way. But that guy has to pay the bills, and not by making Estranged, so yeah, he's still working on it, but it's taking a long-ass time. If it was possible for him to make money by making Estranged, then he'd be able to put more time and energy into the project. That's the sort of situation where everybody wins.  But the thing is, this is probably the worst implementation of this idea anybody possibly could have come up with. I spent literally two minutes on my way to my midterm thinking about how they could have done it better and I came up with some vast improvements that would take virtually no effort.  You know Bandcamp? That's the website where I first saw the pay-what-you-want model getting serious use. I haven't made a lot of money from it, but I've made a bit, and I've actually had more people pay me more than I asked than just pay the minimum or download my songs for free. Now, they already have it set up so that creators can set it to pay-what-you-want, but it doesn't work as well on Steam as it does on Bandcamp, because Steam is far more populated by braying kids who'll buy shitty Foxy and Rainbow Dash reskins for everything with their parents' money than Bandcamp is, so my first thought is to make it a donation model. Everything is still free, but you can pay the creator if you want to. The number of people who played Estranged, a lot of them would have gladly put up a couple bucks, five, ten, or more for that game. Minerva would have make Adam Foster a killing even if it hadn't gotten him his Valve gig. And the twit who made it so you could play Skyrim as Pinkie Pie probably doesn't get anything either, because kids aren't smart enough to type in a donation number. Valve either takes a very small cut or none at all. They're already rolling in cash, what are they going to do with more, hire more support staff? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  So anyway, that's my two cents on the matter, which I contributed here instead of to the Gordon-born Skyrim mod.  TLDR Donations!"

There's not a chance in hell of Valve doing this sort of thing without Bethesda's go-ahead (whether they approached Bethesda with this idea or vice versa, I don't have a clue, but my money's more on the latter), and while the 25% of profits going to the modder is frankly pathetic, I seriously doubt the entire 75% of the rest goes to Valve for just being the ones distributing it. Bethesda's probably getting the lion's share of that money, considering it is their game. (Not to say that Valve's getting zilch from this, of course.)  Granted, this could just be some desperate attempt on my part to rationalize this all away, and Valve could just be a money-hungry company, simple as that. I'd like to think they're better than that, but, well."

HalfLife,33ntwh,binOsbi,8,Fri Apr 24 01:13:14 2015 UTC,"I'm the author of a trilogy of some pretty popular maps for source.  The time I spent on those maps was monumental and whilst I appreciate all the support and feedback I've been given over the years, I would be lying if I said I didn't mind not making anything from it.  There are two types of modding.   The first type is the kind of shit you have fun with. For example's sake: ""Here's a dildo sword for Dragonborn. It took me two days to make."" This is the kind of silly crap that took zero time investment. This would be the equivalent of me creating a new map and filling it with silly shit like car traps and exploding Breen busts. (I actually do this, it's called creative development.) Why on earth would you put a price tag on that? People will though.  The other type is dedicated modding. Another example: Somebody spends a year making an entire armour set for Dragonborn. He's drawn it, planned it, modelled it, lovingly textured it. Spent weeks on it perfecting it before releasing it. He makes nothing, but is modest so he never mentions it. Meanwhile he is working and raising his family, eager to move into the games industry but for what ever reason can't, despite the skill he has proven he has.  That second guy is kind of like me. Blood sweat and tears went into my creations because I love them and I love creating that content and watching people run through it on Youtube and listening to the comments and helping others with similar projects etc.  So say I released my last map for a pound\dollar. I'd be 7 grand richer now - assuming Valve take nothing out of that payment (Which they probably do, I haven't read into it yet) - but keeping that assumption, a dollar for each of my maps over the time they have been release would net me 37 thousand dollars/pounds over the course of four years. That's my family, my kids, that's my house, that's my well-being and more importantly that is me creating more content for the playerbase, making a bigger impression on the community.  Shit, I'd be working on gm_ghosthunt_whiteforest and Hartley Asylum right now If I didn't have to pack my shit and go to work in five minutes.  TL;DR - Passion for development and time spent should have an impact on how much you sell your item for but you can't measure such a thing accurately. I can see the system being abused but also understand the perks and rewards as I am a long time mapper with popular releases and understand effort and love people put into their creations. The best way to handle this would be to make everything pay what you want and then trust the community to reward exceptional work."

We consider ourselves to be in the same category as a lot of amazing games on Steam which started out as mods, such as Killing Floor, Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, etc. In that regards I would say this whole paying for mods thing, actually bears very little relevance to us specifically, because an extremely tiny percentage of the mods in question could really be sold as a standalone retail title. Our offer to become retail came a long time before this wider discussion started, in addition.  The other key difference in this whole discussion is the concept of scope, which Empty_Allocution talked about. The scope of the mods which are currently available on the Skyrim workshop are fairly limited, in that they're effectively content packages for an existing game. Sometimes they're huge and encompassing content packages, but they're content packages nonetheless. That's not meant as a put down in any way, I absolutely adore mods for the Elder Scrolls and Fallout. Black Mesa never really was like that, much like Counter-Strike, Killing Floor, Team Fortress, etc. They were really their own thing, built on an existing engine base, kind of like Nehrim.  Black Mesa has been developed by a team of 40 people over 10 years, and for the past 2 years we have poured our hearts and souls into the project, with the knowledge that we are going retail. I think with regards to asking for people to pay for it, that's a significantly different story to a few guys working on a Skyrim mod over 6 months. Again, that is in no way intended to be a put down on the incredible work done by the passionate and fantastic Skyrim modding community - just a fundamental scope and execution difference.  Those are my current thoughts on that particular subject. Just another note, your first bullet point about why we're not on Steam is incorrect. We are not doing anything with Source 2, nor are we waiting to finish Xen to get BMS on Steam. Xen remains a ways off. The simple, honest reason is that these things take a lot of time, especially for a team of passionate amateurs with real lives and jobs outside of developing the game, and the whole process of engine porting and improving what we already had has been inordinately time consuming and painful. Expect things to get exciting relatively soon, though!"

HalfLife,33jt4c,Riomaki,10,Fri Apr 24 00:01:24 2015 UTC,"Some of these can easily be countered:  ""It won't meet expectations, so they won't make it"" If Valve likes what they produce/are producing then that's all that really matters. I don't think they look at games (games specifically, not including steam) as a way to create commercial success anyways; other studios churn out games regularly to keep money flowing in, Valve releases games when they want to.  ""Gamers don't care"" I don't think Valve cares if HL3 would compete with annual titles like COD or Assassin's Creed. They know there are fans and that's all that matters.   ""Valve doesn't make games"" Honestly, if Valve wanted to focus solely on Steam and not on games we would have heard something. Also, DOTA2 isn't that old.  Valve releases games when they feel like they've met their own expectations, and let's be fair, Valve sets higher standards for themselves than the majority of their audience. A good portion of gamers are thrilled to get the next annual installment of CoD or Battlefield and don't seem to care about the level of quality so long as it's something new to play. Valve cares far more about giving gamers a very unique and well crafted experience, something that people will remember for years. People still talk about Half-Life 1 and 2, which is something that can't be said about a LOT of games of similar age; the reason being that Valve didn't give players the bare minimum, they gave us games that surpassed our expectations. Half-Life 3 could have come out in 2007 if Valve didn't give a shit, and it likely still would have been a good game, but Valve isn't happy with ""good enough."" So I'm willing to sit back and wait for Valve to make a game because I know they're going to take the time to make something amazing."

But, in my opinion, they've fallen short of perfection in the past and it hasn't bothered them enough to address it, despite having the means and capacity to do so.

HalfLife,33ny05,TheScyphozoa,1 point,Sat Apr 25 00:03:57 2015 UTC,"What I meant was,in terms of the argument, what they make is irrelevant because there is such a huge variety of mods (Not just maps, which for some reason you kept bringing up :P), there's no point in bringing up a specific type (like maps), since the mod will be priced based on what its worth.   Sorry if my wording was confusing."
HalfLife,33ny05,TheScyphozoa,1 point,Sat Apr 25 00:31:34 2015 UTC,"Because maps are, from what I've seen, the most common ""general category"" type of mod over-all. And, you can't really say it will. Some people will want a ridiculous amount of money for their mods, others simply want a few cents now and then. They will not ""be priced what they are worth,"" and you'd be hard pressed to find someone who has created something and can unbiased to judge it. They're either too critical of themselves, or too lenient.   And, the market may (read: probably) get flooded by teenagers making complete garbage, just like gmod. Now, though, they want paid for it."
HalfLife,33ny05,TheScyphozoa,1 point,Sat Apr 25 01:45:03 2015 UTC,"Also, what I said as an example of how much each party would get was just something I quickly thought of. At the very least, I think the creator's should at least 35-40%, and the rest 55-60% could be, at the very least, halved between the two. I think you're underestimating how much around a fourth would be for valve, it'd build up."
HalfLife,33ny05,doublicon,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:31:22 2015 UTC,"I don't really think so. For a mod like the ones I've seen, 5 seems to be the most I'd pay for if I had the game. Hell, you can get 5 full-fledged games for that price sometimes.  So, let's say the average mod is, oh, I don't know, $3.00. With 55-60 percent to the creator, that's $1.65 per sale to the creator, and $0.675 to Valve and Bathesda, respectively. That's ridiculous, considering that you can't predict how much money the mod will make. For a $20.00 game, I would agree. But not for a mod.  As I said before, if it were a full fledged game (or a mod, like Black Mesa), I would whole-heartedly support this pay system. Hell, I'd support the creators getting up to 90% even, because something like that takes a hell of a lot more work, and deserves to be treated as its own game, and does not belong with the shitty mods.  If your mod can hold its own, try for a greenlight."

Now, they are arguably the most dangerous of the Combine human forces.  That's probably also why they got a different coat of paint when Valve did Episode One, so you can see and shoot them before they close in.  Generally, Shotgunners will only open fire once they get relatively close to you.  So, don't let them.  If you see a Shotgunner barreling at you, start backpedaling as fast as possible, returning fire as you go.  Mappers should use them judiciously, never more than 1-2 at a time, and always when the player has a chance to see them coming.  Just think of how nasty they were when they didn't have the red eyes!"

HalfLife,33hoop,JubeyJubster,8,Wed Apr 22 20:55:47 2015 UTC,"Shotgunners are the real terror of the Combine. Figuratively and literally. Nothing is scarier then walking down a corridor, when a shotgunner comes charging down it.  These were meant to be ""closer"" enemies. They were meant to break the strategy of just hiding under cover and popping up. Instead, they will charge your fortification, and when they get to you, you maybe have a split second to react until you are dead.  Shotgunners are beings of evil in Hard mode. If they get close to you, consider yourself dead. Your ass will be grass in less then two seconds if you let them close in on you.  So, how do you fight these beast?  Well, the Shotgunner has a very bad weakness, his range. Shotgunners will almost NEVER shoot from farther then a room away. You need to backpedal like crazy and get them out in the open. If you know one is nearby, throw a grenade. I don't believe they follow grenade spacing rules and ignore grenades, making them easy to take out with them.  TL;DR: Backpedal and kill them from a distance. Do not use cover to kill them, they will close in on you. If they do, it's over."

An Engine such as Unity would go a long way in getting rid of the initial obstacles and issues from what I understand.

HalfLife,33cn97,The_Brian_Davis,11,Tue Apr 21 14:37:45 2015 UTC,Not only that but it took time for the military to organize a response to the situation. The opening of Opposing Force has marines coming in on Osprey so that suggest the military was not stationed there in the facility. I have no idea what the military response time would be for an event like this though.
HalfLife,33cn97,nihilinth,6,Tue Apr 21 15:23:37 2015 UTC,I think I heard they were training in Arizona. Depending where Black Mesa is in New Mexico it wouldn't take long to fly over.
HalfLife,33cn97,The_Brian_Davis,8,Tue Apr 21 15:51:20 2015 UTC,probably more than 30 minutes though. I guess if we go by game play it takes like 30 minutes to get topside where the military is so around an hour? Hurray Speculation!
HalfLife,33cn97,ZeekySantos,7,Tue Apr 21 16:13:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it takes quite some time for Gordon to get to the surface and first encounter the military. That time span could easily have been their response time. We can't factor this into Gordon's little nap then."

HalfLife,33cn97,DeadeyeDuncan,14,Tue Apr 21 22:36:01 2015 UTC,He was unconscious? I just assumed that he lost a bit of time  when he was transported to xen briefly.
HalfLife,33cn97,camtheredditor,6,Tue Apr 21 17:52:57 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure in Black Mesa you kinda have a getting up animation to imply he was unconscious.
HalfLife,33cn97,Surfing_magic_carpet,2,Wed Apr 22 02:10:41 2015 UTC,"In HL they implied it in other ways with the heavy breathing and black screen, too. I kinda assumed he was knocked out because of that at least."
HalfLife,33cn97,Xeotroid,11,Thu Apr 23 05:10:10 2015 UTC,"I always thought it were mere minutes, if he was lying there for an hour, he would probably be crushed by falling ceiling."
HalfLife,33cn97,eugd,6,Tue Apr 21 20:09:55 2015 UTC,moments or minutes
HalfLife,33cn97,Surfing_magic_carpet,2,Tue Apr 21 15:08:03 2015 UTC,"TL;DR probably a couple hours at best, a couple days at most  Well, I think the question you're looking to ask is ""How much time passed between inserting the specimen and when Gordon leaves the test chamber?"" I think there are gameplay and storytelling reasons why it seems like a short amount of time, but realistically speaking Gordon was probably gone for at least a few hours. IIRC, in Raising the Bar, it's said that the complete series of events in HL1 take place in about a weeks time, so we have a rough idea of how long certain events take. Also, keep in mind that, for storytelling and gameplay sake, a lot of information was left up to the player's imagination.  First, the part where Gordon gets transported the Xen, he spends an undetermined amount of time there. We could argue that he also passed out the first and second times he teleported at Xen, and a third time when he arrived back to the test chamber. Second, when you leave the test chamber the scientists say ""We're trapped down here,"" which sort of implies they at least made an attempt to leave (granted they know they're underground, but they wouldn't know how trapped they are without looking). Third, when you first see zombies, it's fair to assume the mutation takes some time to happen. There's a corpse in a hallway with a headcrab munching away that hasn't turned zombie yet, so this points towards the process being over the course of hours. So the most conservative estimate I would give is probably up to three hours of Gordon zipping through space and having concussions to deal with.  You can ignore this next part: Seeing the state of panic some scientists are in (Office Space) and their feeble attempts to escape or hide, we could be looking at ""incident+1 day."" People got over their initial panic, waited a little bit for help to arrive, it didn't come, and now people are trying to find ways out. At the beginning of ""We've got hostiles"" a scientist's reaction to seeing a soldier is more of ""What took you so long"" rather than ""Wow, you got here quick."" This hints that a decent amount of time has passed already. The time span from the test chamber to the first encounter with the military seems short, which means that the military had the time to scramble a few hundred men and tanks to BMRF, get set up, and start exploring the base itself. I don't know military logistics, but I would imagine these things take more than a couple hours to reach decision making officers, gather a group together, and get them inserted into the facility.  That said, the most liberal length of time I think I would propose is that Gordon was gone for two or three days. This allows time for the number of alien monsters to be present, zombies and barnacles which probably take time to happen, and the time for the military to mobilize as much as they had."
HalfLife,33cn97,Mr_honesty_,2,Thu Apr 23 06:04:07 2015 UTC,"I guess about an hour or so. Just see how much destruction took place.  He was shot trough dimensions, he saw aliens."
HalfLife,33cn97,poedakis,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:24:05 2015 UTC,I would agree to at least 30 minutes. With the military flying in a response time would be about be about 10-20 min. taking time to reach the surface and by the reaction the military would take about one hour to meet up. So thirty unconscious and thirty to get almost to the surface as the military would have already been starting their operation. Sorry I love these kinda questions as they open the mind to tons of possibilities.

HalfLife,33be6q,Proxystarkilla,17,Tue Apr 21 03:34:04 2015 UTC,"In their eyes, the soldiers we see are just a police force; giving them MP7's and so on are just the equivelant of us giving our police batons, and sometimes tasers; with more powerful weaponry for extreme situations (using New Zealand police as comparison here). Why provide them with anything more powerful that they don't need?  As for why those specific guns, there was a theory I saw on tv tropes that the Advisors were presented with a collection of human weaponry to mass produce and provide to their soldiers, and, not being experts on human weaponry, just picked some that looked good. Not the most elegant scenario, but it seems fairly likely.  And regarding invading with them; none of the humanoid soldiers were involved in the invasion; those are all modified humans, mostly drawn from the human militaries following defeat; and they are the only Combine forces to use human weaponry. And for transport; they can only easily transport between dimensions, not within them. So getting technology to the Citadels is easy, but then they have to distribute it through local transport; Mossman says as much in Half-Life 2."

HalfLife,33be6q,ImperiumOfMankind,2,Wed Apr 22 01:51:40 2015 UTC,"Those are some fine points. We're also talking about the occupation stage and no longer the invasion. Nearly all of mankind has been wiped out or corralled into ""ghettos."" The more powerful Combine weapons aren't necessary any more and probably got sent to the next battlefield. As pointed out, players only every fight human Combine enemies. The weaponry the Combine itself uses probably can't be used by humans."

HalfLife,33be6q,2-4601,3,Tue Apr 21 16:38:54 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing: the controlling intelligence of the Combine aren't human, and the humans they do have aren't in a state to offer suggestions. So basically, they had to look at what the world's military had left, and go ""eeeeeh, that could work I guess"". It's kind of like walking into a car dealership for the first time with no idea of what stats and features are important besides the general idea of ""get in and go places""."
HalfLife,33be6q,ImperiumOfMankind,3,Tue Apr 21 22:05:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's mainly because for Civil Protection, they needed something that was easily relatable for humans i.e. a gun. For example, would you know how to use a pistol that your commander put in front of you easier then whatever alien pistol they put in front of you? Hopefully so. Otherwise you needed some explaining to do. That's also why Elites used AR-2s, because they were basically cyborgs and easy to basically ""program"" how to use alien tech."
HalfLife,33be6q,Whynotpie,2,Wed Apr 22 01:54:03 2015 UTC,"Considering that technology has been proven to not be linear and a peedictable path is it so hard to belive that, especially after all the weapons research we sqw in black mesa, thay humans are more advanced in hand heald weaponry after eons of battle and trillions in research?

HalfLife,33be6q,DuIstalri,4,Tue Apr 21 05:02:30 2015 UTC,"No, the Combine definitely have a huge technological edge over Earth; the only area where humanity is more advanced is teleportation; and only in point to point, their interdimensional technology is insane.

The Magnusson devices, Portal Guns, and the Zero Point Energy manipulator are pretty ahead of anything we've seen the combine use, and also many of the weapons we saw in the original half life (gauss gun and what not).   I like to think there's a lot more that we dont' know about too."
HalfLife,33be6q,DuIstalri,5,Tue Apr 21 05:26:16 2015 UTC,"Zero Point Energy manipulator is based on Combine Tech according to cut dialogue, which I would consider the canon answer until proven otherwise. Portal guns are teleportation. Magnusson devices are extremely clever, but they rely on Combine technology; on their own they do nothing, instead they cause an overload in the weaponry of the Strider.  Gauss Gun and Tesla Cannon don't really compare to what we see from the Combine's weaponry, and were highly experimental prototypes."
HalfLife,33be6q,Froggmann5,2,Tue Apr 21 05:28:48 2015 UTC,"Whether or not they were based on combine tech or not, the fact remains that humans currently have, or still have, many technological innovations that rival or have outdone standard combine technology."

Combine technology is more powerful, more advanced, and more widespread.  The only area where human tech, on its own, in a manner that can be successfully reproduced, rivals Combine tech is teleportation; and only in the sense that they have mastered point to point. The Combine still outclass them in both size of teleportation, and interdimensional teleportation."

HalfLife,33be6q,kingkolton9,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:26:41 2015 UTC,"Let's have a look here at things they've stolen that we've seen: All the synths, human weaponry (which includes most of Freeman's weapons, turrets, shells, batons, gas masks, emplacement guns, sniper rifles, laser sights, tripmines, hoppers and more)  APCs, pretty much their entire militia, all the materials they use, trains, they quarter wherever they feel, our oceans, keyboards (Advisors don't have fingers), what appear to be LCD screens, and I'm sure there's a lot I missed. Hell, the AR2 looks like it was based off of a human rifle, so there's another.  Let's not forget that they have thousands of planets under their belts. They take a lot. While the synths use energy weapons, that doesn't mean that particular species or the combine developed it."
HalfLife,33be6q,DuIstalri,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:04:09 2015 UTC,"Synths - are species, not technology. They've been turned into cyborgs using Combine technology.  Human weaponry styles - well, yeah, the technology has to be physically compatible with the individuals using it. They've either repurposed existing infrastructure, like with the trains and so on, or created human shaped models of pre-existing technology, with the AR2. After all, we would hardly expect Striders to wander around carrying AK-47s.  To suggest that they hadn't invented most of these things themselves is laughable. (also, oceans are not technology, nor are material resources. I know they are stealing resources, that's the whole point of their invasion. It's people suggesting that humanity is their technological equal or superior which I am disagreeing with.)  The Combine aren't a species. They are the Empire as a whole, with a collective society."
HalfLife,33be6q,eugd,2,Thu Apr 23 03:10:01 2015 UTC,"They do have the AR-7 (or is it AR-2?), which is a great piece of design showcasing the entire Combine aesthetic and 'philosophy' (at least, philosophy with regard to Earth/Humanity). A generic human assault rifle stock and receiver, just for ergonomics purposes and entirely non-functional, with the entirety of the functioning parts taking up a tiny area and being literal Space Magic (seriously, HOW DOES IT WORK). Also seemingly actually quite shit, or with some horribly limitations, or maybe Gordon just has it in a totally wrong fire mode (and it should, for example, have some several times the shot per clip, for minimal loss in effectiveness) or is just being stupid to not carry more ammo.

Just instead of one company of HECU Marines, you have almost all of the available forces - most of which were destroyed in 7 hours.  And it might not have been the combine's tech that led them to victory.  Think about it, five people with shoulder mounted rockets can take out their primary air vehicles.   Modern military fighters can track and engage MULTIPLE targets simultaneously.  In reality it was probably just overwhelming numbers and the lack of a coordinated effort to destroy them.  By the time humans got their sh*t together, well, they were at that point a ""resistance.""   For all we know, they came in peace...   or perhaps wanted people to believe they did.

There is a lot of mystery behind this negotiation between Breen and the Combine, some theories claim that Breen helped the Combine to invade earth and in repayment he got to become the leader of earth. What i am certain of is that there was something fishy going on with Wallace Breen."
HalfLife,33a9wu,Titser,10,Mon Apr 20 22:15:06 2015 UTC,"Well, Breen was the administrator of the Black Messa. The Big Boss Man of the whole facility that was experimenting with the portal technology.   During their research they managed to get in contact with the Combine. Mr Breen has decided to get them over to earth and the fact that he is actually an egocentric bastard has led him to running the earth when in actuality he was just a puppet controlled by the combine."

HalfLife,33a9wu,psychic_narwhal,6,Tue Apr 21 01:11:46 2015 UTC,"Breen had to have been in contact with the Combine before the invasion. The resonance cascade is supposedly what opened the link between Earth and Xen, but remember when you travel to Xen and find a human corpse wearing a hazard suit? We had obviously been there before and knew what was going on. We know that Nihilanth had been forced into exile basically to the Xen region by the Combine who wanted him dead. So Breen and Gman were collaborating to assist in the Combine invasion of Earth...Gman manipulates Freeman to ultimately get him to kill Nihilanth and Breen paves the way for the Combine takeover in exchange for the title of ""Earth's Administrator.""  That's just my theory anyway."
HalfLife,33a9wu,GuyWithTooMuchTime,2,Tue Apr 21 12:16:55 2015 UTC,"Hmm, interesting. Although it begs the question, why let the combine invade in the first place?

HalfLife,33a9wu,War_Dyn27,5,Tue Apr 21 20:56:33 2015 UTC,"Alright, here we go:  Let's take a look before the 7 Hour War. The Earth is most likely in chaos due to the resonance cascade that happened in the past. Aliens spread across the entire planets and the world population moved to large cities where the military would protect them. Humanity was in peril, but was overall safe. In time, the military would have eventually eliminated the Alien threat and would have been able to survive.  Of course, that is not what happens. Enter, the Combine.  Upon the portals opening, the world would have most likely gone in a panic. Why wouldn't they? Large fucking holes just opened in thin air followed by swarm upon swarm of big, scary weaponry.  The military would have to immediately scramble and assume positions to fight a force MUCH more powerful then the simple Xenians they were fighting.  However, the Combine have MULTIPLE advantages over Earth. They are super organised, super obedient, well trained, higher tech, and more numbers. MANY more numbers. During the initial battle, entire platoons were most likely wiped out in mere minutes, possibly even seconds. But why? How can the rebels, a loose group of make shift men made into soldiers, beat the Combine while a world military can't?  Simple.  The Combine VS Humans are a LOT like Britain during the revolutionary war. For those who don't know, Britain (The Combine) would set up mass lines upon lines and fire at once. Slowly advancing and marching onto the enemy. By god, if the enemy tried to do this as well, their ass would have been wiped out as Britain would destroy them. But, once America began guerrilla warfare, aka, moving along cover and modern combat strat, they won. The same applies here. The Combine are very powerful, but what they have in brute strength, they lack in rogue warfare.  So, the military, while using guerrilla warfare, couldn't compete. ""But you just said Guerrilla warfare is what defeats the big guys!"" Yes, this may be true, but the military never had someone to go back and sabotage, they weren't hidden at all, and they were all in very large cities, easily target-able by Combine forces.  The mass military would have been destroyed, if it weren't for the surrender of Earth by Breen, this is when the real purpose of the Combine shows.  So, why would the Combine just slaughter all of these capable soldiers? Why not, USE them? So, I say it would be safe to assume that the Combine did the smart thing, and began the assimilation. Basically, the Combine took all military soldiers, and anyone with a military background, and shipped them off to be made into OTA. If said person didn't quite meet expectations, as in they were still in boot camp, they would have been made into brainwashed Civil Protection units. It makes sense too. To avoid rebellion consisting of highly trained soldiers, take said soldiers, and put them on YOUR side. They are already fit and ready for harsh augmentations and brainwashing.  So, this is partially why the world population is cut down, is because of military assimilation. But it doesn't end there. Oooohhh no. This is where it gets dark.  You see, there are people in life that many first world government care for. They are disabled, mentally and/or physically. These people are supported for, and given a mostly safe life. We see pitiful people who need said help. This is not what the Combine see. The Combine see walking uselessness. These disabled people are either going to have disabilities that keep them from being in a social environment, or keep them from working. For those who don't know, a Combine city has three goals in mind: Social Stability, Work Force, and planned assimilation. If a Citizen doesn't meet all three of these, then he is considered unfit of normal life.  So, what happened to said people?  Well, sorry to say, but little Jimmy isn't going to receive his treatment.  The requirements for mental or physical unfitness is very small. For mental unfitness, if you had anything as little as simply being weird cause you like being weird, you were most likely considered mentally unfit. When I say being weird, just social awkwardness. And that just doesn't live up to the Combine/Unions dream of social paradise.  Physical Unfitness would be a little different. Instead of focusing on the social requirement, physical unfitness falls in the line of work and planned assimilation. If your body had anything wrong with it that made it unable to work, or unable to grow under Civil Protection training, you were most likely deemed unfit. But that doesn't mean that you can't be deemed unfit just because of disability to work, if you had, say, a large birthmark on your face, or a deformed face, you were most likely unfit. And trust me, they probably just mistook ugly people for deformed. Why? Well, such facial or structural deformities are, well, socially awkward. Not normal. And the Combine don't like it when you aren't the same as the rest.  So, what happened to these people?  Well, if your disabilities were minor, and they just barely met the requirement, then you were most likely Stalkerized. You were fixed up, and severely brainwashed until you were fit for Stalker work.  And for those that had major disabilities, such as uneven limbs, mental retardation, severe autism, etc, were most likely killed sadly. Due to their disability, the Combine wouldn't find any place for them. They couldn't be stalkerized unless they wanted to waste resources trying to fix this person.  So basically, if you are unfit, you were most likely stalkerized for minor cases, and killed for major cases.  That is another portion of humanity gone. It is quite large too. Remember, the deformities didn't  have to be major. Hell, if you had too much acne, you would have been unfit. And also, elderly have trouble working and won't live much longer.  Next are unruly people. It is obvious that not all humans just simply said ""Alright, enslave me!"". Some put up a fight. These people were most likely killed, or brainwashed into Civil Protection.  And finally, Children. ""Oh! Not the Children!"" Sadly, Children take up resources. On the optimistic side, one could say that they were sent to work in factories if you like beta lore. But remember, a citizen is heard saying ""I'm glad there are no children around to see this"", Implying that they are GONE. Again, Children are a major waste of resources for the Combine. They most likely DON'T want to have to wait 1-18 years for some child to grow up while having to waste resources to bring them to social standards and intelligence, and even feed them. So they were most likely rid of.  So, out of all of humanity, the only ones left are people who aren't: Soldiers, Children, Mentally or Physically deformed to the minor degree, and resistors.  That is a LOT of people. No wonder you see so little in the City.  Moving on, the Combine found it convenient that all the citizens just happen to be inside large, divided cities. So, they just smacked walls on all of them, put a giant tower in the middle, and call it good. They would then shut down the entirety of the internet as well as media. TV would be reduced to propaganda and speeches. The Citizen life would go as follow:  The normal Citizen would simply wake up, go to work, get rations, walk around and talk, watch breencast, and get yelled at and/or beaten by Civil Protection. They would be malnourished due to VERY little nutrients in rations. Then, CPs would beat their frail bones and berate them, causing mental anxiety and physical pains. The Combine would then slather propaganda all around: ""JOIN THE CIVIL PROTECTION! BETTER MEALS! PHYSICAL TRAINING! SOCIAL UNITY!"" This would cause your poor citizen to slowly break down until eventually they would snap and join the Civil Protection. They would serve as a recruit, scared into obedience. Once they reached a certain rank, they would most likely be brainwashed. Then, while being a Civil Protection, and once they reach a certain rank, they would be CONSTANTLY barraged to ""JOIN THE OVERWATCH TRANSHUMAN ARM! BECOME IMMORTAL! FIGHT FOR THE UNION!"" well, they are brainwashed, and they want to advance and actually become immortal. So, the Civil Protection unit would give in and join. They would be mind fuckingly brainwashed into uttermost obedience and voila, you have yourself an OTA unit ready to be shipped off.  This would go on until the Combine have converted every last person into an Overwatch unit. They would then turn any remaining Civil Protection into OTA. After that, they would ship the OTA off world to another planet and start mass mining of Earth's core for resources.  That pretty much ends it. Keep in mind, a lot of this is just assumption based on logic and estimation.  If you have any questions about the lore or you want me to explain my logic behind something, just ask."
HalfLife,33a9wu,tgkennedy,1 point,Wed Apr 22 05:26:39 2015 UTC,"Another thing to remember is that most of the Combine's invasion force left Earth after it was conquered. That's why virtually all their forces are human or appropriated Xen wildlife; they are making use of the 'resources' Earth already had at the time of the invasion. The force on Earth is a 'small' detachment, meant to watch over (hence the Overwatch) Earth while they drain it of all it's resources (and to figure out our teleportation tech). It's like what Eli said in episode 2; if the full force of the Combine attacked Earth now 'This time we wouldn't last 7 minutes'"
HalfLife,33a9wu,tgkennedy,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:36:54 2015 UTC,"Ah, yes, forgot to mention that. It is known that it was a small force.  Many people make the mistake of thinking that the Combine invasion force was compromised of Overwatch units.  While it is understandable why they would think this, it is wrong.  Based on the enemies that WERE going to be in the game, and the most logical answer, I assume that they used the Combine Synth Soldiers as well as synths like striders, gunships, and crab synths."
HalfLife,33a9wu,tgkennedy,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:19:52 2015 UTC,"Wow, that was a great read, thank you :)  Would you mind telling me how you know all this?"
HalfLife,33a9wu,tgkennedy,2,Wed Apr 22 14:31:03 2015 UTC,"I am a very large fan of the Half Life series and have done a lot of studying of it. Almost a full year of constant study. This covers the canon lore part at least.  I also based a lot of the lore on the fact that Half Life 2's city scene is HEAVILY inspired off of George Orwells famous book, ""1984"". It is a good read, you should read it.  Following that, a LOT of what I said was lore, followed by estimation based on logic, previous evidence, understanding of Resource driven powers, and social/mental understanding. Aka, how humans work, how large forces under one protocol work, etc.  Trust me, reading 1984 can help a LOT when it comes to understanding what the Combine most likely did in the background and why.  For instance, it was never covered what was going to happen to humans at a later time. But with clues, aka, receding water levels and wastelands, I pointed that too the combine wanting to gather as many resources as possible. OTA ARE humans. Why would the Combine simply kill the rest of the humans when they can make them into OTA? Well, they can't just go around saying ""Join the OTA and fight your own species to prove perfection! Get your mind fucked beyond belief and your body pumped full of chemicals to become immortal and never experience the release of death!"" or else nobody will join. So, based on Orwell's book, which City 17 is heavily inspired off of, which entailed using propaganda to convince Citizens to loyalty, I assumed that they most likely advertised Citizens to join the Civil Protection. ""Join the Civil Protection! Better food! Knowledge, better living!"" But if they already gave Citizens better living, knowledge, and food, then who would bother to join? So, it would be LOGICAL to assume that the Civil Protection are shitty to Citizens, give them horrible housing, and feed them terrible food so they can FORCE them to join. In which they would be brainwashed and converted to OTA.  TL;DR: I used head cannon, followed by comparison to 1984, to logical guesses, which can possibly be backed by head cannon. While it may not be the 100% truth, it certainly isn't far from it.  Ever heard of Half Life 2 Roleplay? Gmod gamemode based in the cities. While they do have to make their own lore, communities usually use what I use, comparison and logic to form the most accurate lore. However, I never used a servers lore in my explanation. But, joining an HL2RP game and sticking to it drives you to look up as much lore as possible, and then you start to make connections. ""So THIS is why they have shitty food. THIS is why there are no children. THIS is why you never see mentally disabled people in HL2!"" It really helps.  Anyways, if you need me to explain how I came to a conclusion on anything, just say so and I can give my reason why. While some of this may not be 100%, it is at least very close. Don't worry, I love talking about Half Life lore."

HalfLife,336iva,kingkolton9,6,Mon Apr 20 22:34:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly I wish that Black Mesa didn't make you crouch jump so much. There were many, many jumps that were possible to make in Half-Life without crouch jumping and it seems like every jump in Black Mesa has to be a crouch jump. Why would you not just bind spacebar to jump AND crouch if you wanted to make every jump a crouch jump? I don't get why they thought that having so many crouch jumps was a good idea."
HalfLife,336iva,JedTheKrampus,2,Tue Apr 21 01:04:46 2015 UTC,I spent 10 minutes only skipping from random parts and he was having a problem every single time. Why doesn't he know how to crouch jump? Isn't the obvious thing to do when jumping is bringing your legs up?

I imagine those who aren't familiar with crouch jumping  would expect crouching in mid-air to bring you down (thus not affecting the height of your feet) or to do nothing at all.  Oh, and he plays with a controller."
HalfLife,336iva,jonnywoh,2,Mon Apr 20 16:30:36 2015 UTC,"Yuck. Crouch jumping comes naturally to me now when playing on PC.

HalfLife,336iva,nihilinth,3,Mon Apr 20 16:41:48 2015 UTC,"He seemed to be pretty poor at picking up on the game's cues.  Also, I just rewatched the beginning again and he implied he's pretty much exclusively a console gamer.  No offense to console gamers, but he seems to fit the ""console peasant"" stereotype.  He talks about how Half-Life ""really brought video games into a cinematic experience"" (referring to how there are no cutscenes, which isn't cinematic.  It's immersive.  ""Cinematic"" is a buzzword console devs hide behind to avoid addressing console limitations.)  Edit: And he's filming the screen.  And he just keeps going with the foul mouth as if it's funny.  And he claims he played HL2 but clearly has no recollection of it.  I could go on, but I need to do other things rather than watch it over again.  Edit: He does see ""how to crouch jump"" at 6:38 but dismisses it because he doesn't know what crouch-jump means.  He somehow failed to realize the game was telling him how to crouch-jump and that he needed to do it then."

HalfLife,336iva,alphatrooper987,2,Mon Apr 20 02:59:37 2015 UTC,"I've been playing through HL1 recently and while I do the same you do when watching others, I noticed that a lot of the level design really doesn't make sense to new comers.  It's very obvious the game was rushed in some areas.    For example, the Gargantua in Surface Tension is a very poorly designed boss fight.  So many things are broken in that one sequence it isn't even funny.  Firstly, the Gargantua won't chase you unless you grab its attention first.  This is the opposite of Power Up's Gargantua, which teaches you to fear it at all times and to run whenever you see it.  Then, the Xen trampoline is buggy as shit and won't always fling you up like it should.  When it does, you HAVE to land in the water in the silo.  Trying to land on the platform with the radio will make you bounce off and hit the ground (and take damage).  Then you have an entirely foreign mechanic that you have to learn under the pressure of knowing you have limited time before the Gargantua kills you.  Not only that, the entire interface is completely un-intutiive and it's damn near impossible to tell where you're aiming without copious amounts of trial and error.  And to top it all off, the Gargantua can CLIMB UP THE RAMP and kill you before you ever get a chance to lock onto it — on another note, props to the Black Mesa team for fixing that and making it fun!  A lot of the level design is very different from HL2.  HL2's is good because it is play tested to hell, so Valve knows before shipping the game what works and what doesn't.  The odds of you being ""stuck"" in an area for too long are really slim.  Also, they never introduce a mechanic when it's needed.  They'll introduce it in a relatively safe environment and have you work up to a boss or something fun, which often feels like a reward rather than a hard challenge."

Where the Gargi will climb up the slope, and I could hear its footsteps moving closer when he was looking down at the map, and I was frantically typing in the Twitch chat: ""HE'S NEXT TO YOU! DUCK!"", as well as having to warn him about that shockwave-type attack, because he didn't think it actually did anything. He was also having a lot of trouble with the RPG when fighting the chopper when you're on the canyon side. He was so bad at using it, because he was used to the H-L 2 mechanic where the rocket will eventually go back to the target if you over shoot it. So he just kept missing it, and he always deactivated the laser tracking."

HalfLife,336u2k,LazerdongFacemelter,5,Mon Apr 20 02:18:18 2015 UTC,"I guess you could do a game that isnt focused around Gordon, but (some) people didnt react all that well to BS and OF. I loved them and would totally be up for something like that, but others may not be."
HalfLife,336u2k,LazerdongFacemelter,2,Mon Apr 20 02:20:57 2015 UTC,Maybe it could be more focused on the G-Man?

HalfLife,335p4l,FLy1nRabBit,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:21:46 2015 UTC,Mark already said that nothing in the games are cannon so the writers can feel a bit more free when they let their genius out.
HalfLife,335p4l,NEWaytheWIND,11,Tue Apr 21 21:59:05 2015 UTC,"GLaDOS and every other intelligence from Aperture Science can be considered an unreliable narrator. For all we know, Chell was asleep no more than a few days after the events of Portal.  If Chell was actually in stasis for 50,000 years, we still can't be sure of any resolutions from the Half-Life games. We don't know if the Combine have been defeated, if humanity still exists, if Gordon Freeman is dead, or anything else specific. We can be sure that Earth and wheat fields made it in tact after 50,000 years, though :)"

HalfLife,335p4l,Riomaki,5,Mon Apr 20 06:45:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Think of what remnants of human civilization still exist from just 2,000 years ago and what shape they're in.  Ancient Greece and Rome are in ruins.  And they built things from a monolithic standpoint, meant to stand up to the ravages of time.  Now picture 25x that period.  Our best structures today wouldn't last anywhere near that long, and surely a hastily-built and positively enormous underground laboratory wouldn't either."
HalfLife,335p4l,AQ90,5,Mon Apr 20 15:28:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, because as stated before, The earth has water in the portal/moon cut scene. So take into mind that the combine drained all the water on earth, but in Portal 2 we see the earth with water."

HalfLife,333ann,Gkkiux,4,Sun Apr 19 08:58:00 2015 UTC,"The game has a feature where when you jump, you get a little bit of speed. However, because of this glitch, called bunnyhopping, if you hit the ground and jump in the same frame, you get to keep that extra little bit of speed and get more. You can get up to insane amounts of speed.   Then, they patched it. Now, when you go forward too fast, the game simulates air resistance by applying backwards force to you. However, if you bunnyhop backwards, the game applies that force, pushing you even further backwards, allowing you to go super fast."

HalfLife,336qbx,SupDos,3,Mon Apr 20 01:38:57 2015 UTC,The FAQ in our wiki covers these questions: https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/wiki/faq
HalfLife,336qbx,csapdani,2,Mon Apr 20 05:53:05 2015 UTC,"Definitely play the Half-Life 1 Anthology first, and yes, avoid Half-Life: Source if you can. Half-Life is graphically outdated, but game-play wise is equal to, or better than, Half-Life 2. However, Half-Life doesn't hold your hand at all, and many who are new to gaming/shooters might get stuck. I'd recommend BigMacDavis for all your walkthrough needs."
HalfLife,336qbx,HalfLife1MasterRace,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:22:18 2015 UTC,"I knew you were gonna say this, but I agree anyway."
HalfLife,336qbx,MacedoniaBall,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:01:47 2015 UTC,"If you really want to go through the whole thing it would be best to go HL1 - Expansions - HL2 - Episodes and throw in Portal1/2 if you haven't got them. They have some minor corrections in canon and are just joys to play by themselves. Now, the thing about HL2 is that even if you have played HL1 you'll still be confused because it's meant to make a disorientating beginning.  I recommend HL1 first, - don't worry about the age, because it holds up very well in gameplay and even graphically it still serves. If you find it difficult keep in mind HL2 is easier. But HL2 CAN be done first because aside from a few references which you can parse if you pay attention and fill in the dots yourself it is in the main very close to a standalone story."
HalfLife,336qbx,KaramazovTheUnhappy,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:24:04 2015 UTC,"You're right to not bother with Half-Life: Source.  It's very poorly done.  Personally, I would start wherever you want to start.  HL1 and HL2 aren't so tightly woven that you need to play them in order.  I didn't.  If nothing else, if you find that HL2 hooks you, you'll want to go back to HL1 just to see how we got here.  Plus there are some things that you might appreciate more in reverse.  There's a reason why people think the HECU are way more threatening than the Combine, despite having simpler AI.  While I still think HL2 is the better game, there are lots of things I respect more about HL1 knowing about HL2, if that makes sense.  It's like playing System Shock 2 after BioShock."
HalfLife,336qbx,Riomaki,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:17:42 2015 UTC,"I got the Orange Box as a gift when I was in high school and I hadn't yet played HL1. At the time the Legend of Zelda 64 games were my favorite. HL2 blew my mind! A couple years later I finally got around to HL1 and my mind was blown again!  The story of the Half-Life/Portal series is the best part! There's a lot going on. My dad and grandpa have both worked for Los Alamos National Labs, so I really like exploring the top-secret levels of Black Mesa and Aperture. But I can patiently wait for the epic I hope will be HL3"
HalfLife,336qbx,BorderTrike,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:58:26 2015 UTC,"Yes but you can understand HL2 without playing HL1,if you don't like HL1 because of the graphics or gameplay you can wait for Black Mesa (is a HL1 remake in Source engine made by fans)"
