TwoXChromosomes,3e2xrm,Sybles,148,Tue Jul 21 15:33:51 2015 UTC,"Although the article uses the word banned several times if you read the comments from the event organisers you can see that drag acts haven't been 'banned' as much as aren't being hired as entertainment.  A statement from the organisers said: “After much discussion, the trans and non binary caucus decided not to have drag acts perform at the event.  “This does not mean that people of any gender can’t wear what they want to the event""  I'm sure most people wouldn't be offended by drag acts at all, but there is the side of drag performances which portrays men in women's clothes as a comedy act. I guess they just wanted to avoid that side of things for their pride parade."
TwoXChromosomes,3e2xrm,GeorgersaurusRex,13,Tue Jul 21 18:12:42 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer. There is no D in LGBT(QIAA2SP...). Gay men can dress how they want, but I agree with the organizers decision not to have any cis people perform drag on stage, as it makes light of absolutely everything that causes trans people to be marginalized, attacked, and murdered in our culture.  Drag is a privilege, a performance, and comedy. It is not someones real life experience. Cis people who perform drag have the privilege of taking off their ~hilarious costume~ at the end of the show.   People suggesting that it's not fair are conflating entertainment and reality."
TwoXChromosomes,3e2xrm,transhelpinfo,27,Tue Jul 21 19:00:01 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a transgender woman (And keeping in mind that I don't speak for the entire trans community,)  This is honestly the stupidest thing ever.  Yes, drag performance can be offensive to trans people - After all, it's taking the ""Man dresses like a woman"" concept, and turning it into entertainment. Then cis people tend to equate drag with trans people. It's not the performance itself that bothers me, it's the fact that there's no education on the difference between somebody being transgender, and somebody doing drag. (Or the fact that famous drag performers like Ru Paul have tried to claim that they should be allowed to use certain transphobic slurs, but that's another issue.)  So yes, I don't like drag. Most GSM events I've gone to have had drag shows for some inane reason, and I've hated it.  But you know what? I just didn't watch. Because I'm a normal human being who knows she can't always get her way. And that's fine! Banning drag performers (Many of whom are gay or not 100% cis,) is just a bad move on the organizer's part."

TwoXChromosomes,3dzwbz,JesterMarcus,14,Tue Jul 21 04:15:42 2015 UTC,"When people say things like that, I don't believe they intend it to be a long term solution and then the matter is closed. I always felt it was meant as a short term solution to ensure safety for the time being.  When using the rape example for instance, eradicating rape by teaching men is a very long term effort, it could take generations possibly.

TwoXChromosomes,3dzwbz,undercurrents,9,Tue Jul 21 04:17:09 2015 UTC,"No, I completely agree with the idea of teaching how to protect yourself and how to potentially avoid dangerous situations. I think it's more how the article included that line as the final summary, and given the seriousness of the issue, saying, ""Women! [This] and [that] are your friends!"" seems condescending. Plus, I don't like Pinterest, I like Reddit, I like Youtube, and even though I don't game, there are plenty of women who love the gaming world. This isn't like avoiding dark alleys. This is saying us women should stick to places we are more accepted versus making the issue about why are these places not being more welcoming and accepting of women.   While getting quotes from a comment I wrote below, I came across a bunch of articles of harassment from the opposite end- so rather than threats, women who host YouTube channels get constant comments about their looks, like, ""Only one of the five are you are hot, the rest of you should be covered in burkas in the kitchen."" or ""If I watch a video with women in it, they better be hot"" or ""I want to see more tits."" ComicCon had a panel about it with women who host podcasts, vlogging, and youtube channels and just how bad it gets.   So the end of the article, by telling women they should stay out of male dominated environments, is basically like saying, ""if you don't want to get raped, stay in the garden and grocery stores, and away from sports' stadiums. And if you do, we did warn you to stick to places that are ""your friends."""

Comments like these, in my mind, support the stereotype that men are all sex-fiends who just aren't educated enough to control themselves. Rapists rape, not men.

Until we fix the broken male-female dynamic, nothing will change."
TwoXChromosomes,3dzwbz,undercurrents,26,Tue Jul 21 05:06:32 2015 UTC,"The idea that we should teach men not to rape seems stupid because most men don't rape and everyone knows it's wrong.    oh, no, not at all. I'm not trying to insult you, but you should probably look into volunteering at a domestic abuse shelter or a rape counsel center, because that is a very naive view. Many men see it as their right- especially when it comes to marital rape, which many men don't even believe is a crime. Others justify it completely by saying the way she was dressed meant that's what she wanted, or that even though she said no, her body was saying yes. Or others argue rape is intrinsic to men's nature and satisfies ancient, ingrained primal needs.  And remember that whole fiasco a few years back and the idea of legitimate rape? Because a woman's body apparently shuts down during a rape, so if you get wet and allow sperm to penetrate, that means you wanted it and you weren't raped.   But when saying we need to teach men not to rape, it means more about teaching men to respect women and to not see all women as potential sex objects (in the positive and negative way- which I bring up in my comment below where men make comments (both blatantly insulting as well as lame pick up lines) on videos and pictures that have nothing to do with physical looks.  I am certainly not saying all men rape, or would rape unless they are told not to- the majority of men would never even attempt such a thing, nor are only holding themselves back simply because of the illegality. But plenty of men (and women) don't see rape as an all or nothing issue, they see gray area where they can justify it as acceptable and don't even see their actions as rape. Then they victim blame. Obviously the Cosby controversy is a perfect example of that. The fact that there are ""sides"" in this issue even though no one is denying that he did, in fact, drug the women he had sex with. People are claiming the women shouldn't have gone up to his room, or they are only coming forward now claiming it was rape for fame and money, or simply because they had consensual sex and now regret it. The entire idea behind victim blaming means people don't see rape as wrong, plain and simple. They are perfectly fine with scenarios where a woman was clearly raped, but it was her own fault- not that the man did anything wrong. Whenever you add a justification to anything illegal, that means you don't necessarily see the actions as wrong, or even cause to be reported.   There is also a flipside where people see absolutely nothing wrong with older women having sex with underage boys and do not at all see that as rape/statutory rape (South Park even did an episode on it).   And outside of America, women who are raped are considered filthy by their families and communities and become outcasts, some are killed by their families for dishonoring them, and many, many women are attacked and killed for reporting rapes and gang rapes. In some cultures they believe raping babies is a way to cure AIDS, and again see no wrongdoing in those actions.  Check into documentaries like this,   The Invisible War  The Hunting Grounds  The Pink Saris  The Gulabi Gang (same group as the Pink Saris)  And this is just a first few articles on a google search of men thinking rape is ok:    http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/01/lots-of-men-dont-think-rape-is-rape.html http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-most-indian-men-think-about-rape-2015-3 http://www.rawstory.com/2013/10/mens-rights-activist-explains-why-its-ok-to-not-care-about-female-rape-victims/ http://www.rt.com/news/237285-india-rape-woman-attacker/    Mukesh Singh aired his views in a documentary: ""She should just be silent and allow the rape...

The attitude of his police force was shockingly documented in April, when reporters from Tehelka magazine, working undercover, recorded their conversations with thirty Delhi police officers who blamed women for being raped, naming “everything from fashionable or revealing clothes to having boyfriends to visiting pubs to consuming alcohol to working alongside men as the main reasons for instances of rape.” The had argued, for example, that “in truth, the ones who complain are only those who have turned rape into a business.”    http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2014/10/28/punished-for-being-raped-the-burden-of-women-under-sharia/ http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/107862/price-refusing-kill-your-gang-raped-child-frank-crimi (A Pakistani family is under brutal assault for refusing to murder their daughter for being a victim of rape.) http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/1362134/South-African-men-rape-babies-as-cure-for-Aids.html (South African men rape babies as 'cure' for Aids) http://www.irinnews.org/report/55920/central-african-republic-unending-misery-of-rape-victims    Most rape victims say they are still shamed and rejected by their communities, and many try to avoid humiliation by staying indoors; many girls have dropped out of school because insensitive classmates laugh, rather than sympathise, with their ordeal; older victims feel ostracised by their neighbours, husbands and relatives.      edit: back to the issue of online harassment, here's an excellent clip by John Oliver about online harassment including threats of bodily harm and revenge porn - did you know in order to get pics posted without your permission taken down, you need to claim copyright which means you need to send naked pics of yourself to the copyright office?  Also, what this article doesn't mention are the type of online threats women are receiving. John Oliver shows some in his segment, but here are some more I've seen recently. The harassment often involves threats of rape, murder, and mutilation.    ""Women are the niggers of gender. If you killed yourself, I wouldn’t even fuck the corpse.""   'Die, you fucking cunt! You'll know when I rape your mouth hole, bitch!""  “Get off your period and shave your armpits. And cook me dinner dammit”  “Does this rag smell like chloroform to you?﻿”     edit 2: adding this study/article that /u/fivecentpsychiatrist mentioned: https://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2009/11/12/meet-the-predators/   If a survey asks men, for example, if they ever “had sexual intercourse with somone, even though they did not want to, because they were too intoxicated (on alcohol or drugs) to resist your sexual advances,” some of them will say yes, as long as the questions don’t use the “R” word."

I don't think that this is related to gender/age/race/whatever in itself but rather it is just convenient to pick on whoever is the one that stands out from the norm in order to preserve your own face and status. It is still possible that men are more likely to engage in this activity but I wouldn't make any definitive conclusions from this study as it is a very limited case."

Adding I'n gender dynamics is interesting, but it makes sense that they'd go for the girls first...

You wouldn't expect that from people who literally make a living off of it. There was a girl in one o the customs we played and no one made any comments about it, they just talked to her like normal.

I know that their attitude is directly related to their shitty gaming experience (perceived or actual lack of skill), so it's pretty easy to find the right buttons to push to set them off. I know that they won't just walk away, unless their console and TV is complete shattered, in which case I've done my job.  On the other hand, I do feel ashamed when male gamers pick on female gamers, especially because their comments can be almost criminally inappropriate, and many players won't stand up for female gamers (male and female alike). I have to be careful with how I handle those situations, because my blood boils a little bit, and you can't let that show when counter-trolling."

TwoXChromosomes,3dzwbz,tiki77747,59,Tue Jul 21 01:10:25 2015 UTC,"This study does a good job pointing out that males are insecure if they aren't very highly skilled, and are playing with women who are as good as or better than them. But this study is ignoring something that I think is equally important to make note of:  ""A chart from the Halo study that shows how nice male gamers were to other males (dotted line) and females (solid line) during gameplay. Men always treat each other about the same. But the better a player gets, the more likely he is to be nice to ladies.""  Males are always equally nice to each other no matter how good or bad they are at the game. But they are much nicer to females than they are to males if they are good at the game. This behavior, in my eyes, is just as chauvinistic as that of the low-skilled players. In my experience as a high-level competitive male gamer, a lot of these niceties come from the notion that girls aren't naturally cut out to play games or something. Good male players will compliment women for exhibiting mastery of very basic, standard components of gameplay and they would never compliment other men for the same things. It's pretty obvious that these high-level gamers are still treating women as lesser players, or players with less potential, just because they're women -- it's almost like male gamers think being a girl is a disability.   And if there are extremely good women in the scene, then the same insecurities pop up in the highest level males. There is a woman who plays StarCraft II under the pseudonym ""LiviBee,"" and she consistently ranks within the top 0.5% of players in North America. And because she is a woman who is better than almost everyone, she gets enormous amounts of flak from male gamers of ALL levels.   TL;DR - Obviously there are lots of highly-skilled males who are very good and who are very willing to treat female gamers with respect, but just because the majority are ""nicer to females"" doesn't mean that they respect them any more than lower-skilled males do. I wish this study explored respect in a different way."

Quote from the papers introduction,"" a much clearer understanding of sexist behaviour is reached using evolutionary theory as it incorporates both a social and biological perspective"". It seems that whenever he mentions ""evolutionary theory"" he is referencing the work detailed in ""Not By Genes Alone, How Culture Transformed Human Evolution"". The paper then goes on to try and use its findings to support the use of ""evolutionary theory"" by showing that the players aggression is related to both their fitness as a mate and and their perceived location in the social hierarchy. That is why they argued Halo 3 was such a good study platform because it removed several social feedback mechanisms that may create an additional bias. Players only knew their skill level, how it compared to others, and in this study, the sex of some of the players. So not really about genes so much as about our fitness as a mate and our location in a social hierarchy."

I cant speak for those online but the ones ive met in real life tended to be men who were shy, low confidence, and not very good at meeting and flirting with women so were often snubbed. Some just got attached to girls who were very clearly not interested in them that way (thinking that being a super nice guy would make her change her mind. No it just makes her think you are a super nice guy so great friend material) or would flirt in rude or condesending ways. Some were misinformed by the whole chivalry bullshit and a few were even taken advantage of (not sexually but monetarily or in some other way) by women who clearly knew they could use those types of guys that way. They were all losers when it came to romance and love and sometimes all social circles. Then they find red pill and learn confidence and how to not get stuck on a girl that obviously isnt interested but they also pick up manipulation and sexism that is much worse and more blatant than chivalry ever was. If they keep the nice guy but add in confidence, directness, and some fitness and cleanliness habits i garentee you they could go for almost any girl and get them. Sadly now they just mistreat them and give all men a bad name in that girls eyes. Yet they act like its this new found sexism that makes them so awesome. No, its the fact that you are actually approaching them and flirting and being a little charming. It really isnt that hard to make a good impression on a women. As for the subreddit itself that is a dark hole of sudoscience and mysogeny that reminds me of a bunch of racists having a discussion on how to make black people like you."

TwoXChromosomes,3dzwbz,AlphaBroMan,22,Tue Jul 21 15:13:45 2015 UTC,I have a background in medical research. We use biological models ALL the time. However it's understood that you can't just extrapolate your findings out from them. A great amount of additional study/proof is needed. How can we reasonably say that the studies findings on halo 3 gamers is extrapolatable to all online interactions? Do you think all demographics were properly represented in this study? This study looked at behavior in one setting (online gaming in One game). How do we know that this translates over to other online settings?
TwoXChromosomes,3dzwbz,quantum_lotus,6,Tue Jul 21 02:58:59 2015 UTC,You might be interested in the actual research article from PLoS One.  The authors were looking to test if    female-initiated disruption of a male hierarchy incites hostile behaviour from poor performing males who stand to lose the most status.   It reads to me that the authors were using these games in Halo 3 to look at the behavior of men towards a woman in the same way I might use a mouse model to study a human disease.
TwoXChromosomes,3dzwbz,AlphaBroMan,7,Tue Jul 21 03:16:12 2015 UTC,"I quickly read over the study. It seemed like it was decently conducted. My only issue was the paper didn't mention if the test players were blinded to the gender they were playing under. However this info is probably contained somewhere within Kuznekoff and Rose’s (2013) original study.  The mouse model is wonderful, but there are limitations to it. That's why additional study is always needed to validate it's findings. It would be irresponsible to report model organism only findings as fact but unfortunately this happens all the time in the media. I would argue this is like one of those times. However I'm ignorant to the way social science research is conducted so maybe they have a different standard as to what constitutes proof."

Honestly that was her and my biggest concern. Knowing that they are there because of what they believe is a huge relief. I will be calling a center near her area as soon as they open.
TwoXChromosomes,3e1rfb,iPADboner,8,Tue Jul 21 16:01:45 2015 UTC,"Just having you there will have a calming effect on her. You just have to appear outwardly calm, and if you need to speak to somebody to get to that stage, do it."

TwoXChromosomes,3e1rfb,ultrafud,41,Tue Jul 21 17:14:27 2015 UTC,Depends on the state.
TwoXChromosomes,3e1rfb,ExtrasiAlb,15,Tue Jul 21 18:07:52 2015 UTC,"^ Yep, this. There are really only two options, get an abortion or have the baby. This is the only decision that needs to be made, and made asap.  Telling your parents should depend on how you think they might react. If you think they may try to influence her to keep the child against her wishes, it might be smart to talk to her before about what SHE wants. However if your parents would be supportive no matter what, then perhaps tell them first as they may help her come to a decision. They may also be able to expedite any health care issues you may be unsure about, being adults n all. Either way, decisions need to be made and need to be made fast, its not something you can sit on.  You can start dealing with Step 2 and 3 after."
TwoXChromosomes,3e1rfb,nomstomp,40,Tue Jul 21 15:41:10 2015 UTC,I don't know that a 14 year old is capable of knowing whether or not they want a baby...

TwoXChromosomes,3e1rfb,ExtrasiAlb,8,Tue Jul 21 17:30:00 2015 UTC,So make them have the baby by default? Brilliant.
TwoXChromosomes,3e1rfb,Smangler,10,Tue Jul 21 18:09:14 2015 UTC,"That's not what I meant. I guess I should have clarified. I meant that the first thing you should do is tell your parents. Don't hide it from them for a second. I'm pro choice, I would never force a baby on anyway. If I ever had that opportunity."
TwoXChromosomes,3e1rfb,bubafina,4,Tue Jul 21 19:13:59 2015 UTC,"Hi OP. First of all, give your sister a big hug and tell her you support her. Second, even though she's got some tough choices to make, her life isn't over!! These are definitely HUGE decisions to make, but, other than some crazy-unlikely scenario, she's not going to die. Third, speak to her honestly and frankly about what SHE wants. Most of all, don't panic. She's said she doesn't want the baby which is completely fair. Now, do some research (you've started, which is good).  11 weeks is NOT too late to consider an abortion. Definitely check out Planned Parenthood. Go with her. Hold her hand. Hug her. Listen to her when she freaks out and rambles on about 'what if this' and 'what if that' and works herself into a frenzy. Calm her down and be there for her.   As an aside, one thing guys often do that will piss a lot of women off: when we're freaking out with a problem and start talking about it, a lot of guys want to jump in with solutions, when all we want is someone to listen. Be that someone to listen instead of the person with answers. It sounds like she's already made her decision and needs time to work through it in her head.  Okay, so decision made. Now, you need to ask yourself a question: do you tell your parents? This is something you need to wrestle with on your own. She obviously doesn't want you telling them. I'll be honest, I don't advocate telling them either, but I'm not in your situation. I don't know you or your sister or your parents. As difficult as it may be to accept, they may be in a better position to help your sister than you are. You don't say much about them, so I have absolutely no idea. I also don't know about the legalities as I'm in Canada. Some other TwoXer would have better info than I.  Next, open Chrome, go into incognito mode, come back here, and follow this link: Planned Parenthood. It'll take you to Planned Parenthood's page titled ""I'm pregnant, now what?"". Read it with her. Talk about what you're reading.   Ultimately, you're probably going to be going to the clinic with her. Chances are, she'll have to speak to a councilor before the procedure. They will discuss birth control options, mostly, and what to expect from the procedure. When I had mine (mind you, I was 35, so in a completely different scenario), I laid down on a table, was given an anesthetic, and it felt not much different than a regular pap, before I went under. I woke up a little while later, ate a cracker, and half an hour later, my boyfriend was able to take me home. If you want more details about the actual procedure, PM me and we can talk.   After the procedure, be there for her. There are as many different emotional reactions afterwards as there are situations that women find themselves in. Each one of those is valid. Listen. Hug. Be supportive. Help her find a councilor/therapist if necessary.   Above all, keep faith in your sister. Reassure her. Just because she made a mistake, she's not a horrible person. And keep faith in yourself too. Trust yourself and your choices."
TwoXChromosomes,3e1rfb,TooMuchCCPlsStahp,6,Tue Jul 21 11:50:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you SOOO much for your reply! This is truly helpful and this is the type of information I cannot find on the web. Thank you, just thank you so much kind stranger! ='D  After thinking about this for a little while, the only thing that I AM concerned about is hugging her and showing lots of affection towards her in public. We don't exactly hug and stuff, only when she needs it. But I'm just kind of weary of that fact that some people might think the child is mine if I do that.   Actually you know what, I don't care what people think. That's my little sister and I'm going to give her all the emotional support she needs.   As for parents, I've looked up the laws and it seems that in California it is not necessary to notify the parents, so that is a plus. I don't believe they would be in a better position to help her, in fact they'd do far worse damage if they knew.   My questions to you are: How long did the entire procedure take? Was there any after/side effects you had?"
TwoXChromosomes,3e1rfb,Ioethe,8,Tue Jul 21 15:53:45 2015 UTC,"very frankly speaking, she needs someone to take her to get an abortion, and helping her through that is probably the best thing you can so for her. i don't want to beat around the bush- her options will be more limited or less effective after the first three months of pregnancy (abortion pills are less effective in the fourth month and not viable after that), so it's very important that action be taken as soon as possible. it may already be too late for the two most common forms of abortions that don't require major hospitalization (surgical and medical), given that it likely happened before her missed period, but she needs to get to a doctor (planned parenthood may be perfect for this) and take action on this regardless. it's up to you and her to figure out the best way for it to happen, but abortion is her only choice outside of having the baby.   having your support through this will make a huge difference to her. you're a good brother- i know dealing with this is very distressing, and you're handling it admirably. thank you for trusting us to help."
TwoXChromosomes,3e1rfb,DopeRhymes,7,Tue Jul 21 09:31:16 2015 UTC,"According to the PlannedParenthood website, she can get the ""aspiration"" procedure done within 14 weeks of her pregnancy. She says it happened during mid May, but I'm sticking to May 1 to be safe so that we can just go from her last period.   I'm planning on staying with her throughout the entire procedure, I've already explained all her options to her.

TwoXChromosomes,3e1rfb,a_pure_heart,5,Tue Jul 21 15:57:55 2015 UTC,"I'm really glad that she has you as her confidant.  You are in an ideal position to help her get through this, and with your companionship and guidance, learn as much as she can from this experience.  As a parent, I would hope that you could confide in your parents about this situation, especially because it involves the health of someone so young. However, if their unconditional love and/or support is not a given, then it is probably best handled yourselves.  If the circumstances leading to this situation are clearly (if the father is NOT close to her age)a matter involving consent of a minor, then part of your responsibility as her confidant and as an adult needs to include involving the appropriate law authorities as well as your parents.  This will all be behind both of you soon, but until then, be her rock as best you can.  She's lucky to have you."
TwoXChromosomes,3e1rfb,Sen_f10,5,Tue Jul 21 15:57:32 2015 UTC,"Hearing this from a parent is extremely helpful. Thank you for your time and help.

And as for the father, he is her then boyfriend (it's so easy to forget that at around the middle school age many begin to date) but she has not told him. They are about the same age."
TwoXChromosomes,3e1rfb,elnino2015,2,Tue Jul 21 16:11:02 2015 UTC,"Ok. Keeping the parents out of the picture is the right decision, then.    The only possible issue with that I can see is the slight chance of a complication with a medical procedure on a minor.  Planned Parenthood will be able to advise you best on that, and I would hope, that if need be, your age and familial relationship would be enough to get past any document hurdles, as her unofficial guardian.   Speaking of which, just by your appearance, you MAY raise some eyebrows along the way in your quest to help your sister.  You should know that chances are you will be questioned about whether YOU might be responsible for this pregnancy.  This is standard procedure for health providers in this kind of situation, as part of the process of assistance.  Please do not be offended, as they are only trying to help.  Having her boyfriend present will help avoid any untoward assumptions, so include him if at all possible. His presence is important as a sign of support, but it should be as much of a learning experience for him as it is for her, even if he isn't the one with the uterus.    I would advise you to use caution, though, as far as the logistics of his presence goes, for while he needs to be there for his girlfriend, the more involved he is, the greater the risk of unreasonable parents becoming involved (his and yours).   (I think it's safe to assume that they are also unreasonable parents, since they managed to raise a kid who has unprotected sex.)  If you need any more input from a reasonable, sex-positive parent, I'll be here."
TwoXChromosomes,3e1rfb,captchyanotapassword,6,Tue Jul 21 16:46:55 2015 UTC,"I've read up on the side affects of this procedure and thinking about her having some sort of terrible complication is scaring the life out of me right now. She wants this done with, she's done her own fair share of research before I even knew, but she told me because she trusts me and because she knows that she can't go alone.   The bit about raising eyebrows, THAT also scares me VERY much. The last thing I want is for the employees there to think I'm the one who did this, just thinking about makes me begin to panic. I'm not very good at confrontation. I'm just going to call a center and speak to whoever is available, tell them everything and show them this thread.   Her boyfriend is currently out of the picture. She is not dating him, and I do agree that having him there will definitely help. The only issue is that having him find a way and convincing his parents to join us without alarming them as to what's happened so that we avoid our parents being alerted as well. I feel like having him there wouldn't help my little sister, only cause her more stress and duress. And on top of that, time is of the essence here, I can't waste anymore time trying to find a way to get him to come with us.   I'd also like to point out that (according to my sister), they used protection but the condom ripped or slipped at some point.   Thank you so much for your advice. Every time I open up this thread and read the comments I feel a sense of dread and fear but it's comments like yours that help me and my sister feel more at ease about this whole situation. Thank you so much."
TwoXChromosomes,3e1rfb,flawlessqueen,2,Tue Jul 21 17:49:12 2015 UTC,"Abortion, especially in the first trimester, is one of the safest medical procedures you can get. Complications are rare. You're far more likely to suffer serious complications from giving birth."
TwoXChromosomes,3e1rfb,flawlessqueen,5,Tue Jul 21 18:14:12 2015 UTC,"Okay, first off, deep breath and RELAX.  While abortion does have some potentially serious complications, the fact is that those complications are very, very rare.  First-trimester abortions are safer than going into the dentist to get your wisdom teeth taken out, and nobody thinks twice about that.  Usually if there are complications, it's bleeding, and that can be handled at a regular MD's office or at Planned Parenthood itself.    If it makes you feel better to know, the exact same risks and potential complications for a surgical abortion are the ones I had for a uterine biopsy a couple of years ago....bleeding, infection, and possibly a puncture to the uterus itself.  The biopsy was done in my gyno's office without anaesthesia, using similar instruments as a surgical abortion.  The only reason surgical abortions are not performed in a regular doctor's office, like my biopsy was, is the political environment surrounding abortion!  Go to Planned Parenthood with your stepsister and just ask to sit in the waiting room while she talks to people there.  The folks at PP are honest and professional and they're not going to shame her or fill her head with lies and abuse."
TwoXChromosomes,3e1rfb,flawlessqueen,2,Tue Jul 21 18:22:57 2015 UTC,"All medical procedures come with risks, the best you can do is find an expert when you need a procedure (which you have done).  Sometimes, researching the procedure can do more harm than good, which I suspect may be part of the reason it took so long for your sister to confide in you.  But PP helps women in your sister's situation ALL of the time, including people you would least expect, and chances are that you know some of them yourself.  They're the best for the job and they are very good at what they do.  Don't worry about suspicions that you are the baby-daddy.  I just wanted to warn you in case it happens.  Chances are they won't ask you anyway, but they will want to hear her whole story directly from her, in private.    This is pretty standard protocol for reproductive health visits. Whether you're 14 or 40, if you are a woman, you get asked very direct questions, in private, about domestic abuse, and they are well trained to accurately evaluate patient response to these questions. (It's almost always a negative, but I imagine it must be such a hopeful moment for the few that answer positively.)  Your best bet to get the boyfriend to come along with you would be to come up with a backstory about something he would typically do away from the house.  (I'm useless, in that regard. See relevant username.) Someone else may have a more concrete suggestion, but remember, the less people who know, the better.    I'm not sure how many visits to PP it will take to get this resolved, but if you have a choice of only one, IMO, the boyfriend should go with you to the first visit.    Keep in mind, they will probably want to test both of them for STDs, also, even if it seems obvious that they are each others first and only partners.  Again, not a big deal, it's just part of their job.  Go with it.  It's going to be okay. Help is at hand. Hang in there."
TwoXChromosomes,3e1rfb,atom_kiti,5,Tue Jul 21 18:52:53 2015 UTC,"She needs to see a doctor immediately. It's dangerous for both not to. And she needs to know and understand all her options! And she needs to be educated on whats happening to her body. She's young and scared but she's pregnant. She's unfortunately going to have to make some very grown up decisions and live with them. Whether it's to be a mom, give up her baby for adoption, or abortion. But truth be told it's hard to make those decisions if you are not entirely sure what that means. She has a bit of time, she needs to be honest and people need to be honest with her."

Its a bad idea for a lot of reasons, including that its wrong and that it won't affect anything that happens except people might pressure her to report the non-rape (they shouldn't, but they might). Everyone at a PP is there because they believe in that mission and they will be sympathetic. They are not there to judge her.   A note about the judging: You (a 19 year old dude) are taking a fourteen year old girl for an abortion. There might be questions within there or funny looks. Please a) don't stress them immediately and b) know that the funny looks are because they want to protect your step sister and they don't know you.

I understand, and the way you put it, does help me feel at ease. I can begin to see why that would look suspicious from someone else's perspective, but she is my step sister, I like to think of her as my biological sister because we have grown close. To be honest, it would be pretty offensive to have someone believe it's me, but I understand and you are right. They are only trying to protect my little sister.

I feel that tampons are more or less a necessity, and should cost very little, but things like makeup and hairspray are all luxury items, women don't need to buy them unless they want to.

TwoXChromosomes,3dzsyk,LemurPants,91,Tue Jul 21 01:26:54 2015 UTC,"PSA moment for women reading this: If your cramps are so unbearable that drowning yourself in ginger (figuratively) is your best hope, I also want to recommend you look into the symptoms of endometriosis. Its most common symptom is bad cramps! Other pain-related symptoms (which you don't necessarily need to have! Just may have) include (but are not limited to!) pelvic pain throughout the month, pain with intercourse, pain with bowel movements, pain tied to urination... ect. Contrary to persistent misconceptions, period pain is not normal. Some minor discomfort is more normal, but if you're really, really, in pain to the point it's interfering with your life? That's more likely a disorder. Endometriosis is a really common cause - ~1 out of 10 women has it, though most go undiagnosed for a long time.   Endometriosis is a progressive disease, meaning it gets worse with time. The endo can grow and spread, and in some cases interfere with your fertility (it's one of the most common causes of fertility issues). In most cases it does not show up in a standard pelvic exam, ultrasound, or other related scans - these procedures can only really rule out other common causes of pelvic pain, they cannot exclude endometriosis. But when it is strongly suspected, a minimally-invasive surgical procedure called a laproscopy can be performed to both visually confirm the endometriosis and then remove the lesions causing the pain. Most women's symptoms significantly improve just after this procedure! But there are further treatment options. Also, staying on birth control post-procedure can prevent the endometriosis from growing/spreading and thus reoccurring or otherwise getting worse. If you, after doing a little bit of reading on the symptoms of endometriosis, think you may have it, i strongly strongly strongly recommend getting a consultation with a specialist in endometriosis for an evaluation. You can be saving both your current and your future self a lot of suffering!  Not that ginger is a bad idea! If it helps, it helps. Just that if the underlying issue is endometriosis, it's arguably best to get the best treatment possible, you know?"

TwoXChromosomes,3e2tvh,continuousQ,3,Tue Jul 21 15:32:55 2015 UTC,"Y'all are lying....   Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco reviewed dozens of studies and medical reports and said the data indicate that fetuses likely are incapable of feeling pain until around the seventh month of pregnancy, when they are about 28 weeks old..    From the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists:   “The report concludes that fetuses under 24 weeks must be pain-free, because at that age the wiring doesn’t exist to send pain signals from nerves around the body to the cortex, the area of the brain where pain is experienced. At which later point such connections form is unknown, so analgesia should still be considered after 24 weeks, the RCOG says.”   And yet another study here:   Fetal awareness of noxious stimuli requires functional thalamocortical connections. Thalamocortical fibers begin appearing between 23 to 30 weeks’ gestational age, while electroencephalography suggests the capacity for functional pain perception in preterm neonates probably does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks.   So no, fetuses do not feel pain at 8 weeks. That's a lie pushed solely by anti choice groups and people."
TwoXChromosomes,3e2tvh,JerryShrimpsticks,-4,Tue Jul 21 17:23:12 2015 UTC,"Pro-choice is about more than whether or not a fetus can feel pain. Even if it was a fully developed miniature adult inside there, it would be about one person occupying another person's body, relying on being welcome.  But highly developed at 8 weeks? What's your basis for that? I would think that if it was highly developed at 8 weeks, the pregnancy wouldn't last 40."

Obviously the mom is upset that the daughter is having sex at all, but the daughter feels like she should get more credit for doing it safely.

It took every ounce of self control I had not to flip-the-fuck-out. I managed, because I know I have taught her well and if I outright lost my shit, she'd probably be very hesitant to share anything like that with me again. If she would even attempt to again. Of course the way she told me could have been timed a little better.  She's on birth control, she knows about condoms, she knows about STDs because we've had multiple conversations about them. I've educated her about all of this.  But...  She's still my little girl. I'm a single dad. I've raised this child since birth. I've put all my effort into making sure she has everything she needs and wants. It's just a shock to actually realize that the sex is happening.  It's absolutely nothing she did wrong. It's all me. I now have to deal with the fact that I have a kid old enough to procreate. That's a shock. I was raised Catholic, abstinence only (that worked out, say hi to my daughter), sex was shamed and God forbid if you touch yourself, straight to hell with you. So I started falling into that old routine, which I quickly corrected myself on. That whole talk where she informed me she was sexually active lingered with me for a few days...I seriously had trouble with it.  So I had this mental image of my daughter being ""different"" before she told me that. But then rational me came back to reality and she isn't any different, it was going to happen. I knew it was going to happen that's the reason I talked to her about everything she wanted to know. I prepared her for it, I did the right thing.  My little girl is growing up and there isn't a damned thing I can do about it, except guide her, and teach her to think rationally and critically. I have two choices, accept that she's growing into an intelligent and sexually active woman, or lose her respect and damage our relationship. Acceptance seems like the better option.  The only big difference between your mom and I is I am not insensitive or inconsiderate to her. She comes to me with everything, because I listen to everything she has to say. It's just me and her, she really has no one else to go to.  Either way, after a while, your mom will more than likely get over it. Give her some time. It really does take a few days to get over that initial shock.  You're not doing anything wrong, continue to be safe."

I ended up yelling - in front of a waiting room full of people - 'if I'm pregnant, call the media, because I'm the next Virgin Mary!'    The point is, many moms, no matter how cool normally (and especially if not so cool usually) are going to be a bit freaked out by their teenager having sex. You're her baby, but now you're not.    It might be worth having a conversation with her about it in a couple days when you've both cooled down.

It's hard for parents to see their children growing up but at the same time it's their job to make sure you do just that. This can create some conflicting feelings. She loves you.

I would guess your mother thinks her stance on your sexuality is protecting you but in all reality she's projecting her ideas of purity upon you.  Some parents don't realize you're a separate human being from them and that they need to decide on a case by case basis when to stop controlling different aspects of your life.  The best parents let go of the right things while they can still help evaluate your decisions.  Sheltered youths when they finally slip away to college or move out can very easily turn into party monsters when faced with freedom of choice if they have never been given any."
TwoXChromosomes,3e06cm,ironsprite,5,Tue Jul 21 08:10:41 2015 UTC,"Awe :'(. This is a pretty common occurrence.  Personally, I remember talking to my mom on the phone during my freshman year of college, and her figuring out my boyfriend had been sleeping over in my dorm. She flipped out of course, saying my name with a combination of shock and shame, but my response was something along the lines of ""I am in a healthy relationship that makes me feel happy, safe, and fulfilled. That's the most important thing to me. And as somebody who loves me and cares about me, I would think that you would care about my emotional health and happiness firstmost, too."" I was, of course, having safe sex, and i stressed that as well. It took her some time to open up to the thought of me having sex - part of it is probably her roman catholic upbringing. But even she came around with time. Hopefully, your mom will too. Most do.  Try to realize that it says a lot more about your mother than you. Your mom might be upset by the thought of you having sex for a myriad of reasons. She might believe that you're not ""ready"" for it - but she's not exactly the one who gets to make that call, and for better or worse, it's been made. She might be trying to dissuade you from sex, no matter how harshly, because she believes it a threat to you and is trying to protect you in some way (even if it doesn't make sense to you, it makes sense to her). Maybe she's scared of you getting STI's, knocked up, or heartbroken. She might have trouble seeing you as mature enough for it - but realize that she's full of memories of you as a toddler, so it's hard for her to really see you as a grown women now, and some of the reaction might just be her subconscious realization that you really are mature and no longer her ""baby"" in the same way anymore. And if she possesses any of those icky images of sex as something that ""ruins"" a woman, remember too that she's suffered her own guilt about that. Empathize a bit if you can - no matter what hateful or hurtful things she might sling at you, if she truly believes those sort of things about sex, then realize that those things have weighed on her as well, all her life. That she's trying to shame you for what she herself was probably shamed for too or is ashamed of.  People have faults. You mother will likely love you even if she thinks having sex at your age is one of yours. And despite her faults in reacting to this situation, you'll likely love her back, too. It might be rough for a while until she really works through her own emotions (with or without you), but it will pass. She might just see how mature you are by how you handle her reactions, too :)."

My mom shamed me about the rape when she found out and when I started having sex that I actually wanted she shamed me for that too.   I am now grown, live on my own, and have a steady boyfriend (we live together). If sex was to ever be brought up (why would it be though?) I can guarantee she would have the same reaction she had when I was a teenager. She likes to pretend my boyfriend doesn't exist and I think it's for this reason. Since we live together we might be, gasp, having sex! My whole life she wasn't supportive of anything she couldn't control. My sex life being one of those things. She always had a special distaste for me as opposed to my younger siblings (ages 13, 10, and 2) because I was much older and therefore more strong-willed.

I don't know what she expected, we never had an open line of communication in our relationship.  She died very unexpectedly two years ago.

I would be more worried if you were 14/15 or so, and would understand those comments more, but really, you're almost a legal adult, and are clearly capable of being mature, sensible, and safe, so I think you're right to be annoyed at her reaction but I think you've handled it very well - and yes, robexib is right, maybe all you can do at this point is be discreet about it, but know that your mother is over reacting."

I texted my mom and she totally flipped- saying that I didn't need it and it was going to tempt me into getting myself into situations just by being on it, I just had to reassure her that it was my life and my decision and that I had sex then at least I was taking all the precautions I could to avoid a pregnancy at a young age (she's adopted and her birth mother had her very young so that hit home). At the end of the day you're in love and you trust him and yourself and that's all that I think matters- you're being safe and it's hard for her to accept you growing up im sure, but that's life. Just help her understand that it's your decision and your safety is important to you so that's why you have confoms and the pill, plus condoms are way cheaper than plan b or a baby."

TwoXChromosomes,3e06cm,staple-salad,2,Tue Jul 21 01:07:04 2015 UTC,"I hate when parents have unreasonable reactions to confirmation of the fact that their children have reached the age of sexual maturity.  However, since your Mom knew you were on the pill and was also aware of the fact that you've had a boyfriend for quite some time, she would have to be delusional to think that there was no possibility that you were sexually active.  I suspect some of her reaction may actually be more about her, and she may not even realize it.  Out of love and respect for your Mom, you should try to figure out why she had this reaction.  Her thoughts and feelings about this are important, even if yours are different.  Do what you can to have an open, rational discussion with her about finding that wrapper.  Be calm and matter-of-fact, but don't be apologetic or make excuses, as the maturity you show in this discussion is a direct reflection on your readiness to be sexually active.    Good luck!"

Even if my daughter had been 17 I still would've flipped.  You just don't think they're ready for the responsibility that comes with it.  It took me several hours to be really proud that she was being safe.  That really does make a difference, but it's still a tough thing to deal with as a parent.  I still hated that she was sexually active, even though I liked the boy. And I don't have boys, but I really don't think it would have been any different if it had been a son. I would also suggest, if you can't talk to your mom about sensitive issues, find another adult that you feel comfortable talking to, an aunt, friend's mom, someone.  It's important to have someone you feel safe talking to.   she makes me feel that I'm a delicate, white flower who needs to stay pure to hold my worth   That's because to her you ARE a delicate, white flower who needs to stay pure.  Not to hold your worth, but just because you're her baby and that's how she sees you.

Usually, this age is about 18, and out of high school - preferably not living with parents. While there are many awesome teenage and young mothers and fathers out there, I think a lot of people also know teenagers and emotionally immature adults who treat their kids like fashion accessories that they can dump on other relatives when they aren't cute anymore, which also taints perception of teenagers having kids. It's not fair, but a lot of people have this perception. Given that no birth control is foolproof and you can't force someone to have or not have an abortion, I think many parents fear becoming a parent AGAIN to their teenagers child.  That said, most people start having sex around age 16, and I think it would be more beneficial to us as a society to accept that and plan for it - for better or worse.

We're not even that religious.   Honestly, just don't take it personally. I know it's hard, and my mom's outburst offended me too at first.

It's kind of weird (and for me it felt hurtful) to have your parent care so much about the simple fact that you're having sex. After we get so much sex education about safety, it's weird to have your head ripped off for actually doing it, especially by the person who spent your whole life making you wear helmets and seatbelts. My mom did the sneaking thing too, and it made it really hard for me to trust her and feel comfortable approaching her when I needed a mom.   Oddly enough, ten years later, my mom is happily lecturing me on using contraception with my live-in boyfriend. Of course, now we're both too tired to actually have sex...  I know you know, but in case you need to hear it again: you're doing the right thing by using condoms and it's 100% okay that you're having sex"

Like sorry mom, next time I'll have an STD? I think that in her mind getting tested means I must have been doing something risky. Especially because my mom is older - if your mom is older too, she might see the condom as a sign that you are not in a monogamous relationship with someone you trust. I think older generations have a stigma about stuff like that, they assume that if you need safe sex materials you must be doing something dangerous. It's pretty backwards thinking, but it's there.   Do you think it would help if you emphasized with your mom that you are using condoms to be more safe with your loving trustworthy partner?"
TwoXChromosomes,3e06cm,Lilpinecone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:17:05 2015 UTC,"As a mom and a sister with a teenage brother - she's honestly probably scared. Realizing that your children are growing up is very hard. She also probably wants to protect you from being hurt in any way, emotionally or physically. Mom's can be overprotective just because they love us so much. I recommend asking her to sit and talk with you about it. Once I became open with my mother about sex our relationship vastly improved. Yes she was angry, but I know it was out of love and fear for me. I am a very sex positive person, but I'm sure that when my son begins having sex it will be upsetting to me - simply because it means he's growing up and not my baby anymore.   Lastly - good for you for being safe! Good luck :)"
TwoXChromosomes,3e06cm,chibiakutenshi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:28:57 2015 UTC,"Being the parent of a teenage girl who was also a teenage girl once... I get mom's knee-jerk reaction. No matter how grown-up a daughter is, she will always be the mom's baby. From the first forehead kiss, to the last. BUT upon further inflection or maybe someone else pointing it out she should realize that she raised you to do things as safely as you can and that you need some boundaries.     As a side note, I was looking for the pool key in my daughter's room while she is away at dad's for the summer. Pool key replacements are $100 so we searched high and low for that bad boy. I told her I went through her drawers and clothing pockets but didn't find the key. She knows that I threw away all the half eaten junk food and soda bottles that I found tucked away. I did not, however, say a fucking word about the condoms in various places in her room. As the parent that she does open up to, we discussed sex and 'readiness'. How sex is a healthy expression of affection, consent is always #1, and I was honest. I would prefer that she wait until she is absolutely 100% ready, with someone that will respect her, and that she does so as safely as she can. I don't think she is actually having sex yet. I think she's just super prepared for herself and anyone that asks for a rubber. She asked if she could go on BC to regulate her period and in preparation for when she is 'ready' next year.     If I could impart some not-your-mom motherly advice - Give your mom the benefit of the doubt on being overprotective - that's kinda her job, but also remind her that you're on birth control, being safe, and she did a great job raising you. You're making well thought out decisions and you love her. It will smooth things over and make you sound as mature as possible.      Purity is an illusion. Slut shaming is not something we condone. Healthy choices during sex at 17 is rare. Good for you!"

And now she has a possible STD and can't even talk to her own mother about it.  Her mother doesn't even want to talk about the subject, let alone about any birth control methods or anything.

You're 17, definitely capable of making that decision for yourself and you're being safe (which is hugely important)!   I don't know why others seem to normalize your mom's reaction, granted I don't have kids but I think sex is a healthy part of relationships and you should be allowed to have it. Her sneaking around seems pretty controlling too, I guess unless she has reason to believe you're using drugs or something. Good luck talking to her!"

Not the 'you're going to hell for that' kind but more the 'you have disappointed me and god' kind.  Meanwhile I've got friends (and an ex) who discuss that openly with their folks and it's just another day at the office. That was an awkward dinner with the girlfriend's parents...   on a related note, if you know someone has an upbringing where things like sex are taboo topics, save them some embarrassment (and stress) and have that discussion without them around. they are constantly waiting for the incoming fire and brimstone s***-nado."

Otherwise, enjoy the roof over your head, free food, health insurance, etc etc etc.  Yea, that's right - passive-aggressively complain about your mother to strangers on the internet.

I grew up in a hugely abusive and controlling household and that mentality really shook me up. Stability is a really important thing for parents to teach their kids and this idea that if they don't like it they can leave sets a really bad precedent. In my house this ""my house, my rules"" thing was tossed around from everything to smoking cigarettes to eating bacon (for no reason other than my dad thought it smelled weird and didn't want it in the house).   Sex positive parents are a lot less likely than repressive ones to become early grandparents. And kids WILL find a way to do what they need to do, whether that's under ""your roof"" or in some sketchy park somewhere. Taking away that safe haven for them is only detrimental, and doing it because you want a 17 year old to be pure is nothing short of delusional. A 3-year relationship will have a sexual aspect to it, and shaming a young person for it can really warp her self-image and her mentality toward sex.   Times have changed. Refusing to change with them is almost universally looked down upon."

It took me awhile after my assault to feel good doing stuff with a guy again. I started dating a guy about a year after it happened when I still had not really addressed it or thought about it. I was kind of ignoring it. A few months into our relationship the dam finally broke and I started having nightmares and panic attacks and it was awful. My bf was supportive and most non-sex stuff with him made me feel better and didn't remind me of my assault. For sex though, I asked him to ask me if he could every time we had sex. It's been three years since then and he still always asks but now it's more sexy. Like, ""may I?"" The fact that I'm reassured that we both are consenting verbally totally relaxes me and lets us both enjoy it."

That book was her recommendation. It helped me immensely. I hope you can get a copy and read it. In fact, I strongly suggest you do. I insist. Please, please, please, get that book and read it.

My ex-wife was raped in college, and she still had flashbacks 20 years later.  It terrified and shamed me whenever I accidentally triggered one of those flashbacks, when all I was feeling was love and affection, and some asshole had ruined that for me and her years before.  But she and I worked on it, and worked on ways around it.  My mother and my sister were both raped, they worked around and over it, and still have their weird times.  Which is a roundabout introduction to this: if you have a flashback or a setback, remember that its a temporary thing - that you are still you, you still own your power.  And I wish you all the happiness in the world, because you (and everyone else!) deserves it.

I struggled with dealing with it a lot that semester because for the past 2 years I had just ignored it. So when I finally came to terms with what had happened, it was extremely difficult because I had bottled it up for so long. Thankfully, I was lucky enough to have my SO there for me whenever I was having a hard time. Honestly, it can be the smallest things that set off flashbacks but its also the smallest things that can help me out so much. I went to a candle light vigil for survivors of sexual assault and had a complete breakdown and talked to a counselor for the first time.

She said seeing him brought triggers on let alone the ones that come out of the blue or moments of being scared. Maybe you think she not looking out for her friend but she having a hard time looking out for herself and try to heal. Please take that in consideration. It might mean the world to the victim for understanding that it's ok to be selfish and keep to self especially if she can't even walk out the front door without being scared .

TwoXChromosomes,3dx0vm,Laddvocare,4,Mon Jul 20 15:42:57 2015 UTC,"Congratulations!!!  I don't mean that sarcastically or anything. I genuinely am proud of and happy for you because this is an awesome step in your healing.  Last week I started reading a book called The Sexual Healing Journey. I've realized that in the past two years I've had effects on my sex life from the most recent case of sexual abuse, and it's been really upsetting me that it hasn't gotten any better, but I also haven't been ready for therapy (well, I tried once and then, unrelated, suddenly moved across the country a month later...). I'm only in chapter 4, but the book has already helped me realize the problems I'm having all tie back to abuse from my pre-teen years, and that it's all connected. It's difficult to read, but it seems really helpful. So if you're interested in a resource to help you work through your fears and improve without having to talk to someone, I strongly recommend it! I found it because of an open letter that was posted on this sub weekend before last that referenced it.  Link if you're interested. (And assuming I can get links right from mobile.)  Good luck and I wish you the best in continuing to heal."

TwoXChromosomes,3dx0vm,dwiggitypoo,4,Mon Jul 20 16:51:13 2015 UTC,"I'm so happy you're healing.   I was in a 2 year relationship when I was abused and sexually violated in college. It caused me to completely retreat from the world and not trust others.   But something happened when I went to laser tag with some friends and ended up meeting an amazing guy. Things progressed pretty quickly and we ended up dating. He made me feel safe, but he challenged me. He took the patience to learn about my past and chose to support me on my journey of healing. Two years later, we're so happy in all aspects of our relationship, including sexually and romantically. It wasn't always easy for either of us, but I'm so thankful to have found a support system. I knew from that first kiss we shared that things were different.   I don't know if you intend to pursue a relationship with the man you met, but if you do, I hope it's everything you dream of and more. I've always thought that the trials I went through only happened to make me appreciate the love I have now."

TwoXChromosomes,3dx0vm,byefatlecia,4,Mon Jul 20 17:05:52 2015 UTC,I had just started my relationship with my current SO when I was assaulted. I was terrified he was going to leave me. I couldn't even look at him because I was afraid. He has been there through all of my nightmares and panic attacks. After a couple weeks he held me and kissed me. That moment was one of the most needed in my life. Suddenly I felt safe and in control. We have been through a lot and he continues to gently push me when I want to hide and he is always by me when I need him too. I am so happy to see another find a moment like I have. May life continue wonderfully for you and I hope your healing continues.

I still get anxious in certain situations with my boyfriend, but things are really getting better. I had an ex that would always tickle me or aggressively kiss me in a way that he thought was cute and he would keep it up even when I asked him to stop. It sort of messed with my head and ended up making my flashbacks worse. I remember freaking out on him and telling him that if he couldn't respect me saying ""no"" or ""stop"" with the little things, how could I trust that he would respect it in other situations? My current bf is amazing and we've talked about those things. He asks me silly things just so I can practice saying no and he respects my answer every time. He's helping me feel comfortable again by showing me that those words still have power :)"

For some reason i feel like i just dont deserve it, or like its something i shouldn't be doing, i wish i could have a nice sexually-healing experience like this, but not to draw sympathy from ANYONE (seriously) i really don't know if i will ever find that girl who will makes me feel happy and at ease with myself again, it just seems like they always have something wrong with me. I was beaming with excitement when i was reading this, i'm so happy to hear that you can start opening up again because although i don't know you i can tell you're an outstanding person, because from experience it takes a strong person to go out of their comfort zone like that.

I'm a survivor and it was a longggggggggg time before I was comfortable with anyone touching my breasts including long term boyfriends. I can finally say that I'm comfortable with my fiancé touching, caressing, kissing my breasts (and I am enjoying it as well.) He has to make eye contact first so I'm prepared to relax about it and I'm going to be working on this in therapy but it's a huge step in my life.   You are making progress very quickly and that's so awesome and you are an example of our strength and resilience!  I'm so upset that someone hurt you. I don't understand how any sane human hurts another human like that... It blows my mind. Sexuality is part of our souls and nobody should even desire to ruin that for even a second.

It made me so anxious and nauseous. Towards the end of the ""relationship"" with, we'll call him Horseface, everything I had apparently repressed began floating towards the top.  The biggest revelation was when I had my first panic attack in front of my current boyfriend and I had always felt my experiences were so invalid because other people have been through worse than me. But after I said it aloud for the first time, I no longer feel that way and know what happened to me was in no way my fault and I'm much better."

TwoXChromosomes,3dx0vm,fusnoduh,3,Mon Jul 20 23:24:48 2015 UTC,"I'm so happy for you!   This is probably going to be super long because I've never actually written this out before. I've never had anyone to relate to on this subject before Reddit.   I was molested at 9 and assaulted at 19. Knew the first one, the second one was a stranger. I never dealt with the first one, so when the second encounter happened, it all came to the surface and I just fell apart.   It's been 5 years, and in all of my life, I haven't kissed anyone or done anything beyond that because I wanted to, and I've never had a boyfriend. Well, until now.  I met a guy about 3 months ago. It was online, so I was extra cautious. I've always had my guard up. I didn't like being touched or being alone with any guy. It just made me uneasy.   Anyway, I found out that I actually shared some mutual friends with this guy I met online. We hung out a few times in a group. He noticed I was standoffish. I eventually told him (over text) everything that happened and why I am the way I am. He was so sweet and understanding and respectful and I cried because holy shit, this guy seemed to actually care.   He tried to kiss me about 3 weeks ago after I told him to go for it. I backed up and covered my mouth and then realized what I did and started laughing. He laughed and hugged me and that was it.   Two weeks ago he asked me to be his girlfriend. And, hell yeah!    Two days later, my grandma passed away. He was there for me. A few days before the funeral, he met me at the mall when I was looking for something nice to wear. Her funeral was exactly one week after he asked me to be his girlfriend, and he was at my house bright and early that morning to be there with me through the day.   I haven't seen him since (new job for him, family stuff for me), and we still have never kissed. I want to so bad, but I'm so nervous. And he's been so great about everything. The past three months has been so great, and this feeling is a completely new one for me. I've never really understood how people could be so open with each other, but now I get it.   Reading your story made me so happy. And you're so strong. And it gives me hope that I'll feel normal soon, too :)  TL;DR Just because some people are awful doesn't mean all people suck. OP is cool."

TwoXChromosomes,3dx0vm,dumblewhore93,2,Tue Jul 21 00:31:59 2015 UTC,This is really wonderful to hear I am still struggling with my PTSD and trying to trust people. I've tried to have sex with different guys to prove to myself that I'm over it but it ended up being distant and cold and I felt really guilty afterward. I don't know if I will ever trust anyone again but it's nice to read about other people doing so.
TwoXChromosomes,3dx0vm,Rosenblattca,2,Tue Jul 21 00:53:29 2015 UTC,"I had a boyfriend when I was raped at a college party (my bf didn't do the attack, obviously; it was an acquaintance). I kind of had an opposite reaction from you: I wanted to have sex with my boyfriend all the time. It made me forget what the attack felt like. I clung on to him to help me get over it. I had never been clingy, but I started to get possessive, because I needed him. He was great, and put up with my neuroses.  It's weird, too: I didn't tell him about the attack until we broke up, and were talking about things we never said. It wasn't that I didn't trust him, it was just easier to pretend it never happened. I wish I had. Maybe we would still be together if he understood why I acted so crazy sometimes."
TwoXChromosomes,3dx0vm,_TimeParadox,2,Tue Jul 21 00:55:21 2015 UTC,"I'll start off by saying I've lurked Reddit for so long but never made an account but I have now because of your post because it made me so happy. I recently watched a documentary and this girl gave a story about how she was sexually assaulted and she felt like she could never be with another guy sexually every again because she felt ruined.  I couldn't even imagine or relate to that in any way, shape or form.  Reading your post made me really happy, and it made me think of the girl in that documentary and I can only hope the same has happened or will happen to her, because love is a truly amazing thing.  But if I may ask, why don't you expect much to come from it?  Something about this guy made you feel comfortable again.  He didn't make you feel anxious or scared, so why not try and see where it goes from there?  If you like kissing again, and he made you like it, maybe see where it goes?  You never know where it will lead.  :)  The last thing I have to say (by the way, I'm not subject matter in any of this so please take it all with a grain of salt) is even if you don't go to a therapist, talk to someone.  Like I said, I could not imagine what you've gone through, but I can't see keeping it locked up to do any good.  There are websites out there and anonomyous people who have gone through similar things that you can talk to.  Sometimes a therapist isn't the greatest because you really need to just talk to someone who has been in a similar situation.  Or at least someone to just dedicate their time to truly listen to you, without the thought of getting paid after one hour.  One again, thank you for sharing this.  It's boosted my mood and I'm so happy for you."

When I was raped at 16 by my boyfriend at the time (maybe because of how I felt after already being raped) I didn't want any sexual interaction, especially from him.   When I went to college and was raped at 18 I said fuck it and had sex with everybody. But I also met my SO at college. Started out as a hook-up, developed into something more. Our first kiss was great, it wasn't like a hook-up kiss at all. I genuinely wanted a relationship from him, but I didn't know how to go about it because I already had the reputation of sleeping with everybody. So I slept with him and hoped that he would like me. I was prepared for him to not. But he did. It's been almost 2 years now.   I'm so happy you feel good again. I hope things just keep getting better and better for you. :)"

TwoXChromosomes,3dx0vm,NotTooDeep,6,Mon Jul 20 21:53:29 2015 UTC,"Think about all of the positive connotations around 'survive'.  The word isn't perfect to describe the healing process over the long term, but it is absolutely perfect near the time of the event.  It's not hyperbolic to save 'I survived assault' when you're still healing from the event.  You used to suffer from an eating disorder (later comment of yours).  'Suffer' is the perfect word for framing your physical and mental well being during the disorder.  Food had no intent in your suffering.  Consider that sexual assault is never about having good sex; it's about exerting power over someone else, which strips the person being assaulted of their power of choice, and it can end up in death.  The risk of death is always there in sexual assault because it can and does happen.  The victim of an assault either dies or survives.  Considering your username, I'll add that while some partners enjoy sex as a sporting event, and more power to them, sexual assault is not a game.  A better place to post your question would have been ELI5, but good on you for asking it.  You learned something by posting it.  I hope my answer satisfies your need to understand."

TwoXChromosomes,3dx0vm,Mbross94,6,Mon Jul 20 15:14:27 2015 UTC,"Well when you do get sexually assaulted, most of the time you lose a part of yourself. It takes a while to get it back. So in a way yes they become survivors. Because it screws with your head. So becoming a survivor means that you survived from that lifetime of pain and mental abuse that you would give yourself. Of course you will never forget it. But there becomes a time where you choose to let it go. Hence surviving."
TwoXChromosomes,3dx0vm,ThatWalkingDisaster,5,Mon Jul 20 14:33:23 2015 UTC,Because there is a difference between being a victim and a survivor.  A survivor owns what happened to them and works for a better future.

Your response to the huge ""what if he becomes like them"" is to finish school as quickly as possible and limit his ability to interact with his family?  News flash: as a person, you cannot (nor do you have the right to) control who your boyfriend interacts with. Yes, you can voice your opinion, but if the genders were reversed and your boyfriend was limiting your contact with your family, it would be labelled as an abusive, controlling relationship.  Grow up and realize your boyfriend is an adult. He is free to make choices for himself. If he makes choices/changes you do not approve of, you are free to leave and find companionship with someone more compatible; but you do NOT have the right to control contact with his family out of an irrational fear of what he ""might"" become."

I do not recommend voicing your  concern that he will become like them because any reasonable person would get pretty pissed. Just mention the specific things that bother you.

I don't really have much advice, but I kind of had to come off lurker status to back you up. It feels terrible.

I had two girlfriends in high school, one of whom I routinely slept with. Only reason I don't have one now is because of how hard it is to find a woman who likes women who I also like when you're living in the South."
TwoXChromosomes,3e0fiw,bestsmithfam,13,Tue Jul 21 16:50:24 2015 UTC,I think this would be different if you were a man. I don't think anyone is suggesting a bisexual man involved with a woman could have sex with another man and it wouldn't be cheating. Lesbian sex is perceived differently. Just look at how many porn videos involve two women together versus two men. I don't think you'll ever see a heterosexual porn with two men together without a woman but many of them contain scenes of two women with no men.
TwoXChromosomes,3e0fiw,Numericaly7,6,Tue Jul 21 00:58:59 2015 UTC,"IIRC that was the big thing to overcome in the fight for gay rights.  Public opinion has always been much more positive toward lesbianism(ideally bi-sexualality)  than men being gay, because way less people find two dudes together to be erotic, and many find it gross.  Here's a Letterman clip from 93' that portrays this divide in public opinion especially back then."

When I tell people my GF is bi, I always hear: ""aww, you're so lucky. Nice! Does she make out with girls?"" And stuff like that. It's very frustrating. However, that being said, her cheating on me with a girl seems somehow less bad than if it were a guy."

Still, one time a friend of mine came over and got plastered. I went to the restroom and she ended up drunkenly telling my boyfriend that she was attracted to me. (We thought she was still strait at the time. She still says she is, so I take her word for it.)  She got so embarrassed that she started to cry and he and I both set her up on the couch to sleep it off. A few days later I asked him ""If it were a guy that said/did that and not a girl, would you have let him stay?"" and he was like ""fuck no.""

I don't really date straight guys any more. It's not that there's anything wrong with having a straight scene but it comes with that required unpackaging of everything all the time. But I don't reasonably expect straight people to understand the romantic dynamics of being queer, they're going to approach everything through the straight lens and I don't have the energy to educate all the time anymore.

Told me about your fantasies based on bad lesbian porn.         d. Asked me to sleep with you and your boyfriend/girlfriend     e.

In point of fact, I'd be willing to bet that many, many people in your other situation - that being, a long distance relationship - get hints from friends and family that maybe they should be exploring other options. LDR's aren't as exotic as bisexuals, so yes, some of the hints will be subtler, and will come with a lot more pop-psychobabble prefacing so that the solicitor can continue thinking of themselves as a good person based on the prevailing societal standard."

This is a new fave!"".  It's kind of a difference between the sexes. Men are highly focused on the visual aspects of the act, whereas women tend to be more focused on the emotional aspects. I've seen frame for frame comparisons of manga with the exact same thing going on and the mens version is always more 'hardcore' and visually explicit.

In this way, the ""eye"" the porn is filmed for is often concerned with imagery over emotional content, and thus probably misses out on a lot of what women want in porn. Similar to the problem in straight porn with the extreme focus on female bodies."

It's because they don't have that dead look in their eyes, and the before/after interviews are nice (although, I have a feeling that you need to say good things to keep working there). There is also a lot of queer for women by women porn floating around. And forced orgasm porn is nice - because hey, orgasms. I can also relate what is going on on-screen (women using vibrator) to what I am doing (woman using vibrator)."

But I doubt the hijab would exist if the Quran didn't talk about women covering themselves and acting modest.  I feel very confused by what she writes and what the quran says."
TwoXChromosomes,3e2jcs,Nick-Cage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:12:49 2015 UTC,"Exactly. the whole ""omg hijabs aren't oppressive!!!"" argument ignores the entire history of why women were forced to wear one."

I went to a perfectly normal mosque in the middle of the wealthy suburbs where I live and don't get me wrong everyone was nice but they made the women pray behind the men because they believed the men would be too distracted from seeing women's butts while they pray.

I live in Australia so I've had a fair bit of exposure to their culture and I've gleaned a bit of knowledge from friends and acquaintances over time. To my understanding, growing a beard is their version of wearing a niquab. Furthermore, among other men, they are allowed to just cover from the navel down below their knees but, among women, they are expected to cover more of themselves in loose-fitting clothing.

TwoXChromosomes,3e2jcs,meguriau,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:33 2015 UTC,"Of course. As feminists, we cannot tell people what to do with their bodies, as that directly contradicts the principle of bodily autonomy that modern feminism seeks to achieve for all women.   However, I hope the wearers of these hijabs realize the history behind them and that they stem from telling women how to dress, which is also completely unfeminist.  Wearing a hijab just supports the patriarchial ideal of modesty that the Qu'ran seeks to enforce.  Just because you voluntarily submit to your own oppression doesn't make you any less oppressed than the women who don't have a choice."

TwoXChromosomes,3e1lw8,annelliot,10,Tue Jul 21 08:06:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, how much notice is she getting? Will her financial situation be affected? I would definitely be upset if I was living with someone and all of a sudden they were moving out, regardless of the reason.   Also, it goes both ways. I've known people in relationships who are so over the moon about their partner that they spend all their time with them. Really kills the friendship. Then, they break up and boom!

It's much easier to keep up friendships if you have 1 on 1 time, in my experience. Bring your boyfriend to group events, but be sure to have some quality fun time.   If that's not the case, then probably just jealousy on your friend's part."

I left as quickly as possible (also rents are going up, not down). It definitely worked out in the long rung but it was one of the most stressful things I've dealt with. We are friends, we are happy now, but damn it sucked. Just giving my perspective. I wasn't and am not single and I wasn't happy for her at the time, so there ya go."

I had a roommate of 4 years let me know that he was going to be moving out, due to relocating for work, and set up a plan for us both on how to go about it.  We were friends then and friends now.  I guess how the roommate goes about it is the determining factor?  Glad you two are friends now though. :)"

I'm happily coupled up, and I've noticed that my friends fell into two camps: those who carry on exactly the same and those who make a big deal about it in some way that negatively affects our friendship. I don't enjoy hanging out with those who fall into the latter group, but it doesn't mean I don't understand them.   When I was single and wasn't happy with myself I realise now that I was in the second group - I felt like I was being put aside. But when I was happier with myself and single I felt much more positive - friends being coupled up surely just ups the number of new people I'll meet, right?   So try not to see their reactions as a comment on your happiness, but rather as a sign that they are not as happy as they could be. Of course, this doesn't apply to everyone, obligatory 2X disclaimer."

TwoXChromosomes,3e1lw8,indomito,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:59:52 2015 UTC,"It might be that your friends are worried that you might be abandoning them.  I'm single, and have had close friends completely disappear after they've entered into a committed relationship.  I've tried to stay in touch, and messaged them with interesting anecdotes about my life, I try to organise meet ups, or a movie, or dinner, or some type of social catch-up, even phone calls. But I rarely hear back from them.  And then if/when their relationship falls apart, suddenly I get a phone call from them, wanting to catch up/vent/etc. I realise that entering a relationship can take a lot of time away from your previously lifestyle, but I'd like to think that there's still some room for other friends."
TwoXChromosomes,3e1lw8,Therealmattu,4,Tue Jul 21 08:49:00 2015 UTC,"As the permanently single friend, I'll second this one. At least as someone who can't have romantic involvement of any kind, it is terribly annoying to be friends with someone for a long time then someone else comes up and suddenly is The Most Important Person and everything he does matters more than what I've done, and every conversation steers back to him.   Trust me, she feels annoyed at you too. And it's best for you to talk this out and set boundaries before the friendship is ruined for good. My two closest friends are happily committed and we don't have issues because they know my boundaries, and I try to be involved with that part of their lives as much as I can bear, and that's it. No biggie. It's not impossible, but it can't be done if you think your friend is 100% wrong in this.  She probably isn't.  A good guideline is to think of your SO as a family member when it comes to talking about them around your friends. Yes, you are going to talk about your mother and your closest relatives because they are, too, a central part of your life, but you aren't going to coo at every cute thing they have done, are you?"
TwoXChromosomes,3e1lw8,MonkeyWrench3000,4,Tue Jul 21 16:17:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it applies here though as she said they have been dating for a couple years, so it isn't a new relationship.  She also said they wouldn't be moving in together until early next year, so she is giving quite a bit of notice for her roommate to find another lease partner.  If her friends are agitated by her mentioning a partner she has been with for over two years then I think they have a very different issue to deal with."

I know, easier said than done. But think of if this were your son. Your mentality wouldn't be how disgusting and horrible and fat he is, but something like he's a wonderful person with great things going for him, and he just needs XYZ to make him even better.

I don't know if your issues were like mine, but:  With all the other problems in your life, how can you possibly focus on that problem?  Man, I am getting fat. I hate that I'm fat, why can't I find motivation to get rid of it?  And so the cycle repeats.  So here's a few things that motivated/worked for me:   There's no such thing as a reward for a workout. Drink your protein shake/salad and enjoy it. In fact, it should feel worse that you're giving up everything you sweat for with just some simple fatty foods. Pay money for a trainer/gym. Now this sounds ridiculous given money issues, but I can't stress how much that THIS WILL PAY FORWARD in the long run. Why you ask? Because if you had money issues and in general, like money, then you are going to motivate yourself to use your money effectively. Essentially, you're forcing yourself to go because you already paid for it and no one likes wasting money. Side Note : Interestingly enough, I had a gym membership for like $20/month. While I motivated myself to go, I did find moments of me thinking, ""Eh, what's $20."" I caught myself and went for a more expensive gym. That sounds utterly ridiculous, sure, but effective? Yes. Decide to give up one thing in your life. Be it chocolate, sugar, salt, etc and stick with it. Don't ever assume you can go cold turkey and be healthy. That's unrealistic and lacks real staying power in the long run.  On that note, go on a diet. A diet is not something you do for a couple weeks and eat normally again. In nutrition, diet is the sum of food consumed by a person or other organism. Remember that. Whatever you choose to diet (i.e. don't do fad diets but /r/keto is perfectly sensible, just really hard to do.), do start very incrementally so you can go towards a goal. For example, I choose not to eat fried foods, soda, and try to cut out fats when possible.  /u/carlinha1289 had a good point. Stick with one form a cardio workout. Be it swimming, cycling, running, elliptical, etc.   A lot of people had great ideas here."
TwoXChromosomes,3dzezf,POTUS_Washington,7,Mon Jul 20 21:51:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to give you advice on losing weight because I've bounced back and forth quite a bit myself. I'm still figuring out what works for me and I honestly think it's something different for everyone. What I will tell you is that shaming yourself won't help. Focus on being happy and healthy. Focus on what makes you feel better as a person. Don't make weight loss your goal exactly. Make it something like being healthy, being able to run x amount of time, lift x amount of weight, incorporating more vegetables, planning your meals for the week. If you choose to indulge enjoy it! For me this means that instead of buying a six dollar bag of cheap candy I buy one six dollar chocolate bar that's really freaking good. It means I get up and work out every morning because I start my day feeling accomplished,  I have more energy , and I make healthier choices so I don't counteract the hard work I just put in. It means getting in touch with my body and figuring out what foods leave me feeling satisfied and which ones leave me hungry or with cravings. It means buying clothes that fit now so I still feel attractive. Most importantly it means telling that ugly voice in my head to stfu. Of course I'm not perfect in this and I'm not saying it's easy but honestly, the times I'm nice to myself, the times I'm doing this are when I lose weight or at least maintain. The times I'm shaming myself and hating the ""bad""'choices, those are the times I gain, those are the times I resent trying to lose weight.Those are the times I get discouraged.  Sorry for any mistakes as I'm on my phone right now!"

TwoXChromosomes,3dzezf,vinylpanx,7,Mon Jul 20 22:02:30 2015 UTC,"I'm going to suggest seeing a dietician rather than a nutritionist...simply because the latter is not regulated, while dieticians are. Maybe speak to your family doctor and I'm sure they will be able to point you in the right direction for services to help you along. Going through your doctor may also permit some of it (if not all - I'm not American so not sure) to be covered. Don't get caught up in spending a lot of money, you don't need to. Focus on your relationship with food and your self esteem, focus on the roots of the problem.Your physique is made in the kitchen and though exercise has wonderful benefits it is not the means for weight loss.  You also don't need special diets, unless it is something you want. You should look at this as a lifestyle change and not a short term diet. Do something you can maintain forever, not something that will work for a few months and then it becomes too restricting. I lost 30 since March, I did not once go low carb or low fat. There is nothing wrong with moderation and having reasonable portions (actually going by the recommended serving size)."

TwoXChromosomes,3dzezf,GameofCheese,14,Tue Jul 21 00:12:49 2015 UTC,"Hey OP. Please don't be so hard on yourself. If you are emotionally overeating to the point that you feel out of control, you have an eating disorder. Would you be so cruel to an anorexic that was slowly dying by just saying ""eat a fucking sandwich""?   I doubt it, because you would understand that it's a mental health issue, not just a will power one.  The American diet and our culture sets us up to fail miserably and almost all of us have some sort of disordered eating. (Try checking out Katie Couric's documentary ""Fed Up"" on Netflix to see how much the system impacts us).  Try making an appointment at an eating disorder clinic. Your insurance will probably cover a therapist trained in Binge-Eating Disorder, and these clinics have Internal Medicine (with some bariatric care sometimes), nutritionists, psychiatrists, and of course therapies specializing in the eating disorder spectrum. Most clinics nowadays cover anorexia, bulimia, overeating, and all other eating disorders in one place, because the roots of the disease are all the same with different manifesting behaviors.  Do yourself and your family a favor, and get help now. You deserve it!"

TwoXChromosomes,3dzezf,alphabehr,5,Mon Jul 20 21:53:10 2015 UTC,"/r/loseit is a great resource. Check the FAQ, you'll find so much helpful info. You'll want to figure out your TDEE (use iifym.com) and eat 1000 calories fewer each day for 2 lbs of loss per week or 500 fewer each day for 1 lb of loss.   Something I find helpful is making a pledge to myself each day.  That way, you can take it one day at a time. Don't worry if you mess up one day, just keep on trucking. And it doesn't matter what you eat for breakfast, you can always change what you have for lunch to correct your day. Don't let one cheat meal ruin your motivation for the entire day.   /r/xxfitness is very useful and accessible as well.   MyFitnessPal is also useful for calorie counting.  I wouldn't recommend eating back exercise calories because you may underestimate how much you burn and end up with a smaller calorie deficit.   Good luck!  You can do this!"

TwoXChromosomes,3dzezf,the_chewtoy,9,Mon Jul 20 23:42:57 2015 UTC,"Tip:  go food shopping directly after a meal with a list and buy ONLY what is on the list. Its much easier to resist all the tempting foods when you aren't hungry.  Weight watchers helps a person identify what they call ""Frankenstein foods"", those unhealthy snack things.  Mine are chocolate and crisps. So I made a rule I can only have a small packet of crisps and a small chocolate, IF I have walked to the shop to buy them.  I do this about once a week.  It gives me a bit of something I like but also allows me to still lose weight.  Get a food journal and write down what you eat and how you are feeling and what else you are doing when you are eating.  This will help you identify what possible triggers for binge eating are.  If you know what these are you can find better ways than food to deal with the triggers.  Another good tip is to not eat in front of the tv or while reading a book or on the computer etc.  When you eat a meal or a snack, make a thing about it.  Sit at a table, which you have set properly and concentrate on what you are eating.  Eat slower so your body has time to let you know when you are full.  Use smaller plates, so you have smaller servings of food.  This tricks your brain into thinking you have eaten more than if you have a small portion on a big plate.  Don't eat all the food on your plate.  In the beginning whatever is left over on your plate, throw it away.  Later on as you develop more self-control you can put the leftovers away for another meal.    When you find yourself in the kitchen looking for something to eat,  try distract yourself, take a short walk, even if its just around your living room.  Start a hobby that requires clean hands like knitting.  If after distracting yourself, you do feel hungry, make a ceremony of having a snack.  I know these are a lot of things, but most important of all is this last tip.  Change like this takes time.  People who successfully lose a lot of weight and keep it off for any real length of time do it SLOWLY.   So start with making healthy habits one step at a time.  It may be worth saying, for this month I will do this healthy thing.  At the end of the month, you add another one and so on and slowly over time you will have a healthy lifestyle.  Losing weight is not a sprint, its a marathon."
TwoXChromosomes,3dzezf,billandteds69,4,Mon Jul 20 20:28:19 2015 UTC,"Congratulations!  (Or condolences.) It sounds like you've bottomed out.  I'm a guy, but I was in your shoes for a while.  I ballooned up to 360 lbs, but I finally figured out some of the medical problems that were keeping me from exercising.  Once I could exercise physically, I broke the emotional barriers that kept me from losing weight.  Those were my triggers.  Bottoming out is really the first step to making a change.  You feel like hell now, so use that to push you into making a change.  Everyone has a diet to recommend, or a product, or something.  I'll tell you what it was for me.  Robard Corporation has a couple of different diet types.  I forget the two names, but basically they produce specifically metered food that's designed to provide proper nutrition on LCD and VLCD (low cal diets and very low cal diets).  I did one that kept me on about 800 calories a day for about a year, and dropped 150 lbs through diet and exercise.  However, they are only sold through doctors, so you'll need to visit their site and see if a local doctor sells their products.  As you probably know, losing weight is ALL about diet.  Exercise is good in that it helps slow the muscle loss that invariably occurs with weight loss, but to lose weight, it's all diet.  Happy to discuss if you like, ma'am--just shoot me a note and I can respond.    Once you start seeing the results, it's just so much easier to stay on the diet.  If you can be strong for a month, you'll be amazed at yourself. and the difference it makes.  Imagine fitting into all those clothes that you grew out of, seeing that scale go down every few days when you weigh.  Good luck!"
TwoXChromosomes,3dzezf,tiffibean13,4,Mon Jul 20 21:05:01 2015 UTC,I think you would benefit from some mom workout and nutrition groups. You can find these groups on Facebook and meetup.com and they are so helpful and supportive on a daily basis! You are not alone in this struggle. I know you mentioned financial difficulties but you don't need a gym membership to workout. Make a 2 mile + plus part of your routine every day. You can even find some other moms to walk with. There are tons of mom and kid workout videos online (warning: they kick your butt!) that are completely free. And you should do a short yoga video before bed at night since you're struggling with depression. Just a short one for like ten minutes. These things will help and your nutrition will follow.

One meal to eat pizza, a burger, whatever your favorite splurge food is. Go on short walks. Start at 10 minutes abd work your way up. You don't have to work run marathons every day; again start small!    And rememebr, every time you choose carrots over cookies, YOU WIN! Every time you drink water instead of soda, YOU WIN!

I have also battled with depression and it only got worse after I had my son. The first thing that I had to address was the depression, in my area there was a postpartum psychologist available that went on walks with me twice a week. You might be able to reach out to a mommy group that helps women struggling with depression. It is often a free tool and a great resource for when times are really bad and help seems unavailable.  As for weight loss, counting calories is a great start. It's a cheap and easy way to see where you are at and where you would like to be at.  Your sons plates are also a good tool for portion control. I also continued taking walks with my son, he was and is my main motivator to living a healthier life. Set goals. It could be a week without ice cream or an hour in the park actively playing with your son twice a week or anything. Celebrate when you reach your goals with a planned out reward. For me I bought the correct size pants at the thrift store, just a pair for under 10 bucks, then I tossed all my comfy loose ones. For me the reward was seeing I was going from plus size, to large, to a medium. You deserve to see how your hard work has paid off.

TwoXChromosomes,3dzezf,waytogoraus,3,Tue Jul 21 03:07:15 2015 UTC,"When I was 21 I weighed 300lbs. Female. Then I started eating better and exercising (2 things  I'd tried previously, but perhaps not in combination before). I lost about 135lbs in less than a year. Have kept most of it off over the last 14 years, with a variation of 15-20lbs.  I feel should be able to give you should be able to give you some tips! But I struggle to remember what precisely it was; I decided to get fit and eat healthy. I was a vegetarian who didn't eat vegetables. I lived on huge plates of pasta.  I followed the healthy food pyramid. I ate 5 serves of fruit and veggies. Protein. Yoghurt. Brown bread. I walked most days (at first I was so sweaty and gross, but it was motivating when I found it was getting easier). It was hideous to start with, I hated people seeing me walk in the street. But I just put my headphones on and went anyway. Then I joined a gym when I'd lost  about 30lbs, and the weight really started to shift, with some resistance training. Walking into the gym was about the single most terrifying thing that I've done, ever. Turns out though, people go to the gym for the same reason, and will not mock you for getting fit.   I was young, no responsibilities, it was all about me. I had all the time in the world to exercise. It didn't matter if I slapped 3 veggies and 2 eggs on toast on the plate for tea. You may have to find a different approach to work in with your life.  I feel like my thinking changed entirely, something switched in my brain. My new eating meant I  that I ate my daily serves of vegetables, fruit,  protein, grains. I also had a weekly treat meal where I'd eat whatever I wanted. Just for that meal though.  At your current weight, I think you will have great success with a similar eating program. Nothing fancy. No Atkins, none of this 'don't eat carbs after 4 jumpsuit. Small, consistent changes will make such a big difference for you.   While I was losing the weight, I've never felt such elation in all my life (aside from post-birth hormones).  I was ridiculously happy like all the time. Was like My body was on a high all the time from having real food and endorphins from the exercise. Things it never had before.  I'm 36 now, not long had my first baby last year, gained friggen 60lbs. I managed to lose it, but it was much harder. I did WW. It was a slow .5kg per week. But, tortoises and hares right?   Be the tortoise. Head down tail up, you can do it."
TwoXChromosomes,3dzezf,milkbug,2,Tue Jul 21 09:23:10 2015 UTC,"Step #1 to losing weight for me was gaining some confidence in myself. I saw nutritionists, signed up for programs (including Weight Watchers), and bought fancy equipment/clothes, but I could not stick with any of it until I convinced myself that I was worthy of feeling good. I battle depression and anxiety, and it took me years of therapy to realize that I deserve to feel good about myself. I deserve health and happiness, and I am smart, disciplined, and strong enough to achieve health and happiness for myself.   You mention that you feel like you should just, ""Close [your] fat mouth and exercise."" It's obviously true that eating less and exercising will help you lose weight, but I think that your attitude toward these two things will define your success or failure. Right now it seems like you are seeing diet and exercise as easy things that you are not good enough achieve, when in reality they are both mentally and physically challenging, and will require you to make big adjustments to your life. It will be hard, so you need to do your best to believe that you can do it. You are good enough, and you deserve it.   I guess the moral of this very corny comment is that you need to work on your mental health before you can fully tackle your physical health. When I started, I was a 17 year old girl and 250lbs. I'm now 22 and 150lbs. I still have days when I hate myself and think that I am a fat ass and binge eat until I cry. Some days I am proud of myself and think that I am sexy and strong. These days outshine the bad ones. The mental battle is a difficult one and it will probably never go away, but it is worth fighting."

I personally love myfitnesspal. I don't use it to keep track of exercise but I do use it to count calories. I like it because you can adjust your calorie intake based on what results you want and you can keep track of your progress on it as well. I've noticed that when I keep track of my calories consistently I lose weight even if I have some bad days. Also I try to squeeze in exercises here and there throughout the day. I bike to and from work for example or I will walk to the grocery store and what not. Also I do a bit of exercise at home. I like doing planks because they help my back and core. It has taken me a long time to figure out what works for me and you just have to experiment and find what works for you. Its a very difficult process but I know you can do it!

I wasn't hungry, but for some reason I was eating anyway.  And when I realized that I decided I was done.  I stopped and went into the living room.  But five minute later I was in the kitchen again looking for food, and hadn't even realized I'd gotten up.  So this time I grabbed a carrot, and peeled it, and ate the carrot.  And what I noticed was that I wasn't hungry, I just wanted to crunch something with my teeth.  And I realized that it had been nearly two weeks since I'd eaten something that wasn't soft.  Nearly everything I ate was mushy in one way or another, and so I wanted to crunch something, and I'd go in the kitchen and pick something, and eat it, but I still wanted to crunch something, so I'd go again and get something else.  I finished the carrot and didn't want anything else.  I don't know if that's something you experience, but it might be worth thinking about."
TwoXChromosomes,3dzezf,staple-salad,2,Tue Jul 21 00:40:59 2015 UTC,"Exercise can release endorphins, which may help with the depression. The key is getting a routine that you can stick to. If you try to take on too much, too fast, you're going to get discouraged and burnt out. If you have a physical activity you enjoy doing (hiking, swimming, tennis, whatever), then do that. Commit to exercising every day, or every other day. It doesn't have to be any great amount; you can just go jogging until you get winded. If that's a tenth of a mile, great; you've gotten your blood flowing, and can feel good about yourself because you got out and did something. If you focus on the positive, rather than the negative, you'll feel better about yourself and more motivated to continue with your diet and exercise. Best of luck on your journey."

TwoXChromosomes,3dzezf,asianmasaccount,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:10:08 2015 UTC,"I'm still under 50, but barely. My doctor wants me to go to a nutritionist first, so I'm going to try that. I know that I can do it without surgery, so I'm going to try again."
TwoXChromosomes,3dzezf,AnnaTrocity,2,Tue Jul 21 02:47:09 2015 UTC,"If you ever do go for the surgery, go for a gastric sleeve rather than a bypass. It's a much less drastic surgery, heals quickly, fewer side-effects. It won't give you as much a weight loss boost as a bypass would, but it may be enough for you.  My BMI was 65 when I had my gastric sleeve done 16 months ago and it's 34 now."
TwoXChromosomes,3dzezf,kikeleh1488,2,Tue Jul 21 06:44:13 2015 UTC,"All insurance plans require you to try first without surgery.   Obviously it's a huge decision and a personal one for you. If I can give my two cents though, I don't think it's right to frame is as a ""nutritionist=proper way"" versus ""surgery=easy way out"". Not even saying you are doing this, but it's something I saw a lot. The bypass and sleeve procedures significantly improve diabetes (dunno if this applies to you) and a few other things completely independently of weight loss. Some doctors are even marketing it as a ""diabetes curing surgery"" instead of a ""weight loss surgery"" nowadays, or at least talking about doing that. 50 BMI is just a number I grew out. I'm pretty sure anything over the forties qualifies you.   Plus it's a false equivalence that surgery=easy way out. I've seen plenty of people ""beat"" their bypass haha. Sleeve is actually even a little easier to beat. I'm a med student btw. I was in post-bypass clinic a couple of times and some of those people look and feel goooood, just sayin'.   No matter what your decision is though, right now you're doing the right thing by losing some weight first. They want you to already start shedding by surgery time so you ""glide"" into more losses. Works the best that way. I forgot the exact figure but something like at least 10-20 pounds prior to surgery is strongly encouraged.   Obviously there are huge risks to any major surgery as well. Absorption deficiencies, having to eat small meals forever, complications of the procedure itself. Try to keep an open mind though.   Haha so full disclosure I have no financial stake in this. I'm going into internal medicine. The surgeons I rotated with did do some salesmanship though. Nothing even a little bit sketchy, but I remember this one guy carried a BMI wheel in his pocket and asked every patient ""what would you like your ideal weight to be?"" Then he would put his wheel on the stated goal and look them right in the eye and be like ""I think we can do that together"". Haha it was some Joel olsteen shit."

TwoXChromosomes,3dzezf,Destroyers25,2,Tue Jul 21 07:35:08 2015 UTC,"Someone else mentioned the documentary Fed Up, and I just watched that this weekend. It talks about how obesity is a national problem, not just an individual problem, but society tends to put the blame on you as an individual. All of the messages out there are ""stop eating and exercise."" It's not that simple, and a lot of us know it, so don't feel disgusting or guilty. That's an awful cycle to get stuck in. I think the other comments suggesting therapy are wise, because if you are struggling with depression, that makes everything harder. I struggled with depression for years, and finally got treatment for it this spring, and it has made a world of difference in my life. The biggest tip I got from the documentary Fed Up is that all calories are not equal. Processed sugars run right through your body, spike your blood sugar like crazy, and actually cause you to overeat.  Low fat products have extra sugar in them to keep them from tasting like shit. So the best way to avoid the sugar poured into almost everything in the American diet is to try to stick to the perimeter of the grocery store when shopping - fruits & veggies, eggs, etc - try to avoid eating things with ingredients you can't pronounce that have been highly processed. That's the biggest overhaul I have taken in my life, and I've already lost 10 pounds in the last two months without increasing exercising (planning on losing more). I know that cooking like that can be really difficult too because there is so much out there on the internet that is confusing and overwhelming, but you can make some awesome stuff if you have a crockpot. If you want any recipes, let me know!"
TwoXChromosomes,3dzezf,perogi21,2,Tue Jul 21 10:16:55 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem I have with weight and eating is that for me, food is the enemy. Growing up, meals were...variable.  I competed with my family for what there was and if there was the opportunity to pig out, well, stand back, kids.  As an adult, any suggestion that I should be careful about how much I eat at the dinner table provokes the opposite reaction in me.  If my wife says, actually, we won't have this extra side dish at a restaurant, I get a flash of anger.    I still haven't solved it, really.    The things that did help me, though, were being open and honest with people around me about how I feel about food, what triggers bad reactions in me and asking them not to get involved.  My wife really struggles to bite her tongue when I ladle those extra spoons of mashed potato on my plate, but the damage to my perception of food security does more harm in the long run.  Having a plan several days in advance for what I'll be eating makes a massive difference to me as well.  If I don't have a plan for a meal I can (and do) simply hit the supermarket and buy a sandwich, a ready meal, a pasta salad and a bag of sweets and regret it even before I've finished eating.    In terms of diet, I personally found the fasting diet really effective.  I've tried 5:2 and 4:3 (Mon/Wed/Fri) but at the moment I just do one on, one off.  It is definitely not perfect - and it doesn't solve anything about how you deal with food - but if your weight is a health issue, like mine is, and you simply need to get it off, I have found it super effective, not least because I can pig out without shame on my off days.  Just being 10-20kg lighter than you were makes a massive difference to how you feel.  As for long term motivation, I think trying to think like that is setting yourself up for failure.  A day where you do the right things is a good day; a day where you don't is a bad day.  The more good days you have, the better.  When you have a bad day, it doesn't define you or your lifestyle; it's just one more day, even if there have been ten or twenty or thirty bad days in a row.  You can have a good day tomorrow."
TwoXChromosomes,3dzezf,aithne1,2,Tue Jul 21 11:32:51 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing to remember is to love yourself. It's a hard thing to do and we all struggle with it. Your life, like every life is an unbelievably valuable thing. It is worthy of love and is to be respected.   If you want to get to a more healthy weight, it's a simple, but difficult process. I don't know your schedule, but let's assume you rise in the morning and sleep at night. Let's also assume you have a regular time you wake up. 7 let's say. The first step is getting up earlier, and drinking water and taking a walk. Get up around 5:30, drink a LARGE amount of water. (I drink two and a half pints. I'm a 6'1"", 205lbs male that lost 25lbs by increasing my water intake since last football season.) It's going to be hard, I've been drinking that much water twice per day for months and I still hate it, but it works. After your water, don't eat yet, go for a walk. Preferably an hour or more, but you might have to work up to that. I personally struggle with long distance running, I know it sucks to work up to a goal, but you need to do it like I did. Doing this everyday, along with replacing all other beverages, including coffee, with water, will yield massive results. Eat the types of food you like, but drink a large bottle of water before, and then another during the meal. As well take a daily multivitamin. This will keep food intake lower, fluid intake high, and you can still enjoy the foods you like. At night, drink another LARGE amount of water. I drink just as much right before bed as I do when I wake up. At first you'll wake up to use the bathroom a lot, but like me, you'll be able to sleep through the night no problem after a week or so. I don't know about you, but I hate drinking water. I NEVER drank water besides during sports up until I purposely added it to my diet. I drank mostly Gatorade of Iced Tea, soda and other sugary drinks. I still drink them with meals on occasion, but water now dominates my drink choices all day long, including most meals. It's a hard transition, but it can be done.   The water alone will give you more energy, healthier skin and hair, better physical functions and in general, a more healthy body. The water with meals will keep portions smaller, lead to weight dropping, will at the same time preventing dehydration and cut down on sluggishness and head aches. I like a lot of salt and sugar in my diet. This makes me sluggish though and gives me head aches and makes me tired. I'm not willing to cut them out of my diet and I don't, but a lot of water combats these problems. When you have a head ache or are tired around mid-day, the best thing is a LARGE amount of water and a nap, not a cup of coffee. The walk in the morning before the meal will burn a lot of calories, it's better than a run by far. It's a time for you to relax and be by yourself before the chaos of the day.   Remember that progress is slow and it will be at times difficult. I was a pretty success full high school athlete with the ability to play in college, but I choose the military instead. By the end of my senior year of football, I was 6'1"" and 230lbs. I was a 335lbs bencher, 450lbs dead lifter, 225lbs presser and I could go on, but I won't, no point.... Except that I was also not at a healthy body fat and needed to change that. I added a lot of water to my diet and I dropped to 205lbs. I'm not saying this is the only way to lose weight, but it is a way that I know can work and worked well for me. I know my progress is not monumental and seems small compared to your goal, but you will see that the weight will start to drop quickly and consistently as you stick with your plan.  Best of luck on the way to your goal."

OP, work with your nutritionist to make a meal plan. At the store, buy only what you need for those meals. Make a rule - you cannot phone out for food, and anything outside of your meal plan must be balanced with enough exercise to burn it off. When you're tempted to break these rules, ask yourself if that moment of tasting is worth death and immobility, because that is what it is. It's not a treat, it's not a reward, it is a millstone around your neck.   Distract yourself. Tempted to drive somewhere to get a fix? Play with your son. Buy some light dumbbells and start googling how to use them. Work on a project... Sew something, build something. Find joy in other things, and treat food as just your fuel to do them, a fuel whose quality  you can optimize. Food is not love. Your child is love, your passions are love. Prioritize them and put food back in its place.  Best of luck, OP."

TwoXChromosomes,3dzezf,iliikepie,3,Mon Jul 20 21:52:19 2015 UTC,"I just lost 45 lbs in the last 4 months.  Here is how I did it.    Step 1) Get the tools you need.    a) A Fitbit --This was a critical part to me losing weight.  b) a Scale to weigh your self daily --Its really important to weigh in daily.  You need to know when your slipping so you can re-double your efforts.  c) a BMI calculator  Step 2) Set up your fitbit and put a target weight in there on the fitbit web site.  I believe that you can also set a date which you would like to achieve your target weight.  Set your food program and put it on a 1000 calorie per day deficit.  Doing any less will just take way too long and you will probably get discouraged.  Plus, its easy to underestimate calories and 500 calorie deficit will not give you a big enough margin of error.  Step 3) Weigh yourself daily.  Record everything you eat religiously in the fitbit program.  I found that after recording calories I was eating way more then I thought.  It was a rude awakening and I had to re-adjust what I was eating.  You will quickly come to the conclusion that any liquid which is not water or tea is crazy bad for you.  Just drinking soda or juice will rock you over your calorie target in an instant.  After about 2 or 3 months of doing this, I was able to re-adjust my eating habits to where I no longer need to micro-manage what I'm eating.  Also after the first 30 days I was pretty much over the ""being hungry all the time"" factor.  My body just naturally adjusted.      4) Get your self a gym membership and schedule 2 or 3 days a week to get in there.  my Gym offered 2 free personal training sessions and the trainer put together a workout routeen.  Always follow up a workout routeen with some time on the treadmill.  Weight loss is litterally a function of calories in vs calories out.      Weight loss is 85% diet and 15% workout.  If you do both you will get the fastest results.  But you can do it just though fixing your eating alone.  Only working out but not watching what you eat will not get you there."

Most people don't do that until it's far too late, so you're already ahead of the curve. One tip I would give you is to keep a food diary pinned to the start page on your phone. Every time you're about to eat a meal, record all the food before you start. Don't leave things out, or you're only hurting yourself. No one else. At the end of the day count your calories and you'll immediately have a good starting point for cutting to under 1600 calories.  Another thing is to start working out. I know, it sucks. I hate it too. There are a couple of ways to make it suck less (it will still suck a little): involve your son, take him on walks or out to play games. Tag, football, baseball, whatever. He will like it, this will introduce him to the world of sports and health, and he will (in his own way) hold you accountable.  Second, as hard as it will be as first, train hard and not long. Sprint for a minute and then walk for two minutes, don't jog for three minutes. You're more likely to go back tomorrow and it'll make a bigger difference faster.  Third, and I see this in some other comments as well, keto is fantastic and really good for losing fairly large amounts of weight fairly quickly.   You'll make it, don't worry. PM me if you need it.

You already know what it takes to eat healthy, but you can't do it due to emotional barriers.   Go to therapy, work hard, and dig up all of those issues.

Of course everyone is different, but from someone who used to weight every day and would get extremely depressed when the scale when up even when I was doing ""everything right"" it's just not for everyone.   If you're a data freak and if it wouldn't ruin your day to know you've gained a bit or that you're not moving in the scale, sure, it's just not for everyone."
TwoXChromosomes,3dzezf,goats_are_orange,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:53:23 2015 UTC,"Weigh yourself in the morning. Every Day. EVERY DAY   Bad idea. Weight fluctuates a lot day to day.  I'm currently losing weight (had weight loss surgery a while back) and in my case my weight fluctuates A LOT based on my period. I lose about 7-8 lbs in the week preceding my period, and gain back 3-4 right after my period starts. During the rest of the cycle, my weight dwindles down extremely slowly, maybe by 1-2 lbs per month. It's like the effort I put in during the month shows up all at once."
TwoXChromosomes,3dzezf,jefecaminador1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:44:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly at this point, you need to look at liposuction, stomach stappling, etc. as options. There was a study that showed you have 1 in 677 or 0.15% chance of returning to a normal weight. Lipo or stomach stapples along with correcting your diet and workout really is your best decision and if you're serious about losing weight, you can keep the weight off.  Also, running or any other type of exercise can really screw with your knee and back if you're really heavy.  Link to the article: http://www.healthline.com/health-news/obese-people-have-slim-chance-of-obtaining-normal-body-weight-071615#2  There is a published study about it somewhere too."
TwoXChromosomes,3dzezf,funchy,-4,Tue Jul 21 00:28:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't know if this is possible for you, however my wife struggled with her weight for nearly the entire time we have been together (over 14 years).  At her heaviest she was 345.  We finally decided to go with the gastric sleeve surgery after years and years of trying to change her lifestyle through diet, exercise, weight watchers, meal replacements, etc.  I am not saying that we were super diligent and diet/exercise failed, it just more than we were able to keep up with and constantly failed at keeping up.  Now my wife is feeling great and losing weight faster than I ever imagined.  She finally feels that full feeling after eating where as before she never got that mental ""STOP"" message.    We didn't have the money to get the surgery done here in the states.  What we ended up doing is flying her to Tijuana to get the surgery done in Mexico.  After we consulted with our doctor he did say that medical tourism is becoming more and more popular due to the costs of medical procedures in the states.  It cost about 4,500$ for the surgery in Tijuana and if you got a loan for that amount you may be able to afford the payments.  It is certainly a lot cheaper than most places here in the states.  That price includes the ticket, surgery, medicine, hospital care.  I firmly believe this is the only option for a lot of people and we had a great experience thus far.  We used www.weightlossagents.com and honestly we wouldn't have if we didn't have a family friend recommend them.  You do have to get over the fact that you are in Mexico and Tijuana isn't exactly a great vacation destination but once you get the surgery done, your life will change for the better.    I hope this helps and I would be happy to give more info.  Ill even see if my wife can set up a conversation with you if you are worried.   My heart pours out to you and I hope you realize that you are not your weight.  You are a great person and this is something a lot of people struggle with.  Good luck!"

Hah tell you to close your fat mouth? no no no you need to learn to eat properly and not give in to commercial food interests.   Alright first off I'm going to tell you your attitude sucks.  Second I am going to give you a rather strange diet.  Third I am going to give you some life advice   and last but not least! I'll start you exercising.  Okay step one. Your attitude it sucks ass. Don't know what to do? yeah you do. You're making excuses. Motivation is bullshit what you need is discipline. Discipline  leads to self control and forces you to do things not like that fleeting pansy motivation. Whelp now that that's over with step two!  I know of a diet plan which you must follow which will allow you to get your weight under control. It was created for heart patients to loose weight before surgery. So here is your new diet! it isn't full time it tweaks your metabolism. This is a pre heart surgery diet that got appropriated as a fad.  Day 1: BREAKFAST  Black Coffee or Tea 1/2 Grapefruit or Juice 1 Slice of Dry Toast 1 Tbsp. of Peanut Butter  LUNCH  Black Coffee or Tea 1/2 Cup of Tuna 1 Slice of Dry Toast or 1 Oz. of Cheddar Cheese  DINNER 3 Oz. any Lean Meat 1 Cup String Beans 1 Cup Carrots or Beets 1 Small Apple 1 Cup Vanilla Ice Cream  Day 2: BREAKFAST  Black Coffee or Tea 1 Egg 1 Slice of Dry Toast 1/2 Banana  LUNCH Black Coffee or Tea 1 Cup of Cottage Cheese or 1/2 Cup of Tuna  5 Saltine Crackers  DINNER  2 Beef Franks 1 Cup Cabbage or Broccoli 1/2 Cup Carrots or Turnip Greens 1/2 Banana 1/2 Cup Vanilla Ice Cream  Day 3  BREAKFAST  Black Coffee or Tea 5 Saltine Crackers 1 Oz. of Cheddar Cheese 1 Small Apple  LUNCH  Black Coffee or Tea 1 Hard-Boiled Egg 1 Slice of Dry Toast  Dinner  DINNER  1 Cup Tuna 1 Cup Beans or Cauliflower 1 Cup Carrots or Beets 1 Cup Melon 1/2 Cup Vanilla Ice Cream  Do not deviate from this food. Do not substitute. This is for three days.   Well what about the other four?  You eat regular human food in reasonable portion sizes. Now what does that mean? you aren't going to pig out and you're not going to eat processed foods.  You are now one of those people who makes everything fresh. We are putting the work back into your food. What are reasonable portions? consult the USDA or Canadian food guide.  What you will not be eating at any time? packaged pre made meals, canned fruit, pre made meat products, instant anything. No take out simple.  What does this little odd diet do? trains you to eat less while giving you a few days of negative caloric values.  Okay so we've handled your diet!  Okay so now we're on to lifestyle! you say you have a kid and you don't have time? Bullplop. Kids run like rockets and if you're active they'll be active and your life will be a hell of a lot easier. You won't deal with hyper activity.  Now I've already said you're dropping the whole pre made pre packaged crap. That's your first lifestyle change. The second is you are not to touch another carbonated beverage or any sweet beverage in your life. They're crap. Diet ones are worse. You feel like shit because its a depressant for gods sake and that keeps you down. Just stick to our friend mr water. Next salty snacks? fuck em. there is no such thing as light chips and light junk food. Light pringles for example are the old recipe of pringles they actually made the what they call regular worse for you so the old recipe could be ""light"". Light products are  bullshit you now avoid them like the plague.  As I said you now cook everything from scrach. Why? because it reconnects you with the amount of labour it takes to make food so you won't just scarf willy nilly. It also helps not to have any god damn snacks around. Oh and dried fruit is a processed food do you know how much sugar they put in that sheash.  Oh and pre made food and products is designed to make you want more. Food companies spent billions to figure out the sweet spot which puts our animal instinctive drive to find sugar and fats in front of our higher brain functions. You can't control it so you avoid it ;)   Next  you have to put less stock in your appearance determining your worth. Wait what?! simple if you keep putting yourself down you'll never get anything done! you'll keep giving up and well fuck that.  Okay now we've covered a basic diet  and some no no's we've covered your attitude and such. now on to exercise. You do have time take it from your sitting time ;)  Excersize? start walking. Simple start out going for a walk with the family than move up from there as you gain more stamina. After you can walk great distances we'll talk again. Theres no point in giving a beginner anything at first it just scares em off. We'll start building up your stamina. Oh and you're husband/ boyfriend/ wife/ girlfriend  / boy toy / girl toy/ random strangers in a bus depot or what have you will like this you should have more sex. It is exercise and  fun to boot and honestly as your stamina increase it gets much more fun ;) oh and regular humping should help with those silly body image bullshit.  Easy peasy :D   Now only an idiot expects instant results please don't be an idiot.  Now if you don't know how to cook properly that is something I can help you with in spades my friend:D   I can also instruct you in the fine art of seasoning."

I married late (36) and we hoped we would add a child of our own to his two sons from his first marriage. After 4 miscarriages we discovered I would never be able to carry a child to term. Being the logical person that I am we decided to focus on the kids we have. I ended up having a hysterectomy to resolve some of the issues I was having and I felt great. I have two boys who love me and we have a great life. A few years pass and all of the sudden there are 5 pregnancies in our families. I was so sad, but could not understand why...I had made my choice and I was happy with it.  After much thought and conversation I realized I was mourning. Mourning the loss of what society tells me I should be. Mourning being part of the society of ""mom"".  I am not sure it matters if you never wanted kids...we are trained that part of our worth and community is in being a mom...at least that is my perspective."
TwoXChromosomes,3e093e,RoseAuburn,17,Tue Jul 21 00:03:26 2015 UTC,"To be honest with you, even if you were not infertile and simply didn't want children, there is a period in your 20s or 30s (depending on your peer group) where BABIES ARE EVERYWHERE and EVERYONE IS HAVING BABIES and the universe conspires to make you feel inferior. It passes as the kid cohort ages up."
TwoXChromosomes,3e093e,DarlingBri,4,Tue Jul 21 00:51:04 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more with this. I have always wanted children and it's in the plan for the next 5ish years, but honestly being surrounded by baby and kid talk ALL THE TIME is exhausting and has made me feel less strongly about having my own, which I never expected to happen. I am a teacher and all of my coworkers and friends are parents, so the majority of my life is spent taking care of and hearing about other people's children, and yet no one ever wants my opinion about child-rearing because I am not a parent myself. Gah."

TwoXChromosomes,3e093e,GirlWhoLikesGames,10,Tue Jul 21 04:01:10 2015 UTC,"It's normal to feel sad and resentful -- you feel left out. My advice is to double down on being the best aunt possible and stay involved with your family. You have a role here, and it's the role of the Cool Aunt. Growing up, my mom's (still) childfree youngest sister was my idol. She took me shopping, let me sleep over in her awesome apartment and showed me how to put on makeup and was basically the epitome of glamour. Although she never really wanted kids, she had to have a hysterectomy in her early 30's that sealed the deal, and I think she probably felt a lot of the same things you feel as her four sisters all had kids around the same time. But she was and is really happy, and loves her unique status in the family. That could be you!  Also, keep in mind that babies provoke a visceral, emotional reaction that a framed MBA diploma never can...but I'd ask yourself if your parents are really prouder of their teen mom daughter than they are of your accomplishments. More excited and emotional? Of course. But prouder? I doubt it."
TwoXChromosomes,3e093e,smooth_jazzhands,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:47:10 2015 UTC,"Your feelings are normal. To not want something is different from not being able to have something. Depending on your relationship with your parents, I would consider telling them how you are feeling. If you have been vocal at all in the past about not wanting kids, there is a good possibility they have no idea you feel this way right now. I would give them the chance to support you.  And I know my parents are thrilled with grandkids. But that kind of thrill/love is in a different category than other achievements. When I had my first kid, it did not take away the pride they had from when I got my Masters, got married, etc.   I think that just as parents can love more than one kid equally, our own parents forever maintain the capability to feel the same love and pride for each one of their kids. They are just better able to demonstrate it when they are aware of it. Best of luck"
TwoXChromosomes,3e093e,Oohlahh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:22:22 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry this is happening in your life. I can't imagine how you feel with both your own situation and your sister's at the same time.   Do you have a trusted friend or therapist who you can talk to that you won't feel judged when speaking? Sometimes it's hard to feel so upset by something that gives happiness to others but it doesn't make your feelings any less valid. And being able to express them can help.   I wish you peace and am here for a pm if you need it. We have very similar situations.
TwoXChromosomes,3e093e,FluffandNutella,2,Tue Jul 21 04:00:23 2015 UTC,"Your accomplishments are great, and there is nothing wrong with choosing to forego having children. Right now I think your family is just so swept up in the typical baby bliss that they're not remembering how this may be affecting you. Things will calm down with time and eventually go back to normal. Just remember that you bring your family a great deal of joy just by existing and I am sure you continue to be a source of pride for them."
TwoXChromosomes,3e093e,dancingforthemirror,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:02:22 2015 UTC,"This post, that was me 2 years ago.  I too suffer from PCOS and endometrial hyperplasia.  I've been told I was most definitely infertile and with all the pain, I was contemplating getting a hysterectomy, while a lot of friends and younger family members were popping babies like crazy.  I understand too well how it feels, and I think it's pretty normal to be bummed like that.  Not having children is, after all, a big decision that requires a bit of mourning.  Even before I got diagnosed, I did not want kids, I couldn't even begin to think what I'd do with one, but the fact is, I felt cheated out of making my own choices in life in regards to procreating or not.  I think that was the hardest for me to accept, and it did make me a bit bitter during baby showers and family gatherings.  Now, one thing I can tell you is, more or less infertile does not mean infertile (unless of course you get the hysterectomy).  I can tell you that first hand.  I am now a mom (only fools don't change their mind, right?).  Looking back, I can honestly say that prior to my change of heart, I really wasn't at a stage in my life where I wanted kids.  I was focusing on other things (education, career).  I knew that my chances of getting pregnant were pretty slim and I was ok with that, but somehow, everything changed.  People do get a bit crazy with babies around.  That is true.  I got to experience this all too well.  But it doesn't diminish your accomplishments at all.  Don't stress too much about it.  It's the babies that have that effect on people, meanwhile the parents just cease to exist.  The phone calls with 'Hello, how are you?' get upgraded to 'Hello, how is the baby?', it's all about the baby now.  It's excitement, novelty, but nothing you should feel bad about."

Right now - these 'happiest she's ever been' comments are meant to make the mom feel okay about being sleep deprived and being waken up ever 2 hours to be sucked on like the feeding machine she will be for a while.  They aren't about YOU.    Your mom was happy when she had you.  And when she had her siblings.  The over the top comments are meant to ease the way for the new mom.  See a counselor to deal with the grief around your infertility.  It's very much like losing a loved one.  Even though you really didn't want kids, you wanted to know that you had the option.

It's pretty ridiculous you both had a screaming match over this. Throwing water on you is not ok. But it's hard to judge who is really in the wrong without details.

TwoXChromosomes,3e31s6,graygoohasinvadedme,2,Tue Jul 21 16:45:47 2015 UTC,"Less judgmental, for sure. You haven't really explained the behaviors of the girls that are so negative, other than saying they gossip a lot. Is there no way to refocus discussions with them on classes/projects? What about collaborating to attend programs that will help post-gradschool? Do the ones you dislike include everyone in your cohort and you're on the outside, or are there any others you might be overlooking and/or lumping in with the main perpetrators? What about the years above you? Surely not everyone in your program is being mean...because if that is the case you might need to look closely at how you are interacting with them."

My boyfriend is friends with one group, which may be why he dismisses my feelings about it, because he obviously doesn't want to deal with any conflict, so he just makes me feel like I'm imagining it/exaggerating.   He says I should just let it go and try and be friends with them, but how can I trust them? How can I just forget they said malicious things? Once bitten, twice shy and all that.   There's a guy he complains about that does the same thing to him, and somehow him being pissed is justified, but I'm just being stupid and immature?"

Besides being your class peers, these people are also your colleagues. Having a tumultuous relationship with them can possibly impact your future, depending on the type of program you're in.  There's no reason you should trust them right off, but there's also no reason for this to be so black and white. It's perfectly possible to try and get along with them. There's no rule that you have to be friends with your cohort, just friendly. Especially since it seems to be effecting your performance in grad school, which is a huge red flag that something is personally wrong. If you're lonely, find other grad students from other departments or young professionals from outside the school as a whole.   It's also very, very different to feel antagonistic towards one person versus entire groups of people. One person is individually attacking your boyfriend, it feels personal. The female half of your cohort being malicious several months ago is not nearly as personal an attack."

On the other hand, your boyfriend doesn't sound like he's able to keep calm in discussing situations that have nothing to do with your relationship either. Why did this issue, which is not about your relationship, devolve into a screaming match?   I don't really have any details about how the water thing happened. I don't think I would throw water on someone but I don't think I'm fully clear on the context of what happened. It seems mean and an attempt to humiliate, but I can also imagine myself, if faced with a screaming, hysterical person who had me backed up against a wall, if I felt like I couldn't get away and I happened to have a cup of water in my hand...I don't know."

Something I use that helps me a lot is a tool called ""The Model"" (created Brooke Castillo - she's a life coach trainer) - to sum it up as concisely as I can - it's the idea that our ""circumstances"" trigger ""thoughts"" in our heads, those thoughts trigger ""feelings"" and those feelings trigger ""actions"" in us that lead us to the ""results"" we're getting. Circumstances are things we can't change/we have no control over. And we can't change our results, actions or feelings very easily without changing our thoughts first.  For example - the circumstance here is ""girls gossiping about you"". Thoughts - I don't know exactly what you are thinking but it might be that they don't like you or that there is something wrong with you?. That thought will bring on feelings of - say not being good enough, sadness, frustration etc. which makes you take actions - like maybe acting standoffish with them, acting cold or defensive, or more awkward, and that brings you results (you not having friends in your graduate program).   It becomes a self fulfilling prophecy - we see our results as evidence that our thoughts are correct. But we can change our thoughts, which will change how we interact with the world. Instead of thinking that you're not good enough or that there is something wrong with you because of how they act - you could try thinking that they may act the way they do because they are insecure or intimidated by you, or they are awkward themselves, or maybe they don't have any positive female relationship role models in their lives.  Thinking these types of things instead can help you feel more empowered or sympathetic, which will naturally change how you act towards them, which may change your end result.  There's no blame here - you're not causing them to gossip, that's about them and their issues - but you can change how you think about the situation which will help change your whole experience.   Apologies for that being super long. If you are interested in the Model ideal you can google it (lots of videos and writings on it by Brooke) and she recently did a google hangout on putting it in practice. I love it - it helps me feel more in control of my life and see things with a new perspective so I can get out of my own way."

While I feel for her personal experiences, she is flat wrong about there not being a pipline problem.  Thirty percent of Google's 46,170 employees worldwide are women. The percentage is lower for the company's tech sector, where just 17 percent are women. And 21 percent of leadership positions in the company are held by women.May 29, 2014.  Almost exactly 17% of Computer Science graduates are women.  http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/14/percentage-of-bachelors-degrees-conferred-to-women-by-major-1970-2012/  I do not know where to begin on fixing this issue, but I do not think it is here."

From what I've heard from my comp sci friends, as a general rule, if a woman and a man are equally qualified for a position at a respected tech company, the woman is preferred for ~equality~. So if Google isn't hiring women, it's because they're straight up less qualified, and whether that's an issue of gender equality, or lack of interest, or uncomfortable work environment because of the gender equality, it's not Google's fault."

If women are avoiding that field because they assume they'll be discriminated against, do you not see that as a problem? There is plenty of data to support the thesis that even women who graduate successfully can get into engineering, but don't advance in it.   This paper is from Canada, and shows that female Bachelor's degree Engineering graduates started at moderately high incomes, but over 10 years saw almost no advancement in their incomes at at all (only $2,500 increase in salary on average) compared to nearly 10x that amount for every other field among women ($25,600) - meanwhile, male engineering grads saw the highest level of salary advancement of any category ($38,900 increase in salary) (See: ""Table 4"").   That's only the women who successfully graduated in engineering anyways; so these are already highly committed graduates, and they are clearly not advancing in their field to nearly the same level as graduates in other fields, or their male engineering counterparts. I would say that does support the thesis that there is discrimination in the actual job market of engineering, not just education."

TwoXChromosomes,3dysq1,Coomb,5,Tue Jul 21 02:23:54 2015 UTC,"Something is a bit sketchy with those numbers.  To only increase wages by $2500 over 19 years, an increase of 0.2% per year, seems virtually unbelievable.  Your source claims that female bachelor engineers are only earning $56,400 in 2010, yet this source says that female engineers aged 25-34 with bachelor's degrees are earning a median of $61,100.  How can the youngest engineers be earning more than the group?  Further, this source lists the 2011 earnings of various occupations by field and gender.  Some representative numbers:    Field Median Male Earnings Median Female Earnings    Engineering managers 116,725 88,047   Civil, mechanical, electrical and chemical engineers 80,480 66,612   Other engineers 84,058 66,725    Men undeniably make more than women, and these numbers are reasonably consistent with the reported median salary for male bachelor engineers of $105,000.  But these numbers are not really consistent with women earning $56,000 at the median.  It seems much more like $70-75k if the median is assumed to lie somewhere in between the engineer and manager number like it does for the men, discounted slightly to account for the fact that fewer women end up in senior positions (which is a bad thing!).  If the median were $75k, then women engineer's wage growth since 1991 would have been more like $16-21k, which is still disconcertingly low compared to the men's number, but not as massive an anomaly.    Having given this some thought, my suspicion is actually that since your source talks about salary by field of study, not field of employment, a more accurate conclusion is possibly that many women who study engineering often don't end up in engineering employment, much more so than in any other field, which would account for the different statistics.  It may well be that women don't advance once they have employment (though they seem to advance at rates comparable to other industries), but it may well be that women's biggest hurdle is indeed being hired in the first place."

It seems much more like $70-75k if the median is assumed to lie somewhere in between the engineer and manager number like it does for the men, discounted slightly to account for the fact that fewer women end up in senior positions (which is a bad thing!).

That's almost certainly false; on graduation female engineers are earning one of the highest salaries of all fields of study. It's 10 years later that their salaries haven't moved an inch, while every other category of graduates has seen significant advancement."
TwoXChromosomes,3dysq1,fencerman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:00:52 2015 UTC,"Those are the most accurate numbers available on the issue.   Mine are from the same source (Statscan 2011) so your insinuation that my data is flawed is uncompelling. I don't think your numbers are wrong; I questioned if they represented what you say they represented. As I pointed out, your data measures outcomes by field of study, my second source in particular by field of work.  If both sets of numbers are real, then the resolution is that the set of women who study engineering is markedly different from the set of women who work in engineering.  For men, the two sets seem to be roughly identical, since your number is consistent with mine.  My basic point is very simple -- the data I presented shows that women who work in engineering report a median income of $70-75k in 2010.  Yes, that represents a major gap between men and women as I mentioned and you quoted:   to account for the fact that fewer women end up in senior positions (which is a bad thing!)   But if women engineers are making $70-75k median in 2010, then they can't be making $56k median like your source says.  Yes, my numbers show that women are making about 30% less than men, similar to other industries.  As I said, a 0.2% growth in wages (1/10 of inflation!) per year is so small as to be unbelievable, so I went and checked.  My data shows that women engineers' wage increase since 1991 is about $17k - 22k if the original $53k number was accurate, not $2.5k, and similar to the other industries reported by field of study.  As I said - how do you resolve this discrepancy? My proposed hypothesis was that women who studied engineering didn't get hired as engineers at the same ratio (which is a problem!), which leads to a significant depression in their wages since other fields generally pay less.  My other general point was that working engineers who are women have clearly advanced in salary over time, far and away over the stagnant $56k number you reported, and I offered a hypothesis about how to justify these observations.  Edit:   More data: APEGA 2014 Salary Report  There are two really important tables in there - Figure 4 in the main body, shows the distribution of average engineering responsibility level (A-F) by gender.  A's are typically co-ops and EIT's, C's typically have their P. Eng., F's are uppermost technical or managerial levels.  The median female engineer looks to be about a high B or C, the median male engineer is about a high C or D.  There's the promotion gap. Now let's look at Figure 12 in Appendix E, which shows the median salary by experience level by gender. The levels are remarkably equal as a function of responsibility.  But, because of the experience gap, let's sort out the median salaries for men and women:   Men -- median responsibility level C-D -- median salary range: $105k - $130k Women -- median responsibility level B-C -- median salary range: $80k - $105k    Women engineers sure seem to be making a hell of a lot more than $56k...  I get that its Alberta so numbers are elevated, but if you take the lower bound, you are very close to the numbers I reported for the country as a whole, and well above the $56k number from your study."
TwoXChromosomes,3dysq1,scienceisfun,0,Tue Jul 21 16:48:38 2015 UTC,I didn't see anything about overtime in your link.  Any differences in average advancement could easily be explained by working overtime (often unpaid) and other acts of 'dedication' to the job.  There was an article a few months ago that looked at how men are grouped into groups who are promoted or who aren't and dedicating yourself to the company was one of those factors.  As for a reason why one gender would be more willing to sacrifice more for advancement... we live in a society that still demands a certain gender to be the provider and whose ability to provide is factored into their attractiveness as a mate.

The problem is not so much that these sectors are sexist towards women and that they dont welcome them (yes i know not all people are good and there will be assholes but show me a place without assholes). The problem is how social norms push both genders into industries. Women are not entering education and nursing because the other choices are sexist and men do not enter dangerous physical jobs because other industries are sexist. They enter them because that is how they were raised and that is what gender roles tell them what they should do. But somehow it is only a problem when there are not ""enough"" women in high paying tech jobs. It is not a problem when low paying physical jobs are dominated by men. We should stop with all the gender norms and not just the ones that benefit a small subset of the population. Gender quotas are bullshit.

Some of you will say ""well you're clearly not doing enough for women to apply"" and to that I say the following.  We offer flexible hours for employees with children  We offer free child care allowances (a number of the fathers on our team take advantage of this)  We offer full 8 months paid maternity leave at full pay (company wide policy)  And the above is just the beginning, we try to offer as many things as possible to benefit parents as a whole, including paid paternity leave etc.  Across all other departments in the company we have about 35-40% women.  But when it comes to my department, it's 100% male.  This is certainly something we'd like to address, and even have some positive discrimination policies in place such as basically guaranteeing women applying for a software engineering position an interview unless their CV is complete trash.  Articles like this just get me so angry because they essentially end up blaming me and my team for ""passive misogyny"".  When in reality there simply aren't that many female software engineers out there, and least that is my experience.  If there were, we would certainly hire them."

TwoXChromosomes,3dysq1,aport,26,Tue Jul 21 01:22:58 2015 UTC,That's so weird. Every single tech company I've worked at has had at least 20% to 50% females devs. One of them was a tiny 8 person team at an unheard of startup. I need to reach out to the lead engineer there to figure out how he did it.   I will admit that I am part of the problem though. I won't even apply at a company unless I can confirm that there are other women in the engineering department- I had too many bad experiences when I was starting out.

In lots of STEM programs at colleges you can go through a 4 year degree and only have a handful of female classmates for your entire time studying.   The fact that this author completely ignores that and tries to portray the issue as a one sided result of sexism shows her bias and lack of reasoning.
TwoXChromosomes,3dysq1,thats_not_sushi,4,Tue Jul 21 03:46:26 2015 UTC,what a ridiculous article. of course the way to get more women in tech is for them to get interested in tech and learn tech related skills. you can't just hire uninterested and unskilled women for tech jobs. this is the weirdest kind of backwards thinking.

The issue is what women find when they research our industry and what their opportunities and experiences look like once they are here. If we want top candidates to join us in technology, then we need to earn them.  Let's stop blaming women for the failure of big tech companies and VCs to appreciate, respect, hire, fund and promote them. And let's stop trying to solve an urgent, time-sensitive HR problem—the need for big companies to create genuinely hospitable environments for a diverse set of employees—with unrelated measures like teaching kindergarteners how to code or feel-good conferences that don't change how women are hired, promoted, funded or respected.

TwoXChromosomes,3dysq1,bubafina,5,Mon Jul 20 21:37:02 2015 UTC,"Yes and I don't agree with her. I'm not sure why a female tech CEO is telling us that women aren't being allowed to succeed or that women don't like the industry after they get hired. Women are out there doing great work as we speak. For every tech job opening there are like 500 men waiting in line and 50 women. Those are not statistics that lead to more women in the industry. I get the feeling that the author feels like women are unhappy in the industry simply because there aren't more women in the industry with them, and she makes a specific point in the intro to say it also has to do with Steve Jobs and other industry ""legends"" being male. Perhaps she feels like she is being left out, you know, hey I'm a female CEO here why isn't anybody treating me like Steve Jobs?"
TwoXChromosomes,3dysq1,ISBN_10_0441783589,8,Mon Jul 20 18:14:31 2015 UTC,"So this is another instance of you either straight-up not reading the article or just not paying attention to what was said:   I've been in tech since 2001. I didn't see the problems clearly because I'd been part of the industry for too long. I also wanted to focus on getting things done rather than on feminist-inspired activism. So I made the bros-only atmosphere work for me. I overcompensated by picking a frat boy to cofound a company with me (he was MIT & YC). I had the greatest time drinking scotch at Google I/O with some of the best CTOs in the media industry. They treated me like a bro. I didn't want to lose those moments. And I thought that there was room for other women to have a similarly good experience.  I experienced sexism all the time, but I overlooked it because I was too busy working. My year living and working with younger Silicon Valley startup guys in the SoMA district of San Francisco was an onslaught of misogyny, penis jokes, porn references and general lack of common courtesy"

Is that sexist? Do we need to get in there and change the industry so that more men feel comfortable in that female environment and we get it to a close 50/50 parity? No of course not. We just need more men training to be nurses and becoming interested in nursing.

Well, it might be; part of the reason that there are less men in nursing is because they are dissuaded away from typically female careers and lack mentors or role models, which are the same reasons that people posit there are less women in typically male careers.   And in the same way that women are beginning to show up more and more in STEM careers, men are starting to show up more and more in stereotypical female-dominated careers as well. In 2012, there was an analysis of census data done by the NY Times that suggested occupations that are more than 70% female accounted for a third of all job growth for men between 2000 and 2010.   Of course, when men go into female-dominated careers, they tend to out-earn women and get fast-tracked into leadership / supervisory / management roles, so it's not quite even yet."

I'm going by what came up when I was researching about limitations placed on men in female-dominated careers (education and nursing, mostly):    Mentioned here and based on the data found here.   Mentioned here and based on this study   Mentioned here and based on the previously mentioned study   Mentioned here - this one is behind a pay wall, but the study's abstract concludes ""Men benefit from their minority status through assumptions of enhanced leadership (the assumed authority effect), by being given differential treatment (the special consideration effect) and being associated with a more careerist attitude to work (the career effect). At the same time, they feel comfortable working with women (the zone of comfort effect).""   Mentioned here - and based on info found from The Institute for Women’s Policy Research."
TwoXChromosomes,3dysq1,in_pursuit_of,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:38:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, aside from the wage gap thing, which I am reserving judgement on because the methodology is so disappointingly poor, I can't actually get at any of that stuff. I tried to get at Ryan Smith's paper about the Glass Elevator and its behind a pay wall too. Unfortunately I have read far too many papers with amazing abstracts that just fell apart as soon as I looked into the actual paper itself I cannot base any kind of conclusions on it. I'm not saying you are wrong, but the whole topic suffers from a glut of incenstuous circular journalism based on articles most often buried behind pay walls. And from a lot of articles (on any number of topics, sadly) it is clear that the ""journalist"" has not read the full article but just the abstract.   For example, I would like to see the data distribution for female vs. male and observe how symmetrical it is. A more symmetrical data set might benefit more from observing the mean rather than median salary. Regardless, in the first article you linked it is fairly clear that a lot of variables might not be accounted for. The only stipulation for income reporting being the nurse worked more than 50 weeks a year (I think that was the number) and more than 35 hours a week. Obviously the more hours one worked the higher one's pay, especially in a job like nursing where overtime can be substantial. Now, I'm not saying that taking that variable into account would change the end result but to have it not accounted for at all seems to indicate that the data set is not that accurate."
TwoXChromosomes,3dysq1,ISBN_10_0441783589,2,Mon Jul 20 18:40:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sorry, I hate providing studies behind a paywall because who the heck knows if they're useful or not. I looked around for a non-paywall but the best I could find was a quick summary of key findings.   And to be fair, I haven't looked into it very deeply; the focus of my research at the time was more on the lack of mentoring and of women in administrative/leadership roles even in female-dominated fields, so the wage gap was just an interesting footnote as I was studying.    Obviously the more hours one worked the higher one's pay, especially in a job like nursing where overtime can be substantial.    Absolutely true; I don't know whether it's necessarily the basis of the gap, however, since a number of the men interviewed / surveyed specifically mentioned the ability to have flexible hours and spend more time with home and family as reasons they were going into nursing. That isn't to say that they don't maintain more of a ""main breadwinner"" position when compared to women in the same field, of course, since I would expect gender stereotypes and expectations to still apply, at least somewhat."

I understand she sits at a different place and probably see different problems, but to say there's not a pipeline problem when it comes to women is just absurd to me. I'm not as familiar with her world, but I don't understand why we can't say there's a problem both places and they're intricately connected?    Putting the blame on the pipeline problem is good for PR and shareholder value because it shifts blame away from a tech company's leadership and HR departments, and onto women.   No, it really, really doesn't shift the problem ""onto women"". I know that some people say that women are inherently just not as interested. But that's on those people who say that. That's not on me for pointing out there's a pipeline problem. In my experience the issue is that, for whatever reason, many women think that it's ""not for them"" or even that they won't be good at it. Yeah, the latter is not very PC, but I've seen enough timid and nervous looks from women as they step into the basic programming class that I feel I can speak with some confidence. And, just to be clear, they walk out the last day with a very different attitude and do great at the exams.   To me, it's about a society and culture that discourages women from going into tech. Or at least to my part of the pipeline.  I have actually worked in ""outreach"" programs for girls in comp sci, so I do feel a finger pointed at me from her. But I do think it actually works.

This video from Norway does a very good job of explaining exactly what you're referring to (it's quite long) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5LRdW8xw70.  But to summarise, the biggest wide ranging study across 53 countries (with big cultural differences like us, uk, saudia-Arabia, china, etc) show a consistent difference in job preference between the sexes. i.e. you would expect cultural differences in preference, but there are none. Normally this is an indication of biological preference (nature vs nurture).  But why the difference in actual jobs? Well interestingly as a country become more equal (like Norway which was the most equal country) people become more free to follow their actual interests. I.e. the reason India, Russia, etc are closer to gender equality in those industries is because everyone is purely concerned with getting a job that pays well, following their interest are secondary.   So for Norway this went some way to explaining how the most equal country in the world had failed consistently for over 20 years to address gender imbalances in teaching, nursing, engineering, etc. As the society becomes more equal people become less concerned with having to put food on the table, and more concerned with studying and following their actual interests.

TwoXChromosomes,3dysq1,scurvy_durvy,2,Mon Jul 20 22:53:23 2015 UTC,"Author completely misses the point. Until you have a close to parity situation in the pipeline, women will never be equally represented in tech companies.  Is that even a point worth arguing? How are 20% of the STEM graduates going to be equally represented in tech companies? I mean really, how?  Like if all 20% of the women graduates get hired where do the other 40% of the male graduates go? Because if they get hired it doesn't help the ratios at all. It would still be 3/1 just based on graduation rates.  Clearly the biggest work is finding out what obstacles are preventing women from going for degrees in STEM. Is it personal choices, cultural pressures, treatment within the programs at schools?  See those are good topics to explore, not lazy points like the author made."

I'm an engineer and I work for a large manufacturing company. Despite my company's huge efforts in the last few years to hire and retain more women, they're not getting the results they're looking for. Why is that? It's not for a lack of female applicants or even qualified female applicants. One hugs thing I see happen all the time is that our female interns, who are supposed to be the company's pipeline to full time hires, are thrown into an environment with a bunch of men who mostly don't know how to act around young, sometimes attractive, women. At best it's awkward and at its worst it's harassment. So no wonder why they're not taking full time jobs.

I can think of a thousand reasons why, but I will leave them to your imagination.  Anybody who has ever spent any time at all in a hospital might have some inkling as to why IT infrastructure combined with medical technology might you know, revolutionize everything about life, death, illness, and the monetization of medicine.

TwoXChromosomes,3dysq1,sadderdrunkermexican,-2,Mon Jul 20 22:23:20 2015 UTC,"I replied to another comment about this, so will just copy it here for you:   This video from Norway does a very good job of explaining exactly what you're referring to (it's quite long) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5LRdW8xw70.  But to summarise, the biggest wide ranging study across 53 countries (with big cultural differences like us, uk, saudia-Arabia, china, etc) show a consistent difference in job preference between the sexes. i.e. you would expect cultural differences in preference, but there are none. Normally this is an indication of biological preference (nature vs nurture).  But why the difference in actual jobs? Well interestingly as a country become more equal (like Norway which was the most equal country) people become more free to follow their actual interests. I.e. the reason India, Russia, etc are closer to gender equality in those industries is because everyone is purely concerned with getting a job that pays well, following their interest are secondary.   So for Norway this went some way to explaining how the most equal country in the world had failed consistently for over 20 years to address gender imbalances in teaching, nursing, engineering, etc. As the society becomes more equal people become less concerned with having to put food on the table, and more concerned with studying and following their actual interests.  The question is why we have those different interests that seem to exist across all countries regardless of culture."

Ok - first thing - she sounds like a total cunt that has successfully driven a whore-shaped wedge in your relationship. So if you had any guilt about hating her - don't.

The problem is your boyfriend.  1) He possibly lied to you about the cuddling shit years ago  2) He agreed to cut off communication with her and didn't, and they talk about inappropriate things  3) He communicates heavily and/or meets up with her at least once per year (I'm guessing he's been cheating on you during these little reunions)  4) He said HER name in bed (This just adds to my assumption that he's been cheating with her when they meet up)  5) He messages HER during sex with you.... do you even have a single reason to think he's not cheating at this point?  My advice - write each of these things in a list - hand the list to him and tell him that these are the reasons you can't trust him.   Personally, I'd break it off now, while the ball is in your court and before you get really hurt.

TwoXChromosomes,3e10uw,dancingforthemirror,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:11:45 2015 UTC,"I was very afraid to go to therapy at first. I went in college when I was 20 or so and I ended up not minding it so much. I always felt like someone would lock me up for thinking too crazy or laugh at my problems, but the lady I was seeing never did. We just talked about whatever I wanted to that day, even if it was just what movies I liked or how school was going. It's very easy going if you go to the right person and you can take your own pace. It shouldn't be stressful of embarrassing at all. Just take your time and let the wall down and you'll start to feel better. They may prescribe something for you to take- don't feel embarrassed about that either. Tons of people you wouldn't even think of take anti depressants. Even the therapist I saw took them at one point in her life. Sometimes you just need a little chemical help to whip you back into happy shape! But really, no one is helpless. It's their job to listen and make you feel better. If you don't have anything to talk about, don't worry too. They're good at prompting as long as you don't hardball it lol.  Basically, just relax and treat it like you're talking to a friend to get things off your chest. And remember- you're not alone. I hope this helped and I hope you get to feeling better!!!"

I did trust my therapist pretty early on though."
TwoXChromosomes,3e10uw,thespian_badger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:53:05 2015 UTC,I have seen a few different therapists and have varying levels of trust and at different stages with all of them.   I started to feel like a hard therapy session was when the most progress was being made for me - because it meant that I wasn't spending time and co-pay on discussing topical stuff. But with my current therapist it was really a long time before I felt like we were making progress.   Don't feel bad about giving it a shot with this therapist and maybe trying another. It's your time and personal investment and you should feel comfortable and trust them.   Good luck!
TwoXChromosomes,3e10uw,FluffandNutella,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:04:44 2015 UTC,"My story is pretty similar to yours. My life is pretty good now, but I have had this childhood trauma constantly lurking under the surface. I've been working with a therapist this year to try to deal with the unresolved stuff.   I definitely feel worse in the short term the day I meet with him, and I feel pretty raw at the moment in general (crying more easily for example). But I am slowly coming to see where some of my insecurities come from, and I feel like I'm rebuilding my self confidence from a secure basis. So I am feeling confident that I'll be stronger in the longer run."

I did some breathing and mindfulness work, and it did have a positive effect on me. You might want to look up MIT's studies on mindfulness."
TwoXChromosomes,3e10uw,619shepard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:56:16 2015 UTC,"I am currently in therapy now after dealing with longstanding issues with depression, anxiety, family and relationship issues. I've gone for about two months now (and have a smattering of experiences with counseling from childhood) and some days it's more difficult than others. It's difficult for me to open up at times, and occasionally I still have trouble opening up to my counselor. She's noticed this and has tried to get me to open up more, encouraging me and being patient with me. I guess the best advice I can give is yes go in with some goals in mind. If that's difficult to do go in with how you want to feel, or what you think you want to get out of therapy. Be open with your counselor about your goals. I don't want to say don't be afraid of opening up because that can be quite difficult. But do expect to talk about uncomfortable subjects and attempting to work through them. When I spoke about family issues with mine, immediately she suggested a more forgive and forget route which I'm not entirely comfortable with yet. I expressed this to her the next session, and we worked through it. I think a lot of people go in to therapy thinking that their counselor is always going to immediately make the best suggestions for them, and that's not always the case. If a counselor makes you feel uncomfortable, address it with them, if they are insistent on the thing that's making you uncomfortable find a new counselor. Overall, it may seem like you're digging up old wounds that you thought have been sealed, but usually it is important to bring these things up and work through them with your therapist."
TwoXChromosomes,3e0d2e,blerrycat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:59:06 2015 UTC,"There are some CDC stats that say that 46% of lesbians had been in a n abusive relationship at some point so I'm a bit confused by what the 55% actually means.   For queer groups we have to remember there are a lot of factors that can contribute to being abusive. Many queer people have additional challenges like bullying, homelessness, less access to resources, etc, all that can be triggers for abuse. So one should definitely not assume that just because it's two women, it's safer or abuse is less likely to occur. There is also ammunition-- for many people hiding being gay from some people is still important, so there's always the threat of outing someone. Bisexual people (an even more at risk population) have even higher rates of experiencing abuse, and I would not be surprised if that is also related."

TwoXChromosomes,3e0d2e,thestillnessinmyeyes,-8,Tue Jul 21 12:18:58 2015 UTC,"I read a similar report a while back. Because men are more likely to cause serious harm, their abuse tends to get taken more seriously, even if women do it more frequently."
TwoXChromosomes,3e0d2e,ohdatsrite,9,Tue Jul 21 15:18:59 2015 UTC,"man, it honestly sounds like you're trying to start a very vague fight about whose fault violence and harassment is. nobody wins those. this thread is about abuse in the military, and i would suggest staying relevant to that if you want to have a truly constructive conversation- it does deserve its own attention. there can be a good talk about the role women have in abusing other women in the army without turning it into ""well, women are just as violent as men in ways x, y, and z"". abuse is complicated enough- starting a discussion about all abuse like it's one big, unified problem is very likely going to end with everyone feeling unheard and frustrated."
TwoXChromosomes,3e0d2e,bubafina,-6,Tue Jul 21 17:46:41 2015 UTC,So discussing all abuse is going to end up with people feeling unheard and frustrated?  But discussing abuse that effects a particular group isn't going to end up with people feeling unheard and frustrated?
TwoXChromosomes,3e0d2e,CondorCalabasas,-1,Tue Jul 21 06:05:45 2015 UTC,"i meant that if you try to treat all abuse like it has one cause, or one kind of victim, or one kind of perpetrator, you're going to come to conclusions that unnecessarily simplify a very complex issue that has a lot to do with context. you have your own perspectives and priorities when discussing abuse, and somebody in very different circumstances is likely to have another. the broader and more sensitive the topic, the more likely you are to run into someone who's concerned with different things from you and really piss them off.  if we're talking about one specific kind of abuse, it's still not easy to talk about. however, it's a little easier to make sure everyone is on the same page and actually has enough context (or research) about the situation to draw some reasonable conclusions about what the causes and solutions might be. if you're thinking about domestic abuse AND workplace abuse AND abuse in the military AND child abuse all at once, or any random combination thereof, there can be very little specific, meaningful data found and no one conclusion to be reached because there isn't just one cause. men are victims and perpetrators and women are victims and perpetrators in abuse and violence, and without having any context for the discussion, it would be reductive and insulting to say ""all men do x"" or ""all women do y"" when it comes to violence or abuse on the whole."

So for you, I would say if you are usually going to sleep at 10AM, you should stay up as long as you can, try to make it to 8PM or 9PM at least, and then go to bed, wake up at 6AM or 7AM and then adjust the following day as needed. So, if you are trying to wake up to see your mom then maybe the next day go to bed at 9PM and wake up at 5AM?

Perhaps staying up all day and taking a 30 minute nap in the afternoon so you can last until 9 or 10pm is your best bet.

It could be everyone.   I would recommend, though, that you start with some kind of counselor or therapist.

It is actually a skill you learn from bitter experience and I doubt you have the capacity for it at this stage of your life.  You sound like a really good person for trying to help, but you get a pass on this one. It is going to get much worse before it gets better. If anything I would talk to your parents (assuming you have a good relationship, but it sounds like the raised you well) and let them know (without going into details) that your GF is having some challenges at the moment and you want to support her and you would like their support in turn.

You want to think you can change the world and make it a better place and things like this cut deep when you realise you can't. It is extremely difficult to watch someone you care about have to deal with this.

Drug use isn't much of a problem for most people. They simply use and cope.

TwoXChromosomes,3e0k9y,ChopsNZ,2,Tue Jul 21 02:11:57 2015 UTC,"Seven kids is a lot these days. I grew up with only three siblings and people asked if my parents were Catholic or against birth control. (No on both counts) but it's certainly not unheard of. What I'm reading into what you are saying (and tell me if I'm wrong) is that you are very uncomfortable with the idea of a large family and that is coloring your views of her mom. It's a theme you've been coming back to again and again.  Should she get help for her addiction? Absolutely. But I think you need to ask yourself also if you are able to respect this family's choices without letting it overshadow your understandable concern for the mom's addiction.  That aside- at your age and where you are in life the best option for you to be supportive of your girlfriend is the decidedly unfun (unless you like kids and being goofy with them) option of stepping in and helping make her life easier at home- offering to help with the dishes or make a date one where you take the younger siblings to a park or something. You don't have to be a dad, but you can be more of a fun uncle for them and take some of the stress of being The Big Sister off your girlfriend by being Big Sister's Fun Boyfriend. You didn't make this problem, so it's not your job to solve it, but if you really want to help your girlfriend (and I admire you for looking for solutions), bloonail's advice is good on what you can do now. Don't let one sentence put you off her ideas."

TwoXChromosomes,3e0k9y,ChopsNZ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:41:36 2015 UTC,I'm sorry you have to go through that. People either use for fun or to cope with some pretty horrendous stuff so for the most part are at opposite ends of the spectrum. The fun users generally cause no problems for themselves or others. The copers  need a shit ton of help and support but they cut a swathe through other peoples lives before they get it and by that time most people are totally over it.
TwoXChromosomes,3e09bs,teddyit,3,Mon Jul 20 23:28:51 2015 UTC,"Hi Teddyit,  I was home-schooled most of my life, and that mostly consisted of me sitting at home alone going through books, playing on the internet, and watching tv.  I know exactly how you feel, I lost all of my childhood friends, they were just way to into things I wasn't, and I was into things they had zero interest in.  When I started working, and going to college it helped a bit, I was able to make friendships. I am extremely introverted, which lead to making friends slowly, and I still feel much more comfortable on my own than around my peers...  I know how hard this is for you, it is really a rough time. I would like to say it all gets better, and for you it probably will once you get into college.   If you want to chat you can message me on the side and we can talk, but I felt like throwing out there that I was in the same situation you are now, and got through it okay, for the most part. (Except for my tendency to write run-on sentences..)  Best of luck!"
TwoXChromosomes,3e09bs,DukeZeme,3,Tue Jul 21 00:24:41 2015 UTC,"aw, lady, that's a hard feeling. what I thought reading this, though, wasn't anything like ""homeschooling broke this child and now she can't make/keep friends!""- it was ""damn, it's awesome she got away from those friends before she adapted and started thinking that being boring and getting fucked up all the time was a normal thing to do"". you had a chance to spend time with yourself and figure out what YOU are all about, not just what you're willing to go along with so things aren't awkward, and that's so, so valuable! you sound very aware of yourself and what you want in the best ways. most people really struggle to do that later in life, and it's not surprising that this may have set you apart a little from old friends that haven't gotten there yet. college will be great for you! also, speaking as someone who got their first kiss at 18- you are not doomed on that front either, and i didn't have homeschool as an excuse. :P"
TwoXChromosomes,3e09bs,bubafina,2,Tue Jul 21 05:43:29 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you, I totally and completely understand how you're feeling. I've been there so many times and have felt so alone and like no one cared and it's a really shitty place to be. For me it happened in high school, then again in college when I felt like I had lost everyone and everything and like no one really cares unless I was of service to them and they needed me around. One thing that really helped me has been learning spirituality- there's so many keys about your emotional, mental, and physical health hidden in it and it's interesting to research just to learn a little about. Meditation has been wonderful (tons of YouTube videos) just to clear the air.  I will say once you get to college you will thrive- I can feel it. College is a place for new beginnings- to meet tons of new people and to be whoever you want with total freedom to do, say, and be apart of anything. Find things to join and meet all the people you can! It's so great!!!! As for boys- 17 year old guys are idiots anyways so you aren't missing out. You'll find one and get everything you've ever wanted I promise. I didn't find a great guy until college, and we've been together for 2 years- my first real relationship and it was so worth waiting. Plus boys are mentally 3 years behind girls anyways so just wait to find someone who meets you on your level. Until then focus on loving yourself and self improvement. Find things you enjoy doing and do all you can to kill the time before College- the time will fly by naturally anyways :)   Sending you light and love! The universe does everything for a reason so work hard to find the light in your situation. There's people out there always willing to help and listen :) and Above all else- love yourself."
TwoXChromosomes,3e09bs,ket34,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:26:04 2015 UTC,"Sounds really typical of homeschooled kids I've known.  I'd give you a long and drawn out train of thought, but...  College will probably level out your social life really well, especially if you can get into some groups of people there to have reasonable fun and learn.  It's probably going to be awkward at first but if you just take it day by day; you'll probably connect enough to have friends within a few months or so.  If nothing else works; study groups will help you academically and shared class-misery usually greases the wheels of getting-to-know people."

It took me six years, and the first time I could only say, ""some people would call that rape.""  Even then it was only because someone got me angry and defensive enough while I was exhausted and hypoglycemic enough and I just sort of said it. I didn't tell him it was the first time I'd said it, but I thanked him for helping in his own way.   I started saying it more, slowly. First to my partner, then to a couple of old friends who happened to mention my rapist. It felt so empowering to finally say it, be believed, and to really know it was true.  That was about 18 months ago. I really can't believe the progress I've made since then. My shame and rage became productivity and focus. I still seethe once in a while, but I don't have trouble getting out of bed anymore and I don't constantly need two hour baths where I stare off into space. Life is good."

Abnormal cells can be be anywhere from mild to severe and there are different strains. Mine causes no symptoms like warts and HPV (or abnormal cells) doesn't always mean cancer (and that can take years to develop). There even the possibility that there's nothing going on at all. Take the time to educate yourself before panicking: http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv.htm.

I think the best thing you can do for yourself is not to lose your education because of that a hole. Be safe,  carry pepper spray or something especially if you could end up around him again. Some times life is very unjust. To give him any more of your life will hurt you.  It will take time,  get therapy,  learn self defense,  attend a group for survivors of rape, whatever helps you gain back your power. It can make you stronger,  you will never forget but you can heal and choose to live.    Good bless you sister."

TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,quimmical,966,Sun Jul 19 17:58:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, sweetheart, I'm so incredibly sorry this happened to you.   Guilt is a normal thing to feel, and it's useless to tell you that you shouldn't. What I'd like you to do, however, is to tell yourself every day that you didn't take anyone away. You did not deprive your mother of her husband, he did that. You did not deprive your brother of a father, he did that too. And, most importantly, he never let you have a real father, only one who was also an abuser, and this is the worst thing of them all.   Please, please, if you aren't already doing it, keep in contact with your school counselor and stay in therapy. You're going through a terrible time, and you have been through some really messed up stuff. Therapy will give you the tools to process it in a healthy way.   I can tell you that this feelings will pass. You will probably feel very, very angry. It will be terrible, but you can also use that anger to do so many things, to reinvent yourself as a girl who has great grades and volunteers and does sports. Things are awful right now, but you can and you will get on the other side as a new, even stronger person. I have no doubt of it, because you have been brave as hell in speaking with your counselor and telling your mother.  Even if you doubt it now, I'm 100% convinced that you made the right choice. I'm sending you hugs."

TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,canigetamilkshakeplz,82,Sun Jul 19 21:20:33 2015 UTC,"Ditto, please. Please, therapy did me a world of good. You deserve to feel safe, you deserve to feel loved, and you deserve to have that and more in healthy relationships. A parent's job includes protecting their children. He broke that trust. I understand your conflicted feelings, more than most would.   My stepfather( who raised me as his own from 2) broke that trust. He turned himself into the police, because he realized that. I'm sharing that because I want you to know that there's more to life, a really great life with good relationships that is possible after this. A month from now I'm marrying a man who knows all this and more about me, and loves me as a I am. He and I respect each other, have healthy boundaries, and I realized I could marry him when I felt that I wouldn't be afraid for our future children.  OP, please know that you are strong. You will heal. It doesn't mean you'll forget the good and bad. It just means that one day, you'll have had enough good days to outweigh those bad ones. I swear this is true. Please keep up with therapy. Please show yourself compassion. It's okay to feel conflicted, it's okay to feel whatever you feel in each moment. This doesn't have to be your identity, you choose what will be your identity. You can choose to move forward and build a happy, healthy life that your father before he crossed those lines would have wanted for you. ( I know some would downvote for that, but there were two sides of him unfortunately). You can choose to feel sad for the dad you had as a kid before puberty is gone, and be grateful that you're safe. These might feel paradoxical, but it's normal in this situation.   Please know we care for you. You are not alone. You will move through this. Your family can move through this. Please take 13RunawayTurtles' advice. Take care of yourself."

I just want to add that if you can, as far as insurance networks allow, always find a different therapist if you're not thrilled with the one you have now. Its extremely important to really feel good about the one you're seeing. Maybe it's nothing to do with his/her abilities, just that you don't ""click"" with them. And that's ok. Just like trying different medications for whatever ailment until you find the one that works best for you. You should find a therapist that you feel comfortable with."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,Schizo-frenzy,118,Mon Jul 20 17:15:11 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ. Please know none of this is your fault, okay? I think we're the same age(15/16?) and while I never suffered exactly like you have, I know what you mean.   My stepdad got mad at my boyfriend one day for hugging me and molested me that night. He was telling me it was because me loved me and wanted me to know how I was supposed to be treated. Eventually it went from him groping me to raping me.   I didn't tell anyone for months, same as you. My mom wouldn't believe me. My dad probably wouldn't. I'd rip the family apart, he'd lose his job, etc.   I told my stepmom in January, and I wasn't allowed back at my mom's house. The day after I went to give my statement my stepfather disappeared and was found with a bullet in his head the next day.   Now my family is either a mess, blames me, or pretends it doesn't happen(my mom says he died of a brain hemorrhage). You're not alone, okay? And I can't promise you you'll be better soon because it doesn't always work that way. But you learn to put it in the back of your mind and how to fight back when it feels like it's taking over. Counseling is your friend-I've been going for months now for PTSD.   PM me if you ever want to talk, rant, hell just ask random questions about each other's days, I like making friends. You're not alone.   Edit: I should add, I never got my justice either. His note actually told us all he only wanted my mom and I to have a good relationship. Especially bittersweet since he was a cop-it'll be on my mind for the rest of my life that he could've done things to others, and I could've stopped it if I had said something sooner.   Extra edit: I realized I never said anything about your ex. To be honest, while I haven't gone through exactly that(although I do have 'friends' who asked me why I led him on), I know how you feel. Confused, angry, maybe a bit guilty? Really not your fault chica, no one asks for this to happen to them. If he wants to ask you how you could 'cheat' on him, I want you to realize that a year or two from now he could be the man who gets mad when you hang out with friends from work, get too friendly with other students, etc. It's horrible that you had to find out this way and I'm sorry you don't have an SO's support, but he would've been poisonous for you overtime. I've kept telling myself the one good thing about everything that happens? You find out who cares about you because they're obligated to, and who genuinely wants you to be okay.   Triple edit and I promise I'll stop: The ""I took her husband away, and his father away?"" You might feel like that for a while. On hard days I still do. Hell, it'll only take seeing my mom struggle with cleaning out the pool(always my stepdads job) or turn around to see my brother living in our guest bedroom because he's scared to be upstairs alone(we both used to sleep over there, but since my mom and I went way south I only go over there a few days a week). And other people might try and keep you thinking this way. Three days before his wake(I went for closure), my grandma informed me I wasn't allowed to go during the main service because I'd 'cause a scene'-which to her, is being upfront about why the son of the botch had a brain hemorrhage all of a sudden. I also got yelled at for refusing to wear black. My mom's guilted me for three months now because I made her get rid of his car-1. I'm never sitting in the same place he shot himself, 2. The only memories I have in that car and him begging and threatening me not to tell. You're going to have mostly good people to stand by you, but sometimes there's a few who just don't understand why you won't move past it already or forgive him. It's especially hard when those people are family. But in my fathers words: ""You're old enough to start setting boundaries with family and to point out they crossed the line. If someone's going to be a bitch and ignore that? .....they lost the privilege of being in your life."""

At 15, homework and grades were my main concern.   Basically those abusive situations suck for everyone involved. But for the record I'm not trying to excuse the guy for saying something stupid.

People who are ignorant or immature often can't understand repeated abuse in particular, especially when it's someone the victim knows and not the (more rare) stranger rape that we hear about commonly on the news. They wonder why the victim didn't just tell someone or fight back the first time it happened. Because they  ""let it"" keep happening, then maybe that means they were consenting or actually enjoyed it. People who say stuff like this just do not understand that there are complex psychological, physical, and even logistical factors that come into play. Most abusers/assaulters/rapists have an insane ability to manipulate their victims. It is extremely difficult to put a stop to those situations, and OP should still be proud of herself for doing that, even thought the outcome did not turn out as she hoped.   OP's boyfriend is probably one such immature and ignorant person, so he got upset and misunderstood the situation when he heard how long this abuse had been going on. In his eyes, he felt betrayed because OP was having a sexual relationship with someone else (in her family, no less) without doing anything to stop it the entire time they were together and she didn't tell him. So he either doesn't fully understand why it was NOT consensual, or he is just a total scumbag. Again, this is WRONG of him and I am not trying to defend him, but rather just explain what his logic might have been at the time for those who are doubting OP because they don't believe that anyone would say this.  Even if she can't see it now, OP dodged a bullet by breaking up with that guy. She will indeed have a positive future, and I'm sure one day she will be with someone who is mature and compassionate and deserving of her love."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,dateadvicethrowawy,2,Mon Jul 20 07:08:35 2015 UTC,"I think kids need to be taught about these things, either by parents or in school. Otherwise you're just taking everything the child/teenager has experienced - movies, Internet, comedians, whatever friends say - and you're saying ""okay, give me an opinion about incest and sexual crimes, based on that"". Not everyone is going to realize the seriousness of sexual crimes, or that they are even a real thing.  I remember being taught about sexual crimes and especially incest in school when I was 9, and not understanding much of it. I couldn't realize that these are things that actually happen,  but I knew it was important that I call the police or tell the school when me or a friend lived through that."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,DenkouNova,2,Mon Jul 20 13:14:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, that guy needs some major live lessons. Also a crash course on how to not be a complete idiot and douchebag.  I'm a guy too and I, in his position would've (or at least tried to) beat the shit out of her father or at the very least actively tried to get her outta there/ away from her father.

TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,throwaways_all_day,158,Sun Jul 19 18:10:01 2015 UTC,"The fact that he's gone is 100% due to his cowardice and abusiveness, and nothing to do with you. The choice to take his life was completely on him, and it was the coward's way out. Instead of taking responsibility for the fucked up things he did, he once again took advantage of you and left the mess for you to deal with. He may be dead, but he's still abusing you.  Don't let him."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,binford2k,21,Sun Jul 19 21:38:54 2015 UTC,"Even if he hadn't committed suicide, would OP have wanted to be around him? What if he had lived and fought the case and tried to color the abuse as consensual, simultaneously ruining OP's reputation and her life? While I'm sure the guilt is horrible and pressing right now, but in the future I'm sure she'll be glad that he's gone."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,flawlessqueen,26,Mon Jul 20 02:25:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have gone the ""send him to prison"" route, and you still feel like you've taken away your brother's dad and ripped apart your family.  But with the bonus of a lifetime of fear of running into him after he gets out of prison, and hoping he will hurry up and die so you can finally feel safe.  I have met women in survivor groups who were in their 50s and still living with that fear.    It's fucked up but from where I'm standing, OP's dad offing himself is a gift."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,outofshell,19,Mon Jul 20 03:56:33 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. His suicide is a confession. it's much better than the lies and slander he could spew in court and afterwards.

TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,flawlessqueen,3,Mon Jul 20 04:03:43 2015 UTC,"That was my immediate thought--someone who did not abuse his daughter wouldn't kill himself merely upon the accusation.

TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,catching_up,5,Mon Jul 20 03:58:56 2015 UTC,"You're missing the issue that is now created though. Because of the suicide the brother and mother may have trouble coping, and may even doubt the daughters claims.  That's going to be the hardest part. Because (from what I read) it's all heresay. Hopefully (for the truth's sake), the brother and mother actually did notice things, and can back up the daughter.  But you've got to be able to see this from the brother and mothers perspective, and how their view may put the daughter in a worse position than if the suicide never occurred.  What if the brother and mother get into denial? What if the brother and mother don't back up the daughter and consider her to be making it up?   Without closure this could be messy, which is really, really crap for everyone."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,mootmeep,5,Mon Jul 20 04:05:04 2015 UTC,"Isn't his suicide enough of a confession?   I mean, how often does someone kill themselves after being accused of a crime they didn't do, when there is no evidence that they didn't do it?  Obviously incestuous sex crimes involving minors are different, but still.  Besides that, hadn't he announced to the family that he (her father) would be ""helping her shower"" when she turned 11/12?"
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,flawlessqueen,5,Mon Jul 20 04:11:00 2015 UTC,"Oh I absolutely agree. I'm just pointing out that in many cases, the remaining family members have a nagging sense of ""is she really telling the truth?""  either out of denial, or ignorance, or simply being oblivious.   Isn't his suicide enough of a confession?    What is ""enough""?  It's not enough for a court of law, it certainly wouldn't be called conclusive evidence, it puts a lot of weight to it, but it doesn't remove all doubt.  I could easily imagine a family member, or a wife thinking, ""No, he could never do that, this must be out of shame""  or whatever. My point is even if we disagree we must recognise that people do have these thoughts, and how do we best address them?"
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,mootmeep,3,Mon Jul 20 04:35:53 2015 UTC,"The court of law stuff doesn't matter anymore. He's dead. There's no one to throw in jail, no one that needs his children protected from him. As her mother and brother are not the victims (as far as we know), I'm not concerned with them. What happened was the best thing that could have happened for her. She never has to live in fear of her father trying to touch her, initiate sex with her, coerce her, blackmail her ever again.  If her mother and brother don't believe her, shame on them."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,flawlessqueen,3,Mon Jul 20 04:39:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sure, that's all given.  But don't you have concern for the daughters life if her mother and brother turn against her? Or even on a lesser scale, what if they doubt her?  I'm saying we need to extend some thought and compassion for those likelihoods. We can't just say ""well if her mother and brother don't believe her then fuck them"". They're her mother and brother, her family, it's important to manage relationships and try to recover some sense of family."

You have done nothing wrong. No really, you have to believe us. Nothing is your fault.   You are young and a victim of abuse.

Seek therapy from an independent professional; ask your mother, your school or even the police who have support professionals or who can at least point you in the right direction. You took nothing from no-one. In this scenario the adult is always at fault. Always. You had to stop the abuse and you did. The biggest gift you can give your mother and brother is to survive and grow and deal with what he took from you. They are responsible for their own grief. Together you will all survive and be closer. Promise."

You can go on from here and live an amazing life. Your dad is not around anymore to hurt you or hold you back.

There are so many options out there for you to get help and speak with people who understand, and I am sure they have been presented to you and more will be today.

There is no nuance or grey area. You are not at fault for his actions and you are a victim.  An amazing person who survived that horrible abuse.  There will be people who will blame you, but those people are wrong.

You don't mention it, so I don't know if this applies to you or not. BUT just in case this has happened to you (and it has happened to PLENTY of other people who were molested or raped), I want you to know that if you ever felt arousal when he was molesting you, that is not your fault either.

TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,GandalfTheGrey1991,10,Sun Jul 19 23:21:23 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to respond because, while my understanding of this situation is so little in comparison, I also was raped by a man much older than myself as a young adult. I've never gone after him because I'm unsure how to classify my assault (it was more a form of human trafficking – I was left with a group of men in a city where I knew no one for 5 days by my then-boyfriend who likely sold me to them) and can't be weak like that ever again. The man who effected me most was the leader of the gang and was between 65-75. I was 18.   The thing I struggle with most, which most people can't understand, is that he took my innocence. He took a little girl and showed her the world was an ugly, perverted place. He showed me a photo of his two grandchildren and I will never forget how much I lost in that single moment. He not only made my male friends threats, he made their fathers and grandfathers threats as well. I felt the eyes of old men on me everywhere I went, and still notice it quite often.  Before... It never would've crossed my mind that my best guy friend's father might be thinking about screwing my brains out. But afterwards, for years, every man I encountered was a threat and everything was grayed over, drowning me in blackness. I lost everything that I was that day, and never saw the girl I was at 18 ever again. She couldn't survive in a world where that could happen.  It's been 8 years now, and the fear and anger still consumes me at time. For 5 years following, I felt broken. Destroyed beyond repair. I referred to myself as ""damaged goods"" and thought I'd always be that way.   I never repaired myself, but I did create a new self. I'm not going to give you the talk about how life is butterflies and rainbows, but the one thing I did learn is that there is beauty in me and my ability to understand myself and change myself. I'm my own project, and even when I don't see the progress, every month I get a little bit better, a little bit stronger.   I thought I was dead after the first assault, thought I didn't care what happened to me anymore, but I did. I did every night I was with them when I hugged myself tight; I did when I whispered to myself in the dark ""You'll be okay""; I did every time I cried for what happened to me, when I allowed myself to feel the fear, when I'd scream in the middle of the night with rage... I did when I started making plans for myself and who I wanted to be again, and when I found the strength inside of me to create who I became. I thought I'd died, but I stilled cared, even then. Or someone inside me did, at least; someone stronger than the girl I was then who was willing to fight for a dead girl.   That ""someone"" – that fierce, zealous person – that's who I've become. My anger, fear, pain, terror fueled my effort to repair myself and I did, eventually. And that process, that success became what life was about to me. My strength brought me happiness when nothing else could.   Two years ago, I met my boyfriend. It was the first time I'd felt safe, not just since the assault, but in my whole life. The first day we met I spent the night, just cuddling, and I never left. Four months in, I had a strange surprise when I discovered I was suddenly nervous about flying, crossing the road, skydiving, driving in the rain. I'd never feared death until he entered my life. Now I know what it is to want to live and exist.   The bad moments still come, and you could even say they're frequent; I cry at least once a week. But he is always there, and I'm...better. As he said about me a week ago, with him no day is ever wasted. We're so alike and drive each other to be better, stronger, smarter people. I don't believe in a god or anything like that, but it's like the world came to even out the ways I'd been wronged in my life. Today, my life is once again in balance.   I don't know how long it's been since your father's suicide, but something will make things right again for you. You have many, many years to go and the girl you are or were will become removed from you with time till she's barely recognizable. I'm now at the point where I'm letting go of what happened. It no longer defines me; it's no longer really important. I don't need to talk about what happened everyday anymore just to breathe.   In two years, I'll hit 10 years since the incident. Supposedly your cells are replaced every 10 years. In two more years, no part of me will ever have been touched by the person who stole my youth. I leave you with that, because it was one of the few comforts I found. I send my best to you. You'll make it, I promise you."

I hope you are able to cope and live a full and happy life. In the end, our worst experiences can make us stronger. Don't let this bring you down. Use the experience to lift yourself up. Maybe you can help people who have gone through similar experiences."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,milkbug,5,Sun Jul 19 23:45:39 2015 UTC,None of this is your fault. He took advantage of you and he knew it was wrong. He may have been a nice person to the rest of his family but it is how he acted with you that negates all of that. He made those decisions and he took away your brother's father and your mom's husband. There is nothing that makes up for the way he treated you and none of it is your fault at all. I am so sorry you have this guilt but I am happy you are safe now. The feelings may never go away completely but time will help. You are not alone in this.
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,tallhokiegirl,5,Sun Jul 19 23:59:51 2015 UTC,"You have done nothing wrong. What he did was a horrible and disgusting thing which, I feel, you realised long ago. His death may have brought sadness and grief to your family but it was wrong for them to live with a man who was quite different from whom they thought they knew. If ever you need help you can always contact your school counselor, the police or any other authorities. You are not, and will not ever be, alone.   My thoughts are with you, stay strong and stay true to yourself. You are a good person with nothing to regret, don't ever let this change you. Nothing can change a strong person, and by putting up with all of that for so long is proof enough that you are incredibly strong. It won't be easy to forget, but time can heal all wounds. Hang in there, you'll make it eventually :-) xx"
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,ElusiveDagger,5,Mon Jul 20 00:01:17 2015 UTC,"oh, kid you had to grow up way too fast. you had to learn to make decisions nobody should ever have to make, at any age. I don't know how to say this any other way, but you have to survive. You will have to fight everyday these feelings and thoughts. The pain doesn't get any easier, nor does it ever go away completely but you will get stronger and you will learn to deal with this pain by making small advances in your life that turn into meaningful moments and you will overcome this. I cannot emphasize enough how you should not go through this alone. Find someone to talk to. Independent of everything this is the most important thing right now. Write it down, go outside, and breathe. You did it! You survived this and it's not anyone's fault you had to go through it, except maybe your father, and perhaps your mother, for not seeking help when there were clearly visible warning signs. He desperately needed help and he expressed that in the most negative way possible, to his child. You did not ask for this, nor does he own you because he is your parent. You, your mom, and brother are all victims of abuse. But this is not your fault nor is it your responsibility to bear. You have essentially suffered a war and are now left to pick up the pieces. You won't get any answers or people asking you for forgiveness. You will suffer people who will get mad at you for ""bringing up"" what he did as if what he did to you was part of your job as a child. There will be times when your mom may look at you and tell you it's  your fault. Don't you ever believe this. Just remember it's your job to survive, that's it. You don't ever have to forgive anyone for anything if you don't want to."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,thunderbutt76,4,Mon Jul 20 00:13:01 2015 UTC,I have a 16 yr old daughter.  I wanted to downvote the post cause my eyes are filled with hate towards your father and i forgot it is about your pain.  No offense.  Just I wanna grab a man like that up.  I couldn;t read the whole thing out of my disgust for him and desire to see you  find protection from this again.  i am so sorry for you.
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,twistdmentat,2,Mon Jul 20 00:31:39 2015 UTC,take all the help you can get to set this right IMO
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,twistdmentat,4,Mon Jul 20 00:32:33 2015 UTC,"I too am victim of abuse. The pain will, unfortunately, never go away. But you will endure. It can even empower you. I have no other words for you, not now anyways, but I am here if you need to talk."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,jibsand,4,Mon Jul 20 00:42:35 2015 UTC,"Your story tells me that despite all the hurt and pain and cruelty, your judgment is completely sound. Don't ever forget that.  I'm a father of two daughters and the unfairness of it all breaks my heart. If there's ever anything I can do to help, or just to talk, let me know.  I'm sure that goes for almost anyone here."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,updn,30,Mon Jul 20 01:14:36 2015 UTC,"My heart breaks for you. You should never have had to deal with the situations he put you in, both before his death and now. This is not your fault in any way. He messed up big time and then left you to deal with it. There is no right or wrong way to feel about this. It is complicated.   Embracing the pain of it all and working through it is the only way to eventually let go of it. Find a therapist (if you haven't already) to help you speed up the emotional healing process. You will always have scars from this but you are not broken. It is important to remember that you are responsible for your own fate. You still have a life to live. Don't let what happened to you ruin your one-and-only life. It won't be easy but nothing worth doing is easy.  I have a family member who went through something similar. She gave up. She let it be her excuse to not try anymore. She is 30 now. She can't keep a job or even a friendship. She wasn't able to get help after everything that happened to her when she was young. She was never able to work through the emotional damage that it did and so she still carries around an open wound. She is quick to blame everything that is wrong with her life on what happened. She is right, in a way. If it had never happened then her life would be different. She would be different. But you can't let what happened to you define your life.  You can never change what happened. It will always be a part of you but it doesn't have to be all of you. You are so much more than what happened to you. Chose what else makes up who you are and focus on those things. The more you experience, the more you will grow. Always, always, always keep growing and working on yourself. Figure out what you want to do with your life. Focus on healing yourself and making your goals happen. Do not let this shit define you. You get to pick what defines you. Go out there and give your life everything you've got. Rock this life despite the shit you've had to face."

She is 30 now. She can't keep a job or even a friendship.    Fuck you, obviously you don't know what it's like to go through years of abuse and fear, it's not an excuse. I'm happy for people who are able to move on, but don't talk shit on others that haven't. This is not something your cousin choose to. It's easy for you to talk motivational bullshit, when crazy stuff like this happened it's not something you chose to ""define you"" or not. People have nightmares about it, nervous breakdowns, even PTSD and things you cannot control."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,SpaceTortoise,7,Mon Jul 20 01:07:07 2015 UTC,"Look, if you think OP was wrong, you are worse. As a victim I can say that one of the worst fears in my life was that I would always be a victim, always tainted, always broken. That was a huge part of the devastation.   Knowing and believing that I could move on from it and have a healthy life played a huge role in my slow journey back to feeling clean and balanced again. So, stop being rude alright.   People don't have to have their whole lives and futures dictated by their past. It's okay to grieve and go through that process or recovery. But it is not okay to throw your hands up and give up.  EDIT: anyway. Let's not turn this into a shit show. OP needs our community's support. Not for us to turn on each other."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,mishmash27,10,Mon Jul 20 02:11:05 2015 UTC,"I said I'm  happy for people who can move on but let's not look down at people who are still having difficulties. The commenter is talking down at her cousin for it. I really want everyone to heal and be happy and there's plenty of people that can, but don't go around saying abuse victims are using it as an excuse, okay. Read my comment first before saying I'm a lot worse, idk what the heck you get that from. I specially quote OP and I'm talking about the way she's talking about her cousin that it's still having difficulties."

She is 30 now. She can't keep a job or even a friendship.   I'm confused. Is this person dead or not? Given up, that makes me think suicide. 30 now, can't keep a job or friendship; that sounds like your talking about a living person. Which is it? Or is there some 'healing time limit' that the rest of the world doesn't know about?  I hope for your family members' sake that you don't give her the same back handed encouragement.  Your choice of words exposes your own pain and fear. Deal with that before you try helping others.  edit: I'm sorry I ignored the positive parts of your message, and for picking on the same lines SpaceTortoise already lectured you on. Thank you for the effort you put into helping others, you have a lot of good things to say. I'm not going to delete my comment and pretend it didn't happen but I will make an effort to check my own hostility next time. <3"

I wish that none of this had ever happened, but you did what was right and the worst that could happen, happened. I hope there is ongoing support for you, your mom and brother. Please try to find support, if you don't have it already. I wish there had been some support for your father so he could get the counseling he needed to come to the realization of his evil deeds and turn from them. I want to believe he would have begged you for forgiveness.  I hope that you can find the people you need to support you through all this. You did nothing, nothing, nothing wrong. The world is a broken place, and I wish it wasn't but it is. I hate it when an Innocent like you is abused by someone who should have loved you innocently.  I pray you will find peace."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,soeob,3,Sun Jul 19 23:02:29 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry. I truly hope you find some sort of peace after this. You've done absolutely nothing wrong.
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,sunglasses619,3,Mon Jul 20 00:30:59 2015 UTC,"I'm so, so sorry this happened to you. I'm actually amazed that you are able to relay your story like this, that must have taken such an emotional toll.  I am dealing with a similar ongoing situation in my past. I'm not sure how to deal with it because, like you said, there's no feeling of closure or justice. I feel very unprotected in the world sometimes. Like you, I was blamed by the person who was supposed to protect me.  I don't know if you heard this but I got a lot of 'living well is the best revenge' and 'don't give him power over you', which was a well meaning but counterproductive message, so I have big gaps of memory and blank emotions. For a long time I thought I was untouchable and resistant to emotions, not realizing that intimacy issues, dissociation, horrible self image (that just felt 'matter-of-fact') and eating disorders were products of my experience.  I hope that you can get help with your situation. It seems like you have a clear narrative and are able to elucidate a lot of what happened. I wish you the best of luck and hope that you can work through these memories. <3"
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,alien_infiltrator429,2,Mon Jul 20 01:10:43 2015 UTC,"You didnt do shit, your father was a lying coward and fucked his own family up just to get off."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,khanabadoshi,3,Mon Jul 20 02:00:04 2015 UTC,"You can take what I say with a grain of salt as I'm a 28 y/o male, and what I say may not be of any help or authority.   I found your experiences incredibly profound. Society likes to paint evil as all-consuming. Reality is the opposite. ""The abuse is over, but my daddy is dead."" That line will strike a nerve with many people. The sum-total of your father isn't an abuser. Your father was still just your father at times -- It's hard for others to understand that -- it's hard for them to see why you struggle with just totally hating/disowning/forgetting him. Based on your timeline, I assume you are in your mid to late teens... it's a confusing time even if life is perfect. Don't be hard on yourself, the emotions are cyclical: Guilt - Anger for feeling Guilt - Hate - Guilt for hating - repeat. Just like laundry, the cycle will repeat until one day you feel/realize that the hate is for his actions towards you; the guilt was his own, and he acted on it -- and you will come out clean with love for yourself.   It is up to you and a very personal decision for which you owe no explanation to love or disown the good in your father -- but do not disown the innocence and love of yourself. At no point are you the cause of any event that transpired.   You are not bad, dirty, tainted, foolish, evil, unworthy; you are innocent, confused, sad, hurt, upset -- and that is exactly where you should be. No matter how big or small an incident in life, it is always from these states of being that a one rises to a level of contentment, self-respect and understanding, and ultimately happiness. Why? Because it is only in these states we really examine who we are.   I have great confidence that you will find the good in you."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,the1iwant,3,Mon Jul 20 02:24:15 2015 UTC,"As a father, I want to assure you that you have no reason to feel guilt.  His guilt and his own demons led to the suicide.  No dad (or any grown man or woman) should take advantage of a young child like this!  I'm so glad you found the strength to seek help.  Continue to find help from professional counselors, clergy, friends and family you can trust.  You and your family are in my prayers today!"
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,sicnevol,3,Mon Jul 20 11:16:34 2015 UTC,"I took away her husband. I took away my brother's father.    no sweetie, he did.  He was a grown ass man.

TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,Ashley777,6,Mon Jul 20 13:19:42 2015 UTC,"You acted very bravely. He was a coward. Trust me, it will get easier. You will think about it less and less as time passes. You get to live the whole rest of your life now. Find people to talk to."

TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,BlackCaaaaat,4,Sun Jul 19 22:21:04 2015 UTC,"It's easy for me to say that it wasn't your fault, and that you shouldn't feel guilt - I can see that clearly as an outsider. But it will take more than my words to truly erase the guilt that you feel. It will take time for you to get to the point where you honestly agree, deep down, that none of this is your fault.  Your feelings of guilt are further complicated by grief. Grief for the physical loss of your father, and grief for the loss of the 'good man' you thought he was before the abuse began. You have a lot of healing to do, and it will be much easier if you work with a good therapist.   I'm so sorry you've gone through this, I wish I could give you a big hug."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,HappierNowthrowaway,2,Sun Jul 19 23:49:28 2015 UTC,"OP: I'm sorry this happened to YOU. I'm sorry you feel the guilt for doing something you needed, absolutely needed to do for your own survival and the consequences afterwards.   The same thing happened to me. My father started in when I was very young - probably younger than 5. Even at such a young age it felt wrong. But my father was my everything and I absolutely loved him like all little girls with good fathers do. I separated his acts vs his ""fathering/normal"" side and when he wasn't abusing me sexually he was actually the ""perfect"" parent compared to my mother. It is a 100% mindfuck growing up like this. The one person who is your main support, your emotional life line, your parent is also abusing you and totally manipulating your love and dependence on them to satisfy their sickness.   When I was a freshman in high school he was already raping me by then. I was lucky he waited as long as he did and didn't try it when I was a smaller child. But he also abused my little brother and I couldn't see my own brother be abused also. So I turned him in. I broke up my whole family. Everyone in my own family hated me for it, accused me of lying and rejected me. I was kicked out of my house at 16. I testified against my father in a court in front of strangers and detailed every and all acts done against my person much to my humiliation and devastation. Afterwards I was told I was a brave amazing person. I did not feel like that at all. I went on a mental roller coaster for 15 years after that with clinical depression, feeling suicidal etc.   The only thing that saved me were a few good therapists I had the ability to see- that gave me true acceptance and compassion- and the man that is my husband.   After my father exited his prison sentence he came out a changed man. He was degenerated. He was mentally ill. They diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia and put him out on the street. My level of guilt seeing him so changed (he was a brilliant man) was crushing. I can only imagine how you feel since your father made the ultimate choice. I am still haunted by the guilt ...I still sometimes occasionally think to myself sick thoughts like ""if I had only just done whatever he wanted- maybe he would have been happier at the end of his life"".   But it's all wrong. Our fathers made their choices knowing FULL WELL IT IS WRONG AND THEY ARE WRONG. I have four beautiful children now and that is the most heartbreaking thing in the world to experience sometimes for children like us- seeing our own children and finally realizing FULLY how wretched a world we live that our own parents were willing to brutalize our own childhoods.   I'm so sorry OP- please please get help. Get therapy, cry when you need to, it's ok if you have to do things to feel safe, if you don't want to be in a relationship for a long time, if you feel badly, just get the help you need and in time things will get better. Give yourself a chance please."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,nofaprecommender,3,Sun Jul 19 22:35:43 2015 UTC,"Holy shit. Big internet hug for you. That is the worst kind of betrayal. Like everyone else says, it's definitely not your fault. Also, the idea that you made the 100% right choice might be hard to accept. If you have trouble believing that, just believe that you made a choice that was valid as any other. You made a choice to protect yourself in a situation where no one else could protect you. It wasn't your choice that hurt your family and caused all this chaos, it was all the many, many choices that your father made, each time he chose to continue this behavior."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,spikyman,2,Mon Jul 20 00:10:09 2015 UTC,"Old guy here. No child deserves what you are going through. This ugly experience will always be part of you, but please, please do whatever you can to not let it define you."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,keylimesoda,3,Mon Jul 20 00:16:46 2015 UTC,"You had a father who was broken.  And he tried to break you, and you wouldn't let him.  You saved yourself, and likely others that he would have abused in the future.  His decision to leave is heartbreaking, but that was him unable to face the truth of who he was.  And that truth was something he created, not you.  Your mother loves you, your brother loves you, and despite all that you've experienced, you've retained some dignity and self-respect as well.  Be patient with yourself, allow yourself to be sick and sad and grieve.  Take support where you can find it (even here online).  You may never figure it all out, but you'll eventually build your own life and move on."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,lyrassistance,2,Mon Jul 20 00:28:33 2015 UTC,"You didn't do anything wrong. He did the wrong by touching you inappropriately. He did the wrong by trying to keep it a secret knowing that it was wrong. He did the wrong by taking the easy way out and not facing his exposed inappropriate behaviour like a man. He did the wrong by not being a father to you; the loving, caring father you deserved to have. He did the wrong by putting all of this on you. You have every right to feel angry at him but for the love of god do not feel angry at yourself. Be angry at him and find some way to turn that anger into something productive, something useful. Find a conduit that you can use to vent this anger and cope with it. You never should have had to go through this, especially alone but you are free now. A new life starts here for you. I can tell from your post that you are a strong person and I know you will get through this."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,ShadowPuppetGov,2,Mon Jul 20 00:33:16 2015 UTC,"I told the guy I was dating at the time about the abuse. We'd been together for over a year, so I thought he'd be able to help me get through this. His response wasn't what I expected at all. ""Wow.. you are cheating on me with your father? You were fucking your dad behind my back?"" I was shocked. He ended up breaking up with me.   This guy did not care about you. I guarantee when you told him this he thought ""This is way more than I signed up for"" and made up an excuse so he could get out of the relationship. He blamed you because he didn't want to face the fact that he was too weak to help you with your problem. He could have gotten you help, even if he didn't want to deal with your problem. Instead he broke up with you and told you it was your fault, because it was easy, because it preserved his ego.  He was worthless. You are straight up better off without him. It's a good thing he broke up with you.  edit:typo"
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,yamiryukia330,2,Mon Jul 20 00:41:17 2015 UTC,"first of all NONE of this was your fault in anyway. DON""T blame yourself for his suicide that was his choice and no one elses. he was a monster who couldn't control himself and hurt you very badly in the process.   the abuse was not your fault and i would have wanted to destroy the boyfriend because in no way were you cheating on him because you didn't consent to any of the abuse.   i'm sorry but i can't think of anything else to say except that this isn't your fault and i can't believe your mother betrayed you like that. i offer internet hugs if you'd like them."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,eggandchicken14,2,Mon Jul 20 00:45:50 2015 UTC,"Hi, you are so strong. I want you to know that you have done nothing wrong and as others have said, the repercussions of this situation are all on your father for committing these heinous acts on someone he was supposed to protect. I'd also like to let you know that you are not alone and I highly recommend getting someone to talk to (a professional honestly, it seems like your mother isn't the best person to speak to about this) because you have endured years of abuse. If you are hit by a car and are badly injured, you would need to go to the hospital and enter rehabilitation programs to get better. This is the same thing; something horrible and out of your control happened to you and you are badly hurt and you need to get better. I'd like to give my mother as an example that I don't recommend you follow: her situation was nearly identical to yours and she did not receive the help she needed until very recently (she is 42 now) and this was only after she internalized it all and had a severe mental breakdown. I'd give everything to reverse what happened to her or at least get her the help she needed immediately after it happened. I want to do the same for you... If a professional isn't available, I could provide you with contact information because I think it is so important you speak with someone... Again, you are so strong for telling your story. I only wish the best for you in your life."

You must seek out and continue therapy for a very long time, this has taken much from your life.  3. You must not feel guilty for ANY of it. Your father did what he did because of guilt and knowing that what he did was very wrong  I wish you all the best and hope that you find peace and true love in your life. You deserve it."

This bit at the end disturbed me though:    She believed me, but can't believe the man she loved so much could do such a thing.  By the time I was 12, he started assisting me when I took showers. My mom thought nothing of it when he announced he was going to.   It seems to me she knew something was going on by the fact he was going to help you shower and she didn't comment on it. To me it would ring a bell or two and make me go ""what"". How could she think it was appropriate for her husband to feel the need to help his daughter shower."

The problem is, we can say it over and over again but it won't register until you really believe it and that will likely take a while. A piece of wisdom I'd like to impart on you is that everyone is responsible for their own actions. When someone says, ""You made me do it"", they're just too much of a coward and too power hungry to be accountable for their own actions. Your father was unfortunately a disgusting coward who took the easy way out because he KNEW his actions were wrong and didn't want to take responsibility for any of it. YOU ARE IN NO WAY TO BLAME.   Please ask your mother to take you to therapy so you can get past this time in your life. You deserve a full, happy life. Don't let him get his way, even beyond the grave."

You've had some horrible things happen and have to find a way to work through them, and find out who you are without trying to be who others think you are. You might need to meet someone new, a friend, trust them, fall apart, scream, and then never see them again. I know it sounds weird, but you owe it to yourself to rebuild you, and you might have to burn a few bridges to get that done."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,c_megalodon,3,Mon Jul 20 04:11:29 2015 UTC,"There are 150+ comments in this thread with good advice & support so apologize if this has already been said. I don't want to repeat things that I hope are engraved in your heart by now (that you did nothing wrong & it wasn't your fault).  You're obviously hurt & disappointed that someone who are supposed to be close & caring did something terrible and there's nothing wrong with feeling whatever shred of fondness you still have for your father. However, I'd like to say that it's also alright for you to stop/discard whatever positive feeling for your abuser, if it's better for you. He didn't deserve your kindness and gentleness then and he doesn't deserve it now that he's gone even if he did have positive sides. My adopted father was a physically, verbally, and emotionally abusive man towards me & my mother. I took the abuse & didn't fight or talk back until I was in college. We are in a ""neutral"" relationship right now and I don't harbor hatred towards him as a person but I've found that not excusing, forgiving, or forgetting his abuse is better & healthier for me than the opposite, it doesn't make me less of a good/compassionate person. He was a bad father regardless of the money he spent to feed me & putting me through school. Your father was a bad father & a terrible person regardless of whatever actions he did that seemed kind. He obviously prioritized his urges than how you would feel about it and what kind of impact it'd do to your psyche. Those showed his lack of/skewed sympathy. Not everything is meant to be something to forgive or not forgive, you don't have the burden/obligation to forgive what he did at all. Certain things are wrong and will always be wrong. This might sound crass of me & I don't mean to imply that I'm glad your father died, but you (and your family) are better off without your abuser. You're better off without having to suffer in silence & fear while enduring an abuse.  I hope & I trust you will be able to ""discard"" him & the negative impact he did. Focus on taking care of yourself and those you love who also love you back. Stay in therapy and this is very important...if your therapist/their method doesn't work well/make you feel better, don't be afraid to look for a different therapist/method. I hope you will be able to find people you can trust who also trust you back, be in something that makes you happy whether it's a good relationship, job, school, etc. You're more than just an abuse victim and you have so many things to live & strife for. It's not impossible to achieve a sense of normalcy.  Shit, I end up repeating what others have said already anyway, oh well. Best of luck to you and if you ever want to talk/make a new friend with someone who are willing to see you beyond someone who is still dealing with abuse, feel free to hit me up (skype chat/snail mail, etc)."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,mmencius,2,Mon Jul 20 04:45:51 2015 UTC,"Sweetheart, I've never experienced anything like you have, but I can empathize at least a tiny little bit, because I have faced a lot of loneliness, for very different reasons (as a small child under 10 I was so socially non-functional my parents thought I might have autism which it turns out I did not, as a teenager I was really ugly due to the worst acne ever, and as an adult, I'm generally happy but adults living in a new city can still get lonely from time to time). And from your last sentence, you've got so much hanging over you, and what I think might be the saddest thing is > I can't handle any relationships with anyone, my family is dysfunctional, and I've felt more alone than I did before.  A lot of people are recommending counselling, therapy, and various numbers to call and they're absolutely right. I'll just add two small personal unscientific anecdotal recommendations. First, when you feel at your loneliest, know that you always have the planet earth, and nature. If you're not old enough to walk by yourself, ask someone who is willing just to watch over you and maybe even just stay silent to take you to a park or natural area where you can just be yourself, and for a second, relax the slightest bit out of your loneliness.  Second, you've clearly already experienced that it's so hard to talk to other teenagers about stuff like this. Don't blame your ex-boyfriend too much, he was just a child like you, and probably doesn't even understand consent. He's just too young to understand. But keep trying to find people. There will be one or two kids at school who will surprise you. They won't be mean or uncaring like other teenagers can be. They'll totally take care of you and receive all your sadnesses and insecurities and open their arms. Most kids will be horrible. But you will find core core amazing empathetic people, who will be your first stepping stone to building friendships and relationships with humanity all around you in general."

TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,Big_Jamal_AMA,2,Mon Jul 20 06:30:16 2015 UTC,"Darling you were mentally conditioned to feel guilt and shame when you didn't do what he wanted. It sounds to me like you are smart enough to know that that wasn't right. You cannot be held responsible for your fathers actions. You might go through A few stages of feeling different emotions. That's part of the healing process. The important thing to do now is not to worry about blame because none of it Is yours. From now on, you just focus on getting better and having the best future you can possibly have. You did nothing wrong, and if you were reading this story and somebody else wrote it, you could clearly see that just as we all can see it by reading your story."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,Antiochia,2,Mon Jul 20 06:52:53 2015 UTC,"""I took away her husband. I took away my brother's father."" - No you did not. HE did that. He is the one responsible for his actions against you, HE was as well the one that decided to be too much of a coward to face himself reality, HE was the one that did the actions against himself.  Giving the victim the responsibility for the abusers feelings, is a typical abuser behavior. As in ""See how I am forced to behave, because of your doing?"" Seek therapy. They are able too make you understand and see through it after some time."

TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,throwawaytrigger1121,2,Mon Jul 20 10:41:30 2015 UTC,"So obviously I made a throwaway for this, but I've been in an incredibly similar situation, it didn't end so tragically but it lasted between when I was 8 until I was 14.  I didn't get therapy until this year and I'm now 22. And it has helped, so much. Some uni's have clinics that are incredibly cheap for students (I pay $50 a week).   You may or may not still love your father, but whatever he did was never your fault, and that's what is important. You will be sad, you will be angry, you will be tired and guilty and and a whole bunch of other terrible feelings.  But you will survive, you might not be the same person, might never be, but eventually, maybe sooner, maybe later, you won't feel those things so much, they'll always be there, but they won't rule over your life, and eventually you'll feel like a person again.  It took me years to find happiness, of anykind, again.  But one day you'll get there. You just have to never give up."

TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,brazzy42,8,Mon Jul 20 17:50:04 2015 UTC,"First: you went through a horrible experience, but the worst of it is over, and now you can rebuild your life and put it behind you - not as if it never happened, but as in not letting it ruin the rest of your life. But it is very important to find someone to talk to, ideally counseling or therapy. Perhaps you and your mother can help each other pull through this if you can get over the instinct to avoid talking about the thing that pains you so.  Second: guilt. I don't think repeating the mantra ""it's not your fault."" is sufficient to answer that. There was an untenable situation your father created, which was extremely damaging to you and which gave you no other realistic option to protect yourself than what you did. Nobody (including yourself) should blame you for that.  Third: Read up on ""cognitive dissonance"". It's most likely part of what's messing you up because you can't reconcile the love you felt for your father with the way he hurt you and betrayed your trust. It's definitely a big part of what's messing up your mother, and it is the reason why some people in similar cases (hopefully not in yours) don't believe the victim - or pretend that nothing happened.  It's also why I think that heaping abuse on your father the way some comments here do is counterproductive. He was not an inhuman monster, despite the very bad things he did. He obviously had pedopliliac urges - you may also want to read up on that if you can bear it, TLDR: having them is not a choice, some people are born like that, suppressing them can be very hard. You father apparently lacked the strength of will to suppress them, or succumbed to the temptation to rationalize them. That makes him a (very) flawed human being, but not a monster. It doesn't mean that he had no positive side, it doesn't mean that the love he showed to your mother and to you wasn't real - and most importantly it doesn't mean that you're wrong if you still feel love for the man you knew before the abuse started, or sadness that he's gone.  People are complex, and not properly defined by some sort of ""wortiness sum"" you get by adding up their good and bad deeds."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,c_megalodon,10,Sun Jul 19 23:07:12 2015 UTC,"He obviously had pedopliliac urges - you may also want to read up on that if you can bear it, TLDR: having them is not a choice, some people are born like that, suppressing them can be very hard.   While it's true that having pedophiliac urges is not a choice, there are many people with sexual urges that are outside the 'norm' and would never take advantage or act upon their urges against an unwilling/non-consenting subject, regardless of whether they see their urges as something wrong or not. There are folks attracted to children or animals who understand what consent means & who take great care to never hurt a child/animal.  OP's father acting upon his urges made him a monster, regardless of whether or not he realized it was wrong. He offered neither apology nor resolve and prioritized his urges above the impact his actions did to his daughter --showing a great lack of sympathy/care for her psyche. He took advantage of OP & the rest of his family's trust. OP is not wrong for feeling hurt/confused by whatever she feels towards her father, but to me it doesn't matter one fucking bit that her father had positives sides. If he had stopped, apologized, tried to make things right, seek help, or directed his urges to a consenting person...it would've been a different story. He kept the abuse going, pretended nothing happened, etc and those made him a monstrous human being."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,Speak_in_Song,18,Mon Jul 20 04:01:50 2015 UTC,"I disagree. He may have had urges and gave in, but he knew it was wrong and sought no help. But the abuse wasn't just physical, he forced himself upon his daughter and manipulated her after she said, ""no.""   I know you're not saying it was okay and I agree with the recommendation of therapy/counseling. I agree with you in stating that there is greater complexity, but I disagree with you on him being a monster. He was a wolf in sheep's clothing. If he had truly rationalized it he should have been able to defend it, but he knew it was wrong. He knew it was indefensible. He knew he could not stand to have it public knowledge. He could have made a choice not to attack his daughter for years.   To me, a monster is a person who does monstrous things."

TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,riteilu,3,Mon Jul 20 10:42:03 2015 UTC,"This sounds so painful for you. I want to convey to you that you did the right thing, both in revealing what was happening to your counselor and in reaching out to a community when your family wasn't able to give you the support you need. None of this is your fault, not the abuse, not your father's suicide, not the disarray that you find your family in now.  I don't know if it would help, but this is how I would think of a situation like this: there was a demon that lived in your father. Maybe not a literal demon, and maybe it hadn't always been there, but nonetheless it lived in him. It hurt you first and longest, while casting an illusion over the rest of your family. When the illusion popped, it did so violently, hurting the rest of your family. You are not to blame for the hurt it caused, to you or to anyone else. You are not responsible for whatever twisted your father into hurting so many people. Nor are you wrong to wish you could have had your father without the demon.  For what it's worth, though - people who have gone through abuse typically do still go on to be healthy, functioning adults. It takes time and work, and it might be painful at times, but it can and does happen. The stats on how many people have been affected by abuse at some point in their life is actually quite frighteningly high - I want to say it's something like 1 in 4 people at least, distributed across all races, classes, genders. You are not alone.  Good luck. You can survive this."
TwoXChromosomes,3durwt,hoowatdittjuusey,3,Mon Jul 20 00:06:24 2015 UTC,"I always, always give this advice: know the bottom line. In this situation the bottom line is that what he did was WRONG. It was wrong. Everything else relates back to that. It felt wrong because it was. He killed himself because he was wrong. It messed you up (for now) because it was wrong. You did the right thing kiddo, stick to it and watch yourself. Go to therapy and when it gets to be too much to think about just remember the bottom line. Fuck that, what HE did was WRONG.

I pray that you can recover from this and truly be able to move on with your life because you deserve it. I know you do. I only hope that you believe that yourself, too.   Please know that you revealed the monster that your ""father"" truly was. You didn't deprive your mother or your brother or your family of your father. You saved them from all the lies that he was hiding behind all these years. They were living in comfort while you were suffering in pain. Your true father died a long time ago. Some how...some thought..... got inside your father's head past his duty and rules any father and any decent human being should follow. It just got past his common sense. He became this cowardly monster who would dare to take advantage of someone precious.   Do not worry about your family's loss. In time, they will accept your ""father's"" death and their blindness to the situation. Don't feel bad for them if you don't want to. Slowly take your time to process these emotions like guilt that you're having. It's going to be okay. It can only get better from here even though it doesn't seem like it. I don't blame you if you don't want to forgive your family, but I hope in time you will forgive yourself. Infact, I am sure we're proud of your strength. You are one tough girl believe it or not. Whatever moral compass you are following, keep following it. Don't even let go of it for the rest of your life. Let your heart, gut, and soul keep guiding you out of this ugly mess.  Know that your family was deprived of YOU when the monster was around. So I beg of you, please focus on you, no matter how insignificant they made you feel or even yourself. This will affect you for the rest of your life, but it doesn't have to haunt you.   I hope your brother will grow up and realize what happened and how thankful he will be to have a strong sister like you. I can only wonder what how he'll react when you tell him how you were thinking of him instead of suicide (if you choose to disclose this to him). Things have changed and it's going to be painful, but do your best. That's all that's required here.   Once again, I pray for you and your family.

You father, though you loved him deeply, was a disturbed man with, Im sure, many many demons that he was fighting within himself. Unfortunately you were his target and he would have done anything to get what he needed from you to elevate himself.   You should never feel guilty for what has happened. You in no way invited this treatment. You in no way caused the abuse you received. You in no way caused the pain that your mother is feeling. You are not responsible for your father's decision to take your innocence, and ruin your family.   You may not feel that you can talk to you anyone, that no one will listen. But there are many many people out there who are there to listen to you. You have many options. You have school guidence counselors, therapists, support groups for children like yourself. You have endless resources. It may take some time for you to move pass this, but you can move pass this, and achieve great things. You are beautiful inside and out. Don't let what he did, or how others treat you, define who you are and want to be. You were and still are capable of great things.

He did. He made all the choices to hurt you, to lie, to violate moral boundaries and to destroy your family. You were very brave to go to your counselor with this. I'm sorry for all you're enduring.   I know what it's like to mourn the good father while living with the bad one, and I know what it's like to have your family dynamic ruined by an abusive parent who blames you for their behavior.  My dad was, I thought, a kind, loving father when I was small. But then everything changed as I grew older, and he became horrible and abusive. It screwed with my head. I mourned my father -the man I thought I knew- for years. But I did recover. My life is good and I'm surrounded by loving people. I don't really have a father, but I no longer mourn him. I'm just glad I got out.   You will, I promise, recover. Your family won't be the same, and I can't assure you that it will normalize, but you can be okay. You're definitely not alone.   Oh, and as for your former boyfriend...he deserves a swift kick in the balls. That said, be aware that abused children tend to flock to abusive partners, re-living their dynamic until they can figure out how to ""fix"" it. So be careful who you date, when you start dating again.   Be safe and be well. You are going to be okay. Please talk to a counselor, ask your mom to do so as well. Y'all all need family therapy, I think, at some point, because this is a lot to deal with."

I don't have any feeling of lack in terms of parental connection. My parents were humans, just like any other, and you either get along and they impact your life positively or they don't, there is nothing special about them. I'm saying this to maybe help you realize that you don't need them. You never did. You can handle it. Learn, grow, achieve, on your own. Make your own family with people who treat you the way you know you deserve. Friends, mentors, etc. I don't know if this will help you.

But he was your father and good or bad you spent your life to this point with him in it. You're bound to grieve and even miss him on some level and you shouldn't feel guilty for that. You aren't crazy to have shreds of love for someone, even someone who abused you, especially when they occupied a central position in your life for such a long time. Be kind to yourself and try not to judge your own feelings. You are allowed to grieve his death at the same time you're grieving the damage he did. You're allowed to be angry too--people may try to say ""don't speak ill of the dead"" or something like that as a way of deflecting or devaluing your appropriate and healthy anger.

The thing I'm trying to tell you is - it's not your fault that your family got messed up. You may not feel it, but your father truly was an awful person. Nothing is your fault for what happened to you, and your boyfriend in the story reacted in a shitty way. He didn't understand your situation, but didn't try to at all.

Heckling them at close range and forcing them into a ""walk of shame"", making a deliberate and calculated effort to traumatise these women with gory images and the like, is where free speech crosses the line into personalised harassment and bullying.

Noone on my facebook feed is guilty of telling everyone their lovely daughter had an abortion yesterday or that Jimmy now has gonorrhea.   the way this will only be legal is if its a blanket ban on protests   No. It's a ban on protests that meet highly specific criteria: protests against abortion outside an abortion clinic. If there was a law against setting up a protest in someone's garden without their permission would that be ""a blanket ban on protests?""   you cant limit someones free speech unless in the most extreme of cases   Yes you can, and it has been done. Eg. hate speech, defamation, copyright. Many feminists would argue that abortion protest is hate speech against women, because it's so tied up in attitudes towards female sexuality.  Also, because ""free speech"" is not a valid or logical reason without further evidence as to how this particular form of ""free speech"" is not causing direct harm and suffering. The law is about preventing bullying and harassment of individuals, not silencing abortion protesters.  Black people, Jews and other racial and religious minorities are protected from hurtful racist forms of protest and bullying by hate speech laws. We need a law to protect women from sexist female sexuality-hating (let's face it - that's what it all boils down to) protest - even if only when it's directly aimed at individual women (kicking them when they're down)."

Yes you can, and it has been done. Eg. hate speech, defamation, copyright.    copyright is theft and its not against the speech its about taking something from someone illegally or passing something that isnt yours off as yours, defamation isnt illegal its a civil matter that you can be sued for but you cant be arrested for it. hate speech is one of the extreme cases, and not all anti abortion protests are about female sexuality but sometimes maybe about the view on when a life is considered alive.   Noone on my facebook feed is guilty of telling everyone their lovely daughter had an abortion yesterday or that Jimmy now has gonorrhea.   /r/relationships is full of stories of people either being maliciously outed or accidentally outed for having abortions or STI's. things like boyfriends telling sisters about their girlfriends getting abortions and looking for advice, mothers mentioning abortions at family gatherings and how they are upset it happened, friends telling other friends that jimmy or annie have the Clap. these are all invasions of privacy but you have no expecation of privacy with those people or situations and its not illegal for them to tell anyone. now if it was your doctor that told people, then it would be something you could sue them for.  edit: kept on updating my post as i came up with more arguments for each point. nothing has been removed or changed, just added onto."

Free speech is vitally important, but in an intelligent functional society it should be possible to agree to certain limitations on free speech for specific cases where it may cause damage to an individual unjustly and/or for no greater good, or where it further marginalises an already oppressed demographic.

Taking my definition of ""good"" as used in a protest context, what ""good"" does harassing an individual going about his or her private life do? Does it change their opinion? NO. Does it make them hate you (and potentially hate what you're trying to say even more)? YES. Does it influence other peoples' opinions or raise awareness? No or hardly at all. It does very little good at all, all it does do give the protester a fleeting feeling of satisfaction whilst harming the person who was subjected to their protest.  Protesting to a prominent figure about a broader issue that he or she controls is not the same as bullying that person in their private life about personal matters. Abortion protesters are protesting individual abortions one by one as women arrive at the clinic, they are not attempting to change policy or raise societal awareness...

Might be hard to legislate against, but that doesn't make it OK and nor does it justify letting abortion protesters harass people.   how the protest is being handled that makes it harassment   No, because they are protesting something very private and personal, directly against people who may be in an extremely vulnerable state and more affected by even mild harassment.   Standing outside a medical facility with a sign that shows you are closely observing the movements of individuals entering and leaving that facility, making judgemental assumptions about those individuals life choices and speculating on what gynacaelogical procedure they are there for is intrusive, creepy and potentially traumatising.  The problem of women seeking abortion being traumatised and harassed outside of abortion clinics can be solved by seeing it as personalised harassment in a way that other forms of protest are not.   yes the problem it solved was people stealing the ideas and intellectual ideas   No, Copyright only protects tangible works. Ideas and concepts can not be copyrighted and they cannot be considered ""stolen"" by law. Copyright law does impinge on free speech somewhat - there are limitations on how you can lawfully represent an idea in the same creative representation as was made by someone else (eg republishing an opinion piece on your blog without permission) and in many cases representation of an idea is pivotal to its communication. So you might wish to communicate an opinion in a book that you're writing but you can't manage to convey it in your own words - but if copyright didn't exist you could just copy the article that sums up your thoughts into your book."

Is that not also bullying and harassment? I think you'd agree that it is... yet if a law were passed which banned protesting on a university campus there would be an uproar.   (exhaustively cited video of the feminist protest of Warren Farrell at the University of Toronto in 2012)  Ultimately, there will always be someone who feels ""bullied"" or ""harassed"" by protesters and they want it banned... but there's always a double standard. As soon as they want their voice heard, suddenly their cause is righteous and they deserve the right to protest. It's always fair, always just cause, when it's your cause.   We can't pick and choose what people are allowed to protest over, or where they're allowed to protest (so long as it's public property)... it's a gross infringement of our civil rights and liberties. Where do we draw the line? Everyone's answer is always the same: we draw the line at my beliefs."

If they can still protest within reasonable distance of the clinic, then that's less of an issue.  I'm not crazy about the photography ban either, TBH.  There's no reasonable expectation of privacy on a public street.  Anyone who posts photographs of women entering an abortion clinic to publicly shame them is a reprehensible scumbag, but you can't make it illegal to take photographs in a public setting.

You can be sued for it, but no one is going to jail for it.

I'm not sure that's necessarily true. You can protest things in a lot of ways-- flyers, verbally, pickets in other places (like a public downtown area, or just a few blocks away). Obviously it would be bad if it were extended to, say, a government building, and people just had to 'protest elsewhere'. That wouldn't be fair and would be counter to free speech, definitely.  BUT-- here we have two competing issues, free speech and other peoples' freedom from harassment and medical anonymity. I think having to move a couple blocks away (that's still pretty visible and no one would have any doubt what you're protesting) is a nice compromise between not stifling free speech and allowing people to continue to go harassed. A government building on the other hand is necessarily public in many ways, and it would not be appropriate to limit people to a distance away."

It didn't matter if they were there for an abortion or for a basic exam, or just to talk to the doctor about a private medical matter.   So yeah. Let them protest but keep them away from the entrance and parking area of the clinics. I'm 100% in favor of that.   EDIT: I wasn't aware laws had been enacted to prevent protest on the grounds of the clinic. It wasn't that way back then, but I guess there has been some advancement in how we deal with these jerks. Still, the parking areas of a strip mall (where some clinics are) might be considered public property in some places, so I'd still like to see some control over how much the protesters can interact with other citizens just trying to get into a clinic."

TwoXChromosomes,3dw220,RampagingKittens,20,Mon Jul 20 04:17:41 2015 UTC,"Then they should technically not need a new law to cover this. What you're essentially saying is that the legal framework to deal with this problem already exists and no one is doing anything about the harassment. People SHOULD be allowed to peacefully protest and the protesters who get up in other peoples' faces can, and should be, dealt with using the current laws. I think it's sloppy (both legally and politically) to isolate one group.  Now, laws do vary from place to place so it could very well be that Australia has abysmal policies on dealing with harassment, I don't know. It could very well be that this law is necessary because police officers in Australia don't have the legal backing to arrest people for harassment (but I doubt it).  Plus, at least in Canada, a law like this teeters on violating some items in our charter since the charter allows for peaceful assembly and freedom of the press. Since we can't guarantee that all protests are always non-peaceful, a law like this just wouldn't work. I think your idea of harassment and the legal definition of harassment are two different things. Yelling, photos, etc. are not considered harassment.   Bottom line, I do not believe having an easier abortion trumps fundamental rights and freedoms. Abortion is just not that sacred. It's hard, but so are a lot of other things in this world. Abortion is far from the worst thing that could happen to a person and I'm so puzzled why some find it necessary to treat these people like delicate little flowers when, as I said, lots of bad things happen. Abortion does not deserve to be singled out."

If they are too timid to assert their rights, they are denying themselves their own rights. We don't pass laws restricting other people in order to ""even things out.""  Or why are we not protesting in retribution at churches? Every Sunday morning we should be lined up at the church entrances with provocative photos showing all the young children all the things they are missing out on by going to church. Or perhaps signs that say ""Forcing children to attend church is child abuse?"" ""Are you forced to attend church against your will?

If people start protesting gun laws in America, saying they need too be stricter, are they just going too ban protesting about it? Just because the law says they have a right too guns?

There is no slippery slope or chilling effect -they're not being put in jail for their beliefs, their ideas are not being suppressed.   A balance can be found.  I understand full well the arguments for protesters, it's time to return to amor se an approach that respects the rights of workers and those seeking medical attention.  Frankly I believe if you want to do an extended protest, you have to have a permit.   If you want to protest the government long term, no permit needed.   If you are protesting your own employer long term, no permit needed.  If you want to harass people who are going to work or going to the doctor and you're going to do it everyday I'm sorry at some point it's no longer acceptable.

People who protest guns don't go picketing outside gun stores, photographing the rednecks who are buying 44 magnums and splashing their pix on Facebook, calling them ""gun nuts"" and giving out their license plate numbers and home addresses. They aren't calling gun buyers names and trying to shame them into not making a purchase. Instead, people who protest gun laws go to Congress or the state legislature and protest--to the lawmakers who can actually change the law.   Abortion protesters, on the other hand, are all about shaming individual behavior at their protests. And that is disgusting to me.

I also would feel more comfortable if I had a spare pack around just in case. So far it's never happened, but say I lost a pack (knock on wood that I've not just jinxed it!), or I suddenly needed to skip, or my local pharmacy shut down and my prescription wasn't transferred to another pharmacy, or... I wold just feel more secure being able to be more in control of my medication.

When you leave your house, you encounter a very narrow piece of the world. Even then, you don't know who (or what) you are actually encountering. The well-dressed, mild-mannered business man on the train could be an MRA mod. You don't know until you take the plunge and get online where these elements can't be avoided.

You can't just ignore the parts of reddit that are anti feminist and then say ""reddit is a feminist utopia, as long as you're ignoring all the anti feminist parts!"""
TwoXChromosomes,3dy392,MissRepresentation,17,Mon Jul 20 22:09:43 2015 UTC,"TRP is not a default. TwoX, however, is. I think that Reddit can be whatever a person makes of it. My experience of Reddit can be an atheist haven, as long as I don't go to /r/Christianity. It can be a hilarious place, if I go to /r/explainlikeIAmA and avoid /r/funny. If somebody thinks that Reddit as a statement is anti-feminist, they are going to the wrong places. Reddit is not a hive-mind, it is a collection of many people who think very differently. It's unfortunate that the people who are loudest and most offensive garner the most attention."
TwoXChromosomes,3dy392,Qu1nlan,12,Mon Jul 20 14:09:36 2015 UTC,"Reddit is much more of a hive mind than most other websites because of the voting system. The ""loud minority"" doesn't apply here because comments and posts are supported by votes. When thousands of upvotes go to posts that are anti feminist or even downright sexist, racist, or homophobic, the idea that reddit is a ""feminist utopia"" is laughable at best and downright embarrassing to say out loud at worst."
TwoXChromosomes,3dy392,MissRepresentation,4,Mon Jul 20 16:11:51 2015 UTC,"The voting system only works for people who see those comments and submissions. Something awful in TRP that gets 300 upvotes gets those because it's appreciated by those who visit TRP - if every single person on Reddit were voting on it, I'd venture to say it would get a negative score. There are of course vote-brigading issues that can skew this issue, but those are relatively rare and tend to only happen to a few communities."
TwoXChromosomes,3dy392,Qu1nlan,4,Mon Jul 20 16:17:18 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the default subs aren't much better. It's not at all uncommon to find threads that are absolutely full of sexist or racist comments with hundreds, if not thousands, of upvotes. Just a week or so ago there was a post on /r/videos which did nothing else but shit on women and talk about how they're catty and bad at their jobs.  Sorry, but anyone who thinks that reddit is a feminist utopia is being willfully ignorant."
TwoXChromosomes,3dy392,MissRepresentation,2,Mon Jul 20 16:35:18 2015 UTC,"Yet again - this subreddit, /r/TwoXChromosomes, is a default.

With that price I'm assuming a transvaginal aspiration with ultrasound. If the ER took her and did it laparoscopically, we're back in the familiar US surgery costs of tens of thousands.  Some avenues for you to try:  1) Another hospital  2) Free or reduced cost / sliding scale hospitals (often long waits, more prevalent in larger metros)  3) Free or reduced cost / sliding scale clinics for a second opinion  4) United Way (often calling 211 in many areas) to find places for referrals  5) Planned Parenthood may be able to assist  If $400 will buy the surgery and increase her quality of life and increase her future reproductive odds, I'd say find a way to finance it. Many places will work out payment plans. Best of luck to your friend and cheers to you for helping her out."

Depending on her income she may even wish to quit her job so that she'll qualify for medicaid.   If she makes too much to qualify for medicaid, then she should try to save up for the surgery. 600 isn't so much compared to the real cost. I assume that's her copay. The hospital may let her do a payment plan. Maybe she can even borrow it on /r/borrow or get a credit card to pay for it. But this is important medical care for her to get."

An ultrasound can confirm the placement of the Mirena, so I don't know why they are saying she needs an MRI. Yes, she needs it surgically removed. It can get infected and be really bad if she doesn't.  Surgical removal is fairly simple, but $400 is a low estimate for surgery. Has she looked into applying for Medicaid coverage? That's the best suggestion I have, to try qualify for Medicaid and then get the care she needs."

This is a major betrayal of trust. Honestly, I don't think you should continue your relationship.   Don't worry about anyone seeing them. You should not feel ashamed for being naked under your clothes and for sharing this with your committed partner. If you know who the photos were shared with, explain the situation and ask them to delete them. Any decent human being will do so, but unfortunately there are no guarantees.   I once read about a guy who masturbated on webcam with a hot woman. The woman recorded the video and then tried to blackmail him with the threat of sending it to his friends and family. Instead, the guy just posted on Facebook about what happened: ""If you get sent a naked video of me, this is why. Sorry!"". Perhaps this is not the thing for you to do in this situation, but do recognise that you are not to be put to shame or have this held over you. You are a victim of a cruel action and should not feel guilty."

If her (ex-?)boyfriend just shared them with his friends, I wouldn't really want anyone he didn't show about their existance.   But I'd certainly tell your close friends you think he might share them with. And anyone else else that mentions it just shrug it off ""wow, who'd have thunk I had skin under these clothes, huh?"" or something. If you don't react, he's likely to stop.     As for OP's future with the guy: he's already proven that he doesn't respect you. I don't see this going anywhere positive. It's pretty hard to bounce back from that."

Maybe I am just paranoid, but most of your relationships are going to end.  50% chance even your marriage will end.  Thus I have always felt it is quite risky to have any pictures out there.  It does suck that it happened to you.  People your age will understand and not judge you for it (too much, though a few harsh comments may come from those you don't get along with), but older people and employers are another story.  If you can get all the copies deleted before they are uploaded to a website, this can still be beaten.  If not, its whack a mole for a few years of at least making sure your name is not attached to the pictures.  Bit of advice:  if one feels like they must give in and send pictures to your SO - keep your face, any easily identifyable birth marks, furniture, clothes, tatoos, ect out of the picture.  Plausible deniability will then exist with those you know well and 99.99999% of people will have no way of knowing who it was."

After being with him for years, I  stayed another 4 months until I realised I could never, ever trust him again, and I loved him still but he had ruined it. There's no point in a relationship where you literally cannot trust the person.   If you're thinking of leaving him, listen to that voice.

Although it's going to be hard, because your Ex might just think you were trying to be rapey. You're in a tough spot. Honestly..I think the best thing to do is to talk to your daughter about it, let her know that there are limits that need to be respected. Namely that intimate relationships between father and daughter aren't something that you approve of. I'd just proceed carefully and with caution."
TwoXChromosomes,3dxiiq,MechaFlamingoCandy,34,Mon Jul 20 16:52:43 2015 UTC,"Yiiiikes. that's bad.   I don't know what the best thing to do is but essentially you have to be careful and direct. Your daughter is pretty young still, still old enough to know better, but maybe doesn't really get it. Incest is a legitimate sexual fantasy to have but you obviously need to tell her that it is not okay to touch someone sexually while they are sleeping, and that there are many reasons why it cannot and should not happen between you two (reason number 1 being you don't want it, reason number 2 being she is underaged and it's illegal and you could go to jail, etc). She maybe does not appreciate the full weight of what she is doing.  I don't know if you should tell your wife or not about what happened. On the other hand, I can imagine it going badly wrong, but I feel like maybe your daughter could benefit from therapy because she should be old enough to know those sorts of boundaries, and if she doesn't... that's concerning. It makes me wonder if everything's ok or if she has any other issues. It's not like I think having an incest fantasy makes you messed up, but rather the fact that she actually touched you against your will and is actually trying to get it to be acted out. It could just be she really wants it badly (and if she's that upset about it maybe her fetish is to the point of being unhealthy), but it could also be her acting out because of some other reason.  In any case you have to make sure you communicate clearly, as awful and uncomfortable as it is (I'd argue that compared to being groped by your daughter this is the less awkward part, but I know in practice actually speaking about it is worse). Not only that, but you have to take active steps to make sure it never happens again. If your bedroom door has a lock, use it. If you don't have one, and she must sleep over, get a lock. If she doesn't have to stay over and you don't have a lock, then don't allow her to stay over for a while until you have communicated clearly about this and you are sure she will stop being inappropriate with you.   In short, she is in need of some sex education about setting boundaries, being safe, and respecting consent. She doesn't need to be shamed for her fantasy but she needs to learn how to have sex safely in the future (i.e. finding safer outlets for her fantasy that doesn't put her at risk ).  Your daughter may have cried but it could have been for a number of reasons: frustrations, feeling rejected (?), or just embarrassed and deflecting the blame by crying. It doesn't make you a bad father, you have to set your foot down. Your ex can think whatever she wants to think, but just tell her she was doing something inappropriate. You could even say something like you caught her downloading porn on your computer or something, but I don't know if your ex needs the details. But I'm sure that part will blow over. But you still have to talk to your daughter and it seems like it is incumbent on you as a parent to help teach your daughter about sexual appropriateness and safety."
TwoXChromosomes,3dxiiq,zhongshiifu,2,Mon Jul 20 10:53:43 2015 UTC,"The only thing I will add, is that age has little to do with maturity, and there is no such thing as someone who is ""too old"" for therapy.  I know you didn't say that, but it seemed implied based on this;   ""I feel like maybe your daughter could benefit from therapy because she should be old enough to know those sorts of boundaries, and if she doesn't... that's concerning. """
TwoXChromosomes,3dxiiq,CondorCalabasas,0,Tue Jul 21 08:00:56 2015 UTC,"Ah, my comment has nothing to do with her age meaning she's too old for therapy, but rather the opposite, admittedly not clearly worded-- that the fact that she has these issues at an age as old as 15 indicates greater need for therapy. I would expect a 5 year old to not understand sexual appropriateness. I would expect a 15 year old to already understand it."
TwoXChromosomes,3dxiiq,zhongshiifu,11,Tue Jul 21 08:14:23 2015 UTC,"This is a sticky situation, and I would be really careful on how you proceed from here. Ideally, you would have had a conversation when you first noticed the porn (yeah, it's awkward, but sex ed is also a part of raising a child, and you would have had a clear starting point for the conversations) or when she started barging into the bathroom etc. Alas, you can't go back in time and change your initial response, so the question is: where do we go from here?  I have to ask: do you suspect that there could be anybody in your daughter's life taking advantage of her? If her sexual norms are faded like this, that could be a pointer to abuse.  At the very least, a good conversation is warranted, where you make sure you're condemning the actions, but not your daughter. For such a conversation, I highly recommend that you speak separately with your ex first, and keep it factual (like: don't question her parenting!). Forget any former relationship baggage you may have, and be parents together, because your girl will need you two to be a united front on this.  Definitely don't try to sweep what has happened under the rug: if you pretend like nothing happened, you very well run the risk of being accused of inappropriate behaviour towards your child. After all: why would you cover this up if your did nothing wrong? I'd advise to have a counselor present, maybe already for the talk with your ex, but even more so for the conversation with your ex and your daughter, because I think everybody could benefit from the help of a professional, and it could help prevent things being pulled out of context and getting charges filed against you. It's nasty that you have to protect yourself from such accusations, and it's actually super rare that girls & women bring out fake accusations, but if you're not on the best terms with your ex, having a mother file charges even while the daughter maintains nothing wrong happened could also severely damage you. Don't cover anything up, because that could raise undue suspicions.  As for your relationship with your daughter, that probably will be strained a while, but try to keep communicating that you care a lot for her, that you love her, but that some thing just aren't appropriate. Extensive sexual education is definitely called for, she needs to learn about things like consent (even if she were not your daughter, groping somebody without their consent isn't healthy!), healthy relationships, etc.  Good luck! I hope you guys can settle this in a healthy manner."
TwoXChromosomes,3dxiiq,LiddedPotArena,11,Mon Jul 20 12:51:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not a psychologist but I am a teenage girl whose parents divorced years ago, so I'm trying to kind of put myself in your daughter's place here because I doubt it's very nice for her either. What she did was definitely wrong but I'd confront the sexual assault aspect of it rather than the incest - it's what is more relevant outside of this one situation and what deserves to be shamed due to its being a conscious act, as opposed to her admittedly unfortunate sexual desires. I don't really know how to advise on the assault thing and everybody's giving you tips on it anyway, but I'd quite like to try and sort out the other part of the issue, which is that she wants you to be attracted to her in a decidedly not-paternal way.  First of all, I'm assuming you've heard of the Oedipus/Elektra complex(es); basically, there is a school of thought that all children are to a degree attracted to their parents, more usually manifested as attraction towards non-relatives who are similar to their parents. Not sure how much I agree with that, but I do think that the parent-child relationship is of a similar intensity to lovers' relationships, and especially in situations where the parent is removed or distanced (e.g. divorce and living in separate homes) wires can get crossed. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that maybe this started because she wanted more attention from you - I know sometimes I catch myself trying really, really hard to be super intellectual and witty around my dad because I don't always see him very often and when I do I want him to admire and be proud of me. And then maybe she defaulted to what's probably worked for her when she wants attention from other males: sex. You even found it ""cute"" at first, so perhaps she picked up on this and thought that meant she should take it further (none of this is meant to blame you, by the way; she is the one who misinterpreted everything, but she's young and perhaps hasn't had the best relationships with males so far, especially if she's not got any brothers - try to take this as an opportunity to teach her that males and females can have all kinds of different relationships that don't need to be based on sex).  Basically, I'd sit her down and explain that no matter what the circumstance, consent must always be given in any sexual situation and you definitely do not give your consent, but you love her very much as a father and want her to be happy. Try to be as non-judgemental as possible. She will probably be mortified, I don't know if there's anything you can do about that. Maybe even just leave it at that if she doesn't seem inclined to talk about it any more, or maybe get more into discussion. Depends on you.  Perhaps try to get any uncles/brothers/grandfathers involved in her life to be more so, in a very very nonsexualised way? This could go wrong, though. So much of this depends on very personal and individual factors. Still, I hope this helps you in some way!  Good luck to you both :)"
TwoXChromosomes,3dxiiq,insinceregiraffe,16,Mon Jul 20 13:51:02 2015 UTC,"I say get out ahead of this and tell your ex, if only to protect yourself incase daughter decides to say something later about you touching her.  99.99% chance of that never happen, but the little bit that's left is worth doing it for.

If you have any kind of a decent relationship, this is when it's important to co-parent. Alternatively, talk to your daughter, tell her that mom needs to know about this and decide together what to tell her. And then you and the ex should decide what to do together. It's tough. And if she went back to moms that night and neither of you are telling her what happened, she already knows something happened."
TwoXChromosomes,3dxiiq,oheythatgirl,3,Tue Jul 21 00:42:20 2015 UTC,"If this is actually a true and honest post... (I'm a woman, age 23)  1) Tell your ex (her mother) both of you need to be on the same page about this.  2) My dad died when I was 7, so (even though I feel like I would never experiment with possible feelings like this) I never had the chance to even consider it myself.  But I mean... raging hormones are raging hormones and this could be a phase that she is taking too far, or this is honestly what she is into and shes exploring it even though that's not cool for you and generally not cool on a social, genetic, mental level etc. Mentally there might be something else that she is craving which is translating to a ""dad"" complex.  3) You need to talk to her about why she can't just pop into your (or anyone else's) room and touch you (or anyone else). You need to talk to her about what she's feeling, that you understand at her age things are confusing/intriguing but why it's not necessarily right in this context.  4) You should consider suggesting therapy for her because there is something complex going on with her mentally that's probably deep rooted, and she probably has no idea what it is, which is what therapy is for. Therapy often has a negative stigma attached to it but I feel everyone, with or without inherent problems, benefit from talking to someone in a safe environment, who is there just for you, and you know is a professional.  5) You might benefit from some therapy from this whole ordeal as well. But he or she has to be a therapist who is completely separate from your daughter's."
TwoXChromosomes,3dxiiq,Gavin_DeGreer,4,Mon Jul 20 16:24:10 2015 UTC,"I would suggest you take a look at any other males in her life. Her exploration and inappropriate touching sound like they could be cries for help. I am not saying she has to have been abused, but hyper-sexuality can be a result of abuse or molestation. No matter what, it sounds like therapy would be a good idea for her, even more so if it gives her a safe place to open up about anything that may have happened to her. Also, side note: incest porn on its own isn't necessarily a bad thing. I have read a lot of women have taboo fantasies (rape, incest, etc). However the acting out on it is what is so concerning."
TwoXChromosomes,3dxiiq,cleaver_username,2,Mon Jul 20 19:34:48 2015 UTC,"As your handle says ""weird"" and hard to believe no matter how stunningly gorgeous you are.    I would take the key back and start setting strict boundaries.  No kid ""you don't get to grope others and others don't get to grope you without permission"".  Yelling ""what the hell are you doing?""  when someone unexpectedly grabs your genitals while you're asleep is pretty mild.  Tell her you love her as a daughter and want to do all the father daughter things with her that make her happy but she is never ever to do that again.  And since this is such a peculiar thing you might want her to see a therapist for teens."
TwoXChromosomes,3dxiiq,DConstructed,5,Mon Jul 20 22:34:43 2015 UTC,"Your daughter is acting like a sexual predator. Im sorry this happened to you. I recommend you seek a therapist, and I highly recommend you do not have her in your home while you are sleeping in the future. She clearly has no boundaries. Be careful, because its highyl possible she could do you harm with lies. I would not be around her alone in the future until this is squashed. TELL YOUR EX. She has to know."
TwoXChromosomes,3dxiiq,Banevader69,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:05:20 2015 UTC,"Oh my.    Well, first of all I think it is absolutely imperative that you sit down and talk to her about this.  Tell her it was inappropriate and explain to her why.  With her being 15, she should already know ""why"" but maybe you need to reiterate it to her.  Make sure you bring up the internet searches that you found as well.  Then, you need to lay out a set of ground rules so it doesn't happen again.  This is a dangerous situation and unless you are tactful about it, it could backfire on you and make your life hell.  It sounds like she has some serious issues to work out.  See if you can get her in counseling of some sort because this is NOT normal behavior, even for a sexually curious 15 year old girl.  She will be embarrassed, she may even get angry.  Stand your ground."
TwoXChromosomes,3dxiiq,doodlebop12486,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:04:40 2015 UTC,"I want to seriously, seriously recommend you go and talk to a family therapist. Preferably one who deals with ""troubled"" /at risk teens. This behaviour isn't normal and I think your daughter needs help. You also need to create a support system both for her and yourself before either one of you get into serious trouble. I don't know if you should talk to your ex before meeting with a therapist, as I don't know tour relationship. Will she believe you?"
TwoXChromosomes,3dxiiq,L_E_G,3,Mon Jul 20 21:21:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I'd be concerned that your daughter's inappropriate behaviour might be related to previous inappropriate sexual contact initiated by someone in a position of power over her (a ""father figure"", so to speak). Whether that's the case or not, it can only harm her - or you or both - and she needs professional help.  I really feel for you. What an impossible situation. My feeling, though is that if your relationship with your ex is in any way amicable you need to let her know about what's happening. What if your daughter is behaving in a similar way with a stepfather or other older male figure in her life who might not have her best interests at heart?"
TwoXChromosomes,3dxiiq,Babbit_B,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:41:53 2015 UTC,It is very unusual for a teenage girl to have any interest in her biological father. I would wonder if she has been raped or sexually abused before.
TwoXChromosomes,3dxiiq,OneRedSent,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:53:12 2015 UTC,Her mom needs to know what is going on. You need to have a talk with your daughter about consent and sexual assault and boundaries. Possibly consider some therapy.   Is there a step dad at her mom's place? Her behavior is so far away from normal I wonder if she is/has been abused.
TwoXChromosomes,3dxiiq,fluorowhore,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:16:34 2015 UTC,"Hi, OP here ( stupidly did not wrote my password down and did not provide email because I do not want my personal info exposed so I am writing it on this account). First of all I wanna thank you for your responses and advices. I will try to give answers to questions asked and give a little more info about situation. I know some of you here wrote to tell my ex about this situation, but I do not think this is the smartest move before consulting with lawyer or this can pretty much change my life to extreme and I have to be really carefull how I approach this. I am planing to have a talk with my daughter tonight and explain some things. I do think she is little naive well because porn can skew perception of reallity. The thing is I do have really close relationship with my daugther because I did not want her to miss father figure in life as I saw what this can do to kids. When I wrote that I find it cute at first, it was just funny to se my daughter is growing up ( clumsiness was funny too) and she is entering new period of her life, thats all, no sexual context in here whatsoever. You can say anything you want about our relationship, except that I am not there for her. She can ask me for advice anytime ( and she does that) and of course if I can give her my perspective on some things, I do that. We talk very often and she is the one of rare things I find to be positive in my life ( and really mean that). So, I really do not think there is problem with giving her no attention because that  is one thing I try to avoid. I do not mention my sexual partners to her and try to avoid to bring them at my home when she is there. I tease her and try to bring positive emotions in her life because I wanna see her get trough that period of her life with as little pain as possible. We are just like buddies, but I am also authority. That is why this incident has come as shock to me. She does not have to fight for my attention and to me this is one of those surreal experience in life you can go trough. I never read happen this to anyone unless it was some cheesy porn way. I do not think she is or was ever abused and I mainly see this as teenage hormones and her being immature ( which is normal for her age). This fetish ( if that is the problem ) is just too foreign  to me because I could never see my sisters in that way even them being attractive. First, I will have conversation with her and try to take it from there. At first I freaked out a little, but now when emotions subsided I will try to approach this in way it those as little damage as possible for both of us."
TwoXChromosomes,3dxiiq,Weird1801,-2,Tue Jul 21 09:31:53 2015 UTC,"What country are you in/what's the minimum age for sexual activity where you are?  In most places incest is banned, but if she's not old enough to do anything sexually then it makes the situation a lot worse. Either way, you need to explain how wrong it is, but even more so if she's under age."
TwoXChromosomes,3dxiiq,coriacea,-6,Mon Jul 20 16:22:38 2015 UTC,"What bugs me is that initially you thought it was ""cute?""  I don't care for you to elaborate on that.  This I will say your daughter needs help and you need to involve your ex.  Tell her everything contact a family therapist and ask her what she recommends.  This is way beyond reddit and your daughter needs help.  For now limit your contact and have someone there with you so you are never alone with her.  This is a very slippery slope of which what she says can land you in jail.  Your computer has a history of child pornography now.  I would think about your relationship with your ex.  Was she bitter about your seperation? Are you on good terms?"

Whether the girl shares his genes or not, she is his daughter. Even if she weren't his daughter, this kind of behavior is not ok."

TwoXChromosomes,3dxiiq,honglath,7,Mon Jul 20 12:17:34 2015 UTC,"You already lost your wife because neither of you knew what the other was thinking, do you really want to lose your daughter as well due to bad communication skills?   Another commenter already pointed out one uncalled for statement so I'll grab this one. What the fuck is this? You do realize there are tons of reasons why divorce happens including falling out of love and simply just not desiring to stay married anymore, right? Why don't you stick to lurking for a bit longer and maybe read a book or something on socially acceptable behaviors and comments, because that seems to fly right over your head."
