You rarely get long-distance / panoramic shots of lions on Television. Because you'd see the ring of tourist vans 200 ft out.   Lions who behave aggressively in this context get removed.   Nat Geo had this big production where they filmed them at night - the only time they were free of constant human intervention.   SO ""hunting"" a well known lion is NOT hunting. Its target practice.

The lions there during the day were so accustomed to humans, they literally didnt even bother to get up and look at us if they were in the middle of napping. ""Hunted"" with a bow and arrow? A person could have walked up to one and put it in a choke hold - not advocating that approach, Im sure it would end badly - my point being is that they have no reason really to fear humans, as they see people every day. Killing one of these majestic (if not a bit lazy during the day) animals and calling it ""hunting"" is disgusting. THIS is why we cant have nice things. Because we just kill or destroy it.

environment,3e1u7a,kisses_joy,3,Tue Jul 21 12:53:12 2015 UTC,This is straight up poaching. Hunting (as in through proper legit channels) has more of a positive conservational impact
environment,3e1u7a,PassionateFlatulence,-6,Tue Jul 21 13:05:47 2015 UTC,No it doesn't.
environment,3e1u7a,kisses_joy,2,Tue Jul 21 13:26:29 2015 UTC,"Yes it does. Hunters are responsible for the vast majority of conservation money and efforts.  There are actually many places in Africa where many animals have rebounded in numbers solely because of hunter revenue.    Is it sad? Yes. Should animals in places like Africa need to be monetized in order to get serious attention? No. But, until people stop pissing and moaning about things they are doing nothing about and actually work towards a solution it will continue to be hunters who are funding their recovery.    Also, as in the case with the Rhino that was auctioned off last year, the alpha male was no longer breeding but was still preventing other males from mating. So, they auctioned off the hunt for a ton of money and got to help the Rhinos and fund further conservation efforts.   Hunters are also responsible for the majority of conservation money in North America as well. Just because they kill/harvest these animals doesn't mean they don't also care about them.    I hunt for meat to provide myself and my family with the healthiest meat available.  I also believe it to be the most humane for the animals since factory farming is mostly unnatural and gross. In Canada (I can't speak for the US but I believe it's the same) it's illegal to waste meat. I disagree with hunting strictly for sports sake. However, there are those who hunt and donate the meat to the homeless or less fortunate.    Sorry for the rant. Intent was to be informative.    tl;dr - Hunters are not bad people. However, there will always be a few pricks in any group and poaching a lion for no cause is still a dick move."

You can just as easily say that driving is important to conservation because some driver tags pay for conservation programs. So it's only ""an important part"" because of various laws. At core, though, hunting, which involves taking out alpha males, has a net negative on conservation. Similarly, if you look at the ""legit channels"" in much of Africa, well, it ain't good for species at all. Take wolves in Idaho. Those ""legit channels"" will see to their decimation in short order."

You really don't know what you're talking about, least of all that not all populations have the same hierarchy.   Trophy hunting helps conservation because stupid selfish people pay huge sums of money to kill old non breeding males that jeopardize the population. There are other situations (that I don't agree with) that help conservation too, like paying to help cull elephant herds. So instead of paying a wildlife manager to kill the ""problem"" individuals, narcissists dump huge amount of money for the opportunity  (that is arranged by the guides who stage it and do the tracking,  etc) to ""hunt"" an individual that was already picked out for them."
environment,3e1u7a,opalorchid,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:42:08 2015 UTC,"So you think that all or most hunting of trophy animals is killing the old, tired males who no longer breed and ""jeopardize"" the population by their mere existence?"
environment,3e1u7a,kisses_joy,5,Tue Jul 21 15:50:00 2015 UTC,"You clearly have a reading deficiency.  I did not say tired. I said old non breeding males who are agressive and try to kill the healthy, younger, breeding males. In a k value population where breeding is critical to keep numbers stable if not increasing, you need to make sure every breeding individual can have the opportunity to mate. By allowing a non breeding male to kill off potential breeders, you jeopardize the population.  Lazy old males don't jeopardize a population by merely existing,agressive old males jeopardize it by killing those who are able to contribute.    You just seem willfully ignorant at this point if you don't at least try to understand."

It's the (us) Americans who are the problem and typically prefer to go for healthier, younger males that look like pretty prizes. People from other countries including Germany prefer males who are aged an battle worn, who look like formidable opponents that have survived hell (but not their bullets). It's important for there to be rules for trophy hunters so it's the old non breeding males who are targeted, not the young healthy breeding males. Americans are selfish and stupid."

environment,3e1u7a,Theotropho,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:36:48 2015 UTC,"With animals like that, they don't target healthy breeding males, they go for the older ones who are no longer breeding but are still fighting and aggressive. That way the younger ones can contribute to the gene pool without being killed by an old grump who can't deliver anymore. So it does, in fact, contribute to conservation.  Making sure a species can persist by enabling those who are reproductively able to live healthily without competition from non breeding elders definitely helps conservation.  While I'm sure what you are saying about ""alpha males,"" though flawed (that's not how alpha works and not all populations are set up like that), has some merit in some situations, like in populations of least concern such as odocoileus virginianus, that isn't how it works with the big game trophy hunting or where conservation is an issue."

If not us, it would be Homo Habilis & neanderthals preforming the same apex-predator function as modern humans. I agree, the human condition can change for the better.

I hope it won't make to big of an impact since to study 1,500 species takes a lot of time and money and this will probably be attempt at a ""sweeping"" study, which basically means trying to make conclusions on poor data.    For example, you can't conclude that because glyphosate kills at a dose of x it kills a number of species p therefore it is toxic to species q with dose x.  There would be no data and pure assumption to it That's assuming it even takes dosages into account of course.  The article isn't clear if this is a review or a long-term goal over say 10-20 years.  If it is a longer term goal then that can't be disagreed with.    There are pesticides on all sides of agriculture, transgenics, organic and conventional we don't know too much about.

environment,3dv8y3,Ree81,2,Mon Jul 20 21:23:49 2015 UTC,"Well, it depends on how you define ""unstoppable"". It is true that the adjustment time for atmospheric carbon concentration is on the order of centuries, which means that even if emissions were halted immediately it would be hundreds of years before we got back down to 280ppm CO2.  However, it is not true that there is absolutely nothing we can do to prevent a rise in global mean temperatures. There are options, but they involve geoengineering - a topic that is very rapidly losing its taboo in the climate science community, mainly because passive mitigation of emissions just doesn't look like it's going to be enough to do the job.  In the short term, the easiest (i.e. cheapest, safest) way to prevent catastrophic warming and sea level rise is to reduce incoming solar radiation by injecting sulphate aerosols into the stratosphere. This mimics a natural process of volcanic emissions, and we already understand its effects fairly well. In the longer term, we need to begin pulling carbon out of the atmosphere. Currently the best option for CCS is reforestation and afforestation, but their capacity is limited. To do the whole job and get us back down to 280ppm CO2 we will need one or more other methods at a huge scale. Direct air CCS is probably the most ideal option, but it will probably remain too costly to do at a trillion-ton scale until we have some technological breakthroughs in machine labor (i.e. robots). Still, there is good reason to believe that such breakthroughs are only a few decades away - say, 2050s-2070s.  Of course, technical capacity is only part of the solution. We will still need political will and international agreement, which are arguably harder problems to solve!"

But, sure, whatever.  Other than the lie that cyclones and storms are increasing somehow, yeah, sea level rise is going to get us, some day.  Of course, it's just going to get us a little sooner than it was anyway.  Because we had sea level rise way back when, even in the 1800s.  Yes, it's warmer now than it was then, and thus the sea levels are rising faster now.  But, unless the rate of sea level rise increases 10 fold, and pretty soon, people buying a home in Miami today won't have to worry about abandoning it to the seas before it's paid off.

Isn't every single time the temperature goes up the ""warmest year?""   It's simply the latest one, right?  Are you saying that 1998 wasn't the warmest year on record, in 1998 or 1999?    The greenhouse effect was actually measured in the mid 1800s,    Ah, yes.  The greenhouse effect was actually measured.  So, I guess this means it must have been all due to human emissions of CO2 that warmed the planet, back in the 1850s.  What about the warming that occurred in the 900s.  Was that due to human emissions of CO2 as well?  Or, did we not have the greenhouse effect then?  The greenhouse effect has existed since we've had an atmosphere.  We didn't invent it.  Every change in temperature the world has ever seen can't have been attributed to mankind's monkeying with the greenhouse effect.  Our emissions in the 1800s were a tiny fraction of what they are today.  We can't even be sure what the effect on the temperature we're having NOW, with our huge emissions.  What effect did we have on the temperature of the planet [when our emissions were less than 1% of what we emit now?](recent data reveals that global CO₂ emissions were 150 times higher in 2011 than they were in 18501.)  Our emissions were much, much smaller at the turn of the century than they are now, and the atmospheric CO2 levels were 30% lower than they are now, but the warming from 1910 to 1944 was about the same as the warming from 1976 to 2002. Since 2002, we're emitting enough every year to cover the entire decade from 1910 to 1920, but our surface temperatures have remained roughly the same (yes, there is some warming, but the rate is on the order of 0.05º per decade, instead of the 0.16º per decade of the 1910s and 1920s).  That's 30% more CO2 in the air, 10 times the emissions rates, and one third the warming rate.  And it's not for ""a year or two,"" but for more than a decade.    Still, to listen to you guys, the only factor in the temperature of the planet is how much CO2 is in the air.   Yes. There were other, more temporary, cooling effects that were in play that have since dissipated or reversed. ENSO, for example.   We've had an El Niño in 1998, one in 2005, one in 2010, and now one building for 2015.  I'm not sure what you mean by ""dissipated or reversed"" since these or the La Niñas have not lasted for 12 years and are just now going away.  La Niña is a phenomenon where trade winds push water westward along the equatorial pacific, piling up warm water along the east coast of Asia, where it pools up and ocean currents pull it down deep, and spread the warm water north and south, causing a huge ""warm pool"" of water. Along the eastern part of this, near the coast of South America, the retreating water (that's being blown to the west) leaves a vacuum that upwelling water from the bottom of the ocean has to rise up to fill.  That upwelling water is cold and rich in nutrients.  The cold water gets pulled westward on the surface, soaking up heat from the sun.   The El Niño is the discharge part of the cycle, spreading the accumulated heat back out over the surface, and allowing the heat to escape to the atmosphere, and thus to space.  It does this when the trade winds stall, and the warm pool begins to surge back to the East (because its higher in altitude than the waters to the east, because the wind has piled it up).    I'm not sure why you think that the frequent El Niños we've been having have cooled the surface.  I don't think that is the case.  They do cool the deep waters of the western Pacific, though by allowing the surface waters to stop pushing down into the deeps.   You need to learn the difference between ""continental US"" and ""the rest of the world"".   I don't think I do.  I think the global temperature record shows warming, then cooling, then warming.  Otherwise, why did the climate scientists have to work so hard to find a cause for the 1950s and 1960s cooling that happened on a global scale?  They blamed aerosols for years, until someone showed that aerosols probably aren't the cause.  This wasn't until after they said that Chinese aerosols were the cause of the post 1998 ""pause"" and actual measurements disagreed.  Then they started looking for other reasons, until someone said, ""the pause never existed"" about six months ago.    You need to get your story straight."

environment,3dv8y3,wooder32,-2,Mon Jul 20 05:13:10 2015 UTC,"Where did I promote the use of fossil fuels.  I pointed out that 2014 being a high temperature is nothing new, since a warming world would have high temperatures every few years.    I don't believe that the change in temperature will be as rapid as the current ""consensus"" believes, and I base this on the fact that they have neglected a fairly big thing that causes decades-long changes in the rate of warming.  I've said many times on Reddit that it appears that the true warming signal is the average between the rapidly warming decades and ""flat"" or ""cooling"" decades.   The 1910 to 1945 time period saw warming of around 0.16º per decade.  Then a slight cooling for 30 years happened, and then we have warming again from 1976 to 2002, at 0.17º per decade or so.  Then, since 2003, we've seen, well it's not clear whether it's very slightly cooling, neutral, or very slightly warming.  Different agencies show different rates of change, depending on how they measure things, but it's clear that we're not warming at 0.17º per decade after 2002.   If we have a huge step change this year, where the average anomaly warms by 0.2º and stays there, it will get us back on track of the 0.17ºC per decade trend.  If we don't stay there, then this will just be a spike, and we might see a corresponding dip afterwards like we have so many times before.  Don't forget that the AMO has turned negative, and the PDO is expected to turn negative as well in the next couple of years.  Add to that the ""quiet sun"" that may impart a cooling influence of maybe a tenth of a degree, and we might just see cooling over the next 15 to 20 years.  It won't last, of course, as the cycles turn positive again, and rapid warming comes back.  It may well be stronger when it returns, continuing the increase in temperature.  So, this really isn't a ""big scare over nothing,"" and I'm not saying that we should not address it, or prepare for living in a warmer world.  Just that we may have more time than people now are claiming that we do before the consequences become something that we have to deal with."

environment,3dv8y3,Lionscard,-2,Mon Jul 20 07:10:50 2015 UTC,"we're not affecting global warming at all.   No, I actually think that we are - just not at the rate they believe that we are, and not just because of CO2.  The actual published science doesn't say ""only CO2,"" of course, but when we start talking about solutions, that's all you hear about.    The fact is, land-use changes have caused measurable amounts of warming in the areas where we live that are higher than the background warming.  I can clearly see the effects of Urban Heat Island Effect, where large cities and even small towns are demonstratively warmer than rural areas surrounding it.  The official response in the temperature reconstructions is that UHIE makes a very small difference, in a very small part of the surface of the earth, so we don't really have to do much about it.  They remove something like 0.29º from city temperatures, and then homogenize the city readings with rural readings out for many miles.    Anyway, if CO2 by itself adds 1.2º of warming at the top of the troposphere for a doubling of CO2, as the actual science claims that it will, does this translate to 3º of warming on the surface?  I don't think that it does.  It might add 1.2º at the surface, or 0.6º at the surface, or 2º at the surface.  We really just don't know, because we don't know if the warming causes an increase in convection, a change in the lapse rate, more clouds, fewer clouds, etc.  If the PDO and the AMO have had a large effect on the temperature swings in the last 120 years, and none of the current models have included the possibility of ocean cycles altering the surface record, then the conclusions based off of the relationship between the growth of CO2 and the recorded surface record are going to be faulty.  It seems to be clear that scientists are just now coming to grips with the idea that the can AMO and PDO affect global temperatures in a major way, since they are claiming that the expected 0.3º of warming that we should have been seeing in the last 12 years have been masked by the change in ocean cycles.  That's HUGE.  This changes the expected slope of warming over a longer period of time than just the last 12 years.  It lowers the overall warming due to CO2 of the period from 1976 to 2002, and raises the slope of the temperature curve of 1945 to 1975.  It smoothes things out, and shows that the warming didn't rapidly accelerate in 1979, the true temperature rise signal had been masked by the ocean cycles.  So, yes, our land-use changes do increase the warming (as documented in the IPCC documents), which means that 100% of the warming we've experienced is not necessarily due to CO2.  There are other greenhouse gases (methane, etc) at play, which also contribute, which means that it's not all about CO2.  All of which means that the expected warming due to CO2 is lower than they are projecting.  Now, does that mean that we should ignore everything and continue to burn as much coal as we want?  NO.  I'm not an advocate of burning coal.  We can stop all coal production tomorrow, and it won't bother me one bit.  I'd love to have solar panels on my house, and not have to pay the electric company a dime.  I fully plan on buying a full set of panels to charge my electric car and run my house as soon as I can afford to do so.  It may be another 5 years before I'm able, but it's in my plans.  I think that toxins released in China and Mexico and India and Brazil and other developing nations are a threat to humanity, just like the lead that was added to gasoline back in the day, and all nations should very seriously work to make sure that any fuel burned is as clean as it can be, to protect the environment.  But, when we say things like ""2014 was the hottest year on record"" and expect that to have some sort of real meaning, be some sort of call to arms, I get annoyed.  1998 was also the hottest year on record.  The 1940s had several years that had been hotter than any recorded year before then.  It's evidence that the world is still warming, but not much more than that.  It doesn't speak to the cause of the warming, or the rate of warming.  In fact, if you know anything about statistics, it's actually impossible to claim, statistically, that 2014 was hotter than 2010 or 1998.  They are all very close, in temperature, and error bars do exist.  When temperatures overlap with error estimates, we can say that 2014 is more likely to be the hottest of the three, but that's the best we can do."

There are a few calls for deforestation and we do see a lot of news articles on methane leaks from gas wells.  I take it back that ""all we hear about is CO2.""  That was hyperbole and it was wrong.     Various strawman arguments pollute your responses   Do tell...   claims of advocates ignoring other warming contributors for one   Well, this isn't the same as the claim that scientists ignore other warming contributors, but that ""advocates"" sometimes do.  Yes, I think that many climate change crusaders tend to focus on fossil fuel use way more than they should, but I do understand why the do so.  It's because they have bought into the idea that a doubling of CO2 will cause a rise in temperature that will cause catastrophic damage to mankind, if not the world.  I don't think that a doubling of CO2 will cause enough warming to cause catastrophic changes in our environment. If we were talking about all of the actions that mankind needs to take to make the world a better place, rather than focusing on getting to very low carbon dioxide emissions all the time, maybe I would not feel that ""advocates ignore other warming contributors.""  I disagree that this is a straw man argument.   Another would be claiming models ignore ocean cycles   I usually never use SkepticalScience as a source, but... please take a look at the page it's Pacific Decadal Oscillation.  On this page, there is a good discussion of what the PDO is, and why it is not ""the cause for the global warming trend.""  I believe that you referred to model runs that attempt to model the ENSO, to show that back and forth El Niño/La Niña events can perturb the warming signal temporarily, and you might think that's what I've been talking about.  It is not.  I'm talking about a combination of AMO and PDO and possibly other cycles that we have not highlighted yet that most certainly do affect the surface temperature on a several-decade basis.  The SkepticalScience page uses the fact that the PDO is an oscillation with equal positive and negative parts so show that it has a long term trend of zero, and thus is not the cause of Global Warming.  I agree.  It is not the cause of global warming.  Since it's not the cause of global warming, we discount it and move on, right?  Not so fast...  If we take the oscillation of the PDO and add in the oscillation of the AMO and then add a small warming signal on top of those, we get a curve that looks one whole hell of a lot like the temperature curve we get from observations.  Add in the big volcanoes and we have a pretty good match.  The thing is, the PDO has a 60 year cycle, which began its upward climb right around 1975 (give or take a year or so).  That would put the peak of it around 2005 (give or take).  If we just assume that all of the warming we've seen comes from an increase in CO2 greenhouse gases, and claim that ocean cycles are zero sum, we then can show ""falling temperatures from 1945 until CO2 rose high enough to overcome the natural forces to begin climbing.  Global warming is accelerating, and the world warmed at 0.17º to 0.19º per decade through the 1990s, and we expect it to warm at 0.2º or higher per decade after 2005.""  They did not ""ignore"" the ocean cycles, they declared that the cycles were not climbing, therefore they did not cause the warming, and so they did not include them in the models that predict future warming.  They did simulate ENSO, but then declared that ENSO was just random noise that didn't affect the overall trend, either.     Why pseudoskeptics are so bent on minimizing CO2's impact to the point of fanaticism:   From the linked article:   A series of investigations published last year by Prof Stephan Lewandowsky and his colleagues – including one with the fantastic title, Nasa Faked the Moon Landing – Therefore, (Climate) Science Is a Hoax: An Anatomy of the Motivated Rejection of Science – found that while subjects subscribing to conspiracist thought tended to reject all scientific propositions they encountered, those with strong traits of conservatism or pronounced free-market world views only tended to reject scientific findings with regulatory implications.   So, which am I?  Do I reject all scientific propositions?  Or am I so married to free market world views that I can't stand any scientific findings with regulatory implications?  How about this...  I suggest that you go ahead and implement regulations. I will support your decision to immediately begin high taxation on coal and oil. Let's enact a 100% tax on gasoline, on top of what's already there.  Let's do that tomorrow.  Lets do the same thing for coal, so that the electric companies have no choice but to switch to something else or go broke.  We can take all of the tax money collected to give subsidies to companies who invest in solar and wind generation, and electric vehicle infrastructure, like Level 3 EVSE chargers.  I will call my Congressmen and tell them that I support that legislation as soon as it's available for them to consider.  I promise that.  Now, I STILL think that the impact of additional CO2 is about a third of what they are claiming that it is.  I think that our current temperature datasets are showing warmer than reality because of the way homogenization works and because of the low value they give to UHIE.  I think that the ocean cycles affect the surface temperature (in opposing ways) for 30 years at a stretch, and the climate scientists misinterpreted the warming of the 30 year period between 1976 and 2005 as being 100% caused by Greenhouse gases, and they built their projections based on this.  But, hey.  What do I know, right?  I just get all of my info from blogs written by people who want to drill for oil.  Or... maybe not."

Where CAGW originates from...  http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/CAGW  Another debate tactic, similar to strawman creation, is to focus on the most extreme arguments from your opposition.  I haven't met anyone (climate concerned or not) who thinks only CO2 influences climate.  I do know some who correctly note that CO2 is the most important influence to reduce, although many don't know just how bad it really is.  The OP sort of touches on it.  CO2 will be influencing climate much longer than say methane.   They did not ""ignore"" the ocean cycles, they declared that the cycles were not climbing, therefore they did not cause the warming, and so they did not include them in the models that predict future warming.    Amusing assertion.  By the same logic, volcanoes, solar activity, ENSO, and sulfates are not attributed to recent warming.  Therefore, let's just declare that scientists must be ignoring them in climate models.    Individual model runs do simulate extended changes in ENSO conditions (which is really what PDO is).  http://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2310.epdf   The thing is, the PDO has a 60 year cycle, which began its upward climb right around 1975 (give or take a year or so). That would put the peak of it around 2005 (give or take). If we just assume that all of the warming we've seen comes from an increase in greenhouse gases   Lots wrong with this.  First, you put no timeframe on attribution to greenhouse gases.  Internal variation (ENSO/PDO/etc.) can have large influences on decadal trends, moderate influences in multi-decade trends, and little over 50-year timeframes compared to forcings.     and the climate scientists misinterpreted the warming of the 30 year period between 1976 and 2005 as being 100% caused by Greenhouse gases, and they built their projections based on this.   Do tell.  1975-2005 trends were above average model projections (more so if you stop in 1998, a PDO peak).  Scientists studying trends at the time listed the top candidate for the discrepancy as internal variability - some of the warming due to natural influences.  This was also noted when observing 1992-2006, a paper written by those darn climate scientists pseudoskeptics hate.    http://www.skepticalscience.com/Double-Standard-on-Internal-Variability_Tamino.html  If models were sound, one would expect at least a short-term slowdown in surface warming, more so if forcings are in the negative direction as well.  http://www.skepticalscience.com/ipcc-model-gw-projections-done-better-than-you-think.html  Since PDO/AMO has close to zero influence long-term, it's not going to affect warming projections this century.   we then can show ""falling temperatures from 1945 until CO2 rose high enough to overcome the natural forces to begin climbing.    Pseudoskeptics seem to over-emphasize PDO based on the slight cooling observed 1945-1975.  Remember that greenhouse gas forcing was less then, and the cooling influence from aerosols was higher.  It's important to examine all of the evidence or you end up with predictions like this:  http://www.skepticalscience.com/year-after-mclean-review-of-2011-global-temperatures.html  There are somewhat more sophisticated attempts beyond curve-fitting but they haven't done too well.  http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/05/how-to-cook-a-graph-in-three-easy-lessons/   and we expect it to warm at 0.2º or higher per decade after 2005.   About right (a number that will rise with high emissions scenarios later in the century), but remember again that model runs show trends varying from cooling to warming at the decade level.   Now, I STILL think that the impact of additional CO2 is about a third of what they are claiming that it is.   Or more precisely, what you want to think   I think that our current temperature datasets are showing warmer than reality because of the way homogenization works and because of the low value they give to UHIE   The published studies disagree with you.  https://agwobserver.wordpress.com/2009/12/27/papers-on-urban-heat-island/   We can take all of the tax money collected to give subsidies to companies who invest in solar and wind generation   Better to return most as a dividend to consumers, as most current proposals contain.  Carbon pricing by itself is good incentive for low carbon energy sources.  But nice to see you expend so much effort on many of your posts indicating how green you are.  Anthony Watts reminds people he likes solar panels.  The hope is to make his fervent anti-science views seem more credible among those favoring emissions reductions.   But, hey.

An honest question, here.  Rather than assuming that I'm trying to discredit the idea of global warming by focusing on the most extreme arguments of the opposition, could you possibly consider the possibility that I merely disagree that the evidence supports the idea that the most extreme claims are very likely?    If I were going going to bet money on a conjecture, I would place my money on the most likely, not the least likely.  If a scientist said, ""there's a 5% chance that doing nothing will have no effect on your health, a 10% chance that doing nothing will cause a small but measurable discomfort, a 70% chance that doing nothing will cause you some moderate ill effects, and a 10% chance that doing nothing will cause some severe effects, and a 5% chance doing nothing will cause very serious effects,"" I would assume that the very largest percentage of chances are that the effects are ""not severe.""    The fear-mongers tend to focus on the 5%, telling me constantly that I should be very afraid, because there is a chance that all hell will break loose, and it will be MY FAULT.    I look at the trends, and the science behind the projections, and just don't see the justification behind the panic.  Sure, the science does certainly tell us that GHGs, due to their nature, absorb and emit IR.  I know why (because I read a couple of text-books on the subject, and I've got a couple of degrees in science that allow me to understand the physics that are at play).  I would be happy to take a full college course (or even a more indepth study, leading to a degree) in the subject, but to be honest, I can't afford it.  But, I've indulged quite a few of ""the opposition"" over the years in their demand that I study some text or other to fix my ignorance.    What I've found is that any statement that I make that doesn't agree with what someone thinks the authority position is, even when backed up by logic, observations, peer reviewed papers, or direct quotes from Hansen himself, are met with scorn and derision by those who are secure in their knowledge that I'm a stupid skeptic (or in your words, a pseudo skeptic), and simply can't be right.  For the record, I think we won't know for decades.  You think you know now, but the actual scientists are on record saying that it could be as low as 1.5º C per doubling.  We're currently about halfway to a doubling, and are somewhere between 0.8ºC and 1ºC above pre-industrial temperatures.  Increasing levels of GHGs are governed by logarithmic growth (not exponential growth).  If you know math, then you should know that the first half of a logarithmic curve rises faster than the second half, assuming a steady increase in the causing factor.    CO2 and other man-made GHGs are growing at an exponential pace, but that just means that we'll get to the doubling sooner, not how much a doubling will affect the temperature.  Claims of positive feedback on other things depend on rising temperatures.  Ice albedo, for example seems to be split between the Arctic (positive) and Antarctic (negative).  Humidity in middle and upper-level troposphere seems to be trending negative which suggests the opposite of a positive feedback.  On of the positive feedbacks that are expected is the die-off of vegetation as drought increases with temperature.  According to the actual observations, drought is currently still showing no trend (neither increasing nor decreasing) The IPCC's own report says, ""In summary, the current assessment concludes that there is not enough evidence at present to suggest more than low confidence in a global-scale observed trend in drought or dryness (lack of rainfall) since the middle of the 20th century, due to lack of direct observations, geographical inconsistencies in the trends, and dependencies of inferred trends on the index choice.""  Even so, the world is greening.  More vegetation is growing on our planet. This is opposite of what was forecast, and could be considered a negative feedback.  Maybe.  Or maybe an unanticipated positive benefit from increased CO2 and warming.  So, for various reasons, even if you think they must be bunk (because someone told you so), I think that we will end up on the lower side of the IPCC projections, where there is less of a reason to panic. You may feel free to think I'm crazy or stupid.  This doesn't really bother me."

Global warming is to a large extent a risk management problem, however.  As such, we can't ignore the tail end risk.  The risk of a devastating tsunami hitting the west coast is small over the next 20 years.  Doesn't mean it should be ignored and only plan for the most likely occurrence.  Of course, that's a potential local disaster, not a global one.  http://climatechangenationalforum.org/tail-risk-vs-alarmism/   The fear-mongers tend to focus on the 5%, telling me constantly that I should be very afraid, because there is a chance that all hell will break loose, and it will be MY FAULT.

This class is free!  https://www.coursera.org/course/globalwarming  Warning though: you might learn why CO2 is the most important greenhouse gas to reduce.  It also requires both a time commitment (which from your lengthy posts you probably have enough of) and a good faith intention to learn.

I've not seen you back anything up with observations or papers, and have used various logical fallacies to argue your position (another one here).  What I try to do is examine all published work on a topic.  If there is a contrarian paper, I try to understand why it disagrees.  Are there rebuttals?  What I find is done regularly on pseudoskeptic blogs is both a misrepresentation of papers and a tendency to be very selective with what is promoted.   You think you know now, but the actual scientists are on record saying that it could be as low as 1.5º C per doubling.    Or just as (un)likely, 4.5 C.  Remember that the 1.5-4.5 range follows a typical distribution where values close to the center are more likely than those around the edge.  In all cases, it's not a ""third"" of median or mean estimates.   We're currently about halfway to a doubling, and are somewhere between 0.8ºC and 1ºC above pre-industrial temperatures. Increasing levels of GHGs are governed by logarithmic growth (not exponential growth). If you know math, then you should know that the first half of a logarithmic curve rises faster than the second half, assuming a steady increase in the causing factor.   Remember also the delay between forcing and observed increases.  TCR is lower than ECS.  Aerosols also partially reduce the expected warming.   Ice albedo, for example seems to be split between the Arctic (positive) and Antarctic (negative).    Ice albedo feedback (not just sea ice, which is globally trending downward, but ice sheets and glaciers) is positive globally.   Humidity in middle and upper-level troposphere seems to be trending negative which suggests the opposite of a positive feedback.   Paltridge et al was refuted.  http://geotest.tamu.edu/userfiles/216/Dessler10.pdf  Looking at the rest of the published studies shows observations of water vapor feedback are positive.  This is an example of what I refer to above as latching on to a single study, ignoring rebuttals and the rest, then claiming things like ""seems to be trending negative"".   https://agwobserver.wordpress.com/2009/10/13/papers-on-water-vapor-feedback-observations/  I could also point out that Paltridge has been engaged in various skeptic/political organizations like The Institute of Petroleum but rather not go there.  EDIT: For an intuitive summary of the water vapor feedback,  https://www.skepticalscience.com/humidity-global-warming.htm  or read section 2.5.5 of AR5.  http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_Chapter02_FINAL.pdf   On of the positive feedbacks that are expected is the die-off of vegetation as drought increases with temperature.    Actually, a decline in vegetation, such as what's happened in the Amazon, would indicate higher positive feedbacks than average models (these incorporate CO2 fertilization) show.  http://www.pnas.org/content/111/45/16041  Another impact models could underestimate is the observed weakening of carbon sinks.  http://www.biogeosciences.net/11/3453/2014/bg-11-3453-2014.pdf   So, for various reasons, even if you think they must be bunk (because someone told you so), I think that we will end up on the lower side of the IPCC projections, where there is less of a reason to panic.    To take the opposite extreme, I suppose I could highlight papers like these that show 3 C to be the lower bound for ECS, with best estimate much higher.  http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v505/n7481/full/nature12829.html  By focusing on the anomalous evidence, dubious (""various reasons"") or not, and ignoring the rest, I can reach conclusions showing projections to be woefully conservative.  However, being objective means looking at all of the evidence."

Do you think we've been warming for over 130 years and never had a record year before? It should be obvious that warming over a long period of time would see temperatures in the oceans and over the land that are higher than they had been before. That's the definition of ""warming,"" is it not?   And we keep getting higher and higher high points....almost like heat is building up in the system.   So, yes, 1932 was a high point when measured against all the years between 1880 and 1932. You can contest it all you want. The data are not controversial.    The data isn't controversial, but your use of it is classic cherry picking.   Why would I need to provide citations? Am I writing a term paper for school? No. Look it up yourself.   So, you get to pull whatever claims you want out of your ass, and I have to spend my time to research and prove you wrong?  Sorry.  It doesn't work like that.  Your claim, your responsibility to back it.   and being the ""warmest year on record"" is some special thing in a world where it's been warming since the coldest part of the Little Ice Age?   The little ice age was just that.  Little.  We have ""recovered"" from it about 150 years ago.  Additionally, it was a regional event, not a global one.     Isn't every single time the temperature goes up the ""warmest year?"" It's simply the latest one, right? Are you saying that 1998 wasn't the warmest year on record, in 1998 or 1999?    According to the instrumental record, 1998 is currently the 4th warmest year.  2005 and 2010 are tied for 2nd, and 2014 is the current leader.  However, if 2015 continues as it has so far (and there is no reason to think it won't), then everybody is going to get to move down a step.  Reconstructions of past temperatures indicate that these are the warmest years it at least several centuries.   Ah, yes. The greenhouse effect was actually measured. So, I guess this means it must have been all due to human emissions of CO2 that warmed the planet, back in the 1850s. What about the warming that occurred in the 900s. Was that due to human emissions of CO2 as well? Or, did we not have the greenhouse effect then?   Straw man argument.  Nobody is claiming that human CO2 emissions are a cause of warming prior to industrialization.     The greenhouse effect has existed since we've had an atmosphere. We didn't invent it. Every change in temperature the world has ever seen can't have been attributed to mankind's monkeying with the greenhouse effect.   Correct.  However, the particular event we are going through now has our grubby little fingerprints all over it.   Our emissions in the 1800s were a tiny fraction of what they are today.   Correct.   We can't even be sure what the effect on the temperature we're having NOW, with our huge emissions.    Incorrect, and an argument from ignorance.   Our emissions were much, much smaller at the turn of the century than they are now, and the atmospheric CO2 levels were 30% lower than they are now,   I will assume you mean the turning of the last century.  I'd like you to answer this question for me.  Given that we know that CO2 is part of the pre-existing greenhouse effect, and is in fact the largest forcing agent in the atmosphere*, how could increasing CO2 concentrations by 30% NOT have an effect on the planets thermal equilibrium?  *Water is the greatest overall agent, but due to the ease which it saturates as vapor and its ease of precipitating out, it is considered more of a feedback than a forcing agent.   What effect did we have on the temperature of the planet [when our emissions were less than 1% of what we emit now?   In terms of CO2, even less than 1%.  Do you think that we are the only factor in play?   Our emissions were much, much smaller at the turn of the century than they are now, and the atmospheric CO2 levels were 30% lower than they are now, but the warming from 1910 to 1944 was about the same as the warming from 1976 to 2002. Since 2002, we're emitting enough every year to cover the entire decade from 1910 to 1920, but our surface temperatures have remained roughly the same (yes, there is some warming, but the rate is on the order of 0.05º per decade, instead of the 0.16º per decade of the 1910s and 1920s).   Key word: surface.  And by that, you also probably also mean land surface.  Have a look at the oceans are doing if you want to understand what's going on.     That's 30% more CO2 in the air, 10 times the emissions rates, and one third the warming rate. And it's not for ""a year or two,"" but for more than a decade.    Look to the sea, child.  Look to the sea.   We've had an El Niño in 1998, one in 2005, one in 2010, and now one building for 2015. I'm not sure what you mean by ""dissipated or reversed"" since these or the La Niñas have not lasted for 12 years and are just now going away.    ENSO (which means both halves of the cycle) is only one of the factors in play.  You also have fluctuations in solar output (a cycle that can reverse), and increased albedo changes due to volcanic eruptions (dissipation).  And why do you think I would argue that a La Nina would last for 12 years when we have had El Ninos in those years?  Do you think that I don't understand that they are part of the same system?   ...I'm not sure why you think that the frequent El Niños we've been having have cooled the surface. I don't think that is the case. They do cool the deep waters of the western Pacific, though by allowing the surface waters to stop pushing down into the deeps.   I'm not sure why you would think I said that.  Oh right.  Straw man argument again.     ...I think the global temperature record shows warming, then cooling, then warming.    And somehow, always hitting new records, almost like you've got a noisy sine wave on top of an exponential curve.....   Otherwise, why did the climate scientists have to work so hard to find a cause for the 1950s and 1960s cooling that happened on a global scale?    Because they were still learning?  Nobody ever said that CO2 is the only factor in play.     have to work so hard to find a cause for the 1950s and 1960s cooling that happened on a global scale? They blamed aerosols for years, until someone showed that aerosols probably aren't the cause.   Who showed that aerosols probably weren't the cause?  Citation required.   This wasn't until after they said that Chinese aerosols were the cause of the post 1998 ""pause"" and actual measurements disagreed.    Who said that Chinese aeorsols were the cause of the slowdown post 1998?  BTW: measuring trends from a peak is a big mistake, at least, if you are interested in an honest analysis.  Again, citation required.   Then they started looking for other reasons, until someone said, ""the pause never existed"" about six months ago.    Look to the sea, child.  Look to the sea.   You need to get your story straight.   You need to go back to your story books and leave the adults get back to their work."
environment,3dv8y3,Beltaine421,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:48:37 2015 UTC,"You, like many others, mistake my point.  The whole hew and cry of claiming that 2014 is ""the warmest year ever"" is that we're in a warming world.  Of course we're going to have ""the warmest year ever"" in a warming world.  It's going to happen frequently.  It's not surprising in any way, and it's not some sort of cause for renewed alarm.  You several people have reacted to me pointing out that in a warming world, we're going to have multiple ""record years,"" each one as we get to them.  Then, they said, ""oh, no, those are't record years, 2014 is higher than them.""  But, what I was pointing out is that in 1998, or when doing the calculations in 1999, the year 1998 was, at that point, a record year.  Hooray!  It's a new record.  But, like I said, so was 1944.  If we were sitting around in 1946 and asked ""what was the hottest year on record,"" it would be 1944.    So, the point isn't that all of these years were hotter than 2014.  It was that they were hotter than all of the years on record that came before them.  It's like celebrating every morning because you're the oldest that you've ever been.  Other people look at it and say, ""well, yeah, that's the way it works.""  But, maybe that was too subtle for you to grasp, and you just focused on the thought that 2014 is hotter than the other years. It's a ""new record.""    The fact is the world is warming and has been warming for as long as we've been measuring it.  The seas have been rising for as long as we've been measuring the sea level.  Articles like this are written purely to remind people that they should be in a panic, that they should be afraid.  After all, 2014 is a Record Year!!!  The seas are at a Record Height!  and they are STILL RISING!!!  and CO2 has risen over 6 ppm since the beginning of 2013!!!!   Look to the sea, child. Look to the sea.   Okay.  [I see a couple of hot spots, anomalous warming, in the Northern Pacific, and the typical Niño build-up in equatorial Pacific)(http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/sst/anomaly/2015/anomnight.7.20.2015.gif).  There are two cold areas in northern high latitudes that more-or-less cancel out the hot areas, and the southern hemisphere looks to be cooler, on average, than the baseline.  The Indian Ocean, typically, is uniformly warm, but not excessively so.  I know, you wanted me to look at that Ocean Heat Content graph that they created in Joules a few years ago, right?  the one that shows a steady and alarming climb over the last 70 years, with the last 20 years highlighted?  the one that makes it look like the oceans have gone up like 10 times the amount of heat energy the contained back in the 1950s?    Yeah, we were talking about temperature, not ""heat energy.""  Sorry.  If we'd had a good, reliable way to measure the ""heat energy"" of the oceans all the way down to 2000 meters for the last 2000 years, I'd certainly like to see it.  It would be fascinating.  But, we're still very much lacking in good coverage of the vastness of the oceans, and the temperature difference that they actually measure is very small.  If you want to say that we should not look at the temperature of the surface as our guide to see how much the temperature of the surface is changing, then why do the scientists project their doom based on surface temperatures?  They don't say, ""we must stop using fossil fuels or the oceans 300 meters down will gain heat energy by 1.353 X 1023 Joules.""  There is a reason for that.  A change in heat energy of (this is a fictional number, pulled out of my ass - feel free to substitute a real one), would be a difference in actual temperature of about 0.0035º C, one that no one, even the fish living at 300 meters down, will notice or care about.  So, what are the oceans doing at depth, anyway?  A paper published about a year ago) from MIT and Harvard professors, Wunsch and Heimbach, Oceanographers, suggests that the oceans have not been warming as much recently as others have thought. Large parts of the oceans could actually be cooling instead of warming. They could be wrong, but the fact is, the issue is complex and our data collection is sparse.    Even if the oceans continue to warm (and, to be honest, I think that's fairly likely), the temperatures involved are very small.  Yes, it takes an incredible amount of heat energy to warm an entire ocean.  But, the oceans have been there the entire time that humans have been adding to CO2 levels.  They've been absorbing heat energy the entire time as well.  As I said, it takes an incredible amount of heat energy to warm an entire ocean, so they would likely come to equilibrium very slowly.  Not in a year, not in a decade, not in three decades, not in 15 decades.    What was going on 15 decades ago?  Oh, yeah, the Little Ice Age.  The oceans cooled for several hundred years during that time, and it will take several hundred years, at least, for them to come back to equilibrium now that our surface is warmer.  So, it's no wonder that they are warming.  If you really think that the warming increase in OHC that we're seeing today is purely because of the increased CO2 that we've introduced into the atmosphere in the last 100 years, you have no concept of how much energy it really takes to warm the ocean basins.   I'm not saying that we are not affecting the surface.  I'm not saying that we're not affecting the depths.  What I am saying is that there is the distinct possibility that the projections of surface warming that the IPCC have made need to be re-evaluated in light of the idea that sometimes the oceans absorb more of the energy into their massive heat sink than they do at other times.    The problems associated with warming: ice melting on Greenland, for example, or desertification of Africa, etc. are associated with surface warming, not with a tiny fraction of a degree of warming of water hundreds of meters deep in the ocean.  One caveat; sea level rise is directly associated with ocean warming, and it's a problem that won't go away anytime soon.  So, unless you wish to continue to mis-interpret my claim that new record highs are not the evidence of anything except that warming of the entire planet has not actually stopped (and I have said consistently for years that it has not), can we move on?"

A paper published about a year ago) from MIT and Harvard professors, Wunsch   Not going to bother with the rest of your creative writing but will focus on the one citation you claim supports ""the oceans have not been warming as much recently as others have thought"".  This was misrepresented badly by the usual suspects, and even prompted Wunsch to write a letter to the editor.    http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2014/07/scientists-lambast-the-australian-for-misleading-article-on-deep-ocean-cooling/  First, the negative trend found in the abyss (> 3600 m depth, 18% of total ocean volume I believe) is very small.  The entire trend below 2000 m is 10% of the trends above 2000 m.  http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JPO-D-13-096.1  Another paper also showed a best estimate of a slight negative trend in the abyss but with a margin of error exceeding several times the estimate, so the paper could not conclude warming/cooling at that level.  This is because measurements in the abyss are sparse compared to > 2000 m.  In contrast, uncertainties above 2000 m are smaller, and note the 0.77 of total heat content change (including the slight abyss cooling) is a little higher than recent estimates.  ""Over the entire water column, independent estimates of ocean warming yield a contribution of 0.77 ± 0.28 mm yr−1 in sea-level rise""  http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n11/full/nclimate2387.html  OHC 0-2000 m:  https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/3M_HEAT_CONTENT/heat_content2000m.png  As Wunsch noted in the carbonbrief article:  ""Contrary to the implications of Lloyd's article, parts of the deep ocean are warming, parts are cooling, and although the global abyssal average is negative, the value is tiny in a global warming context.""  and  ""A quote from Dr Andy Hogg of Australia's National University at the end of the Australian article explains parts of the very deep ocean can take a very long time (centuries to millennia) to respond to what's happening at the surface.  Hogg adds:  ""So if cooling has occurred over large parts of the abyssal ocean, it is unrelated to global warming of the atmosphere over the last century.""  Hogg adds that while there is still some uncertainty about temperatures in the deep ocean, shallower regions are well understood and Wunsch's findings are ""consistent"" with warming oceans.  Wunsch told us he thought Hogg's comments were ""on the mark,"" and that it was a shame that they are ""hidden at the end"" of the article.""  Where there is the greater uncertainty (in the upper oceans) is part of the southern oceans, and this had lead to a likely underestimation of the trend since at least 1970.  Looking at all of the evidence, another paper found that upper ocean heat content is higher than previously-estimated.  http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v4/n11/full/nclimate2389.html  Increasing ocean heat isn't a good thing.  It makes its way back to the surface eventually as a slow positive feedback.  It only temporarily masks the consequences of human activities.  EDIT  Just saw this new study.  Broadly similar to Durack et al but more quantified, the 0-700 m layer has warmed a little faster than previously estimated and higher than the mean model projection, although it looks to be within uncertainty bounds (only a 15% difference between models and estimate).  It does appear that OHC trends, at least 0-700 m, are going to be on the high side of previous uncertainty ranges.  http://english.cas.cn/newsroom/research_news/201506/t20150617_148976.shtml"

If we continue to have worsening racial tensions because inadequately trained and/or inadequately supervised police in highly racially sensitive areas, serious anti-establishment racially based agitation among the blacks and latinos, and overall lack of common sense in our legislators, we're going to have more and more riots and random killings leading up to a race war here in the US.

environment,3dv8y3,BandarSeriBegawan,0,Mon Jul 20 14:18:15 2015 UTC,"Adopt drastically different lifestyles?  I guess I'd have to ask you what you mean by ""drastically different lifestyles.""  I think it's clear that we have reached a point where we should be moving away from most fossil fuels, for a variety of reasons, and use other energy sources.  That's not a ""drastically different lifestyle"" though.  I also think that we should move away from the free-for-all use of petroleum based plastics.  This is an environmental issue that is unrelated to CO2 levels or surface temperature records. It does impact the use of oil, which is kind of related to the solutions recommended for the problem of climate change. Because there are plant-based alternatives for plastics, and we can use ""reusable"" containers in a great many places that we currently use disposable plastic containers, I don't think this will require a ""drastic"" change to lifestyles.  We are over fishing our oceans. This needs to change in a very big way, and it does have some society altering implications, but not drastic ones.  Wild caught fish needs to be much more highly regulated, on a global basis, with careful monitoring on the health of the global fish populations.  Fish will, unfortunately, become much more expensive, but...  Our use of pesticides is starting to cause problems.  I've talked to a neurologist, who did her PhD. dissertation on the effects of pesticides on the nervous systems of developing children.  She had clear evidence that the increasing use of pesticides has caused marked and permanent degradation in fine motor skills in children.  I can't imagine what decades of exposure are doing to us.  I know that we're living longer, so either the exposure is not shortening our lives, or else other factors are lengthening our lives more than the pesticide use is degrading it.  But, what if we are all less capable than we would be without all the pesticides?    Again, this is a change in how we farm, not a change in the lifestyles of individuals.  Is pesticide use at our current levels going to cause a species wide catastrophe?  Well, if it continues to kill off our bee population, and continue to build up in the environment over time, maybe it will.  Now, if you're specifically talking about everyone becoming vegan, and never eating meat, living like ants in massive centrally managed urban centers, giving up any personal vehicles, giving up climate control, or other drastic changes, all in an attempt to stave off CO2 caused warming of (pick your amount of warming that you think will happen) over the next few decades, over the next 85 years, and/or over the next 1000 years, I'd respond that we don't have a good enough handle on CO2's primary effect on the surface of the planet, or the extra climactic effect of that primary warming on factors like wind, clouds, absolute humidity just below the tropopause, the lapse rate, etc.  Then, we don't know how much the combined atmospheric warming will affect polar ice albedo, polar oceanic solar energy absorption due to a loss of ice, increased polar oceanic energy loss due to a lack of the insulating effect of floating sea ice, increase in growing seasons in high latitude lands, melting of permafrost (that will release trapped CH4), etc.  So, it's possible that we should make changes for reasons other than temperature, and it's also possible that we need to make some changes to prevent temperature issues that will endanger the species in a few decades.  Or, we might have plenty of time to figure out how to deal with rising seas and a change in weather patterns due to an increase in temperature.  Our current lifestyles are very different than the lifestyles of people who lived 300 years ago.  We will adopt drastically different lifestyles over the course of the next 100 years in any case.  I have no problem with you trying to shape the direction of the inevitable change to create more sustainable, less impacting way of living.  I have a problem with people telling me that a species-wide catastrophe is guaranteed if we don't make the changes they want to happen without better evidence for those catastrophes.  I'm all for living better.  Just not for lying to scare people into doing what I want them to do."

Japanese government have rigorous testing protocols on the edibles they grow and export, and headlines like ""Japan Green Tea Exports Banned Due to High Radiation Levels"" are nothing but clickbait sensationalism.

There is no doubt in my mind.”  We also heard from Dr Robin Mesnage of the Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics at Kings College in London, who revealed new data analysis showing Round Up, the most common brand of Glyphosate based herbicides, is 1,000 times more toxic than Glyphosate alone due to the inlusion of other toxic chemicals in its mix.""  http://www.soilassociation.org/news/newsstory/articleid/8110/soil-association-calls-for-ban-on-glyphosate-the-world-s-most-widely-sold-weedkiller"
environment,3dxzns,Crayz9000,6,Mon Jul 20 14:21:25 2015 UTC,"Oh, you mean the IARC report? Let's dig into that some more (following the link I posted):   The IARC decision on glyphosate was based on a limited selection of studies (vs decades of government studies demonstrating that glyphosate poses no significant risk to human health). Industry groups have condemned the report as cherry-picking on the basis of a few studies and ignoring the majority. For example, six reputable studies giving glyphosate a clean bill of health were proposed but ignored by the panel. The decision was concluded after a week-long meeting in IARC’s Lyon offices (vs a four-year study by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), appointed as EU rapporteur assessing 30 studies on glyphosate that found no relationship between glyphosate and increased risks of cancer). See (in German) how the BfR condemned the IARC report. IARC listed the chemical as a probable carcinogen (Category 2A), in the same way that coffee and any pickled vegetables are probably carcinogenic. For the record, IARC considers sunlight as a known carcinogen (Category 1) but I don’t see regulators banning people from going outside. If one actually reads the Lancet summary of the monograph (most activists and media sources only quoted the one sentence in the short abstract in front of the paywall), the IARC conclusion on glyphosate is “There was limited evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of glyphosate.”  The IARC press release also admits that the glyphosate studies do not show evidence of cancer in humans, but tries to argue that there were three studies on animals indicating cancer risks (on mice) and that seemed to be enough to justify the 2A classification. They used another study to try to make the link to humans, and the author of that study lashed out that IARC got it “totally wrong”. Why is IARC trying so hard to link this chemical to cancer in humans? IARC waited to publish the press release on their study, embargoing it until the eve of the Europe-wide, activist campaign event known as Pesticides Action Week. Is this good science or good activist campaigning? Is IARC neutral and responsible or captured by the environmental NGO shills who know how to conduct effective PR campaigns? One of the key players on the IARC working group behind this rueful study is Christopher J. Portier – an activist from the American anti-pesticides NGO, the Environmental Defense Fund who was the 17th scientist on this panel of experts (listed in the Lancet publication as the invited specialist). There did not seem to be any question of conflict of interest."

environment,3dvr26,mycoborg,3,Mon Jul 20 03:34:10 2015 UTC,"The standard.  Maybe above average in some ways, but not the exception.  As far as size, I would say that we are an ""average big farm"".  There are people who farm a few hundred acres, but they have off-farm employment and just do it part time.  Most farms are in the 3,000 to 6,000 acre range, with a few in the 10,000 acre area.  In other parts of Western Canada (Saskatchewan, and northern Alberta) where land is less expensive, farms are even larger (some being 20,000+ acres).  As far as farming practices, zero-tillage farming is the norm.  Lots of farmers would be soil-testing their fields every year and experimenting with precision farming (variable rate fertilizing, etc).  A decent number of farmers have university degrees (usually B.Sc in Agriculture, but there are others who have different professional degrees and worked off-farm before returning to their family farms).  I hope I didn't come across as having written this to toot my own horn.  I wanted to raise awareness about some of the things that conventional farmers as a whole (a group who are often vilified) are doing to ensure that their farms are as sustainable as possible."

environment,3dvr26,Iconoclast674,2,Mon Jul 20 05:25:47 2015 UTC,"Your point about yield is well put.  The worst case is 34% yield reduction for organic.  The source you cited also said there was a range of yield differences.    When you take into account drought conditions, organic stands up very well.  The Rodale 31 year study says organic fairs better in yield overall, taking into account drought conditions--which we will be facing more often due to climate change.  http://rodaleinstitute.org/our-work/farming-systems-trial/farming-systems-trial-30-year-report/"
environment,3dvr26,dtiftw,4,Mon Jul 20 01:56:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with the Rodale report, so I would have to spend some time digging in to it to comment much on it.  It is from a ""non-profit dedicated to pioneering organic farming"" - I am not saying that it is biased, but just keep in mind where they are coming from when reviewing it (everyone, myself included, has preconceived notions that can cloud their viewpoint).  From a quick glance, it is focused on American corn-soybean farming, which is quite different from the Western Canadian system I am familiar with.  Crop rotations in Western Canada are often more diverse than in the American mid-west.  Wheat, canola, barley, peas, flax and oats are all commonly part of rotations here, versus the corn-soybean rotation that seems to be common in the mid-west.  I believe that our soil is often higher in organic matter as well.  Our lack of heat units is the main thing limiting what we can grow (ex: corn, vegetables, etc).  As far as organic fairing better in drought years, I think the main factors would be their tillage practices and the organic matter of the soil.  If they were bringing in organic matter (manure, compost, etc) to build organic matter in the organic plots, and if the organic matter was low in the conventional plots, then the organic soil would have had more stored moisture (soil higher in organic matter holds more water).  An area with soils naturally high in organic matter likely wouldn't exhibit this difference.  And the organic system is likely dependent on importing organic matter from conventional land (ex: manure from animals fed conventional grain).  As far as tillage, whichever system was utilizing the least amount of tillage would have fared better, as tilled soil dries out much quicker than soil that hasn't been disturbed.  As far as yields go, I have seen data that suggests that it is even worse than 30% less...  A Canadian agriculture newspaper compiled data from the Manitoba and Saskatchewan crop insurance systems and found yields for organic wheat were often 1/3 of yields from conventional.  This is by no means peer-reviewed science, but it is interesting none the less.  http://www.producer.com/2015/07/can-organic-ever-catch-up-with-conventional/  Agriculture is very diverse - what works for one crop might not work for another; and what works in one region may not work somewhere else.  I think the main point I was hoping to get across by posting this is that things aren't as ""cut and dried"" as ""organic is better"", or ""conventional is better"".  Rather, it is important that farmers are able to run their individual farms as efficiently as possible, balancing environmental conservation with the need to feed a growing population at a reasonable cost.

Well for one, comparing the scale of organic pesticide application of pyrethrum to the industrial scale of both synthetic insecticide and herbicide used in conventional farming is laughable. Just in terms of gallons sprayed on number of acres annually.  The reductionist approach to yield isnt relevant for organic vegetable or seed production, the way it is for commodity traded agricultural products. With corn, wheat and soy all being publicly traded, it creates a far different economic landscape than perishable heirloom tomato production or baby leaf spinach. I think you would be hard pressed to find any organic farm attempting to be active in commodities.  The references to tillage seem to disregard organic cover cropping rotations, or even no spray-no till approaches.  The nutrient argument is based on agronomy, and has zero reference to the  relative nutrition or level of phytonutrients or lower pesticide rates of organic produce.  The author did get one thing right. Organic farms wont be operating on 5200 acres.  I wonder how much of that corn and soy actually ends up as ""food"", rather than as corn syrup and hydrogenated soybean oil? Because thats what is being grown, and frankly I wouldnt want to live of his food products."
environment,3dvr26,mycoborg,3,Mon Jul 20 14:00:49 2015 UTC,"Why do you dismiss commodities altogether?  That's what the majority of farming is. It's not going away, so why ignore the effects of it? I know that you have your niche, but that's not really relevant to the rest of the world. So dismissing it doesn't make a lot of sense.  Why is comparing pesticides laughable? What are the actual application rates?   How many organic farms actually practice no till? And do conventional farms not use cover crop rotation at all?  You don't have to live off of his food products. But similarly, others don't want to live off of your personal lifestyle. Which is why objective, evidence based discussions are important."
environment,3dvr26,Iconoclast674,2,Mon Jul 20 14:10:20 2015 UTC,"I always find it funny when people suggest/imply that we shouldn't be producing grains, when they are the staple crops that humanity has survived off of for thousands of years.  While I completely agree that a balanced diet (fruits and vegetables, meat/protein, dairy, and grains) is important, there are a few important things about grains to consider/remember (which are a big part of the reason why mankind has relied on them for so long):   What other food can be stored for years at a time, without chemical preservatives? On our own farm, we have stored grain for up to three years in our granaries waiting for better prices.  As tasty as organic vegetables might be, this isn't possible with them.  Being able to store food long term is important as more erratic weather may make production of food less stable in the future. Related to the first point, they can (relatively) easily be transported around the world.  Canada is a grain exporter.  Lots of the grain we produce ends up all over the world (canola to Japan, wheat to Europe and the middle east, oats to the United States).  Again, if weather patterns become more erratic, it will be important to be able to move large quantities of food from areas with an abundance to areas without enough."

Our growing season is very short - some years a late frost in May will damage our crops as they are emerging, while in other years an early frost in September will damage them before they have fully matured.  Growing a cover crop (with the goal of plowing it under as green manure) essentially means that a growing season has to be skipped (ie: no crop is harvested that year).  There are some organic grain producers who use them, which effectively lowers their already low yields (ie: they may only harvesting a crop every second year, or every two out of three years)."

Neonics are harmful to bees; what isn't clear is how harmful they are in field applications. It's a pesticide that kills insects that consume it; but as with anything dosage is the key. What is not known with certainty is if neonics have an effect in the field.  It has been documented that the dust blowoff generated during planting neonic treated seeds can pose an acute risk for bees. Efforts have been made to replace the talc lubricant with alternative that generates less blow off and it remains to be seen how effective it will be.  TL;DR: Despite how the article presents things, it is far from clear what impact neonics are having on bees and other pollinators."

environment,3dqjal,bacondavis,2,Sat Jul 18 20:38:13 2015 UTC,Most evidence I've seen suggests the monarch is threatened by habitat (milkweed) loss; this is partly from increased herbicide use with herbicide resistant strains.   In general there is significantly less information available for butterflies; likely a reflection of a lack of comparable industry based around them as there is with bees/honey.

Oil companies including BP and Shell recognized this early on and entered the solar industry when it was still in its relative infancy. These companies invested heavily in vertically integrated solar companies that were at one point among the largest in the world. But neither BP nor Shell was successful, and they both decided to exit the solar market. This stands as a paradox since such companies have the funds, the long-term perspectives, the management systems, the multinational presence and the lobbying clout to potentially succeed in this new energy industry. Why were they not successful, and why did they ultimately exit? This paper uses innovation theory to explore the reasons why large incumbent corporations typically fail to succeed in commercializing disruptive innovations at scale. Evidence from semi-structured interviews and discussions with former employees of BP Solar and Shell Solar confirm the explanatory power of key constructs from innovation theory in accounting for the big oil companies' experience with solar technology. Ultimately, the findings suggest that oil companies would have done better to treat their solar businesses as separate stand-alone entities.

While I would prefer to refrain from the cliche that we are a cancer, one could very well see them as symptoms of a kind of disease. There's a system in place, that needs to grow, requires constant consumption in order to keep running, and it must keep on running. It is structured in a way that we can't just get rid of it.  It is possible to make changes, but again, somethings are structured or institutionalized in a way that makes it hard to do. Imagine it sort of as the evolution of an animal, which tends to develop on top of the existing structure and while it can change and remove some features, it can't simply remove the whole structure. In the same way it is hard to change our own system. I think we have swapped a low risk society for a high risk society, in which the low risk society was susceptible to more stress all the time, but the high risk is insusceptible to stress, and rather builds up the stress and with it risk of failure. Can we change our structure in order to relieve that stress, or is our current system a evolutionary dead-end?   I see the higher complexity as a risk, in the same way that the large dinosaur worked in a stable environment, but when the environment quickly changed, the higher complexity of the large dinosaur made it harder to cope with the changes in the environment. Something of simpler complexity seems to be much more adaptable, unless the environment is kept stable, in which the higher complexity should not be a problem."

Which is an idea with merit. But it's absurd to think that that means the wealthy can't ever spend money on things that won't bring them more income.  For one thing, note that Brad Pitt/Leo Dicaprio made his ridiculous sum of money from being an entertainer and a good actor, not from building a business empire from the ground up. It's a different skill set and personality, and being stingy isn't necessary when you're paid cuckoo bucks for a few months of acting.    Then you have to consider the sheer magnitude of the money. He could simultaneously develop a heroin, gambling, and online shopping addiction and as long as he could keep making movies occasionally he would easily stay in the 1%.  Not to mention that these mega wealthy people have diverse investments managed by teams of world class accountants. While that money is sitting there, it's constantly becoming more money.   Finally, and perhaps most importantly, wealthy people are still people. They have interests, beliefs, and passions, just like anybody else. They can be batshit crazy like the celebs that support the anti-vax or AIDS denial causes.

People in the 1% make $300,000 - $500,000 a year. That's what a seasoned doctor  might make, not really that outrageous.   All these posts about the 1% are driving me nuts, because a lot of the 1% are just average americans who went to professional schools and have worked a very long time or in a relatively high paying profession. They are NOT the mega millionaires with 100M dollar fortunes like DiCaprio (who has an estimated 235M). They probably don't even have 10M fortunes or 5M ones. They are highly paid, yes, but they aren't the people anyone of us should be complaining about. The 1% are making their wages off paychecks and not investments or large inheritances.

It cost about $200,000 to build (definitely not free), and it's about 1000 square feet of space (like a big 1 bedroom or small 2 bedroom apartment, very small for a house).   For every £100 spent on electricity used, it should be able to generate £175 in electricity exports   This is the good part - in USD, that's $156 spent on electricity and $275 on electricity exports.  I'm assuming those are their monthly estimates for electricity used and generated, so at $119 profit a month, it'll only take you 140 years to pay for the house.  EDIT:  To look at it from another angle - you could buy a 1000 sq. ft. condo or apartment (which would have decent energy efficiency) in a lot of places for $110,000, and pay out $119 a month for electricity.  Assuming all other costs are roughly the same, after 30 years:  The condo cost you $152,840.  The energy positive house cost you $157,160.  Now, energy costs are going to do nothing but go up, so I'm guessing the energy positive house will start to win out well before 30 years.

No shit, Sherlock, but when you simplify it to ""Citizens near fracking have higher rates of this and that"" it's a sensational headline.  The article alludes to no attempt on behalf of the researches to carefully identify counties with similar demographics to those where fracking takes place as their control group."
environment,3dhpa6,repptar92,4,Thu Jul 16 12:27:41 2015 UTC,"but let's look at this as an example of how studies can be created to manipulate opinions:   No, this is an example of how science articles can be inadequate. I would be really surprised if the authors of this study didn't know how to control for socioeconomic factors, since this kind of correlation/causation issue is something everyone learns in Stats 101.  The actual study is here. I'm not super science-literate, so I can't really parse the statistical language very well, but they do describe how increases in wells result in hospitalizations. If the increased hospitalizations were merely a function of socioeconomic conditions, then you wouldn't expect to see hospitalizations increase if the drilling increased. To me, that suggests that there is a causal relationship between drilling and hospitalizations that doesn't have anything to do with socioeconomic status."
environment,3dhpa6,davy_crockett,3,Thu Jul 16 14:54:58 2015 UTC,"Excellent find! You're absolutely correct that the study accounts for what /u/repptar92 was worried about:   Accordingly, we used conditional fixed effects Poisson regression, where the fixed effects are the zip codes. This controls for all possible characteristics of the zip codes, both measured and unmeasured, that did not change during the period of observation. Thus, if zip codes that consistently have high rates of inpatient prevalence rates are more likely to have more wells over time, this will be accounted for in the model. Alternatively, if there are zip code-level changes from 2007–2011 that affect the number of wells and inpatient prevalence rates, this model will not account for this. Essentially, our methodology captures the association between and within zip code changes in wells and inpatient prevalence rates.   However, we should note that they looked at 26 different medical conditions and only one of them (cardiology) showed statistically significant correlation to increases in number of wells (that is to say, they are confident that this study showed increasing wells in a county increased the rate of heart attacks). The relative risk was 1.0007 per well (not sure if that's per well per square km or per well per zip code), with the average number of wells per square km at 4.28 and what looks like about 50 wells in the average zip code. So that's 0.07% greater chance of someone having a heart attack if they're in an area with an extra well. They also did some quartile groupings and statistical analysis on those, but I'm not sure I agree with their conclusions about that grouping and analysis indicating a positive correlation between neurological problems and fracking wells.  Like most studies on fracking, I think we're seeing very small relative risks compared to the medical problems caused by reckless industrial behavior of yesteryear. It warrants further study to be sure, but I fear that the ""fracking causes heart attacks!"" headline will miss the relatively minor overall risk it's causing. Live next to a fracking operation? Once a month swap a burger for a salad and then go for a run, and you're better off than you were. Note that I'm generally a fan of fracking and the regulations governing fracking, though I think government needs to do a better job and enforcing and punishing. I tried to read the study by putting those opinions aside, but I'm not sure I was able to.  Edit: fixing incorrect terminology. Said county, meant zip code in two places."

On environmental impact   Environmental impact studies are predominant in the body of GM research, making up 68% of the 1,783 studies. These studies investigated environmental impact on the crop-level, farm-level and landscape-level.The researchers found “little to no evidence” that GM crops have a negative environmental impact on their surroundings.   On yields and pesticide use    GM technology adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37%. GM technology increased crop yields by 22%. GM technology increased farmer profits by 68%. Yield gains and pesticide reductions are larger for insect-resistant crops than for herbicide-tolerant crops. Yield and profit gains are higher in developing countries than in developed countries.    This last point is interesting, particularly because GMOs get criticized for causing too much pesticide use. In fact, it's organic agriculture that often results in farmers using more pesticide because organic pesticides are usually less effective, though not necessarily less harmful."

Prices have gone up but its not breaking the bank for most, and those with problems paying are getting it covered by the state. Finally between state incentives to install high energy windows and solar rebates most people are upgrading or have already done so.

I'm sure the silence on this matter is due in no small part to the money and influence of animal agriculture.  But this is the kind of information that we, as environmentalists, need to do our best to spread. I don't think it's pragmatic to try and convert everyone to veganism, however.  That simply won't happen until the price and availability of meat becomes such that it can't be purchased by the average American.

And, now many egg companies can't sell their eggs in California because of this rule.

environment,3dftxu,gogge,8,Thu Jul 16 06:27:00 2015 UTC,"I'll just comment on the first part regarding GHG emissions.  Some of the numbers in that video seem terrifying because they're made up, the whole video is basically based on the ""51% of global GHG emissions from livestock"" number which is wrong. The issues in the video are also not really a problem with meat; you can produce it in better ways that reduces the environmental impact, the issues highlighted is mainly problems with bad agricultural practices (which have perfectly valid solutions that aren't ""stop eating meat"").  As an example that ""far more thorough"" 2009 World Watch study that quotes 51% of GHG as coming from livestock literally conjures up emissions from nothing; they add livestock breathing as CO2 emissions. The FAO report explains why this isn't an actual issue, the cows eat plant matter that has soaked up CO2, the cows exhale CO2 (a bit less than the plant matter contained), plant matter soaks it up again, repeat, it's a cycle with a slight bit of CO2 storage:   Respiration by livestock is not a net source of CO 2 …. Emissions from livestock respiration are part of a rapidly cycling biological system, where the plant matter consumed was itself created through the conversion of atmospheric CO 2 into organic compounds. Since the emitted and absorbed quantities are considered to be equivalent, livestock respiration is not considered to be a net source under the Kyoto Protocol.   The paper acknowledges this, the quoted part above is from the paper itself, and then they just hand wave it away by comparing it to using oil/gas to fuel cars.    More to the point, livestock (like automobiles) are a human invention and convenience, not part of pre-human times, and a molecule of CO 2 exhaled by livestock is no more natural than one from an auto tailpipe.   Using oil isn't a part of the same cycling system as plant matter, the oil has been removed from the cycle. This plant matter/cow cycle has been looked at by experts and researcher and the conclusion is that it's not a contributor, if anything it leads to a slight sequestration (storing of CO2). The paper is bad, the video shouldn't use it as a source, that video uses it as a central piece just means more or less the whole video is wrong.  A newer 2013 FAO study also shows that the global trend livestock GHG emissions are decreasing (both as a percent of total and in absolute totals):   With emissions estimated at 7.1 gigatonnes CO2 eq per annum, representing 14.5 percent of human-induced GHG emissions, the livestock sector plays an important role in climate change.   Gerber, P.J. et al, ""Tackling climate change through livestock – A global assessment of emissions and mitigation opportunities"". Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Rome, 2013  And if you look at individual countries, that doesn't burn rain forest for example, the impact goes even lower. US example:  Figure 6-1   In 2012, emission sources accounted for in the Agricultural chapters were responsible for 8.1 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.   Environmental Protection Agency, ""Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Agriculture"".  The 2015 draft also shows that this is declining as a percentage, 7.6% (chapter 5).  This is all US agriculture, including crops grown for human consumption. What all this means is that the problem isn't meat consumption per se, it's the way the meat is produced in some countries (e.g agricultural practices like slash-and-burn).  And even if you think that 8%, or rather 5-6% as that number includes crops that humans eat, is too high you can easily bring that number down to ""vegetarian levels"" by just reducing beef consumption. Switching to pork/chicken/fish/eggs will have the same impact as switching to a vegetarian alternative like Quorn. Relying more on pork/chicken will be a much easier transition than everyone not eating meat.  When you look at the individual common meats and protein sources produced with decent practices (Cederberg, 2013) you also see that it's only beef that's an outlier, I'll include Quorn as a vegetarian protein reference (Quorn, 2014):  Figure 5.    Food kg CO2 eq/kg    Beef 25   Pork 6   Quorn 4   Chicken 3   Fish 3   Eggs 1.5    Bone free percentages used; beef 78%, pork 62%, chicken 76% as the numbers in Cederberg is with bone. Example: 19.6 kg CO2/kg for beef, divided by 0.78, is 25.2 and rounded to 25.  Edit: Replaced ""grass"" with ""plant matter"" for clarification."

Large scale farming, e.g CAFOs, for beef is sadly slightly less bad when it comes to GHG emissions (Avery, 2008) as the problem with ruminants is the way they digest plant matter. When you do intensive feeding with antibiotics you have high energy density plant matter and less bacterial fermentation which makes the cattle grow faster, a lower total life span for the cattle means they emit less greenhouse gasses and thus we get more ""environmentally friendly"" meat.

I meant ""transition"" as in people just replacing beef, when you get to the point where people don't eat beef you've reduced GHG emissions by about 70% and there's no meaningful benefit in reducing it even further (we're talking trying to influence perhaps 1-2% of total GHG emissions). And just going vegan at that point doesn't mean that you reduce GHG emissions if the things you eat has been shipped across the world and/or processed in factories. As shown above Quorn is worse than chicken, and even things like mashed potatoes end up at 3-4 kg CO2 eq/kg:  Figure 3  Moudrý Jr. J, et al. ""Assessing greenhouse gas emissions from potato production and processing in the Czech Republic"" Outlook on Agriculture, Volume 42, Number 3, September 2013, pp. 179-183(5)  To really influence things at this point people will have to minimize eating processed food, try to source things more locally, and in general optimize nutrients in regards to which vegetables they eat as some of them are quite bad on a ""CO2 equivalent per calorie"" basis.  The effort required isn't worth the gains when you look at what else we can improve in regards to GHG emissions."

Let's take the concrete example of misleading with statistics in that she's looking at the absolute difference in water savings from removing non-vegan products from a diet without substituting them for another kind of food rather than the nominal difference in savings that you would get from substituting vegetarian products for meat.  Claims about just taking meat away are misleading to innumerate people, because a person who eats a normal amount of calories can't simply remove calories from their diet; they have to substitute lost calories with something else containing protein, like beans or whey isolate, which require resources to produce. If a person removed eggs from their diet but replaced it with something unusually scarce and resource-costly to make, it might not be eco-friendly, whereas beans are probably more eco-friendly, but we don't completely know, since she didn't say how many gallons of water it takes to produce beans.   I'll ignore the problem that water consumption in normal non-drought afflicted places would have to be considered in terms of carbon/energy cost, because the water is often ultimately recycled back into the environment, since I do work with statistics but not water reservoirs for a living.  It turns out that one example I picked at random is actually much worse, since the ""source"" she cited itself is...... dubious, to say the least 35."
environment,3dftxu,AU___NATUREL,-12,Thu Jul 16 16:09:08 2015 UTC,"This is all nice and well, but there are still serious nutritional concerns with vegan diets. While removing meat and dairy altogether would be a laudable goal, we already know that the average American diet includes far too much meat and dairy. We could still see some major improvements if most Americans simply slashed their meat and dairy consumption to 10% or 20% of what it currently is.  As for sustainability, what's so wrong with aquaculture if done responsibly? Tilapia seems to thrive in freshwater aquaculture, and when grown concurrently with plants, the plants serve to filter the water (as seen in wild ponds in nature). The only question becomes how to most effectively scale such an operation up to meet demand without throwing the whole system out of balance and causing pollution."
environment,3dftxu,Crayz9000,13,Wed Jul 15 23:39:15 2015 UTC,"That article you linked actually praises the benefits of a vegan diet. It recommends eating more whole foods (dark leafy vegetables, legumes, ground flax seeds) to ensure we adequately meet our calcium, zinc, omega-3 needs and getting enough sunshine. The only nutrient that needs supplementation is B12, which is acceptable given all the other benefits in CVD, diabetes etc.  Veganism is really an ethical choice, not an environmental one. But the environmental reasons for eating a plant based diet are very compelling. The point of video was to outline that a lot of environmentalists and environmental groups are missing the number 1 (by a lot) multi faceted contributing factor to climate change.  There are lots of problems with aqua culture. But assuming it's the perfect solution and can be scalable to meet global demand, and any other idea you have for that matter what should we do till then? If we are concerned about the environment we can't wait around for aquaculture or whatever other silver bullet solution to be available at our local restaurants and markets, we have a really good solution already lets use that."
environment,3dftxu,Mopstorte,-4,Thu Jul 16 01:28:55 2015 UTC,"Again, I understand the health benefits of eating more whole foods and vegetables. But crusading to eliminate meat from the American diet altogether is counterproductive - people don't like making radical changes. Gradual changes, on the other hand, are far easier to accept, and a large percentage of Americans aren't really going to give a damn about the ethics of meat but the health benefits of eating less meat is a much more convincing argument.  So start ratcheting down the amounts of meat we eat. Smaller portions, less wasteful meats (cows obviously being the worst offenders on an efficiency/lb basis). Look at many European diets - meats are generally a small portion of most dishes. If it's the flavor of the meat you're after, you can make a pound of it go pretty far.  I'm also not saying aquaculture is a perfect solution, but it is at least scalable (as seen in China, although their safety practices leaves much to be desired) and is one way we can help wean off our dependency on the oceans. Particularly since developing countries that are heavily dependent on seafood for their dietary needs will strongly resent being told to ""stop fishing"" by the first world."

There is a need for more studies on the relation between vegan diets and risk of cancer, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Vitamin B-12 deficiency is a potential problem for vegans, so that the use of vitamin B-12–fortified foods or supplements are essential. To optimize the n–3 fatty acid status of vegans, foods rich in ALA, DHA-fortified foods, or DHA supplements should be regularly consumed. Vegans generally have an adequate iron intake and do not experience anemia more frequently than others. Typically, vegans can avoid nutritional problems if appropriate food choices are made. Their health status appears to be at least as good as other vegetarians, such as lactoovovegetarians. (Other articles in this supplement to the Journal include references 83–109.)

I am only questioning how realistic it is to expect any statistically significant percentage of the population to accept a vegan lifestyle. Sure, you can have a balanced vegan diet -- if you remember to eat fortified foods and take supplements. You can also dramatically cut your carbon and water footprints if you simply reduce the amount of meat you eat by a large fraction and choose meats that have smaller footprints.  For instance, think about all the talk of carbon taxes and how effective it's proven to be in New England. Now imagine the results if we treated livestock agriculture the same way. The price of meat would rise, and people would figure out ways to get by with less meat. Land devoted to animal agriculture would drop with demand..."

Now, granted, there's no smoking gun in sense of R.J. Reynolds' internal memos and suppressed studies, but as the campaign against factory farming has shown, the issue still resonates at least partially with the general public.  All I'm saying is that, given that studies have shown animal agriculture accounts for over 8% of GHG emissions, and possibly more (although as /u/gogge pointed out the 51% claim is a bit far-fetched) it should be treated as a GHG source under any sort of cap-and-trade or carbon tax system.   People will vote with their wallets, and if chicken and turkey are significantly more cost-effective than beef due to carbon taxes (they already are, on a per-pound basis, but the difference in price is usually only 1.5-2x at present) I suspect we'll see even more of a switch away from beef.  It's not going to stop the American obsession with hamburgers and fast food, however, but it might encourage said fast food places to slim down their portions to stay competitive - fewer, smaller patties etc - or slowly replace expensive beef menu items with more chicken and turkey. Which is rather overdue if you think about it, since the average size of a hamburger back in the 1950s when the craze began was smaller than a McDonald's quarter-pounder, but today third-pound and half-pound double and triple burgers are more popular than ever."

You haven't really explained what you mean by maladaptive.  To your second point about costs... Food is less expensive today than it has ever been - that's why so much of the world spends such a small percentage of income on food.

If new genetically engineered forms of corn and soybeans tolerant of 2,4-D are approved, the volume of 2,4-D sprayed could drive herbicide usage upward by another approximate 50%.

In this  first link...the author dismissed the benbrook study, not by citing facts or rebutting specifics but rather by offering up 3 external links...  The 1st by Keith Kloor who said the media misplayed the study. Kloor doesnt refute the findings but takes issue with how the media presented it. Moving on....  The 2nd is from Steve Savage who also did not refute the premise of Benbrooks study and even stated the following: Chuck Benbrook, is certainly qualified to consider pesticide issues (obviously this former UC Davis scientist holds a higher opinion than some random redditor, who would have thought). Savage then goes on to take a positive perspective on the increase of herbicide use while never disputing the increase use of pesticides.  3rd, the GLP author cites the ""Big Picture Agriculture Blog"" as breaking down the study. The link to the blogs criticism is however not there so that becomes a dead end, besides, its a blog and we know how you GMO activists love to hammer people who cite blogs.  Now for the second link lol, its the same article just published on a different site. Same exact write up from the GLP, same author, verbatim. See above for my thoughts.  The third link, the author Andrew Kniss, who is actually pretty fair on the issue, recanted a bit on his rebuttal, admitting that his original criticism of the study (lack of sufficient data to make the claims Benbrook did) didnt take into account that the USDA-NASS is not the only source of pesticide use data and further admits that ""while the data have similar (or possibly better) accuracy compared to government statistics, they will cost money to obtain"".

To find land necessary, 9.1 x 1012 kg / (5.8 x 104 kg/acre) = 1.6 x 106 acre = 250,000 mile2, which is a little less than the size of Texas.

environment,3d9dj4,ILikeNeurons,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:40:09 2015 UTC,Amusing. Your comment claimed the economy wasn't fucked pre Reagan supported by your comment asking for a source. You either have to be completely stupid to think the economy wasn't fucked or under 20.  I simply googled economy during 70's and grabbed the first relevant article I saw.... Meaning there were 100's I could have picked and that one talking about inflation was one of them. There were many reasons the economy was fucked. You obviously need someone to hold your hand and walk you through it as if you have no idea that part of Reagan economy was to lower taxes. I dunno. Maybe you didn't know that?? So under 20? Your comment asking for a source clued me in on the fact you have no clue what you are talking about.   I don't need to source the sky is blue and gravity keeps us on earth. But maybe you do?

If you tax Gas then energy prices go up. If energy prices go up, it costs more to remove the CO2 from the air. (Because you need energy to remove the CO2.)  So then you have to increase the tax, but then energy gets even more expensive.  You can't win this way. You can only win by reducing the need for energy (which you mostly can't do), or by finding new energy sources."

No matter where the equilibrium eventually lies, it will result in a great deal less carbon in the atmosphere. This is like Econ 101 stuff; come on."
environment,3d9dj4,sapiophile,0,Wed Jul 15 05:29:41 2015 UTC,"As the price of energy goes up, it is consumed less.   It's not that simple. Energy is the core behind every single thing we do. If energy costs go up the cost of EVERYTHING goes up.  Are you thinking ""that's not so bad""? We'll consume less? The problem is that the very first thing to go when costs go up is the environment. People only have the money to care about pollution and habitats and things like that when costs are low.  So making energy expensive will cause huge harm to the environment.  Are you going to buy an expensive low pollution vehicle, or the cheap smoker? That depends on how much they cost and how much money you have, which depends on how much you are spending for things.   And there are many obvious costs to removing the CO2 from air that are completely unrelated to energy cost   There are none. Not a single one. If you think there are I challenge you to post one.   This is like Econ 101 stuff; come on.   Yah, I know. People who only think about things from a 101 point of view think ""higher prices, less energy, done and done"". But when you take higher level classes you realize things are much more complicated and what you thought will help actually harms.  Note: A CO2 tax might help in some ways, if done very very very carefully. But NOT if you try to tax things to the point of ""exactly pays the cost of removing that carbon from the air"" - that would never work, a tax that high would cause huge environment harm.  I'll elaborate: A CO2 tax that is enough to take an alternative fuel that just barely is too expensive, and make it competitive, would work. This alternative fuel must have wide availability with the only barrier to use cost. And the cost difference must be low.  Anything more than that will cause more harm than help."

People only have the money to care about pollution and habitats and things like that when costs are low.   What an absurd argument. Yes, you are correct - people (and industry) look to externalize more costs when the cost of energy goes up, but there is absolutely zero basis to claim that that will somehow exceed the emissions that are otherwise offset - or even come close to parity with those emissions.  But don't take my word for it - there is no shortage of data to prove this. For instance, let's look at the countries around the world with the highest fuel prices - at the top of that list we see nations like Norway, Turkey, the Netherlands, Italy, France, Sweden... These are not exactly places that have some enormous problem with unconventional emissions. The economy simply encourages them to use less fossil fuels, and - gasp! - that's almost certainly what they do.   Are you going to buy an expensive low pollution vehicle, or the cheap smoker?   When fuel costs go up, the market has an immediate and marked shift towards more fuel-efficient vehicles. This has been demonstrated and reported on, and is not controversial. And of course plenty of folks can just start to find it more economical to take the bus, instead, which is another win for emissions.    And there are many obvious costs to removing the CO2 from air that are completely unrelated to energy cost     There are none. Not a single one. If you think there are I challenge you to post one.   Uhhh... wat. How about paying the workers at the CO2-capture plants? Or maybe constructing them? Or the cost of the software they run? Or practically anything involved in their operation except the actual energy they consume?  Now if you're actually smart, maybe at this point you'll say, ""but all of those costs go up when the cost of energy goes up, too!"" And about that, you're 100% correct - except for one very important thing: they don't go up with full parity - the market has a fair bit of ""give"" and the increased cost of living from an increased cost of energy doesn't immediately translate into higher wages, for instance. If what you were saying were true, then in 2005 when fuel prices practically doubled in the U.S., the cost of virtually every product and service on the market would have doubled, as well - and wages too, of course. I don't think I need to cite a source to demonstrate how that most definitely did not happen - and does not happen even in the long term.  What you are saying is basically so illogical, and so preposterous, that it could only be the product of the most sickening, delusional kind of zealotry. The fact that you claim that it's based on some greater understanding of economics - despite your figures and premises being completely artificial and without merit of any kind - really puts a shine on this steaming load of poop.  Either make some actual sense, or stay out of the debate - nobody needs this kind of disingenuous ignorance shoved in the middle of a terrifically important dilemma."
environment,3d9dj4,sapiophile,-1,Wed Jul 15 06:12:33 2015 UTC,"For instance, let's look at the countries around the world with the highest fuel prices   You are confusing gasoline with energy.

I suspected you would say that. People don't realize how core energy is to every single economic thing.  Why do you have to pay workers? So they can buy energy to run their daily lives.  What is the main cost of construction? Energy. Energy to mine the raw materials, refine them, manufacture them, ship them, etc etc.  What is the cost of software?

environment,3d9dj4,asr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:01:08 2015 UTC,"Are you actually being serious right now? Really? And you say you have more knowledge about economics than the other side of this debate? Fascinating.  Let's take this one step at a time:   You are confusing gasoline with energy. They don't have high energy prices, just high gasoline prices.   And we're also not talking about an ""energy"" tax, either - we're talking about taxing energy only in proportion to its atmospheric carbon contribution. That means coal and gasoline/diesel/heating oil, primarily. So what would be the result of such a tax? Why, other sources of energy, like wind and solar, would become more competitively priced (relatively) and grow their market share - at a much lower cost per watt-hour than the alternatives.  Tell me - how, exactly, would it work for a region with such a tax to suddenly start producing greater carbon emissions? Because you haven't actually explained that.   People don't realize how core energy is to every single economic thing.    Why do you have to pay workers? So they can buy energy to run their daily lives.    What is the main cost of construction? Energy. Energy to mine the raw materials, refine them, manufacture them, ship them, etc etc.    What is the cost of software? People, same as paying the workers.   So, you seem to have conveniently ignored precisely the part of my comment (and the basic economic theory) that refutes this flat out. Academically, it's called elasticity. The ripples emanating from a change in the price of a good - even a central good like energy - don't spread out across the entire economy with 100% parity ad infinitum. The further removed from the direct cost - or the greater the availability of alternatives - the less of an effect such a price increase has on a given industry, product or service.  But here's another chunk of food for thought for you about this, from an entirely different angle:  This is a simple office chair that costs about $2,000.  This is a fundamentally similar office chair that costs only $59 - about thirty-four times less expensive than the one above.  Now, tell me - did the $2,000 chair utilize thirty-four times the amount of energy in its production as its cheaper cousin? Or, maybe - not to be too radical here or anything - is there perhaps not exactly 1:1 parity between price and energy cost? Or is it somehow just ""energies all the way down"" regarding the price of the designer chair? If so, do explain, I'm sure it must be a fascinating journey - but if so, please do show your work.   That's why if you raise the cost of energy you raise the cost of everything.   Yes, you most certainly do, and I've already agreed with that. The issue is that you don't raise the cost of everything by the same amount, across the board. See ""elasticity,"" above.   And this is why I fear for the results of environmentalism. There is so much ignorance washed in a shine of falsehoods that make people think they are doing good, while actually doing bad.   And this is why I fear for the results of laissez-faire capitalist zealotry. There is so much ignorance washed in a shine of falsehoods that make people think they are doing good, while actually just spouting false talking points developed by lobbyists and billionaires.

environment,3d9dj4,4ray,0,Wed Jul 15 09:26:55 2015 UTC,"So what would be the result of such a tax? Why, other sources of energy, like wind and solar, would become more competitively priced (relatively) and grow their market share   Sigh. Stop imagining you know everything and try learning something. Do you think wind and solar just magically spring from the ground? You need energy to make them, LOTS of energy. A CO2 tax would raise energy prices, so those devices would become more expensive. The increase in cost would be enough to offset much of the CO2 tax. (i.e. now both energy sources are more expensive).  How much would be the offset? That's the magic question, it's probably not 100%, but don't imagine it's negligible either. So a CO2 tax is not a magic wand the fixes everything - it causes huge disruption, because in addition to energy being more expensive EVERYTHING is more expensive. You essentially created huge monetary inflation, and that would be a disaster.  And ESPECIALLY because we can not at the moment produce enough alternate devices to make enough energy, so you increase demand, without increasing supply.  That's why I said, a slow careful approach, you never want to tax enough to cause demand to outstrip supply.   Tell me - how, exactly, would it work for a region with such a tax to suddenly start producing greater carbon emissions? Because you haven't actually explained that.   First of all we are talking about a tax sufficient to remove all CO2 from the air, not a small CO2 tax.  The greater carbon emission happen because now you have to run a machine to remove CO2 from the air, and that is an energy intensive process. So your new activity ended up causing an increase in energy usage.  And since most energy today comes from CO2 producing sources you end up emitting more CO2 than you started with.  You simply can NOT fix things this way. Which is what I started with: You need to fix things on the energy supply side, with new energy sources. You can not tax your way out of this, it just won't work.   ....don't spread out across the entire economy....   They do spread, there is just a time delay. And you risk killing entire industries with that time delay. And imagine costs go up with a shorter time delay than wages (which is the case), so you are also hurting many many people.   Now, tell me - did the $2,000 chair utilize thirty-four times the amount of energy in its production as its cheaper cousin?   Sort of. Where does that extra money go? Usually it goes to advertising, and to large wages, also some profit. All of those activities consume energy. It should be obvious that a very rich person (either profit or wages) uses more energy than a regular person.   while actually just spouting false talking points developed by lobbyists and billionaires. ..... Now stop wasting my time, and get back to licking your boss's boots.   Maybe you learned something new. Or maybe you choose to ignore it, probably the latter given that you choose to end with rather insipid insults. But maybe not, given that you at least made some intelligent replies at the top.  Unlike some environmentalists I use science to guide my actions, not emotions. I reject all environmental ideas that make people feel good without actually doing any good. (For example locavores, or glass recycling.) From reading this sub it's quite clear that most environmentalists only care about feeling like that did something. Actually doing anything is a distant second.  Just to go offtrack for a moment here is an example of that (from the article):   But Carbon Engineering would like to be able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, and then combine the hydrogen with CO2 to make a diesel fuel that could power local buses or be exported to California, which subsidizes low-carbon fuels.   Have you ever heard of a stupider idea? Ever? Why not just use the primary energy directly instead of double-converting it, with the resultant efficiency losses? I'll tell you why! It's because California pays them to greenwash fuel. It's a perfect plan - burn some coal, and use that to make a low-carbon fuel to ship to California.  I really wish people would stop being so STUPID about the environment. I have so many more examples of this kind of stupid thinking.  Here's another one, just for fun: BMW uses hydroelectric power to run electric heaters to make carbon fiber. Why? So they can pretend they are helping the environment. What they should do instead of using electricity for heat, is use that same hydroelectric power to send electricity to houses, and burn some gas for heat. Hydroelectric power is always used at max, there is never any extra - if BMW takes some for heat, it means someone else has to burn gas for electricity. But burning gas for electricity is less efficient than burning gas for heat.  So thanks BMW! You have harmed the environment while pretending to help it."

It's these kind of fictional ""fixes"" that are going to doom any effort to actually make things better.

environment,3d9dj4,10thflrinsanity,9,Tue Jul 14 17:07:06 2015 UTC,"TL/DR: the shortcomings in our approach to environmental problems are larger than merely the inadequacy of capitalism. We will need to harness the power of religious (or, if you prefer, ""a-rational"") fanaticism to preserve and heal our ecosystem and save our species.  This is the problem.  This has been the problem since environmental activists started confronting these issues in the 1970s: fixing environmental problems is a cost.  Why?  Because the ""science"" of economics treats nature as an ""externality"": the problem is built into the very intellectual ""grammar"" and ""syntax"" of how we even conceive of ""economic productivity"" and nature.  I remember debating economist Bill Nordhaus 25 years ago along these lines: environmentalism and business were ""religions,"" he claimed, while his beloved field of economics was a ""science"".  I countered that all three modes of thought were ""religious,"" in the sense of ultimately relying on unprovable assumptions -- and that therefore economics could not claim some kind of intellectual superiority over environmentalism.    And my real point was, the worth of any mode of thought lies in the results it produces in the world around us.  That said, I would offer for consideration that the growing ecological catastrophe unfolding around us like a slow-motion car crash goes beyond ""capitalism,"" which I think makes an easy scapegoat simply because it has become the ascendant economic system.  I mean, consider what industrial communism looked like.  Have you ever seen photos of some of those Soviet mining sites?  No, this is not really about capitalism.  It's bigger.  Thomas Merton, the Catholic monk and activist, once said that the world's problems were deeper than mere politics, which is why he eventually became a monk: he believed the solutions to our problems lay in the spiritual realm.  And I agree.  Imagine a world in which every human society, or at least a critical mass of them, attacked the problems of ecological sustainability with the same ""religious fervor"" we currently reserve for, say, ""the war on terror.""  Or ""the war on drugs.""  We would stop being overly concerned about ""costs,"" and simply focus our social energy on our objective.  I believe only an ""eco-jihad"" will save the species, because economics as a mode of human thought is simply woefully inadequate to the task before us.    Hoping that economics will lead us out of our environmental crisis is like hoping we can capture the grandeur and genius of Mozart's Requiem by playing it on a single kazoo."

You happen to have three things in the back of your truck - a bilge pump, a mop and bucket, and a sponge.  Would you explore all three options at the same time?  No, you'd fire up the pump to clear out as much water as possible, and then switch to the mop to get the few remaining puddles.  Right now we're at the flood stage and a sponge is only going to waste time.  But the first thing to do is to stop the water pouring in, and we have ways to do that that are much easier than taking water back out.  So we should do that first.  One example is installing ground-source heat pumps.  Even if you power it with coal, you end up burning less carbon than heating a house with a gas furnace.  It's a lot cheaper than trying to pull CO2 out of the air, concentrate it, and then split the  molecule and reform it back into coal or gas."

The decline in reproductive output is for the middle classes which have become more career driven, especially on the side of the woman.   Population is absolutely a key aspect, because it's tied to poverty. The poor in sub-saharan Africa are not low emitters because they're low emitters, they are low emitters because many are subsistence farmers, many eat very little meat, have access to little or no electricity generation/supply, and most of these people only have access to a bicycle if they have access to any transportation at all. Those that have transportation are more often than not to live in a semi-urban environment and the transportion is considerably less heavy in that motorcycles make up a greater proportion of overall vehicle use.  It's a fallacy to say they will not consume the same resources we do in the west, you only need to look at the incredible demand for meat over in East Asia that has come with economic prosperity. Sure, it'd be great if everybody switched a vegetarian diet, fossil fuel was phased out immediately, and we began a systematic reforestation effort for land that has been deforested, but that isn't going to happen.

I agree with this from your post:  ""We must grow our food organically and locally, and eat considerably less (or no) meat. We must ride our bikes more and fly less, mend our clothes, share resources, radically reduce our waste streams and creatively “retrofit the suburbs” to turn our homes and communities into places of sustainable production, not unsustainable consumption. In doing so, we must challenge ourselves to journey beyond the ecovillage movement and explore an even deeper green shade of sustainability.  Among other things, this means living lives of frugality, moderation and material sufficiency. Unpopular though it is to say, we must also have fewer children, or else our species will grow itself into a catastrophe.""  Luckily, the planet is having fewer children and population growth poses a far smaller threat then all of the things listed in the lead up to the reference to population.

In order to support 9 billion people, we would need to live lives approaching those of rural Africans. Nobody wants that kind of hardship and a transition to that, if it happens at all, will be slow and over many many decades. Not having children in the first place is one way to buy more time to make changes before support systems collapse.  Life required with 7 billion people to be sustainable barely resembles what we have now in developed countries. You're suggesting that we will be fine with 9 billion. An extra 2 billion places more strain than is necessary and population control should absolutely be a priority.   This is another good read, and it argues that climate isn't the start and stop of sustainability. Nor should any of the other issues be ignored while focusing on any one. For example, if you ignore ocean acidification, you may be celebrating net reduction in methane as a triumph of preventing climate change, but if your CO2 has increased while methane had decreased you may have made climate change easier to deal with but made ocean acidification worse.  In terms of only emissions, population isn't terribly weighted, but it's connected to biodiversity loss, pollution and food scarcity as well as climate change and ocean acidification. That means that population is weighted."

environment,3dfgv5,deck_hand,2,Wed Jul 15 22:06:08 2015 UTC,"The anticipated 60% reduction in solar magnetic-cycle magnitude translates to a climate forcing of -0.1 W/m2. That's equivalent to a decrease of 8 ppm atmospheric carbon dioxide. The atmosphere currently holds about 400 ppm CO2, with 350 ppm ultimately lethal to humans. Subtracting 8 ppm at this point is analogous to giving a blood transfusion to a dead man."

environment,3dfgv5,deck_hand,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:41:18 2015 UTC,"Logic.  If 350 ppm is ultimately lethal to humans, and we're at 400 ppm and rising, then we have passed the point where the atmospheric concentration is lethal to humans.    If we've already passed the point of lethality to humans, then, by definition, we're already doomed.  Or, did you mean something else by your statement that an atmosphere of more than 350 ppm is ultimately lethal to humans?    You also said that reducing the carbon dioxide concentration by 8 ppm, at this point is analogous to giving a transfusion to a dead man.  I read that as, ""since we're already dead (doomed) by our current level of CO2, reducing the levels by 8 ppm is useless.""    You used two ways to say that we're already past the point that we can survive the levels of CO2 that we have already experienced.  I'm guessing that you think that we're living on borrowed time, and we're just moving inexorably towards our extinction, since we had to have stopped the CO2 rise at 350 to have any chance at all.  I don't agree with you, but... pretending that changing our economic system or abandoning our use of fossil fuels at this point would do anything at all would be hypocritical of you, since we're way beyond the level of CO2 that you think we can survive.  It would be like someone who has taken a lethal dose of cyanide spending the last minutes of his life swearing that he's going to give up smoking."

At a minimum, limited liability entities must purchase insurance to cover the full potential damage that their actions could cause.  Enforcement efforts must be robust, and never compromised by fiscal stringency.  Fracking operators must pay these costs.  And enforcement agents must have incentives to stay independent, with no prospect of being captured by the regulated.  That requires total economic separation, before and after working to enforce the rule.  The assessment of adverse impacts should be an ongoing function, leading to periodic updating of the regulations.  For all these reasons, the kind of regulatory protections supported by Nocera are a mirage.  They would probe to be an inadequate defense of public health and the environment."

This is not a chart of CO2 released per KWH produced... that's the second chart, where Duke, Southern, TVA and such do not appear.  No where in the article could I find why having a lot of customers was considered worse than having a high CO2 to KWH produced.  Why are the large companies ""worst"" because they are large, instead of actually showing their relative efficiency?   Is it possibly propaganda, meant to show companies like Duke in the worst light possible?  Duke, for example, did not rank #1 (worst) in the emissions rate, it ranked 56.  More than half of the top 100 companies performed worse than Duke at producing CO2 emissions per kilowatt-hour produced.  I personally would count that as encouraging, given that it's the largest producer of electricity.    The chart they should have been showing is the one on page 23 of the report, showing the rankings of the power companies that produce the most emissions per kilowatt hour of energy.  Duke is no where near the top of that list.  Neither is the Southern Company (rank #52)."

Economics is a divisive subject that arguably has more philosophy than mathematics.   Economists can make bold claims that fly in the face of history, and are lauded for it (e.g. Laffer). When scientists make bold claims, they're greeted with skepticism until proven or disproven, at which point they might win a Nobel prize if right, or be laughed out of the room if wrong (e.g. Pons and Fleischmann, or Seralini)."

environment,3da3v6,dtiftw,5,Tue Jul 14 18:17:55 2015 UTC,"First, we were said to be “against science.” Our adversaries invoked consensus among economists in favor of these methods, a serious fallacy.    Actually, no, anybody who isn't an top-level expert should accept the consensus as the best option, and the consensus is set by all the top-level experts.     Second, we are told that a modified tomato is not different from a naturally occurring tomato. That is wrong: The statistical mechanism by which a tomato was built by nature is bottom-up, by tinkering in small steps (as with the restaurant business, distinct from contagion-prone banks). In nature, errors stay confined and, critically, isolated.   What? The differences between non-GMO varieties of a single species can be much greater than the differences between a GMO and a non-GMO variety of the same species.     Third, the technological salvation argument we faced in finance is also present with G.M.O.s, which are intended to “save children by providing them with vitamin-enriched rice.” The argument’s flaw is obvious: In a complex system, we do not know the causal chain, and it is better to solve a problem by the simplest method, and one that is unlikely to cause a bigger problem.   Golden rice is the simpler argument that is unlikely to cause a bigger problem.   Fourth, by leading to monoculture — which is the same in finance, where all risks became systemic — G.M.O.s threaten more than they can potentially help.    GMOs do not reduce biodiversity when properly following guidelines.  In fact this ""review  finds that currently commercialized GM crops have reduced the impacts of agriculture on biodiversity"".   Fifth, and what is most worrisome, is that the risk of G.M.O.s are more severe than those of finance. They can lead to complex chains of unpredictable changes in the ecosystem, while the methods of risk management with G.M.O.s — unlike finance, where some effort was made — are not even primitive.   So you mean like any new variety, non-GMO or GMO. You're right, let's just quit farming, guys."

On 20 March, a panel of international experts convened by the agency reported the findings of a review of five agricultural chemicals in a class known as organophosphates. A summary of the study was published in The Lancet Oncology1. Two of the pesticides — tetrachlorvinphos and parathion — were rated as “possibly carcinogenic to humans”, or category 2B.

For instance, renewables have absolutely no toe-hold in any area other than electricity - yet humans use FAR MORE energy in non-electric forms.  No viable renewables are energy-dense - nor are any of them particularly portable.  Fossil fuels are BOTH of those things - in abundance.    We can produce all the green, non-portable energy we want - we have nuclear reactors.  What the world needs is green-energy that's portable and energy-dense (then, Teslas wouldn't need to be chock-full of batteries, and they'd go a lot further than 1 or 200 miles before needing hours to recharge).  And, just to show you how ludicrous the suggestion that we can stop using fossil fuels in 15 years really is...  To do that, you will need to replace about 1 billion cars.  But, the cheapest electric cars today are like $30 to 60 grand.  So, that's $30 to 60 TRILLION the world needs to spend - on cars (when they already have good, usable cars to begin with).

environment,3d3fw4,madazzahatter,3,Mon Jul 13 05:25:20 2015 UTC,"Environmental injury is too often handled as a civil matter rather than a criminal one.  The world relies far too heavily on the environment right now for mistakes to be made.  We need strong scrutiny on certain endeavors where we are all exposed to risk.  As such, we should treat the case of ""surprise"" in the case of environmental catastrophe as especially severe.  The fossil fuel companies might like to argue that the world needs energy, and that they are the path forward.  That's heavily disputed by some, but accepted by many.  The middle ground should be that we should require them to offer the risk analysis showing all risks, and fine if they want to say there are benefits.  But if a risk ever occurs that they did not plan for, that should be out on the table.  Right now, they are incentivized to look surprised,  but we should make that the worst thing that can happen.  We should say that it is outright criminal (personally, I would say ""crime against humanity"" and ""capital crime"" are not too strong), never civil, if they exposed us to a chemical or process or other hazard that we did not have prior notice about.  Every bit of their risk analysis should be on the table.    Since we can't audit it easily (usually not realizing in advance that there is something we even should audit), we should incentivize disclosure by saying that as long as the risk is properly presented to the public so that the public could have made a legitimate decision to oppose it, and so that proper public dialog occurred before the act, then events can be treated as civil matters we all bought into.  But anything for which a risk was ignored, withheld, or ineffectively researched should be something where the principals involved, certainly to include the management team but also the workers involved, may be treated criminally with very severe penalties (since the consequences to live of individuals, the community, and sometimes the world is also severe) and with no statute of limitations.  My point is that we should as sharply as possible incentivize aggressive disclosure rather than, as now, incentivizing corporate trade secret and other legal firewalls, as a way for the people involved to protect themselves personally when engaging in risky business."

environment,3d0j2f,IAmBroom,25,Mon Jul 13 03:11:19 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of an interesting fact about early Earth, some 300 million years ago during the Carboniferous period, forests proliferated but decomposing bacteria was not yet able to break down trees efficiently (more specifically, lignin in trees which is concentrated in the bark, and these ancient trees were very bark-heavy).   This led to huge amounts of carbon biomatter just hanging around, impacting the planet's atmosphere and piling up on top of itself for eons. Of course much much later this all turned into fossil fuels.  I wonder if any politicians out there are thinking about this...""so if we bomb people or lower nuclear safety standards, we can kill off some bacteria and make oil?"""

They just don't seem to permeate the substrate as well as a fungus would.

They also count things like the animals's respiration which is part of the short-term carbon cycle and not normally counted in this type of analysis.  I am an opponent of all industrialized agriculture, and especially industrialized animal agriculture with its abominable cruelty and massive pollution and insustainability.  But I think it is not helpful to distort the issues with such bizarre statistics.  The main drivers of global warming are 1) fossil fuel use, and 2) deforestation.  Yes, today a not insignificant portion of the fossil fuels and deforested land go toward animal agriculture, but if you only blame animal agriculture then it is not at all clear that reducing animal agriculture would reduce emissions all that much... those fossil fuels and deforested land will just be used differently.  To survive this century we humans will have to change our lifestyles in many ways, including diet... the quantities of meat people in the richer countries eat is neither sustainable nor particularly healthy.

His books delve into this question from an experienced and knowledgeable perspective.   Keep in mind methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. Animal waste that is concentrated into an anaerobic environment such as a CAFO will always produce beaucoup methane. Animal waste that is dispersed in a natural pattern over grassland decays aerobically and only produces a little methane, while also feeding the photosynthetic process of the pasture - a HUGE carbon sink.   So while CAFO methods are a major contributor to emissions, raising cows on pasture can actually help offset emissions elsewhere.   Theoretically, we could convert all the land in the US that grows grain for CAFOs to pastureland, and then graze that pasture rather than using CAFOs - this would mean the US beef herd, through maintaining its pasture in a natural pattern, would generate a net reduction in carbon emissions. This would require a 50% reduction in US beef consumption."

Maybe your son or daughter will be a scientists or engineer and discover a way to convert CO2 into carbon sinks in a low cost way   It's possible, but the majority of people don't have a large positive effect. It also could be argued that adopting a child might give them the opportunity to become a scientist or engineer that otherwise would have been denied to them.   Raising a child to appreciate and fight for the environment is better than not having that person around, especially if they live in a voting, democratic society   The adoption point applies here as well. However, there are no guarantees when raising a child. Plenty of children go in a direction their parents disagree with.   Said child could also convince others that the environment is important   Also applies to adoption.  So basically, all the same positive effects you describe would apply to adopting a child, except we wouldn't bringing another person into the world to use resources. We'd be taking what already exists and trying to improve it.   But it's naive to say that having a child is bad for the environment.   In general, it's going to be. Most people don't even to take many steps to decrease their impact. Even with the awareness and motivation I have, I've only mitigated my harm to some degree. I'm certainly far from actually having an overall positive effect, and I probably never will.   It's much worse for you to not live carbon neutral and not have a child, than a family of three to live carbon neutral.   You lose the ability to control what your child does once they come of age and become an adult. There's no guarantee that your child will become carbon neutral, and since most people aren't carbon neutral the overwhelming likelihood is that your child will not remain carbon neutral their whole life.  Additionally, the choice to bring your child into existence doesn't only have significance during their own lifespan, they may have children, their children may have children and so on. Potentially your decision to procreate will have consequences for thousands of years, and again since most people aren't carbon neutral (or even substantially motivated to reduce their harmful effects) probably most of your children's descendants will have an average harmful effect on the environment.   Because of those far reaching consequences, I stand by my previous assertion that procreation generally the most profound negative effect an individual can have on the environment. It's not guaranteed, but it's probably the case.   You said you have a child, so I'm sure that's not what you want to hear but I believe it to be true and all the evidence I am aware of supports this position."

I certainly hope that your case (and every case, really) is an exception, but the odds are against it.   The best things humans can do for the environment is to disappear.   Well, I guess it depends on how you look at it. Animals cause other animals to suffer, die, go extinct, etc. All that would continue without humans. There's also no guarantee of another species reaching human-level intelligence and screwing things up too. I'd say the sort of traits that would allow a species to reach that point really aren't the sort of traits that would make individuals of that species conservationists.  Anyway, I don't think humans dying out would solve all problems so I'm not really in favor of that. I just hope we stop screwing things up before it's too late.

You could adopt and instill the child your your virtues. It seems fairly unlikely there's an environmentalist gene.  The problem with bringing another person into existence is that you have no guarantee that your child will be environmentally conscious. I think it's pretty clear that a lot of children don't end up doing exactly what their parents want them to, and on average most people aren't extremely environmentally conscious. Even of the people that are environmentally conscious, it takes a huge amount of effort to even offset your own harm completely let alone having an overall positive effect.

Is this gonna be a place worth living in in 50 or 60 years?   If humanity makes no technological, social, or economic changes then a number of ecosystems worldwide 60 years from now will be severely degraded.  The good news is that the chance of there being no such changes is virtually zero!  It is quite possible that the world will be considerably more hospitable to non-human life in 50-60 years. The main reason why is that a number of key technologies are on the horizon that have the potential to transform both 1) how we meet our needs, and 2) the nature of our needs themselves.  I'm happy to answer questions about this in the context of any specific environmental issue, but the tl;dr is that (in my opinion) most environmental pessimism stems from a lack of understanding of the accelerating nature of technological change, and that a better-informed understanding shows that 1) there is reason to be hopeful, and 2) we (in the environmental disciplines) need to reorient policy and planning today if we want to correctly position ourselves to actually deal with daunting environmental problems in the decades ahead."

environment,3cxy3z,chesterworks,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:17:49 2015 UTC,"It varies somewhat depending on the environmental issue of concern, but the most important one overall will be machine labor.  The primary reason why we don't address environmental problems at present is because the cost is too high. If you work your way back through the supply chain for any product or service, the fundamental factors of production always reduce to labor and energy. Even rare materials are only really rare relative to the labor and energy required to mine them. Machine labor powered by carbon-neutral energy such as solar has the potential to dramatically reduce costs of a wide variety of services, including environmental remediation.  So take a simple example like pollution in the oceans and on beaches. Why don't we just clean up all of that plastic garbage? Because it would be prohibitively expensive to pay people (who have to eat, sleep, live quality lives, etc.) to do that work. But 60 years from now we will have the technology to build robots of various sizes, from the size of the dust mites that live in your eyelashes on up. Robots don't need to have strong general AI in order to do quite sophisticated and very useful work. Insects and other arthropods are instructive examples, as well as a proof-of-concept here. If you drop a bag of sugar on your sidewalk, a thousand ants will happily come along and pick up every single grain. There is no reason to think insect-sized or fish-sized robots in 2065 won't be able to do the same thing with plastic.  Now, if you also have other robots to construct these cleaner-bots, and the whole system runs on solar power that comes from solar installations that are also built by robots from raw materials that are also mined and refined by robots ... you get the idea.  There are more details to get into, but that example gives a general sense of how technology will at least have clear potential to solve environmental problems even on very large scales."

environment,3cxy3z,optimister,2,Sun Jul 12 11:26:13 2015 UTC,"It is becoming clear that mitigation measures alone are not sufficient to stave off the worst effects of climate change. Some form of geoengineering is all but inevitable. In the near term, that is likely to be solar radiation management (SRM), the most effective option of which is sulphate aerosol injection into the stratosphere to mimic volcanic emissions. But that's a bandaid to assuage the symptoms. The full solution to the underlying carbon problem is to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. The safest and cheapest way to do that is with reforestation and afforestation, but we can't physically plant enough trees to sequester 5 trillion tons of carbon in forest biomass. We need to capture CO2 directly from the air and store it underground in deep injection wells. That is the obvious long-term solution, but the problem there is cost. But sometime later this century, perhaps in the 2050s - 60s, machine labor will make direct air CCS at the trillion ton scale feasible."
environment,3cxy3z,adam_dorr,4,Sun Jul 12 14:22:17 2015 UTC,"It is quite possible that the world will be considerably more hospitable to non-human life in 50-60 years.    Could you please expand on this? In particular, I'm very confused by your claim that the planet will be more habitable in half a century which is at odds with practically every academic paper I have ever read on the topic. There might be some ecological niches but at the moment, the rate of extinction is consistently rising and there have been many high-profile predictions of an impending (i.e. in the next few centuries to millennia) mass extinction.  You seem to be getting very excited about the impact technology will have yet at least as far as I can tell, the promise of far-off techno-fixes just seems to be used as an excuse to allow people to pollute more and respond less urgently to the crisis we're in the middle of. What technological fixes are you predicting are going to make the planet more habitable in 50 years, anyway?

The only thing I can think of is geo-engineering and that seems to be causing more harm than good.   Complacency is a real concern, but so is ignorance and fatalism.  The reason why it is possible that the world will be more hospitable to non-human life in 2075 is that we will have the means (via technology) to drastically reduce our ecological footprint on the planet. We will be much less dependent on ecosystem services to provide for our own needs. Overfishing, for example, will be less of a problem when food can be printed out of a 3D printer. We will also be able to modify our needs directly by altering our bodies and brains. Imagine, for example, how much smaller humanity's ecological footprint would be if we could reprogram our brains' perceptions so that carrots tasted like prime rib and celery tasted like ice cream. Both of these are technologies that we can expect to be quite mature by 2075.  Whether or not we choose to use technology in an environmentally benign way is a different question, but technology (mainly in the form of machine labor which will slash the cost of environmental remediation, but other things too like the examples I mentioned above) will at least give us the option."
environment,3cxy3z,adam_dorr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:25:51 2015 UTC,"You are making a huge number of massive assumptions there. Are you seriously making the claim that the global food crisis is going to be solved by 3D printing technology by 2075? With all due respect, that sounds slightly crazy (as does ""we will be able to modify our needs by altering our bodies and brains"").   Is this actually academic literature that you're citing or the work of transhumanist philosophers?"
environment,3cxy3z,Chlorophilia,2,Sun Jul 12 11:14:50 2015 UTC,"We have to make assumptions about the future, there's no getting around that. The key is of course to make informed assumptions.  Part of what I argue in my work is that the so-called ""conservative"" assumption that technology will only change marginally over the remainder of this century is actually far less realistic than the assumption that technological progress will continue to accelerate. In particular, the price-performance of computing is very likely to continue to accelerate for at least several more decades before we begin to approach the physical limits of 1055 calculations per second per kilogram.  Accelerating change is deeply unintuitive, and without a disciplined effort it is very difficult for people to really grok what exponential growth actually means. The clearest technological example of accelerating change is in the price-performance of computing, which has grown exponentially for more than 100 years. In that time, the number of computations per second that you can buy with one dollar has grown by 20 orders of magnitude. As a fun and instructive exercise, what does your intuition tell you about how tall a linear graph showing 20 orders of magnitide would need to be? OK, now start to draw that graph and then calculate how tall it actually would need to be.  Apple's 2015 iWatch is 160,000 times faster, 70,000 times cheaper, and 100,000 times smaller than the supercomputers that NASA used in 1965. If this trend continues, in 2065 machines the size of dust mites or blood cells will have the computing power of your cell phone and cost about 1/10 of a penny.  The continued shrinking and cheapening of computers points to several key technological tipping points later this century. One is narrow machine intelligence and the replacement of much of human labor by robotic labor. Self-driving cars are only the beginning of this. By 2065 there will little if any work a human can do that a machine cannot do much better. A second is sophisticated microscopic machines, commonly referred to as ""nanobots"".  Setting aside the social, economic, and political implications (these get lots of attention already), there are extraordinary environmental implications of replacing most human labor with machine labor and having machines of all sizes from microscopic on up. For example, it's hard to imagine how we might clean up all of the plastic garbage in the world's oceans and beaches today. But that's because only humans can presently do that work, and it would be too expensive to have 100 million people work full time doing this kind of clean up. If we had a billion robotic fish and insects to do this work, then the problem becomes much more tractable. The same goes for building millions of warehouse-sized direct-air carbon capture and storage facilities around the world. And so on.  The same technologies that enable microscopic computers as powerful as your cellphone by 2065 will be the same ones that enable the atomically-precise 3D printing technology and brain-machine interface technologies that seem impossible to uninformed observers today."

SRM is a terrible idea for very obvious reasons (yet for some reason, philanthropists like Bill Gates are pouring money into it) and I'm pretty skeptical of CCS too. Whilst obviously a CCS coal or gas plant is better than a coal or gas plant without it, CCS is still only being developed to allow petroleum companies to continue operating instead of allowing investment to go towards genuinely sustainable alternatives. And there's a critical difference between CCS and atmospheric CO2 scrubbers, namely that CCS only reduces emissions rather than actually removing CO2 from the atmosphere."

It made a lake of standing oil. I believe deepwater horizon is viewed as the largest U.S. marine spill while the gusher is the largest land spill. The gusher dumped about 9 million barrels.

Two thoughts come to mind:  The first is the government papering over the issues that caused the 2008/9 financial crisis. We passed a law or two to placate the public, and the entire unregulated derivatives market chugs on waiting for the next disaster.  The second is to consider the source: NPR. While NPR offers soft, objectively-spun criticism from a liberal perspective, we should never forget that NPR is funded by the US government and corporations (and a few people who contribute to their never-ending fund drives); thus NPR will never tackle our deep-seated issues of systemic corruption or question the fundamental growth-based mindset or morality of capitalism."

environment,3cvlfj,jvnk,4,Sat Jul 11 17:17:27 2015 UTC,"Do you listen to much NPR?   Sadly, yes. For actual news there are not any alternatives where I live.   Because they routinely do what you're talking about. They do have hard-hitting investigative journalism.   We clearly have a difference of opinion. I see NPR as merely supporting the status quo and position of the government and big business. FAIR and others have reported that NPR and PBS have more current and former government officials than many other sources, sometimes even those clearly on the political right.  When it comes to militarism and foreign policy, NPR is just as gung-ho as the rest of the US mass media.  On domestic issues they offer some criticism, but they never deal with systemic corruption nor offer any coherent criticism of the corruption inherent to capitalism.  For issues like this oil disaster, NPR has or will quibble over the lies about the amount of spillage, they'll offer up emotional stories about dead birds and such to mindlessly pull on our heartstrings, and they'll celebrate government legal victories or cash payments as some sort of systemic change which solves the problem.  But NPR will rarely deal with BP's long history of murder and their shoddy environmental record, nor will they ponder how to address those issues. And they will never, ever deal with the fact that our corrupt government works hand-in-glove with corporations to cover these things up and to quickly exit them from the news cycle.   Their funding structure is markedly different from what you suggest, as well   The fact that roughly a third of their budget comes from gullible people who believe in NPR doesn't mean much to me.  I liken it to Obama's bragging about how much money he collected from individuals during his campaign: When it comes down to actual policy who gets listened to and who calls the tune, who is going to have their concerns heard and addressed -- the many individual people contributing a $50 or $1500 pittance, or the government who can regulate them out of existence and/or the corporations/foundations who write the big, fat checks? One only has to critically examine NPR's coverage to see/hear the answer.

I think your analysis of NPR is not borne out by evidence to support your claim other than this:   FAIR and others have reported that NPR and PBS have more current and former government officials than many other sources, sometimes even those clearly on the political right.

environment,3cvlfj,Decolater,4,Sat Jul 11 18:44:32 2015 UTC,"The fact that everyone is biased does not make everything said untrue.   I never said that they reported untrue things -- you're putting words in my mouth.  Like all skilled propaganda organs, NPR typically lies by omission and spin. Only crude propaganda outlets lie by outright lies which can be proven untrue. And only fools use strongly worded, overt propaganda that raises red flags of its target audience. The best propaganda is subtle, so subtle that it slips by the defenses of its target audience. This is what NPR does -- subtle and with many omissions.  As a disabled vet, I thought your two examples of NPR's ""good"" reporting about the mustard gas and the VA hospitals were comical and a classic illustration of what I said above.  NPR says with faux shock that the VA broke its promise to the mustard gas victims. But do they reference the years of denial by the VA of the claims of Vietnam-era Agent Orange victims? Of course not. Does NPR state the fact that the VA medical system has been used by the US government to conduct medical experiments on unwitting veterans in every decade since the 1920s? Would such a fact be in NPR's background to a story? Of course not! Such context likely would cause Americans to be outraged and to know that we have systemic problems, that our government is simply brutal and that it doesn't really care about veterans (other than rhetorical lip service, of course).  In the story about veterans returning to a ""broken"" VA system, the entire story focuses on ""wait times"". But does NPR cover the issue that the entire goal of the VA is to ""heal"" veterans so they can be pushed out onto the for-profit corporate medical system that Obama shoved down the nation's throat? That the VA's mission is in many ways not to give care, or to give care in such a way as to pressure people not to use the VA? Of course not. NPR actually spins the crimes committed against Agent Orange vets that I mentioned above into a slight positive in this article, and they did it in the typical NPR fashion by using a selective quote from a non-NPR source (thus maintaining distance and so-called objectivity) -- utterly brilliant propaganda! (I never said these people were not highly skilled at what they do -- they are.)  These types of systemic issues are not dealt with by ""all things considered"", nor is the conspiratorial angle that those ""decades-old problem"" of wait times may indeed be a deliberate strategy to accomplish the goal of pushing people out of the VA system and to reduce the massive costs (literally trillions of dollars) of the VA's promise to veterans resulting from our many wars of aggression. Again, spin and deception by omission.  But hey, if you believe in NPR and all of its rhetoric, just keep believing in the organization.  NPR will lull you to sleep and eventually you may come to believe things like NPR saying that the deliberate torture that we inflicted on countless people in our wars was really just ""abuse"" or ""enhanced interrogation"" -- lies by euphemism that NPR repeats endlessly day after day even after Obama admitted that we tortured ""some folks"". As the old saying goes, ""It is not possible to awaken those who only pretend to sleep.""   ""The chief problem in historical honesty is not outright lying. It is omission or de-emphasis of important data. The definition of 'important', of course, depends on one's values."" -- Historian Howard Zinn."

Well, farmers also can't save seeds from patented organic or conventional crops either.   I don't think the author of the article has properly researched why people are complaining about this, and the justification that the author has given is not an excuse. One of the major arguments that people use in favour of GMO seeds is that they can be used to lift people out of poverty, for instance by providing drought-resistant seeds to drought and famine stricken areas. The problem is that this advantage completely evaporates when farmers in these extremely poor areas (such as eastern India) can't afford these seeds in the first place because they have to keep buying them every year, so either can't benefit from them or end up falling into catastrophic debt, an issue that has been identified over and over again in India.

I never argued that patenting is unique to GMO seeds, I simply said that the fact that they are patented (or more specifically, the fact that Monsanto et al charge extortionate prices for them and force farmers to pay per year, since the seeds could still be patented without these draconian measures) and the argument that they can be used for humanitarian causes are mutually exclusive.
