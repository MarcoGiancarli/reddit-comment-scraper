Louisiana,3dpsmw,pluslabellevie,30,Sat Jul 18 07:08:23 2015 UTC,"I know you mean well with your question but you're pretty far off. I've (white male) had zero issues with my long time brown girlfriend anywhere in Louisiana. The only thing even close to trouble has been from other African Americans who have given her a hard time about why a ""brother"" is not good enough for her. Even that has been rare though."
Louisiana,3dpsmw,ZanderCruze,9,Sat Jul 18 07:42:38 2015 UTC,"I'm really glad to hear this. It hadn't occurred to me initially that there might be a problem, but then several people I spoke to advised me against it, and I began to worry. Thank you."
Louisiana,3dpsmw,painperdu,16,Sat Jul 18 07:56:48 2015 UTC,Just be careful around African Americans and you'll be fine.
Louisiana,3dpsmw,SpikeTheBunny,-14,Sat Jul 18 08:59:40 2015 UTC,"Seriously? This is what you thought would contribute to the conversation and ease her fears? This is what other people in this sub thought was worthy of an upvote?   ""Just be careful around African Americans?""  I...seriously, y'all? Is this where we're headed? Is this what we're doing now?"
Louisiana,3dpsmw,SkylineDriver,7,Sat Jul 18 13:53:06 2015 UTC,Its evident you're the only one who took it serious. The satire is blatantly obvious in his statement.
Louisiana,3dpsmw,SpikeTheBunny,-2,Sat Jul 18 16:06:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, well I kinda do take it seriously since I'm an African American who has had a really good relationship with this community/subreddit. Many of you all know me personally. I have made actual close friends around here. The people I have become aquanted with respect me...and my race. I consider this a safe place with good people.   So yes. I did take it seriously. It does hit me personally when the advice given to someone who is genuinely concerned about her well being in the face of racism in an unknown environment is told to just stay away from me. What the hell did I, my friends, or my family do to warrant that? How was that at all satirical?"
Louisiana,3dpsmw,painperdu,5,Sat Jul 18 16:22:56 2015 UTC,What was the real answer you were looking for? That White people are attacking Black people down here? Are you really that dense?
Louisiana,3dpsmw,SpikeTheBunny,2,Sat Jul 18 18:05:48 2015 UTC,"Who's question? Mine? I just asked are we seriously going to tell a woman-of-color to simply avoid other people-of-color in order to ease her fears.   I actually have experienced white police officers attack my family members for absolutely no reason at all. Louisiana has a lot of good aspects, but a lot of very bad things still happen. I wanted to let this lady know that she will probably have no problem at all. But I'm not going to pretend like her concern was invalid.     I really don't think some people understand how traveling in some areas while black is really dangerous. She asked the question in order to help plan her trip and take precautions if necessary. It has nothing to do with how ""dense"" a person is. No, this isn't the 1950's, but a lot of factors affect people-of-color that many white people will never have to even consider. This lady was concerned about her personal safety, she asked on this forum, people gave mostly informative answers, and her fears were calmed. Why does anyone have to be dense?"
Louisiana,3dpsmw,painperdu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:29:50 2015 UTC,"Well, people of color have a greater chance of violent confrontation with other people of color. You know that, of course.  Did you take in what the initial respondent told you? "" The only thing even close to trouble has been from other African Americans who have given her a hard time  . . ."" This is not isolated to New Orleans. I'm sure you're well aware that it happens in Illinois as well. Why doesn't this upset you? Why no concern over this?"
Louisiana,3dpsmw,SkylineDriver,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:00:15 2015 UTC,"I consider this a safe place with good people.   That might be your problem. ""This"" is a website. One that has the potential to contain text that may or may not offend you if you can't see the emotion by the author put into it. His post was purely satirical and again, how you missed that is beyond me. Relax. There are good people here."
Louisiana,3dpsmw,SpikeTheBunny,0,Sat Jul 18 16:49:07 2015 UTC,"I completely understand that this is a website. Honestly, I just realized my mistake. I thought I was in my community's subreddit rather than /r/Louisiana. That section of this website does have a bit of a different feel for me. If I am wrong in that thought, hell, my bad. But that has been different for me because it was such a small community attached to actual people, not just usernames. I thought I was among actual friends, and it caught me off-guard.  I understand satire, and still have no idea how stay away from black people is satirical.   But, you're right, this is not to be a ""safe-place."" Offensive comments are fine. No one is trying to be my friend, trying to keep from hurting my feelings, or trying not to be offensive to an entire race for no reason other than ""satire."" So, I'll just keep it moving."

Louisiana,3dpsmw,Scorpion5679,6,Sat Jul 18 16:59:37 2015 UTC,The cultures are different from North LA and South LA. The culture of east TX is the same as North LA. Very religious protestants.

Only recommendation, let your friend know not to be defensive. Your biggest chance of an issue is a black dude saying something fresh your boy popping off, justifiably perhaps....but triggering something serious."
Louisiana,3dpsmw,aSaaadPanda,-1,Sat Jul 18 07:24:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, thank you. That makes me feel better. A few people had said to be wary coming out of Houston on the I-10, but we'll keep our heads down as you say and ignore any dumb comments!"
Louisiana,3dpsmw,tlh053,9,Sat Jul 18 07:29:15 2015 UTC,"Vidor, TX, had a bad reputation as a sundown town. Otherwise, feel free to stop when and wherever. People are very friendly, in my experience, especially when you stop for food. Stop in Lafayette, LA, and get some food, gas up, and take a bathroom break. There's a really long bridge between Lafayette and Baton Rouge with zero stops for almost 20 miles and traffic can be terrible."

I had my food spit in once by some racists in one of those towns.    Any severe racism problems you run into will be in eat Texas and northern Louisiana.  Closer you get to the south, the better things are."
Louisiana,3dpsmw,todayilearned83,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:54:55 2015 UTC,Thank you for this - it's really helpful.
Louisiana,3dpsmw,card797,3,Tue Jul 21 15:16:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think you have anything to worry about. Whites are the minority in New Orleans so its extremely receptive to different races. As for the rest of the I-10 corridor, I think you'll be fine. Going through St. Martin Parish and Breaux Bridge the cops are kind of dicks but I don't think they're necessarily racist. Just go the speed limit the whole way - but especially between Lafayette and Baton Rouge (tons of speed traps).   BTW, you will want to stop here and get boudin."
Louisiana,3dpsmw,card797,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:39:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, thanks for the recommendation! I will be careful with the speed limit."
Louisiana,3dpsmw,Scorpion5679,8,Tue Jul 21 15:17:22 2015 UTC,"Girl.. You'll have no issues. And if you do, then I'm sure there will be 10 other people to stick up for you. I'm white, but I, like many of my friends, don't see skin color. Just people. We're from Baton Rouge. New Orleans is so crazy and outgoing and fun, there shouldn't be anything wrong with you going  and having a good time, you'll probably even meet some cool people!"

Louisiana,3dpsmw,cajungator3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:03:12 2015 UTC,"Avoid I-10 east of Lafayette if you can. Take 90 south through Houma and it will bring you out on the west side of NOLA. If there's an accident on the Basin Bridge, you can sit there for hours. Taking 90 is about 20 miles longer, but much of it is 70 mph on the speed limit, and you can always get off on a service road if there is an accident."

Louisiana,3dpsmw,Manic_42,0,Tue Jul 21 15:17:55 2015 UTC,"If you take that route, you can stop and see a restaurant that was frequented by the New Orleans crime family. It's an old school Italian restaurant well outside of the city that mobsters used to go eat, and make deals. http://moscasrestaurant.com/  Also, south Louisiana is pretty chill when it comes to racism. Don't get me wrong, people are prejudiced, but they mostly keep it to long and angry rants on social media."

Louisiana,3div3o,todayilearned83,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:01:09 2015 UTC,"This is a poorly written article at best or a complete slander at worst. It takes a small amount of truth and wraps that in a spin directed at the sole purpose of airing old, dirty laundry and taking low shots at a handful of states by using partial data and arguing the logical fallacy of ""correlation implies causation.""   Undertones aside, the article focuses on the idea that that the south is for some reason attempting to squash peoples' abilities to make a living through a variety of means such as underpaying labor or having no minimum wage.  One particular element that bothers me is the repeated jibe at the 5 states that do not have minimum wage laws: that is nothing but a way to target those 5 states which happen to be in the south with incomplete information. Here's some more complete information: at least 5 states have all or parts of their minimum wages lower than the federal minimum wage; at least 15 states have all or parts of their minimum wage set to 7.25/hr (many are keyed to the federal minimum wage). source  There is no difference at the current moment between a state law that says the minimum wage is $7.25/hr and no state law at all. This is just a spin on a small amount of information."

For a list like this I would want it to be an established restaurant thats been there for a while.  One that has history.  Moms is just generic to me.  Throw up a few fleur de lis and thats all it takes it seems :/    Its really just a place to go drink and get greasy food."
Louisiana,3daapn,CheeseSharp,2,Wed Jul 15 16:22:34 2015 UTC,This seems to be more of a random list which attempts to hit different geographical areas across the state in an attempt to seem all-inclusive than a list of amazing restaurants.

It's a big deal in the Shreveport area but I always found the food a bit bland and nothing to write home about.  The owners are friendly people.  It's in the Shreveport Times a lot, so I get the impression it's more ""famous for being famous"" than famous due to the food."

You think  heavy breakfast with those carbs, but remember, the old timers worked it off and needed fuel for the hard work. Now today?Since the typical person is a tourist or a 9-5 office type, the same high carb faire would not typically be healthy, but for the one time feast be a treat. So a meat, typically pork product, eggs, grits, home baked bread toasted or room temp, and coffee . You could be sent out the door with a meat between two pieces of bread There was no fruit cantaloupe, berrys, etc, for breakfast, unless you grew strawberries or had fruit trees in the yard, then you had home made jam. I am recounting from my childhood days growing up rural, typical of the surrounding area, so YMMV."

As there is no standard definition of what constitutes a city or town (by population) we see towns with delusions of grandeur.    On your list Ruston is #19.  Ruston is not a city.  I work in Ruston.  At best it's a big town.  The same with many ""cities"" on this list."

Louisiana,3c13s1,SkylineDriver,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:07:06 2015 UTC,"Right but what I'm detecting here, and what I was initially respondibg to is a whiff of Jendal-esque ""our religious freedom is violated by having to serve folks whose lifestyle we are opposed to."" So to use the most convienient analogy, if a business refuses to served coloreds (and let's not forget people used religion to underpin those arguments as well), it's not weither or not the colored folks care to patronize the business or not. The issue is the business not being able to perpetuate the descrimination."

As /u/cajunbander points out below, the issue is conflating religious beliefs with the duties of a state position.

Bobby Caldwell needs to get off his ass & issue a letter to all clerks statewide indicating that they should proceed with issuance of licenses in accordance with the most recent Supreme Court ruling.

It doesn't matter that 90+% of the people are going to be trolling him - those 90% wouldn't vote for him anyway, and looking like he's persecuted will help him with the people who will support him.  He doesn't need to get numbers necessary to make it through the primary. He just has to get high enough numbers that he's not bumped out of the fundraising game before he's got a chance to stand on stage with other hopefuls.

I'm not familiar with any other incognito spots that I'd recommend. Either go to claiborne, darbone, or lincoln parish park ;( . Other than that you gotta know private land owners to get to the best spots.   https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kens+Landing+Rd,+Dubach,+LA+71235/@32.7076742,-92.5244192,14z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x8631de0011bf8b29:0x40e063132e69ab73"

Whereas, in the case of JoP's who refuse to give marriage licenses to gay couples (for the essentially the same religious objections), Jindal stands behind them.  Because he just plain doesn't like gay people."

They were given instructions concerning Confederate decorations, but none about ISIS decorations, because no idiot would make an ISIS cake.  This guy went to all 4 Wal-Marts in town, and asked for both cakes. He was baiting these minimum wage employees into being pawns for his crusade."

Louisiana,3bjls3,mengo81,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:28:21 2015 UTC,"They probably didn't know what an ISIS flag looks like.   I've worked in retail. The way retail works is give the customer what they want. In a Walmart bakery, the process goes like this: ""This person wants x cake. Is the image or message they want on this list of y things we can't do? No. Bake the cake."" The Confederate Flag was on that list, the ISIS flag wasn't.  It's a double edged sword for the employee. They bake the cake and there's public outrage. Don't bake the cake, the customer gets mad, and you risk getting in trouble with your manager. I'd be willing to bet someone working at Walmart can't afford to lose their job."
Louisiana,3bjls3,cajunbander,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:57:22 2015 UTC,I had no idea what the ISIS flag looked like until I saw the post about the version of it flown at the Gay Pride event being mistaken for it.

Louisiana,3bkbr5,BlankVerse,2,Mon Jun 29 22:39:55 2015 UTC,Looks like the vast majority of the parishes are issuing marriage licenses as of yesterday.  There are a few holdouts claiming they need legal guidance from the state or just haven't gotten their software updated yet.
Louisiana,3bkbr5,melance,2,Tue Jun 30 12:50:32 2015 UTC,"Who's going to have the last parish/county not issuing same-sex marriage licenses: Louisiana, Alabama, or Texas? IIRC someone has already resigned so they don't have to issue same-sex marriage licenses.  There won't be any formal boycotts, but between the Confederate Battle Flag controversies and same-sex marriage opposition, I imagine there will be some effect on decisions on conventions, plus business development and relocations for most of the Southern states. Especially in places like tourist-dependent New Orleans, that can't be good."
Louisiana,3bkbr5,melance,3,Tue Jun 30 13:47:54 2015 UTC,I agree wholeheartedly.  The exceptionally loud uber-conservative people of the state are going to drag us down into an economic whole we can't get out of for years to come.  The recent announcement that Disney won't be filming here anymore due to Jindal adding caps to the tax deductions is going to make the line at the unemployment office more unbearable and going to empty the coffers.
Louisiana,3bkbr5,absolutspacegirl,2,Tue Jun 30 13:51:12 2015 UTC,"That's another thing: Jindal and Huckabee are also going to reinforce the stereotypes of Bible-thumping, science-denying Southerners."

Shit, that's not even one business day.  I would even give some of these states a week to ponder out how to make the legal stuff work / what to do about their forms that say 'bride and groom'.  The time isn't the issue - if it were months that would be a problem.  It has more to do with the fact that he doesn't want people to be free to do this at all.  Although I'm glad he is saying that so voters know where he stands."
Louisiana,3bfss8,Deradius,4,Mon Jun 29 10:51:45 2015 UTC,"He knew one day that the ruling would be coming. Instead of having a system in place to accept their ruling, he choose to puff up his chest and talk about how the Supreme Court should be disbanded and became the last state to accept the ruling. What it did was make him look petty and weak. As far as forms go, a guy from IT can change bride and groom to Spouse #1 and #2 within 15 minutes. This isn't 1989 where new forms need to be Xeroxed."
Louisiana,3bfss8,Deradius,-1,Mon Jun 29 13:24:12 2015 UTC,"They don't need to be Xeroxed.  They do need to be printed because they need to be signed.  Can we print locally or so they all need to be printed on special paper that is only kept in one warehouse and distributed to all the counties or parishes?  The guy from IT can't change jack without approval.  Who approves it?  Probably depends on the state, and we probably need some time to figure that out.  What should the wording on the certificate say?  Well, we probably need a committee to decide that.  Someone will need to vote.  Does the legislature need to get involved to make these kinds of changes?  This is government work.  It takes three politicians, six lawyers, and a union contracted mime to change a street light.

Lefties hate David Vitter because he's a conservative white guy that goes to church, not because he got some trim on the side.

Why does Willie get a free pass even today    A free pass for what? He's not currently in office, and he's not currently running for anything.  OK, you win, I won't vote for him for anything because he cheated.  Happy?   but lefties shit their britches over David Vitter?

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album.

Well now that they have done that, instead of it washing away from the outside, it has started washing away from the inside out.

Also he made a big push to have the Bible deemed a ""science textbook"" in public schools (see also: Louisiana Science Education Act"").  Both of these efforts were in direct puppethood to two of his main campaign donors, the Louisiana Family Forum (vehement anti-gay org) and Americans For Tax Reform (referenced in the article). In addition he tries really hard to put on a Christian front -- I don't know what his real religion is, and probably no one ever will, b/c he's too much of a political opportunist to ever say anything other than Catholic/Christian.  Icing on the cake: he has spent more time campaigning for president than being in Louisiana.  TLDR: He's a prototypical example of a guy who wants to be president for its own sake. He has no ideals, he has no sense, he just wants to be pres and the only reason anyone's ever taken him seriously is b/c he just about the only brown Republican in existence."

This is an effort to boost his ""brand"" and be able to swing around more political weight in the future.  He'll fold out of the race gradefully in time and make a big show of telling his followers to go support candidate X, and if that candidate wins he'll collect favors whether it be financial or political.  Furthermore he'll always be ""worth"" more in the political scene as he'll be able to say ""Former governor and presidential candidate Bobby Jindal""  He'll probably do speaking tours and write a book and get a seat in the senate or something similar.   And that's how the game is played. When someone like him or Donald Trump announces their campaign and reddit falls over itself to laugh at them, you're really doing just what they want. Giving them attention.  They know they would never win. It's not about winning.

Louisiana,3ayujv,Holinyx,8,Wed Jun 24 22:46:22 2015 UTC,"Same reason Trump does it. Their ""brand"" goes up in value by making an attempt, no matter how much of a long shot it is. His name carries more weight for whatever he wants to do as instead of just ""Former governor of Louisiana"" he is now ""Former governor of Louisiana and 2016 presidential candidate"".  It's just a stepping stone to whatever else he wants to do. Win, lose. . . it doesn't matter.   In fact I'd argue he stands to gain more by losing on purpose by sticking to most major hardline republican viewpoints. Then when he inevitably doesn't become president but some spot elsewhere in the political machine opens up, his party's cronies will remember that he pushed their agenda as per usual and will slot him there.  As with Trump, he'll eventually pull out and publicly ask his (small) fan base to show their support for another more likely successful candidate and boom he now has favors and good graces with a potential president."

If he was using taxpayer money to buy television ads or print flyers then he would be using state funds to run for federal office. This is indirect however because the security detail has to follow him when he leaves the state. By not paying for that detail out of his campaign funds he frees up that money to be spent on his pointless campaign."

The fact that a very mild cap is causing so much consternation and apparently will cause all of you to lose your jobs just further proves what a bad idea this is. As soon as the state quits subsidizing you, the whole industry will pack up and leave. Why shouldn't we give this money to an industry that will invest in permanent infrastructure in the state and give Louisiana a chance to create jobs that don't disappear as soon as the spigot is turned off."
Louisiana,39w0r4,jochexum,2,Mon Jun 15 13:13:45 2015 UTC,"Why shouldn't we give this money to an industry that will invest in permanent infrastructure in the state and give Louisiana a chance to create jobs that don't disappear as soon as the spigot is turned off.   ...Honest thought here, why doesn't Louisiana do that whether or not there is a film industry here? And what makes people think that getting rid of the film industry will suddenly make this happen, especially when they can't even come up with an industry to replace it with?"
Louisiana,39w0r4,kmacku,3,Mon Jun 15 22:21:09 2015 UTC,"The State is already pursuing other industries with incentives and has been particularly successful in attracting software development firms (e.g., IBM in Baton Rouge, GE Capital in Nola, CGI in Lafayette, CSC in Shreveport, IBM in Monroe - plus a lot of smaller names, mainly in BR, Lafayette, and Nola). Just counting those I specifically named, we're talking 3,000 software development jobs over a couple of years.  But these are lower-level software jobs - not the Facebook and Google and Microsoft types that pay six figures out of school. Those companies locate near and hire from the Stanfords, MITs, and Carnegie Mellons of the world because that's where the best programs, professors, students are. Louisiana offers nothing that remotely competes with those so we settle (happily) for the IBMs of the world.  Think about what we could do if we redirected the money from film into creating assets for the software industry in LA. $150-300 million per year would go so incredibly far. Go out and poach the best professors and pay them double. Go find some software engineer at Google who wants to do something new and let them create a software center of excellence tied to one of the universities. Introduce a revolutionary K-12 curriculum or programs that introduces students to programming.   I don't know what the right answer is, probably a combination of things. Nor do I think we're going to become Silicon Valley or Seattle overnight. The point being though, a quarter billion a year is a helluva lot of money to piss away on something that will walk away at the first threat of being reined in. Why not try and create something more permanent in a field that will only become increasingly more important in the coming decades. Software, robotics, technology in general are the future so why not go all out for those? We could make some serious headway by redirecting that $250 million per year and in something less transient (compared to film), you just have to get the ball rolling and momentum will take care of the rest."
Louisiana,39w0r4,jochexum,-1,Tue Jun 16 00:22:59 2015 UTC,"See, I see no difference between dreaming of Silicon Valley South and Hollywood South. It's just picking poison and hoping to be competitive in the chosen industry. Your paying professors double is the film industry's tax credits. They're both incentive packages to attract industry. Furthermore, I don't think they're mutually exclusive. We can have both.  The big trouble no one wants to mention WRT our geography is the whole hurricane danger. For whatever reason, Los Angeles is okay with sitting in striking distance of an earthquake, but they (and many fortune 500 companies) get a little antsy when talking about opening up offices in New Orleans because they never know when the next Katrina will hit. So New Orleans is, in that way, a bad city for any permanent or long-term industry investment anyways.  The nice thing about the film industry in that regard is that they're used to going out to other places to get their film. What happens when you put in a tech center to the tune of $200+ million dollars and it gets wiped out the next time Mother Nature gets a bit fussy? If you want to know, look at the half-funded hospital, already facing budget issues before its completion. The nice thing about film is they'll find some place to shoot, even if it's a huge ass parking lot, say, in front of the old Six Flags (Jurassic World). Yeah, studio space is nice, don't get me wrong, but there's something to be said about transience: they can set up where they need to, and they'll fix the rest in post.  In a perfect world, though, I'd like to see both: a bustling film industry and a competitive tech industry. I came from a city that was just beginning to see that (and it's plagued by city government problems the way Louisiana is plagued by state government problems), so I know it's possible. My concern is that the conservatives in office are more concerned with making the budget look good than actually be good. Of course, that's par for the course when it comes to state legislature, especially when the head of said legislature is looking to make a potentially certifiably insane presidential bid.  The point I'm coming to is, the film industry didn't come to this city at a cost of tech, or health care, or education. GE's been here for years now, and as of 2013, still swore that New Orleans was a place it was interested in developing. Health care is a federal issue now, and Jindal's being an asshole about the ACA has nothing to do with the film industry. Education is in similar straits with the way that federal funding is handed out. So there's no reason to say, ""Wouldn't it be nice if we had x instead?"" We can have both. Hell, we can have all of it, with the right leadership and fiscal planning. Don't hate on the film industry: hate on the people who fail to write local hire laws. Hate on the people who use sledgehammers for scalpel legislation.  New Orleans pushing out its intellectuals and artists is a huge problem, and it's going to happen one industry at a time. The people left behind are going to fall in up to three categories: the cynics, the elderly, and the hipsters. It's just a matter of time."
Louisiana,39w0r4,kmacku,14,Tue Jun 16 02:19:24 2015 UTC,"From what I know of this bill, it caps a productions film tax credit at $226 million, and provides a mechanism of preference for local productions.

Many fear that if the cap goes into place on July 1, a flood of film producers will begin trying to use tax credits that have been certified but not yet paid by the state, wiping out the $180 million limit imposed by the bill (HB 829) and leaving no incentives left to lure new productions to Louisiana. If the value of those old credits exceeds the $180 million and the state refuses to pay, those people could file lawsuits against the state, alleging the state reneged on the credits it once promised.   Source  A cap on the film tax credit program is sorely needed in Louisiana, and it's a shame that the only solution our legislators could find was something that may put the state at risk of law suits and may create a bottleneck down the line of people trying to cash in their credits. The film industry has had 10 years and more than 1 billion dollars of support from the tax credit program and it is time to limit the most generous film tax credit program in the country."

Louisiana,39w0r4,imspike,3,Mon Jun 15 14:44:52 2015 UTC,"No one is really explaining that right now and that includes the people calling it unconstitutional. It sounds like the state will be able to refuse payment once the yearly $180 million cap is reached, even though there will be people trying to cash in credits they earned during an uncapped year. There may be legal standing for these people to sue the state, but, again, opponents of HB829 have yet to really outline what is unconstitutional about it."

Here's two questions that should help anyone begin to think about it.   Since LA has had these credits, have our state coffers expanded or have they shrank? What does the state need more – universities which give the state a large return on investment, or the film industry which has not yet yielded one cent in profit to the state?   I have many friends that work in the film industry, but we have to be honest with ourselves. The way the credits were set up was a travesty to the state, and they've never made money for the state. When the state is going broke, somebody has to pay, that's just how it is."

The hotel is now filled up to capacity which it never would be in the first place. The show normally spends around 6k a day just for snacks. Then they pay locations for any location they use, which of course is all taxed. All the crew are Louisiana citizens. Their pay checks are taxed (with the money just the truck drivers make they have about 1000 going to taxed each week)  I don't under stand why all the comments I read say that this isn't a real job?

Louisiana,39kpf6,TheBashfulPanda,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:16:47 2015 UTC,"But they did raise taxes - a lot.    And they also added a fee to all university students in the state.   Of course to prevent anyone from paying the fee they added a tax credit to everyone paying tuition.  The ""fee"" isn't a tax, so it doesn't count.   The credit to everyone paying tuition so they don't need to pay the fee does count and therefore it offsets the tax hikes on businesses and cigarettes.   That means it looks like the budget is 'revenue neutral' and taxes weren't raised.  I guess if they can get people to believe trickle down economics they they figure they can get people to believe anything."

It is a rally for the ability to live out one's religious conscience (as I'll try and explain).  I know few on here are going to read this, and most will just downvote it because they notice it disagrees with their opinion, but I'll still post this here because there's a consistent and disappointing lack of diversity of opinion on /r/Louisiana. I see better on /r/politics.  Many in the pro-gay marriage camp constantly accuse those against it of being bigots. A bigot is ""one who is strongly partial to one's own group (e.g. religion, race, gender, political party, etc.) and is intolerant of those who differ."" While certainly there are those like that who are anti-gay marriage, I see a lot of people who vehemently hate my very being for so much as trying to express my opinion or have a reasonable discussion on these things. We don't have to be mad at each other to discuss things; we can have a civil discussion (or possibly even a debate, if so wanted) without bringing heated emotion (from either side) into it.  Now, I highly recommend you read this (actually written by a gay lawyer). He explains how RFRA's came to be and why.  Now, say I'm a Catholic who believes that I cannot get directly involved or aid directly in a gay marriage, and I own a catering business. A gay couple comes to me and asks that I cater their wedding. To do so would be a violation of my own conscience, so I decline. That is not discrimination against them for being gay. Why? Because in any other situation, I would serve them. Either one of them can come to my catering business for anything else like any other customer, but the difference with this scenario is that they are asking that I actively participate in something that I believe to be immoral.  I remember when gay marriage was still trying to be legalized in the first handful of states hearing a lot of things like: ""Nobody's forcing you to participate."" That seems to have gotten thrown out the window.  Edit: removed a part in the last paragraph"
Louisiana,39aw9e,Hormisdas,-4,Thu Jun 11 02:34:46 2015 UTC,"And I agree with you: I do disagree with those who disapprove of interracial marriage.  But my point still stands: it is their right to choose not to participate in a thing they don't feel comfortable with doing (for whatever odd reason that may be). Whereas in any other situation, that business owner would serve interracially married persons, we are talking about having them actively participate in the event, which is different. If the business owner were to deny those persons any kind of service simply because they have married a person of another race, that is discrimination.  A businessperson should have the ability to choose his or her jobs, especially if they contain an element which could go against their moral conscience."

Louisiana,39aw9e,Hormisdas,-1,Thu Jun 11 03:08:12 2015 UTC,"It's interesting which parts off the bible religious people choose to pay attention to. The book says that shellfish are unclean, but you're not taking a stand against Louisiana's crawfish farmers.   What you really have to understand about Biblical interpretation is that the Bible is not meant to be interpreted or seen as one, cohesive work of literature. That's why we call them ""books"" of the Bible: they aren't all written the same. Some books contain psalms, others epics, still others accounts or letters. Therefore, it is very necessary to understand what the piece is. Also, it's very important in Biblical analysis (as with analysis of any form of literature) to know the context.  A Biblical literalist would say that everything in the Bible is to be taken literally; they represent a very small portion of Christians, and for good reason. Many parts of the Bible are not meant to be taken literally or must be viewed in context.  Context is what is necessary to understand Leviticus and other codes of Hebrew laws (which is where you and the others I've previously dealt with get this prohibition against eating shellfish). The majority of the prescriptions and proscriptions contained in Leviticus are part of what is called the Ceremonial law. The Ceremonial law was established by God to remind the Israelites that they were the chosen people and that from them would come the Messiah. However, there also exists what is called the Moral law, exemplified in the Ten Commandments. These laws were to show men their sins (the actions that separate man from God) so that they might grow closer to God.  Now, with the coming of Christ, the Ceremonial law of the Jews was no longer needed, but was fulfilled in Christ Jesus: for Christ himself said, ""Do not think that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets. I have come, not to abolish them, but to fulfill them."" (Mt 5:17) However, while the Ceremonial law was fulfilled, the Moral law still remains, because its purpose is still relevant to this day: to allow man to see the error in his ways, free himself from the bonds of sin, and follow the Lord.   It's only disenfranchised outsiders that people scour religious books for justifications to hate. A century ago it was blacks, now its gays.   It was mostly Protestants, although I will not deny that some Catholics were probably trying to justify their hate alongside them. Hate is never okay. We are called to love all men. And because of that love, we will not be complacent and just say ""It's all okay, man. Do what you want to do."" We will always call sin ""sin."" No, we firmly believe that morals are not subjective. They are not relative. Moral relativism falls apart faster than it can be put together. We accept those who are gay for what they are, but we will not lie to them and tell them to ""do what makes you happy.""   Perhaps as a Catholic, you could have a rally to convince the church not to shield pedophile priests from law enforcement.   If you were more knowledgeable on recent (within the past decade) Church news, you would know that Benedict XVI and his successor have done a lot to get corruption and immoral people out of positions of power in the Church. There is still a long way to go, and nothing can ever be done to change what sick abuses did occur in some dioceses, but to deny the fact that the Church is making a serious effort is willfully keeping your blinders on.   It would be time better spent than this little hatefest.   We fight were the battle lay. The Church is already the largest charitable organization the world; our leadership is always improving (although, again, there are still efforts that must be made); we always stand with you and decry acts of injustice, and unjust war, and rape, and murder. But if we see that there is an effort by some to legitimize immoral actions, we will always stand to fight against it.  And since I can anticipate where you're going to go: no one in the Church tried to legitimize pedophilic acts. What did occur, however, were actions by complacent, corrupt bishops who did not want to handle their diocese correctly. The effort to remove them was slow, but we have seen much more action in recent years.  And since you do wish to decry acts of pedophilia, I'd like to refer you to pretty much any other institution which deals with children, and you will find that they have higher rates of pedophilia. No rate is okay."

By that I mean: I know and have at least somewhat experienced some people's hate (or disagreement) of interracial marriage. But the example you give means very little to me. Are these hypothetical people opposed to one redhead marrying a normal person, or two redheads marrying each other? Or are they simply opposed to the very existence of redheads? Is the event (marriage or not) about ""redheadedness""? Or do these events just happen to include redheads? These are important questions pertinent to the point I'm trying to delineate that don't have apparent answers."
Louisiana,39aw9e,totts1,3,Tue Jun 16 21:41:36 2015 UTC,"When you sell a gay person a cake, you're most likely just selling them the same exact product you would sell a straight person. The only reason you won't sell the gay person that SAME EXACT CAKE is because they're gay? What if you don't like black people? Can you not sell them that same cake because you don't think black people should have the right to marry? How about if they're Muslim? What if they're Christian? Discrimination is discrimination no matter how much you try to talk your way around it. Selling a person a cake in no way means you approve of their marriage. I do wedding photography for all sorts of couples. I don't know any of them or what kind of life they live. And guess what? Frankly, I don't care. People are quick to discriminate gays because it's easy to do. You just look at the couple and immediately jump to the conclusion of ""I don't like this"" just based on what you see. You don't know what kind of people they are. It's judgmental and clearly discriminatory."

Louisiana,39aw9e,Hormisdas,-1,Thu Jun 11 05:17:01 2015 UTC,"Well then let's think this through. A business could not deny service to someone just because they are a redhead (discrimination). They cannot deny service to an event just because it will include redheads. They can deny service to an event about ""redheadedness."" I cannot say anything relating to marriage because I'm still not sure what hypothetical businessman is opposed to.  Let's turn the tables here. You are a caterer. The Ku Klux Klan have decided to hold a peaceful little gathering in a rented hall for a few hundred of their white supremacist buddies. They ask you to cook for them. You say?  (Don't think I'm comparing homosexuality to white supremacy; that'd be stupid. My point is that most people would obviously be uncomfortable with doing this.)"
Louisiana,39aw9e,absolutspacegirl,2,Thu Jun 11 13:15:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you're comparing the two but I would say that in this situation this isn't a good example.  The KKK has a history of violence, hate speech, and illegal activities. Would the event have proper security? What if the only employee available to work that day is black and they fear for their safety? Do I send them?   I wouldn't feel comfortable catering a Bandidos event either but that has nothing to do with my moral conscience and everything to do with worrying there might be a shootout.  But I do get your question - should I be forced to cater something I find morally objectionable? Assuming all of their activities are/have been legal (NAMBLA events shouldn't count, for example), then yes. Maybe the Westboro Baptist Church would be a better example. Yes, I should have to cater one of their events. Would I like it? No. Do I have the right to discriminate against them because I disagree with how they exercise their freedom of speech? No, UNLESS that speech could somehow be used to incite violence."

Louisiana,39aw9e,petit_cochon,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:28:13 2015 UTC,Do you genuinely feel that selling a gay person a cake angers god and contradicts your moral system? I'm trying to wrap my head around this.
Louisiana,39aw9e,Hormisdas,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:03:16 2015 UTC,"If you genuinely want to know what I believe, okay, I'll explain. If you're looking for an argument, I'm too worn out right now to even do it.   Do you genuinely feel that selling a gay person a cake angers god and contradicts your moral system?   Well, this brings a few assumptions to the table that aren't exactly what I believe:   To deny simply selling a cake to a gay person (as in, this thing is already made or would already have been made) would be discrimination in the legal sense and would indeed be wrong. Why? Because the only motivation for the denial of sale seems to be the fact that the customer is homosexual. It is not okay to discriminate against the person for what he is; it is permissible to discriminate (mind you, ""discriminate"" has a negative connotation as well as a legal definition in contrast to the more general, vernacular definitions; I use it here to mean ""to set apart as being different"") non-human entities (as in events, jobs, etc.) And I'll add that the motivation for discriminating against an event can't be because their gay, black, etc. Intent and motivation are an important aspect of this discussion, just like they are in the judicial system. The act of participating in a gay marriage does not ""anger god."" The issue here is that Catholics are called by the Church to not aid in the occurrence of immorality, or associate with it. You seem to say ""your moral system"" as if morals are relative. I reject that in its entirety.   So let me give a brief run-down of my beliefs. I believe that marriage is not a social construct; rather, society itself founds itself on the existence of the family. Rather than being a social construct, I believe marriage is inherent in the human person and that it has a natural order: that of being between a man and a woman. I believe marriage to be properly order to be procreative and unitive.  Now, the union of two homosexual persons can never be ordered toward procreation, because that is directly contrary to their natures: two men or two women could never create a child together. It is in and of itself never possible to be procreative, which naturally precludes them from marriage. All those beliefs (which do have deeper philosophical reasonings behind them, but for the sake of brevity and my sanity I've not taken the time to write them here) together lead me to oppose gay marriage as an institution of the state.  Nonetheless, the state is recognizing them. So now we get to the more Catholic part of my beliefs (as opposed to those others, more rooted in natural philosophy than Catholic theology). I believe that I cannot aid or associate with the occurrence of immorality. I believe that gay marriage is immoral because it is sexual activity which is not ordered towards procreation. Being immoral, I do not want to associate with or participate in the occurrence of a gay marriage.  This is why a say that it is permissible to ""discriminate"" events, actions, jobs, etc. You must understand: the reason we are called to not participate is not because the event involves homosexual persons; it is because of the very event itself. If the marriage were (quite strangely) between two heterosexual men, we would still not be able to participate: not because we don't like heterosexuals, but because the act itself is contrary to right order.  Now, what constitutes participation? Clearly, there are examples of acts which are directly, explicitly, and obviously participatory, and there are others which simply are not and which are clearly not participatory. The problem lies in determining where that line lies. This is why I say intent and motivation is crucial to determining this: because these things can be very subtle. I would put it as the difference between regular work versus contractual/commissioned work. If this hypothetical cake is already going to be made, then one cannot deny them. But if the seller is commissioned to make a cake, this is more active participation that I believe would put it over this line.  The denial of sale cannot be based on the fact that the seller has a personal thing against gays; but if there is a serious reason to believe that the seller indeed does have moral reservations against an action, it is not right to force the seller into acting. Note I say ""serious"" here: this thing on redheads is silly, because, at least in the U.S., there is no real reason to believe that some hold such a view, and also, it is not clear what the belief even is. Some do hold a view, however, that miscegenation is wrong. Are they right in that belief? No. But should we force sellers to participate in an event when it is contrary to their beliefs? No.  Now, with nearly 5000 characters, that's what I believe."

Louisiana,39aw9e,jamesah2008,2,Thu Jun 11 19:44:20 2015 UTC,"How about this? A gas station owner chooses not to allow a gay wedding party to fuel their vehicles at his store because he sees that the gay wedding party pull into his lot. He knows these people are gay for whatever reason and chooses to deny them fuel for their vehicles because they just got gay married. Any person in their right mind would consider buying fuel something that doesn't truly have anything to do with a wedding. However, ""gay marriage"" is against his ""conscience"" so you're okay with him not selling fuel to the homosexuals?  Cake is just another product. To claim that selling a cake is ""participating"" in gay marriage is absurd. I would never in a million years consider a random cake shop to be considered ""participating"" in my marriage ceremony."

I have not seen mention of one in 2015 however.  Personally I just buy a membership for the year and don't think about the ticket price much. It depends on how often you go. The Membership Plus is a great option if you have friends or family come to town. $135 USD/year equates to ~7.12 single fare tickets ($18.95 USD) or four (4) trips by two people. Because the second person on the Plus plan isn't named it can easily be used for a visitor.  I have three friends with a child <2 and one more about to have their first. The membership pass is going to get used a lot more.  One of the member benefits that is really fun is the ""ZOObilation"" day which closed the zoo to non-members after 3 PM and put on a special event with several feeding demonstrations and opening up the behind the scenes areas for members to be able to see.

Louisiana,38phue,WeeManFoo,10,Fri Jun 5 22:25:57 2015 UTC,"Police Jury:  similar to the traditional Commission form of government in other states. The police jury is the governing body and possesses both legislative  and administrative authority for enacting ordinances, establishing programs and setting policy, preparing the budget, hiring of personnel, and other powers. The police jury may contain from five to fifteen members by law, with historical and population provisions for variations, and is elected from single-member districts.  Administrative structures vary widely among the police juries.  The jury is authorized to create the positions of parish manager and administrator to exercise supervision over all administration and serve as head of all departments. (these are ""Police Jury with administrator"" parishes)  Council-President: Home Rule charter. Provides for a full-time president elected at large. Most presidents have strong administrative and veto powers, and serve as the administrative manager as well as chief executive officer. The President-Council parishes have clearly defined legislative and administrative functions.  Council-Administrator: Home Rule charter. Only Caddo Parish. Utilizes an administrator appointed by the council who acts as the sole initiator in administrative affairs.  Consolidated City-Parish: The major city government and parish government have been combined. These are Lafayette with Lafayette Parish, Houma with Terrebonne Parish, Baton Rouge with East Baton Rouge Parish, and New Orleans with Orleans Parish.

The Church doesn't choose to take a stance on matters of science (doctrinally, that is), so a Catholic can still be in full communion with Rome and be a creationist. It's just stupid to.  But I still agree with you: the Vatican has said that Catholics are fully permitted to subscribe to evolution, and with the amount of scientific evidence in its favor, why wouldn't you?"
Louisiana,38d24q,Hormisdas,2,Thu Jun 4 03:36:01 2015 UTC,"The pope is pretty clear on this. He states quite clearly that evolution is correct:  Pope Francis told an audience from the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in Vatican City on Monday that theories of evolution and the Big Bang are not inconsistent with creationism and biblical teaching. “The evolution in nature is not opposed to the notion of Creation, because evolution presupposes the creation of beings that evolve,” Pope Francis said, according to a Vatican newswire transcript of the event.  “When we read in Genesis the account of Creation, we risk imagining that God was a magician, with such a magic wand as to be able to do everything,” he said. “However, it was not like that. He created beings and left them to develop according to the internal laws that He gave each one, so that they would develop, and reach their fullness.”  The creation of the universe, Francis said, was not a singular event, but rather “went forward for centuries and centuries, millennia and millennia until it became what we know today.”"
Louisiana,38d24q,DragonflyRider,2,Thu Jun 4 05:08:17 2015 UTC,"The pope is pretty clear on this.

I'm all for people believing in whatever nonsense helps them sleep at night, but when you start taking time from evidence-based science and give it to creationism (religious reasoning) it sends the message that its a debate. No debate is being had, the educated community is overwhelmingly not supporting creationism as a ""possibility"".   Hell, if we pass this to protect maybe a handful of peoples sensibilities, then we won't have a leg to stand on when muslims demand halal cafeteria food and 30 fucking prayer breaks a day.

After his exclusion from every nationally-televised Republican debate, Roemer announced on February 22, 2012 that he would instead pursue a place on a third-party ticket, specifically the Reform Party and Americans Elect nominations. Shortly after Americans Elect announced they would not be fielding a candidate, Roemer's campaign announced on May 31, 2012 that he was ending his 2012 presidential campaign altogether.

Louisiana,383quu,tunabloodbath,10,Mon Jun 1 17:16:08 2015 UTC,"This is simply one more reason why management should be turned over to the states, who have for decades proved adept at managing wildlife and fishery resources for public use while protecting populations.   This statement is extremely suspect.  Anglers liked the state approach because it was laissez faire.  And that approach has been proven over and over to be the worst thing you can do for conservation purposes.  Look no further than the blue crab overfishing in the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland as what can happen when you take a relaxed attitude to commercial fishing of species.  There's a reason crabs are so rough to find right now in Louisiana.  They overfished Maryland (with the addition of blue crab predators such as puppy drums reaching unprecedented numbers)  to the point where they needed to declare years long moratoriums on crabbing.  Now they are buying our crabs off the dock for FAR more than we are willing to pay just to supplement a food culture where the crab is a staple.  This is exactly the kind of rubberband approach that the federal rules are there to prevent.  If we underfish red snapper because recreational fisherman don't meet their end of the quota then so be it.  It is better than letting it be until we need to declare a 3 year moratorium on all red snapper fishing which would hurt commercial fishing and charters FAR more than the current rules.  You hear this same grousing every year from the shrimp trawling community regarding the season lengths.  And amazingly every year they seem to meet their projected harvest amounts.  It's almost as if the science works!  Crazy I know."
Louisiana,383quu,Freshnukix,-3,Mon Jun 1 18:14:32 2015 UTC,The real issue is that their stock assessments are complete nonsense.  You can catch snapper trolling surface baits now.  They are overpopulating many areas where we fish due to the lack of fishing pressure.  Not to mention the grouper population taking an absolute beating due to anglers not having any other options.

This will bring you though Morgan City, you'll pass north of Houma (You'll be in Gray at that point), and as long as you don't exit on 310 when you see the big ""New Orleans"" sign, you'll cross the Mississippi on the Huey P. and end up in Elmwood. If you're going downtown, I'd suggest you take the Huey P, then continue on Jefferson Highway. Or, you could take the Westbank Expressway and go through Westwego, crossing the river on the GNO.   I should note that I've personally driven all these roads. I'm from Houma, so 90 is my wheelhouse, and I worked offshore for long enough to have left out of Cameron, Freshwater City, and Pecan Island many times."

The arrest itself also seems to be simply to further an agenda concerning that view. ""Look, homeless people have money! They're taking advantage of the system!""  The money this guy had could also have been all he had. We just don't know this guy's story to be able to judge him or the population at large I don't think. People take advantage of systems, not all homeless or all rich people, some people within all economic situations do though. Because of Enron and other coorporate malfeasance, we don't stop all coorporate subsidies or tax breaks, which could be compared to welfare. But I would be much more inclined to feel empathy for a poor person using the system than a rich person or company, and they by far take a lot more money through subsidies ad tax breaks than welfare recipients.  Just how I see it, but thanks for sharing. I'll upvote for keeping the conversation going."
Louisiana,37lucr,Maculous,5,Thu May 28 22:45:36 2015 UTC,"You make some good points.   This is why I love reddit. I get to discuss things with real people instead of watching the bias news.    Yes it is anecdotal.  I hate when journalist use quotes from random people, twitter, or facebook.  They are really putting in their own opinion.  I really don't care if he had money or if he had a lot of money.  If people gave him money, that was their choice.  I love the one point that he was offered several jobs but he rather beg.  This is just human nature.  Why work hard when you get something for free.  Where I live, there are a lot of help wanted signs and a lot of people on welfare.  It doesn't make sense. You can compare welfare to corporate welfare, but you can also compare apples to rocks. A lot of the time, the media refers to corporate welfare when it is only simply tax deductions.  That is very misleading.  There is true corporate welfare like the import-export bank.    I still don't blame the greedy company.  Its their job to make money.  I blame the government for making the rules that gives the company the money.   I also blame the greedy politicians which make up the government that make rules to make themselves rich.   Follow any law that comes out,  and then follow the money.  I think all welfare should be personal.  If you like a company, buy their stuff.  If you want to help poor people, give them stuff.  It's very simple."
Louisiana,37lucr,Maculous,1 point,Fri May 29 14:17:01 2015 UTC,"Discussing politics in a respectful manner? What is this odd place?! lol  On your second point of him not taking jobs offered to him; I still think this article in particular just doesn't give us any information on this guy's story. It's all second hand. Poverty is cyclical, and makes it difficult not just to clean yourself up and get a reliable way to get to and from work and a place where you can live, but to keep that pattern going. He also may be infirmed with his age, unable to do certain tasks. So, he may have been ""offered"" jobs. We just don't know his situation enough I think for that anecdote to matter.  But this guy probably isn't even on the welfare radar, so that secondary discussion kind of got brought up without his particular situation being part of that issue, though it deals with poverty in general. For sure government beuracracy (sp?) and incompetence are the biggest walls to getting any real accountability dealt with in regards to taking advantage of welfare/taxes/subsidies. Hell, that's anything in government. And I don't know the answer to fixing that (edit: except for people going to actually vote and getting really involved in the political process instead of being passive viewers). But the calls I hear to just get rid of it seem blind to the problem. If welfare was just removed entirely, all the people that do work, and are somehow making ends meet while needing that foundation to provide for their family would be out on the street doing what this guy was doing, then putting them into the homeless poverty cycle, which is nearly impossible to crawl out of. Then the economy is affected by an increasingly marginalized workforce which grows and grows and then we all suffer. Part of the reason we have these safety nets isn't just for the individual's or family's benefit, it's to the benefit of all of us, keeping us a strong nation with a healthy workforce that values education and all those things. Remove that safety net, the economic problems we're having now would just get worse and worse. Same reason we give money for a public education system. It benefits all of us whether we're going to school or not by keeping our neighbors educated, making them good, smart employess, companies are happy, America is happy, etc. But cleaning up the red tape and stopping malfeasance would go a long way to solving most problems."

Ha.. take that.  I agree with your points about welfare.   If people wouldn't live off of welfare, I would be ok with it.   I just don't think the federal government is where this needs to be. They are out of touch and it takes $2 of forced taxation to get $1 of help to people.  Without any government involved, we can still take care of this problem.  In a republic, a bill needs a to have the majority of people support the bill before it passes.  If this is true, why do you need a law to do something that most of the people support.  I can support a social safety net without supporting government welfare."

With all of that said, once St. George is a city and they have their own school system (late 2017 at best), they're going to hate what they built.  Everyone's been operating under the assumption that St. George will have a majority-white, majority-middle-class school system (like those of Zachary, Central, Livingston, and Ascension).   What they've failed to acknowledge is that the majority of school growth for the past 20 years in the South/Southeastern part of EBR Parish has been from young black and Hispanic families.  By the time that the St. George School System comes into existence, it will have (at best) a school system that is 60% black, about 10% Hispanic, and about 70% 'economically disadvantaged', and with no magnet schools.  So, the question is: How many of those private school families are going to take their kids out of those schools and send them to St. George public schools?  We already know the answer.

Non-fiction * Rising Tide, by John Barry: A history of the 1927 flood, does a good job of explaining culture, poverty, and government  * Huey Long, by T Harry Williams: a long read, but filled with first hand accounts of life with the Kingfish * Inside the Carnival, by Wayne Parent: fantastic explanation of the silly and frustrating world of Louisiana politics * One Dead in the Attic, by Chris Rose: a collection of post-Katrina columns by a Times-Picayune reporter.   Fiction * The Awakening, by Kate Chopin: a classic anyway, it explores the stifling world of upper class society in the 19th century  *  All the King's Men, by Robert Penn Warren: the story of the writing of this book is almost as good a lesson in Louisiana politics as the book itself *  Modern Baptists, by James Wilcox: I haven't personally read this one, but I've heard good things.  Bonus Movie: In the Electric Mist: YMMV, but I found this pretty representative of small town relationships."

Louisiana,36q9bq,bacchusthedrunk,0,Thu May 21 16:27:57 2015 UTC,you should read this executive order instead of taking a biased extreme left leaning organization's views on it.   It doesn't target LGBT community.  It targets the government.

Louisiana,36q9bq,bugaboosql,1 point,Tue May 26 08:25:19 2015 UTC,"it's not an anti-discrimination law.  It's discriminating against religious people.     You can't legislate what people think and how they feel.   When you try, you will get unintended affects.  This hurts other people.   Why fight against the government?  Politicians who run government are usually corrupt.  They can force people to do things.   If not for the government enforcing slavery, It would have never existed.  The government takes the money I earn, and gives it to people down the street.  They have newer cars then I do.  They get free food and free housing.  Then they live better than I do.  The government goes overboard with everything.   Crime and pollution are down but the government is spending more money than ever.  People are greedy and selfish.  Politicians are the same and only want power and money.  They lie and cheat to grow their own wealth."

Louisiana,36ot52,rapcat,4,Thu May 21 01:52:12 2015 UTC,"thankyou, i see both sides of the argument much clearer now.  disclaimer: i dont spells good, grammar aint my strong suit. Also im a fan of run on sentence structures, and pretty much everything else 'bad' as far as writing goes.  the following is not directed at you or anyone specifically, just a rant  < this was added as it was originally a response to a post.     what does a business need protection from? the purpose of a business is to generate a profit by providing a good or service, or at the very least, to provide a good or service. which boils down to just giving something.     What POSSIBLE good outcome can come from a business not allowing a customer to patron at their establishment?  i am all for individual rights for a person, but as long as that does not restrict another person in doing so.     How ever, i am more than fine with the country / state making it illegal for a business to refuse service to a customer based on religious or other views. We already went through that in the 60's. It doesn't matter if we are arguing over colors, shapes, or sex, its a childish argument to have and an outdated stance to hold.  how do you think the oppressed feel? living in a country which claims to be so free, sure that's what people say, but what are the actions you see?     so if i start a business, why would i want to refuse a guest? i assume most of the issues are coming from refusal of service? I very well could be wrong but this is the only issue that springs to mind. What other demand could a citizen possible have for a business?  This is creating a situation where we are splitting up citizens and creating a 'superior group' Should we allow small businesses to no longer allow black / asian / anything other than white people to patron an establishment?      Im curious how everyone would feel if the table was turned and a place like MacDonalds just refused service to all non white people, or doubled the price for all non white customers. what if taco bell did the same against all non mexican people, or if popeyes chicken did the same against all non black people. Does this sound like a good place to live? Would you feel safe in an environment where you had to learn the places you are not aloud to go because of what you were born into?, something you don't have control over? Or, when you come of age, and have the chance to change things, seek out an equal situation for everyone?  I'm more than busy focusing on my self, i don't have time hating on everything that doesn't look or act like me, what good would it do.  i wasnt planning on writing a book, sorry for the wall of text people.  tldr: people's is people no matter how you slice the pie, stop being racist, homophobic, nationalistic, and bigoted FUCK BOYS Louisiana. Have a good day and thanks for reading!! :)"

Louisiana,36ot52,rapcat,7,Thu May 21 04:15:28 2015 UTC,Jindal signed an executive order saying it's ok to discriminate against gay people.   New York said we're not sending people to Louisiana because of this.
Louisiana,36ot52,twalker294,-6,Thu May 21 02:38:42 2015 UTC,Jindal signed an executive order saying it's ok to discriminate against gay people.   New York said it's ok to discriminate against Louisianians.   FTFY

Louisiana,36ot52,cajunFAITH,2,Thu May 21 13:10:03 2015 UTC,Actually they're not the same thing at all. I'd link you the definition of discrimination but I'm on mobile and I'm sure you're very capable.

I'm totally against what Jindal is doing but what New York is doing absolutely is discrimination by the definition."

Louisiana,36ot52,captoe_slim,4,Thu May 21 05:02:16 2015 UTC,It's because your own definition says to make a decision against a person or thing without taking into account merit.  New York did take into account merit and doesn't want their employees to be treated less worthy just because they are gay.
Louisiana,36ot52,rapcat,-12,Thu May 21 10:51:57 2015 UTC,"Jindal signed an executive order saying that private businesses have the right to serve how they please, based on their own personal beliefs. Because private businesses are ran by people, they are protected by the constitution to have rights and be able to serve however they please. This EO is being pushed because there are people out there who willingly go to specific businesses and try to force them to do things they don't want to, and cry ""discrimination!!"".  This is to protect the small businesses. Not to discriminate.  New York said we're not sending people to Louisiana because of this."

Louisiana,36ot52,SkylineDriver,-9,Thu May 21 03:31:56 2015 UTC,"What do interracial couples have to do with protecting everyone's rights?  Btw, if an interracial gay couple were to own a business, it is their right to be able to sell what they want and how they want it as long as it is to standard.  However, not selling an item to someone that you would then sell to someone else can be discrimination.  That isn't what Jindal is pushing for, he's pushing for equality. Just like we can freely choose where we buy things, the people who sell things can choose WHAT they sell.  You can't force someone to do something they don't do.  It's one thing if a shop makes an item for a specific thing and then denies that same thing to someone else. That's discrimination.  But if a specific shop never does those things, an they refuse to do it for someone, are they discriminating?  Doesn't matter if their religions coincides with their beliefs, IT IS THEIR BELIEFS."
Louisiana,36ot52,cajunFAITH,8,Thu May 21 03:35:46 2015 UTC,If that's what it's about we wouldn't need the EO.

Look, I really dislike Jindal. I'm a follower of Jesus and I own a small business that serves EVERYONE so it'd seem like I'd support Jindal 100%, but that isn't the case.  But this is NOT about giving rights to discrimination. It's protecting business owners from customers trying to force things.  It's sad that there even needs to be a bill for it."

I'm not talking about unemployed people, I'm talking about the job opportunities in this state. Downvote me to hell but most people that I know of that are unemployed are unemployed because they choose to be. I can't blame them honestly because having the government pay for all my shit sounds great but I was fortunate to have a grandfather that drilled ""hard work pays off"" into my young, adolescent mind. My parrain and his cousin both got laid off at Avondale Shipyard years back, they both found jobs within the month. The cousin was laid off again at a different welding shop, 5 weeks later he found a welding job in Lockport. You can't tell me there aren't job opportunities for people in Louisiana.

Here, the executive branch made up a problem. As far as I know, not a single buisness in Louisiana has ever refused to serve a gay marriage, and certainly no buisness in LA has ever been penalized by the government for refusing to serve a gay marriage. This made up problem was taken to the legislative and told to create a law for no reason. When legislative refused, the executive has decided they will do what they want anyway. That not just bypassing government process or not ignoring the people. Thats holding the rule of law hostage to your whims. ""Make this legal or I will.""   If a single business was actually about to lose a license or be sued, taxed, levied, if a single business was in any danger of any penalty, if someone was commanding LA government to penalize a buisness for such atleast we would have an actual problem.

Louisiana,36kvus,SkylineDriver,-5,Wed May 20 04:48:57 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, would a sign shop run by 2 gay men married to eachother be ok with the government forcing them to print signs that say ""God hates fags"" if the Westboro Baptist Church faxed them an order? I don't agree with most of this bill, but the last thing I want in my life is more government control. It's a double edged sword but no one appears to see the other side such as the example I just posted."
Louisiana,36kvus,Bunnyhat,5,Wed May 20 15:08:21 2015 UTC,"I love that example because legal experts have debunked it plenty of times publicly. Participating directly in hate speech is not required by any merchant. The most they'd be required to do is sell the supplies for them to do it if they sold supplies to everyone else.  You don't have to add new services to accommodate people, you only have to offer the services you already offer equally to all, granted if a customer is rude / mean / has payment issues / or is forcing hate speech you're exempt from that in every case I've seen."
Louisiana,36kvus,bugaboosql,4,Wed May 20 19:40:56 2015 UTC,"You are comparing two different things.  Someone turning down offensive content is not the same thing as someone turning down an entire group of people based on criteria (such as race, sex, and yes sexuallity)."
Louisiana,36kvus,Bunnyhat,-1,Thu May 21 01:30:58 2015 UTC,"So if a gay wedding offends someone,  then they do not have to make a cake.   So you seem to support this law?  They are not ""turning down an entire group""... Just not making ""content"" for one event."
Louisiana,36kvus,AdzyBoy,3,Thu May 21 14:21:21 2015 UTC,Keep reaching. A gay wedding cake is no different than a straight wedding cake. Turning down a wedding cake because someone is gay is turning down someone just because of who they are.  Now if they wanted a wedding cake with whips chains and a gaping anus on top them you ate turning it down because of the content.
Louisiana,36kvus,SkylineDriver,2,Thu May 21 14:58:20 2015 UTC,"Would these gay owners be printing signs saying ""God Hates Fags"" for anyone who asks for them except the WBC?"

My question remains, would two homosexuals be ok with the state forcing them to print those signs under the threat of fines or penalties? I think its ridiculous for the state to force them to do business with an organization who obviously hates them because of something so stupid."
Louisiana,36kvus,bugaboosql,2,Wed May 20 18:48:52 2015 UTC,"I meant that it wouldn't be discriminatory if they weren't printing that sign for other people. If they printed ""God Hates Fags"" for everyone except for a certain class of people, then it would be discriminatory."
Louisiana,36kvus,SkylineDriver,-1,Wed May 20 18:51:42 2015 UTC,Social contract is great.   Theft at gun point is different.     I want to be free and you want to dictate to everyone on how to act and think.   And I am the bad guy?   Sorry to offend you mr hitler.
Louisiana,36kvus,Bunnyhat,-5,Thu May 21 19:10:13 2015 UTC,"One more thing, and this is directed at LGBT people in particular. Why would you want to give your money to a business that has proven they don't agree with your lifestyle? The last thing I would want to do is hire that company. They wouldn't get a dime of my hard earned cash if they discriminated against my lifestyle, you can bank on that. Are you saying you want the government to FORCE a business to take your money after that business proclaims they don't like homosexuals?"
Louisiana,36kvus,bugaboosql,6,Wed May 20 15:10:16 2015 UTC,What if that's the only business that offers that service in your area? How about we just do the simple thing and treat everyone equally? It's really not that hard to do.
Louisiana,36kvus,bugaboosql,3,Wed May 20 19:42:20 2015 UTC,Exactly. There are more than a few towns in Louisiana where you might only have one place to shop. Or one bank. Or one of any number of businesses. I've driving through towns with just a single gas station.
Louisiana,36kvus,bugaboosql,2,Thu May 21 01:32:16 2015 UTC,All of which benefit from your local taxes from things as simple as roads and emergency services.
Louisiana,36kvus,bugaboosql,0,Thu May 21 01:59:36 2015 UTC,"I have a problem with this argument.  The government points a gun at you, takes your money.  Then when you try to make a life for yourself they make an excuse that you used public resources so we have to tax you more.   You really should try to run your own business.  It's almost impossible.  So the people on welfare get an $8000 tax refund without paying a dime in taxes plus $800 for themselves and each child per month in welfare.   They use the roads?    I see them at the bank every 1st of the month.  They hit the ATM at midnight to get the limit of $600 and then they are there at 9am in their Escalade with rims that cost more then my whole car.    But you want to tax me because I own a business.   After tax, expenses, food, and rent,  I have to use credit cards.   They get free food and free or reduced rent so they put hundreds of dollars in their pocket.    And still,  I am privileged.  BTW, they need money at midnight to go to the casino or buy drugs or party.   I pay for my use of roads and their entire lifestyle  [edit] spelling"

This one bank gives out $300,000 by noon on the 1st of the month.  There are two other banks in town.  I have to pay $4000 a year to send my child to private school. I can't afford it, but it's the only way.  Public school is a joke.  They don't teach, they baby sit.  High school is better than middle school.  Most of your ""poor"" kids have dropped out by then.

Louisiana,36kvus,calthopian,0,Fri May 22 18:36:16 2015 UTC,"What if its a really small town and they don't have a bakery?  Lets get the government to put a bakery there.    Apply that argument to other things and it fails.    Besides, you are acting like the LGBT community is 50% of the population.  It's actually under 3%.   So the probability is that there is no LGBT in that community or anywhere in it.   The politicians want more laws to increase their power, and you are getting in line to give it to them."
Louisiana,36kvus,bugaboosql,-10,Fri May 22 14:57:41 2015 UTC,"He did good.  You liberals are so dedicated to your cause that you forget about what is right and wrong.  To give someone else rights by taking away others rights is wrong.   President Clinton signed a similar law.  I'm guessing you supported it then.  The simple fact is that to force anyone to do anything is wrong.  If a business wants not allow blacks and gays in, let them, its their business.  They will be out of business soon.  I will stand in front of that store with you and we can picket together.  But they should have the right to do it.   If gays want to get married they should be able to get married.  No one, or no religion or church should be forced to marry them or bake them a cake.   Force is wrong."
Louisiana,36kvus,hhhnnnnnggggggg,7,Wed May 20 13:44:29 2015 UTC,"Clinton signed a very different one. Clinton's one only prevented the Government from messing with religious freedom, this one is to let businesses be able to do as they please and face no consequences, even if it's not a real belief or part of any religion.   No one is saying to force Churches to do anything, making LGBT citizens equal is not taking away anyone's rights, it is defending second class citizens and letting them have equal rights in the eyes of the law."
Louisiana,36kvus,bugaboosql,5,Wed May 20 13:53:35 2015 UTC,I thought  businesses  had the right to refuse service to anyone they want with no cause stated. When did this change?
Louisiana,36kvus,calthopian,3,Wed May 20 14:08:46 2015 UTC,"Think about it this way. If you run a privately owned hospital and you're the only one in the area (you get tons of money from tax payers keep that in mind) and you get someone in who is black and your ER Doctors say they don't want to treat a black guy, go find another hospital, then the patient dies as there wasn't enough time to get to another hospital.   Think that should be allowed?"
Louisiana,36kvus,bugaboosql,1 point,Wed May 20 14:19:21 2015 UTC,"That would suck. However, I think the stipulation  of accepting  tax dollars would revoke that right. Its kind of like if a person came to a Christian  hospital  and demanded an abortion. In that case I think it would be acceptable to refer them somwhere else."
Louisiana,36kvus,calthopian,2,Thu May 21 03:07:01 2015 UTC,"But what if the woman is in danger of dying unless they perform an emergency abortion and there is no time to get to a secular hospital? Does she just have to die? And before you say that doesn't happen, it does. Women die because Catholic Hospitals refuse to perform life saving abortions, and Catholic Hospitals take tax dollars."
Louisiana,36kvus,AdzyBoy,1 point,Thu May 21 04:18:46 2015 UTC,Damn! This topic has too many loop holes. The more i debate it the more i see you cant regulate these things.
Louisiana,36kvus,Tman972,2,Thu May 21 14:09:21 2015 UTC,"Which is exactly why making exemptions for religion is a bad idea. There's one law, your religion shouldn't give you an exemption from following it."
Louisiana,36kvus,bugaboosql,-5,Thu May 21 14:11:20 2015 UTC,That would make it government discrimination again.  The government should not be allowed to discriminate.  That's how you end up with slavery.  Private bakers and pizza shops are different.  They are private.  Think about this.  What if you have a black gay man painting pictures for money on the side walk?  I walk up to him and ask him to paint a picture of god striking down gay people and black people in chains.   According to YOU...  He MUST paint that picture for me.
Louisiana,36kvus,bugaboosql,6,Wed May 20 14:34:40 2015 UTC,How's it government if the hospital is privatized?
Louisiana,36kvus,bugaboosql,0,Wed May 20 16:49:17 2015 UTC,"(you get tons of money from tax payers keep that in mind)   /u/TibitXimer is trying to have his cake and eat it too.  A private hospital that gets tons of tax dollars?  Really?  We already have laws that hospitals must serve emergency patients.  That is really not the point.   You want to force a group of people to do something because the government forced them to NOT to do something.   Government uses martial status for multiple reasons,  mostly taxes.  There is no need for this.  If a Christian doesn't want to make a cake, fine.   If a LGBT doesn't want to make a cake for a straight couple, fine.   It is impossible to legislate a perfect society.  Let people be people.  You should be outraged at the government right now because they have defined marriage.   By asking the government to limit someone else (Christians) rights,  you are playing the politicians game of...  Pass the blame to someone else."
Louisiana,36kvus,bugaboosql,1 point,Wed May 20 18:32:30 2015 UTC,"You do know that basically every hospital in this country takes Medicare and Medicaid?   Anyway, you're confusing content discrimination with context discrimination. It's content discrimination to say I won't make that hate sign/painting/whatever because I don't make hateful things for anyone. It'd be context discrimination if you say I won't make that hate sign/painting/whatever for you because I don't serve your kind. The former is legal, Jindal just legalised the latter."

I know the colleges there make it a bit younger and more liberal but I didn't think to that extent."
Louisiana,36j726,NotHosaniMubarak,3,Tue May 19 22:02:32 2015 UTC,There has also been a lot of white flight.

Louisiana,3668uk,GeauxOU,5,Mon May 18 21:18:36 2015 UTC,It's called University of Louisiana Lafayette because it was a deal between them and Ulm when it was northwestern. ULL thinks it's so awesome that they get to be ul. But they never will.

I'll say Louisiana just to piss you off.  Go ahead and call us whatever you want. Not gonna hurt my feelings.

Louisiana,35ykyh,MyUserNameTaken,9,Thu May 14 16:22:57 2015 UTC,The project was started and paid for before the budget cuts were even a reality. The funds came from a student voted referendum for tuition increase that only allows the funds to be allocated towards the remodeling of the recreation center.   This renovation has nothing to do with state higher education budget cuts.
Louisiana,35ykyh,Terry_Crews,-11,Thu May 14 19:32:14 2015 UTC,I understand that.  But it looks bad.  Really bad.  This could easily be spun leaving that part and the part about it being separate funds that can not be touched out.
Louisiana,35ykyh,sheepcat87,12,Thu May 14 19:41:16 2015 UTC,"You can spin anything by leaving out relevant details. That's how we decide in this modern age which news agency is garbage and which isn't, by figuring out what they are leaving out and why."

Louisiana,35ykyh,Terry_Crews,8,Thu May 14 20:39:48 2015 UTC,"No, when the referendum was voted on the funds were specifically designated towards the remodeling of the recreation center. It would be like someone giving you money to buy a new couch and you putting that money towards your mortgage instead.   In fact all of LSU's architectural expansions are paid for through either university raised funds, private donations, or tuition."

Louisiana,35ykyh,ULalum06,-1,Fri May 15 11:43:08 2015 UTC,"So in a time of possibly going bankrupt, these funds can not be used for floating the academics as opposed to drunk frat boys? Doubtful.  I can almost guarantee you that given the choice students would rather a more enriched education, and for what it's looking like, an education at all.  I'm sure it wouldn't take long for a precedent to be found that moved general funds to an emergency fund to help alleviate the budget."

I understand the Pandora's box that could possibly be opened by moving these funds; however; the state of Louisiana and higher ed specifically have never been in such a state of emergency.  S&P has downgraded bonds across both lsu and UL systems. Again, from both a public and national stance this move, albeit funded with monies that came in before the budget cuts, does not bode well with most people."
Louisiana,35ykyh,petit_cochon,2,Fri May 15 14:20:35 2015 UTC,"The money was already raised and earmarked. Please remember that LSU wasn't always a bankrupt system due to Jindal; at some point it was actually a well-funded university. This is just blame-shifting propaganda. It's not LSU's fault that they're in a massive budget crisis - it's the fault of our government for cutting their funding and not generating needed revenue.

Sure, fuck the companies that don't claim responsibility for the damage they cause and do nothing to fix it. But as someone in the industry, not a single soul wants what happened in Deepwater Horizon to ever happen again. We are not evil for drilling for a very needed resource. What's evil is when companies take shortcuts that lead to disasters and do nothing to fix the damage they caused because of it. Fuck BP for telling the experts to shove it when they said 21 centralizers were needed to center the drill string in the bottom of the well in order to form a good cement job. 21 centralizers were needed; they only used 6. Fuck the people who allowed that to fly. Fuck the people who examined the cement composition and figured ""eh fuck it close enough."" Fuck BP for fucking up our fragile ecosystem and giving no fucks about it. But god bless the companies that are doing what they're supposed to do and abiding by USCG and BSEE regulations. Side note, I also find it funny how no one ever brings up how jack up rigs and some MODU's serve as great artificial reefs.  Trust me, I'm saying this as someone who would count down the days until my fishing trips in Point Aux Chenes as a kid and as an adult going to school to work in the industry. I love the wetlands and one day when I'm making that infamous oil field cash I plan on putting a large sum of that into coastal restoration every year. But to sit here and say fuck the oil companies while you drive your gas-driven vehicles and used your petroleum based products is a bit hypocritical, no? Global warming plays just as much of a role, if not more, in the loss of our wetlands. Indirect cause of oil companies, yes. But while you're pointing your finger at the oil companies, look in the mirror and realize that part, not all, blame falls on your (and mine too to be fair) shoulders too. And just to be clear, I'm not trying to single you out. What I'm saying applies to a lot of people.  Can someone please prove to me that there are people here who are capable of having adult conversations with people of different opinions besides usual brigades of ""FUCK YOU, YOU OIL INDUSTRY SCUM!!!"""
Louisiana,35oodo,ElmoTheRapist,2,Tue May 12 10:29:52 2015 UTC,"They profit from the environment while concealing the actual value of their industry. Instead of paying for the damage they cause, which would make an accurate accounting of the value they contribute, they use their grip on the energy sector and the economy to hold us hostage until newer, better forms of energy are available.   The idiocy is with a public who's confronted with the prospect of endless, free to access energy (solar  wind tidal etc) but finds drilling for dead organisms to require the least knowledge.  If you did not want it to happen again, you would invest your time and effort into these projects. But you can't and don't because all your eggs are in their polluting, environmentally/economically/geopolitically dangerous basket.   The public falsely pretends this is the cheaper alternative, glossing over the truth that we're passing the actual cost to later generations (who will have to clean up the mess we left) as just another of the disgusting problems that our descendents will have because this is the fattest, greediest, most senselessly selfish generation of humanity"

Who's to say we aren't? Alternative energy sources are a common discussion in my classes. Seriously. If I wanted to I can go into Moodle right now and take screenshots of a forum we were having in one of my classes discussing alternative energy sources and their viability. The general consensus was that, yes, these things will be our primary energy sources some day. When? Who knows. But they will be someday but it's probably going to be a while so for the ""in now"" we will continue to drill for oil because it's needed. Albeit as safely and as efficiently as possible--that's where we (my classmates and I) come in.   Regardless, I fail to understand how investing in other energy sources could have prevented Deepwater Horizon. I mean, I get it, but it's not going to happen overnight. How about in the meantime we stop letting these fucking idiots cut corners while drilling thousands of feet into our planet where very volatile gases and pressures exist?   But you can't and don't because all your eggs are in their polluting, environmentally/economically/geopolitically dangerous basket.   And that's where your wrong. I'm focusing in Safety Technology so even though I have a lot of interest in the oil industry, I can pretty much work any kind of safety professional job in any industry. Safety trainer, compliance officer, accident prevention, safety consultant, facility inspector, accident investigation. Hell, I could work directly for OSHA if I wanted to.

Louisiana,35nmnh,sn0wdizzle,12,Mon May 11 23:53:52 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, well... it's not gone gone, but let me paint the picture here for ya, as far I know.  The state is currently facing a $1.6 billion budget shortfall for this financial period (which will obviously need to be addressed for every year from here on out). At the moment, the latest development is that a $600 million revenue increase will be proposed (and supposedly passed) that will be taken from repealing inventory tax credits. Not exactly sure how those work, just that they will no longer be in place.  Therefore, that leaves an additional $1 billion that has to come from somewhere. LSU has received multiple budget cuts over the past 4 years, resulting in a continuously shrinking catalog of classes and faculty, mostly at the expense of the languages and arts departments (the humanities, so to speak). Tuition had also been climbing by about $500 a year since I was in school from '07 to '11. They also raised the standards to be TOPS eligible (it's the program that provides financial assistance for students, although I'm not familiar with most of it's intricacies since I went to High School in Texas), so only the highest achieving students in the state receive the dwindling resources. So, basically what I'm getting at is that the higher education system in Louisiana has pretty much been bled as much as it could be over the past 4-5 years. Any more cuts and you're looking at a loss to not only the humanities programs, but the flagship programs (Engineering, Business and Medicine). Realistically, I'd expect tuition to go up even more over the next 4 years.  The university isn't dead, but it's not exactly getting by at the moment. Personally, I don't think that the higher education system is going to collapse in Louisiana, simply because I believe that having your universities collapse would make the state the laughing stock of the nation, and I don't think even our somewhat inept leadership would allow that to happen. But, we currently have a governor that is trying very hard to appeal to (extremely) conservative voters, not only in the state, but around the nation in order to establish himself as a possible candidate for 2016. This has made progress slow and almost non-existent because no one wants to be the guy that raised taxes, or got rid of tax credits and somehow ended up hurting big business.  The university is still there. I don't think it's going anywhere, but it won't remain ""AS IS"" in the future. It'll definitely shrink, and smaller programs will probably continue to get cut."
Louisiana,35nmnh,El_Zorro09,2,Tue May 12 00:28:28 2015 UTC,"The ~$600 million passed the house appropriations committee, but still has to survive the house floor. The state senate is unlikely to pass the same budget bills, so the house version and the senate version will have to go to conference committee.  Even if the $600M makes it through all of those hurdles, the Governor may veto the funding, as it will include tax increases, which he has vowed will not occur during his administration. The house will likely lack the 2/3 majority to overturn such a veto if it occurs.  TL;DR No chickens are yet hatched, and LSU and the rest of higher ed could still go through massive cuts.

Louisiana,349rgr,high-powered-mutant,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:09:42 2015 UTC,"It has to do with the FDA standards for medicinal uses of marijuana. That's what the sheriffs/DA are basing their approval on, and as of yet, the FDA has not received or provided any data that shows smoking marijuana to be medically beneficial. My guess is that this is mainly because extractions, oils, butters, etc. have just as many, if not more applications that inhaled marijuana, but it could also be to keep everyone from turning medical marijuana into a joke because everyone is seeking prescriptions for any and all kinds of maladies (real or perceived) just so they can get high legally, kind of like what happened in California.   There is a complete legalization bill which is due in the house on MAY 6th at 9:30AM. Show up, sit in, and support and if you can, and pass the word along."

If you stay down south, you'll have to experience New Orleans so you can see what all the fuss is about. Up north, there isn't a lot of stuff a tourist would find interesting besides the whole Duck Commander shebang. Southern LA has much more of the wow factor. It's just a different place there. I, for one, find the old cemeteries to be amazingly beautiful. Either way, have fun and stay safe."

In Cajun, catin means ""doll"" and is often used as a term of endearment for a small child; in international French, it means a whore. In IF, dérangement means ""disruption, inconvenience, disturbance;"" in Cajun, it means the shits.  Now, French and Cajun French are not that different, and give or take a few odd looks, two such francophones would be able to understand each other.  I have Jules O. Daigle's book Cajun Self-Taught. It is a very good record of the Cajun French language, but I want to warn you of one thing. Rev. Daigle is very biased against the French language; at no point in the book does he ever call the language ""Cajun French."" He insists that French and Cajun are two distinct languages. He tries to distance Cajun from French by saying things like ""The Cajun language is no more a dialect of French than French is a dialect of Latin."" He also has an improper understanding of how languages work. He says,    For example, why should Cajuns trade the word ""typewriter"" for the misspelled and mispronounced Greek word ""dactylographe"", which is the French for typewriter or why should Cajuns use the French ""fermeture a crémaillière"" or ""fermeture a glissière"" for ""zipper"" when we have our very own American word? [bolded text is actually underlined]   And   The only difference is that when French ""borrows"" a foreign word, it usually misspells and mispronounces it. But, when Cajun ""borrows"" English words it keeps them intact, both as to spelling and mispronunciation.   And finally,   ENGLISH IS TO CAJUN WHAT LATIN IS TO FRENCH.   Another problem with the book is that it doesn't really....teach...well. I mean, you have to put in a lot of effort to get something out of it. His style is to just throw a bunch of words at you, give a few sample sentences, and then move on to the next batch of words. This is why I might be inclined to say that you maybe should associate yourself with how French works, because he rarely explains the actual grammatical mechanics of the language.  All that being said, it still works and it's the best that we got."

In 2009, in the aftermath of the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression, Jindal refused to accept tens of millions in federal economic stimulus funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the overwhelming majority of which was directed toward infrastructure projects. In 2010, following the passage of the landmark Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Jindal blocked billions in federal funding for Medicaid expansion, effectively shutting out more than 250,000 Louisiana citizens for accessing health insurance that would otherwise be available. He rejected millions in federal grant funding for the expansion of broadband in rural North and Central Louisiana and millions more for the construction of commuter rail between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. He squandered hundreds of millions in damages from BP in order to construct a series of sand berms, which had been roundly rejected as a feasible solution by geologists, marine biologists, and oceanographers and which dissipated back into the Gulf of Mexico almost as quickly as they were constructed. When Louisiana had the chance to recover billions in damages from the oil and gas industry for their negligence in coastal erosion and environmental degradation, many of those companies had been willing to settle; Jindal, however, championed legislation designed to completely immunize the industry from liability and eventually knocked the case out of court entirely."

Sure.  Do some oil companies cut corners?  Sure.  Does the environment around well pads suffer from spills and general refuse/pollution? Absolutely.  Does ANY of that change the ""safety"" level of fracking?  Not at all.  It is safe.

Louisiana,33l80u,bagofboards,2,Fri Apr 24 11:57:47 2015 UTC,"What you really have to understand about Biblical interpretation (and this is not saying that you are ignorant; plenty of Christians don't even get this.) is that the Bible is not meant to be interpreted or seen as one, cohesive work of literature. That's why we call them ""books"" of the Bible: they aren't all written the same. Some books contain psalms, others epics, still others accounts or letters. Therefore, it is very necessary to understand what the piece is. Also, it's very important in Biblical analysis (as with analysis of any form of literature) to know the context.  A Biblical literalist would say that everything in the Bible is to be taken literally; they represent a very small portion of Christians, and for good reason. Many parts of the Bible are not meant to be taken literally or must be viewed in context.  Context is what is necessary to understand Leviticus and other codes of Hebrew laws. The majority of the prescriptions and proscriptions contained in Leviticus are part of what is called the Ceremonial law. The Ceremonial law was established by God to remind the Israelites that they were the chosen people and that from them would come the Messiah. However, there also exists what is called the Moral law, exemplified in the Ten Commandments. These laws were to show men their sins so that they might grow closer to God.  Now, with the coming of Christ, the Ceremonial law of the Jews was no longer needed, but was fulfilled in Christ Jesus: for Christ himself said, ""Do not think that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets. I have come, not to abolish them, but to fulfill them."" (Mt 5:17) However, while the Ceremonial law was fulfilled, the Moral law still remains, because its purpose is still relevant to this day: to allow man to see the error in his ways, free himself from the bonds of sin, and follow the Lord.   You either buy the whole damn book or you don't[.] rare is the person who buys it all...'and if yee are lukewarm, i will spew you from my mouth' ...pretty straightforward there, isn't it[?]   ""Buys it all"" and ""buy the whole damn book"" implies a literalist method of interpretation, which is not only wrong: it is plain dangerous."

The right-wing should band together to follow my lead and support lawmakers who share these beliefs, because they are feeling pressure from corporations to follow the left-wing agenda.  Overstated conviction will not win him favor over time, no matter how eloquently he phrases it. Turning away gay people is discrimination, and the younger Republican base is slowly following that thought path.

No.  It kind of makes sense the left would be more vocal about this. It's perfectly logical.

Louisiana progressives consistently show piss poor judgement and elect people who end up in federal prison. The same people get butthurt daily about things like paintings of Bobby Jindal or someone mentioning Jesus.

So is our music and language. Stay at The Blue Moon Saloon and Guesthouse, there is usually some great cajun or local music on the back porch and you can get great food nearby, it's also cheap to stay there. Lafayette is the capital city of what we call Acadiana, the french Cajun part of Louisiana, the small towns around it are more traditional/authentic, so you can visit them to. Take a swamp tour, by kayak if you're brave, then dance and eat too much. PM me for recommendations.  And fuck Baton Rouge, it's a boring college city. The old state Capitol is beautiful (Google it) and just off the interstate, so a quick stop is cool.

Acadian Village, Vermilionville, canoeing/kayaking at Lake Martin, FESTIVAL, etc. There's good nightlife as well,  many options. I recommend Blue Moon Saloon (a hostel/bar/music venue) that has great local acts and a cool crowd.   Avery Island is phenomenal. It's just past Lafayette and you can visit the Tabasco factory. I go once a year minimum and I'm from here. Avery Island itself is home to the Tabasco pepper fields and you can drive through Avery Island for a fee, like $7 per person maybe. It's chock full of beautiful oaks, cypress trees, turtles, big alligators every where, botanical gardens, places to picnic, etc. The area by the sitting Buddha/pond is gorgeous and if you walk behind it, there's a trail the goes into the woods among the bamboo fields that are so serene.

Just view this link  from google and read the reviews. Don't do the swamp tours. Not worth it if you ask me. But you may see some thing you never have seen. Food is king in this area.

Louisiana,32udfn,JayEmBosch,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:01:42 2015 UTC,"A blanket of fog lifts, exposing a band of rainbow sheen that stretches for miles off the coast of Louisiana. From the vantage point of an airplane, it's easy to see gas bubbles in the slick that mark the spot where an oil platform toppled during a 2004 hurricane, triggering what might be the longest-running commercial oil spill ever to pollute the Gulf of Mexico.  Yet more than a decade after crude started leaking at the site formerly operated by Taylor Energy Company, few people even know of its existence. The company has downplayed the leak's extent and environmental impact, likening it to scores of minor spills and natural seeps the Gulf routinely absorbs.  An Associated Press investigation has revealed evidence that the spill is far worse than what Taylor — or the government — have publicly reported during their secretive, and costly, effort to halt the leak. Presented with AP's findings, that the sheen recently averaged about 91 gallons of oil per day across eight square miles, the Coast Guard provided a new leak estimate that is about 20 times greater than one recently touted by the company.  Outside experts say the spill could be even worse — possibly one of the largest ever in the Gulf.   Secrecy shrouds decade-old oil spill in Gulf of Mexico   Down to just one full-time employee, Taylor Energy Company exists for only one reason: to fight an oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico that has gone largely unnoticed, despite creating miles-long slicks for more than a decade.  The New Orleans-based company has downplayed the leak’s environmental impact, likening it to scores of minor spills and natural seeps that the Gulf routinely absorbs.  But an Associated Press investigation has revealed evidence that the spill is far worse than what Taylor — or the government — has publicly reported. Presented with AP’s findings, the Coast Guard provided a new leak estimate that is about 20 times greater than one recently touted by the company.  Outside experts say the spill could be even worse — possibly one of the largest ever in the Gulf, albeit still dwarfed by BP’s massive 2010 gusher.  The roots of the leak lie in an underwater mudslide triggered by Hurricane Ivan’s waves in September 2004. That toppled Taylor’s platform and buried 28 wells under sediment about 10 miles off Louisiana’s coast at a depth of roughly 475 feet. Without access to the buried wells, traditional “plug and abandon” efforts wouldn’t work."

Coypus were introduced to the Louisiana ecosystem in the 1930s, when they escaped from fur farms that had imported them from South America.[26] Damage in Louisiana has been sufficiently severe since the 1950s to warrant legislative attention; in 1958, the first bounty was placed on nutria, though this effort was not funded.[27]:3 By the early 2000s, the Coastwide Nutria Control Program (CNCP) was established, which began paying bounties for nutria killed in 2002.[27]:19–20 In the Chesapeake Bay region in Maryland, where they were introduced in the 1940s, coypus are believed to have destroyed 7,000 to 8,000 acres (2,800 to 3,200 ha) of marshland in the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge.

I am happy to see that in this case when this officer lied he was punished.  The process worked in this case.  There are examples where it has not seemed to work in the past but not in this case.  I also don't think that your statement that >Pigs always lie.  is accurate because I don't think swine can speak at least not to me.  And even if they did I would prefer not to have intercourse with swine.  I will leave that to you if it is your thing and won't judge.   Now if your comment was using the slang term pigs to mean law enforcement officers then I still do not think your statement is true. I find it very hard to believe that there are no law enforcement officers in all of history that have never spoken a true statement.  Regardless I still do not wish to have intercourse with law enforcement officers either as I am not currently married to one.

Not a matter of my yankeeness, I love the South more than I do the North, but I don't understand why it is so hard for Jindal to understand a general principle. You open a business, you open it to everyone in the neighborhood, city, parish, state, and country (unless it is akin to a private golf course). I mean shit, we are already broke as hell, this is the type of thing that is idiotic because if we cant depend on oil revenues, we can at least depend on revenues from our tourism industry. This type of legislation will cause people not to come to our state. As a governor who proclaims to be pro business, well, the most pro business thing you can do is open your door to everyone to attain more revenue and profits. Also, if New Orleans is proclaiming itself to be the new Hollywood seeing how we offer a ton of tax revenue subsidies to get filming here, out of all the people in the country, you really expect hollywood and the executives there to be okay with this type of legislation?  Regarding the whole 1st Amendment Issue. The first and fourteenth amendment doesnt tolerate discrimination against people for their beliefs, the first amendment is there to protect people's beliefs. There is a fundamental difference. You are free to think what you want and you can think about what you want in church and practice what you want. The government isnt there to advocate your religious beliefs and to shut down people who think differently from you through denying an opportunity to spend money in the open market place. You cant tax a church, set up dumb regulations that thrawt one's beliefs, but I still havent read any argument that demonstrates how exactly this legislation (or lackthereof) actually hinders one's ability to practice one's religion. I simply believe you cannot put religion in the marketplace.  That is why there is a separation of church and state because once the government gets in the business of deciding what is appropriate behavior in terms of dictating one's beliefs in the realms of religion (I am a devout christian), it really sets a troubling and quite frankly unamerican and unconstitutional precedent."

In my opinion, this means that any discrimination based on one's belief about a married LBGT couple is perfectly okay! All you have to do is say. LBGT married couple came in, didnt like them because I knew they were a LBGT married couple, kick them out and refused them service. This, as it appears, is what the bill would allow.  This effectively allows one's thoughts about a gay married couple and denial of that couple okay just because the state cannot sue because it would go against the discriminator's conscience."

It is that some business owners will. You can have whatever thoughts you have on LBGT marriage and the sanctity of marriage, whatever your believe in your heart, mind, and soul in terms of the church is okay, this I have no disagreement over. The problem is that there are going to be some business owners that are going to deny a gay married couple their business just because that couple is gay. Say what you want, that is a form of discrimination.   The problem I have is that the First Amendment wasnt created to effectively discriminate against people. What this bill effectively did would be a prime example of double speak from 1984.  If there is an amendment that I hold closest to my heart, mind, and soul, it is the First, (then 2nd, 14th, 4th, 5th, 10th.....) The problem in this legislation is that in the guise of the first amendment, you can effectively discriminate against an LBGT couple. Believe and have faith in what you want in church. If a church doesnt want to allow gay couples to wed in their doors, that is fine and if this bill was created for that, and i would be okay with. Govt shouldnt dictate that or force a church into doing that. It is the actions outside of church, in the marketplace, where one's thoughts becomes discriminatory is where I have the problem.   I firmly believe this is a bad example of legislative writing where protecting an important right has unintended consequences in the form of discrimination. The legislature just needs to spend more time and effectively write the proper legislation where you can safeguard religion and not allow for discrimination in the marketplace."

Its roughly in the middle of the state, a few mikes north of ville platte. Also if memory serves, tent camping with electrical service is around $15/night. The primitive spots, some of which are miles down the trails and far more beautiful, are cheaper I think. The trail can be accessed at multiple points so you don't have to do all 22 miles in one go. You can take it in sections. You can also rent canoes, And I believe they are having some sort of festival there this weekend."

Louisiana has some of the best mushroom foraging opportunities in the States.  When the oysters start to slow down in the spring time, it's time to start targeting chanterelles.

You can also just get a good field guide and go spend some time in the woods.  I recommend this one, though it is sorely out of date.  Identifying mushrooms takes time to learn, and even more time to become confident enough to eat what you've identified, but once you get there, it's a lot of fun.  Given the timing, a good species to start with is the chanterelle.  We have several different species in Louisiana, and each of them is delicious.  They're also fairly easy to identify.  In roughly a month, the hardwood bottomlands of Louisiana will be littered with them.  Get a WMA pass through LDWF, a good snake stick, and you should be set."

A couple months ago it came back bigger. Looked like a big furry tooth. Determined it was a lions mane mushroom. A few websites say it was a fool proof mushroom.

Take the back road routes on your drive and stop at mom and pop gas stations. I have eaten some or the best crawfish pistolettes and jambalaya bowls from gas stations. The best advice I can give you is don't judge a book by its cover some crappy looking sheet metal buildings usually have someone's grandmother cooking in the kitchen in the back. They are typically the best places to eat.  Edit: Also Google plate lunch places along your route. Typically $5-$10 these are sometimes done as fundraisers in small towns to raise money for certain causes. This is typically the closest you get to authentic homemade cajun cooking.

Louisiana,31os8m,petit_cochon,3,Tue Apr 7 12:52:24 2015 UTC,"Not sure about free, because mental health has been pretty gutted in this state, but:   if he's unemployed or low-income, he qualifies for assistance under the Affordable Care Act that would cut his insurance costs to a very low rate, maybe about $20 a month. From there, all plans are now required to offer comparable mental health services, so he could end up paying a very low or nonexistent copay. I honestly think getting him insured is the best option, and if he requires more immediate care, that can be addressed too.  Many therapists charge on a sliding scale, so it never hurts to ask around.  Who he needs depends on his issues; most therapists do specialize in certain areas."
Louisiana,31os8m,ChrisDeg87,0,Tue Apr 7 01:24:49 2015 UTC,If he is unemployed or low-income the last thing I would do is have him sign up for the ACA.  As mentioned many therapists charge on a sliding scale and will work with you.  But if you have insurance they will be forced to file with that insurance.  So unless your brother has the 6000 to cover the annual deductible that goes with the 20 per month plan I would stay away.  Source: My daughter has been screwed over by that situation.
Louisiana,31os8m,petit_cochon,1 point,Tue Apr 7 13:27:38 2015 UTC,"Certain services are covered without meeting the deductible...I don't know what insurance your daughter got, but there are many plans under the ACA. Some have high deductibles, others have lower ones. Look for ones with no co-pay for mental services.   He'll have to sign up anyway or get penalized. Doing it now just allows him to take advantage of subsidies reserved for the low-income."
Louisiana,31os8m,ChrisDeg87,0,Tue Apr 7 14:05:42 2015 UTC,Yes but the penalty is a few bucks for low income people as opposed to the high deductible and/or high policy cost.   If he were to go with ACA plans his choice is big cost to policy that you may get back as a credit with a low deductible or low cost policy with big deductible.   (or theoretically medium cost for both)  If we are talking about a person with little money none of these is really an option.  But on the bright side he would be covered for all of his pregnancies and prenatal care.

Louisiana,31mrns,gAlienLifeform,4,Mon Apr 6 14:45:39 2015 UTC,"Here's the issue with capital punishment in Louisiana: prosecutors from the Attorney General's office on down seem to know it's a waste of energy and resources to sentence someone to death row and litigate the case for twenty more years. There's no political will to change our laws so actual executions are more frequent (Texas for example requires state appeals and federal habeas corpus proceedings to happen at the same time). However, no one wants to get out in front of repealing the death penalty because it is still politically popular here. The last execution in Louisiana was in 2010 and that was only because the defendant waived all appeals. The previous one before that was way back in 2002.   Local District Attorney's offices (with the apparent exception of Caddo Parish) know it isn't worth the trouble to litigate a case forever. A capital defendant gets much better attorneys and will run prosecutors into the ground with pretrial motions and eventual appeals. The Assistant DAs I know won't take death off the table if the family absolutely insists (political reasons), but they warn families that a death sentence will drag on their grief for 20 plus years and make it more difficult to get closure.   Hope these Caddo prosecutors have fun answering appeals for the next few decades. They really are doing a disservice to the taxpayers and families of the victims."
Louisiana,31mrns,withmybearhands1947,2,Mon Apr 6 18:38:38 2015 UTC,"I had read an article a few months back that said that, despite the remarkable decline in crime since the early 1990s, prisons continued to swell until about 2009 (when their populations starting ebbing, slowly).  Most frequently mandatory minimums for drugs sentencing, and three strikes laws are blamed, but there's not a heck of a lot of statistical evidence to back that up.   What the researchers found was that, starting in the 1980s to the early 1990s, when presented with a suspect arrested for a crime, the DA would pursue a felony charge (instead of a misdemeanor) roughly 1/3 of the time. However, from about 1992 to present, DA's have increased their tendency to pursue felony charges to about 2/3 of the time.  So, despite declining arrests AND crimes, prison populations continued to increase until around 2009, when two things shifted:   Kids born after 1996 started hitting their teenage years. The 'post-millenials' are the least crime-prone of any generation the US has seen in at least 70 years. They're responsible for a huge part of a second massive drop in crime District attorneys  started (and only barely) dialing back the ""lock-them-up-and-throw-away-the-key"" talk   Also of note: James Gill is a very conservative Advocate columnist."

Louisiana,31hjwx,Goblin-Dick-Smasher,7,Sun Apr 5 15:23:08 2015 UTC,"That's an incredibly narrow-minded viewpoint. You are saying that this openly gay student should put effort into finding a loophole to a discriminating rule instead of standing up for herself and making ""an issue"" of it. The administrators and teachers are openly talking about how the student is a sinner and how they are only attempting to have an event where girls dress like girls and boys dress like boys, because that's ""how it is"".

I feel as though I'm cross-dressing if I put on women's clothing. If I come across a situation where they would require me to cross-dress, I simply would not attend. It's not a matter of what sexual organs I possess, it is a matter of what gender my brain says that I identify with. Period.  I don't know the girl in the article, although she lives in the next town from me, so I don't know if she identifies as male or female or andro. However, if she would rather not attend the prom rather than have to cross-dress that means that she is not simply ""rebelling"" against some ""dress code"".

She has quite a few options that she could have taken in talking with the principal to come up with alternatives to the ""girls can't wear tuxedos"" rule.  From the article it is pretty obvious the school board is willing to work with her and as the article stated it's probably a non-issue now.  However, I do understand what you mean about how you feel when you wear women's clothing.  I have worked with and have friends that are transgender and they felt that way about wearing men's clothing. Heck, they felt that way about being in their own skin.

I took a picture of a kid once who was holding a baseball bat threatening to beat a homeless man who was minding his own business on the street corner on the side of franks. Quite a few other times I've witnessed hoodlums try to threaten patrons and get a dose of street justice.  Before it moved Tony Chachere's Creole Foods was located in a neighborhood not far from downtown, while there I witnessed one mugging right out side the front door on a rainy monday at 12 noon, one bullet fly through the exterior wall through a hallway and lodge into the interior wall, one bullet blast out the back windshield of a parked car, one brick blast out the side window of a parked car and a storage shed intentionally set on fire burning it to the ground."

I think you could sway a good number of conservatives on an economic standpoint if you pointed out our budget, the fact that we pay ~$20k/year/inmate, and have the highest per-capita number of people in prison. Is it worth $100,000 to you to put a guy in prison for having a bit of pot? How about $400,000 for a third offense?

Louisiana,30v1ky,General_Hide,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:23:18 2015 UTC,"Just a year or two ago Austin Badon tried to introduce a bill that would do exactly that; lessen the penalties for those caught with small amounts of marijuana. His argument was that it would save the state money by not having to jail non violent offenders, and that seems like kind of rational conservative politians would vote for. Unfortunately that bill went nowhere. Some politicians minds may have changed since Colorado has proved that you could create a hundred million dollar industry overnight by changing a law, but I sill feel that Louisiana is committed to an archaic approach to the war on drugs. Any lessening of drug penalties in Louisiana would be a surprise to me."

And blaming Obama again. So what the fuck do they want then? If we produce more oil the price goes down, and its Obamas fault for ruining state budgets that relied on expensive oil. If we produce less and the price goes up its Obamas fault and he's anti-oil.   You would think that more local oil, cheaper oil, less foreign oil, would all be good things. But apparently not when a Democrat makes it happen. I guess Jindal and other governors want a president who will still produce more oil but then install artificial price controls so that it stays expensive? Because small government?"

The amount of drilling on federal lands has been declining during Obama's presidency.   Also, the drop in oil prices isn't purely due to increases in US production.

In his mind, if the state isn't paying for the university, it should at least have autonomy.   Note: they'll be fees, not tuition. TOPS is tied to LSU tuition, so LSU tuition increases automatically increase the amount Louisiana spends on TOPS. LSU fees, however, are not paid by TOPS."

Louisiana,2zrbcz,emkay99,2,Sat Mar 21 11:42:15 2015 UTC,"Dunno if the old voters out number the young voters   They pretty much do everywhere, but especially in the Olde South. And I've heard about Guillory's position but for now he's still very much an outlier. He's looking for something that will differentiate him from the crowd and mobilize potential voters who otherwise wouldn't bother. I'm his age, by the way, and I support legalization, too -- but that's not the usual position of older voters in this state (or any other)."
Louisiana,2zrbcz,dirtyredog,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:33:25 2015 UTC,"that's not the usual position of older voters    Right, and certainly not the sherrif's associations whose influence is quite broad. But when places like Florida get 58% on their MMJ ballot it makes me think there has been a radical shift in the opinions of the elderly vote."
Louisiana,2zrbcz,emkay99,2,Wed Mar 25 19:47:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think of myself as ""elderly"" -- except when it serves my purpose, like to get a better seat -- and even though I do use a cane these days. The thing is, though, I've been a lefty all my life, since I was a volunteer in the JFK campaign as a high school senior. My opinions on legal pot really haven't changed since the '60s.  Which is why I don't think it's going to happen in most Southern states for some time yet. Voters my age aren't going to be changing their minds. They're mostly socially conservative now because (this being the South) they were socially conservative when they were younger. I really don't thing there's a ""radical shift"" in their opinions. It's just that the current oldest tier of voters is being gradually, and naturally, replaced by the next-oldest tier.  That's mostly how things change in this country. The younger generation(s) of voters will have different opinions about many issues than the voters that came just before them. You just have to be patient. I had to learn that lesson myself, and so have we all. Each youngest generation, over time, never has learned it, of course."
Louisiana,2zrbcz,dirtyredog,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:58:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think of myself as ""elderly""    Err, sorry I meant no offense but the Florida electorate is older than the U.S. average so I thought it made a good example to highlight the older vote of a conservative state(albeit perhaps not your traditional southern conservative state and this is likely where my opinion is overly hopeful if indeed wrong).   I'm going to guess that Louisiana gets 54% yay on legalization if it hits the ballot in '16 but I've been hanging out with old bar rats not old church goers."
Louisiana,2zrbcz,emkay99,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:09:14 2015 UTC,"In my experience, only the Florida panhandle is typical of the South in general. Orlando and St. Pete are quite different.

Louisiana,2zrbcz,dirtyredog,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:09:36 2015 UTC,"That's probably because they're arguing over where the money would go. Elbert Guillory, our senator, wants to use the money to pay down the retirement debt liability:    Louisiana State Senator Elbert Guillory visited NewsTalk 96.5 KPEL yesterday and discussed a bill he has pre-filed with Ken Romero and Dr. John Sutherlin.  We started our discussion by asking if it was true that he had pre-filed a bill for the upcoming Louisiana Legislative session that would dedicate taxes from marijuana sales to bail out the state.  Guillory replied,   That is absolutely correct.  The state has about a $20 billion unfunded accrued liability.  $20 billion that we owe in our retirement systems.  So I’ve been looking for the last couple of years for a revenue stream and I’ve found it.  I read where the Governor said that he is not in opposition to medical marijuana so marijuana in any form, if you legalize it in any form, and I’m not pro, I’m not anti.  What I want, if you’re going to do it there’s going to be some money made from it and I want at least half of that money go into the retirement systems to pay down that debt.   Dr. Sutherlin asked if Senator Guillory expected controversy over his bill and Guillory said,   I really don’t expect this bill to be controversial.  It’s a good, responsible fiscally sound bill.  We need to put money into those retirement systems to make them stronger, more robust.   Concerning his motive for pre-filing this bill Senator Guillory said,   We have done a disservice to our retirees.  We’ve done a disservice to our retirement system by spending money over the last 20 years in an irresponsible fashion.  It’s time for us take some responsible steps."
Louisiana,2zrbcz,br00tman,1 point,Sat Mar 21 18:58:48 2015 UTC,"If this would pass, it'd really open up a lot of doors for Louisiana. Similar to how legalized gambling led to a tourism boom in Lake Charles, legalizing MJ would allow tourism from nearby states who aren't up to standards yet. And we've always been an agricultural state, and lots of previous farm land is now either solely for rice and crawfish or not used at all. This would offer our farmers another major cash crop, and the taxes could be used for things like fixing our bridges or building new schools. Maybe we could finally end our dependence on the oil industry if there were actually other ways to make a lucrative career than working your way up the oil ladder. Our prisons would be less crowded, and we might finally cease be the most incarcerating state on the planet.   I'm hopeful, folks, and if feels gooood."

If he had it, that would have paid for the damages.  I would recommend having uninsured/underinsured added to your policy.  For medical, I'm less sure, as I don't know what is covered by medical insurance and what is covered by the medical part of auto insurance.    If you aren't sure, sit down and talk with someone who works for your insurance agent.  They should be able to walk you through what you are covered for, what you aren't, and should be able to answer questions like this.  When my wife and I sat down with our insurance agent, we found a gap in the coverage we had for my wife's engagement ring, and were able to get it covered under a personal articles policy.

Louisiana,2zfo9z,AdzyBoy,2,Fri Apr 24 02:16:42 2015 UTC,"I'm from the Jambalaya Capital of the World, actually.  ...But I would like to try it."
Louisiana,2zfo9z,ConfusedDuck,17,Fri Apr 24 02:44:41 2015 UTC,"Depending on when it is, it will be FUCKING HOT. Besides that, nah you good"
Louisiana,2zfo9z,SanFransicko,14,Wed Mar 18 05:39:39 2015 UTC,You will appreciate Gold Bond powder on your nether regions.  This is my standard advice for people visiting our state for the first time.  Have fun and I wish you a dry ass.

Louisiana,2zfo9z,SundayDrinker,1 point,Wed Mar 18 14:31:51 2015 UTC,I second this!
Louisiana,2zfo9z,tree-flip,11,Wed Mar 18 13:21:26 2015 UTC,Lots of drinking. Is she catholic? We have a lot of Catholic weddings and they are extremely long. There will be plenty of food and most likely a lot of heat.
Louisiana,2zfo9z,Undesired_Username,11,Wed Mar 18 09:34:02 2015 UTC,"Expect social drinking, open bar is a VERY good sign. South Louisiana is known for lots of social drinking. Not white girl wasted but a healthy buzz with friends is what you can expect of some people, others may drink lightly or not at all.  If there is no alcohol expect religious in-laws and/or socially conservative country folk. Not saying it's a bad thing, but I'm calling it as I sees it.  Alcohol or not, expect good food, lots of ""yalls"", and expect to be asked if you incorrectly call soft drinks ""pop""."
Louisiana,2zfo9z,DrScarecrow,10,Wed Mar 18 12:30:35 2015 UTC,Is this an outdoor wedding? Be prepared to sweat.
Louisiana,2zfo9z,brokenvader,5,Wed Mar 18 10:19:05 2015 UTC,"Bring cash for the money dance! Season your liver from now until the wedding. If you can't handle the spicy food, butter your lips and drink milk. Put comfy insoles in your dancing shoes."
Louisiana,2zfo9z,Freeside1,1 point,Wed Mar 18 15:13:06 2015 UTC,"This is the biggest logistical difference, the money dance.  Basically, you pay $5+ in cash for a dance with the bride or groom. It's a way to get to spend some one on one time with them to chit chat while also giving them a little extra for their new life together or honeymoon."
Louisiana,2zfo9z,petit_cochon,5,Wed Mar 18 17:10:33 2015 UTC,What kind of Canadian? (narrows eyes)
Louisiana,2zfo9z,petit_cochon,4,Wed Mar 18 13:57:59 2015 UTC,French Canadian
Louisiana,2zfo9z,mechiah,10,Wed Mar 18 14:07:51 2015 UTC,That's what I thought.  You'll enjoy Louisiana.

Louisiana,2zfo9z,SoyBotones,3,Wed Mar 18 15:03:28 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean that it was similar, merely that the food will be good, people are friendly, and we tend to like people with accents. It's exotic, it's cool."

Louisiana,2zfo9z,Tactica1Panda,5,Wed Mar 18 16:25:57 2015 UTC,"If she's from South Louisiana, there may be at least one Swamp Pop song. If she's from south of I-12, there may be a Swamp Pop band at the reception."
Louisiana,2zfo9z,Tactica1Panda,2,Wed Mar 18 12:13:08 2015 UTC,"South of 90, there will be at least one live alligator in attendance"
Louisiana,2zfo9z,mojoronomous,3,Wed Mar 18 17:45:35 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what part of the state your going into.  The more ""Cajun"" an area is the closer to Canada you'll feel, Creole is the language spoken by Cajuns and is a dialect of french.  No matter where you go though, There will be alcohol, guns, large trucks, and lots of music playing (especially if there is a festival).  People here are usually polite and ""nice"" but there are also some huge assholes that try to compensate for something.  Louisiana is an amalgamation of the states around it in the northern part, but the further south you go (away from major cities) the further back in time you go, and the closer you get to ""traditional Acadian life"" that was founded by the French settlers. As examples, hunting from the land, speech, and living style.  Louisiana and Canada share our founding ancestors the Acaidians, so a lot of parts are going like what I'd imagine Canada to be like with guns and to much heat.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadians  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Louisiana  http://www.myneworleans.com/Louisiana-Life/"
Louisiana,2zfo9z,absolutspacegirl,3,Wed Mar 18 21:34:08 2015 UTC,"Cajun French and Louisiana Creole French are different. Creole mixes colonial Louisiana French (français cadien) with Spanish, African language (like the word gumbo), and Native American (Choctaw).   We speak Cajun French here."
Louisiana,2zfo9z,KeepCalmAndNikon,2,Thu Mar 19 18:05:32 2015 UTC,TIL
Louisiana,2zfo9z,bruce656,5,Thu Mar 19 22:40:30 2015 UTC,"Does her family speak Cajun French?   If so, be sure to compliment her family on her delicious turtle soup, or how soft and delicate her fruit-filled pastries are.  Edit: I take it that the downvotes are an indication that nobody here is a fan of backwoods Cajun French coonassery?"
Louisiana,2zfo9z,KeepCalmAndNikon,2,Wed Mar 18 14:45:47 2015 UTC,Where is she from in LA? When is the wedding?  These are important questions.
Louisiana,2zfo9z,peepea,3,Wed Mar 18 13:51:59 2015 UTC,"Lafayette, beginning of may."
Louisiana,2zfo9z,CajunBuckeye,6,Wed Mar 18 14:09:08 2015 UTC,"Bless your heart .. If that wedding is outside it's gonna be hot and muggy as hell..  If it's inside it still may be hot if no one man's the ac properly.   I was raised in Lafayette :) expect good food, funny stories, and in laws dancing till you about pee yourself laughing...  Tears all around."
Louisiana,2zfo9z,Kancho_Ninja,2,Wed Mar 18 14:30:49 2015 UTC,Surely no one would be foolish enough to have an outdoor wedding in May in South Louisiana.
Louisiana,2zfo9z,SoyBotones,4,Wed Mar 18 14:44:12 2015 UTC,"I've been to several native Louisiana outdoor weddings in may/june/and July...  Some people... They just wanna watch the world sweat.   Depending on the family, expect at least one round of the electric slide."
Louisiana,2zfo9z,bruce656,2,Wed Mar 18 14:50:52 2015 UTC,"Someone mentioned the money dance already. I saw that you said it's common to get gifts that cost $100+, but here I am guessing the price would mostly depend on how well you know the couple. As for cultural differences, there isn't really any strange traditions. Vow, eat, drink, and dance are the norm. The people you will meet will be overly friendly, and want you to drink. I've been to only one wedding that wasn't open bar, but I've been to a couple that was BYOB. I think you will be fine."
Louisiana,2zfo9z,Kancho_Ninja,4,Fri Mar 20 03:02:38 2015 UTC,Wear a seersucker suit!  These are pretty popular (again) down here.
Louisiana,2zfo9z,bruce656,4,Wed Mar 18 12:28:06 2015 UTC,"People think you jest, but I've seen three in the last few weeks.  Excluding last week. Last week sucked."

Louisiana,2zenyz,thatgibbyguy,7,Wed Mar 18 00:38:06 2015 UTC,"""north"" Louisianian here from Lincoln/Claiborne area mostly. Winn parish is a very strange place. People are born, live, and die in that parish, and they don't seem to do much else.  A fucking silent hill movie could be made on that place, and they wouldn't need to add much hollywood to make it a blockbuster.  *Edited for friends privacy* much bullshit has happened involving law enforcement in that parish with friends on two occasions.   I have family in law enforcement, and I am proud to say it.. But fuck we have some bullies in this state... Sucks that everyone loves for profit prisons.... I've always thought the idea of was majorly fucked .  Chances are, they are going to sentence him for some bullshit long ass time, and it will become a big deal..  Winn parish tried to secede once. The people that come out of that area are CRAZY as hell."

Louisiana,2zdvqb,BlankVerse,7,Tue Mar 17 19:41:34 2015 UTC,"The amount of dick sucking that Republicans do for Grover Norquist is amazing. We're slashing schools and hospitals but King Grover says we can't raise taxes so education and healthcare are just fucked.   I don't smoke but this cigarette tax idea is stupid and still doesn't raise enough money. Just fucking raise taxes already. I'll gladly pay more if it means we have a more healthy and educated populace and nice roads. It's obvious the Republicans don't give a fuck about those things though. We should raise taxes and call it the ""Freedom Patriot Gun Jesus Abstinence Intelligent Design Tax"". People in this state would vote for that shit.   When I lived in Texas I HATED Rick Perry but coming back home...it's just so depressing what Jindal has done. At least Perry cared about his state. I never thought I'd say I missed Texas but Jindal is making me miss Texas. He just does not give a fuck about the people of Louisiana, only his White House dreams that will never come true."
