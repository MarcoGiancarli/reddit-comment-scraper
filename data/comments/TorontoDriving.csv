They're both turning into the same lane; S141(5) only applies if there was a collision had the cammer went straight through; S141(5) does not give cammer right of way at the intersection.

No law enforcement would lay the charge; no prosecutor would proceed to trial; no learned justice would convict the driver.   There is no reasonable prospect to get a conviction, because S141(9) gives long vehicles an exemption."

TorontoDriving,3dkkg3,manoeuvre44,4,Fri Jul 17 18:13:22 2015 UTC,I've shown that repeatedly in this thread.  Left turners have to yield to everyone. Right turners (on green) have to yield only to pedestrians.

TorontoDriving,3dkkg3,Banana_Shits,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:40:50 2015 UTC,"/u/Banana_Shits my mistake; you're correct here, it appears someone tried to make my argument and failed.  ""path"" is not defined in the Highway Traffic Act, the JP decided to open a dictionary where it's defined as ""the course along which a person or thing moves or travels"".  Barrie (City of) v. Aleem, 2006 ONCJ 131 (CanLII)   [3]                       The facts are straightforward.  A truck driven by Leslie Darlow was proceeding south on Highway 26 just north of Barrie.  The appellant was stopped in one of the northbound lanes of Highway 26.  He made a left turn and struck the driver’s side of the Darlow truck.  The point of impact on the Darlow vehicle was at the driver’s side door.  The collision occurred at the intersection of Highways 26 and 27.  [7]                       Clearly, the path of a vehicle includes the area where it has been, where it currently is and where it is going.  Therefore, a vehicle turning left that collides with one side of an oncoming vehicle has entered into the path of that vehicle.  The entering of the path can occur in front of the approaching vehicle or into the side of it.   R. v. Hamid, 2008 ONCJ 246 (CanLII)   [147]   Thus, after a review of the wording in s. 141(5) and s. 142(1) of the H.T.A., it appears that both sections provide virtually the same rule or impose the same duty on drivers intending to make left turns in an intersection across the path of approaching vehicles, to do so in safety or to afford the approaching vehicle a reasonable opportunity to avoid a collision.  Although the prerequisite condition imposed on drivers intending to turn left set out in those two sections are not identical, their duty to avoid a collision with the approaching vehicle before turning left in the intersection is nevertheless similar."

I thought the chick in red (redish?) just came out guns-ablazing, but then I rewatched it and she was just trying to pull the guy off her male buddy there, and only became physical when those chicken shits DOUBLE TEAMED him.  Both the guys in the white car have serious aggression issues.  I just want to add that I was impressed by how many people stopped to help. It's not the best idea to get between people fighting, but I felt that they had strength in numbers and did a pretty good job.  EDIT: Classic reactionary redditor. I assumed it was a road rage thing and that the white car took it too far. According to this comment they know each other, so we really don't know what personal stuff went on between the two parties prior to the fight. Still, two on one is pretty chicken shit.

I don't think people realize or give a shit that using the on/off ramp to jump to the front of the line only to force their way back into traffic like this only makes the congestion worse. That being said brake checking was a dumb idea and the van driver is an idiot."

They don't care that it makes traffic worse (if they even do realize it) - they just care that they are half a dozen cars ahead.  They aren't capable or willing to think far enough ahead to realize that if no-one did it, things would be moving faster.  I will actively block someone that I see jump out of the lane will the obviously sole purpose of skipping to the front. The instant that I see them pull out, I'll pull out (when I'm six or so cars ahead). This way it's in no way brake-checking them or anything, and they can't pull a ""they pulled out right in front of me!""  I won't do it if I don't know for sure that the person is skipping the line, though. Only if it is clear that they didn't come off the exit and stay in the closing lane until the end.  Everytime that I've done this, people around me leave me space to get back in. No one has told me to piss off aside from the idiot skipping line, and no one has honked at me. Once or twice, the person skipping line has gone on the shoulder to go around me, but f****d if I'm gonna swerve in front of them to block them like that."

Was the cheapest at the time. Have had it for something like 8 months, quality isn't the best (no reading plates at a distance, but my pitted windshield doesn't help that's for sure) but it does what it needs to.  Not really any excuse to not have a dash cam. You can have a reliable set up for $50 and one hour of your time, all-in. If you can afford a car, you can afford a dashcam. Drive less aggressively for a month if you need to. 6L/100km vs 10L/100km saves money over some time."

TorontoDriving,3azgvy,AQUA2,6,Thu Jun 25 03:49:22 2015 UTC,YD will teach you how to drive properly and then separately how to pass the test. They aren't actually the same since everyone breaks the law here and following it by the T will actually make you a hazard. They mostly taught me although by the time I took it I had a bit of experience driving on a farm. Number 1 thing I learned? Look well ahead.

TorontoDriving,3anugs,incarnatethegreat,2,Mon Jun 22 03:39:50 2015 UTC,"And that the driver stayed stopped. When something like this happens to me while driving (and thankfully nothing as close as this has, they've all been feet away and stopped earlier than this lady) , my priority is to not get rear-ended by a large SUV rushing to beat the light. The instant that they step back out of my way, I'm continuing forwards if I haven't been able to confirm that there is no one behind me (they can quickly sneak up on you on some streets in Scarborough). If they're stupid enough to then run into the side of my car, so be it. I'm rather confident that no one can do anything to me for letting a pedestrian run into my car while I am moving away from them. But if I've managed to avoid hitting them and they step away then I'm going to assume quite reasonably that they won't run back out in front of me.

I have seen moms cross with their baby in the stroller with 2 seconds left on the timer, people casually enter the intersection on a yellow light and become perplexed why left turning vehicles are honking at them, and stuff like this in the video. The most absolute infuriating thing is when pedestrians start crossing the street on an angle and not in the designated crosswalk. You look at the crosswalk and see it's all clear but someone 5 feet away from it starts crossing and makes their way to it from a dangerous position. Then they look mad at you that you had to slam their brakes. Fuck stupid pedestrians."
TorontoDriving,3anugs,ywgflyer,7,Mon Jun 22 05:34:44 2015 UTC,"The people who start crossing with 1 second left, and just shamble across while stopping to smell the flowers along the way are the worst. Thanks, pal, I'm halfway through my left turn..guess I should just sit here and get nailed by the oncoming guy who's flooring it to beat the light.  I've actually seen this lead to an accident once already, in exactly this manner -- pedestrian starts walking on the yellow, left turner hits the brakes hard and gets a T-bone from someone trying to beat the light (who had a half second of braking time and reduced what very well could have been a very serious crash)."
TorontoDriving,3anugs,frankiefaithful829,3,Mon Jun 22 14:41:06 2015 UTC,I'm with you. Pedestrians have to start taking more responsibility for their owns lives. They can't always rely on the driver to make the appropriate evasive maneuvers. I give credit to that driver right there for being 100% on the ball. Very well done. Can't say as much for the pedestrian.

TorontoDriving,39rp77,ladieslovetheflowehh,3,Thu Jun 18 15:17:00 2015 UTC,"That Accord is following way too closely.  But the driver in front is so blatantly unaware of this surroundings (a car right behind him and a changing light) that he slams on the brakes in a knee-jerk reaction because he didn't look at the light in time or plan his entrance to the intersection.  This creates a highly dangerous situation for the person behind you who has sped up to the run the intersection the same as you are doing.    The Accord was following too close, but that driver in front slammed on his brakes at the most highly inappropriate time given his surroundings and he had no way of stopping safely."
TorontoDriving,39j1rg,Blink99s,12,Fri Jun 12 01:45:35 2015 UTC,Before anyone mentions me using my phone while driving. The guy in the 300 didn't want the guy on the bike to merge in front of him and even though the bike was able to merge he tried to push him into oncoming traffic.Even though I didn't catch it on video I thought I should record the incident in case the driver actually hit him with his car.
TorontoDriving,39j1rg,stirry,21,Fri Jun 12 01:49:23 2015 UTC,"While the Chrysler may have been in the wrong, the motorcyclist should have gotten himself out of that situation at the start of the video.

TorontoDriving,39j1rg,ywgflyer,3,Fri Jun 12 18:09:57 2015 UTC,Regardless of what happened in this situation. I disagree with your point of view. I feel we all have an obligation to let merging cars in. Yes there isn't a law stipulating that it has to happen but we shouldn't have to rely on some law to make us treat each with respect. Traffic has to merge one way or another. Why not let that merging car in it's the nice thing to do and keeps traffic flowing in all directions. I am also a biker.
TorontoDriving,39j1rg,KarmaShawarma,3,Fri Jun 12 23:37:16 2015 UTC,"I am surprised biker didn't make 300's wing mirrors fly.. That's like attempted murder.

Forcing their way ahead wherever possible, changing lanes all the time just to try to get one car up in line (and failing) etc etc.  As for your last point... yeah, that's what bothers me. Forcing your way in actually slows everyone down... just take the open spot behind me that myself and the guy behind me created for you and stop trying to butt in front of me on the tail of the guy that I already let in. That's the fast and easy way to go about it. Same way every time, just alternate..."

TorontoDriving,38x5qb,dumdau,-6,Sun Jun 7 22:32:18 2015 UTC,"Why are you turning so tight that your driving on the shoulder? Dude, you have to drive wider on the on ramp so you can pick up speed faster. Although that guy is much much worse. What a moron. I just shake my head at him."
TorontoDriving,38x5qb,frankiefaithful829,3,Wed Jun 10 16:44:28 2015 UTC,"Actually the most efficient way around a bend like that is to move inside.  Not that this is a race track... but if it was he's taking the ""correct"" line.  But as this is a street... to obey the laws he should be within the lines."
TorontoDriving,38x5qb,JacksterTO,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:23:30 2015 UTC,"You're right it's not a race track. If he was trying to get to a finish line, then taking the inside would get you there faster at the same or even slower speed because of less distance traveled, but because it's not a race track and just a short on ramp, the time savings are negligible, and you would only be able to travel 30 - 40km/hr safety at that turning radius. And although you'd make it to the straight away slightly before somebody making a wider turn, you'd be at a lot slower speed and have to pick up a lot more and a lot quicker to merge on the highway safely at 100km/hr. Whereas making a wider turn allows you to travel faster at 40 - 70km/hr, closing the speed increase gap from when you get to the bottom of the on ramp, to safely merging onto the highway at 100km/hr. That will get you on the highway earlier, or allow you more time to merge safely should you choose to at the end of the closing lane. Of course this can be negated if you had a more powerful engine like a race car, which most cars on their commute don't. Should you choose to turn tight at a lot higher and reckless speed, you increase the risk of losing control of the vehicle, and of course a collision in situations such as these, or a collision with a stalled vehicle on the shoulder when you can't see around the bend. But also bare in mind the posted speed limit for on ramps are just a suggested speed. Many times if it's posted 30km/hr, you may be able to travel a lot quicker, even at more than double the speed depending on your vehicle, how wide you're making the turn, and road, weather and traffic conditions. The wider you turn (within the lines), the faster you can go safely, the safer you can merge."

Positioning  Lane splitting  In heavy traffic, some motorcycle and moped drivers try “lane splitting” by driving on the line between lanes of traffic. This is extremely dangerous. Do not do it. It puts you too close to other vehicles. Other drivers do not expect a vehicle to be in that space. Just a small movement, such as a vehicle starting to change lanes or a door opening, can cause a collision because there is no place else for you to go.

Please don't read further into this than is there. I just think that close calls force people to accept reality. That is why I will wait as long as safely possible until reacting to someone's idiotic manoeuvre, so that they notice/realize what a terrible thing it was that they did (i.e. they change into my lane when I'm next to them, and I'll just sit there and not move - I don't care about some scratches and shallow dents on my car, and if traffic is sparse then there is no risk to us spinning out of control and bursting into flames).

No.   I you merge one lane at a time, if you need to merge two, you merge into the first, turn off your signal, check your mirrors and blind spot, signal, and merge.  You can't just merge two lanes at a time in busy traffic and especially not with suck a long vehicle."

TorontoDriving,36zp5y,YHMTrash,10,Thu May 28 15:26:04 2015 UTC,Not even CLOSE to being the cammers fault. The bus changed lanes putting the cammer parallel to the bus. If anything the cammer attempted to speed up to get out of the blind spot of the bus which is the reasonable thing to do in this situation (especially considering we don't know what traffic is like behind the car).   There is no situation that the vehicle making the lane change is not at fault for the resulting accident.
TorontoDriving,36zp5y,Theonetheycalljane,1 point,Sat May 23 23:41:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not of the mind that the cammer is at fault, just that he could've been more defensive."

Putting a turn signal DOES NOT give you the right of way. You put your signal on, you look first, and if it's clear you move. In this case the bus put his signal on and changed lanes in one action without looking. It is his fault, plain and simple."

TorontoDriving,36zp5y,tomedic99,5,Sun May 31 15:14:24 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid you're wrong again. A bus with its turn signal on only has the right of way when emerging from a ""bus bay"" or ""bus stop"". As this bus is on the highway this certainly does not apply (section 142.1). Furthermore, it also specifies that a bus may not change lanes if there is a vehicle is too close it is impractical for it to slow down or stop. So even if it was a bus stop or bus bay the bus would not have the right of way. Wrong again.   Lastly, the car tried to get out of the way by accelerating passed the bus. He tried to get out of the blind spot that the bus put him in. However the bus moved without looking and could easily have killed multiple people.   The car driver behaved just fine."
TorontoDriving,36zp5y,Theonetheycalljane,-11,Mon Jun 1 01:24:37 2015 UTC,If anything the cammer sped up to deny the bus a lane change. Very common practise in the GTA
TorontoDriving,36zp5y,YHMTrash,12,Mon Jun 1 17:58:34 2015 UTC,"lol, my god you must be blind. He was already parallel to the bus when the bus made the first lane change. The BUS put the CAR in his blind spot.   How did you get a license?"
TorontoDriving,36zp5y,Theonetheycalljane,2,Sun May 24 13:29:17 2015 UTC,"Good. I might do the same thing in the driver's position. Better to force my right of way and make myself visible to the driver by being right beside them (their seat, not their vehicle) than at the back of the bus.  If someone is trying to make a lane change into my vehicle, I will not let them do it. They can wait four seconds for me to pass, and use those seconds to think about how they could have signaled earlier when there was no-one there. Not their right of way, and it's dangerous behaviour. Don't tolerate it, if you can do so safely."
TorontoDriving,36zp5y,Dose_of_Reality,11,Sun May 24 16:21:53 2015 UTC,"How was the cam driver in the wrong?  The bus came across two lanes.  You should never change over two lanes that fast in a vehicle of that large size.    Watch, the bus makes a successful lane change to come beside the cam, and then with barely a hesitation or blind spot check, starts to move over again, cutting off the cam driver.  The bus is completely in the wrong."

Also the time that I was turning left off an 80km/h provincial highway (Highway 15), and had an empty transport coming up on me from behind at night. I sped up to give a ~500m+ gap so that I could slow down to make my turn and not inconvenience the transport (had my signal on for ten seconds before the turn, while I was speeding up). A car without lights on came up over the hill that was right after my turn, forcing me to wait a couple seconds to make my turn. Within that time, the transport had not slowed down at all, and passed on my right at 80km/h with the left wheels only a couple feet on the pavement. That was scary.

It's why so many people want to do u-turns.  At certain times of the day, there's so much traffic coming out of the portlands area, the traffic just gets too clogged when left-turns from Esso are allowed.

This is great if you're eastbound, not so much if you want to go westbound on Lakeshore.

TorontoDriving,32toei,jontss,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:08:06 2015 UTC,"Guy recording probably thought the van was just lane changing, in which case the recorder still has right of way and van needs to wait for the way to be clear to finish his lane change.  Or the recorder didn't notice the turn signal since it's the same lamp as the brake lights which the van driver flashed a whole bunch of times right before he turned the signal on.  That is one reason I dislike the tail lights on most North American cars.  They combine too many signals into one light."

The driver making the turn can't see if an incoming car is signalling it'll go to the right lane, if it's behind another car.  3) More importantly, the driver behind can't see what the driver making the turn can, and no one has to do a right turn on a red. If you would have honked at this, you're also an asshole.  Edit: the amount of assholes in this thread is unbelievable. Apparently honking your horn like a maniac and speeding enough to make your tires screech is all good because the driver in front took additional 20 seconds to be extra safe.

I've never been honked it in the last three years I've been driving for turning beside another vehicle...   The road the driver was turning into gets its second lane less than 150m before the intersection   A safe turn can still be made. Watch the video, there were sizeable gaps where there was not a car in the lane. Once I'll give them, but there were three or four times they could have gone after that. It's not a hard thing to do.

OP must be doing something odd, like straightening out late or turning their wheels late rather than doing a smooth turn.   A safe turn can still be made. Watch the video, there were sizeable gaps where there was not a car in the lane. Once I'll give them, but there were three or four times they could have gone after that. It's not a hard thing to do.   I agree that there were sizable gaps, but I've had too many cars change lanes without signalling just before the intersection or even in the intersection when I've committed to turning right because it is safe. I can't say what I would do in the cammer's situation because we can't see left, but it's possible that I may not go. And if you honk at me for it, have fun. I'll just honk back haha.

Since there's nothing wrong with my turns, the only thing I could determine is that people who honk wanted to use the lane I just turned into, that's why it's been a while I stopped assuming people will stay in their lanes."
TorontoDriving,32vp74,AOL_,-2,Fri Apr 17 15:52:39 2015 UTC,"A safe turn can still be made.    I disagree. Again, if car A is coming at ~80Km/h with the intention of going to the right lane, and all of a sudden car B that's coming from a full stop gets in front of him because the driver couldn't see the signal (since car A was behind car C, both travelling in the same direction), car A will have very little time to react."

If the light is red and the driver in front of you does not feel it's safe to make the turn, even though you think it is, it's his/her right to turn whenever he/she feels it's OK to do so.   Your assessment of the situation for another driver simply does not matter because, believe it or not, you're not the other driver. Yes, you can honk your heart's content, because it's your horn, but it's up to the other driver to decide if/when it's safe to make a right turn on a red."

TorontoDriving,31bnz5,Comms,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:55:15 2015 UTC,"He replied to a few of the Youtube comments claiming the dash cam had better line of site than he did. Hard to confirm or deny that I suppose, but I still feel it could have been avoided."
TorontoDriving,31bnz5,karlos349,5,Sat Apr 4 03:53:13 2015 UTC,"A cam has a better vantage point than a driver and the benefit of wide angle, no blindspots due to A-pillars, and unblinking attention.  Cam View  Wide angle also distorts distance and makes it appear as if the car is a) further away and b) moving more slowly than it is actually going"
TorontoDriving,31bnz5,Comms,3,Mon Apr 6 16:08:22 2015 UTC,"I agree that it could have possibly been avoided.  The car was pulled in front of that truck about 2-3 car lengths. Let's give the cammer the benefit of the doubt that he couldn't see anything until the front of his vehicle was lined up with the trucks front end. That's still almost 2 seconds until he hits the brakes, and there's also an open lane to the right for another possible way out. I can't believe there was no horn or a swerve at the slightest.  I feel that I'm a pretty defensive driver. Passing at 80km/h in the right lane with stopped traffic is pretty fucking risky. I would have at least had a hand covering the horn and my foot over the brake pedal going through there.  Maybe I'm just a backseat driver, but fuck.. this is the kind of shit they warn you about in driving school."
TorontoDriving,31bnz5,oFLIPSTARo,1 point,Sat Apr 4 04:20:16 2015 UTC,"Not disagreeing on the amount of time it took the driver to react, but I'd be careful with swerving unless you know exactly what's going on in the lane beside you. Cars can sneak up into your blind spot and suddenly you've missed one accident only to cause another."
TorontoDriving,31bnz5,Groundloop,1 point,Sat Apr 4 15:45:00 2015 UTC,"No doubt that it's something you have to be aware of.  In this instance though, if you've been checking your mirrors and being aware, you'd know what's happening in the lane over to the right. You'd be passing a stopped tractor trailer, and a black vehicle still a ways out from making a turn out of the gas station. The chance of someone sneaking up behind you is very slim.  If you're a defensive driver you always try to have an exit strategy. I believe defensive drivers put in this situation would have known they were putting themselves in a high risk situation and that the right lane was a viable exit.  Sure, I'm probably talking out my ass because I wasn't there, but we can all agree this whole incident could have been avoidable one way or another. This is why we don't call them accidents but collisions. :)"

TorontoDriving,2ztvgo,gagnonje5000,5,Sat Mar 21 18:52:26 2015 UTC,Normally I'm a stickler for following the rules in Toronto and get upset that no one does but how is going around a pulled over vehicle (bus) illegal? I will admit it can be dangerous but I figured since the bus is technically pulled over (often with 4 way flashers on) it would be perfectly legal to go around it.
TorontoDriving,2ztvgo,jontss,5,Sun Mar 22 00:12:38 2015 UTC,"It also looks like the bus wasn't at the line, in which case I'd wonder if that was illegal. I guess they weren't in the correct lane at time of turn and I did notice the suv turned on a red without stopping, perhaps a rolling stop at a red?"
TorontoDriving,2ztvgo,Longthicknhard,6,Sun Mar 22 01:02:34 2015 UTC,That could be it.
TorontoDriving,2ztvgo,jontss,4,Sun Mar 22 02:13:43 2015 UTC,I really hope that's it because this doesn't look at all unreasonable.
TorontoDriving,2ztvgo,ieGod,4,Tue Mar 31 13:54:12 2015 UTC,"From what I see in the video, the bus had its right turn signal on. So cutting in front and turning right at the corner was an illegal move.   However, if the bus had their 4-ways on then it's OK."
TorontoDriving,2ztvgo,freshmesh32,8,Sun Mar 22 01:00:05 2015 UTC,Even that is iffy because they use the same signal to indicate they are pulling over a lot of the time. It's rare for them to use the 4 ways when they stop. I happen to think they should use 4 ways for stopping and signal for turning just so we can differentiate easier.
TorontoDriving,2ztvgo,jontss,2,Sun Mar 22 02:13:33 2015 UTC,"I can't tell the difference between a bus that is stopped normally and a bus that broken down. The drivers don't all do the same thing. Sometimes they use 4ways as they slow down and nothing while they're stopped, sometimes they're broken down without 4ways on (sat behind a bus through an entire green light because of this once, not happening again), sometimes they leave the right turn on the whole time..."
TorontoDriving,2ztvgo,jim_from_canada,2,Thu Apr 2 18:06:52 2015 UTC,Does the bus route actually turn right at that point?    I guess the SUV driver could just argue he was passing a disabled vehicle.
TorontoDriving,2ztvgo,arcum,2,Sun Mar 22 01:35:35 2015 UTC,"Does the bus route actually turn right at that point?     No, it goes straight. However this stop is quite busy, so it can take a while to load/unload."
TorontoDriving,2ztvgo,Funkehed,1 point,Sun Mar 22 03:04:48 2015 UTC,"You can go around a bus, but you cannot make a right turn from the center lane.  That's clearly illegal and extremely dangerous.  The bus can pull away from the curb at any time and you just went directly across the path of a moving bus.  You make a right turn from a marked right turn lane, or the rightmost lane.    I SUPPOSE you could go around the bus, pull into the lane in front, signal, stop, and then go."
TorontoDriving,2ztvgo,jontss,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:08:57 2015 UTC,"You should be able to make a right from a more left lane if there is a vehicle pulled over and stopped, blocking you from using the proper lane, IMO.  I am probably in the wrong, legally, however.  There should be some discretion in this case.  The bus driver should signal that he is pulling over (right turn signal), stopped/stopping (4 ways), and then signal left to indicate he is merging into live traffic again, move towards the center lane before/as he is going through the intersection.  IMO since the bus is the one pulling over it should be his responsibility to ensure he does not pull forward or to the left until it is safe to do so just as if any other vehicle were to pull over for and stop to let passengers on and off. Although he does have right of way if he signals his intention properly since he is a transit vehicle.  Why should everyone else on the road wait behind the bus?  Who knows how long that bus is going to be stopped there or if the driver is just going to leave the bus there to go find a Tim Hortons?  I see that from time to time (used to be almost daily but I don't really pass a Tim's anymore).  Also, in a slightly related note, I see people make rights from the left and lefts from the right all the time even when there are no vehicles blocking the proper lane.  I feel that this situation is much more dangerous and troublesome than passing a pulled over bus slightly improperly.  Never seen someone pulled over for it."
TorontoDriving,2ztvgo,mattehohoh,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:32:48 2015 UTC,"I am probably in the wrong, legally, however.    You are wrong, you are advocating unsafe behaviour, and yes, you are advocating an illegal maneuver.  I stopped reading there."
TorontoDriving,2ztvgo,oprimo,0,Thu Apr 9 12:27:04 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between an ""immovable object"" and a ""waiting to move object.""  If there was a disabled vehicle, of course I would go around it, safely.  If there's a vehicle delayed and I'm behind it, I would wait a reasonable amount of time for the vehicle to move and then go around if it didn't.  I would not cut across several lanes of traffic or perform an illegal right turn to go around it because I can't wait 30sec-1min which is usually how long it takes a bus to move off from a stop.  Spinning your tires is very dangerous because that's how you lose control of your vehicle, which is incredibly dangerous because it's a 3000-5000 lb metal object moving quickly, out of control.  Are you new to driving?  Why would I drive like I'm in New York if I live in Toronto?  Way to create a false-equivalence.  I have driven in New York and have no problem moving through that city.  I've also driven buses, motorcycles, and trucks in Toronto with no accidents and no complaints from clients/customers.  My current license is a CMZ.  I'm also a licensed pilot and boat operator.  What would you like to know about operating vehicles safely?"
TorontoDriving,2ztvgo,scr0dumb,0,Thu Apr 9 13:00:18 2015 UTC,"I have those qualifications because I've dedicated myself to professionally learning more about vehicles throughout my life.  I am relatively ""better"" than a lot of drivers on the road who only have a G license and have no experience with transporting people or operating large and complex vehicles.  That's simply a fact, much like how an airline pilot is probably a ""better"" pilot than a cessna pilot simply due to experience with their mode of transportation.    As for vehicle safety, it is not just the ""bus"" in this scenario.  It's the 1-50 people on board who could be injured by a collision if the bus stops suddenly.  I think everyone thinks, it's just a ""bus"" when they pull these types of maneuvers and ignore the danger inside the vehicle.  In that sense, the right turn from a center introduces an unnecessary element of risk to the occupants of the bus, and is not only an illegal move, but an unsafe and unsupportable maneuver."

TorontoDriving,2zs815,hokum_,5,Sun Mar 22 19:15:28 2015 UTC,Ugh that tow truck driver. I've watched countless ones speed down city streets and pass everyone by going into an empty left turn lane and speed through red lights.

TorontoDriving,2zrv2f,texanwacko,15,Sat Mar 21 03:27:10 2015 UTC,This is at Ryerson University downtown and is a heavily crossed intersection by students trying to get to the Engineering building across the street. Often people wont look before crossing because they are idiots and the sheer number of people means that one or two almost get hit...
TorontoDriving,2zrv2f,souurdiesel,4,Sat Mar 21 04:47:23 2015 UTC,"There's a crossing between two U of T engineering buildings which is pretty dangerous too. It's on St George, north of college. So many idiots jaywalk poorly there and I've seen some bike on pedestrian collisions and some close calls between pedestrians and bikes."
TorontoDriving,2zrv2f,killallthebugs,11,Mon Mar 23 19:03:45 2015 UTC,"Two other cars were stopped and neither of them were turning, which should have given the biker a huge hint to watch out for an issue at that intersection.  Situational Awareness.  Listen to what the rest of the traffic is trying to tell you.   Always assume that a stopped car blocking your vision is blocking that dumb pedestrian, car, whatever that is about to jump out in front of you.  Stopped cars also often suddenly get squirrelly and jump into your lane without looking when the driver gets fed up with whatever is blocking them and suddenly decides to change lans and isn't thinking about anything other than what is frustrating them.  I also always let off the gas going through intersections like that, too many avenues for someone to take a dumb move into your path.  Idiots running reds, cars taking blind left turns into your path, suicidal peds coming from either direction on either crosswalk.  And you can either blindly go by your legal Right of Way and get yourself into accidents, or you can drive defensively and avoid all of the problems involved in getting into an accident (damage to you, your vehicle, the other person, dealing with insurance companies and the police, etc)."
TorontoDriving,2zrv2f,scubadger,2,Sun Mar 22 18:56:24 2015 UTC,"Two other cars were stopped and neither of them were turning   Situational awareness is always good, but you can't predict or anticipate other drivers at all times. How many people turn without even signaling at all?"
TorontoDriving,2zrv2f,ieGod,1 point,Tue Mar 31 14:21:47 2015 UTC,I'd say about 75% or higher.
TorontoDriving,2zrv2f,jontss,4,Thu Apr 9 11:16:44 2015 UTC,"Good find. 70 in a 50 zone is normal for Toronto drivers. Pedestrians should watch out - even if you think you've timed the crossing right, or are using a proper crosswalk, someone in a car or motorcycle might come screaming along at 20 or 30 kmh over the limit and just won't be able to stop in time. Always wait until traffic comes to a complete stop before proceeding."

TorontoDriving,2zrv2f,Xianruflux,-4,Thu Apr 9 11:17:36 2015 UTC,"Can I ask why you do that? I really don't understand. The speed limits are assigned to roads based upon very specific formula which take into account many factors that the average driver does not usually account for in their driving. Do you succumb to peer pressure? Do you feel so rushed in your daily life that every second you can shave off your drive matters more than other people's safety, convenience or schedule? Do you hate yourself and others? I am not taking a shot at you I am genuinely curious as I do not understand the motivation for this kind of behaviour."
TorontoDriving,2zrv2f,arcum,11,Sat Mar 21 19:46:28 2015 UTC,"It's usually safer to ""go with the flow"" and be aware of your surroundings.  Going 80 in a 60 is doable in outer suburbs, due to wider roads.  But there's no chance of that downtown as traffic is heavier and there are a lot more cyclists/pedestrians to watch out for."
TorontoDriving,2zrv2f,AOL_,6,Sun Mar 22 01:43:47 2015 UTC,"Like I said in my post, if traffic is flowing at 80, I go 80. I drive with traffic and not against it. It's not about saving time, or peer pressure or any of that. Do you go 100 on the 401 in the very left lane?"
TorontoDriving,2zrv2f,Xianruflux,7,Sat Mar 21 19:52:32 2015 UTC,When I'm on the 401 I do anywhere from 112-115 depending on conditions and my mood. I consider the mechanical advancements in newer vehicles to have outpaced the speed limits on the 400 series highways and I take into consideration that those speeds were reduced during the oil crisis in the late 1970s as a fuel conservation measure and not for safety reasons. If you find me in a lane other than the right hand lane it is either to allow someone to enter the highway more easily or to pass someone slower than myself. In either case I try not to inconvenience other drivers while doing so.
TorontoDriving,2zrv2f,AOL_,11,Sat Mar 21 20:04:37 2015 UTC,"That's good, I really hate the left lane bandits. I usually go 110-125 on the highway, but I go 0-100 real quick."

TorontoDriving,2zrkgb,BDoYR,1 point,Sat Mar 21 02:08:55 2015 UTC,"That's my biggest pet peeve: Drivers rushing through after the light turns red. Just because you are in a car doesn't mean you get to break the rules. Pedestrian waited his turn, why couldn't the drivers?"
TorontoDriving,2zrkgb,TorontoBob22,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:19:38 2015 UTC,The pedestrian should checked the intersection and proceeded when it was safe. End of story.
TorontoDriving,2zrkgb,frankiefaithful829,-4,Mon Apr 6 13:33:41 2015 UTC,"One of my biggest pet peeves here. When pedestrians start crossing the instant the light goes green, without waiting for the advance left turn drivers to clear the intersection. As someone who walks a lot in Mississauga it's not hard to tell when cars are turning left. I realize a lot of drivers cut it close, but it's no excuse to jam up the intersection.  Edit: To clarify, this is a pet peeve as a fellow pedestrian. It's equivalent to walking out in front of a red light runner; yes the driver is in the wrong, but doesn't mean you should jump in front of them. I see way too many close calls every day and read about way too many pedestrians getting hit. The driver may be at fault in a lot of scenarios, but I promise you the car almost always wins. To be clear, I'm not an over entitled driver getting mad at pedestrians legally crossing and getting in my way (I don't even drive). I'm just dumbfounded by other pedestrians lack of situational awareness."
TorontoDriving,2zrkgb,karlos349,10,Sat Mar 21 01:47:20 2015 UTC,"The pedestrian light doesn't turn on until the advance left signal dissappears. The truck driver did a left turn without an advance green, you can see how the other side stopped well before him. He was fully in the wrong here, and maybe even the lady in front of him who shouldn't have committed to the left turn on a late-yellow."
TorontoDriving,2zrkgb,texanwacko,3,Sat Mar 21 03:05:35 2015 UTC,"If the light was that way, then yes, it stands that they should be at fault.  However, all of this could have been prevented if the pedestrian had waited an extra 5 seconds for them to clear the bloody intersection.  Its incredibly selfish to just cross like that and leave drivers sitting in the intersection inable to clear."
TorontoDriving,2zrkgb,Dose_of_Reality,12,Sat Mar 21 03:40:48 2015 UTC,All of this could have been prevented if the drivers didn't run the advance light.
TorontoDriving,2zrkgb,texanwacko,3,Sat Mar 21 03:52:39 2015 UTC,"I agree, but once those fuckers make an obvious and irreversible mistake, the safest thing to do is let them clear the intersection.  What if the truck was going faster and when it hits the sedan the sedan plows forward into the pedestrian.  Why put your own body in harms way (harm that is obvious and immediate, the cars are clearly in the intersection and need a place to go).  Once the pedestrian starts crossing it creates an expontentially more dangerous situation which could have been easily, simply prevented with 5 seconds of patience."
TorontoDriving,2zrkgb,Dose_of_Reality,6,Sat Mar 21 03:58:19 2015 UTC,Pedestrians don't think like that. Especially ones who don't drive. To them a walk signal means it is safe to cross.   Councillors are always talking about lowering the speed limits and this and that but if they just educated pedestrians the pedestrians would be even safer.  Ever see people glued to their phones while crossing an intersection? To me that should be ticketable just like texting and driving.
TorontoDriving,2zrkgb,scr0dumb,3,Sat Mar 21 05:11:51 2015 UTC,Pedestrians don't think like that.   Are you telling me pedestrians are incapable of looking both ways before crossing the street? Do you consider people to be nothing more than lemmings?
TorontoDriving,2zrkgb,Dose_of_Reality,3,Sat Mar 21 21:45:56 2015 UTC,Yesterday on a short 30min drive through downtown Toronto I had 3 pedestrians step out in front of my car without looking in my direction. I understand the neighbourhood may have been sketchy and they may have been on drugs... but come on.   Who steps onto a street without looking left? Apparently... many people.

This guy on the other side, on his phone, starts crossing at 4, and keeps going, as casual as you like.  This isn't a small road.  The advance green starts and now cars are headed straight for him, he appears blind to them.  I point rather emphatically at the line of cars driving right at him.  He shrugs, tells me 'I started first, and I ain't running.'  I respond 'well, you should.'  Pedestrians like him aren't helping.  And he was wearing a shirt that said politzia..."

TorontoDriving,2zrkgb,RAND0M-HER0,3,Sat Mar 21 06:26:05 2015 UTC,"Your estate gonna pay to clean your carcass off the street?  Some councilors want to reduce the speed limit to make pedestrians safe.

TorontoDriving,2zeni3,Pwnzetta,8,Thu Mar 19 12:54:38 2015 UTC,.... a Hit and run?
TorontoDriving,2zeni3,AsaadCreativeINC,-4,Thu Mar 19 14:26:18 2015 UTC,"But you wouldn't be ""hitting"" anyone. You can't get charged for assault if you brush shoulders with someone while walking through a crowd."
TorontoDriving,2zeni3,Pwnzetta,4,Thu Mar 19 15:32:21 2015 UTC,"i am no expert, but i got a feeling driving in a car regardless of speed and hitting someone counts as a hit and run/attempted murder.  Unless there is a minimum speed requirement i am not aware of...  But, i get your frustration ... watching the kids go at it was pretty funny"
TorontoDriving,2zeni3,AsaadCreativeINC,3,Thu Mar 19 15:37:15 2015 UTC,ppl get charged. cops are very understanding of unions as they are in a strong one themselves.
TorontoDriving,2zeni3,quazy,1 point,Thu Mar 19 23:56:57 2015 UTC,Assault with a deadly weapon.
TorontoDriving,2zeni3,hearwa,0,Sat Apr 25 01:30:38 2015 UTC,"That's vehicular assault under the criminal code, and if you take flight; you'll be arrested in short-order and appear in court.   Rest assured, you will be character assassinated by the media even before your trial. Good luck getting a job, when google searches for your name returns: hit & run at YorkU picket line."
TorontoDriving,2zeni3,manoeuvre44,-3,Fri Mar 20 21:05:00 2015 UTC,"Why picketers are delaying cars was answered best by /u/DrZellers/ https://www.reddit.com/r/yorku/comments/2yplnj/why_picketers_are_delaying_cars/  If you've already allegedly waited an hour to get to the front of line, why become confrontational? you only have to wait an additional few minutes. This picket-line is not going anywhere until the strike ends. You'll be seeing the same people tomorrow and the day after that.   There's a lot of politics behind the strike where a lot of the fault is from the YorkU administration and not CUPE.   Just because the union delayed you a few minutes shouldn't mean they don't get your support; if you're getting delayed then educate yourself about what's happening between CUPE3903 and YorkU.  There's a lot of misinformation being spread here; before you go around threatening to attack or kill picketers you should educate yourself as to what is going on."
TorontoDriving,2ze2wg,AOL_,8,Tue Mar 17 20:32:19 2015 UTC,I love how Torontonians commit 100% to their mistakes.
TorontoDriving,2ze2wg,Ralphyboy23,11,Wed Mar 18 02:00:37 2015 UTC,"Just like Toronto drivers,  get on freeway and to the left lane immediately for no good reason.  Both of you."
TorontoDriving,2ze2wg,rokob,6,Wed Mar 18 01:28:06 2015 UTC,no good reason   Express on-ramp?
TorontoDriving,2ze2wg,evboyce,5,Thu Mar 19 12:49:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no reason either of these drivers had to go that far left. Arg!!"
TorontoDriving,2ze2wg,march1studios,4,Thu Mar 19 12:20:24 2015 UTC,"There were two transports and a rock truck in the middle lanes. That's more than enough reason to go straight to the passing lane.  I don't like the close lane changes behind another car, but there's not much to complain about for OP's driving imo, given that they signaled clearly and had room behind them."
