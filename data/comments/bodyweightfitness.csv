bodyweightfitness,3e3fpw,vtcramennoodle,3,Tue Jul 21 17:38:06 2015 UTC,"You can get really complex and overbuilt, like the example in the Fitness FAQ video another user posted, or you can get pretty minimalist.   Your plan sounds like a good one and is very close to what I did.   I bought two 4x4x10 posts, and had a 3/4"" x 60"" black pipe from something else already. Drilled holes, screwed a ""floor"" flange onto either side of the pipe, screwed the flange to the outside of the posts. I put the posts 24"" into the dirt, putting the bar at about 8 feet. I'm 6', so with arms extended I have to jump a few inches to grab the bar. Doing it again I would probably put it six inches deeper just so I could grab it standing on my tip-toes.   Two feet is deep enough. One foot is probably deep enough, and you could probably go with 8' posts if you wanted too. Hell, you could probably even use 2x4s -- I believe they're strong enough. Depends on your need. Backfilling it with the dirt you dug is probably enough, but a 60# bag of concrete mix is only a couple bucks and will make things sturdier.   With the posts, pipe, and hardware, you're probably looking at around $50 in initial investment, but I believe it quickly pays for itself. That's just for a single pull up bar.  I don't think a schematic is necessary -- it's pretty simple and straightforward. Making sure everything is measured right and level will make things a little nicer -- but I pretty much just eyeballed everything and it turned out fine.  I think parallel bars are a good idea. I wanted to build those too, but as soon as I got rings I changed my mind. They wouldn't hurt and I might build some eventually, but the rings fill the need and in some ways might even be better.  I don't personally see the need for bars of different heights, but that's up to you. I hang rings from mine, and about the only thing I wish they were higher for is pull ups. I have to have the straps pretty short which takes most of the instability away which is one of the main benefits/challenges of rings. If I were going to have a separate place to hang the rings, I'd go with much higher, like 12 or higher.  Here's my bar with rings hanging.  After a paint job. I'm not totally sure the wood was treated, so I painted it with some leftover exterior paint we had around. Spray-painted the bar white mostly because the sun can make black metal pretty hot. The white actually does seem to keep it a little cooler.  I also figured out a way to hang my rings in my garage, which have either a 10 or 12 foot ceiling. That way I can use them when it's rainy. I can provide more info on that if interested."
bodyweightfitness,3e3fpw,elzeardclym,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:17:27 2015 UTC,"I think this is what I'm gonna end up doing. Probably a pull up, a second bar higher up just for rings and a set of parallel bars. How far apart do you guys normally suggest for parallel bars?"
bodyweightfitness,3e3fpw,Wayfaring_Chrononaut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:48:38 2015 UTC,Here is the Fitness FAQ guide to building a pull up bar. I would recommend constructing a solid one of these first before adding on parallel bars etc. You really don't want it falling apart on you in training.

Definitely the right decision. Traps are a bit tight on both sides, but knees are doing good. I'm a bit worried I might've overdone my hinge work yesterday but hopefully that'll be alright. Handstand-wise my balance is mainly limited to endurance. Currently the most important drill is forearm-supported handstands, and I tend to stay up there 20s most of the time, at which point I'm fatigued and start falling apart. My kickups and tuck-ups still suck, but are improving every session, so that's nice. I really need to learn to keep both my legs straight on the kickups. Unfortunately I really really really really really suck at one-arm elbow lever. First session I couldn't stay into one at all, so did some double-arm elbow lever second session and tried again today. I can stay up there for a bit, but it's tough. And this is with the other arm still on the floor too! I suspect this is something I'll get the hang of quick enough.  Also, who the fuck thought sets of 10-12 front squats was a good idea? Protip: it's not. Even 40% 1RM kills me. I also need some better footwear. Going to order some wu shoes.  Diet/mood/energy In terms of weight, a 7-day running average has me at ~83ish, but it's a bit all over the place, especially considering the weekend was mostly maintenance/slightly over. This morning I was 81.5. I'm assuming most of that is water weight since I also got a slight headache. Other than a bit of hunger I'm doing well, no real energy loss during workouts. Progress on remaining assignments is slow but steady. Got an 8 for Intuitionistic Mathematics. If I had practiced the proofs more rather than just memorizing the ideas, I could've gotten a higher grade, which is a bit of a bummer, but an 8 is fine."

Goal:  to max out the startbodyweight.com basic progressions at 3x12 by the end of the year (the timeline may have to be revisited, since I seem to be progressing a bit faster than I'd anticipated in the beginning).  Routine:  almost the vanilla startbodyweight.com progression, with a few modifications.  Beginner shrimp squats:  3x12 (been occasionally switching to 3x6 of pistols, but I really don't enjoy doing them for some reason, still trying to figure out how to progress here).  Pullups:  five sets of 4 or 5 (currently at 5,5,4,4,4 I think), supersetting with very light hammer curls (4kg/9lbs) with explosive movement (I'm paying very close attention to the form, otherwise this would probably be dangerous).  This kills the arms.  Wall HSPU (about ten inches from the wall):  don't remember the exact numbers here, just switched to them on Friday.  Something like 10,8,8.  Hanging bent leg raises:  3x12 the last time, will switch to hanging straight leg raises in the next workout.  Diamond pushups:  in the last workout I did 15 in the first set of what was supposed to be my first instance of 3x12, so will definitely have to switch to decline diamond pushups in the next workout.  I'm supersetting these with 8kg tricep extensions, similar to the pullups routine.  This, too, kills the arms.  Elbow wall plank (completely horizontal):  30-50s, my numbers seem to be completely random from workout to workout.  One leg supported L-sits:  almost at 3x60s, but have been slacking on these, need to do them more.  Dips and rows:  I still don't have a way to do either one of them in a way that isn't either dangerous or incredibly annoying.  Will get a power tower some time soon.  Progress:  pretty steady, I usually add one rep to everything every workout.  The exception has been pullups, but I'm not counting the curl reps (I do 15 of the first set, the rest to failure).  The 15 reps of diamond pushups (plus the tricep extensions) kind of blew my mind, since when I first started six or so weeks ago, I could barely do four.  Friday was in general a weird workout -- I came home at 1am fairly drunk, decided I didn't want to skip my workout, and proceeded to knock out several PRs (switched to HSPU from bench pikes, did the 15 diamonds thing, and the 3x12 hanging bent leg raises for the first time).  Diet/mood/energy:  diet is not fantastic, been slacking on that, actually lost a couple of pounds.  Mood is good, energy is great.  Questions:  a few days ago I experimented with doing pushups off a wobble board (Edit:  as in, the hands are on the board).  I didn't try to max out since they're kind of annoying to do (I'm basically shaking like a chihuahua throughout the whole movement), but was wondering if anyone has any experience with those, and whether I should incorporate them as a way of mixing things up a bit."

Personally, I only use hammer for warming up and I don't feel I get far less contraction with them. Once again personally, I really like drag curls for biceps.

Someone suggested keeping legs forward during pull ups to maintain posterior pelvic tilt and achieve a hollow body.  My back hurts when I do that tho.  I feel like it's because my core isn't strong enough. Could that be why? Or is it just bad form... it just feels so unnatural and uncomfortable, so I don't do it.  I know you're not supposed to ask for Medical advice because there's not sufficient info or qualification to assess what the possible problem is.  But if you've experienced the same pain and you figured out what was wrong, hopefully you can share.  Sorry for jumbled answers, I'm on my phone right now, hopefully when I get back home I can clean it up."

bodyweightfitness,3e29cz,Chocrates,10,Tue Jul 21 12:02:41 2015 UTC,"I just suffered through a deload a few weeks back, but it was time to do it. My body was like no mas, but my mind was still like go go. It was like a week of meditation for me.  Not that we can't learn from different sources, but Sommers steady state training talks about how when you learn a new skill, say tuck l-sit, you do it for 12 weeks. the first 4 weeks are overload, you are tired/doms. the next 4 weeks are mastery, it is getting easier, the last 4 weeks are the actual deload, and you should be injury free progressing. However, the focus isn't really on the muscles per se but the tendons and ligaments which grow & regenerate much more slowly than muscles. The reason he focuses so much more there than the muscles is because once you injure yourself, especially a joint the recovery time is enormous.  Here is the quote:   The metabolic rate of connective tissue (tendons and ligaments) is approximately 1/10th that of muscular tissue. This means that connective tissue improves it's strength and flexibility at 1/10th the speed of muscular tissue; and that it also heals TEN times slower. For example, when comparing a slight muscular pull that would require 3 days to heal to a slight connective tissue pull of the same magnitude, the slight connective tissue pull would require 30 days to heal. Yes, that is correct - a full 30 days. This is not to imply that the joint will be dysfunctional for the entire 30 day period, but that it will require that period of time to regain 100% functionality and stability.  There is also a good interview with Robb Wolf and here is the transcript.  http://robbwolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Paleo-Solution-213.pdf Here is the excerpt   Robb Wolf: Interesting and typically the pulling strength being significantly stronger?  Chris Sommers: Being stronger. What tends to happen though is they’re unaware that a metabolic rate of tendons and connective tissue is one tenth out of muscle tissue. So they’ll go and they’ll start climbing the rope and their muscle will be fine but they’ve overloaded their joints. We get this all the time so they say you know, Coach I’m climbing the rope. I know it’s really good for me, I got to master this. My elbows are killing me what should I do? I say well stop climbing the damn rope."

The truth is somewhat more complex, and actually makes much more sense when you hear it and it's sunk in, but you know what? The most important thing is that you find whatever reason  you need to train intelligently to avoid injuries.  If your reasons are wrong, I don't care as long as you are training right.  That might surprise some people, because I do believe that if you understand the real reasons for what is happening you can actually make better decisions regarding your training (as well as not sound like an idiot when you talk to someone who actually understands more of the medical science), but I'd rather have someone doing the right things for the wrong reasons in the gym than doing the wrong thing for the right reasons (if that makes sense... in other words poor application of correct thinking due to incomplete understanding or stubbornness or whatever)."

What I could find did tend to support that tendons/ligaments do get less blood flow and have less of a metabolic rate, so I assumed that the rest of the advice was good. Also, antranik had a page on steady state training so I thought I was in the clear for everything I posted. I am still learning though.  However, I've seen you around this sub and seen your vids (thanks for skin the cat and planche leans) so I will take your advice to heart. But, if you do have any original source materials on either steady state training or various metabolic rate and recoveries of soft tissue I am a nerd and would love to dive into it."
bodyweightfitness,3e29cz,Impudicity2001,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:09:04 2015 UTC,"Well, the general advice of ""don't push super hard for fast gains, let them come slow and steady so you don't get injured"" is correct.  To keep it simple, the tendons themselves don't typically get injured. You typically see muscle tissue strains or strains in the zone where the muscle actually attaches to the tendon, and that's the source of the pain.  I'm not saying you can't injure the tendons themselves, because you can over extended periods of time, but what happens to most people is actually slightly different, and because of that so is the healing time.  Tendons are mostly NOT cellular, while muscles are mostly cellular, and the parts of the tendon that are not injured last 3-5 years before being replaced. They don't have as much of a blood supply because of that, but that doesn't mean that the fibroblasts in tendons are less active than fibroblasts in muscles... that's simply not true, nor is it true that you recover from a muscle injury 10x faster than a tendon injury.  Muscle tissue takes about 6 months after an injury to recover a mature appearance under a microscope, but more severe muscular injuries can take several years to really heal up properly and may never be the same. The same can be true of tendon injuries... the truth is that every injury is somewhat unique, and only by understanding the severity of the injury, the tissues that are affected, and other factors such as acute vs chronic, age of the person, approach to therapy, etc it is possible to say a lot more about what can be done and how long it will take, but you're still just giving a best guess in the end.  The source materials are stress-strain curves of tendons, basic science information on musculoskeletal physiology (basically textbooks)  and rehabilitation methods, and all the research out there that's referenced by these sources.  Unfortunately it is not very easy to correctly interpret research, nor is every textbook equal or particularly accessible, and that makes it very hard for the everyday fitness enthusiast to really separate fact from fiction."
bodyweightfitness,3e29cz,Joshua_Naterman,3,Tue Jul 21 21:54:54 2015 UTC,"inbefore gnuckols.  The thing that gets me thinking, is the concept of muscle debt.  I've thought about it before, but this reinforces it.  The standard theory of strength training is that you trigger some muscle growth, wait for your body to repair and build new muscle, then use your new greater strength to trigger the next muscle growth.  But if muscle growth is dependent almost solely on myonuclei damage, then why can't I go into 'debt' working out consecutive days without rest?  For example, say 1 workout earns me 1 'unit' of muscle growth.  Standard strength theory says to earn 4 'units' of muscle growth, I have to work, rest, work, rest, etc.  Suppose I workout the same muscles 4 days in a row, followed by 4 days of rest.  The question is, do I still receive 4 units of muscle growth?  Do I only receive 1 because standard strength theory is correct?  Do I receive more because of a compounding effect?  Do I receive less than 4 but greater than 1 because muscle debt is real but the body is freaking out about all the damage and releasing estrogen to slow it?"
bodyweightfitness,3e29cz,XtraSparkle,3,Tue Jul 21 13:56:16 2015 UTC,"But if muscle growth is dependent almost solely on myonuclei damage, then why can't I go into 'debt' working out consecutive days without rest?   If you accumulate too much debt, eventually you'll go bankrupt.  Lets stick with the debt analogy, it'll make it easier to explain.  What's one of the best ways to build your credit score? By charging a credit card (accumulating debt) and paying it off in full at end of the month (fully restoring it).  What's one of the best ways to ruin your credit? By charging your card too frequently, and the debt all adds up until eventually, there's no way you can pay it off in time. Then you're in trouble.  It's the same basic thing with muscle building. If you don't allow muscles to fully recover, not only will they not grow, but you're increasing the risk of injury each time you workout without being recovered. Stress is a good thing when it forces good adaptations. Too much stress will delay recovery, slowing the adaptations that you want.  It's cortisol, not so much estrogen, that will be responsible for slowing growth."
bodyweightfitness,3e29cz,S_M2,2,Tue Jul 21 15:07:20 2015 UTC,"The unrelated note that completely took me by surprise (as a guy who does martial arts and gets his hands smashed a lot) is that NSAIDs impair muscle growth.   So, the ACE stack (aspirin, caffeine, ephedrine) used to be fairly popular with bodybuilders as a preworkout back when ephedrine was legal.    If I recall correctly, the broscience behind it was that aspirin is a vasodilator (it's not), and that adding a vasodilator to a stim stack is going to do... something.  So the fact that it actually impairs muscle growth is kind of hilarious."
bodyweightfitness,3e29cz,goltrpoat,4,Tue Jul 21 12:45:11 2015 UTC,"No... The aspirin is to prevent blood clotting, which is a potential side effect of ephedrine.

(I'm sure some misinformed idiot thought it was a vasodilator, but that wasn't the original purpose).  http://examine.com/supplements/ECA/  It's still a common stack used today, and the hypertophy impairment caused by NSAIDS isn't really significant enough to matter to most people."

If you take enough, you'll be able to put more effort into your training, potentially leading to better results. Stims raise your metabolism a little bit, so you'll have to eat more to compensate. How much more depends on what you're taking as well as the dosage. In this case, it would be better to take it shortly before your workout.  Stims are primarily used for cutting, since they raise your metabolism. Doesn't really matter when you take it in this case."

bodyweightfitness,3e29cz,bipocni,3,Tue Jul 21 19:40:29 2015 UTC,"NSAIDs reduce satellite cell recruitment, which is 100% required for repairs to happen.  Different NSAIDs have different strengths and duration of activity, so there's a big difference in taking something like Indomethacin for some sort of acute arthritis flare and taking two ibuprofen in the morning, you know what I mean? One is super strong and one is not, and ibuprofen only lasts for a few hours so a few doses is not a big deal in the grand scheme of things... but taking it 3x daily for months is not ideal.  There's a lot of debate on the subject mentioned, because the research doesn't show an overall increase in mass gained, just a short term acceleration in protein synthesis that allows us to regain our recent losses.  This could be happening by temporarily increased myonuclear density on the fibers that are undergoing minor disuse atrophy.  I'm not aware of any research suggesting that there is an actual advantage to repeatedly doing this, but I'm also not aware of any research that has done a 12 month trial on something like this to compare results with a control group that exercises the whole time.  Sometimes these effects happen simply because people are able to keep underlying injuries under better control, and as a result their overall training time does go better.   There could be something to this beyond the short term compensation, but I don't think there's substantial hard scientific evidence to support the idea.  If it works, you know how it is... go with what actually works in real life, and hope that someday someone can get some research going that actually helps us find the proper explanation for WHY it works."

My knees, other than an injury from powerlifting years ago, feel fine.  Now I'm not saying to trash your body by forcing yourself into positions you can't yet handle. Pay attention to how your body is reacting, modify positions so that you can more readily handle them, and you'll create an environment for healthy adaptation.   In my experiences, most sources on the internet encourage you to hold yourself back from faster progress because they don't want to get sued if you snap shit up.

If 99/100 people don't get bothered by something and you do, guess what:  You're either doing it wrong OR you're one of the people who just can't tolerate what you're trying to do.

And the connective tissue that holds your knee together is not intended to twist like that. I would never recommend anyone to just go straight into pigeon pose, especially if it's their tight hip, as that can and will damage the knee.   When i do these stretches i can feel some strain on the knee and afterwards i can feel my knee ligaments popping and sliding    You shouldn't be doing these stretches if you feel strain in your knee joint.  You want to choose stretches that help you feel the stretch closer to the muscle belly.  For example, I would much rather you begin with thread-the-needle which is like pigeon pose on your back and the risk of twisting the knee is far less.  Then move onto this stretch that targets the same piriformis/glutes as well.  Then and only then, should you go into pigeon pose. But again, even if you warm up with those other stretches, if you still feel any strain in the knee, you are not ready for pigeon."

Its easy to pull something when you dont have the prerequisite flexibility when doing pigeon. If you are stretching properly you shouldnt feel any strain/pain afterwards.

The body position (except for shoulders) is completely identical at the bottom position. However, you will not really be able to feel that until you have the (shoulder) strength to extend your legs even further out.  Also, I say a great deal of people not knowing how to push the pelvis to posterior tilt. That may also be the reason why so many people neglect this exercise for front lever specific training. Hollow holds will help you to learn correct positioning of the pelvis.  I agree that in the beginning it is all about shoulder strength. Front lever can basically be muscled through by many individuals, but splitting up the core and the shoulder work is a ticket for success, eventually"
bodyweightfitness,3e2jgf,AlexanderEgebak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:29:22 2015 UTC,so we should aim for posterior pelvic tilt in the front lever? and dragon flags too?
bodyweightfitness,3e2jgf,akidwhoplaysguitar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:23:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, that principle also applies to a lot of other exercises like planks, pull ups, push ups etc."
bodyweightfitness,3e2jgf,AlexanderEgebak,2,Tue Jul 21 20:42:56 2015 UTC,"You don't have enough lat strength, that's for sure. You need to be working on pull ups, L sit pull ups, and weighted pull ups for that. I also highly recommend seated cable rows.  As far as the core strength, you need to learn hollow holds before anything else. My suggestions are hollow holds for skill and decline weighted sit ups for strength.   Together, those comprise a complete FL training package.   The progressions are a joke when you train basic strength properly and focus there."
bodyweightfitness,3e2jgf,Joshua_Naterman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:01:48 2015 UTC,"I would do hollow body holds first to work on proper pelvis position and core strengthening. While you do that you can practice pull ups for shoulder strength. When you can do both pull ups and full hollow body holds for reps and time easily you are ready for the next step.  Now you can do dragon flags (aka body levers). Work your way through negative variations and end up doing them with overhead support (like a bar from a smith machine). Now you also weight your pull ups or do harder variations working towards wide grip L pull up.  The final step should now be relatively easy. Flat tuck front lever should be easy. Next work on extending your legs downwards so that you reduce your pike and stop when you hit posterior pelvis tilt position. Now work on putting the legs together.  This approach is somewhat similar to what is taught over at GB, just watered down with a few personal adjustments, so the method is proven. If you have any questions feel free to ask"

bodyweightfitness,3dy8k9,Xander667,2,Mon Jul 20 17:47:54 2015 UTC,I thought some of the purpose behind all of that access is so that your app knows when to pause itself or turn off its volume or whatever. So if you get a call or a text or start to make a Skype call the app knows to shut itself up. But I am no expert
bodyweightfitness,3dy8k9,Antranik,10,Mon Jul 20 20:32:13 2015 UTC,"This was literally because I was using a plugin called ""cordova media plugin"". Its job is to allow you to use all the media functions of the phone, which means by default it asks for a lot of permissions like access to the microphone.  This app only uses the ""play"" functionality and didn't require all the extra permissions. Turns out there was  a ""far"" simpler way of getting audio to work without the media plugin, and the app now uses that :)"
bodyweightfitness,3dy8k9,mazurio,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:38:24 2015 UTC,"When another app takes over, your app gets an interrupt notification and then you can tell it to shut up. No need to monitor the microphone for that."

Can you have the videos pause when you swipe left? So there's not more than one playing at a time. I'm sure if I were actually doing the routine along with it, that would not be an issue so it may not be that important.  Are you planning to put in the more advanced moves?

bodyweightfitness,3dzb4f,Shovez,2,Mon Jul 20 19:18:28 2015 UTC,"Is it fine to start the recommend routine using rings only even if you are weak (I can't do a single clean pull up)?   Yes. The main issue with rings training comes with people attempting to do advanced elements like iron crosses, and other straight arm elements, before their tendons are properly prepared to be able to handle the stress. Thats not a problem w/ pullups.    I read that rings are better for joint health as they allow you to move more naturally but are inferior to bars for pure hypertrophy - is this true?   I have not heard anything like this. Hypertrophy is more of a function of working against a max amount of resistance... its possible that you can recruit more muscles by using rings because you can move around more, but I just haven't heard about this. Its probably a negligible difference in the long run."
bodyweightfitness,3dzb4f,randomaccount1451435,4,Mon Jul 20 22:34:24 2015 UTC,"Yes that all sounds okay. Some suggestions: You could start with chin ups (palms facing you) or neutral (palms facing each other) rather than pull ups (palms facing away) as it may be easier. Be patient with the support hold as it takes time to have a solid RTO position. That's the biggest difference in terms of (in)stability as anything done above the rings is much harder (and more gratifying when you could do it!). If you want to do muscle ups one day, work on your false grip hang so you could eventually do false grip chin ups as that's necessary to help you."

bodyweightfitness,3e0l64,AnonymousWritings,2,Tue Jul 21 03:24:49 2015 UTC,"I find the l-sit variations on the pull-up are a good thing to work towards before weighting them. Shifting the weight in front of you works the scap musculature much more when pulling out of the dead hang, and working them has made the regular pull-up trivially easier."
bodyweightfitness,3e0l64,34215527015,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:15:37 2015 UTC,"I tried (tuck) L-sit pullups for the first time (intentionally) yesterday. The first two sets of 5 with the pull-up grip were hard, but do-able. I went to the third set and switched to a chin-up grip and I felt like I was flying over the bar. I was easily pulling up to where the bar was well below my clavicle, and honestly felt like I had more in me (stopped at 5 reps though).  These were easier than normal pull-ups (or chin-ups) have been in the past.  Any idea why this might have happened?"
bodyweightfitness,3e0l64,AnonymousWritings,2,Tue Jul 21 14:17:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe you were unintentionally using a bit of momentum from your tuck. Like when you ""cheat"" doing your last reps of pullups and you kind of lift your knees to give you that extra lift."
bodyweightfitness,3e0l64,_k4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:19:34 2015 UTC,"Maybe. I know I usually do a bit of that with normal pullups; with these it felt like they were more strict form as intentionally holding my legs in a tuck-L-sit gave me a cue to keep that position, rather than flailing around like a dieing fish."
bodyweightfitness,3e0l64,Buckyx,2,Tue Jul 21 14:28:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other chap, it's almost certainly from accidental momentum/kipping. At the bottom of a tuck L-Sit pull up it's easy to loosen the tuck becuase the abs have to work so hard to keep the knees high as you hit the bottomof the hang, so if you pullup from there straight away you're very likely to squeeze abs and re-tuck the knees giving you a bit of a kip.   I like to wait at the bottom before my next rep for a pause, until totally still before the next pull, in order to get the most from this exercise."

It will just feel worse than when you're warmed up. For moulding mobility I don't think you need to warm up, just ease into your reps.

I really don't know what he means by that, but his programming has lead to results flexibility wise in the past for me, so I'm inclined to keep with it. He also mentions that we should be thinking about things in a 6 months to a year timeline, so it'd probably be more appropriate to address this after a while to see whether there were results or not."

bodyweightfitness,3dylwg,Joshua_Naterman,2,Mon Jul 20 20:38:57 2015 UTC,"Slow progressive loading, always making sure training never hurts.  The likelihood of the tendon tearing is almost zero, but the likelihood of developing bursitis or long-term tendinopathies is what you should really be worried about.  I have people do one of two things, based on what they prefer.  1) Diamond push ups. You have to progress these slowly and only do what never hurts.  2) skull crushers/french press/supine triceps extensions (use whatever name you like, I prefer Skull Crushers). Same parameters as above, but you progress weights slowly.  In general, tendons respond better to explosive forces that don't last very long. It's just easier to generate a better adaptive response without hurting yourself.  The reasons for this really come from ""basic concepts"" in materials engineering such as ""stress/strain curves"" which are worth reading about if you really want to understand.  If you just want to execute correctly, I suggest starting with one or both of the exercises I mentioned and only do a few reps. Build up slowly over time, never allowing yourself to progress at a rate that causes pain or discomfort.   I have worked with tons of people on this, and this approach has never yet failed to practically work miracles. It's basic, easy, and it works. Period."

bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,howtospeak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:32:46 2015 UTC,What % would that be?
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,Shaferyy,5,Mon Jul 20 14:20:21 2015 UTC,"There's no set number because everyone's different. Partly it does indeed depend on how much muscle you have (much thicker/stronger abs will poke through fat a little more than untrained/weaker ones), but also because everyone stores fat differently.  As a ballpark number, abs start becoming visible below 15% and at 10-12% are legitimate 6-packs. You can see tons of pictures by googling ""body fat percentage men (or women)"" and you'll see how different 10% can look in a scrawny teenager vs a bodybuilder."
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,DrDerpberg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:18:08 2015 UTC,"Just a reference, I'm at 12% and they're starting to show. Not super defined yet but I imagine 10% they will start to show more."
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,DrDerpberg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:13 2015 UTC,"How did you measure? Keep in mind most methods you can do at home are still pretty inaccurate. They're useful as far as keeping track of progress though - if you were 15% last year and 10% now you've leaned out, whether the real numbers are correct or 20%-15%."
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,i_ball_daily_G,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:28:28 2015 UTC,"Well, I went to the gym and used the handheld thing. I've also used the scale. I'm aware the accuracy can vary, but I also know that no matter how you measure, there is always a little inaccuracy. 12%-14% seens about right though. The last fat I have is my stomach fat. 😭"
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,Moroni123,-6,Mon Jul 20 18:20:04 2015 UTC,"Very true on the ""where fat is stored"" part. I have always had very low body fat around 4-5% in high school and now around 7%. But due to genetics the majority of my body fat is stored around my stomach so my stomach just looks flat, I've never had defined abs dispite Rock Climbing for 7 years and now doing BWF."
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,DrDerpberg,7,Mon Jul 20 18:42:20 2015 UTC,"lol most pro body-builders are 6-7% when stage ready, claiming you were 4-5% without even trying but still no visible abs is one of the dumbest things I've read, doesn't matter if you have the worst genetics in history at 4% you're abs would be incredibly defined"
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,i_ball_daily_G,2,Mon Jul 20 22:23:46 2015 UTC,"How have you measured it? 4-5% is basically bodybuilder contest form and isn't usually possible to maintain for more than a few hours without severe health effects. Even at 7% you're crazy low. Most people get ""shredded"" around 9-10% - not just lean, but not an ounce of visible body fat."
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,MacintoshEddie,-2,Mon Jul 20 19:01:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have one of those electronic scales, not sure how accurate they are, but I think I remember hearing the were more accurate than just pinching your stomach with one of those devices"
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,MacintoshEddie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:30:25 2015 UTC,I would hazard a guess that if you did tend to store the majority of your fat in your stomach you would have a potbelly like those guys who look like they are pregnant.  Having a flat stomach but no ab definition sounds like just having small undeveveloped abs.
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,Osmialignaria,76,Tue Jul 21 14:02:49 2015 UTC,"Having larger and more developed abs will make them easier to see, but honestly we're probably talking about 1-2% bodyfat difference."
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,MacintoshEddie,44,Mon Jul 20 00:23:57 2015 UTC,1-2% body fat difference from what? I'm not sure what you mean.
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,Osmialignaria,67,Mon Jul 20 02:39:23 2015 UTC,"Difference from where an ""average"" person would have visible abs.  Say if the average person has visible abs at 12% bodyfat, by focusing extra effort on abs you may have visible abs at around 14% bodyfat.  It's not really an exact science."
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,top_procrastinator,16,Mon Jul 20 04:09:28 2015 UTC,Ah. Got what you mean now. Thanks!
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,Paradox621,2,Mon Jul 20 05:50:49 2015 UTC,"I definitely believe my abs look better because of ab workouts, but one weekend of not sticking to my diet and I lose a ton of definition. I went to Vegas for 5 days and didn't workout or pay attention to diet and I lost a lot of definition but I'm sure I didn't lose any muscle mass, so now I guess I just need to cut the fat back down a few % or so."
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,daybreakin,35,Mon Jul 20 16:33:07 2015 UTC,Well-built abs can potentially show at a slightly higher body fat % than they would otherwise. The actual numbers vary on an individual basis.
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,MacintoshEddie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:44:49 2015 UTC,Can people who have too much fat but have abs feel them by poking through the flesh
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,AnonymousWritings,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:06:39 2015 UTC,"Everyone has abs under the fat, except perhaps for the occasional person born with a serious deformity.    As for being able to feel them under the fat, I can, and mine are not visible at all.  It comes down to how much subcutaneous fat is between the skin and muscle.  I would hazard that 30% bodyfat would probably be near the point where a person can't poke their stomach and feel abs underneath."

bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,AnalogKid425,12,Mon Jul 20 05:57:37 2015 UTC,Just throwing in a few more ab questions:  At what percentage should my abs show?   I am at 12-13% now. Should I work on lowering my percentage or building bigger abs?
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,wodenokoto,21,Mon Jul 20 03:54:02 2015 UTC,How are you measuring your bodyfat percentage? Make sure you are accurately 12-13%  Are you male or female? Percentage of showing is different depending on gender. Also varies person to person for different body reasons but there are ranges for revealing depending upon %bodyfat for men and women
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,Tube-Alloys,11,Mon Jul 20 04:06:15 2015 UTC,"I'm male, completely forgot to mention that, since that makes a huge difference.   I measure on one of those machines at my gym, that sends currents through your body. It's a pretty big one where you also hold things in your hand.   I have always wondered how food affects those measurements. If I drink a liter of water, my weight goes up 1 kilo, but my fat stays the same, essentially lowering it as a percentage, I wonder."
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,coopster,30,Mon Jul 20 04:44:04 2015 UTC,"Those machines are notoriously inaccurate, though I can't speak to their precision."

bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,Konstrukt1,10,Mon Jul 20 19:29:38 2015 UTC,"Yep, the key is body fat %, however if you have nothing it will look awful, think Twilight, the vampire guy, not so much washboard as whiteboard.   The other thing is that there are more than just the central abs, there are the obliques and so on, other abdominal muscles which add to the appearance a lot but are often neglected. You want to look at all the core exercises as each does something different, for example leg raises work on the lower abs, while side/oblique crunches do exactly what they sound like, they work the sides of your core."
bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,reigorius,18,Mon Jul 20 05:50:50 2015 UTC,"Great answers so far. I would add: The main reasons to do ab exercises (or, more generally, core exercises) are:   They'll strengthen you for pretty much every exercise that involves the whole body, be it in gymnastics or heavy weightlifting (like squats). A strong core helps prevent injuries in many activities. They counteract many negative sideffects of a sedentary lifestyle (bad posture, etc.)."

bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,manys,5,Mon Jul 20 14:11:39 2015 UTC,"My go to core exercises are planks and bridges.   Planks get intense much more quickly than cranking out a million crunches, and there's a huge amount of variations you can do. I'd recommend starting out with regular planks + side planks. If you can hold a regular plank reasonably long, intensify by extending an arm, a leg, or even both. This guy demonstrates all the variations mentioned above, and several more: https://youtu.be/sl1bUFj1a44  Bridges are great to strengthen the muscles in your back that weaken from sitting a lot. I'd recommend starting slowly on them if you haven't done them before, to avoid injury. This is a good progression: https://youtu.be/6lhZpOKk3oo"

After graduating college and thus no longer training for a collegiate sport and now sitting at a desk almost all day every day, my posture has gone to shit. Started having back problems, had to stop working out.  Started working with a personal trainer and our focus has been core stability and getting the proper muscles to fire for certain movements and also unlocking shoulders, upper back, and arms.  I'm really amazed at how bad I got in such a short time frame and how much the work I've been doing has helped.

bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,Exodus111,15,Mon Jul 20 15:34:14 2015 UTC,This is correct.

bodyweightfitness,3dw0x1,fucky0urkarma,3,Mon Jul 20 18:04:49 2015 UTC,1) BF percent tests done for high school wrestling are usually terrible.  Performed by an untrained nurse or referee with calipers  2) Low body fat alone isn't enough.  I'm sure he had very low muscle mass as well

bodyweightfitness,3dz5u8,40cakeslices,6,Mon Jul 20 18:41:14 2015 UTC,absolutely not. They're not even close to being similar.  Retract the scapula means squeeze your shoulder blades together. There are examples on youtube.
bodyweightfitness,3dz5u8,S_M2,4,Mon Jul 20 19:00:27 2015 UTC,why would you do that? they are both completely different exercises and you can do them both for benefits  depress - pushing scapulas down retract - pushing scapulas together
bodyweightfitness,3dz5u8,Buckyx,5,Mon Jul 20 18:47:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't replace rows with them. I treated them like skill work though and worked on them casually.  Setup in the row: with your arms straight, before you initiate the actual row, pinch your shoulder blades back together (retract) and if your shoulders are hiking up, bring them down, away from the ears (depression).  Now, pull to bring your chest up to the bar/rings."
bodyweightfitness,3dz5u8,Antranik,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:59:33 2015 UTC,TIL I've been rowing wrong all along. Trying to achieve that pinch at the top of the pull is a different beast entirely.
bodyweightfitness,3dxswt,inferno1234,3,Mon Jul 20 12:27:41 2015 UTC,"Obviously: I don't know your father's specifics and see a doctor for medical advice.  I think this is awesome! He will be motivated to workout beside you. It is totally feasible for him to do the recommended routine, because each exercise has a wide range of progressions to help you from worm strength to gorilla strength. Just be sure he picks the appropriate level of resistance. I think planks will be a good way for him to work on strength and stability in his hips - focus hard on proper alignment and posterior pelvic tilt. If he cannot hold the correct position, have him elevate his hands until he can. Same goes for pushups and rows. The scalability of this routine is great for rehab and hardcore training alike. Good luck! I wish him the best!"
bodyweightfitness,3dxswt,shul0k,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:45:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response, I just looked through the routine again and indeed,there are very low leven progressions available.  with respect to the planks, you mean elevate the hands as in not doing them on the ground but doing them against the wall? i can see how this works for a push up and planks, but for the row i have difficulty imagining it?"
bodyweightfitness,3dxswt,shul0k,2,Mon Jul 20 12:50:29 2015 UTC,"For a row being more horizontal means pulling more of your weight. The absolute easiest is to stand in front of a doorway with your arms grasping the wall in front of you and pulling - it takes little effort. The hard part will be gradually lowering the hands. If you use rings or a bar in a power rack/smith machine you can incrementally lower the hold and bring yourself closer to horizontal as strength progresses. Does that make it more clear?  I agree with StuWard that he should prioritize useful movements such as getting up. My mother has an artificial hip, and I work with her on lunges."
bodyweightfitness,3dxswt,shul0k,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:46:10 2015 UTC,"yes it does! and lunges seem like a good idea, although i am not very experienced in them as I myself do not workout my legs in a normal fashion. thanks for your help."
bodyweightfitness,3dxswt,Toast-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:48:49 2015 UTC,"The great thing I find with lunges is that they are really easy to get the technique right. It's just a step forward with slightly more bend in the knees. There's more possible, but you can begin with just a big step. I started my mom with squats, but they involve a little more technique and I wasn't going to be there to help her every time."
bodyweightfitness,3dxswt,StuWard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:58:46 2015 UTC,"For several of the exercises you can check out this diagram to see what kind of progressions you can have him do. It's taken from Convict Conditioning, but a lot of it can transfer to the recommended routine. The only thing to note off the top of my head is that I would avoid knee push-ups and just change height instead.  http://www.4hourlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Convict-Conditioning-Progressions-Wall-Chart.jpg"
bodyweightfitness,3dxswt,StuWard,2,Tue Jul 21 02:04:52 2015 UTC,"You need to start where you're comfortable and increase gradually.  If the recommended program allows you to do that, go ahead.    For older individuals, you need to be smart about your exercise, mostly because you want to maximise the usefulness of the results.  The basic movements, push, pull, squat, hinge and carry are all important.    Look at the movements that you or your father use in everyday life, either routinely or in an emergency.  The ability to get up off the floor is essential.  Therefore, practice this.  Getting up from a chair is the same movement as squatting.  Do it assisted, unassisted, holding a weight, etc.  Handstands are likely not required.  Lifting a weight overhead may be."

bodyweightfitness,3dyte2,jessamina,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:14:11 2015 UTC,Do you have a staircase or a chair? Think of it more like a step down.  Start at the top and reach down with your heel until you hit an object of varying height.

bodyweightfitness,3dxirz,bajec210,2,Mon Jul 20 12:26:59 2015 UTC,I think the ROM is fine. If I lock out my arms my elbows start to hurt after a couple reps. You're not kipping and depth isn't that bad. You could increase ROM but I don't think it's a problem.
bodyweightfitness,3dxirz,samson8567,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:49:02 2015 UTC,It actually is a problem. You should be using full ROM WITH every exercise and if you can't then you need to back off a progression. The reason your elbows hurt is because you are probably too weak to be doing pull ups.
bodyweightfitness,3dxirz,bajec210,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:23:06 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. You should be doing full ROM, as that's the correct way to do the exercise. I think he's doing full ROM, but that's my opinion because I don't find locking out arms comfortable.  Interesting enough, my elbows only hurt during fully extended  hang in chin up position. I don't run into any problems during pull ups. Perhaps because I rarely do chin ups during my workouts.  EDIT: OK, last few reps could be improved a bit, but I still stand behind my statement as far as first couple reps are concerned."

A few extra sets are not going to be a disaster, but this goes against the recovery principle inherent in the routine.  Maybe move Fri to Sat and treat yourself to an afternoon workout 1x/wk."
bodyweightfitness,3dyjci,occamsracer,0,Mon Jul 20 16:34:18 2015 UTC,"That recovery principle is what I was curious about... obviously a second workout in the afternoon would ruin just about any Monday daytime recovery, but I'd always be sure to give myself the next day as a full recovery (Light running Tues/Thurs, no plans Sat/Sun).

bodyweightfitness,3dyjci,calyp5e,2,Mon Jul 20 16:40:33 2015 UTC,You could split your workout by doing the exercises you can do in the morning (excluding push-ups and pull-ups) and doing pull-ups and push-ups after work. (Or do what you're currently doing as it won't affect anything.)

bodyweightfitness,3dyjci,PhilipChubb,0,Mon Jul 20 21:07:21 2015 UTC,"As long as you're amply warmed up (which is more for prevention of injuries than it being necessary), doing additional push-ups/pull-ups after work some days will not significantly, if at all, affect how much mass/strength you get in the long run.  This and this are good bwf posts on hypertrophy. And try to ensure you're eating enough as without that you won't achieve your goal."
bodyweightfitness,3dyjci,MarkFromTheInternet,2,Mon Jul 20 21:16:10 2015 UTC,"Depending on your central nervous system and fiber type, I believe, you may find it better to train at a particular time of day. I am a morning person and I absolutely suck at night time workouts. Others are the opposite.  Another thing is an earlier workout can ""prime"" you for the second one especially if it is done with the right time spread in between.  Twice a day workouts a great tool if you do them right. Heavier and harder training in the morning followed by higher volume in the second workout."

But I'd be happy to expand.   A topic you can look up is neurological efficiency which is a fancy way of saying how good your body is at activating all your muscles at once in the right order. Imagine a tug of war match were all teammates are pulling strong (neurologically efficient) vs some teammates pulling now and some pulling later etc (neurologically inefficient.  Neurologically efficient people tend to be better at training in the morning and inefficient tend to need more hours awake to ""wake up"" their nervous system.   I'm sure there are studies on it somewhere but the befonning of this article explains neurological efficiency vs muscle mass a bit."
bodyweightfitness,3dyjci,Buckyx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:44:21 2015 UTC,"Considering that my goal is weight gain and hypertrophy, does it make sense to complete the Recommended Routine in the mornings MWF, and (when I'm disciplined enough to do so) complete an extra few sets of pull-ups & diamond-ups later the same day?   Record and track your progress, and keep notes on what is sore. Going twice a day will give you more practice at those particular movements, and if it doesn't exceed your ability to recover you'll get stronger, faster.   But if that's too much volume / not enough recovery, your body won't be able to adapt and you don't get stronger."

There are potential side effects though like all drugs, some of which are definitely not good for athletics.    Honestly, no one is going to be able to tell you how tall you will end up being before the age of about 23(when most males stop growing entirely).    I was 5'4 at 17 though and 5'9'' at 18 so who knows.   I will say this though.  Make sure to eat good food.  The biggest factor in size is food.  Want to be big and tall, eat up.

Obviously any chalistenics program thinks dips and pullups are important so that's what we start with. Over at /r/fitness, the powerlifting programs (SS,SL) start with squats for the same reason.

However, hands further forward is harder.  One-foot supported with what I think is normal hand position is not too challenging at the moment, but tuck L-sits are very rough (5s hold MAYBE).  Is it a valid progression to just work my hands forward in one foot supported until tuck L-sits seem more do-able?  Dips and Pullups:  I find that these tax me a lot more than other exercises. Doing a hard set of push-ups might make my chest sore, but the rest of my body is fine. Doing a hard set of Dips or Pullups basically makes my entire body feel tired.

bodyweightfitness,3dx70p,kvicksand,4,Mon Jul 20 10:09:50 2015 UTC,You should always to the harder exercise for one muscle group (f.e. pull ups) before the relatively easier exercise (rows) if it is not for warm up. Otherwise you will be to exhausted after the easier exercise to perform well enough on the more difficult exercise. Also some time to regenerate between exercises for the same muscle group is fine and boosts performance. So the way you do it atm is fine.

After some time of training I am now able to hold a slightly tucked L-Sit for about 10-15 seconds, and I'm sure I will get the full L-Sit soon enough. But what about the Advanced L-Sit (or maybe even things like L-Sit to Handstand)? My arms simply don't reach the ground if I put my shoulders and my back into the position required for an advanced L-Sit? Is there something I'm missing out or do I definitely have to switch to advanced L-Sit on rings and parallel bars then?"

Because even if I depress my shoulders as strong as possible against air, they don't get low enough. Or should I still lean forward, but with retracted shoulders? I thought until now that in an advanced L-Sit, it is required to also maintain a straight back while holding a right angle between legs and torso.  For some visualisation: I am not able to do the staff pose in yoga (http://www.yogaoutlet.com/userfiles/Guide/image/Yoga/Yoga_SeatedStaffPose_01_300x350.jpg), because my hands won't reach deep enough, they stay about 3-5cm off the ground, no matter how much I depress."

bodyweightfitness,3dx70p,Antranik,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:05:24 2015 UTC,"Question about dips on rings.   I can pump out a lot of P-bar dips. I used to do them a lot when I was lifting heavy in the gym, and can still do multiple sets with 90 lbs around my waist.   Over the past four weeks I've gotten my RTO support to between 20 and 30 seconds at a time.   I've started doing dips on the rings, but I can't for the life of me get back in to good RTO position at the top. I know rings naturally gravitate towards muscular balance, so I feel it a LOT in my front deltoids. Pretty much the only way I can do dips on the rings is in that ""crappy"" support position with the rings turned almost backwards towards my body, struggling as hard as I can to get some scapular depression at the top. I can barely push out three sets of 5 like this (rings turned in, leaning into straps, etc.).   So the question: should I just keep doing these and trying to turn out as much as possible at the top? I've been getting stronger, because two weeks ago I could barely do one dip on the rings, but I'm wondering if there's something else I should be doing to help build into ring dips with better technique."

Recently, whenever I've tried any new workout I usually end up so sore two days later that I can't get up off the toilet or out of my chair at work without serious grandma-ing.  It hurts to walk and do everything. The DOMS are so intense that I literally cannot pick up my child to change his diaper.

Underestimating caloric value of snacks, overestimating how much you burn during a workout, not counting snacks (or drinks for that matter) can all lead into thinking you're eating at a deficit when you're not.

bodyweightfitness,3dw9aa,BeholdTheArctopus,0,Mon Jul 20 03:13:02 2015 UTC,I have a hard time believing this is asked in earnest.   Watch an olympic sprinting video and see what they do after they cross the line. Just stop trying to go fast and let your momentum die down while still doing the running motion. It's easy and low stress on your muscles/joints.   Stopping suddenly makes about as much sense as slamming on the brakes from max speed every time you get to a stop sign (no sense).

bodyweightfitness,3dtra4,sammyboi55,16,Sun Jul 19 17:04:37 2015 UTC,"I have a set up like that, the only thing that bothers me is that the bar swings too much.   It doesn't swing in normal pull ups, you can get used to it pretty easily, but you'll have a hard time doing any kind of muscle ups, hanging leg raises, stuff like that, it just swing so much. It requires you to actively stabilize it, but this adds a few more variables if you are already training for a technical move."
bodyweightfitness,3dtra4,novarising,7,Sun Jul 19 15:00:28 2015 UTC,No. Try to reduce swing but it's not a big deal as it doesn't lead to kipping any more than a rigid bar.
bodyweightfitness,3dtra4,mywifeletsmereddit,7,Sun Jul 19 12:29:14 2015 UTC,"No, but depending on how the bar is attached to the rope you may experience that the bar can ""roll"" in your hands when your grip begins getting tired. This is not a problem unless you hang on the bar for longer period of times."

bodyweightfitness,3dtra4,Bl4nkface,2,Sun Jul 19 17:00:33 2015 UTC,Would installing the bar at the bottom of a rope that comes to a V reduce the amount is swing? Like V__V ? I imagine there would still be side to side movement but that might cut down on the back and forth. Possibly wrap the rope around the bar or drill a hole through or use some other method to fix the bar to the rope in one place.
bodyweightfitness,3dtra4,OperationJericho,4,Sun Jul 19 18:28:01 2015 UTC,"If you want to reduce the side to side movement as well, make the V's slanted.

bodyweightfitness,3du183,scotchT,14,Sun Jul 19 13:39:22 2015 UTC,"Skeptical massage therapist here. Absolutely do not worry about this. As you say, the evidence for ""muscle knots"" and trigger point therapy is very weak. You are not even experiencing pain, yet your therapist is telling you to be worried and subjecting you to painful treatment. Nocebo much?  I hear stories all the time from massage clients of things they have been told by other therapists, chiros, etcs. ""I have bad posture. I have knots. I have joints 'out.'"" The list goes on. None of these things have clinical relevance, even if the client has pain. We need to do a lot better at talking about the causes of pain and dysfunction. Lorimer Moseley is a good place to start.   *That's not to say someone might not benefit from digging around on muscle knots. But the mechanism for why that might benefit someone has more to do with sensitization and DNIC/counterirritation than trigger point theory. Regardless, this thing where a therapist makes you worried about a non-problem should stop."

bodyweightfitness,3du183,lets_make_this_weird,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:26:47 2015 UTC,"I think it is ""all in you head"" but maybe in a more complicated way than you're thinking. Pain is the feeling your brain creates when it senses a threat (see the Mosley video). If you have a nagging pain and irritate it further ala trigger point therapy, you are creating a lot more sensation, but you know that no real damage is happening. So your brain reinterprets the sensation in a less threatening way. Therefore, you have less pain."
bodyweightfitness,3du183,Jimmyboy89,2,Mon Jul 20 01:58:15 2015 UTC,I like that explanation. Since it's not actually relieving the knots is there a way to? Top of my bum and under my left shoulder blade are where they always happen.
bodyweightfitness,3du183,lets_make_this_weird,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:03:27 2015 UTC,"It's not an easy answer, but the first thing to do is stop calling them knots. ;-)   If you're trying to eliminate knots, I don't think you'll ever succeed. Everybody has places that nag, are maybe a little lumpy, and hurt when you press on them. When things hurt, we tend to think there must be something wrong. This is not always a good assumption. So I suggest reframing the issue cognitively.  Instead of pesky muscle knots we want to get rid of, let's try a different framework. Maybe call it ""sensitized tissue."" Those spots have a history that has left them feeling threatened. Maybe it's an old injury, maybe it's a repetitive motion that you can't avoid doing. Whatever it is, the body is interpreting the sensation it's getting from there as threatening. The pain you get may range from discomfort to extreme pain. Either way, it's telling you to slow down and be careful. You, however, have some leeway in how to interpret this message.  If you start from a place of ""pain means something wrong is happening,"" that leaves you with one set of options - try to find a biomechanical fix somehow. But if you start from another place - ""pain sometimes means something wrong is happening"" then you have a different set of options. You can now cognitively explore whether there is an actual danger happening in those spots. In most cases, what people call knots pose little risk of injury or dysfunction. If you are at all in doubt, seek qualified care.   If you decide that muscle knots don't pose a safety threat, do you see how your mind may change how it interprets the irritating sensory information? It will probably bother you less. There are other things you can do.    manage general stress and depression get adequate exercise - regular movement throughout the day and some intense work too get good sleep do some strengthening and mobilization in the affected areas - This is another way of assuring your brain that your body is resilient and strong, even when there is some discomfort.   Tl;dr - Most important thing to help with irritation associated with ""muscle knots"" is to understand that there probably isn't any real damage or dysfunction happening there. Consult a qualified medical practitioner to help you be certain you do not have a more serious condition.   Better, broader, and sourced version of what I said includes great intro to pain science and has sections on posture and muscular inhibition."

bodyweightfitness,3dt0lc,Subercool,3,Sun Jul 19 11:43:09 2015 UTC,"I'm doing the beginner routine and have slightly changed my approach over time when I'd realize I was doing something incorrectly....I do pairs now instead of one exercise after another because it's more time efficient to do one exercise while resting from another. I do the routine every other day.   Start with dynamic stretching, 5 minutes of plank work, ten minutes of handstand work. Honestly my butt was too big for me do l-sits so I didn't dedicate any time to them. However, I'll probably start working on them now along with my handstands   The Start Bodyweight Routine   I stalk /u/antranik and other random tutorials on YouTube to learn and improve my form   I do dips and push-ups every workout, against the recommendation of Start Bodyweight Training   I do 3 sets of my max reps with the highest progression that I can complete with quality. As soon I lose quality, I stop. So now that I pair the exercises, I would do leg lifts and then while resting from that, do my first set of push-ups, and when resting from push-ups I go back to leg lifts and then follow this pattern with the rest of the exercises. I pair the exercises push/pull and upper body/lower body, if that makes sense. Basically I just make sure to not do pairs of exercises that use the same muscles because then my rest from one move while doing another isn't really a rest!   On non-strength training days I do something active for at least 30 minutes, whether a hike, walk, yoga, Jillain Michaels or Insanity video. I've been doing sprint workouts twice a week for the last month. Also, after finishing my second month of BWF I took an entire week off and only went on two hikes and did no resistance training.      Diet: 100-120 grams of protein a day and a net calorie intake of 1500-1700 (I say net because I'd eat more on days with long hikes). According to an online TDEE calculator I could eat 2100 to maintain and I've found this to be pretty accurate. I use MFP to track my food. 5-6 reasonably portioned meals a day. I eat eggs, chicken, cabbage (I'm obsessed with coleslaw), greens, some fruit but mostly just bananas and frozen strawberries, corn tortillas, protein bars, cheese sticks, peanut butter, Kerrygold butter, Dave's Killler bread, oatmeal cooked with egg whites, and if I want a treat I eat a treat. I've had less and less desire for sugary stuff the more time goes by, but just sayin' if peanut m&m's give me a call, I answer. My last meal of the day is usually a protein shake made with protein powder, a banana, ice and water. If I absolutely neeeeeed a snack later in the night I do an apple or a couple cups of air-popped popcorn. I never let myself do anything or commit to any plan or ideal if I know it will contribute to a binge. I want slow and steady progress that lasts and contributes to mental stability. Fuck diets and eating disorders. Also I drink a lot of water and make good sleep a priority. And If I drink I do a coors lite or 4 ounce glass of red wine."

bodyweightfitness,3dt0lc,ImChrisBrown,2,Sun Jul 19 14:54:30 2015 UTC,"Never had the issue, heck, I've never done it on pbars. Just focus on pushing the earth away and getting maximum lift in an L-sit. You'll get it soon!"
bodyweightfitness,3dt0lc,mikegymnastics,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:12:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's much harder to do on the ground. Its a recognized skill in gymnastics, either an A or B, can't remember. The key is actually flexibility and strong hip flexors.   You must improve your pike stretch, but also improve the actual strength of your hips. I forgot what the exercisers are called, just look up how to improve your ""compression""."

bodyweightfitness,3dt0lc,slamjeez,3,Mon Jul 20 23:09:13 2015 UTC,shit this is awesome. what was your progression mainly?
bodyweightfitness,3dt0lc,JaysonBourne,2,Sun Jul 19 08:33:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks bro! And honestly i'm not too educated on this stuff haha, but if I were to explain my way of doing it, i'd say the only requirement you need is to be able to do one handstand push up with your elbows at 90 degrees, and your face near the ground. You can even do them tucked since that's the position your body will be in during this manoeuvre,  And the biggest thing for me was leaning forward, for the longest time I was extremely inconsistent with bent arm tucked presses (If that's what they're called) and eventually my friend learned them and just advised leaning forward more and it worked. But just remember the more you lean forward, the closer your face comes to the ground meaning the deeper your handstand push up becomes."

bodyweightfitness,3dt0lc,Crazzymax,3,Sun Jul 19 14:54:46 2015 UTC,How long did it take you to accomplish that? Super cool move.
bodyweightfitness,3dt0lc,JaysonBourne,3,Sun Jul 19 14:37:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks dude, i've been practicing bent arm tucked presses on and off pretty much since I started a couple years ago. I first learned them on flat ground since I find it much much easier on flat possibly due to the grip but i'm not entirely sure.   Then, fairly recently I started going from a handstand into an L sit on P bars, I felt that the negative motion of it would help me do the opposite, which would be an L sit to handstand.   And then, for the longest time I could never hold the handstand after the L sit, i'd press up, my legs would get up in the air, and my body would just naturally come back down. I must've done this at least five hundred times before finally realizing that I had to lean forward a bit more, and work on my control. I used to just rush into it and immediately and frantically kick my legs up in the air hoping they would stay there but soon realized I had to slow it down a little and control my body on the way up.  So all in all I guess i've been practicing that frustrating press up on and off not too long after I started but only recently have I incorporated the L sit into it."
bodyweightfitness,3dt0lc,Crazzymax,3,Sun Jul 19 15:10:44 2015 UTC,"I still need to work on my hand stands, haven't got a usable wall at the moment so will work on them when I can. L sits I'm nearly there, as well as hollow holds."
bodyweightfitness,3dt0lc,JaysonBourne,2,Sun Jul 19 16:02:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely bro, get both of those down solid then it just becomes a combination of the two."
bodyweightfitness,3dt0lc,Crazzymax,3,Sun Jul 19 16:11:47 2015 UTC,If only it would actually be that simple ;)

bodyweightfitness,3dt0lc,JaysonBourne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:21:34 2015 UTC,"I mainly just practiced the actual move a ton, but I would also do a shitload of handstand push ups. The hardest part of the move is pushing up from that tucked position into the handstand, that requires a bit of strength and once you have that down the rest is easy. I would recommend learning bent arm tucked presses on flatground first.  Just remember to lean forward and don't forget to breathe haha."

bodyweightfitness,3dtov3,Franzisa__,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:38:36 2015 UTC,"It could just be a damaged muscle from overtraining, a strain ligament from unphysiological movements, impingement of your shoulder, a damaged fascia, or even damage to your intervertebral disc. Just to give you a few hints, how complex the typical ""shoulder pain"" is. The common muscles to cause the pain are the thomboids, trapezius and the latissimus dorsi, yet even the rotator cuff muscles can be the cause (most likely the teres major for pullups). And then there's also the musculus erector spinae, which is another 27+ muscles in the deep spine area.  And as himself1892 pointed out, a deload week is a pretty good idea if you haven't had one in some time. Often enough, just giving the damaged area some rest will heal the pain.  And sorry if I misunderstood your question! Shoulder pain sucks. I've definitely had it myself, and it was a horrible experience, as it effectively stops you from training the area in pain, for some time.  If it lasts, you should definitely go see a doctor about it. Get well soon! :)"

bodyweightfitness,3dtmap,tothetopness,4,Sun Jul 19 09:45:42 2015 UTC,"Failing the 9the one counts as only 8 reps.   What you are saying are different techniques to build muscle.  Stopping the set is training to failure.  Subbing with easier push ups is called drop sets.  Holding for as long as possible is called time under tension.  All of these work for different goals. All these will one way or another, allow you to do more push ups. Time under tension will help you get stronger at the bottom part of the push up. Drop set will allow you to get in more reps of push ups to further break your muscle fibres. Stopping the set will allow you to rest more, and do more sets of proper push ups.   If you want to be able to do alot of push ups, drop sets should be the most suitable.  If you are just doing around 10 reps of push ups, do 3 sets of 8 reps of push ups. It will train you to be able to do that many push ups and move on to a harder progression."

Broadly, on straps some things are a lot easier than rings because you can lean into the strap a lot more if that makes sense. For example, pressing into a handstand on straps is actually quite easy which is surprising.  It depends on what style you're training as well.   That being said, having a really solid rings foundation and a good stadler press (along with flexibility) will make learning straps a lot easier.  Send me a PM if you want."

bodyweightfitness,3dshqu,DeltaCypher0,3,Sun Jul 19 00:56:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that list is pretty long for one training session especially if you want to progress fast to those crazy moves. Not saying it impossible to do but your CNS is gonna be fried. Try cutting down the skills you wanna learn to 3, from the looks of it, it looks like planche, one arm pull up and front lever would be your favorite and best choice.  Since you wanna hit leg just as hard, I would suggest a Pull/Push/Leg split, basically Pull/Push/Leg/Pull/Push/Leg/Rest. You can change the order up to your liking. In pull day, you would be doing progressions for OAP and front lever. In push day, you would be doing progressions for planche. Leg day, you just train legs. You can even do purely OAP progression on the first pull day and front lever on the second pull day since those are brutal to train.  Last thing is eliminate unnecessary exercises. Those archer pushup, rows, and OHP is unnecessary. Weighted pull ups is a must to improve overall pull strength and weighted dips is not that helpful for planche. 3 progression exercises for each move is more than enough and any accessory exercises is really not needed."

I am still going with an Upper/Lower split for now, as I really only want to train 4 days a week so I have time for hiking, slacklining, going to concerts etc.  So, today I trained upper body, and did:   Tuck Lever 6x10s Tuck Planche 6x10s 1 Arm Pull Up Negatives 5x2 Archer Pushups 3x12 (moving on to the next progression!)   Then one set of 10 ring pull ups.    It was a longish workout, about 1 hr flat, not including my 20 min warmup mobility and handstand work.  Would it be too little if I only did the tuck lever and tuck planche?  If so, I'm thinking about just adding in straddle 1arm pushups and archer rows for more volume.  Remember this is just one workout.  I am thinking about doing 1 arm pull ups 2-3 times a week all alone by themselves on either ""rest days"" or during my 2 leg workouts.

The answer is that a narrow hand position activates both tris and pecs with greater effect. From the linked study on Pubmed:  ""The EMG activity for subjects' dominant arm pectoralis major and triceps brachii was recorded using surface electrodes. The EMG activity was greater in both muscle groups during push-ups performed from the narrow base hand position compared with the wide base position (p < 0.05). This study suggests that, if a goal is to induce greater muscle activation during exercise, then push-ups should be performed with hands in a narrow base position compared with a wide base position.""

bodyweightfitness,3dto43,toonboon,0,Sun Jul 19 10:27:43 2015 UTC,"What if there is no table in our house that is sturdy enough to do rows (we actually have a big kitchen table, but the edges are carved so you can't get a safe grab at all), no ""tree"" anywhere close to do pullups, the door frames for some reason can't support a pullup bar (trust me, I tried and fell backside first to the hard wood floor), I'm not allowed to drill anything, and I got no idea how to get a stick that is thick enough to support my weight when placed across two higher items? I read shit like ""I punch people in the face who ask for alternatives"" but I'm completely out of ideas.  Also, below every staircase there is another set of stairs so I don't have a safe stand - and I won't risk breaking my legs.  So far I'm with pushups/dips supported on a chair/situps/bicep+tricep dumbbell exercises, but  reading in the fitness subs here this seems to be utter bullshit and apparently only makes me weaker."
bodyweightfitness,3dto43,LONELY_PLS_PM,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:32:11 2015 UTC,"I refuse to believe that working out in any way will ever make you weaker, that's just circlejerk talk for ""We're not used to doing this so it makes us feel iffy on the inside and this is the way we let you know that we no likey"". Worst case you won't gain noticable physical strength but there is forever the mental gain in areas of discipline and reward.  It's sad you're in such a tough spot. At least you sound like you've tried everything you can think of so the will to get there is present..! So you currently have nowhere to do pull-ups from?  If the kitchen table really is sturdy enough I would look into folding an aluminium (or similar metal) sheet from any DIY store so the end will turn into a sturdy ledge you can hold on to. (like this) Look into adding rubber anti-slip tape/strips/stickers if performing the excercises causes the sheet to slip. Though I reckon with proper form and care the movement should be controlled enough that this should not be an issue. Take care that when using the bulgy rubber antislip thingies to look out for a sort of lever effect which would cause the end of the sheet to lift and subsequently allow the entire sheet to slip off the table slamming into your face.  The other option is to go outside and look further with a more imaginative look. You could take the sheet you made to turn almost anything into an outside pull-up station. In the end one of the beauties of bwf is that you learn to make do with what we've got. I think asking for alternatives is interesting, it teaches you to tackle problems in an innovative way, requires you to look at trees, staircases, street signs with a questioning mind. 'Can I do a pull-up from this?'"

bodyweightfitness,3dqsqm,randomaccount1451435,5,Sat Jul 18 21:28:06 2015 UTC,"This is my back bend:  http://i.imgur.com/KpyghAT.jpg  This was a couple months ago. I got to this point over the course of about a year of training, where I trained bridges 2-3 times a week for 5 sets of a specific, progressive mobility element. As you can see, its not ideal yet, given that the chest should be stacked right over the hands. This is the ideal thoracic mobility:  https://thegymcoach.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/bridge.jpg  I'm now doing the gymnasticbodies bridge stretch course, which focuses primarily on the thoracic spine. I find the elements which target the thoracic spine most directly to be like the one here at 1:10:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2-q4ruoSQU  ...as well as doing the same, but with the chest facing towards the ceiling, and the hands holding on to something behind you (I use my stall bars), with the upper back curling down over the ball. Also, getting in to the bridge position with the feet elevated so that the lower back isn't being the constricting factor, getting the chest stacked over the hands, then doing pushups in that position. Doing walks to and from standing in to bridges is also good, using stall bars, if you're mobile enough. Weighted jefferson curls are good as well. There are a number of other elements that the gb course covers re: bridges, including shoulder mobility, trapezius mobility and lower back mobility, but those are outside of the purview of this conversation.

It isn't unreasonable to think that an adult can attain a bridge though. I, for one, have average genetics, and no particularly great flexibility, but just put in consistent, hard work and attained that (not ideal, but not completely far off) bridge in a year, without doing the stretch course. It's not unreasonable to think that with focused effort, like doing the stretch course, that an adult could get better results in a year or two. I think that overall, people on this sub set goals way too low, both for strength, as well as mobility elements."

As I mentioned, I got that bridge after a year of training. Its not the best, and I didn't have any focused effort towards attaining it (it was the mobility element of one of the gymnasticbodies foundation exercises), so I was only doing like... 5 sets of that element, twice a week. I'm not doing that as well as a 45 minute piece every week, focusing on it. Sommers thinks its the most important general piece of mobility, together with pike mobility, that someone can develop.   Its definitely easier for kids to develop, and they can get to higher overall levels of flexibility. No question about that. Is it more likely that you'd get injured at home, doing progressive mobility elements, compared with a coach? Maybe. I don't really know, but someone could definitely not recognize their limits and overdo it. I think that's more of a cause for concern with skills like cartwheels, handsprings, back flips etc, where developing strength/flexibility is less of the goal, and applying it in terms of the sport more of the goal. Gymnasts have fairly high rates of injury, but I think that's largely due to specific apparatus and skills being done incorrectly, rather than the strength and mobility elements. A study I mentioned to another guy showed that gymnasts don't have a significantly higher level of injury that one would associate with this element, compared w the general population.  I'm personally working on this, with no particular goal in mind other than doing the foundation course, but ideally I'll move on towards doing handsprings and normal classes soon. For most people, being able to do a bridge is... just not necessary for their athletic goals."

Spondylolysis occurs in 6 % of the general population. Of these, approximately 75% will develop spondylolisthesis. According to multiple studies, an increased prevalence of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis exists in groups of athletes practicing certain sports such as gymnastics. In the literature, prevalence of spondylolisthesis in gymnasts can reach up to 40 to 50 %. However, the specific risk factors associated with the development of spondylolisthesis in gymnasts are not known. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis in a population of gymnasts, as well as the associated epidemiological characteristics.   Of the 93 gymnasts evaluated clinically and radiographically, we identified 6 (1 male, 5 females) gymnasts presenting a spondylolysis and/or spondylolisthesis.

Focussed workouts are also necessary to find out what works for you and what doesn't. Not making gains? You can't very well tack on more volume because this already takes forever, and it's hard to change a little thing. Start with the basics, see if you need more/less volume/frequency/etc. and go from there.  That doesn't mean volume isn't a risk.

bodyweightfitness,3drfp0,MudHutMan,4,Sun Jul 19 17:31:41 2015 UTC,"Heck, I'll share it publicly.   Grip strength: Wad up a towel in your lap. Grab a big handful of it, briefly squeeze as hard as you can, then release it and do it with the other hand. Repeat until hands are very tired. I have found this more effective than anything else. Other forearm work: Lay your forearm on your thigh (or a chair or something) so that your hand dangles off of it palm down. Perform the action of a reverse wrist curl, but push down on your hand with your other hand to provide resistance. This works extensor muscles. You can also work on reverse curl motions for brachioradialis using self resistance (reverse curl one hand and push down with the other) or by working it isometrically on immovable external objects like hand rails. Isolations: I like inverted shrugs for traps, ideally on rings but sometimes on bars if needed. For chest you can isometrically work a fly motion on various obstacles you find, I prefer anything with many vertical bars close together such as window bars, since I can then work through the whole range of motion. For middle delt I just isometrically mimic a lateral raise on various obstacles, but you can also do a self resistance exercise for this: bend your left arm and do a ""chicken dance"" type move, but find a way to reach across with your other arm and pull downwards so that you provide resistance for your middle delt.  Bicep work: my favorite is the ""bodyweight biceps curl,"" which amounts to getting underneath a bar you would do inverted rows on, grabbing the bar in an underhanded false grip, and using your biceps to pull the bar to your forehead. Very difficult. Neck training: there's lots out there, best go on youtube and look up grappler neck drills. For me that's mostly head bridges. Balance drills: walking narrow objects, walking along hand rails, etc. Parkourists do this. Conditioning: bodyweight exercise circuit. 10 push ups, 10 inverted rows, 10 lunges, all done quick and explosively. Do 5-10 rounds with minimal rest. Sometimes I'll do leg raises or V-ups after the lunges, sometimes I'll add grip work into the circuit too, but this is the basic rotation for me.   Hope this is useful to somebody."

While I'm standing there I hold a 20 kg dumbbell in one hand with my shoulder up and my elbow bent. Do that for a few minutes the switch arms.   Also stand on one leg with your knee bent like the first third of a pistol squat but I'm usually on my toes. I don't know if either of these are good or bad but I know the dumbbell will help grip strength and core. And I feel like I've done something."

The total amount dedicated to the structure and routine is 6 pages long, but there is a lot of good information in those six pages that can be applied outside of the 12 week program.   As for the routine, it depends how fit you are going into it. While it is marketed for any experience level, I had a hard time keeping up with the volume. I ended up just doing the beginner routine and feel that after a few months of working out, I'll move to this routine."

bodyweightfitness,3dnd12,hipsterinplaid,4,Sat Jul 18 06:08:56 2015 UTC,Even the flute. My flute teacher in college had me doing all sorts of crazy core exercises lying down on the floors of practice rooms.

bodyweightfitness,3dnd12,hipsterinplaid,4,Sat Jul 18 09:39:00 2015 UTC,"Sure, what I remember. It's been a while and this particular teacher was pretty old world/old school---hopefully nothing here has been found to hinder rather than help. (First be sure you're breathing correctly: when you inhale the air goes straight down and your stomach and sides expand forward and out, rather than breathing with the chest so that the shoulders go up.) She had me first practicing proper breathing (pushing myself to expand as far as possible and then breath out as far as possible... she used to remind me to ""squeeze oranges with my stomach muscles"") on the floor with my legs bent so the lower back touched the floor like in a hollow hold. After a while she started adding books as weights on my abdomen. Then it was practicing this breathing with my legs up at 90 degrees to the floor, and then later at 45 degrees. There were some others including an exercise with your feet on the wall like in the paper OP linked, but I don't remember exactly what they was.   To be honest, I think just being really cognizant of correct breathing and posture goes a long way. And practice standing!  (Edit for confusing typo.)"

bodyweightfitness,3dnd12,hipsterinplaid,2,Sat Jul 18 21:33:30 2015 UTC,"Well, I've only been playing flute for two years and I still play clarinet and sax besides so it's hard to tell. My guess is not as much since there isn't the resistance of a reed or brass mouthpiece, but correct breathing and posture still helps."
bodyweightfitness,3dnd12,smbtuckma,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:14:29 2015 UTC,This gives me more reasons to learn a new instrument haha
bodyweightfitness,3dnd12,hipsterinplaid,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:42:05 2015 UTC,"Interesting about the resistance. I was told that flute required the most breath control of the wind instruments for exactly that reason, the lack of a reed to push against. Do you find it much different? I only played double-reeds as my secondaries, but with those (very resistant) reeds I found it easier to control my air because there was so much to push against... that flute took more breath control work because without it the air would all come out in a big torrent and be gone. I guess I'm saying the same thing as you, but had been coming to the opposite conclusion based on it.   Regardless, go wind instruments! The doctor who treats my asthma says they have higher standards for peak flow tests for wind players and singers versus non musicians. So it's definitely working something!"
bodyweightfitness,3dnd12,tastditms,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:03:59 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah for sure it requires more breath control, but I find that's different than needing core muscle to power the breath enough to blow past a reed/speed it enough for good clarinet tone. Like, if I put that much force behind the air on a flute I'd break all the windows with how high the note would come out haha.  But I'm also not great at flute still so don't consider me an expert."

I started putting in the work to get it up to par and get a consistent tone and breathe. After a few months, I was noticing a bit of improvement but still felt like breathing was difficult. Then I looked at one of my friends who has been singing forever and who is incredibly fit. I asked him what he does and he told me that he actually practices his vocal exercises while he's working out.  That's when it dawned on me that my core is so weak that I would probably need to work out to help me with my breathing. The vocal exercises alone weren't improving things quick enough and I would need to incorporate some core exercises into my vocal routine. I don't sing anymore, but since I've started bodyweight fitness and I can feel my core strengthening, it makes me want to get back into just to test that difference."

To me it's great to see that the same concepts of something can be applied to multiple facets of life, be it for purely physical purposes or not. If the concept of the diaphragm can be translated through an exercise where you blow a balloon, a fundamental technique of generating proper vocal sound, or tip-of-the-tongue-roof-of-the-mouth qigong exercises for forms/drills, the beauty lies within the fact that it's a part of all three seemingly different things.  Also I don't like to make statements on things that I don't have a fundamental understanding of right out of the gate. I understand qigong at an operational level, but I couldn't explain it to someone who's never heard of it before. Singing? I do that a lot.  And when I said ""not all martial art systems"" I mean there's more out there than traditional Chinese kungfu/boxing systems. Additionally, qigong is somewhat of a lost art and a lot of people who don't understand it think it's bullshit."

bodyweightfitness,3dnd12,Joshua_Naterman,12,Sat Jul 18 14:58:43 2015 UTC,"Any resisted breathing exercise that focuses on ""breathing into the stomach first, and exhaling from the stomach first"" is going to work. Bonus for putting a small book on the stomach, since simple tactile and visual cues work the best. Once you learn the pattern you can just breathe rapidly through clenched teeth. You could also buy a Power Lung, which I used back in my early 20's with great success. It lets you individually adjust inhalation and exhalation resistance, which is pretty nifty.  If you can't engage your diaphragm you can't compress your abdominal viscera to stabilize the spine, and that makes you ""weaker"" than you really are."

bodyweightfitness,3dnd12,eewallace,6,Sun Jul 19 12:42:01 2015 UTC,"Seems like they're starting from the assumption that poor posture and muscle imbalances are major sources of low back pain, and coming up with a story about how the usual postural bogeymen might interfere with respiration. From a quick look through the citations, I don't see anything that looks like solid evidence for a link between poor respiration and back pain, and no data showing efficacy of this exercise for any particular condition.  Respiratory efficiency is obviously going to affect a lot of things to varying degrees. But it's not at all clear to me that a reduced zone of apposition is a common or significant source of reduced performance or increased pain in otherwise healthy people. And if it is, it's not clear that the proposed exercise is likely to be any better at improving breathing mechanics than standard core work, aerobic exercise with focus on breathing, and/or typical breathing exercises."
bodyweightfitness,3dnd12,Joshua_Naterman,7,Sat Jul 18 15:26:44 2015 UTC,"With respect, lower back pain is often associated with postural and ""movement imbalance"" issues, particularly hypertonic hip flexors and anterior pelvic tilt.  There's very little correlation with actual degeneration of the discs, as literature reviews will tell you... which was a bit of a surprise.  The diaphragm connection... is a little sketchy lol :) But it does matter during high intensity exercise like strength training. More than people think.  It's commonly understood that this is a big deal for exercises like squat and deadlift variations, but it's also a big deal for heavy duty upper body strength as well. Makes a huge difference in FL prep elements such as body levers, as well as bench press, weigthed push ups, dips and pull ups, biceps curls, it's actually pretty surprising.  It's obviously not the diaphragm directly, but rather the less than optimal stiffness that comes from not properly compressing the abdominal viscera.  You won't find a study for every reference, and if those are your only bench mark you will be somewhat handicapped in your understanding of the body.  it's also important to look at our bodies as machines that are created with specific configurations, tolerances, and control/feedback systems and loops.  That perspective helps fill in the gaps where research fails, and it often fails simply because this perspective was not used to generate informed, intelligent research questions.  A prime example is shoulder pain and impingement, which I won't go on about here, but the TLDR is that people have tested different rotator cuff exercises for years while actively ignoring scapular and thoracic spine positioning. Seriously. It's nuts. Somehow 10+ years of consistent comments in published research regarding thoracic spine just got ignored until late 2013, and there's still no really fundamental investigations into the underlying architectural problems regarding scapular tilt and rotation both as primariy issues and secondary to spinal posture.  Why that is, I don't know. I really don't. It's beyond boggling."

Folks devote their lives to that goal and it's actually fairly difficult to do even intentionally.  If you don't eat like a big person, you won't be a big person.  The cool thing is that you can get a lot stronger before you really gain much weight.  If you can't drill holes, then a power tower is a decent option as a stand alone system.  You can add a pair of rings to add some movements to your schedule and add a loop of webbing and some weights if you want to progress with basic movements like the dip or pullup.  It looks like people have put as much as 270lbs on it for pull ups so that would get you decently far for weight work if you wanted to go that direction."
bodyweightfitness,3dn2y6,AT_thruhiker,7,Fri Jul 17 18:35:52 2015 UTC,I got this tower last week and it has been amazing. It is great for pull-ups and dips. I would suggest getting some wooden rings to hang off it for rows though. You can then also move onto ring dips later on in your progression.
bodyweightfitness,3dn2y6,billyjenkins,6,Fri Jul 17 16:56:29 2015 UTC,You can do some rows by hanging from the dip bars too. It is definitely sufficient for the beginner routine.
bodyweightfitness,3dn2y6,ArcaneNine,3,Fri Jul 17 17:15:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm just not strong enough yet to do rows at the angle of the dip bars. Rings give me more variability in the angle so for me it's better for progressions."

bodyweightfitness,3dn2y6,Relentless-,5,Fri Jul 17 17:11:17 2015 UTC,One thing to consider is if you plan to do dips with the tower. The Golds Gym tower I bought had the dip bars spaced too far apart for my body size so when I performed the dip I was compressing my rib cage. It did bad things so I basically couldn't use the tower for half the reason I bought it.
bodyweightfitness,3dn2y6,pinkwaffles,3,Fri Jul 17 18:52:49 2015 UTC,I bought the ProGear 275 Tower Fitness Station which is a slighty beefier version for 60$ more. I liked that i could plant it against the wall since all the handles face one direction so it saves a bit of room. keep in mind that both machines are tall so you need high ceilings just to do pullups on it. i think my basement is 8 foot to the joyces and my head gets really close. just an FYI.

The videos I've seen all indicate that your heel should maintain contact with the floor. I'm not sure why this is stated though.

It will not do much for your regular squat, and may aggravate patellar pain syndromes, but you may like how it feels and you may be a fan of Cossack Dancing which does an awful lot of low movement in this position.  It's possible that what you're describing could help you slowly improve ankle dorsiflexion, but I'd be careful to maintain weight on the outside half of the bottom of the foot and actively prevent pronation. Otherwise you'll very likely be stretching the arch of the foot instead of the ankle, and decreasing your foot's inherent stability."

bodyweightfitness,3dmwjp,MrArnie2,4,Fri Jul 17 15:52:10 2015 UTC,"One arm varieties often require considerably more work to be done by scapular stabilizers, because you have to use them to balance both the body on the scapula AND the scapula on the body, as opposed to two arm movements where the force is the same on both sides of the body and therefore the body is much more balanced on the scapula.  This can be good or bad, depending on how well you are able to control your body. These tend to be more difficult to do safely or correctly with bodyweight only, but fairly easy to do with a cable row, which is my preference.  The reasons for that preference are:  1) I can now pull more than my bodyweight with one arm for 8 reps. I'd literally never be able to build that strength with just my body.  2) The body freely rotates through space when you're hanging off of something, and that makes it virtually impossible to perform correctly or safely at greater angles of lean, no matter how wide you make your stance.  By contrast, largely because of the fact that my feet are perpendicular to the axis of rotation instead of in line with it when I am on the cable row, I am actually able to brace myself properly with my feet and prevent the offline rotation.  Currently hitting 230 lbs for 8 reps, 4 sets of that, and then 2-3 sets of 5 negatives with 270. Fl has become so easy it's kind of silly, it's very annoying that my elbow won't tolerate it for a while. I did it once just to see, and it was quite painful but very easy.  For those who don't know, my elbow injury is not training related. Someone threw their car door open in a parking lot and crushed part of my triceps tendon insertion at the elbow. It'll be 18-24 months before it's truly healed properly."

You should know how to perform your exercises and if not look up the known tutorials in this sub or on youtube. I guarantee you that they will be better explained/executed then the ones in the App. And you should train when you are capable of it and not when an App tells you to. Ok, if you have motivational problems to start your training this point maybe helpful... but yeah.. better to think about why you have these problems and work them out then let some software tell you to do your stuff :-)  Furthermore you should always try to diverse your exercises, not only to make the training fun, but to get some different stress on your muscles."

bodyweightfitness,3dpw5x,JavierGerardo,3,Sat Jul 18 08:03:43 2015 UTC,"If your weight isn't changing, it's definitely your nutrition. No amount of exercise can magically increase your mass. Find cheap protein sources, like peanuts, beans, rice. Maybe /r/EatCheapAndHealthy/ has some suggestions.  The lack of horizontal pulls is definitely a problem in your routine though.  Bridges are hard to do right for beginners since they put most of the bend in the lower back, even though it's supposed to be evenly distributed through the whole spine. And angled bridges (I'm assuming it's those hand elevated ones) just enforce this entirely wrong pattern. Foot elevated bridges are a much better first step towards bridges, because you can easily remove any bend whatsoever from your lower spine if you focus on it. For now I'd mostly focus not on specific bridging work but on opening up the shoulders, hips and thoracic spine if you want a good full bridge later on. It's a mobility element, not really meant to be strength work."
bodyweightfitness,3dpw5x,mmmr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:27:42 2015 UTC,Thanks. I will get my nutrition set.  Do you think that horizontal pulls are more important than dips? I plan to add dips as part of my Day 2 routine. Maybe add the horizontal pulls on the Day 1.  I've been doing bridges for more than a year now and I started with short bridges. Do you think I'm doing too much sets? Maybe just limit the sets to 8 and do the movement much slower?
bodyweightfitness,3dpw5x,randomaccount1451435,2,Mon Jul 20 09:49:35 2015 UTC,"So I just looked and saw this as being the progression you're referring to:  http://convict-conditioning.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bridges.jpg  I'm not really sure what the point of adding this in to their routine is, as a strength element. Bridges are really more of a mobility thing. My issue with this progression is that firstly, you don't need to do 30 reps, because its grossly excessive. But maybe more pertinently, noone is going to be able to get in to and out of that last progression in a controlled manner by following this routine. Compare with this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8IeEF2jDa4  Shes got good thoracic mobility. You can see that her upper chest is pretty much right over her hands there when in the bridge position. A bridge is usually the building block off of which a back handspring, back limber or other moves are based off of. Getting to that point incorporates getting shoulder mobility, thoracic and lumbar spine mobility, hip flexor mobility and the strength and coordination to execute the move while balancing over a center of gravity that doesn't seem to be possible in the CC picture. It really looks like that figure is just falling in to this substandard bridge. The CC progression seems to be just completely strength focused, with next to no actual flexibility element, keeping the back more or less completely straight in the progressions, and SOMEHOW just controlling a descent in to a substandard bridge with your feet presumably bolted to the floor, because the center of gravity in those pictures would otherwise just make it impossible to control the descent in to (not to even begin to address the more difficult ascent out of). You just cant do a bridge without adequate thoracic mobility, not to mention mobility in the other areas. I'd focus on achieving that, first and foremost.  So I'm gonna agree with /u/mmmr about not focusing on upping the reps on this for strength. Focus on something else for strength, and find a program to better your thoracic mobility. I went over a couple of the things I have done here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/3dqsqm/thoracic_spine_mobility_exercises/ct7w2nz  CC is very meh imo. They have poor progressions, including one for a one arm handstand pushup. No one has done one, to the best of my knowledge. Take that stuff with a grain of salt."
bodyweightfitness,3dpw5x,mmmr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:07:00 2015 UTC,"Without horizontal pulling you don't have much hitting the upper middle back at all. Also rear delts. Rear delts mostly activate for pulling movements once the elbows travel behind the body. That only really happens in exercises such as rows and Manna.  Usually you only choose 2 pushing and 2 pulling movements, so dips would be a bit out of place. You can get away with dips, pushups and pike pushups in the same routine if you did something like pullups, rows and front lever progressions. Maybe. But that adds a shit ton of complexity and your CNS is gonna be very slow in adapting to all those different moves.  Bridging is more about getting the form right, you're not going to get much strength out of it regardless how you change the movement. In general slowing down a movement just means you're allowing yourself to use less strength than you could produce. Not the desired effect you're hoping for, I guess. I wouldn't even shoot for reps at all. Just holds and form check to find out what's wrong with it and try to fix that. It really is about flexibility and gaining control over how your spine, hips and shoulders move. I'm guessing you want them as part of your routine because convict conditioning talks about how great they are, right? Convict conditioning has a weird setup there, I don't know why they think it's proper strength work. Are these pictures taken from the book? because if so, those are terrible bridges and just go to show that the approach doesn't work. This is a better example of a full bridge by /u/randomaccount1451435. Maybe he has some tips for you."

The ones I bought are wood and rated for 400lb+.  The straps should support a thousand pounds or more, I would think.  I can't see from your picture how your rings are mounted, so maybe that's the weak link? But even then, eye-bolts, u-bolts, and many carabiners should support 250-300 pounds no problem. I don't know how much you weigh or how much you're planning on dipping, but I don't think you'll be beyond that any time soon."

Bought rings a few weeks later.   It was rainy a few days later and I wanted to workout and not be in the rain. So I figured out a way to hang the rings in my garage.  I just painted the posts and bar last night for preservation purposes (I'm not sure the wood was treated), so maybe I'll snap another picture when I get home.  It serves me well.  EDIT: Post paint job."
bodyweightfitness,3dlp0j,pingus3233,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:09:45 2015 UTC,...I constructed a pull up bar outside.   I'm thinking about doing the same. How deep did you sink the 4x4s and what's their height above ground?
bodyweightfitness,3dlp0j,elzeardclym,3,Fri Jul 17 22:56:36 2015 UTC,"I used 4x4x10s and sunk them about a foot and a half deep. The post hole digger I used was kind of crappy so I couldn't have really went deeper if I wanted.   The goal was to have it high enough that I couldn't touch the ground. I'm 6' tall and it is just high enough that I have to jump to reach it. I keep a piece of scrap 6x6 that I had around to stand on so I can reach it with the tips of my fingers. Ideally I would have went another six inches.   Depending on your height and how much you want to reach, you could go deeper. Or get 8' boards or something. It's definitely deep enough and the posts aren't going anywhere though. I did use concrete mix, but I think they'd be fine even if just backfilled with dirt."

If you're considering putting one up I think it's worth it for that alone. You are looking at about a $50 initial investment, give or take some (and assuming you have some tools at your disposal) -- but in my opinion it's already paid for. Plus, being another place to hang rings only increases its value."

bodyweightfitness,3dlp0j,uknownalias,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:44:33 2015 UTC,is the iron gym just a regular door frame pull up bar?  also do you hang rings from the door frame pull up bars?
bodyweightfitness,3dlp0j,itakmaszraka,2,Fri Jul 17 16:14:57 2015 UTC,The iron gym goes over the top of the door frame and uses a metal insert and pressure on the other side of the door to keep it sturdy.    This other type pushes against the sides of the doorframe and relies on the user to have made sure it's tight enough for your weight.  Thus I feel for a variety of reasons it's more likely to come loose.   Rings can easily be hung on the iron gym by slipping them over the cushions  where the bar contacts the door frame.   You might want to refer to a picture to understand what I'm going on about
bodyweightfitness,3dlp0j,uknownalias,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:34:53 2015 UTC,"Well you need to tighten it and try out before working out, there are always these rubber thingies to screw to your frame, so your bar has no chance of slipping. Bar works for me, because I'm too weak to do pull ups yet, I do rows on it with my legs on the chair. I wouldn't be able to install bar so low if it was iron gym."
bodyweightfitness,3dlp0j,utopianfiat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:16:28 2015 UTC,True. However iron gym can be used with rings which makes for a nice rowing experience
bodyweightfitness,3dlp0j,itakmaszraka,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:44:00 2015 UTC,I did that bar at a magnificently spherical 245lbs. Let's just say Iron Gym paid off a lot more.

bodyweightfitness,3dlp0j,theshankins,3,Fri Jul 17 11:53:57 2015 UTC,I'm just going to comment on the climbing stuff. Are you a climber? If you are it's totally worth it but also pretty expensive. Those holds are super pricy. They sell small overhang where you can practice your crimps and slopers and pinches and stuff. But you'll only be able to make to fit a couple movements onto a small wall but that's totally worth it if you're a legit climber and know what you're doing but will probably be really boring if that doesn't describe you. Or you can also just get a hang board climber or not
bodyweightfitness,3dlp0j,Mattcowie,2,Fri Jul 17 14:10:33 2015 UTC,Not a climber so I'll scratch that off the list.  Thanks for the feedback.
bodyweightfitness,3dlp0j,madplayshd,2,Fri Jul 17 16:54:01 2015 UTC,"Climber checking in. Depends on your space and what you are wanting to gain by climbing. Steeper angle equals better workout and longer climbs but at the cost of a significant more amount of space. Holds can be cheap, look on your local craigslist or make your own from bondo (yes this actually works I did it on my old wall)."

Pull ups https://youtu.be/wvyLnon8NRA Video was taken ~5 weeks ago, but the only changes are that I can pull myself up more smoothly now and without swinging my legs. I want to make sure that my form is correct otherwise."
bodyweightfitness,3dm2io,brandnew87,2,Fri Jul 17 14:23:38 2015 UTC,"Check out starting stretching and use it as a cooldown. It has some great stretches that work up to german hang in particular. German hangs are considered an advanced stretch, so it might be best to do some of the beginner/intermediate stretches before you try to hang there. I suspect that you're just tight in that area and it will take time to build up the mobility. On coming back up, it will probably just come with time as you work through other core-focused exercises (L-sit, bodyline, etc).   This is a great reference for skin the cat too:  https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/315n76/technique_thursday_skin_the_cat_tutorial/  For the pull-up, avoid using the neutral grip and focus on true pull-ups or chin-ups (I prefer pull-ups, which is palms-forward). Definitely work to avoid kipping, even if it means going back to negatives. I had to reset once I was pretty far into pull-ups because I was kipping and it was making my form garbage, and it's better to lock it in early.   You're in the same predicament I'm in as well, where I'm too tall for the doorway bar. I recommend keeping the legs in a hollow-body form, so at the bottom, your feet are about touching the ground and they can start on the ground as you begin your pull (though don't push with them, obviously). Don't tuck the knees under, as it can force an arch to the back as you begin unconsciously kipping up. This adds a bit more core work, but it's not a true L-sit pull-up because you're free to let them move down a bit during the pull-up. This will help you in future progressions anyways. It also looks like you're doing this, but make sure the arms are completely straight at the bottom before the next rep.   I hope that helps!"

This should be easy (if it's not you have more serious mobility issues). The exercise is to maintain your leg and arm position as you posteriorly tuck your pelvis and flatten your lower back. Your arms and legs should remain on the floor, and this should feel easy.  If your hip flexors are not releasing, then you won't be able to do this easily or at all. If this is the case, bend up your knees a little and try again. If this works it's probably your hip flexors."

Imagine you took a stick, balanced it upright on its point and let go. Wow! 2 second handstand! My point here is that you haven't learnt to balance.  Golden rule for developing skills: you should be doing drills that you can do mostly successfully. How many times did you successfully rebalance in your attempt? 0? Time for a different drill.  Balance drills:   toe/heel pulls (use you fingers and wrist to pull your stiff body off the wall) wall scissors (if you can't do it slowly, you weren't balanced) wall handstands, but balancing off the wall as long as possible"

I'm switching from startbodyweight and doing the recommended routine, so some areas may be tighter than others. Here's a clip of my form once I'm at the top. I'm working hard on posterior tilt and keeping the glutes, thighs and core tight. I'm specifically concerned about arching in the back. Any suggestions?   https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzA_zWoGs8CORWRhMlZXdU51MjQ/view  Second one is backbend.

bodyweightfitness,3dm2io,orealy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:29:07 2015 UTC,"Good point on the backbend, I'll make sure I'm more locked out at the arms so that everything opens up better. I just realized the other day that pushing my legs straighter pushes me over my hands more effectively, so I'm still adjusting slightly to the new form. Since I just started the recommended routine, I'm feeling that the warm-ups and starting stretching that I'm doing as a cool down will help tremendously with shoulder opening and allow me to get deeper into the pose.  On the handstand, I'm still building up endurance before I work on freestanding, but thanks for the form check!"

The weight of my knees seems to hurt less on the back of my arms the as I do this more often as long as I try to lift my knees away. I can't really tell if my arms are straight. If the goal is to get my knees higher, am I supposed to end with them in my armpits?"

I don't know how much people will be able to help from this video, since the angle's not great and my legs are out of the frame. I haven't been able to find a better angle to shoot from, but I can try to figure something out if it would be more helpful. Just realized the baggy shirt makes it hard to see what's going on with my back - that I should be able to improve in a future clip.  All that said, what I'm mainly looking for opinions on is whether the shoulder/arm motion looks basically right. Does it at least look good enough to be worth continuing to do them at this bar height? It's hard to see from the angle, but my chest touches the bar on the first 4 or 5 reps, and is an inch or two shy on the last 1 or 2. I've had a fair bit of trouble with scapular control in general, especially on the right. That's getting better, but progress has seemed quite slow, rep-wise. Unfortunately, I don't currently have access to a bar higher than this one but shorter than me.  It looks to me like I'm bending a little at the waist and pushing my head forward a bit. Not sure if either of those is a problem."
bodyweightfitness,3dnsuu,mikegymnastics,2,Fri Jul 17 19:53:32 2015 UTC,"For static holds 2 seconds count as 'one rep'. Ideally you'll want to be working in the 3-8 rep range, which is 6-16 seconds for each isometric set. If you can hold a tuck planche for 16 seconds for 3 sets, try adding a set or a couple extra seconds of hold time until you can do advanced tuck planche 6 secs x 3 sets."

Working with a harder progression, even for a shorter time, obviously provides a higher training stimulus. It would be like benching 135 for sets of 15 reps instead of 185 for sets of 3, when the goal is strength development. I got to a 2x30 second tucked L Sit two days ago, tried the extended today, and got 5x12s. Would you recommend I get 4x15s or 3x16 then just start training 6 second holds of the full L Sit?"

It really depends on your goals and how fast you're trying to progress.

bodyweightfitness,3dntbf,elzeardclym,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:27:25 2015 UTC,"Well, for pullups the norm is usually chin over the bar for it to count.

You can still do various pulling exercises and adding weight is always an option."

Also try to do the step ups very very controlled and slow on way down. Fast on up but a controlled fast.  I also started adding in a exercise where I put knees on floor facing away from my bed frame then my heels lock under the bed frame (I use something for padding the heels/calves cause they will be taking on a lot of force). I then lower my body as controlled as possible using hamstrings. I end up falling forward cause I'm not strong enough yet. But half of the fall is controlled.   I also need to add Hill sprints one or two days a week to build legs a bit too while getting in some cardiovascular type work."

If I hold my leg with my hands or rest it on something, I can have it straight out, parallel to the ground. But I can't lift it up using leg muscles only.

bodyweightfitness,3dkws3,shul0k,2,Fri Jul 17 07:06:29 2015 UTC,"That is a good way to get better at the movement, but a good pistol strives to keep the leg straight out.

bodyweightfitness,3dkws3,AestheticsAtWorrk,2,Sat Jul 18 10:01:19 2015 UTC,Lots of good advice here.  What also helped me was just holding the starting pistol position for 30 seconds or so each leg.  This will help with the flexibility as well as the balance required for pistols.  So just stand up straight on one leg while holding the other leg outstretched in front of you.  Also assisted pistols with a chair or something is a big help...I'm assuming you've done lots of these or else you wouldn't be ready for a full pistol.
bodyweightfitness,3dkws3,ylevitan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:05:56 2015 UTC,It might be a little easier to get straight if you hold the foot of the extended leg.

bodyweightfitness,3dkws3,ArcaneNine,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:56:23 2015 UTC,"It might just be a leverage issue too. If you extend your leg all the way it might pull you forward too much, so you keep it bent for balance. You can check by trying a pistol that goes 70% of the way down and seeing if you can keep your leg straight.  I don't think it's a major issue. Try to stretch out and fix it, but I think it fixes itself as you get stronger."

bodyweightfitness,3dl6eh,mbdxjst2,3,Fri Jul 17 04:04:39 2015 UTC,"most pull exercises work your back muscles, and push exercises your front side. for example, if you do nothing but push up/bench, and ignore rows, you're only working your front and lateral deltoids, ignoring the rear deltoid and the scapular muscles completely, meaning the front of the shoulder would be very strong and the retracting muscles weak, making them likely unstable and constantly a little rolled forward.  i'm not exactly certain on how ignoring other agonist/antagonist pairs effects the body though, like biceps and triceps, but i'm sure there's something to be said about balance there as well.  e: push and pull exercises work different muscles, but a lot of pulling exercises use the muscles you'd use in the ""opposite"" pushing exercises as stabilisers and vice versa. it's pretty cool."

In addition to this: Muscles themselves are not able to ""push"", muscles can only contract. That said, the ""pushing"" exercises use muscles that contract (pull) but through geometry and how the muscles are attached to the skeleton, an overall ""push"" movement results.

Simply: stronger muscles will overpower the weaker muscles, and it will cause a repetitive cycle. For certain movements which require both sets of muscles, you'll see either stronger muscles compensating, causing a bottleneck.

bodyweightfitness,3dhklt,Y6Y1Y9,17,Thu Jul 16 16:38:05 2015 UTC,"Usually, after you have acquired a basic level of strength and a reliable exercise habit, you choose a goal and then find some progression towards that goal. After a while, unless you are lucky, you will probably get stuck at one of the steps and you will look for another progression idea to cover that gap etc. In this progress you will collect a lot of ideas on how to train, but they are all means to your goal so there is no need to really keep a perfect track of everything.  That said, in my experience Dan's progressions are some of the most well-thought, most functional progressions around. They have helped me to reach goals I had lost all hope for (like pistol and pullups) so I would suggest to start from one of these and see where it takes you, rather than thinking about accumulating a lot of different exercises for the same thing."
bodyweightfitness,3dhklt,snailking1,2,Thu Jul 16 17:28:01 2015 UTC,"How exactly do ""goals"" work. How is there more than one? Isn't there just ""to lose fat and become stronger?"" I'm not sure i understand how there are multiple goals to that, especially in the context of just within Body Weight Fitness."
bodyweightfitness,3dhklt,Y6Y1Y9,8,Thu Jul 16 23:19:24 2015 UTC,"Except for my first 6 months (where my only goal was to acquire the habit of exercising and I optimized everything for it - my reasoning being that once I had done that I was set for life, so what difference would 6 months make?) I found that the best kind of goal is a movement that I would like to be able to do, like the handstand pushup, the pistol squat, the l-sit etc.   There is still an overall goal of getting stronger, of course, but having a cool movement to work towards is great for focus and motivation.   You probably know from the faq that you should balance pushing and pulling, horizontal and vertical etc., but how do you know what kind of exercise to do as ""horizontal pushing"" for example? Simple: you choose one movement you like, for example the one arm pushup, and then you find a progression to reach that movement. This also prevents the feeling of being overloaded with too much exercises and workouts, while keeping you focused. I believe most people who use body weight strength exercises do something like this."
bodyweightfitness,3dhklt,snailking1,3,Thu Jul 16 23:40:12 2015 UTC,"I think as far as choosing a goal he means choosing a specific move that you want to accomplish. Like, wanting to be able to do a human flag, or planche, or handstand pushup, etc."
bodyweightfitness,3dhklt,net_enginerd,2,Thu Jul 16 23:44:17 2015 UTC,"My goal is to do a muscle up into a planche pushup. so it isn't about losing fat (i'm 5'9"", 145lbs) and becoming generally stronger. I want to be able to do a certain task."

bodyweightfitness,3djs4o,_moiz_,7,Thu Jul 16 21:00:04 2015 UTC,"I think the variety of blocks for step ups (or things like box jumps) is a good idea.  I don't know what you mean by a leg press machine, but it sounds pretty useless if it intends to just use your bodyweight. Squatting would be better.   The leg press gives you a massive mechanical advantage compared to squatting because of the angle... For reference, see this video of a 10 x 1000kg leg press with good range of motion. By comparison the squat record 1 RM is 490kg.  Is there a possibility for you to put in rings, or at least a high bar for people to have a nice platform to hang their own rings off of?"
bodyweightfitness,3djs4o,AnonymousWritings,5,Fri Jul 17 01:30:41 2015 UTC,"+1 for rings. It can be a trouble for people to find and set up rings in their own homes, so having a way to use rings at the same place you use bars would be awesome."
bodyweightfitness,3djs4o,Tynk3r,4,Fri Jul 17 06:41:52 2015 UTC,Glute ham raises are the only bodyweight leg exercise equipment of any value on my opinion.  I would go for one of those and the rest using various isolation and leverage tricks or just going for a barbell.  Step ups are ok but considering how easy it is to find flat surfaces you can stand on I don't think it's worth building.  It takes the around the same effort to build a squat rack

bodyweightfitness,3dluns,Potentia,3,Fri Jul 17 09:32:00 2015 UTC,"Congrats on losing weight so far!  That's always an awesome accomplishment considering how difficult it can be.  Here is my two cents...  Working out can be helpful for your body in ways other than just aesthetics. (Stress relief has been mentioned by others.  I also think it improves the blood flow over time, so that your brain, and consequently your studying, may actually benefit from body movement.  Plus, I've noticed I feel more alert after exercising.) So, I think it may benefit you to continue some form of exercise in September.  However, from what you have mentioned, you don't seem to have a consistent diet/workout routine, and you don't seem to have a healthy view of working out and eating properly. You have the rest of July and August to decide on a workout routine that will work with your schedule and an appropriate eating plan that will work with your goals.  During this time before September, I would really focus on learning discipline in those areas and learning how to have a healthier mindset toward exercising (discipline your brain to view losing weight differently!).  Losing weight is not a race; it is incorporating lifestyle changes that won't burn you out a year from now, but rather are easy to maintain once you discipline yourself. And please, please stop measuring multiple times a day.  It isn't healthy!  Tl;dr - use the next 1.5 months to set up a consistent but healthy workout routine and diet plan and also to develop healthier thought patterns toward working out"
bodyweightfitness,3dluns,dorfcally,2,Fri Jul 17 12:37:43 2015 UTC,You can't possibly be doing nothing but exam studying all day every day. Work out whenever you feel like it or to take your mind off exams. Gotta keep your body up physically or else it will drag you down mentally.

bodyweightfitness,3dluns,riodeshake,2,Fri Jul 17 10:15:14 2015 UTC,"i understand your issue. I was diagnosed with OCD and sometimes i obsess too much about the topic at hand, that it is disruptive to everything else in my life.  first, take a few deep breaths. be proud you are willing to put in the effort to change your lifestyle, that takes self realization. you've already become more mature than your friends, who can't get past their own issues so they have to pick on yours.   working out is not going anywhere, it is not a race, it's slow and steady. see it that way. don't work out for anyone else, work out for your own sake. work out because you want to get healthier. don't work out because you want people to stop making fun of you, because they will find something else to make fun of.   if you feel you will get too obsessive, then sure, stop and study. your career and education is more important, and bodyweight training isn't going to disappear just because you stopped doing it.  recognize, all of this is your decision. however, i will offer my advice, I think you should continue to do some body-weight training. don't over do it, but just do a few pull ups and rows on one day and push ups and dips on another day, or set up a routine you can stick to that doesn't take up hours of your time.  why? - consistency will give you result. working out will teach you discipline and help you with your studies. working out will release feel good endorphin's that will boost your self esteem. you will feel more energy and will be more confident in your abilities, all of which will reflect well on your studies.  keep at it, and you will get to where you want to be"
bodyweightfitness,3dluns,Balboa_,2,Fri Jul 17 10:57:00 2015 UTC,I agree with your advice. Past few weeks as I an restricted to working out at home been searching for a pull up bar. Thought about every place. But after hearing your advice I think I will stick to all other exercises except rows and pull ups. Will do only occasional pull up on a edge of wall can't do more than one or two because my callus hurts and do pull ups on bar one or two times whenever I get a chance to in outside home.  Some people will say that this might cause imbalance and shoulder injury but I think I will start pulling movements from January and undo all the damage and imbalance.

I was part of the second category, when in college, and I couldn't both properly focus on studying and workout at the same time and, like yourself, I used the gym to study less than I should have. My suggestion is to be a healthy student. Get up early, have a light breakfast and study all day while taking frequent (but short and timed) breaks, plus lunch and dinner at acceptable time. Once you got that nailed down, see if some sort of workout will not disrupt your study schedule. It was not an easy balance for me and all of the sudden what was supposed to be just an hour workout caused a full wasted day without studying. I definitely remember your pain. Good luck!"

Some cues when you're in it: Big toes together. Heels to butt.  And engage knees toward each other so they don't slide out to the sides. Things to avoid: It's hard to do this if your clothes slide or if your arms are sweaty (that's a big problem doing this in a yoga class). Fun variation to learn: Crow pose transition to tripod headstand and back to crow."

bodyweightfitness,3dhyen,benjimann91,2,Thu Jul 16 17:53:56 2015 UTC,I've found that it's a ton easier when you feel humid/sticky. Your arms stick to your elbows a little.
bodyweightfitness,3dhyen,mariozxy,2,Thu Jul 16 20:54:57 2015 UTC,"Commenting to emphasize the importance of mobility as per personal experience.

bodyweightfitness,3dhyen,smnokey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:35:46 2015 UTC,"Fun variation to learn: Crow pose transition to tripod headstand and back to crow.   We sometimes did something similar: In a crow pose, try to touch your forehead to the ground in front of you without actually putting any weight on it, then back up into the crow pose. Or, similarly, try to push over a small object with your head without touching the ground. This is even more controlled than your transition (you can't just fall the last centimeters, or push back up with your head), but of course misses the tripod headstand as you never straighten your legs. Definitely fun!"
bodyweightfitness,3dhyen,ythri,5,Fri Jul 17 11:26:51 2015 UTC,"I worked on my crow for quite a while, and finally got to a point where I could hold it for a minute. But I'm not totally sure where to go from there. I've always had the problem that my knees want to slip off of my arms/elbows. Raising my knees seems to make things dramatically harder -- which I guess is the point. Just start from scratch doing the harder variation?  Straight arms seems nearly impossible for me at this point. Any tips?"
bodyweightfitness,3dhyen,elzeardclym,5,Thu Jul 16 15:41:38 2015 UTC,"Bent arm frog stand will not get you straight arm frog stand.  I'd recommend planche leans to work towards that.  For the knees up higher part, just do it in small steps."

bodyweightfitness,3dhyen,nedflanders1200,3,Thu Jul 16 14:45:42 2015 UTC,"if you're resting in the frog stand and taking it easy.... no.  if you're pushing down hard through the shoulders, trying to lift your knees all the way off your elbows.. you'll be doing more for your tuck planche."
bodyweightfitness,3dhyen,AcroATX,2,Thu Jul 16 18:34:46 2015 UTC,Good timing! I've had trouble here as well. I can crow pose for a minute while I can't frogstand with straight arms at all. I feel like my crow pose was fairly active. I've tried the frog in my last two sessions and just fall. It does feel like it's getting better though. I've started doing planche leans 5 days a week.   I'm also confused on what constitutes a tuck planche. I can lift myself off the ground with straight arms and hold for 3x10s with dumbbell paralletes. Without the dumbbells it's 3-4 seconds before my feet touch the ground. I just feel like my legs are hanging there as I have to actively try to hold them up and I don't feel like I have anything close to a straight back.
bodyweightfitness,3dhyen,ADDSail,4,Thu Jul 16 20:24:41 2015 UTC,That's how it starts. To straighten the back you have to lean more forward without face planting. This takes patience for the strength to be there.

bodyweightfitness,3dhxyk,Joshua_Naterman,2,Thu Jul 16 12:32:41 2015 UTC,"Is the Friday 5 sets of 1 rep @ 5RM for the first option or a single set of 5 reps going for a PR? The former doesn't really make sense to me, but I figured I'd just check to see.  If it's the latter, I'd consider also doing as many reps as you can with good form, not just stopping at 5. You may get 7-8 reps, and that probably means you should add 1-5 lbs the next Friday, but it's a fairly high intensity growth stimulus and will serve the purpose just fine if you're afraid going up in weight with the increments available will lead to only 3-4 reps and for whatever reason that's not acceptable, OR if you're afraid you may not be able to maintain form.    One thing to consider doing is a single set of the intensity day before the volume day's work sets, and also a single set of perhaps 3 reps instead of 5 with the same weight on the ""recovery"" day.  This is nowhere near enough volume to cause issues, but has several important benefits.  1) Post-Tetanic Potentiation/Facilitation: By using a heavier weight than your working sets, but not severely fatiguing your working muscles in the process, you will make it easier for your body to recruit the muscles, and you will have more power and often get 1-2 extra reps as a result.  2) You will be maintaining the neurological stimulus that is leading to your strength gains on the Intensity day, and your gains on that day will improve as a result.  A lot of people think you have to beat the shit out of yourself to improve, but the truth is that not every training effect responds to this approach.  Simply exposing yourself to the heavy weight without causing substantial muscle damage is all you need. It doesn't even have to be all 5 reps, and many people may find that if you do this with each main lift you're better off just doing 3 reps."
bodyweightfitness,3dhxyk,Joshua_Naterman,2,Thu Jul 16 22:54:01 2015 UTC,"Sets x Reps x Intensity  I've seen some variations on TM include a 5+ set, and I don't think that's a bad idea at all.  I'd say for the rest of the changes, you shouldn't forget that TM is a beginner intermediate program, and is known for it's simplicity. You could make these changes, but it wouldn't be TM any more.  It might be better, but TM definitely works well."

Friday (Intensity):   Pull Up variation - 3 x 2-5 x previous or harder variation Dip/HSPU variation - 3 x 2-5 x previous or harder variation Deadlift - 1 x 5 x 5RM (aim for a new PR)  or Step Up/Pistol variation - 5 x 2-5 x previous or harder variation.   Start the pull ups and dips with doubles or triples and progress to ~5 reps (adding a rep per set per) week before trying a new progression. Add 5lb to the deadlift each week.  Week 2  Monday (Volume):   Row variation - 5 x 5 x 8-10RM or Front Lever variation - 5 x 70-90% max hold Push Up variation - 5 x 5 x 8-10RM or Planche variation - 5 x 70-90% max hold Squat - 5 x 5 x 90% 5RM  or Step Up/Pistol variation - 5 x 5 x 5RM each side   Starting at 5 reps for the row and push up and adding 1 rep per set each week as long as it is driving up your Friday performance. If you're doing a static instead, you can either do an ~80% max hold of the tested time from the previous Friday, or you can do a previous progression and increase from 70%-90% in 5% increments before progressing. This routine doesn't have an intensity day for squats, so increase the weight of the squat to drive up the deadlift.

Start the pull ups and dips with doubles or triples and progress to ~5 reps (adding a rep per set per) week before trying a new progression. If you're doing a static, either do a max hold of the current progression to establish a new max, a max hold of a new progression to establish a new max, or 3 90% holds, trying to add ~5-10% each week.

You may not get full ROM (OH NOES! rolls eyes) but you'll still be working the muscles just fine.  I'm assuming there's no gym around, because if there is you should go there :)  You may also consider getting rope and hanging a dowel over a tree branch off the rope so that you can do pull ups off of that.   To do that: Securely attach the rope to the middle of the dowel, space hands evenly, and do pull ups. It requires a bit of balancing, but it's not as difficult as you might think.  EDIT: Obviously doorway pull up bars are excellent, someone else suggested one of those and it's a good idea."

bodyweightfitness,3djg3c,fun__on__a__bun,5,Thu Jul 16 19:32:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, its safe to use. It will support your weight.  The danger comes in readjusting your weight while on the bar, or swining around carelessly. The bar is designed to hold the weight at a steady momentum. if you ""jump"" (release your weight and then have it all apply back on) while using the bar, it may take the extra momentum poorly and drive the bar through the frame.  I have seen the above happen. My friend who is 6ft 180 has used his bar for a while. it was always stable until he one day re adjusted his weight mid-air. the momentum caused the bar to jolt against the frame with extra force and the panel above the door let go.  Basically if you're not being rowdy you should be fine. once you get rowdy the danger of ruining your structure becomes real."

The door/wall is thinner than normal so the pull-up bar wouldnt be tilted properly. In addition, the molding/door-frame is extremly thin so there isn't much for it to brace against. I have two sand juggling balls duct taped over the door frame to make the wall slightly thicker so it works.   It has only fallen off on me once while in use, and that was probably my own fault."

bodyweightfitness,3dj8i2,DrFingersShafer,2,Thu Jul 16 18:37:12 2015 UTC,I work out twice a week. If you have problems sleeping and notice you are getting weaker rather than stronger you work too much (or too often). You take deload weeks do you?
bodyweightfitness,3dj8i2,dorogov,2,Thu Jul 16 20:16:18 2015 UTC,"You know, depending on how long you have been doing this, there very well could be a greater need for rest between sessions.  You could be low on protein/rest, but I'm sure others will talk about that in detail so I'll let them.  In the world of weight lifting, I noticed a long time ago that new lifters do well on low volume full body routines that hit everything 3x/week, but as people get more big/strong/advanced they start needing something different. Most commonly you'll see the days split up more, with much more volume on each specific day. Guys start out doing something like Stronglifts 5x5 and end up doing more like a 5 day split with high volume.  I've experienced the same thing. The longer I train, the more I seem to enjoy murdering some move/muscle with volume once a week, and I'm finding over time that I pretty much need to work out that way now to respond to what I'm doing.  I suspect that this effect must also be found in BWF. When I tried my first legit BWF written by somebody else, it too was full body and I found myself getting worn down and not making progress on some things, but then I started splitting it up and raising the volume so it resembled my lifting. Instead of 3x8 on moves like one arm pushup progression, I ended up doing more like 5x10, for example. I started making great progress again and I started recovering much better.  I'm nearly 30 myself, maybe this is an age thing. I'm not sure, but I've really noticed as a rule that the older fit guys I see in the gyms I go to are almost universally doing some kind of split up bodybuilding routine rather than full body stuff. There seems to be something there, I just don't understand it.  Disclaimer: I'm not opposed to full body stuff at all, just calling things like I see them."

Handstands on your FISTS is not a progression route for handstands.

bodyweightfitness,3dfhn2,flyingsqueak,0,Wed Jul 15 22:51:14 2015 UTC,"Using handstand blocks helps. You can easily make your own by cutting 6 inch lengths of a 2x4 and sanding the edges. I like to put two strips of athletic tape on the bottom to make them not slippery. Using blocks with your fingers wrapped around the edges, your wrists will flex at a less extreme angle than flat on the floor. This is how hand balancers train handstands, and it feels more natural  than parallettes.   All that being said, I was hit by a car a few months ago and got a pretty severe ligament injury in one wrist and still train handstands with that hand in a fist--but I had a pretty strong handstand to begin with.

I have trouble folding my wrist back to 90° (so plank/pushups are impossible). Doc says it might still be healing but if I'm not OK in a few months I'm going back.   I find sports medicine clinics often take stuff like this more seriously. Hospitals are for not dying. Sports medicine is for striving for optimal performance.

bodyweightfitness,3ditsp,Innitinnuitinnit,4,Thu Jul 16 16:51:31 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're describing either the long head or the medial head of the triceps.  Taking a look at a google image search for ""triceps brachii"" will yield images like this one: http://www.bodyworkslifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/oi_tricep_brachii.jpg  This is a fairly good image because it shows the muscle belly of the medial head below the triceps tendon. Many people have two separate attachments on the forearm for the triceps, a tendinous attachment at the olecranon and also a separate ""anterior compartment"" that represents the medial head, and that tends to insert on the posterior ulna somewhat distal to the tendon itself.  You may just not be working the lateral head as hard as the other two heads.  To ""fix"" that, you can alter the way you face the cable so that you're kind of at a 30-45 degree angle instead of directly facing it, and you can also use something like a pencil to lightly scratch the lateral head to give you a specific feel for recruiting it. Using your own fingers will not help very much, but using an inanimate object will because you won't be getting two strong sensory signals confused.  Once you develop the feel for recruiting the lateral head you'll likely be able to include it in all of your other triceps work through conscious effort."
bodyweightfitness,3ditsp,Joshua_Naterman,2,Thu Jul 16 22:27:35 2015 UTC,"What an informative and detailed response. Thank you.  After having looked at some diagrams I believe the lateral, medial and tendon parts of the muscle are growing but I don't seem to have anything on the long head.  I don't use cables, BWE. But I use an exercise to replicated that motion - put hands out in front on a bar and then dip my head under and push back up - I also employ hands at sides dips and hands behind dips. I haven't been focusing on straight bar dips. Could this be the problem?"
bodyweightfitness,3ditsp,Joshua_Naterman,2,Thu Jul 16 23:43:44 2015 UTC,"Yes. That may not hit the long head very well... but weighted pull ups and rows work it just fine, just as the BW only versions do.  Just for clarity, I want to point out that the long head is the one that goes all the way up into the shoulder joint. It literally attaches to the bottom of the shoulder socket on the shoulder blade, it's the upper inner part in the picture. If you look at the ""V"" at the top of the triceps it is the left side.  A BW substitution could be FL pulls with straight arms, basically moving from vertical to inverted and back in whatever body position is manageable for you. You could also start inverted and just go down to whatever position is controllable and pull back up.  This does work lats, but it also works long head of the triceps.  If you have access to cables, I do recommend them. Used properly they can really be excellent for specific assistance work."
bodyweightfitness,3ditsp,Joshua_Naterman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:33:08 2015 UTC,"My tricep muscle starts two inches above my elbow, curls round and then dies about two inches below my lateral delt. That's what was confusing me.  Thanks. Are FL pulls much different from straight bar dips though? I was lead to believe that doing straight bar dips, the above head cable replacement, hands to the side dips and hands behind dips would cover everything. Sorry for all the questions."
bodyweightfitness,3ditsp,legatostaccato,2,Fri Jul 17 00:46:27 2015 UTC,"Very much different. You'll feel it immediately.   A technical explanation would be... difficult... without video, at least for someone without a strong anatomical knowledge base, but I'll try to keep it simple.  Basically, when your upper arm is movingin a direction that is from in front of your torso to behind your torso while the muscle is shortening (like pulling up in a pull up, or in a FL pull, or in a row), the long head of the triceps is working hard. It doesn't work that hard when the elbow is the primary moving joint.  Obviously the negative on the way down also works it, but the point is that dips aren't going to do much for long head of the triceps."
bodyweightfitness,3ditsp,dorfcally,2,Fri Jul 17 01:00:22 2015 UTC,the tricep muscle is what runs from below the shoulder to above your elbow..

bodyweightfitness,3dk8od,Iugiter,2,Thu Jul 16 23:06:01 2015 UTC,"For beginners, 3x a week is recommended in general because it familiarizes them with  the exercises and because the volume a beginner handles is much easier to recover from. In terms of BWF, movements are being trained rather than individual muscles, so it's hard/suboptimal to do a bodypart split.   Recommendations for lower frequency is for intermediate and advanced lifters who cannot recover from the volume they're dealing with. You could work each exercise one or two times a week and progress, albeit at a much slower pace. If you're completely new to BWF, follow the recommended routine or one of the routines with good reviews on this page."

What I was wondering was if something like this would work: Day 1: Bulgarian rows, HeSPU's. Day 2: biceps curls, PPPU's. Day 3: inverted chin-ups, ring dips. Day 4: either one of the previous pull exercises or pullups, and either one of the other push exercises.   The schedule could be anything from 2 days on 1 off 2 on, T,Th, Sat,Sun, or whatever."

Because you can't progress in everything at once for very long before something like this happens. For example, I made a switch to a handstand-centric routine because that's my goal. I've progressed further in my handstand in two weeks than I have training for over a year now. If your goal is to master the L-sit, your routine should be reflecting that."
bodyweightfitness,3djpmf,BePatient7,2,Thu Jul 16 20:41:45 2015 UTC,"Failure to progress most likely means that you simply need a better basic strength protocol as your primary training.

I also help people figure out how to get the most out of any self-imposed limitations, as well as not having access to a more ideal environment for training, but whenever possible I aim to get the best results possible and that does mean a very hybrid approach."

bodyweightfitness,3di1ai,cowpaycowbull,9,Thu Jul 16 13:04:54 2015 UTC,"No, the squat is the base of any strength training program. You do not under any circumstance skip leg day!  However, IF you look carefully at the beginner routine you will notice that it recommends 10 minutes of handstand practice. Once you've mastered the free standing handstand, you can incorporate HSPU's in your intermediate routine.   :-)"
bodyweightfitness,3di1ai,Gawd1,7,Thu Jul 16 13:25:34 2015 UTC,"Replace the squat? How did you possibly reach that conclusion? They aren't even remotely similar exercises.

bodyweightfitness,3di1ai,elzeardclym,2,Thu Jul 16 15:37:14 2015 UTC,Once you mastered your parallel bar dips you can switch those out for HSPU progressions.

bodyweightfitness,3di1ai,mmmr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:26:59 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to hi-jack this thread and ask a question regarding the handstand progression. I feel like 10 minutes with breaks is to ""unclear"", as it's not something defined, what I need.  What I started doing was to do 5 sets of handstands (stomach to wall) for a certain amount of time, if I can hold all 5 sets, I up the time by 1 second for each set.  Currently up to 26s seconds p/set with 60-90 seconds pause in between, is this a good alternative?"
bodyweightfitness,3di1ai,Nedrin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:50:03 2015 UTC,"I believe it is a vague ""do it for 10 minutes"" because it is not meant to be a progression for a beginner. It is simply there to help you learn the movement with good form.  I usually just get up in position, hold hollow body for as long as I can, come down, rest for about 90 seconds, then repeat. I do this until my form fails, then I move on. Sometimes I can do a bunch of sets, sometimes I do 2 sets and feel exhausted so I stop to reserve energy for the strength portion."
bodyweightfitness,3di1ai,billyjenkins,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:53:32 2015 UTC,"I do HSPUs instead of dips because I don't really have a good place to do dips, and it's fairly difficult to progress them beyond adding weights and I don't have any free weights.  I can't do a free standing handstand, but I do them with my back to the wall.  I really don't care about doing a freestanding hand stand.  I'm more interested in building strength."
bodyweightfitness,3di1ai,AestheticsAtWorrk,-1,Thu Jul 16 19:55:11 2015 UTC,Originally intended to have legs on another day but in hindsight it would probably require too much time out of schedule to train 6x a week. Perhaps it would be a better idea to have the L sit progression be a part of skill work and replace it with HSPU against a wall?
bodyweightfitness,3di1ai,Impudicity2001,2,Thu Jul 16 13:52:41 2015 UTC,"I think what you are missing is that you believe if you are not doing a concentric movement ( overhead press, HSPU) that you aren't building the muscle. This is false, eccentric and isometric exercises have shown to be more effective including giving your more resistance than you could in your concentric your 1RM. However, in this case let's focus on the the handstand isometric skill work. To the google machine..  I just quickly googled and this looks OK, but only skimmed, http://breakingmuscle.com/strength-conditioning/isometric-training-what-it-is-and-how-to-do-it-correctly  Doing 10 minutes of handstands is far better than cranking out 24 HSPUs, because thats 10 minutes of full engagement of the muscles needed versus 25 seconds in the concentric reps."

bodyweightfitness,3dh8z1,latetext12,4,Thu Jul 16 06:48:32 2015 UTC,"At the beginning of the year I couldn't do a HSPU. I just focused on elevated pike push ups. When I could do 3 sets of 12 those, I increased the height of my feet from 2' to nearly 3'. After I could do 3x12, I added plates under my hands to increase the ROM. Finally, when I was able to get 12 reps with +2"" ROM, I tried the HSPU again and was able to get 3 reps. This was all over the course of 3 months and I can now get 6 reps in a single set. Don't be afraid to move back and stay there a bit to make that big leap forward.   1 note on technique: I found that rotating my hands out slightly (3-5 degrees?) really helped me keep my elbows in tighter. I was able to stay in the groove way better after this."

Any more than that felt like over training. I only do HSPU once a week now and still am making slow & steady progress.  Have you tried raising your feet higher with the pike? Increasing your ROM (don't progress any faster than 1/2"" increments)? Different hand positions? I can't stress how much a difference a very slight outward turn made for me.   What about outside of pushing strength? Are you keeping your core tight enough? Are your hips & shoulders aligned throughout the lift? Can you lower your body fat pct.?"
bodyweightfitness,3dh8z1,Joshua_Naterman,3,Thu Jul 16 17:42:58 2015 UTC,"/u/yaad_mohammad is working on a very good tutorial for these, and it should be ready in a few weeks.   until then, just know that the pike HeSPU are a core part of the tutorial, and that they are a very good place to start.  If you use weights OR have access to them and want to supplement your HSPU, try doing single arm overhead press. I'll be doing a tutorial videon on those soon enough.  Remember that is basic strength, not specific HeSPU practice. We are working the muscles to make them stronger, and using HeSPU/HSPU to actually integrate the strength you gain into the movement itself.  One of the main reasons so many people have so much trouble progressing is that they try to use the skill itself as the strength training, and that is nearly always the least efficient way to go."

bodyweightfitness,3dh9mo,TerenzILL,7,Thu Jul 16 06:57:31 2015 UTC,"You have to understand that a handstand is in reality not really a static position. You're constantly either over- or underbalancing, and correcting that. If you're overbalancing (the weight goes to the front of your fingers), you need to push down your fingertips in the ground and allow that correction to travel up through the body. The drill to practice that is called a heel pull, and you can find a video tutorial here. You can also practice it one leg at a time. If you're underbalancing (the weight goes to your wrists), there are a couple things you can do. You can planche it out (though you need to be strong for this), you can bend the elbows a little, or you can break your line at the hip a bit, get the center of mass back in the right spot, and straighten out. I prefer the last correction. The drill to practice this is called a toe pull, and you can find a video tutorial here. Like heel pulls, you can also practice it one leg at a time. If you got these drills down, you can use a forearm supported handstand, to figure out what corrections to apply where. It's a bit odd at first, but a nice drill once you get the hang of it.  Two cues that are extremely helpful in balancing and body tension, respectively, are to push the shoulders up continuously, and squeeze the legs together. Practice your hollow holds like this too. You could also think about spreading the floor with your hands in order to get better shoulder activation.  Hope that helps."
bodyweightfitness,3dh9mo,161803398874989,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:56:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this long answer! I have to add that I really tried to do my research on the Internet. I've read and watched all I could about the HS. So in theory...I'm aware of this :) The more I train, I also find that these tips you find in those tutorials start to make sense. For example it is a great feeling once you get to point your toes or squeeze your butt because you actually get that far and don't fall over a second after you kicked up into the HS.  I haven't practiced heel and toe pulls yet however. So this is great advice and I will try to add these to my training.  What to do when you over- or underbalance is probably the most important Thing. I can correct minor misbalances but most often my correction is not ""strong"" enough to keep me from falling over.  Thank you for this!"
bodyweightfitness,3dh9mo,pvv052,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:45:24 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere that HS is a skill that you can never master completely, so it's always a progress. I'd recommend you to practice it regularly in the beginning of every workout for 5-10 minutes and stop comparing yourself to anybody. We all have different bodies, injuries, etc. Also don't forget that you need strength in your whole body to do proper handstand, so don't neglect your workout routine. Hope this helps."
bodyweightfitness,3dh9mo,Cyborg15,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:49:18 2015 UTC,"I can promise you that I don't neglect my other workout :)  Like I said, at the Moment my level just doesn't seem to be high enough yet so that 5-10mins are enough. After 10 mins my handstands start to feel right, and muscles are warm and I need another 20mins or so to get something out of the session. I then have about 1-3 good HS of 10-15s and lots of 3-5 ones."

After that you can do RFESS, again in goblet fashion until you run out of weight, but then move to a dumbbell in each hand.  If you max out on that, you're hella strong.  You should probably deadlift as well.  If your gym has a no-deadlift policy, use a pair of Dumbbells and do it from one leg."

bodyweightfitness,3dg3xi,DaveDYEL,2,Thu Jul 16 10:39:14 2015 UTC,"The truth is that a combined approach will very likely work best, but one can achieve quite a lot of success with either bilateral or proper unilateral squat progressions.  I am a big fan of Boyle's approach to athletic improvement. He's absolutely right about the back often being the weak link, and that's pretty obvious to anyone who's every gotten under a barbell and learned to do heavy split squats.  For reference, I weigh 225ish lbs.  I can do 7-8 reps of 210 lbs in a front rack split squat but only 2 reps of 285 in a front rack. When you put my foot on a scale and see ~45-60 lbs on the back foot, you realize pretty quick that the other 375-390 lbs is on my front leg.   Comparing that to the ~260ish lbs per leg during the front squat, it's pretty easy to see the difference. I realize there's some correction that has to be done there for lower leg weight, but the massive difference remains massive and that's the point for the casual reader :)  At the same time, I notice that I get very different development from each, and that my best progress happens when I hit very high weight, very low rep front squats (285ish for me right now) combined with higher volume on the split squats.  While this hasn't been examined directly in strength training research, plyometrics HAVE been compared between unilateral, bilateral, and combined... and the combined group blew away both individual groups. That was published a few months ago in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research."
bodyweightfitness,3dg3xi,Joshua_Naterman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:56:51 2015 UTC,"Depends on how much weight you have to hold in your hands :)  You can get more by also progressing through split squats and then Bulgarian split squats with weight held in the ""Goblet"" position, which will help you get some additional resistance out of the available weight."

You wouldn't think that 12-17g is a lot of sugar, but when a tiny bit feeds your Yeast infection - it is.  There are low and no sugar yogurts, but their awesome factor is considerably lower.  Instead I've done some probiotics, and also added oat groats and unmodified potato starch to my diet.  The probiotics act as a temporary injection of the digestive bacteria I've killed off.  The groats and starch act as a prebiotic, which feed the existing bacteria and help grow new stuff.  On top of it the oats have enzymes that naturally kill off yeast.  It's all crazy mad science...

It's not quite the same as your situation, but similar.    Cutting is possible.  You can lose the gut.  I did.  I'm down to 34"" from 40"" so I know it can be done.

Ingesting any dairy makes breathing difficult so I strenuously avoid all dairy.  I would like to eat dairy.  I miss eating cheeses and ice cream.  However, all the stuff I would eat if I could would really mess with my macros and throw off my progress.  Learning the discipline to actively avoid all dairy has helped me control my other food intake.   6 month cut is some serious dedication   Dedication is the key.
