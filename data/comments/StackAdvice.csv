I never took either medication on a daily basis, and have always avoided taking it unless I felt like I needed to (When I was in school that was 4-5 times a week. Now that I'm in the workforce, maybe 2-3). IMO, they actually work better when you only use them occasionally, because you don't develop a tolerance."
StackAdvice,3e339t,nootropist,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:44:21 2015 UTC,"I suspect the reason why Adderall works better for many is that in directly affects release (which can be excitotoxic) of catecholamines while Methylphenidate only inhibits reuptake, so you won't have much of rush, but if you do stimulating things (such as say studying or exercising) you get more stimulation out of them. This is also probably why Methylphenidate works poorly for motivation, but this can be easily fixed by combining it with Sulbutiamine (produces very motivating and super-speedy effect, not that good for brainwork, but perfect for physical work such as cleaning your house/yard or doing some construction/repairs) which is much better idea than increasing dosage as Methylphenidate is really horrible on high doses and leads typically to crash.  This reminds me that I have yet to discover stimulant cocktail for clean feeling, but strong mental stimulation. L-theanine, Noopept and low-dose Methylphenidate seems to be best, but it's not that strong really and upping the dose on Methylphenidate tends to make things more physical. Possibly, RC-compounds typically used as psychedelics could act as very good and clean brainwork stimulants on low doses, but I haven't personally researched that field yet and I'm not sure are there any good RC-psychedelics that are still legal or just icky and dangerous stuff like benzofurans. I remember when I was younger and 2-CB was legal, I used it often as party drug on low doses and it had very clean feeling nice stimulation without any visual or mentally disturbing effects."

However, if you're young and this is your first time experiencing something like that you should be careful. Mania can interfere with your impulse control for example and for someone with no prior experience on how to handle things it might lead to bad decisions. Although, I don't think it's very likely you have mania given your antipsychotic medication. Probably it's just Tianeptine working well for you. Do you sleep less?

StackAdvice,3e235p,Vegetano,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:35:22 2015 UTC,"I use Zolpidem some times (usually only as an emergency sleep medication when traveling, partying or having accidental overstimulation from stimulants) and it works well as long as I go to bed and try to sleep. It won't make me sleepy though, but just gives benzo-like ""high"" that last for about two hours. I would say that Zopiclone is much better for inducing sleep and makes you more tired being more stronger than Zolpidem. However, it causes much more worse foul taste in the morning after than Zolpidem does. It might also make you feel more tired next day since it has much longer half-life than Zolpidem. Good thing about Zolpidem is it's very short half-life, so being tired when waking up is not much of an issue with it.  Also with these compounds addiction (not so much psychological, but actual real physical dependence) and withdrawal is a real issue, so one should be very careful. On higher doses (beyond 10mg or so) many people also experience weird hallucinations and delirium, but usually without tolerance 5mg is enough for sleeping and shouldn't cause weird things to happen. There is also the fact that for some people these drugs cause sleepwalking. I have never had that happen to myself despite using these for long time, but it is very dangerous (in worst cases people have ended up driving while sleeping) side-effect you should watch out for. Care should be taken when using these with alcohol, while not dangerous unless you're drinking very heavily (which itself is bad too idea and should be avoided, it's more fun to drink in moderation) it does greatly enhance the effects and thus you shouldn't take them before going to bed unless you want to be very delirous.   In your case I would try Agmatine (in my personal experience this is very sleep inducing supplement discounting addictive stuff like Phenibut), L-theanine and Picamilon though because benzos and benzo-like sleep meds are more for emergency knock-outs than daily use."

StackAdvice,3dy2dt,Barrel_O_Ska,3,Mon Jul 20 15:49:30 2015 UTC,"I remember reading an explanation for the hangover-induced hypomania somewhere. I know that chronic alcohol consumption can cause a lowering of BDNF expression, but I think there is some sort of reaction to occasional binge-drinking that the body undergoes where it releases a bunch of BDNF, or something. I need to quest around for awhile longer, unless someone else (hopefully) knows what I'm talking about and can point us in the right direction.  I used to be the same way: it didn't happen if I binged too often, but after one of those really good benders, when you wake up still kind of drunk, I would get this upwelling of creativity, even brilliance, all comfortably wrapped in a relaxed and outgoing package.  I think the anxiolysis was, obviously, a side effect of the huge GABAdic dosage from the night prior, I think the creativity was, indeed, due to a BDNF+ reaction of the brain to such abuse. For BDNF increase.  So you need higher cirulating GABA and more BDNF getting released in the brain: fortunately, cardio exercise does both of these things. If you aren't exercising at least every other day, start--even if you have to start slow and easy. Make a pact with yourself to only watch your favorite show when you exercise--get yourself a pavlovian conditioning with a good, favored stimulus. Once your body starts getting used to it, push your limits. Just as drug quality is essential to good drug effects, exercise quality is essential to good exercise effects. Change up your routine and remember that you never have the perfect regimen because your body is constantly adapting to what you do.  If you are looking for a drug that would work similarly to exercise or even boost your ability to exercise, I would recommend you try out NASELANK; very chill peptide that increases BDNF expression significantly while chilling you out like you've been meditating for hours."
StackAdvice,3dy2dt,Debonaire_Death,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:18:49 2015 UTC,"I read that link years ago, and though I no longer drink, can relate to feeling more centered the day of a hangover. My guess would be it's methylation, GABA or Dopamine related.  If you haven't already, get a panel done with a doctor to see if you have nutrient imbalances or underlying issues, then a genetic test from 23andme to check methylation issues. Neither of these will tell you everything, but they can help understand more about your system.   Anything that puts you in the moment and out of your head will help, like cardio in the morning. Get diet in check because any inflammatory response can really affect the mind's ability to be present and from what I read that seems to be what you're describing. Theanine and various adaptogens helped me to varying degrees for 10years >, but one thing that really helped was about 5 drops of lavender extract in some water. There is also a lavender extract called silexan that works too well for me, but might help you. It's in a product called calm aid that is easy to find and cheap.

First off, any medications he takes should be HIS decision to take, not your family's.   Please keep in mind I'm not a doctor, so take what I say with a grain of salt, and as things that have worked for me.  They won't necessarily work for him or someone else.  I'll say I can't believe the first thing so many doctor's seem to go immediately to anti-psychotics, even more so on an 18 year old's brain. What it sounds like to me is that he needs a mood stabilizer.  I personally have used Lamotrigine (Lamictal) for a number of years now and have found it helps dramatically, as well as being a fairly safe drug without a ton of potentially dangerous side effects.  There are safety issues that come along with starting the drug (SJS), which is why he should be weened onto it slowly.  Most doctors are aware of that though.  People seem to generally praise lamictal as being an awesome mood stabilizer.  The only negative thing I'll say about it is it has made learning more difficult for me (google lamictal stupids), although my cognitive issues seem to be pretty limited compared to some people's (it seems to be a very small minority of people who deal with these issues too). Also, the increased stability has thus far offset any cognitive decline I've had, which is mostly just taking longer to really learn new material rather than limiting what I'm capable of.  I actually turned to nootropics to help me offset this, and even just using Alpha-GPC helps me out a good bit.  Basically, be very wary of any drugs they recommend, and go for a mood stabilizer. Look up lamictal and let him see if it's worth it (it is worth a shit in my opinion. Just because they prescribe something doesn't mean you have to take it.  The first shrink I went to tried to put me on some crazy ass drugs.  I got a second opinion and the second shrink couldn't believe what the other doctor had tried to put me on.

I have undiagnosed bipolar, and I find that marijuana--smoked once a day in the evening--can help me a great deal without the myriad side effects of antipsychotics. That's probably why I'm undiagnosed: my mother has bipolar and watching her go through different combos of meds was nightmarish due to their side effects. Most drugs approved for treating bipolar scare the shit out of me.  If cannabis is illegal where you live and your parents are unwilling to pursue such an option, there is also a new cannabinergic research chemical that stops the breakdown of anandamide, which is your body's natural cannabinoid.

StackAdvice,3dunmj,Orkimed,2,Sun Jul 19 17:22:32 2015 UTC,greetings comrade  I would keep the alpha GPC because choline-bitartrate may not increase choline levels in the brain substantially. Check that link for a better explanation.   you may not need memantine just yet. I think most people use it to reverse tolerance to stimulants like caffeine. If you want to add it that should be fine but you must carefully research proper use and dose because it is strong.   most the your stack can be used long term but you will develop a tolerance to caffeine so it might be beneficial to find another stimulant so that you can use caffeine for a few weeks then use the other stimulant for a few weeks and prevent and (hopefully) prevent tolerance.   you can use uridine and caffeine together. It might also be beneficial to add Omega 3 fish oil because it works with uridine really well.  caffeine anhydrous is a common form of caffeine used for stimulation and increase focus.

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a glutathione (GSH) precursor and direct antioxidant. In this study, we investigated the effects of NAC on acute ethanol-induced liver damage. Female ICR mice were administered by gavage with a single dose of ethanol (6g/kg). NAC was administered in two different modes. In mode A, mice were injected with different doses of NAC at 30min before ethanol. In mode B, mice were injected with different doses of NAC at 4h after ethanol. Acute ethanol-induced liver damage was estimated by measuring serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity and histopathological changes. Result showed that a single dose of ethanol (6g/kg) caused a significant increase in serum ALT activity, followed by microvesicular steatosis and necrosis in mouse liver. Pretreatment with NAC significantly protected against acute ethanol-induced liver damage in a dose-independent manner. Correspondingly, pretreatment with NAC significantly attenuated acute ethanol-induced lipid peroxidation and GSH depletion and inhibited hepatic TNF-alpha mRNA expression. By contrast, post-treatment with NAC aggravated ethanol-induced hepatic lipid peroxidation and worsened acute ethanol-induced liver damage in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, NAC has a dual effect on acute ethanol-induced liver damage. Pretreatment with NAC prevent from acute ethanol-induced liver damage via counteracting ethanol-induced oxidative stress. When administered after ethanol, NAC might behave as a pro-oxidant and aggravate acute ethanol-induced liver damage."

I drink coffee too but I  find I still need to supp w/ caffeine to reap the full benefits of the synergism between caffeine and theanine. Rhodiola can offer some stim and mood enhancement but I've found you need to up the dose from what is recommended; I think this is how most ppl feel too. Unfortunately it needs to be cycled to avoid tolerance dulling the experience once you find your dose. The memory enhancements due to Bacopa are known to take some time to kick in."
StackAdvice,3dqsfo,lastPharaoh37,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:57:05 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of rhodiola needing to be cycled. Also, taking more than 600mg a day is not likely to be helpful due to its U-shaped dose-response curve.   Bacopa should take 8-12 weeks for the memory effects to set in. Take bacopa with food btw!  I might recommend a racetam as well since they provide some nice focus and short-term memory enhancing effects. They pair very well with choline supplements like Alpha-GPC. Piracetam is a great place to start. Cheap and easy. I recommend about 2g three times a day."
StackAdvice,3dqsfo,thrivenotes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:17:59 2015 UTC,"cycling prevents tolerance right? IDK if it means something else but that is how I was referring to it. If you had ever taken rhodiola you wouldn't need to hear it - you would have experienced it just as I and others have. There is a definite tolerance that builds to rhodiola so taking it consistently will result in diminishing effects - namely the light stimulation and mood enhancement that it provides. I've found it to be more of a mood enhancer than stimulant but other report stimulation especially for ceretropics super rhodiola.   I've never seen any U shaped response curve for Rhodiola given its more of a mood enhancer than stimulant, but it would be highly dependent on body size and other personal factors. Every response curve I've ever seen doesn't even list actual dosages on the horizontal axis - just increasing dose from left to right. This is because the recommended dose is typically the lowest possible dose  but that isn't universal."
StackAdvice,3dqsfo,lastPharaoh37,2,Sat Jul 18 21:52:51 2015 UTC,"Have taken rhodiola; haven't experienced tolerance. Do you have any research that supports what you say you've seen and nor seen?   P.S. it's not always about what you've seen.   Relevant examine.com link: http://examine.com/supplements/Rhodiola+Rosea/   As rhodiola has been shown to have a bell-curve response before, it is recommended to not exceed the aforementioned 680mg dosage as higher doses may be ineffective.   Great info there. Truly. Those guys do an awesome job."
StackAdvice,3dqsfo,thrivenotes,2,Sun Jul 19 08:46:06 2015 UTC,oh yes. no wonder I couldn't find the curve - U shaped and bell shaped curves have different meanings and there isn't a U shaped curve associated w/ rhodiola but there is a Bell shaped dose response curve. Interestingly I can't find the source for that 680 mg upper bound dose claim on the page. I trust examine fully but I also work in data science and its clear to me that 680 mg is a statistical upper bound. A hypothetical situation might be - for 65% of the population the dose 680 mg is the upper bound beyond which response decreases. There is no way its universal - it just can't be because you would need to study the entire population to make it universal. Given that there is 7 billion ppl here... impossible. so they drew some conclusions using a sample; thus 680 mg not universal. I should note I don't actually take more than 600 mg. The rec dose for my Rhodiola is 275 mg and I take about 600 mg because 275 mg just didn't do it for me. Just last night I tried 1 gram but I also mixed it w/ coluracetam and phenibut so I can't be sure what effect it had.  The only way it could be universal is if there is some process in the body that makes it so but I've plenty of experience w/ drugs and I've never known that to be true. I think its more likely that everyone follows a bell shaped response curve but the actual dosages at which the responses begins to decrease is highly dependent on the person.  I don't have any science to back up the claim of tolerance but its something that is readily perceived. There are also other claims on reddit and some product reviews of rhodiola that mention tolerance. Its possible that you don't respond strongly to rhodiola and in that case tolerance is a non issue. Its like w/ vitamin C - you can't develop tolerance because you can't perceive any effects to begin w/.

Coffee is not bad for serotonin. In fact, it has MAOIs in it that should be boosting serotonin among other things--things such as dopamine and norepinephrine, unfortunately. With this in mind, you might want to cut that out of your stack and go for something like tea, which has the caffeine without the trace MAOIs.  If you want a natural approach, St. John's Wort (Perika brand), Bacopa, and Ashwagandha are three herbs off the top of my head that distinctly raise serotonin levels.  The drug I've tried with the most potential for raising tonic serotonin levels is bromantane. I love that drug, except for the fact that I always have to pair it with a serotonin-lowering buffer drug of some sort if I want to avoid anxious lethargy. I was taking 75-100mg per day. I have never been impressed by 50mg/day despite its common listing as a starting dose.  Also, exercise gives your body a natural outlet to use up excess excitatory neurotransmitters."

StackAdvice,3dptqv,Puggy858,2,Sat Jul 18 07:24:45 2015 UTC,"If you're feeling jittery and experiencing a comedown, my first advice would be to reduce dosage. Then, next on the list is use the stimulation from the Vyvanse for productivity and reinforcing positive habits in your life. Make sure you're eating/drinking/exercising/sleeping EXCELLENTLY, because these are all things that can be interrupted by amphetamine use.  Gonna be honest, not sure what dose you're taking but if Vyvanse is giving you comedowns you might be like me and be very sensitive to stims. I still like small doses (probably 1/3 of what most people take to get me going) but the only thing that will deal with the side effects are full on benzos. That's okay for once-in-a-while recreational use, but I couldn't imagine taking a stim/benzo combo daily. I'd end up not quite realizing what I was getting myself into until I found myself physically needing a benzo as well as fiending for more Adderal or meth or 3-FPM or what-have-you.  Chemically, you can try valerian, ashwagandha, kava... maybe lemon balm or theanine. You might see minor results but for me personally, nothing short of a powerful GABAergic like a benzo or alcohol will completely deal with the downsides of stimulants.  Your best bet is using any benefit you're receiving from the Vyvanse to start the process of long-term potentiation of healthy habits using the increased motivation and excess dopamine.  You're looking to take this drug to help you with your problems, not send you to reddit searching for another remedy to deal with the new issues.  Stacking any kind of supplements or medication should always be last after a healthy diet and lifestyle. Or rather, you should be using nootropics totake your baseline (100%) up to 110-120% or so. Using them as an easy fix to get out of a state where you're more like 50-60% of normal, and trying to just get up to your baseline, will not end as positively.  Also, Zoloft and any monoamine releasing agent, like dextroamphetamine, sounds like a bad call. Not saying it will definitely kill you, but take your normal meds on a much more empty stomach than usual or something like that and you may end up with an unpleasant experience. Just something to maybe talk to your doc about. Might be a legitimate case but almost no one needs to take 3 different medications daily as well as one more on some days. How long have you been on them? What other measures are you taking beyond chemical ones?"

It'll help balance out the edge while maximizing focus and such.   After that you have some options:   If you really want quick, clean focus, take uridine or CDP choline in the morning, (look up doses on examine.com, I'd do it for you but I'm on my phone.) then, about 4 hours before your cram sessions, take 50mg of Bromantane, 40mg of Tianeptine Sulfate from ceretropic.com (keyword: sulfate. Tianeptine sodium is not what you're looking for right now.) and then 45 minutes before your session, squirt 100mcg of ceretropic's NA-Semax Amidate nasal spray up your nose. You'll feel clean, focused, and without anxiety.   On some days, if you're okay with a little bit of anxiety, you can cycle  Phenylpiracetam+Alpha GPC (don't take cdpcholine and alpha gpc together, too much.) instead of semax/tianeptine/bromantane. Also, Rhodiola is useful for increased wakefulness when you need it. You could do 3 days of Rhodiola, 3 days of sem/tian/bro, and 2 days of phenylpiracetam.   This ain't gospel, experiment a little.

Based on what I'm seeing here, cortisol release is part of a negative feedback to prevent further CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone) release. Perhaps your morning suppression of cortisol is leading to decreased negative-feedback-mediated sedation in the evening, which is then synergizing with the NASEMAXA, resulting in insomnia."

StackAdvice,3dhcea,GameofLoot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:33:58 2015 UTC,"I thinking you might not need piracetam, I have many of the same nootropics and decided to skip it given noopept. Something else you might consider is switching alpha gpc to cdp choline and adding a fish oil. Yes its true the cdp choline is a little more expensive but it also provides more benefits including increasing uridine. check out the powdercity page for sources explaining its synergism w/ fish oil and why its important.   Another thing I did is get the nootropics sampler because it comes w/ all the racetams you are purchasing and choline bitartrate but you still save money from getting each of the racetams individually; so you get the choline bitartrate for free; so why not? It doesn't come w/ coluracetam or phenylpiracetam though but you still save money because it comes w/ all the others. The choline bitartrate is good is you take the cdp choline in the AM but decide to administer a racetam later in the day  - just throw a little bitartrate in there w/ it. A great combo to try is coluracetam and oxiracetam with oxiracetam oral and coluracetam not oral i.e. sublingual or insufflation. The recommended coluracetam dose is freaking tiny so sublingual or insufflation is totally feasible. Personally I insufflate and find the effects very noticeable. soon I'll make a nasal spray but haven't got around to it yet.  I also got DHEA because there are tons of research indicating testosterone ( I assume you're a dude - apologies if not) is like a fountain of youth. But, I am sort of regretting not getting pregnenolone. as other have pointed out, gotta be careful w/ these so I cycle DHEA in a sort of random way. I am ordering pregnenolone from amazon soon and will do the same cycling.    Some things I am looking to get soon are curcumin, quercetin, shilajit, and emoxypine. Quercetin mostly because its been shown to inhibit formation of AGEs or advanced glycation endproducts.

StackAdvice,3dfo0m,_86JR_,2,Wed Jul 15 22:13:34 2015 UTC,"oh yes - I've been in this situation countless times. not exactly the same but occasionally I have to sit down and bang out hours of work on the computer writing code. It happened frequently in school because I am sort of a procrastinator and would let work build up for a bit - I'm working on that though. This is just my opinion and it works great for me. so heres the deal, you need a stimulant and a mood enhancer. its a careful balance though because you can't get too wired/anxious bcuz that makes working efficiently untenable. So you'll need something to smooth out the stimulant like l-theanine or similar compounds.   Everyone responds different to different compounds so you'll have to try out a few before you find your sweet spot.  some stimulants to considering are caffeine, bromantane, the class of -afinils, but maybe a shorter acting one like hydrafinil (@ ceretropic) so you can redose if needed w/out affecting sleep, unifram, DMAA (@ ceretropic) is very popular and some others.  mood enhancers are a more complex issue. people find tianeptine to be effective and I've found this to be true. as long as you use the recommended dosages then there are no issues w/ this. some ppl may feel the need to preach about tianeptine addiction but that is only if you use recreational doses. Its approved in the EU for depression so there have been plenty of human studies. I ordered some and used it a few times. had no urge to redose or abuse despite my proclivity for recreational drugs. Also agomelatine (@ ceretropic) may be effective here but I haven't tried it yet so can't be sure - but it is designed for this sort of issue and approved in the EU also. There are also some natural mood boosters like rhodiola, NALT - I've tried both but I am not sure they are strong enough for the type of grooling session you are describing, but its possible you will respond stronger than I did so definitely consider it. Tolerance issues exist w/ both NALT and rhodiola tho so you'll need to cycle w/ something else to keep the effects strong.   to smooth out the simulant, if needed, definitely consider theanine, coluracetam, and some others.  these just deal w/ two facets of nootropics so you'll want to consider other compounds for other purposes like neuroprotection,memory,creativity etc. but the above should cover mood enhancement, focus, and energy.   Note: I indicated the vendor ceretropic for some compounds because AFAIK they are the only vendors who supply it; everything else can be obtained other places like amazon,powdercity, and others. check the fAQ and beginner's guide for more vendors."

It works just fine as an antidepressant without you having to feel subjective effects right away. Really. I promise. It enabled me to learn better coping mechanisms to deal with the stress of my former job and prevented panic attacks. It helped me habituate to the noxious stimuli at work, to use Pavlovian terminology. Indeed, it down modulates glutamate receptors in the amygdala while enhancing glutamatergic effects in the hippocampus (which is involved in attenuating to sensory stimuli both in short term habituation and also filtering of auditory stimuli via P50 waves). It does have opioid receptor affinities which is what induces the euphoria with large doses but dosing until you feel those effects is not necessary for the clinical effects and is what is likely to put you at addiction risk.

It just says amphetamine and methamphetamine, but not anything about substituted amphetamines as a class, but that could be a translation issue. But vyvanse isn't listed as okay either.  It's also currently undergoing clinical trials in Japan. So I dunno ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Your options are to either contact them a head of time, take it with you and hope for the best (just don't try to smuggle it and declare it if asked), or try something in a different class.  Methylphenidate will help, but it may not be as effective as adderall for you. Everyone is different, so I can't say how it'll make you feel, but in my experience, they will both keep you functioning, but only one of them optimally so.  If you need your brain working, but can deal with a bit of a cognitive drop, ask for Methylphenidate. Alternatively, if this is a vacation where it's okay if your ADHD is acting up, you might just want to use this as a tolerance break.  If you're worried about withdrawal, you should be fine. Addiction is rare with appropriate medical use. If you're really worried, try stopping it for a day. If you don't get withdrawl symptoms, you probably won't later."

I don't recommend it. Talk to your doctor and go for the methylphenidate. If for some reason he refuses, which seems unlikely given the situation, then you could order some modafinil from modacat. I got mine in 8 days. I don't have ADHD so I can't speak to its efficacy in treating it but I've read it can help.   You could just take the adderall w/ you? If you are willing to smuggle RC's in then why not? break it up and put it in capsules. maybe that is too high risk I don't know."

I have read some studies suggesting it's good for menopausal women though. It's just a nutrient rich food (which tastes like a camels ass) as far as I know.  Have you tried just regular theanine? I used to drink Matcha until my liver seemed to start responding to it negatively, so I cut it out. It gave me a heavy, but nice feeling in the head. After that I've tried theanine (sublingually), but that had no effect on me. Perhaps I should give suntheanine a shot. Haven't really researched the subject very well yet."
StackAdvice,3daz07,SuccessItself,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:45:38 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, suntheanine is regular theanine.  The natural version found in foods is L-theanine (as opposed to the synthetic D-isomer).  Some company copyrighted it, so others have to pay some royalties if they use that process to manufacture the pure natural stuff.  The bottle just says ""L-theanine"" with a little suntheanine logo on the back.  In the past, theanine didn't do jack for me at 200mg+, but perhaps things are different now that I'm eating a different diet, with different supplements, over a different baseline feeling of calm focus.  (iirc, a ketogenic diet turns up GABA and alters glutamine processing.  I've also been drinking lemon balm tea at night which I believe also alters GABA.)  This morning I brewed 50mg of theanine in with my first cup of coffee and the taste was actually great.  Apparently the theanine gives green tea part of it's good flavor, and can act sort of like MSG as a flavor enhancer.  Noticeable, but still unhelpful at this dosage / timing.  I did come across this which is interesting for a hyper-responder:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10737183   the stimulatory effects of caffeine were inhibited by an i.v. administration of theanine at a level higher than 5 micromol/kg (0.781 mg/kg).  On the other hand, the excitatory effects were shown in the rat i.v. administered 1 and 2 micromol/kg (0.174 and 0.348 mg/kg) b.w. of theanine alone. These results suggested two effects of theanine, depending on its concentration.   http://www.life-enhancement.com/magazine/article/2909-theanine   Results showed that a suppressive effect of theanine on caffeine stimulation emerged at higher than 10 μmol/kg, (1.742 mg/kg) b.w. of theanine. At very low doses (2 μmol/kg (0.348 mg/kg) b.w.), however, theanine exerted a stimulatory effect.   At 140lb, this would be the difference between a 22mg dose and a 50-100mg dose."

StackAdvice,3d8zjv,herman_gill,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:18:18 2015 UTC,"MDMA does cause brain damage, but it's pretty much completely reversible brain damage.  Prolonged cocaine use is the one that causes the permanent brain damage.  But profound hypertension + vasoconstriction + tachycardia can cause permanent damage in long term abusers of all of them, it's just much much much more likely with meth and cocaine."
StackAdvice,3d8zjv,KallistiTMP,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:49:55 2015 UTC,"Right, in the sense that yes, if you take enough MDMA to constrict your blood vessels to the point that they cut off oxygen to parts of the brain, those parts would die. But in application the amount of MDMA you would need to consume in order to develop permanent damage is way, way beyond the recreational dose. Its effects on the vascular system are actually pretty weak, at least compared to it's psychoactive effects - the vast majority of MDMA deaths are due to people getting too high to realize they're dehydrated, deaths related to MDMA's vasoconstrictive effects are exceedingly rare."
StackAdvice,3d8zjv,herman_gill,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:54:25 2015 UTC,"I wasn't talking about death.  Tachycardia + mild hypertension + hyponatremia (from drinking too much water or peeing too much) or hypernatremia (from not drinking enough water and peeing too much) in addition to volume depletion = problems.  People should check their heart rates on MDMA, and if they have a BP cuff their BP too compared to baseline levels.  Also ecstasy is very often cut with amphetamines (either methamphetamine or even just plain ephedrine) and plain old caffeine too. You get all these stimulants at once and it has a synergistic (not just additive) effect. MDMA (and not just ecstasy) often contains MDA and MDEA because of less than perfect creation and filtration of the product, and those are both more neurotoxic (not by an insane margin, but still). MDMA on it's own is enough to cause reversible brain damage and changes in receptor densities/regulation and other stuff.  The same is true of cocaine + levamisole (which might turn into aminorex) and ephedrine and caffeine are common cuts in cocaine too, and even meth sometimes (it's a lot cheaper than coke).  Alcohol has similar semi-permanent and eventually permanent effects as well, and combining MDMA with alcohol or cocaine with alcohol potentiates the negative effects of both.  Alcohol is much more dangerous than MDMA for the whole body long term, but that doesn't mean any of these drugs are completely free of harm, just because something else is worse. Anything that causes a ""hangover effect"" is obviously having a negative impact on the body. Particularly if the hangover/withdrawal/negative side effects last days to weeks, and not just a day.  Anything that also causes increased diuresis is also going to deplete levels of serum electrolytes including sodium, potassium, magnesium (a big one, particularly in alcohol and even caffeine to a smaller degree), and even zinc. All these are required for optimal function, and you're messing with the body's homeostasis and stores of them.  Interestingly enough cannabis might actually ameliorate (but not completely) some of the negative effects associated with cocaine, mdma, and alcohol when coingested with any of them."

Yes, it's bad for you, but it's well within the realm of what most people consider acceptably safe. Also yes, one of the problems with MDMA is that it's rarely MDMA, and often something much more dangerous - marquis reagent testing is highly recommended.

It impairs task performance, increases impulsivity, causes something called semantic interference (so does meth, much worse) which is basically like long term ADHD, worsens gambling performance, downregulates D2 receptors, increases the amount of opiod receptors (might increase why formed cokeheads are more likely to become alcoholics or nicotine dependent after), causes periventricular lesions... these are all long term effects after long term abstinence of 2+ years, and some of them start to happen as soon as you do it the first 10 or so times.  The periventricular lesions are basically minor brain bleeds from mini-strokes, the same thing happens to small parts of the heart tissue, and you can also get fibrosis if you're drinking (cocaethylene), and then mesenteric ischemia in the gut... Powerful vasoconstriction = bad news.  Then there's also the negative effects of levamisole which something like 75% of coke is cut with (at most of the sources)."

There D2 receptor downregulation is well documented as well (happens with a few other drugs too, CDP-Choline might ameliorate it to a degree in addition to long term absintence, you can check that out on examine), but I'm too lazy to look for more right now.  The acute effects of cocaine use are well documented, ranging from mesenteric ischemia, MI, and stroke. Periventricular lesions have been found on autopsy or incidentally on MRIs of both cocaine dependent and cocaine dependent but abstinent individuals like 10-30% of the time (I can't remember how many studies have been done, I think only like 3 or 4 that I know of).  You can check out UpToDate for the effects of cocaine use, but it doesn't have as much on abstinence and the like. Also unless you're in healthcare and subscribed you wouldn't really be able to access all of it.  Cocaine is the #2 reason for drug related hospitalization, right after alcohol. Heroin is hella bad, but quite a lot of the complications are associated with mode of administration (IV) like endocarditis, HCV, HIV, and the like, respiratory depression from heroin is also an acute concern, but it's not that common. Cocaine on the other hand has a lot of acute negative effects, and the drug on it's own, while not creating the same level of physical dependence as heroin, has a lot of long term harm associated directly with it, and then there's also the concerns associated with adulterants. Cocaine right at the Mexican border is like 60-70% pure (same with in Miami which is one of the hubs), once you get to the Northern United States it's less than 40% pure on average. In most of Europe that number hovers closer to purities of 30%ish. In contrast, over the past couple of decades the purity of heroin has actually gone up drastically. MDMA is a lot less dangerous than cocaine, in comparison.  If it sounds completely ridiculous, it's because you haven't read enough on the subject.

StackAdvice,3d8zjv,lastPharaoh37,4,Thu Jul 16 03:40:10 2015 UTC,"I want to offer you some hope from my own experience. During my junior year in high school I started experimenting with MDMA. My close friend was a dealer and for at least a year, maybe more, we would roll every weekend. sometimes both friday and saturday.  I would have like 15 close friends at my house and we would just have the greatest times.  I remember one time I took molly and something went terribly wrong and I was severely depressed for like 2 weeks after. I was positive I had done serious damage. The depression eventually lifted and over time I stopped rolling and managed to salvage my high school career and graduate in 2005. Even though I stopped rolling, I substituted that drug for a year long addiction to prescription painkillers.  I also messed w/ LSD and shrooms a few times in addition to smoking weed everyday.  So you can see why I've always been worried about brain damage from MDMA and other drug use. Before I knew about nootropics I was constantly researching supplements and techniques to improve brain health. I dabbled w/ college at a 2 year school after HS but my painkiller addiction severely hampered my ability to get anything done so I withdrew from classes and figured I was going to be stuck at some low skill job the rest of my life. BUT, after being generally sober for some time I decided to give it another go. Enrolled at Umass for mathematics BS. Got to my senior year with a fucking 4.0 gpa. relapsed w/ painkillers for 1/2 a year and lost my 4.0 but not by much. during my senior year I also decided to enroll in a 2nd major in computer science. FINALLY just graduated w/ a 3.84 GPA and w/  two papers published in CS peer-reviewed journals. yes I am 28 and just finished my undergraduate but the point is that I did it. Not only that but I constantly performed at a high level and I became more articulate and my memory became fucking insane. As long as I went to class and took notes then I really didn't even need to study for exams because it was just there when I needed it. I am not trying to say it all came easy because I put a lot of work into being smarter than everyone (I know I am not but I want to be).   Proof; that yellow star is for magna cum laude. It doesn't show GPA but hopefully you'll trust me that its 3.84;   fucking summa cum laude starts at 3.85 UNBELIEVABLY CLOSE  If MDMA causes brain damage then there is no doubt I would have caused some, but somehow my brain rewired itself to correct any damage and allow me to perform at a high level. I don't believe there is anything unique about me though - so if I was able to recover from MDMA and drug brain damage then anyone can. The only thing I can say is that I've always loved learning and even in the depth of my drug use I would be surfing wikipedia all night reading about topics that interested me. My curiosity drove me to explore advanced topics in the sciences and humanities so I was constantly using my brain.   EDIT: I don't think  you're overdoing the fish oil and antiox's. You should also consider megadosing vit C at 1000mgs/day. In addition, lions mane, niacin, noopept all increase BDNF. Also CDP choline increases the density of dopamine receptors; this is important for people w/ history of abusing drugs bcuz addiction is reward/pleasure.  I take all these in addition to some others."

After a few months (2 or 3), try out piracetam, 1-2g 3x/day. If I'm right, that should treat you very well.

StackAdvice,3d973n,stat30fbliss,3,Tue Jul 14 14:09:24 2015 UTC,"that scale is the best option for cheapest; go w/ that one. I understand you get caffeine from coffee but you might consider adding, say, dicaffeine malate as a supposedly smoother stimulant to combine w/ l-theanine than regular caffeine. I can attest to the smoothness of it, it's the only caffeine I use now aside from coffee. I drink coffee too but I find it helpful to have the powder when I need it. basically same price as reg caffeine.   As for the choline issue, I know that CDP choline increases both choline and uridine in the brain. So you get the benefits of both for the just the cost of CDP choline - although its more expensive than alpha gpc. uridine synergizes w/ fish oil so you might consider adding fish oil and switching alpha-gpc for cdp-choline to reap substantial benefits; powdercity provides sources describing these benefits. powdercity fish oil is really cheap too. I started w/ CDP-choline though so I can't personally speak to a comparison between the two."

Mostly, it's just practise and conscientious rewiring via focused effort on mentally difficult tasks. If it's challenging, then do it. Start to take pleasure in the simplest of things, like being able to do mental arithmetic quickly and accurately, or memorising digits of pi, or appreciating classical philosophical conundrums and developing your own perspective on them.

StackAdvice,3d4lbm,chtroy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:57:24 2015 UTC,"modafinil was the first nootropic I ever tried. Unfortunately I didn't discover nootropics until after I finished undergrad this past December but I really could have used it on those all night study sessions before an exam. I tried to be responsible but I was a double major and it was just the case that I didn't have time to finish studying until the freaking day before. So for those cases its legit but aside from that I prefer caffeine. As a student its a good idea to have some afinil on hand though - just incase! caffeine actually wakes me up whereas modafinil does something different in addition to guaranteeing you'll get a poor night's sleep unless you take it at 5am. It allows you to think clearly on minimal sleep. Imagine staying up all night studying for a discrete math exam, really abstract shit.. these are the situations that require modafinil. I loaded up on caffeine that day but my brain was fried from no sleep. Its true that if you're anxiety prone then stacking afinil and caffeine probably isn't the best idea but if I am overly tired that is exactly what I do. caffeine to wake me up and modafinil to promote clear thinking. You'll have to get a sense for how it affects you and go from there.  The rest of your stack looks good for sure. I've a lot of the same. You should dicaffeine malate though - its definitely a smoother stimulant. You can get it at powdercity.com. Another combo that I am really impressed w/ right now is coluracetam and oxiracetam.

If I am overly tired from studying all night for a final then afinil will make it easier to think in this state but won't really wake me up so I usually combine afinil w/ caffeine+theanine. if you are smart and study before hand then you prob don't need any afinils bcuz its not worth the struggle to sleep at night. although hydrafinil from ceretropic has much shorter half-life and is a viable alternative if you really want to try it out. I wouldn't blame you bcuz I did the same thing - just had to see what it was about.  rhodiola rosea  is great mood booster and improves awareness. ceretropic sublingual super rhodiola is best choice but powdercity rhodiola powder is effective and cheaper. I feel both just feel the super more. coluracetam is potent anxiolytic and really improves ability to think clearly in face of distractions. I've definitely noticed some visual effects like more vivid colors - it's quite unique. I just feel great after administering this racetam. however, I find it most effective when insufflated instead of oral; sublingual is more effective than oral too if insufflation is out of the question for you. the recommended dose is like 3 mg but I find that 15-20 mg is the sweet spot. a choline source if using racetams. the FAQ says you don't need to combine these but I respectfully disagree; the benefits from CDP choline alone justify its use. I use CDP choline because it increases choline and uridine. I've never taken a racetam w/out it so I can't speak to that but I imagine the experience would be dulled. it also helps w/ headaches.  centrophenoxine is excellent for increasing ability to focus and giving you a really clear mind noopept is stimulating and increases ability to focus  ashwagandha can melt anxiety away acutely, if needed, but I usually take it everyday regardless and if I am freaking out I'll re-dose. oxiracetam + coluracetam is quickly becoming a favorite combo of mine with oxiracetam oral and coluracetam insufflated or sublingual. the oxiracetam is stimulating so in combo w/ the anxiolytic properties of coluracetam the result is a quite remarkable. you have to try it to understand. I really want to try phenylpiracetam w/ coluracetam because the effect may be more pronounced.  I take bacopa and low dose aspirin for memory but I just started taking bacopa and the memory enhancement requires some time. The studies are pretty clear tho so I don't doubt its effectiveness at all.  I am also experimenting with super-dose (less than mega-dose but greater than regular-dose) fish oil omega 3 for anxiety. I am talking like 3000 mg of fish oil; this is only three 1000 mg capsules so its feasible. I also take triacetyluridine for its synergism w/ fish oil. Its hard to say if i've really noticed any anxiolytic properties of this combo but the other benefits are enough to continue; namely promoting NGF, increase spatial learning & memory, neuroprotective and neuro anti-inflammatory.   I take many other nootropics and supplements but the rest work silently for the most part. I really like lions mane and definitely recommend it. NAC is excellent in addition to agmatine, vit D, methylcobalamin (NOT cyanocobalamin), niacin. I am redoubling my efforts on meditation in attempt to reap the cognitive enhancing benefits, but haven't had any success yet.   EDIT: note about piperine"

StackAdvice,3d4p4t,lastPharaoh37,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:33:45 2015 UTC,caffeine and rhodiola to some extent but the tolerance is reversed extremely quickly - like a week off and its back to normal. Or you can just get a couple supplements that do the same thing and cycle. For example there is a new (i think?) compound related to caffeine called theacrine that can be cycled w/ regular caffeine to avoid tolerance of either. everything else can be taken long term but its probably not a bad idea to take a few days break from them just incase.
StackAdvice,3d4p4t,SuccessItself,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:43:41 2015 UTC,"Hi buddy. First, everyones brain is different and what might work for others, may not work so well for you.   Personally I can't tolerate Ashwagandha for some reason, but Bacopa works great for my acute anxiety. I'm not sure it's effective for chronic anxiety, but it's useful if I'm feeling extremely anxious about a certain event (I have moderate social anxiety aswell). Also, I'm not sure there's reports on Bacopa having an effect on short term memory, atleast not on short-term use (below 12 weeks) so what you're reporting might just be placebo/random occurance, but I might be wrong. Another thing I've seen recommended a lot for anxiety is Silexan Lavender (found on iHerb as CalmAid). There's also a great thread on Longecity about treating anxiety - just google: treating anxiety safely & effectively. Personally I'm also trying 18g of Inositol right now for anxiety, but it's still too early to report on the effectiveness.  For working memory, you might want to research Choline (or perhaps Mr. Happy's Stack), but I'm still too under-researched to be commenting too much on that.  For wakefulness/awareness I personally love Rhodiola rosea, just make sure it's standardized for salidrosides and not rosavins. Not really sure how it'd effect the racing thoughts, as I have very little of those myself, but for me personally it gives a nice mood & focus/energy lift. It also helps me cope better if under a lot of stress/fatigue (too little sleep for example). ALCAR might work for you aswell, but I can't comment too much on that yet. Also make sure you're getting proper amounts of fish (oils), vitamin D, and that your diet/exercise routine is balanced.  Hope that helped you a bit. Also take everything I say with a pinch of salt and remember to do your own research, as I'm still quite the novice myself! All the best!"

I think that adjusting these 4 things &  finding the proper supplements can change your life  for the better (& I mean much better).  This is my experience:   Cut out all added Sugars,  processed/preserved foods,  pork,  & fried foods.  I found eliminating grains helped a bunch. Eat fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs, nuts, & lots of cold water fish. Use coconut oil and flaxseed oil only (olive oil is OK but I don't prefer it). At least 10 minutes of simple calisthenics 1st thing in the morning. Meditation just before sleep will  change your life. start with a thankfulness journal or prayer... Take magnesium glycinate or Epsom salts baths just before meditation..  Also melatonin,  250-500 ug & holy basil extract or tincture at bedtime. Other supplements to consider might include sulbutiamine,  kanna (or Zembrin not sure how it works with a SSRI),  a racetam, citrulline malate, NAC (N-Acetyl Cystiene),  and TUDCA.

It could be that your SSRI is lowering your dopamine activity, e.g. through 5HT-2C overactivation. If this is the case, 5HT-2C should downregulate eventually, reducing the low motivation, but you might still need some more help in the dopamine area.  It sounds to me like you have a lot more research to do. Any therapist or psych will tell you that anxiety and depression are very frequently comorbid."

Bacognize is thought to be a pretty high quality source, so you shouldn't have any concerns.

Typically I would get something stuck in my head and was unable to stop thinking about that thing on the side for a day or two at a time.  I went to see a psychologist at the nearby university, explained my situation and answered a few questions.  He prescribed bupropion, as I said. It increases the amount of dopamine generated by the body.  It costs me about $20 every three months with my insurance.  I think its still only $20 a month without.    It calmed my mind a bit and let me think clearly.  I can still sleep very well but I don't feel constantly tired.  There was a side effect, aggression.  For the first month or so I could be angered very easily then that symptom went away and didn't come back. My doctor doesn't believe that bupropion can cause aggression even though others on reddit have experienced the same.  So i'm convinced it can.    It wasn't a wonder drug for me.  I still can't really multi-task and have some trouble concentrating but I'm far far better at paying attention than I was previously.

StackAdvice,3cy78p,Bigred6666,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:18:43 2015 UTC,Abilify is used as an add on for depression all the time. If you have diabetes it is not a good choice. It can cause weight gain but less likely at a low dose. It also just went generic this March. It is also an agonist of the receptor that the poster below talked about.

I wish its dopaminergic effects were way stronger, though. Rasagiline, selegiline, bromantane, or agomelatine might have been better choices.  You're right that NAC, ALA, and agmatine may help."

Nootropics (not including adderall) don't increase motivation but they certainly can decrease it by making you feel lethargic/depressed which doesnt necessarily impact motivation directly but if you feel like shit youre probably not going to get much done.

Check your multi to see if they have zinc or magnesium in it, I don't trust multis too much. If it does not, take 10mg zinc directly after every meal, and ~150mg of elemental magnesium about two hours after every meal. 300mg of Fish Oil is likely to have no effect whatsoever, I'd recommend a 1g pill, these are my personal favorite. Before bed, take 300-500 mcg of melatonin. How's your sleep cycle? Exercise cycle? Do you feel alive? What do you want from nootropics?   Also, why would you not take citicholine every day? Choline, Uridine, and Fish oil taken daily is very good for your health.   Many users feel using 800mg of Oxiracetam with 800mg Aniracetam gives a more powerful boost than using either on their own.   That dosage of Caffeine may not be your sweet spot. I prefer mine at 200 with 400mg of L-theanine. Also, don't take L-theanine to help you sleep, it is likely to give you a very restless and unenjoyable sleep."

I prefer allocating 9:30-6:30, but that's me.   Good job on the eggs. I fucking love eggs. Maybe take uridine on the days you don't take cdp?

Modafinil is good for wakefulness if you suffer from daytime sleepiness.  Bacopa is good for long term memory.

Have you ever tried supplementing bacopa or ashwagandha and gotten depression from it? If so, you might have been having side effects from too much serotonin, which is elevated by bacopa and ashwagandha.  Tianeptine lowers serotonin levels, via what they think might be the exact opposite pharmacodynamic of SSRIs. They think this might be one of the main ways that it relieves depression. Does your doctor know about your response to tianeptine when prescribing you an SSRI?  I don't mean to antagonize what you or your doctor is planning, but it might prove unpleasant for you. There is a chance that a lot of your relief from the tianeptine was due to the mu-opioid agonism--I don't know what doses you were working with. Still, it would be best to be careful and make sure the doctor understands how you have been responding to other monoaminergic drugs before you start the SSRI."

StackAdvice,3ctudv,SkepticalRealist,2,Fri Jul 10 23:26:16 2015 UTC,"I dont see anything that would directly interfere with the citalopram.  But one thing I like to strongly advise is for people to start an SSRI at the lowest possible dose and maintain on the lowest optimally effective dose, which I believe is quite often significantly lower than what is typically Rx'ed.  1) It reduces the likelihood and severity of side effects. 2) Your body and brain are less likely to get as physiologically dependent (and to obtain tolerance to beneficial effects). 3) It will be easier to come off one day, if/when you so choose.  So I'm not telling you what to do, but if it were me and I had to do over again (but w citalopram), I would start at 5mg max per day until its effects leveled out (apx. 3 to 4 weeks at least). Then if I felt like it could help more, I would increase to 5 or 10mg per day and see what that was like for up to a few weeks. And then either reduce dose and maintain or continue increasing as described until you reach an optimal overall dose. Be cognizant of changes that won't always be observable, such as effects on school or work, changes in social behavior, sexual side effects, etc.  My theory -- and supported by some of the literature as well as personal experience and anecdotes -- is that the average depressed person will benefit virtually just as much from 5-10 or maybe 20mg citalopram as she would from 20-40mg, except with greater side effects the higher the dose."

Also, exercising while initially starting SSRIs made me nauseous probably from too much Serotonin from heavy exercise combined with the medication so I'd go easy on aerobic exercise for 1 - 2 weeks.  My tendency to self-medicate with supplements stopped when I started taking Escitalopram 10mg probably due to my anxiety and depression been reduced. The only thing I'm still taking is Coffee. Also, I found it more convienient to take SSRIs at night since it was giving me slight brain fogs while it was in my system.  The SSRIs definitely helped reduce my flat mood and anxiety that I started developing after an severe side effect from Roaccutane. But it also reduced my motivation (made me not care about anything), gave me slight brain fogs and I didn't feel like myself. So I'm planning on going off of it.

StackAdvice,3cm3mn,striker_321,2,Thu Jul 9 14:59:36 2015 UTC,"I can't ignore the fact that I started getting worse immediately after I started Sulbutiamine.   Unless it isn't the cause, in which case you should ignore it and deal with the actual source of the problem.  I'm of similar mind to /u/striker_321; it sounds like the Remeron was just losing effect of it's own accord over the course of your sulbutiamine supplementation. I can almost guarantee you that sulbutiamine did not ""fry your brain"", especially if you weren't mixing it with recreational drugs, which can interact or mask the signs of incurring neural damage: if it was doing any damage, and you were relatively sober, you would have felt it.  It sounds like you have a problem with low serotonin. I think that you would do well to try bromantane, which is very serotonergic. I've tried Landasten pills and Ceretropic's powder and I have to say that Ceretropic makes a by-far superior product. The drug's dosage profile is great sublingually (I find it kicks in far too slow orally) and I didn't experience any loss of libido with the stuff.   Not to mention it makes exercise fun: your body just doesn't get tired! If you have depression, exercise is the last medication you should be skipping: prioritize it above everything. Its importance cannot be understated for your condition.  You might want to look into some naturally serotonergic herbs for tolerance breaks and the like, as they often don't have nearly the same tolerance profile as refined drugs. Ashwagandha, bacopa, and R. rosea are a few such drugs that help with stress and raise serotonin."

StackAdvice,3cgkrt,yup_yup_yup_yup_yup_,4,Tue Jul 7 19:15:20 2015 UTC,"YES! I am a former 113 lb scrawny skin and bones male. Over the past 9 months I have bulked up to 165 lbs. I naturally have an extremely tiny appetite and eating was always my biggest obstacle as well.   Here's what you're gonna want:  growth hormone releasing peptides: GHRP2 (moderate hunger) or GHRP6 (insane hunger) or Ibutamoren (MK-677)  Both options are ghrelin analogs and will make you hungry like nothing else. This is the real deal and I haven't found anything that comes close to how effective these are at increasing hunger.  I generally inject peptides (GHRP2 + CJC1295/no dac) 2-3x a day before meals and as an added bonus I get higher growth hormone release. When injecting peptides you get a MASSIVE hunger like nothing else. If you've ever smoked weed, it's not like that at all. It not only makes you crazy hungry it also triggers peristalsis and your gastric flow gets going. Smoking weed actually slows down digestion even though it makes you hungry, not good in the long term for guys like us.  Ibutamoren is oral so you don't have to inject, so some people are into that. Honestly using little insulin needles is quick easy and painless so the only big deal is the mental aspect the first time you do it. Ibutamoren also doesn't cause massive hunger increases but rather it passively increases overall hunger throughout the day. Perhaps not as effective for bulking, some don't notice the extra hunger, but some swear by it.  Also ibutamoren is MUCH more expensive. At it's cheapest you're looking at about $60 for a 40 day supply. Meanwhile I can get enough peptides + needles to last me 3-4 months for about $80."

StackAdvice,3cgkrt,glabius,0,Thu Jul 9 05:52:24 2015 UTC,"This is the answer here. You need to plan your food out to the calories you need, and follow it. If you're trying to lose weight or gain it. When building muscle a consistent sufficient surplus of calories is enough. 1lb of muscle is only like 100g of protein (400cals) whereas 1lb of fat is 3500 cals so in general let's say you're a 160lb male that needs 2100 calories a day to maintain weight. A consistent surplus of 2200-2300 calories a day is sufficient to build muscle, any more will probably spill over to fat.  I'd use a calculator, calculate TDEE. Plan your food to be 200 calories a day over TDEE. If you haven't gained weight in 2 weeks, up the calories another 200"

Just increasing your appetite is not a significant way to be successful in a workout regime that builds muscle. Even if your appetite is higher, it doesn't matter unless you're eating over TDEE. Regardless if you track your calories you can know you're eating over TDEE. There are drugs yes that can increase appetite. The safest one is cannabis (I find doesn't actually increase appetite but alleviates stomach discomfort and makes eating more comfortable - in my experience) Mk-677 will increase appetite, but it is a potent analogue and  as I said earlier it doesn't matter if your appetite is higher if you don't eat over TDEE, tracking and planning is still integral to eating on surplus and thus gaining muscle - any drug or nootropic that increase appetite needs to be accompanied with calorie tracking and planning"

I think that from recovering from not drinking using Kratom is not a bad choice. Sometimes it helps to have something else to do/use. I'd be wary about trading your alcohol addiction for Kratom though. I'd use Kratom sparingly for this reason.  Ashwaganda is a minor GABA-A Agonist that has some anxiety relieving effects. You may find that it is helpful for your alcohol use, and it has very minimal drawbacks (read: none). It can be taken every night and is extremely helpful for taking a little edge off.  What is the root of your drinking and why do you want to reduce it? Do you have high baseline anxiety? Is it because you just want to have fun? These are important questions if you want your stack to work, furthermore if you answer these questions for me I can further advise you on supplementing for treating your alcohol addiction."
StackAdvice,3cg4cr,glabius,2,Tue Jul 7 19:55:11 2015 UTC,"Preface: I drink every day, about 10+ units and have consistently tried to taper down. I'm currently tapering down and am actually succeeding in this. I've been taking this stack daily for nearly six months now since I'm well aware of the detriment my addiction has. I just wanted to see if anyone had any input or constructive criticism.   I run every other day for about 20 minutes. Trying to increase that, but I've a long way I go.   I've been able to control my kratom ingestion. I use it on occasions I know I wot be drinking very much or am going to have sex (it's wonderful for my libido).   Ashwagandha didn't do much for me. I took it for about a month and didn't notice any results except a prominent boost in libido which I didn't really find useful since I use kratom for that anyway. It didn't help mitigate withdrawals for me. I've heard good things about it among other users. I'm using bacopa right now, but I still haven't noticed any effects other than drowsiness, but I know it works best after a few weeks of use.  As for the root of my drinking: I'm a polysubstance addict. Alcohol is the cheapest and most available substance to me besides weed, which I don't like. Unfortunately alcohol is probably the worst daily substance, but I'm well aware of that hence using this stack."
StackAdvice,3cg4cr,shrillthrill,2,Tue Jul 7 20:29:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for getting back with a full reply.  It seems that your tapering is working for you, and that is awesome. I think in terms of your stack for dealing with that is quite decent. Things you might consider as a part of that to go with magnesium & fish oil (for general mental health) is: ALCAR, n-Acetyl tyrosine, and vitamin D.  If you're still at many units per day I don't see ashwaganda particularly having an effect. It'll be more useful if you aren't drinking alcohol at all.  In terms of exercise, it's good you have a routine started of every other day. Consistency is #1. I suggest pushing yourself slightly more each day. Some people prefer low intensity exercise for a longer time (30-60minutes) but high intensity exercise for 15-30 minutes is very similar to the longer period of time. Different people prefer one or the other, the best type of exercise is the one you can stick with and push yourself slightly more every time I recommend checking out /r/Bodyweightfitness for a more fulfilling way to workout that isn't just blah blah walk/run. Running can get really old and it's not for everyone, but if it is and you love it obviously keep doing it.  Polysubstance addict is somewhat of my area and I can understand that. Firstly, understanding that alcohol is the worst daily substance is paramount (besides maybe Xanax) - and that is good you have realized that.  Secondly it will help you to realize that optimal states of mind and feeling can be reached through substances, such as nootropics, and with careful cycling of more addictive substances. It is possible to feel the way you want to feel without these substances.  Additionally, it is possible to enjoy yourself without crippling yourself to the life of an addict. I think that having a desire for a higher quality future is paramount because being an alcoholic is not sustainable and you know that.  Lastly, have you ever experimented with shrooms or LSD to understand your roots a polyaddict?"
StackAdvice,3cg4cr,shrillthrill,2,Tue Jul 7 23:30:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. It made me feel like I can quit.   Running is extremely boring.

I have not tried it for reading or studying, but it has been great for my physically intensive job as well as just general household tasks and daily function.  I generally will do 2-4 sprays of 200mcg spray every day. Some days It is once a day at around 12, others it's twice.   Side effects I've discovered are fairly minimal.

Otherwise I sometimes feel a bit restless if I'm not doing anything and/or feeling bored. (seems like an adhd symptom but not really because my active focus is great).

It was Christmas Eve so I couldn't go to my doctor. They gave me pseudo and it got me through the next few days until I could get to my doctor. Turns out I had a bacterial infection in my bronchial tubes and was almost out of pseudo. I had to take so much of it just to breathe that my BP and HR were sky high. The doctor prescribed prednisone and z-pack antibiotic. The prednisone sure as hell got me breathing well, a lot better than the pseudoephedrine really.

I would highly recommend trying it, you can pick up a gram pretty cheap on most online nootropic vendors. I take 30mg in the mornings before work, and sometimes another 30mg before a night out. I find it has improved my general mentality too, like words come more naturally now and I feel better in social situations; able to make smart/witty comments without having to think about it. But the memory improvement stands out the most. Even after a heavy night of drinking I can still remember almost the whole night, where as before my memory would be shit the next day.

So I would highly recommend a 0.01g accuracy scale, can buy a cheap set on eBay though mine don't seem to start measuring until it hits 20mg or so, so it would be worth investing in a good set. As for the method of taking it, I haven't mixed it with water. I just take it straight sublingually. The first few times it's tricky because you will salivate a lot. Just keep as much saliva in your mouth as possible for 5-10 mins and swallow it. Eventually you won't produce as much saliva and it gets easier to take. It's worth mentioning I didn't notice any effects for 2 weeks or so. I was taking 40mg twice a day and felt some ""brain fog"", so I dropped way down to 20mg once a day.

I started practicing Mindfulness Meditation (Vipassana).  All you do is focus on the sensation of breath entering and leaving your body.  When you intentfully focus your mind on that autonomous action your mind simply doesn't over run you.  You don't need to sit and practice 30 minutes at a time.  I started with doing it whenever I wanted and worked up to sitting meditation.  Every time I breath deeply now it's like a physiological reset button and it puts me back in control of my mind. Thoughts have become volitional and they aren't running me, I'm running them.  Honestly I would recommend looking into it.  There are no mantras, there is no religion here, it's simply just taking control of your mind.  The buddhists call it rampant thoughts the 'monkey mind' and they consider it a mental illness.    Mindfulness is surprisingly easy to achieve and the more you do it the easier it becomes. It's not some mystical end point.  When you grasp it and you are able to put yourself into that state volitionally it then becomes a matter of willpower.   As for the nootropics have you considered Tianeptine?  It's worth a shot in my opinion.  It seems to help a lot of people. Also I always recommend a ketogenic diet.  I ended up losing 120lbs in 8 months (that I gained from bad behaviors after a car accident I was in).  There is tremendous nootropic benefits to eating a high fat no carb diet and it's something you really need to feel to understand.    Here is a pretty good reddit thread covering a ketogenic diet for nootropic purposes.  Good resources in there.   If you have any questions please feel free to ask!

For more specialized things, check out Ceretropic and New Mind. I can absolutely vouch for all 3 as I have ordered many times over the past year.   By the way, unless you are purchasing capsules, don't even think about taking a nootropic without getting a scale capable of measuring by .001 g (1 mg ) increments. Be careful not to accidentally get one that is .01 g (10 mg) increments. You will overdose and probably spontaneously combust.

Earlier this year it had gotten to the point where even though I haven't been anywhere near it in years, I still got hit with MASSIVE depersonalization more and more frequently, especially when I was trying to sleep or just wasn't actively trying to keep it at bay.  I made some changes in my life over the past few months, including quitting my job and actually working toward some stuff I enjoy doing and feel would be worthwhile, as well as getting back into eating properly and exercising again. I've had literally no episodes since then, and I had had this problem for like a decade previous.

StackAdvice,3brfly,madlax18,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:28:55 2015 UTC,"The general rule with any stack is always base it off of maximizing the performance of the strongest drug you are using. In this case, that would be Adderall.  First off, keep the Adderall dosage as low as you can and avoid taking in any vitamin C or caffeine during the day. I find that taurine is best for mediating the jitters of an amphetamine high (I presume that's what the L-theanine is for?). To help nullify the adderall and improve sleep quality, take 1g vitamin C and 15mg vinpocetine in the evening. The Vitamin C is serotonergic and acidifying, so it counteracts and nullifies the amphetamine in the body (I think there is another dynamic to this that I don't fully understand... I know Vit C and Addy both work through the glucose transporter and I'm thinking the C binds to Addy at the transporter [or something]...?), the vinpocetine lowers dopamine, which helps your boy normalize for sleep and slows tolerance development (I think? Not really got hard evidence for this, just common sense).  I would be careful mixing racetams with amphetamines. In my experience the combination is at high risk of incurring excitotoxicity. I had success with Vyvance (5mg), NASEMAXA (250µg), CDP-choline (500mg BID) and pramiracetam (500mg BID) for a good half-month cycle of hard cramming and feverish productivity. I'm not sure how well oxiracetam would compare: it's been too long since I used the stuff. Oxiracetam definitely threatens excitotoxicity in some situations that I've been in, although I was doing stupid things at the time :X"

StackAdvice,3boc81,pelo85,5,Tue Jun 30 20:47:06 2015 UTC,"Don't take them all at once. I get that it's tempting for sure, but don't use them as an actual stack for a while. You should use each supplement by itself for a few days to gauge the effects, with half a day or so in-between switching from one supplement to the next so you can re-establish your baseline (Of course, since you're going to use capsules, you can't exactly do that for the Alpha Brain ingredients and the caffeine/l-theanine. Still, take them separately from the rest of your capsules at first.) This way, you'll be able to see if you have an adverse reaction to any of your noots or if they're not very beneficial/more beneficial than you anticipated. Write down your feelings about each supplement as you're on it and how long you think the effects of each last, since you may remember things differently in hindsight.   Once you've tried them all separately, then you can produce your stack and your schedule for taking them according to how you've found the supplements to work with your bodily chemistry. For example, perhaps noopept doesn't last very long in your experience: you would want to separate if from your morning stack and save it for later in your day to make better use of its active period. Or maybe it turns out that you get enough choline in your diet and the Alpha-GPC doesn't do anything for you. Procedurally trying everything separately before combining them (or combining them sparingly, like testing to see if you do better on Aniracetam with or without the Alpha-GPC alongside it without any other supplements interfering) can save you money and frustration. Looks good to me. I won't give you my personal biases or advanced suggestions because it's your first time: once you know what you like/don't like/do well with/want more of with this order. you can branch out. This seems like a decent way to start. See the giant paragraph I typed up to start with. Don't think of this as a stack or take it as one to start: you've got to test them all separately before you start stacking. It's a small cost that pays off in the long run. Also, start off with minimum dosages: less is sometimes more, especially with capsules where you can't fine-tune your dose beyond doubling/tripling the minimum."

I've had excellent success with armodafinil for getting a lot of work done in a short period of time through intense focus, but it's for special situations rather than an everyday stack. Caffeine or another mild stimulant alongside your l-theanine is also helpful: you should get the extra energy and focus without getting too jittery or distracted.  Bacopa is definitely the best supplement for long-term memory: I've heard good things about Huperzine A if you ever have the chance to try it out, but it's not as pronounced as bacopa is."
StackAdvice,3boc81,multiusedrone,3,Wed Jul 1 16:46:34 2015 UTC,"You've bought a bunch of stimulant-like compounds because you feel tired, which makes sense, and it will probably work for awhile. There might be a switch somewhere in your brain stuck in the on position rather than the off position, however, producing a state of hyperarousal, but you still feel constantly tired because this state fucks with your slow-wave sleep.  Note the difference between excessive sleepiness and excessive tiredness. A normal, unmedicated (e.g. no caffeine) person who had been deprived of sufficient sleep for months or years on end would be constantly drifting off at work or school and crashing at 5 pm, not 5 am. If you gave that person a week-long vacation with no responsibilities to recuperate, with everything perfect with respect to sleep hygiene, they'd feel a lot better at the end of it - they'd say they felt ""refreshed"" and ""well-rested"". When I took a vacation like that, at the end I felt... exactly the same. I suspect you might be similar.  Histamine, glutamate, and dopamine abnormalities are associated with depression and restless legs syndrome:   Restless legs syndrome (RLS) appears to have some mechanism creating a ‘hyperarousal’ phenomenon in such a way that despite producing profound chronic sleep loss there is no significant daytime sleepiness (...) Thus it appears that histaminergic stimulation is needed to avoid RLS symptoms and that it has an abnormal regulation in RLS that may contribute to the hyperarousal observed with RLS. Histamine not only supports arousal but also modulates dopaminergic pathways. Abnormalities in the histaminergic system may, therefore, contribute not only to the hyperarousal but also to the development of the motor and sensory symptoms of RLS.    Cholinergic hyperactivity produces REM sleep dysregulation and is associated with depression and anxiety in mice.   Since the 1960s polysomnographic sleep research has demonstrated that besides disturbances of sleep continuity, depression is associated with altered sleep architecture, i.e., a decrease in slow wave sleep (SWS) production and disturbed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep regulation. Shortened REM latency (i.e., the interval between sleep onset and the occurrence of the first REM period), increased REM sleep duration and increased REM density (i.e., the frequency of rapid eye movements per REM period) have been considered as biological markers of depression which might predict relapse and recurrence. High risk studies including healthy relatives of patients with depression demonstrate that REM sleep alterations may precede the clinical expression of depression and may thus be useful in identifying subjects at high risk for the illness. Several models have been developed to explain REM sleep abnormalities in depression, like the cholinergic-aminergic imbalance model or chronobiologically inspired theories, which are reviewed in this overview.   I can't tell you how to fix this since I haven't fixed it in myself, but it's something to think about.  One more thing: if you sleep from 5am to 2pm you are at risk for a vitamin D deficiency. Get some blood tests if you can for deficiencies associated with fatigue/depression: magnesium, zinc, iron, vitamin D, testosterone, etc."
StackAdvice,3boc81,grimeMuted,2,Wed Jul 1 16:32:41 2015 UTC,"Hey pelo, I agree with multi. You won't be able to determine effects of the individual components of your stack if you start with them all at the same time. Although some nootropics can be synergistic and you won't know the full effect of the various components stacked together when testing them individually, by testing one at a time to start you can weed out any that give you negative affects.   Also I'm not familiar with alpha brain but it sounds like a premade 'stack' to me. I would personally opt for either doing a premade stack exclusively or your custom built one to start (after individual testing), rather than combining both. Taking the quantity over quality or 'shotgun' approach could b a dangerous game when the target is your brain..

StackAdvice,3bn560,pseupseudio,2,Tue Jun 30 22:21:28 2015 UTC,"It's true. Acid will cause you to lose a lot of your adderall through your urine. It's for this reason that people take tums, and, in more extreme cases, take about a tsp of baking soda about 30-40 minutes before taking their adderall. For XR, it is typical to take tums before you take your adderall, and then more tums about 3.5 hours after taking it, as the second half of the XR is said to break down and activate 4 hours after ingestion. Google ""potentiating"" adderall for thousands of conversations. Also, many adderall pamphlets or Rxs will tell you not to take any sort of antacid before or with the medication. Anyways, the more acidic foods and beverages you consume while on adderall, the less effective it will be."

What I can tell you though is that a friend recommended me to take noopept with aniracitam and a choline source instead of just noopept alone. Like you my friend didn't have any mind blowing experience with noopept. He explained the effects as very subtle although when mixed with aniracitam and choline source much more obvious.

StackAdvice,3bjsiu,stevonyx,0,Tue Jun 30 12:58:20 2015 UTC,"Looks good to me. There shouldn't be any contradictions with your stack (if there were, you would have probably felt it by now). In general, you should be wary of long-term use of substances that your body can build tolerance to.  I would refrain from using Sulbutiamine and Modafinil on the long term (especially Sulbutiamine). Not because they're potentially harmful, but because you'll build tolerance to them quite fast. Cycling them would be my obvious suggestion.  I'd probably also avoid using Melatonin for longer than a few weeks. It is a hormone, and your body will stop producing it naturally if you take it for too long. Not to mention that 3mg dosage is an overkill, unless it's a sustained release pill. From my understanding, human brain usually produces naturally only around 0.1-0.8mg per day, so 3mg instant release is way too much. You should take about 0.5mg 30-60 mins before bed, simply to fool your brain with an ""it's rest time,"" signal, so you can fall asleep easier. Unless you're also using it for its antioxidant properties, though I have no knowledge of how to use melatonin properly for that. Have in mind, I never had good experience with melatonin so I'm probably a bit biased.   I don't know how fast, but the human body should also build tolerance to the anti-anxiety mechanism of Ashwagandha, so if you feel it stopped working decently, you should cease taking it for a couple of weeks until your tolerance resets.   How much DHA/EPA does your fish oil have? Mr. Happy (the original ""founder"" of the Choline/DHA/Uridine stack) recommends using at least 700 DHA and 300 EPA for the stack to work properly."

I can't see the above poster because they deleted it, but it looks like they suggested something along the lines of a paleo or keto diet. Many, many people have success relieving brain fog when switching to a high fat diet. In my experience, when I eat grains (DEFINITELY if they were a bulk of my diet), I feel slow and foggy. You should give it a try. If you don't want to, that's your own prerogative. The debate is open how bad grains are for people in general, although there is a significant amount of evidence that they are really not that good, but certainly some experimentation won't hurt you.  Also, do more than kettle bells twice a week. Try to work out five times a week. Weights are good. Cardio is good too.

If you aren't eating a good quantity of raw food (or partially cooked meat and eggs), you aren't getting much. Most people in the U.S. are deficient, and deficiency will cause brain fog, impaired motor coordination, memory problems, and all sorts of other fun. Try 500-600mg/day to start (choline citrate/bitartrate are the cheapest).   You may also want to try adding 1g l-tyrosine in the morning and 500mg 5-htp at night (important to take them both as they share a rate limiting enzyme in their metabolic pathway, so long term use of one without the other can cause issues) to help support neurotransmitter production. 5-htp works on the same pathway as an SSRI (different method of action, though), so you should definitely make your doctor aware of that one."

StackAdvice,3beshc,taketheshro,2,Sun Jun 28 23:19:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is the case for most people.  As you go on with using substances, you will be able to tell a clear difference from one and another.  Caffeine took me a very long time to finally start to feel it.  I used to not drink caffeine too often but one day I decided (after only drinking caffeinated beverages about once to twice a year in small amounts like in soda) to drink a cup of black coffee.  The euphoria was so intense.  I put it above amphetamines easily.  I wanted to do everything and I felt so talkative and social.  It was amazing!  I began to research programming and made a huge book of just the basics of PHP in one night.  Then, I tried it the next day with no effect!  The euphoria had vanished completely and I only felt a bit focused.  Tolerance is fucked up with caffeine so that may be a reason why you are not feeling anything.  Amphetamines have less of a tolerance buildup in my opinion.  But im getting a bit off topic so what I would recommend is going for more pronounced substances for now.  The most basic and best one that you will see results from instantly is   Caffeine and L-theanine stack   It is very good and cheap.  You can buy a kilogram of caffeine for $15!  After that, if you want to explore more, here are some nootropics with pronounced effects   Eugeroics (Modafanil/Adrafanil) (These are more like stimulants and should be treated like stimulants rather than a supplement) Phenibut (Great for anxiety but should be treated more like a benzo than a supplements once again) Noopept (Very safe and is more on the safer side of nootropics.  Its not as pronounced as the others but I would say its pretty pronounced compared to the racetams) Methylphenidate (It is prescription only and is a stimulant but it seems to be getting a good reputation lately.  It still definitely is abuseable but I have had awesome success with it and it is less neurotoxic than amphetamines.  I was in before it was cool haha) Phenylpiracetam (Some people say it is pretty pronounced.  Look into it though as I have no personal experience with it)   Phenylpiracetam and noopept are more of the ""cognitive enhancer"" type of nootropics.  They seem to be helpful long term.  The others are more focus enhancers but some also have postivie effects on cognitive function.  Treat those as stimulants (excluding phenibut which is more of a benzo without strong mind dumbing effects)"

I think I'll invest in a milligram scale too, so I can start adequately dosing myself cover all of my bases.  I've tried 100mg phenylpiracetam before, and I wasn't able to feel any noticeable effects. I guess I could say that the resulting nootropics research that followed was quite productive, but I'm skeptical, considering that phenylpiracetam seems to be a very potent nootropic, which didn't seem very perceptible to me. If it's banned from the Olympics, then it's gotta be powerful to some extent. I think I'll just cycle it on heavy gym days with a higher dose and see what happens. I've heard that phenylpiracetam builds up tolerance quickly, so I'm not sure if that should be taken long-term either.  I'm just surprised that the ""racetam effect"", i.e. the enhanced sensory stimulation, seems to be a hit-or-miss with most people. I wonder if there's a mechanism behind the ""racetam effect"", and if so, if it's related to the racetam family's other cognitive-enhancing effects."

Like I said, not in a position to tell you that this is how it is, just possible food for thought.  Meditations: a good option is metta (loving-kindness) and related meditations on the Brahmaviharas (Buddhist ""divine abodes"" although if you read about them you'll see that they describe emotional states that are clearly a good idea for anyone to cultivate whether or not you have any sympathy with the background of other Buddhist beliefs).    http://www.mettainstitute.org/mettameditation.html  There's a closely related Tibetan practice called tonglen that's also helpful.  Might appeal to you more if you prefer visualizations:  http://old-shambhala.shambhala.org/teachers/pema/tonglen1.php  Both are usually described as if metta is what they're cultivating but they can do more.  Mudita (sympathetic joy) is another of the Brahmaviharas that's a focal point for some reading that might be specifically relevant to your situation:  http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/various/wheel170.html  Best to approach these with an open mind.  When you practice them, they're supposed to extend towards yourself too, and the space of all other people out there.

I'm a lot better off for it and so are the people I interact with.  These practices are also very pleasant to come back to.  There is some evidence that metta practices activate different parts of the brain on a fairly macroscopic scale than other kinds of meditation: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0040054.  It's been suggested that that may have some common elements with the experience of taking MDMA.  Can't confirm or deny and I don't advocate using black market drugs of unknown purity, but I can say that practicing metta and tonglen has gotten very pleasant over time.  It's reassuring to know I can come back to that pretty much whenever I'm reminded to.  The work is still being done though... I'm going to be consulting that last link too."

I wonder if the stereotypical Christian prayer before bedtime (""give thanks to grandma and grandpa and my teachers and my neighbors and my dogs..."") activates the same regions of the brain... Thanks again!"
StackAdvice,3bdp6q,Jack-o-Roses,2,Tue Jun 30 01:45:00 2015 UTC,"Sure, glad you liked it.  Mine are pretty short - usually probably 5 minutes or so.  I don't time it, just do it for as long as I feel like it.  My main meditative practice is mindfulness of breathing so this is just icing.  Both can exercise concentration in somewhat similar ways.  A stiller mind from other meditative practice can make it easier to get into metta and probably helps to go deeper; good metta practice can also help still your mind, although that's generally not described as one of the intentions you hold in mind while you're doing it, it just emerges naturally as you notice distractions and bring yourself back to what you were doing.  People do way longer though.  I've heard of people doing metta retreats where they spend literally all day for weeks or months practicing it.  Not the majority of people who practice it obviously but just to get some perspective.  You can probably benefit just from a short dip into it but you can practice as much as you feel it helps you.  I'm sure the prayer you mention has a lot in common.  If it gets that feeling to well up, it's basically working.  There are a few elements usually described as part of metta practice that I haven't seen mentioned in other contexts that might be useful to include in that kind of prayer though:   Extending the feeling to someone you feel neutral towards, someone you dislike or don't get along with, yourself and the totality of all beings is as much a part of the practice as reminding yourself of people you already feel great positive intentions for.  Keeping these other people in mind has a bunch of positive effects: it loosens the grip of negative emotions that you've built up towards certain people and makes it easier to feel (realistic, productive) positive emotions towards them and everyone else in the future.  It breaks down that sense of self/other, in-group/out-group that gets in the way of seeing peoples' true motivations, emotions, suffering, potential for greater understanding, etc.  It makes the negative emotions themselves seem less important, less a part of you and less a permanent state of affairs. The specific phrasing or intention matters.  ""Give thanks"" is good because gratitude doesn't need to involve much sense of owing or ownership or anything like that, you can just be grateful, feel good about your gratitude and the chain of goodwill that led to it, and that's it.  Nothing more to it.  ""May you take care of yourself easefully"" is another phrase I was taught that carries connotations that someone may or may not meet good fortune or be in your power to do something for or whatever, but you're still aligning yourself so that you're happy if they can just do what's in their own power to lessen their own suffering.   In the Buddhist context it can have an element of relinquishment that I imagine is compatible with a Christian view as well.  Maybe at some point it's worth wondering about whether it's God/karma/the universe/intentions/unknowable forces/whatever that guide the way things play out, but the point of metta or probably a prayer like you mention is that you can be blamelessly happy for wishing yourself and other people well while acknowledging that no one has complete control over any situation.  That kind of happiness is much more durable than happiness that depends on things going well."

StackAdvice,3bclu5,NootNooby,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:07:44 2015 UTC,"Hi, here's my experience. I had almost the same goals when I started. I'm an engineer student and I was taking too many espressos to go through my day, stress was killing me as well  so  I used to smoke weed at the end of the day. Ordered some Oxiracetam, CDP Choline, Noopept and obviously l-theanine. Noopept gives me like a boost on every sense; tasks to do are no more a problem, but I got a bit of anxiety when I had nothing to do. If you have very busy days this would be my choice. It's also said that it's  one of the safest nootropics out there. On the other hand, Oxiracetam just took my heart. It helps with focus and memory, but the effect I liked so much was the well-being feeling you begin to get. It improved my mood and thus everything that I had to do.   Both of these were taken with CDP Choline,l-theanine and espressos of course.  To sum up, I would advise you to try Oxi. I had surprising effects by taking it and I can't thank enough the person who told me the same things I'm saying to you. For those ""heavy"" days, Noopept would be fine but think well about what you want to achieve... would you prefer being pushed by Noopept or being happy while you do your tasks? Ask if you have any doubts ;)  PS. If you didn't do yet, read the nootropics beginner's guide"

Good luck!   How is your diet?  Do you exercise?  Do you meditate?  How's your sleep?  I think that adjusting these 4 things &  finding the proper supplements can change your life  for the better (& I mean much better).  This is my experience:   Cut out all added Sugars,  processed/preserved foods,  pork,  & fried foods.  I found eliminating grains helped a bunch. Eat fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs, nuts, & lots of cold water fish. Use coconut and flaxseed oil only. At least 10 minutes of simple calisthenics 1st thing in the morning. Meditation just before sleep will  change your life. start with a thankfulness journal entry or a prayer... Take magnesium glycinate or Epsom salts baths just before meditation..  Also melatonin,  250-500 ug & holy basil. Other supplements to consider might include sulbutiamine,  kanna (or Zembrin),  a racetam (remember that Yerkes-Dotson inverted U dose-response curve), citrulline malate, NAC,  and maybe TUDCA.  The last 3 are to help your body detox from a bad lifestyle choices."

StackAdvice,3bavg9,Debonaire_Death,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:51:17 2015 UTC,"CoQ10 and PQQ are great for making sure your mitochondria are healthy, and could help clear up lethargy.  As for repairing your brain, try to keep away from hard drugs (including nootropics) as much as possible until you feel like you are already doing better mentally--which can absolutely happen without using the drugs! I would go with ALCAR and Omega-3 fish oil as a base for your regimen; that helped me a ton when my reward centers got fried by an RC overdose. CDP-choline or Uridine Monophos. work for increasing dopamine sensitivity: I would try those out and see what helps for you--I find CDP-choline can cause a cholinergic depression if used without some sort of ACh uptake enhancer--like a racetam--but it might work for you. I did not find racetams to be helpful when I was recovering from my chemical TBI.  The most important changes are lifestyle-related. You need to be doggedly exercising every day that you can: get in stretching, cardio, and weights/bodyweight training in, all in the same day, if you can. If you keep doing it every day, the regularity of it will become an affirmation of your determination. Keep at it and you will see results!  If you haven't already, drop the alcohol. I know it's fun--I used to do it all the time. Things get so much better so much faster when you stay away from the stuff. If you have to use something, I would recommend marijuana, limited to one session or so per day in the evenings. Chronic cannabis use might actually help long-term with your OCD.  Also, cleaning up the diet cleans up the brain. Eating plenty of fiber and probiotics will populate your gut with bacteria that make it easier to lead a happy, healthy life (this can take awhile, but I used to have terrible problems with constipation when I was younger, but after a year of drinking kefir every day, I poop like I did when I was eight :D  ).  One other thing... you need to come to terms with the fact that you will never be exactly who you were before your addiction--hell, you probably aren't exactly who you were yesterday. For the longest time, I just wanted to be who I was before I OD'd, and I can tell you that sort of pursuit will never lead to happiness. Instead, overcome the struggle and it will make you stronger and give you a success by which you can redefine yourself. It is entirely possible and exercise and proper dieting is a big step in the right direction!"

This experience provides no evidence whatsoever that glucosamine can cause people to grow an inch.  You have as much reason for believing that pretty much any other thing that occurred during those 6 months caused you to grow.  Think about it.  Which is more likely: that study with the placebo controlled double blind trial of 40 people was wrong about how much growth glucosamine induces, or you're wrong about your causal attribution?  It's unlikely that you're both right."
StackAdvice,3b8llf,lodro,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:46:32 2015 UTC,"From the study you linked:   'The increase was not huge - it was between two and four millimetres - but this is a significant finding-Osteoarthritis affects an enormous number of people.  'Glucosamine could be helping to reverse the pressures caused by standing upright. It could also be regulating the production of cartilage components. Supplemenation may either increase the total body height of the average person or reduce the amount of normal spinal shrinkage during the day.'   So the effect was very, very small - 2 to 4 millimeters.  If that's the best scientific evidence for glucosamine induced height increase, then it seems extremely unlikely that more than a few millimiters of your change in height could have been caused by glucosamine."
StackAdvice,3b8llf,lodro,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:42:47 2015 UTC,"Only thing is, the people in the study took it for a far shorter time than I did."
StackAdvice,3b8llf,lodro,3,Sat Jun 27 06:02:50 2015 UTC,"At best, that could be an argument for further research to test whether a longer trial would produce more growth.  But lets do the math:  in the clinical trial, they took glucosamine or placebo for 2 months.  You took glucosamine for 6 months.  Your height increased by about 25mm.  Their height increased an average of 3mm.  Imagine if they had continued the trial for 4 more months.  You'd expect another 6mm, right?  So a total increase of 9mm on average.  Even if you assume the most favorable possible interpretation of the results, the effect found that study cannot possibly explain your experience.  At best - and this is an extreme stretch considering how weak and contradictory the results of that study are, and how unlikely a continuous, 6 month long growth induction by glucosamine is - it might explain about a third of your height change.  It's interesting to fantasize about, but I don't believe there is an actionable hypothesis to had that involves glucosamine inducing growth.  If you read the study itself, you'll see that their data are extremely weak: the two examiners doing the height measurements disagreed with each other throughout the study; their height measurements have an error range that's about as large as the reported effect.  The distribution of height changes among participants has a st_dev approximately equal to the reported mean.  For perspective:  this level of variation in height is easily accomplished by a wide variety of chiropractic interventions (e.g. a 2-second back crack).  Just adjusting the alignment of the spine is more than enough to induce a change in height of several mm.  There's a reason this is published in a chiropractic journal, and not a reputable scientific journal of physiology, developmental biology, etc.  Chiropractors are not scientists, and a chiropractic journal is not a source of scientific knowledge.  If this did gain publication in a scientific journal, it would be published as a preliminary trial; the only reasonable scientific conclusion to be drawn is that more research is warranted.  I'm not saying it's all woo woo or something - just trying to put this in perspective.  There is no scientific evidence that glucosamine induces growth in the sense you've imagined."

Right now I've just been on 4.8g per day of piracetam / tbsp lecithin for around 9 months, and I did noopept for 3 months in conjunction with my first 3 months on piracetam. I took a green tea diet pill to lose weight before.   I actually started with the 9.6g megadose of piracetam and didn't notice any issues, but it was definitely overkill. I mean ultimately you want gains but you also want to save money.   However, my bacopa, ALCAR and L-theanine are coming in soon. I think the key is consistency - not fanciness. Your stack looks solid."
StackAdvice,3b2ym1,gianttribble,2,Fri Jun 26 20:59:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks...so for the first day not much to report. I took 1g of only piracetam initially and felt something like a headrush within 20 minutes. It didn't last long and could have very well been a placebo. Tasted pretty nasty when I placed it on my tongue and washed it down with water. (Later on, I learn a better way to consume this without tasting it too much; simply hold water in your mouth, tilt your head back, pour the powder in your mouth and swallow. take another sip to remove any leftover taste.)     About two hours later I take another 1g piracetam only. Nothing. Maybe even felt a bit fatigued.  Another hour goes by before I decide to take another 1g piracetam but this time I took 500mg choline bitartrate with it. Felt slightly energetic and uplifted, but the feeling did not last long.  Two hours go by and decide to take NALT (350mg) and ALCAR (500mg). Music became a bit more lively but again, nothing dramatic and could just be a placebo.  Finally, took two (1g) doses of piracetam and another 500mg of choline bitartrate. Again, nothing really noteworthy to report as I write this.     So in total for the day (it's now 2 am) I've taken about 5g piracetam, 1g choline bitartrate, 350mg NALT and 500mg ALCAR.  A bit disappointing...I was expecting more of an effect, but understand it may take awhile to build up. I didn't try L-Theanine & Caffeine -- will throw that in the regimen starting tomorrow.  I'll continue this for a week and report back unless something dramatic happens. Also I probably will reduce the piracetam dosage to 1g a day instead, as I didn't feel any different with 5g and it will last longer this way."

StackAdvice,3b258m,JakeNotCliff,2,Thu Jun 25 21:30:36 2015 UTC,"Look into Mindfulness Meditation (Vipassanna).  It's not so much about 'listening' to the sound of your breath but focusing your mind on the sensation of breath entering and leaving your body (either through your nostrils or through your mouth).  When focusing your mind on an autonomous physiological action then your mind clears away any intrusive thoughts.  About 10 years ago I used to have persistent earworms of any music that I had been listening to a lot.  My thoughts were not in my control, it was as if someone was changing the channels in my head and I had such a hard time dealing with that until I started practicing Mindfulness Meditation.  You don't need to sit down for it either, I did most of my practice when I was walking places but now as soon as I volitionally inhale, the sensation clears my mind.

I haven't noticed other things making my jerks worse. Alcohol and other sedatives reduce them. Stimulants (aside nicotine when it hits too hard like smoking cigs) seem to have no effect.  However be careful with racetams if you're prone to real seizures because when you take a break from them the symptoms are worsened a little. With constant use it shouldn't be problem though."
StackAdvice,3ayfoa,NOOonly,3,Wed Jun 24 14:39:17 2015 UTC,"For pharmacological options, naltrexone comes to mind. Many dissociative disorders are caused by overstimulation of the opioid receptors. Antagonizing them may be what you're looking for. Naltrexone is indicated for many dissociative disorders.  As for supplements: anything that makes you more relaxed through non-opioid-receptor mechanisms might help. Magnesium bisglycinate, melatonin, taurine, myo-inositol, etc.  However, DID is usually a result of some sort of prolonged stress or trauma. You might be able to ""switch it off,"" so to speak, with tons of pills and supplements, but nothing will be a sure-fire way of reconciling your memories other than catharsis and therapy. Also keep in mind that with many people with DID, full integration of memories isn't possible, but memory reconciliation is - in other words, you might never be ""whole"" again, but that doesn't mean you'll be ""disordered.""   According to a friend of mine with this condition, the number one thing to do to start healing is to not fight your condition or be ashamed of it. The same could be said of any traumatic condition (PTSD et al), but this is especially true in DID. You may eventually be able to get to a place where you're not having blackouts of memory or experience anymore. They also tried all the go-to meds for dissociation (SSRIs, naltrexone, antipsychotics) and it left them worse off than when they started, so there's a n=1 for you.  I used to be one of those people who didn't believe in DID, until I met someone who had it. I had this concept in my head of a ""DID sufferer"" as some kind of histrionic, narcissistic fool who just wanted attention, but my friend isn't like that at all. Given my experiences with PTSD, I can see how if someone was pushed further than I was, their personality wouldn't be able to handle it and they might end up in that state. The brain can do some pretty scary things. Either way, I hope I've been helpful, and good luck."

StackAdvice,3aw944,Dicearx,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:07:03 2015 UTC,have you tried this stack out yet? im really curious as to how phenibut and and amph mix feels like
StackAdvice,3aw944,OracleBell,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:34:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, I understand the purpose and the idea that only once a week is definitely safer than daily, but most of these are only going to potentiate your amph for that one day (two, max).  It's not as if you can take this stack on a Monday and see potentiating effects throughout the week.  And you are fucking with your neurotransmitters to an extreme - literally upregulating every major one (sometimes multiple times over).  I'm just going to go over the drugs on your list with which I am familiar.  I'm going to ignore creatine, Mg, RLA, Theanine, and Ubiquinol because those are probably mostly fine.  More or less three different racetams are all going to be choline agonists.  Phenibut acts on GABA.  Agmatine works on serotonin.  Memantine upregulates glutamate.  AGPC is also going to act on choline.  Uridine is probably fine, but it can potentiate any uppers...and you will be on a few.  EDIT: Please ignore this paragraph, I had my drugs confused because I was first drunk then hungover.  300mg sulbutiamine...wow.  You know that sulbutiamine partially breaks down into amphetamine, right? So by taking this much, you'll be taking amph on top of amph.  Sulbutiamine also builds up in your system, so just taking this much once a week might not have the effects you'd want from it.  It also blocks MAO, which is actually going to be the main component in this stack that potentiates your amph.  It is also a dopamine agonist.  By my count, including your unnamed amph, we have two dopamine agonists, a glutamate, a GABA, a serotonin, and four choline-based nootropics.  This is a combination of uppers and downers and you also add in supplements to counteract their toxicity (ALCAR, baking soda, Mg, vitamin C, melatonin, CoQ10), which kind of defeats the purpose of nootropics to begin with.  I know that you have probably put a lot of time and money into this stack, but please, please, please exercise caution, this is just a lot of supplementation for the body to handle, even at just once a week."
StackAdvice,3aw944,Dicearx,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:42:22 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of not including the phenibut but a friend of mine takes adderall with a little r.c. benzo and even though it seems contradicting, he expressed a beautiful synergy, so I thought I can maybe reproduce this. But the purpose of my stack is for studying and the effects he described is not what I need out of this stack.   The amphetamine I will be using is very mild (think effects just above coffee) and my goal is to potentiate it. Sulbutiamine and amphetamine  The sulbutiamine is known to synergise with adderall so I am using it to that effect with my ""coffee on steroids""  Does sulbutiamine block maos? Do you have a source by chance?  Can you elaborate on the supplements defeating the purpose of the  nootropics?   The supplements are not necessary for me because the amph. I am using is known for its low toxicity and with the potentiation, I would be using a very minimal amount. Baking soda is for absorption.   Don't need the memantine since I would not have any visible tolerance. But if I ever need to use the stack in succession, it will be quite helpful.  Edited my post. Any opinions? Is it worse?"
StackAdvice,3aw944,Dicearx,2,Wed Jun 24 12:40:08 2015 UTC,"My advice is always to start minimal and add to your stack over time.  That would definitely be my suggestion here.  Start without the phenibut and memantine and see how things go.  Really, start with as little as possible and every week add something new in and take note of the effects.  I love adderall and aniracetam. So that might be a good starting point. AGPC and sulbutiamine would be fine to add to that as well.  The ani and sulb might make a good combo since they are both fat soluble.  I would start with that as well as some of the minerals/vitamins you have on the list.  Then each week, add something new to the stack and see how it works together with everything.  But I definitely wouldn't just jump in with that giant stack.  Especially since (and I'm making assumptions here, for which I apologize) it's summer and your class load is probably light-ish and you're young, so you have plenty of time to tweak a stack.  Save phenibut, agmatine, and memantine for last as those act on different neurotransmitters and you should probably avoid upregulating everything at once.  Here, some comeuppance: I apologize profusely for my mix up - I read sulbutiamine as selegiline.  Which is why I was flabbergasted that you would take 300mg (because 1mg is a typical nootropic dose, whereas 5-25ish mg is a standard Parkinsons dose).  Selegiline is an MAOi, not sulbutiamine.  Personally, sulbutiamine never did much for me, so I won't speak too much more on that aside from that I'm very embarrassed for the mixup (and will also edit my original post for future generations who may happen upon this thread).  But you could try selegiline!  Especially if this mystery amphetamine is as light as you claim.  What I meant by the supplements defeating the purpose of nootropics is that technically the definition of a nootropic is a non-toxic supplement.  So to be taking a stack which includes supplements that counteract toxicity, you're out of the realm of nootropics at that point.  Not a huge deal, not many of us stick solely to the rigid definition of a noot - just something to be aware of.

I have a demanding job in software development, which I am only at junior level, so I was looking for something to help with memory and motivation. Noopept seems like the full package though. I find it has made me more relaxed in social situations, words seem to come naturally without having to think about it too much. But the memory enhancement is the big one for me, I can even remember most of the night after a heavy drinking session - where as I used to have no memory at all after a big night."

Omega 3 (fish oil)  Curcubrain (Curcumin Longvida): very bioavailable version of curcumin that easily passes the Blood-Brain-Barrier.

Interestingly, much like Ibuprofen, Curcumin is a weak COX-2 inhibitor that is said to lessen the intoxicating effects of cannabis.   CDP-Choline: I prefer this to Alpha GPC because of the mild stimulating effects. It's an easy way to eliminate any mental fatigue for work that requires much thinking. Goes great with noopept, piracetam, and aniracetam.  Rhodiola: A natural stimulating effect that leaves me with a bit of endurance throughout the day. A bit of a lasting synergism with morning coffee.  Coffee (of course)  Super B12 (Ceretropic): With the bit of Methyl B12 in the multivitamin I didn't think I needed this but after ordering it and trying I can say it is very effective in sustaining natural energy and mood throughout the day.

Also, I would avoid using cacao nibs (which contain theobromine, another MAOI) in combination with so many other MAOIs.  With CDP-choline, the uridine production is mediated by your body; this seems to work much better for me.

I generally use phenibut once or twice a week to help with social anxiety when I go out with friends. I usually take 1.5 grams in the morning before eating and then evaluate how I feel about 3 hours before I go out and add .5 to 1 gram at that point if needed. High doses like this should be limited to 1 or 2 times a week as tolerance and dependence can build quickly. Take caution while consuming alcohol along side phenibut."

Also consider taking a choline supplement since there's plenty of support out there that acetylcholine aids in REM.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine  Lastly, beware many OTC sleep aids - many use antihistamines such as Diphenhydramine and Doxylamine which are anticholinergic which interferes with good REM cycles."
StackAdvice,3aez39,ziniclx,2,Fri Jun 19 19:40:51 2015 UTC,"For some people - mostly, I think, a subset of major depressives - it's the other way around. They have elevated acetylcholine activity and low dopamine activity. Acetylcholine has opponent interactions with dopamine and noradrenaline.  This neurochemical state disinhibits REM sleep, making your sleep cycles shorter so that you get less slow wave sleep in comparison to REM and light sleep. I have a hunch that my depression, anxiety, fatigue, apathy, anhedonia, sleep onset insomnia, deficient restorative sleep, and restless legs syndrome can be partly explained by this imbalance.  Doxylamine actually has positive effects on my sleep cycles, but it is complicated by the fact that strong histamine antagonism disrupts the histamine system's regulation of dopamine, exacerbating restless legs. DPH is such a strong antihistamine that the RLS overwhelms any anticholinergic effects... it's torture. If, unlike me, you react well to antihistamines, look into hydroxyzine and low dose Seroquel, which both have clinically negligible anticholinergic effects.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23391633  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23334071  http://www.eurlssg.org/downloads/abstract_allen_12-08.pdf"

StackAdvice,3a7i6d,chrizpyz,3,Wed Jun 17 20:57:01 2015 UTC,I would do a quick taper. It will take 2 to 3 days for the withdrawal symptoms to start . I find that taking a low dose 2 to 3 times a day helps the most. Do 250mg 3x a day and lower from there. The worst symptoms I get were insomnia and a feeling of dumb like it was hard to think. When I was on zoloft the withdrawal symptoms were not nearly as bad. Phenibut withdrawal is way easier than benzo withdrawal imo.
StackAdvice,3a7i6d,Morfn,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:23:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input. I took 750mg a few hours before I normally sleep. Will drop to 500mg tomorrow. Hopefully after doing opiate withdraw from gram of heroin a day it won't be so bad.
StackAdvice,3a7i6d,undercovermushroom,3,Thu Jun 18 04:27:52 2015 UTC,"No, it won't be bad at all compared to opioid withdrawal.  You're likely to feel more withdrawal from the Xanax than the phenibut.    I used to dose about 4g phenibut a day for a month or 2, then drop down over a week and hardly feel any withdrawal apart from some nervous tension.  Just keep doing what you're doing, 750mg a few days, then 500 a few, then 250 a few.  The main danger for seizure is coming off multiple GABAergics at once, so be careful there.  I would focus on cutting the Xanax first, then the phenibut, then the lyrica.  Well done getting off heroin too man."
StackAdvice,3a7i6d,undercovermushroom,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:36:53 2015 UTC,"That's great to hear man. I hear you on the Xanax, I've dealt with that  in the passed, and even that withdraw is a cake walk compared to heroin. I've made sure to limit by dosages just for sleep purposes over the passed week only, and did not take any yesterday. That sounds like a good plan - I'll be tapering the lyrica in a similar fashion, alongside the phenibut. I think be fine as long as I'm able to get some sort of sleep, which has always been the longest lasting effect with the opiate withdraw. I think I might talk to my Dr. about prescribing a short term dosage of trazadone or even low dose seroquel (as im aware both work in different ways than GABA) to help me get through getting off everything else."

Pharmacology of article  Hydroxyzine:       Hydroxyzine's predominant mechanism of action is as a potent H1 receptor inverse agonist (Ki = 2 nM).     Unlike many other first-generation antihistamines, it has very low affinity for the mACh receptors (Ki = >10,000 nM),      and in accordance, has a low propensity for producing anticholinergic side effects.    In addition to its antihistamine activity, hydroxyzine has also been shown to act as a 5-HT2A (Ki = ~50 nM), D2 (Ki = 378 nM), and α1-adrenergic (Ki = ~300 nM) receptor antagonist.    The antiserotonergic effects of hydroxyzine likely underlie its usefulness as an anxiolytic,  as other antihistamines without such properties have not been found to be effective in the treatment of anxiety.

It has a very short half-life, can put you to sleep quickly, and has two very unique features that enable you get away with less sleep and even have increased wakefulness afterward; GABABr agonism and GHBr agonism. GABAb receptor agonism prolongs the duration of deep sleep, which contributes to, at least in the short run, needing less sleep overall. Post GHB receptor agonism results in a surge of glutamate and has other far-reaching and strange effects on dopaminergic and orexinergic receptors all of which ultimately lead to increased wakefulness.  However, it would not be sustainable for daily use. Even for narcoleptics it is not sustainable.  A low dose could feasibly be used for a nice long 2 hour nap in deep sleep.

Personally, I'd go with the small doses of the adaptogens (rhodiola & panax) along with the ALCAR to begin. That's my basic stack for school stuff. From there, the caffeine & theanine I'd try after a few days when you've got something big to do then keep these for periodic use to avoid tolerance.   See how you feel after a week or so then consider the others. Bacopa takes a while to build up, and I felt kinda gummed up on it myself, but there's memory benefits some people claim. Never found much with ashwaganda (but that's with taking the adaptogens at the same time).  StJW has more to do with mood than attention, as I understand it.

StackAdvice,3a3gwr,Debonaire_Death,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:02:06 2015 UTC,"This guide has proven valuable to me for maximizing my dexamphatemine effectiveness.  As for safety, here's a guide for that.   My personal recommendations are as follows:  Always titrate from a very low dose and stay on that dose until it has lost effectiveness. I find that I can get by just fine starting on 5mg/day of Vyvance (so about 3mg/day BID of Adderall) and not see a notable drop in motivation for over a week, and at 5mg the appetite suppression is barely noticeable.  I would never recommend taking more than twice the minimal effective dose that you experience, and avoid cycles of longer than 2 months without significant breaks. If your demands on performance don't permit taking breaks, don't start; I've had friends get trapped in deleterious amphetamine use when side effects began to surface but they were unable to risk the productivity loss of stopping.  As for supplements, avoid Vitamin C during the day and then take a large dose (I take around 1g oral or 500mg sublingual) of vitamin C with dinner. This will dramatically nullify the effects of the amphetamine and allow you more restful sleep. Vitamin C also plays a factor in endothelial vasodilation, which is compromised somewhat by amphetamine use.  I also recommend taurine for the heart, as well as some CoQ10 for blood pressure and biochemical energy."

Try writing a paragraph or so with as many of the words you're trying to learn as possible, but make them make sense. In this way, it will be ""like math"" in the sense that you'll be actually using the words. Words aren't something that you simply memorise and forget.

More so with extracts/raw/high % cocoa chocolate.  blueberry extract:  why not share some fresh or frozen blueberries?  curcumin: probably fine to add small amounts to cooking to distribute across a meal, but I don't see much sense in supplementation and possible risk for the same reason as cocoa.    exercise: yes! but think of a variety of fun and social physical activities.  bacopa: http://examine.com/supplements/Bacopa+monnieri/#summary3-13  maca: what would the goal be here?  maca is suggested for arousal...  tianeptine/NSI-189: nope. pretty sure people would want to take your kids away if you tried to medicate a 4-5yo proactively with this.   It seems that depression's gonna be in this kid's blood, looking at the wife and I, and all 4 of our parents.   I'd work on being less pessimistic.  It might unconsciously influence your behaviour.  Look at CBT if you think it could be an issue.  lions mane: evidence only slightly supports elderly people using it.  avoid.   Maybe once they turn 16?   Wait and re-evaluate the science at that point in time.   Is this even moral   The more you stick to food, physical activity and supporting normal developmental stuff the better.   Of course whether or not they want to take the powders I buy them is completely up to them   It's not though, since you're in a position of trust/power/authority to decide what's safe or not.   Who am I to say they can't just take gummy multivitamins like every other kid in the country?   If they're not necessary and basically candy that might not be helpful."

SJW should only be used if it's absolutely needed because it can make kids susceptible to sunburn and probably needs to be tapered on and off like any other SSRI.

But it's pretty remarkable and worth using for special occasions.   Tianeptine provides moderate anxiety relief, but it really depends on the root cause of your anxiety. Worth trying, tolerance may be a thing but some take it daily.   I can't speak to Bromantane because I haven't tried it but being a stimulant it likely has both anxiety reducing and inducing effects, depending on your temperament and mood. Worth trying.

StackAdvice,39u50w,lodro,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:13:18 2015 UTC,"It's important to retain the same level of specificity as the evidence you are citing in this case.  You can't reasonably assume that a study lasting 2 weeks is applicable to continuous use for more than 2 weeks, for example - there is no clinical evidence in that entire document that supports the assertion that ibuprofen does not have deleterious effects on GI health when taken for long periods of time at OTC levels.  There is some epidemiological evidence for long-term GI safety presented, but most of it is not relevant to sustained use; either the study did not last long enough, or subjects using a decent dose chronically were rare.  They did present plenty of great evidence that you can take just about as much ibuprofen as you like for 10 days, or take a little bit occasionally forever, but I didn't see any clinical evidence, nor any strong epidemiological evidence, to support the notion that long-term high end OTC doses are safe.  Incidentally, that transcript reads like a gish-gallop attempting to establish that ibuprofen is safe for everybody any time forever cause its so great.  I wonder why...ohhh, it's because it is.  The document is an argument by Wyeth, the pharmaceutical company producing ibuprofen, which they presented to the FDA to argue their case for ibuprofen being the best thing ever.  That doesn't mean they're wrong, but it does, I think, establish that the conclusions of the paper should not be trusted naively - the evidence is what matters.  The evidence for long-term GI safety was not present."

This isn't about being for or against ibuprofen, to me; it's about knowing how to make an informed decision about how and whether to use ibuprofen.  I believe that ibuprofen is a useful short-term anti-inflammatory, and I also believe that its chronic use carries a substantial risk.

You don't want to overdo it with Vitamin D in particular - just take the recommended amount.

Your AMPA and NMDA receptors are likely all out of whack from the alcohol abuse, and taking anything that agonizes them might make your memory even worse, even though many of them are considered ""smart drugs.""*  Your best bet are restorative supplements, rather than any supplement that jacks you up. B12, VitD, Methylfolate are a good start. Consider adding in stuff like taurine, melatonin, and magnesium bisglycinate (or magnesium malate, but avoid the other forms like ""oxide"") for a good night's sleep. Sleep, relaxation, and coming to terms with your issues will be the biggest things to help you recover and get your memory back. Consider hitting up /r/meditation - even if you're secular/atheist/non-religious, they have good secular/non-religious resources, and it's been proven scientifically to help people with mental health issues like addiction.  Some of the memories you've lost very well might be lost forever, though, so have your focus be on restoring your memory for the present and future. You can make new, happier memories - that should be your goal right now. The stuff that comes back will come back when it does.  Creatine gave me consistent nightmares so if you have nightmares when trying it, then you know.  edit: * This includes things like the Racetams (piracetam, aniracetram, etc), which get thrown around a lot on /r/StackAdvice and /r/Nootropics.

Be sure that you have a vivid inventory of the drawbacks of drinking. I assure you I have screwed my life up far more than you have with drinking, and temptation still haunts me, on occasion.

StackAdvice,39jppa,redditerrible,3,Fri Jun 12 05:12:56 2015 UTC,"Piracetam's effects are in part predicated on the presence of aldosterone receptors.  Here is an old post I made on the subject, which links to posts older still discussing aldosterone.  Here's a simple flashlight test you can do to test aldosterone levels as described on stopthethyroidmadness.com:   This is called the Pupil test and primarily tests your levels of aldosterone, another adrenal hormone. You need to be in a darkened room with a mirror. From the side (not the front), shine a bright light like a flashlight or penlight towards your pupils and hold it for about a minute. Carefully observe the pupil. With healthy adrenals (and specifically, healthy levels of aldosterone), your pupils will constrict, and will stay small the entire time you shine the light from the side. In adrenal fatigue, the pupil will get small, but within 30 seconds, it will soon enlarge again or obviously flutter in it’s attempt to stay constricted. Why does this occur? Because adrenal insufficiency can also result in low aldosterone, which causes a lack of proper amounts of sodium and an abundance of potassium. This imbalance causes the sphincter muscles of your eye to be weak and to dilate in response to light.   Also, NSI-189 has consistently increased my racetam sensitivity after a few weeks of use. I have tried a cycle 4 times and every time coming back to racetams afterwards is amazing."

Kratom is wonderful with Bromantane as it gives a great moodlift with the stimulation. Noopept gave a good well rounded synergy to it as it usually gives me mental stimulation, focus and a mood lift. I imagine tianptine is ok to stack with it in small doses (or as needed) Bromantane is a dopamine and seratonin reuptake inhibitor so you wanna stay mild on the opioid agonists.

Even Adderall, which I take everyday, eventually stops giving you superpowers after a few weeks of use.

Just to let you know, this is all speculation. I'm no expert in any macrobiology or evolution so take everything with a grain of salt.  Perhaps energy conservation and it that without it maladaptive sexual behaviors would likely unfold and would have threatened immediate survival of our animal ancestors. This refractory period is not just exclusive to humans or even primates.  Although ""just being made"" to pass on genes sounds almost useless, it is remarkable for a species in the context of time. It allows for desirable traits and mutations, to be passed on offers likewise the ability to avoid further passing along undesirable ones and offers a means of preserving the species by avoiding sickly or diseased partners to mate with. There is a reason why there are not many examples of single-sexed, asexual-reproduction organisms; they do not have this way of self-correcting.

If this is simply a matter of being unfamiliar with your own ideas, and how they would interact with the ideas of others, then what you need isn't noopept; what you need is confidence. Noopept and other questionable nootropics might give you a short-term boost in confidence that may or may not be attributable to the placebo effect, but those are not reliable sources of confidence. In the event that the subjective effectiveness of the substance falls off, then you might be left with a feeling of impotence, which might further hinder your goal of being Johnny-On-The-Spot  I would also suggest joining or forming a discussion group on an unrelated subject where communication happens in person. Practice makes better. Simple as that.   I might be beating the drum of a conservative nootropic user, but I would advise caution when chasing sharp tools in the fog of ignorance.   I would stick with coffee, and if you feel unreasonably jittery after drinking a cup, then take a theanine capsule.

As an  licensed herbalist with personal experience (my Mom got Alzheimer's in her 40s) I can give you one simple tip to start with...nootropics are great but you may want to focus on mitigating any symptoms of depression and anxiety he might be experiencing.  You can throw lots of expensive nootropics at someone with memory loss without success if their mental faculties are exacerbated by depression and/or anxiety.    Also, doctors are not always specifically trained with herbal/supplement interactions....your pharmacist should be.  Do you know what meds he is on?  If not, who ever is his caregiver should work with a licensed medical professional such as an LAc, DC or ND who specializes in herbs and supplements."

I have been using caffeine for quite some time now. It helps me get out of bed and it provides focus during the long runs.  9:00 am = Bacopa + Ashwagandha (Himalaya brand) 1 each These are taken after breakfast. I've noticed that my stress levels have reduced a little, considering that I've been very stressed lately, and these herbs have helped me look for solutions rather than be brought down by problems.  Yes, Bacopa is for memory recall and not stress. I have been taking them together since I'm new to this and still experimenting. Tweaking the timing has helped me understand more of how they work.  10:00 am = Noopept Suddenly I am more talkative and social. It is easy to come up with ideas and to use data more effectively.   11:30 am = Modafinil 100 mg By this time I'll be studying. Post Moda, the game is on. I'm focussed. Not struggling through reading or math. What used to take a lot of patience and pain, flies by.   The effects last through out the day. Late afternoon I take Noopept again.

StackAdvice,38zqy8,shrillthrill,2,Mon Jun 8 05:16:36 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not an expert. But I'll name a few things I've been looking into and trying every now and than! But keep in mind I'm still totally a new comer! Could do your own research. Might get you started.  For Stimulants I will stay clear. I only know of a few.  I hear good things, and still working on establishing some experiences with Coluracetam. Just got a sublingual solution. Good for depression, mood, motivation, and maybe a little kick in energy? But I'll start taking it the recommended multiple times a day and see what happens. But shouldn't most likely take Alpha-GPC on it. Since Coluracetam is Choline Reuptake Enhancer. But again, I'm no expert. Beware though if you get some, last time I took the Coluracatam it raised my sex drive by a good amount. I was slumbering and lets say that I had some ""Interesting"" vivid dreams that felt a little real. Just a side note lol. But of course everyone is different. I've read of people talking about vivid colors on this as well.  I also find Tianeptine to give me a boost in energy and a great boost in mood. It's more geared to mood. A lot of people seem to experience mood lifts from that, me included. Energy though? Can make some people tried.  Noopept I guess can be hit or miss for some people. I at least found that it was quite nice. Found it helped with motivation, energy and what have you. That and depression and a good mood. Pretty cool actually... colors looked more vivid and so forth to some degree. But you're most likely gonna wanna take the Alpha GPC with it as it could give you a headache plus good combo. Seriously, give the Noopept a try.  Aniracetam is also pretty motivating. Could make you a little tired though. But a stimulant should make short work of that. Also tons of other great effects on mood and so forth such as vivid colors but I haven't experienced this first hand on this as I only took my first dose yesterday.  -So maybe something to replace the Adderall if anyone has any comment. -Noopept and some of that Alpha GPC.  -And you could try one or more of the following: Coluracetam, Aniracetam, or Tianeptine.  But I'm not really in a state of knowledge to go into really in-depth stack advice.   As for the Phenibut. I'm sure you've read the common things about it. Just as a side note. Took 3g of that stuff one time. Felt VERY drunk-like for a lot of the day. Seriously I was laughing my butt off and stumbling. Fun times. But, I advise not taking it everyday. As you said, you've read of some dangers. GABAergics can be pretty easy on the addiction wagon if you're not careful. Besides, there's a tolerance profile to it."
StackAdvice,38zqy8,Sulfinyl,2,Mon Jun 8 09:25:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your reply! While coluracetam does sound interesting, the last thing I want is an erection at work haha. I really only use nootropics at work.   However I shall look into anciracetam and tianeptine. And thank you for the concern on phenibut. I am very well aware and I plan on only using it once a week at most."
StackAdvice,38zqy8,Sulfinyl,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:39:52 2015 UTC,"No problem, buddy! I wouldn't say it would give an erection. In defense I was slumbering and cuddling with a girl I have sex with. But in the time between when I took it and that (6 hours?) I didn't have an erection or the biggest desire to have sex. It was just when I got there at 2 AM and was close to her the desire got very strong most likely helping on the whole vivd dream aspect. So I guess I wouldn't completely brush it off as a possibility.   Tianeptine is just an awesome anti-depressant class. Originally thought to be a Serotonin Reuptake Enhancer but it was found that it acts in a much different way. Good memory protective abilities as well. So, don't let the word anti-depressant get you down. I know the term turns me off. Given my experiences with SSRIs, SSNRIs, and newer atypical. Rest assured if the term turns you off, it acts MUCH differently! ;)   As for the Phenibut, hope I wasn't sounding antagonistic or negative in your abilities of research, or self control. I just always say that stuff when it comes to that class of drugs. Such as don't drink for awhile after taking it, addiction, intoxication on high doses, tolerance, and all that jazz. If you're looking for something else to replace it, might want to look into Fasoracetam. Works on GABA receptors like the Phenibut, but in a much different way. Acting as an upregulator (Making the receptor more sensitive to in this case GABA, or whatever you take that works on the receptor) as you take it over time. People with massive tolerance to Phenibut have reported taking the Faso. and it completely removing their tolerance. Most likely because it's making the receptor more sensitive. But it is a research chemical at the moment. So, no idea on interactions with the two. Might want to keep an eye on it as people take it more.   I know I said I wouldn't go much into stimulants to replace the Adderall. But in respect of Research Chemicals, 9-fluorenol might be one to keep an eye on in terms of reports. I have no idea as for daily use over long periods of time. But as more reports come in, and people decide to experiment, might show promise. Pretty much just like Modrafinil. But I will say from experience, it's pretty nice.        EDIT: Also, might want to invest in a scale. Just an FYI. Cheaper to buy bulk powder and you can control your dosage more. You might want to go up on the Noopept for example, but might have a hard time increasing it by say 5mg if you so desire. Dosage is one of the annoying things about this subject lol. Just thought I'd give a few more cents."

I took 1g of phenibut a few hours ago and I don't feel anything. Maybe it's not for me or maybe it is cause I ate around an hour after.  I shall try again next week!

StackAdvice,38wtq3,Jack-o-Roses,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:57:33 2015 UTC,"You guys are cute.  I started smoking at the age of 13, almost daily from 15 to 48, over 35 years of regular cannabis use.  Schizophrenia? No, never. Mental acuity? No appreciable decline over the aforementioned time frame. As a matter of fact, I'd argue that I'm sharper now than I was in my 20s.  I haven't fully stopped but I no longer smoke every day. Why? Two primary issues started to cause problems within in the last few years, acute anxiety and a complete inability to control my appetite after smoking. The latter I had fought for several years, the former only became a problem the last year but was the tipping point for my decision to drastically reduce the amount I smoked.   I traded regular cannabis use for exercise. Started eating healthy, no simple carbs/sugar, upped my protein and good fat intake. I've lost over 60 lbs and feel much better. The anxiety is gone and as long as I don't smoke for more than 2 days in a row, it's not a problem.  As it stands now I might smoke 2-3 days total out of a 2-3 month period.  Please do not allow one or two alarmist news articles that reference some agenda driven research studies to scare you. You will, more than likely, be fine. I have a number of friends, all in academic or science/engineering based fields that have smoked since their teens. None of these people show any signs of mental decline or schizophrenia. One of these guys was, before he retired, literally a rocket scientist. He still smokes every day and is sharp as a tack.  You are going to be ok.  A bit of advice on the supplements.   First, be careful with the melatonin. If you are able to get 8-9 hours of sleep without it, save the melatonin for the nights you have trouble falling asleep. Regular melatonin use can adversely affect the initial deep sleep period. If you do take it on a regular basis, try taking it after the initial 2-3 hours of deep sleep, before you go into REM. Most people that get a good 8-9 hours of sleep wake up for brief moment after the first 2-3 hours. Keep the melatonin tab near your bed and pop it under your tongue before drifting back to sleep.  Other supps I'd recommend are acetyl L-carnitine, ZMA, choline,   sulbutiamine and occasionally galantamine. But be careful, the ZMA, choline, galantamine and melatonin combo can cause some crazy dreams if all taken at night before or during your sleep period."

Decided to use the summer to figure out what works best for me. I'm very beginner and all of this stuff is very your mileage may vary, but what I've tried so far:  First stack ever, used for roughly 3 weeks daily, was oxiracetam, piracetam, alpha gpc, sulbutiamine, caffeine. Took this stack 3 times daily. Had amazing results, but wasn't what I was expecting. Greatly improved my mood, caused me to be less of an introvert on days off, improved energy, began working out first thing in the morning, just overall felt like it made me a better person. Wasn't placebo, as my girlfriend who would love nothing more than to tell me it's snake oil, felt very similar effects. Trust me, the last thing she wanted to do was admit it works. Gave the stack to several friends, all enjoyed it. Of course, mental clarity and reduced brain fog were there.   My current experimental stack consists of phenylpiracetam, noopept, choline bitartrate, caffeine, sulbutiamine. Definitely stimulating. At work, I'm incredibly on point and accurate. Pretty enjoyable as I'm a lethargic person, and it gets me rolling through 14 hour serving shifts with more energy to blow at the end of the night around 2am. It's more like something I could see being helpful for study sessions and days where I go to school in the morning then serve at night.   Of the two, the first made me feel like ""a better overall person"". Oxiracetam just made me feel happy. And it's cheaper.   I also tried adrafinil for about a week until I realized I hadn't researched enough about it. Too many risks and they're not worth it, at least I can't say I was floored by adrafinils effect.   I've recently added Rhodiola rosea (5% rosa/1% sali) 500mg once in the morning and once around 5pm. It seems to give me a calm energy addition and makes me less anxious.   All in all this delving into nootropics has been a blessing. I eat 3x more than before, I work out, and I'm just much more fun to be around, I can tell. All of my friends (the five or so who have served as my Guinea pigs with no expectations) love it. Take this with a grain of salt, YMMV, and I'm probably killing myself and don't even know it--who knows. =P"
StackAdvice,38wd9p,wezbrook,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:35:42 2015 UTC,"great explanation! just one clarification: i read that noopept is really strong compared to the racetam family. would you advise to start with racetam + choline and then, if needed, switch to your second stronger stack or they're quite different? in other words, you defined those as a ""well-being"" stack and a ""productivity"" stack, so would you advise to try both or pick one by the effects?"
StackAdvice,38wd9p,wezbrook,2,Mon Jun 8 14:54:02 2015 UTC,"I had the same goal in mind when choosing both stacks to be clear. It just turned out that my first stack provided benefits I didn't expect. I still had more energy, drive, and motivation than baseline off of the first one - - and if you do a bit of reading on oxi and piracetam, it's unlikely that you will necessarily find ""general feeling of well being"" as one of the most common side effects. These stacks tend to provide different results for each person. As a starter, my first stack is much better for getting your feet wet, although I'd say I didn't waste any time. Most first timers begin with piracetam, a choline source, and something like sulbutiamine or vincopetine. Caffeine and Theanine are obvious. I personally found caffeine alone to work better for me, honestly. It almost felt like the Theanine negated the caffeine. I still consider it a good supplement, it's just not for me, and I'm in the minority in this one. My second stack is nice but I'd call it more advanced, if there is such a thing. It's some of the stuff people ""graduate"" to once they've decided ""this nootropic stuff is for me"". So yes to answer your question I do find the two stacks quite different. First stack is akin to knocking on the door, you know somethings there, it's just a subtle knock. The second, when cycled, kicks the door in. You hardly have to look for subtle things it's improving. Further, many say that piracetam and noopet follow a U or bell shaped curve, the more consistently you take them, the more their effects are felt. Oxi is fine daily with no tolerance. Phenyl, people say shouldn't be a daily thing. I've taken it daily for a week and while I don't feel like superman as I did on day two, it's still working quite well for me. Sorry for the long post and if there's any other advice I can share, let me know."
StackAdvice,38wd9p,wezbrook,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:42:56 2015 UTC,"ok, I've taken oxi powder, noopept tablets, l-theanine powder and cdp-choline tablets.  I think I'm going to start with oxi+choline+theanine for few days and then noopept+choline+theanine to compare the effects. after that, when I will figure out what these do, I'll try to stack oxi and noopept. Any advice about how to take them? Full/empty stomach? How do you take the powder?"
StackAdvice,38wd9p,LeighmurBJJ,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:26:03 2015 UTC,"It's said that noopept works best after a meal or definitely with fish oil, but overall many are reporting best success with taking it sublingually. Not sure what noopept tablets you have but if they are able to be put under the tongue and dissolved, good. Oxi is water soluble and doesn't need food. Also, are you avoiding caffeine? Theanine on its own may mellow you out. Personally, I put all of my powders into small travel containers, dump it into my mouth, and chase it with water. You get used to the taste of certain things like sulbutiamine. Also, Oxi is one of the best tasting noots in my experience."

I also use adrafinil and thought you might like to hear another perspective on it. It seems to me as though a lot of people expect adrafinil/modafinil to help them study. They're drugs that are made to help narcolepsy patients; basically to stay awake (this is also according to a psychiatrist), NOT to help with studying. So I pretty much just take adrafinil whenever I'm really tired. I'll use it two days in a row and take 5 days off to avoid any health issues with it. Hope this helped some."

StackAdvice,38h3po,myliobatis,2,Thu Jun 4 08:02:20 2015 UTC,"Experimenting with nootropics when you have bipolar is like deciding to do car stunts when you have a flat tire--it's possible, and really cool if you pull it off, but more difficult and a mistake can cost a lot more to your well-being.  I've never been diagnosed but I have all of the symptoms and genetic indications of a bipolar disposition. Sometimes that can bite me while I'm experimenting with all of this stuff. Overall, though, I've learned enough about neurochemistry to have an idea of what is going wrong and fix it before it gets out of hand--tianeptine is an invaluable substance in instances of depression from monoaminergic surplus, for instance, such as when I'm experimenting with MAOIs or serotonergics (I have low-functioning MAO-A). I feel, at this point, that my experimentation with nootropics has transformed me into a better person  more capable of success on the terms I desire. I could just as easily fuck myself back up in a month or less, though, if I made the wrong choices.  Part of this comes down to whether you want to continue using recreational drugs,  as well. I think things would be much safer for me if I never wanted to have fun with my brain chemistry. As for your Rx drugs, Vyvance is a great drug in its own right and synergizes very smoothly with a large slice of the drug pie that we put our thumbs in around here. I have no firsthand experience with Pristiq, but that may give you more problems, as it is basically a modified form of hordenine. MAOIs can very easily cause problems when mixed with monoaminergics, and many of these cognitive enhancers have monoaminergic actions. Is the Pristiq helping you? Have SSRIs or other drugs that increase serotonin been helpful in the past? If not, you may have low MAO-A, like me, in which case serotonergics and MAOIs will mostly depress you and make your mood less rather than more stable."

Effexor did not help, though. Wellbutrin (NDRI) did not seem to help me.

I would recommend you look into tianeptine. It has no contraindications with amphetamines and can help a lot if you have an MAO-A deficiency, since it lowers serotonin without deprecating other monoamines. I would give an educated guess that the Pristiq isn't doing you any favors, but I am not a medical professional. I wouldn't recommend anyone who hasn't benefited from SSRIs to take a norepinephrine/serotonin reuptake inhibitor. If you really benefit from the norepinephrine it's giving you, you can always use a sympathomimetic like DMAA or something else that isn't serotonergic.  Also increases BDNF in the brain, which wouldn't hurt with better developing your ability to store long-term memories--mind you, it will mainly enhance memory through working synergistically with your own efforts to stimulate your mind: you'll need to apply yourself and learn things to glean real results (if fact, you pretty much always do for anything but an acute and fleeting boost with any of these drugs)."

Next, have your doctor lower the medicines you are taking (particularly the VyVanse) and get off of it if possible. Next best choice, the lowest dose possible. Everyone is different, and I am no doctor, but if you don't have diet, exercise, and sleep down a nootropic probably won't have much of a benefit. Thats my opinion. Hope it helps.

I don't take the vyvanse every single day. I often take days off and just sleep a ton. My worry with nootropics is it causing mania or psychotic symptoms. Things that mess with brain chemistry can exacerbate these issues. The only reason I can take vyvanse is because I have an antipsychotic to bring me down - too much uppers and I have psychotic symptoms and stop sleeping, even long after the uppers wear off...and usually stay manic/psychotic until I take antipsychotics to bring me down.

StackAdvice,38ha81,shrillthrill,2,Thu Jun 4 12:01:39 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm going to take a stab at this as I also was put on escitalopram for 9 months (for focus issues, didn't help at all as it had nothing to do with depression/anxiety), followed by d-amph, to ritalin, to concerta (slow release MPH), and finally adderall.  I've experimented A LOT with various supplements and medications; as such, keep in mind my findings are relevant to personal bodychemistry - YMMV.  A couple speculations, if you will:   If you're finding tyrosine supplementation helps, your brain fog can be related to an imbalance in neurotransmitters - this doesn't necessarily have anything to do with your thyroid. Keep in mind, amphetamine is an incredibly powerful stimulant, it burns through NT stores FAST; it would be a great oversight to underestimate how much it is using. How quickly you can restore it can vary between individuals... I myself do not seem to synthesize NT's quickly at all. As such, I have had incredible success with supplementing both choline and tyrosine prior to taking my amph (as well as during the come-down). As a test, upon coming down from your amph, try supplementing tyr+ACh; you will see just how big of a difference it makes. I literally don't have withdrawals if I restore my DA+ACh. In my post history, I have a rather long write up on why supplementing ACh with amph is a great idea. Another issue that you may be having is sleep issues. Even after coming down from amph, a lot of people have residual anxiety / jitters, and while you may fall asleep, it doesn't necessarily mean you are getting quality sleep. I would suggest Magnesium + melatonin to help with that. Additionally, the caffeine could be helping if you are indeed having sleep issues. How is your water+food intake? People severely under eat/drink enough food/liquids. It is VERY easy to become hypoglycemic due to not eating as the amph induced flight or fight response tends to decrease ghrelin (hunger hormone) activity. The lack of water, I'm sure, speaks for itself. Furthermore, depending on when you eat, amph can reduce absorption (as previously stated, due to GI tract activity being reduced) - so you may be absorbing a lot less tyr then you think. The last thing I would suggest noting - the NALT was coupled with caffeine, caffeine's stimulatory effects tend to potentiate amph, giving your amph dose a solid kick. Caffeine also tends to have a reasonably positive effect for those with ADHD (more so than the average population).   I could go on about this forever, but I think I've probably given you enough to think about.  Just my 2cents, hope this helps. Good luck!"

I'll have another look though.  I don't think the persistent brain fog I've experienced is caused by a lack of dopamine or norepinepherine, their production shouldn't be rate limited by tyrosine reserves as i regularly consume dairy and meat. That said I can't account for the rejuvenation achieved with a paltry 200mg of NALT. I should add that the NALT  ingested was from ceretropics caffeine/nalt solution and that the pharmacology of the constituents should be altered as they've apparently produced a salt of the two.  I've been brainfogged since coming off of escitalopram. I thought I'd sustained irreparable damage and that I would never regain my former mental acuity. However experiences with the NALT have changed my mind on this. If the brainfog has been caused by dexamphetamines the whole time, well my face will surely be pied. I'm going to go without dexamps for three weeks and see how I fare.

StackAdvice,38grvd,Mr_BenDover,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:50:34 2015 UTC,"At risk of sounding sarcastic, it depends on what type of shipping you selected.   Powder City ships same day only for orders received by 8AM or so. In other words, only orders from the following day get shipped any given day. On the day it ships, all that will happen is it will get taken to the postal distribution center (i.e., not going anywhere really). The postage time really starts the following day. So as an example, lets say you made a Powder City order at 1:00PM Wednesday and paid for priority mail. Since it was received after 8:00AM, Powder City won't take it to the post office until Thursday afternoon. The package won't leave the in-town postal facilities until  late Thursday night or Friday morning. Now depending on your distance, that package might make it to your city's post office by Friday late night. In that case, you will get your order sometime on Saturday between about 9:00AM and 5:00PM. However, if your package hasn't made it to your post office by Friday night, then it will get processed on Saturday. Then, you will get it delivered sometime between 9:00AM and 5:00PM on the following Monday.  At any time, you can use your tracking number to get a delivery date estimate. This is the best way to figure out how long it will take.   For reference purposes, the situation I described was my own. I ordered Wednesday and received Saturday by paying for priority mail. If I had used the basic postage option, it would probably have taken longer."

I've tried to cut them down to the minimum, but... I certainly believe that they have taken their toll with regard to cognitive decline...

StackAdvice,38g063,DoktorBuk,2,Wed Jun 3 23:37:13 2015 UTC,PEA is not a nootropic.  Pregnenolone isn't either? Kratom is not considered one either due to dependence problems: /r/quittingkratom
StackAdvice,38g063,shrillthrill,2,Thu Jun 4 01:25:36 2015 UTC,kratom is worrisome. If he stops the stack he's probably going to crash and feel depressed/headaches/brain fog. Mucuna Pruriens are also probably going to cause withdrawal problems (less than kratom) and dopamine receptor down regulation along with all the dopamine boosters. Uridine might help reverse the effects but I don't know that much about uridine.

If you want him to kick meth, modafinil is a valid alternative without the awful side effects.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3076899/  Modafinil is a drug which instead of being a stimulant is an ""alertness enhancer"". It causes the brain's neurons to secrete dopamine but it doesn't release into the synapse like with meth and get you high. However, that is only one mechanism of action and is theorized not to be a primary one.  It is used by fighter pilots in the us military in order to stay awake for 48+ hours with no cognitive deficits.  In many anecdotal experiences it is good for stimulant withdrawal because when you withdraw from stimulant use, you feel extremely unmotivated and drained for months at a time. Modafinil can give you that extra oomph that coffee can not provide which will allow you to continue functioning during withdrawal because otherwise getting out of bed is a daunting task and actually getting something productive done is impossible.  In my opinion, a theory about a ""dopamine deficiency"" sounds like a rationalization for using made by someone who knows enough about neurology to know what dopamine is but not enough about neurology to understand that there is no such thing as a ""dopamine deficiency"" when in reality dopamine does very different things in different parts of the brain.  If he had a real ""dopamine deficiency"" he would know it because his motor neurons would not be able to fire and he would be unable to move. An example of this is ALS.  If anything he has a lower concentration of dopamine receptor sites but meth will only make this worse and is likely to cause permanent damage.  My recommendation is to keep him in the dark about any permanent damage as in drug addicts this is used for a rationalization for continuation of use. ""I'm already an un-repairably broken person, might as well keep using"". Also mention modafinil as an alternative. It's a schedule 4 drug meaning that it has medical use cases with no potential for abuse.  Good luck!

It's entirely possible that a person could have a dopamine deficiency through mutations to MAO-B, or another enzyme that is producing some sort of serious catecholamine deficiency.  I'm not saying you aren't right in this situation; meth is a hell of a drug, but even the strong drugs can actually benefit certain chemical imbalances.

They can enhance or impair performance depending on personal factor and context. For instance if you're nervous and don't have ADD stimulants and make you way too focused for complex or insightful tasks. I would stick to sleep and nutrients.   Here are some nutrients to consider: * Creatine (this has to be started a week before at 20 grams per day) * L-tyrosine (5 grams)

The only one I could recommend for that is caffeine/L-theanine, and even that will rarely produce undesirable side effects (from zero tolerance to both, though, I find it worked amazingly well).  NASEMAXA and phenylpiracetam are both drugs that I find do a great job performing acutely and producing immediate results.

Of course, they are expensive and prescription-only.   Taking a psychostimulant like adderall once will not have any long-term adverse effects, so if you can get your hands on some, it will make you work quicker and more efficiently.   However some people get extreme anxiety from these drugs and the energy can be too much to handle, so get two pills (preferably an XR (extended release) version of really any stimulant) to familiarize yourself with its effects.

I would be cautious with the vinpocetine; it's pretty intense stuff. I haven't experimented with it in awhile: I was accidentally ingesting it as part of a complex years ago, but taking it by itself seemed to really make me at risk for headaches.  I really enjoy ALCAR with racetams. it seems to increase their BBB penetration and really kick them in good when taken in concert.  I haven't experimented extensively with sulbutiamine, but it worked wonders with making Noopept a force to be reckoned with, and I could see it doing the same for pramiracetam.  Just make sure you are taking a good dose of Alpha-GPC with the pramiracetam! Of all racetams, I find prami the most susceptible to choline headaches: there were times when I would have to keep a capsule of Alpha-GPC in my pocket for sublingual administration if a headache suddenly seized me (this was on 750mg oral)!  Ginkgo Biloba is a blood thinner: so is pramiracetam. Use caution mixing these! I've had good experiences taking both, though. Generally it's something to only really worry about with very high-dose piracetam or if other blood thinners are being taken for medical reasons.  L-theanine is one of those supplements that you have no idea how it will affect you until you try it. Fortunately, the worst you'll get is some bad lethargy. Just start with low doses and don't forget you can have an initial ""honeymoon phase"" if you stack it with stims, where you'll think it's evening out everything perfectly and then you get hit with bad lethargy the third day you take it. I use L-theanine in very low doses (like, around 50mg or less sublingual) to even out very stimulating stacks (like things that include Vyvance or phenylpiracetam) but besides that I use it for sleep--which it works wonderfully for at high (600-800mg) doses!

That includes serotonin agonists, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin precursors, SAM-e, MAO-A inhibitors, and unselective MAOIs.  Combining two serotonergics won't necessarily increase serotonin to dangerous levels. Many foods are mild reversible MAOIs, like nutmeg and turmeric for example. But be cautious.  Raising dopamine and noradrenaline too high usually isn't a huge issue unless you're bipolar or schizophrenic.  Look around for melatonin research. For long term use lower doses in the 0.2-1 mg range may be preferable. You could also try taking magnesium citrate or glycinate with it; it helps a lot of people with sleep and magnesium deficiencies are common.

Don't let the dollar signs fool you: piracetam is worth checking out! I'm a very high responder, though. Still, it's so cheap there's practically nothing to lose!  Also, you have to keep in mind that saying ""Oxiracetam is 10X stronger than Piracetam!"" is a hyped oversimplification meant to sell the more expensive powders. These are crude approximations overlooking the fact that each of these drugs is unique and has it's own characteristics.  You also might want to look into sulbutiamine.

I'm not a nootropic expert, but I've tried a lot of different things. High dose phenibut is great for my social anxiety and depression, but it's really a drug - I feel high. It's also addictive and can end up making me sleep all day. Tianeptine is the same, but with a very different feel to it.   Aniracetam seems to help me in a much milder, long-term-solution kind of way. I am experimenting with and without Alpha-GPC, but Cholinergics can make me feel really irritable sometimes. I think of the choline as 'food' for racetams. As long as I've taken enough aniracitam to use up the choline, I'm fine and it helps the aniracitam kind of ""clear up"" my head - but if there's too much choline in the mix I feel awful.   L-theanine is a nice one to help relax. It's good for stress and can help me go to sleep.   Nootropics aren't really a cure for serious mood disorders and mental illness, though. Some may help a bit, but it sounds like you need to find a good psychiatrist/therapist combo to help you get medicine. It's hella frustrating because they just want to try every antidepressant ever made, and for folks like us, most of them don't work or the side effects are far worse than the little help they do give. You just have to keep at it, and tell your doc that those types of meds aren't working. Keep on their asses until they find something that really does work - I'm not there yet, but I've read a lot of people's stories that were similar and they just kept working with the doctors until some weird combo worked out.

Potent anticholinergics tend to have similar effects... you could do the same with Benadryl or Datura seeds. The real difference is that ingesting legal anticholinergics is rather noticeable since they are less concentrated and taste awful.  Anticholinergic overdose produces acute anticholinergic syndrome which, judging from erowid, often results in (among the spiders, shadow people, and phantom cigarettes) extreme gullibility and memory loss. However, the memory loss is usually not total and not everyone reacts the same way so it's still a risky method of robbing someone.  I'm fascinated by the symptoms of normal people who take big DPH doses: they often closely resemble anxious/depressed/schizophrenic states of mind, with the elevated fear/dread/guilt and audiovisual disturbances.

The visual hallucinations aren't anything like LSD or most psychedelics. It's hard to describe how they differ, they're just less colorful and animated. More like repeating patterns of distortions that vaguely represent spiders and stuff - for me, there was no way I actually thought I was seeing spiders. Just spider-like patterns over top of my visual field.   Pretty worthless as a recreational drug.   Phenergen, which is a slightly more potent anticholinergic, is wonderful, though.

It's cheap enough to try anyway, $9-12 for 30 doses.  Anecdotally, it's useful for reducing intrusive thoughts and just feeling comfortable in normally stressful situations.    L-theanine is also a good starting option for protecting against small levels of stress, but nothing major.  Magnesium glycinate/citrate would probably also be useful if you don't get a lot of magnesium in your diet, low levels are correlated with worse anxiety symptoms.  Regular is the other intervention for improving cognition function, but I understand it can be difficult depending on circumstances.  Some might suggest tianeptine for its antidepressant effects, but it carries a dependence risk when people escalate the doses and I'm not sure if it's riskier with bipolar... but it might be worth considering with caution.

(At least that's how it's been for me). Just don't overdo it. Baby steps.    As for the brain fog and robotic behavior - (bear with me here) I had SEVERE Ulcerative Colitis. This is an intestinal disease. If it gets bad enough it will GREATLY effect your mood and health. (You have a ""second brain"" in your gut which influences your main brain -  google it). Basically this caused me extreme everything. Paranoia, anxiety, delusion, mood swings, hallucinations etc. When I say extreme I mean EXTREME. I was certifiable.  When I found a good doctor and cured it with a Specific Carbohydrate Diet all the intense moods went away. BUT so did my emotions. I am now just as you described. I enjoy almost nothing, no real emotion besides irritation or anger (even a fly can be irritated...) most of the time neutral or negative. I can't really miss being happy. I don't even understand happy. I have no drive to do anything, I carry out my day like a robot.    I am afraid I have no advice for the last part. The best I can do is tell you what I HAVE tried, so you know not to waste your time or at least bank on it as a cure... My current lifestyle. Diet:   Gluten free (Doctors orders, no difference) Sucrose/Sugar free (Severely Intolerant, massive difference) Wheat free (it's GMO with toxins, little difference) Soy free (it's GMO with toxins, little difference) Corn (it's GMO with toxins, no difference) All my food is ""whole food"" no processed crap, no additives. Lots of fruits, vegetables, rice, some dairy. No restaurants ever (sugar in everything...).   This has made a HUGE MASSIVE difference for me. Try eliminating certain foods. Be aware if anything bothers you. I know you don't have any intestinal issues, but you will likely find that one or two things mess you up in the head. A lot of people have allergies to foods and don't realize. I was living with OVER 120 food allergies. You can bet that causes massive brain fog. I can now remember 10 digit numbers with ease where as before I could not remember 5 numbers without chanting them. Concentration has improved as well. Just something to think about.    Supplements. I take Vital Nutrients no Iron or Iodine. This is the highest quality Multivitamin on Planet Earth. Ingredients: http://www.vitalnutrients.net/images/products/facts/VNMI.jpg Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Vital-Nutrients-Multi-Nutrients-Vegetarian-Capsules/dp/B000ZJS68O/ Huge difference here. You want energy and clarity of mind? Try these. It might not be a ""cure"" but it will get you closer to what you seek.  I also have about 50 different suppliments and nootropics in my cabinet but they have had next to no effect. Modafinil and 50mg caffiene is ""ok"" but that's about it.    I tried 23andme.com Genetic testing for SNP mutations. I'm taking and avoiding everything recommended because of my mutations. Little difference. Methylcobalamin B12 and folic/folinic acid causes me a lot of anxiety Hydroxycobalamin B12 reduces it. You might look into this. The multivitamin I posted has methylcobalamin in it so I stopped taking it and rebuilt my multi with separate supplements from Now Foods. This is the best brand for supplements as they have NO ADDITIVES and are cheaper then the competition 95% of the time.    TL;DR Good lord I wrote a book.  Bottom half is a list of things I've done to stop being a robot and get emotion back. No success but at least we can rule out these as a potential cure. (Not that you shouldn't eat healthy etc).  Good luck."

Have you had any recent lab workup, such as CBC, comprehensive metabolic/hepatic panels, sex and thyroid hormones, lipids, C-reactive protein etc.?  Are you over/under weight?  Do you exercise regularly?  Do you get quality sleep; 7-9 hours?"
StackAdvice,37vx26,phaedo_cyp,1 point,Sun May 31 03:54:55 2015 UTC,"I'm normal weight, and I don't have any visible health issues. I got a thorough examination 8 months ago. Everything came back in the lab's normal range. Liver enzymes, blood counts for CBC etc were perfect actually. However, my T3 levels were equal to the minimum level considered normal, and my total Testosterone was around 550, the lab's normal range being 250 to 1000. I've read that for a guy in early 30s, average total Testosterone is around 650. (sorry can't remember the units, perhaps it is ng/dl)  I don't exercise as much as I'd like to. I've been pretty active in the past, Crossfit, strength training, etc., but my drive has been so low for the past few months that it is difficult for me to go regularly. Coming home after a long day at work zaps my energy (which is again something I was able to endure a year or two ago). If I'd to make an average estimate, I run 2x/wk and strength train 2x/wk these days, and that takes a lot of motivation on my part.   Sleep is absolutely a whack. This is also a fairly new development in the last 6-7 months. I've never had trouble sleeping, but I have to use Melatonin to fall asleep these days, and even then, my sleep is not deep. On average I sleep 5-6 hours a night, accrue sleep debt during the week and then tend to sleep more during the weekend.    I'm aware of the effects of exercise on BDNF, and depression. However, I've gotten into a rut where just finding motivation to exercise, is difficult."
StackAdvice,37vx26,phaedo_cyp,2,Sun May 31 18:44:01 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about the T3 lab -- as I alluded to in the previous post, it's an inaccurate assay and only good for interpolating long term trends (in my opinion.  Many endocrinologists/urologists wouldn't even go that far).  Put more emphasis on your TSH and T4 levels at this point.  Additionally, testosterone fluctuates wildly from diet, sleep, stress, exercise, and even time of day. Your testosterone levels weren't good, but they weren't bad.  An better accompanying test would be total and free testosterone and estradiol (sensitive panel, since you're a male).    Exercise and sleep will make a big difference in your energy levels,  except the lack of energy is discouraging you from attending the gym.  It's a vicious circle, isn't it?  Increase sleep length and quality accompanied with consistent and vigorous exercise will result in higher testosterone and thyroid (metabolic) activity, which is then a consequence of more motivation, clearing thinking, better sleep, and increased fitness.  The concomitant effects are such that you need to break into the circle wherever you think is easiest to reverse the direction.   From my parochial experience, I've always thought sleep is the easiest to fix -- just dedicate a strict bedtime and alarm that is conducive to your workday and weekend schedules and stick with it.  Discipline here is key.  Melatonin is a low-risk supplement that I would keep using if it works, and you may consider an antihistamine as well.  Avoid bright (blue) lights and keep with all the standard pre-sleep routines.    With the stack you suggested, I would try to trim down the dopamine modulators.  Your goal, I think, is to return to an organic baseline and not induce an artificial increase or unsustainable surge of well being/drive.  Use of these compounds should help you rearrange your life in such a way as to incentivize healthy thinking and habits (I know that sounds corny) but the combination listed can perhaps be more detrimental in the long term.      I would start with Tianeptine and Semax. Both effect BDNF directly and enhance dopaminergic signaling.  Cognitive capacity, mental alertness, motivation, etc. should help alleviate dysphoria and incentivize other lifestyle changes to hopefully reverse the cycle.  Have you used either of these compounds previously?  Modafinil is also handy, but remember that because you can keep going without sleep doesn't mean you don't need it.  Whatever you cancel on the front end is likely gonna be made up on the back end.  I would use Modafinil only as required.    Lastly, try to exercise at least five days a week.  I try to workout first things in the mornings because 1) I am most energetic, 2) usually cannot use the ""I'm too busy"" excuse to validate my absence from the gym, and 3) no matter how wrong your day goes, at least you successfully hit the gym.  A combination of weights and cardio will offer the most benefit and can likely raise your testosterone... 200 points?  I personally experienced a 350 point rise (525 to 875 ng/dL). If anything, plop yourself on the elliptical and spin around for 30-40 minutes and listen to a podcast."

Yes, I'm not looking to get into an excessive drive frenzy, my baseline motivation 10 years ago was extremely high, so I just want to get back to that. I've ordered Tinapetine Sulfate and will add Semax to it. I've never used them before, so I'm looking forward to the effects. I'm hoping that with these two, I will get enough improvement in my drive and mood so that I am able to get in a cycle of exercising, socializing and good sleep.  I'm able to cut down on Modafinil as well, it is only for special days since it does affect my circadian rhythm badly."
StackAdvice,37vx26,basstrippin,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:12:03 2015 UTC,Start with Tianeptine without inclusion of Semax or other compounds and see how you do.  Asses your well-being on a day-to-day basis and then determine if Semax can provide additional or unnecessary benefit.  I also just thought you should take a vitamin D supplement (2000 IU/day) if you don't receive much (direct) sunlight.
StackAdvice,37vtce,fumg,1 point,Sat May 30 20:38:52 2015 UTC,"Don't expect too much from just nootropics. They have an effect, but it's not an overwhelming effect. If you're struggling academically I wouldn't expect nootropics to single-handedly reverse that fact. That said, you can get a small but significant edge that many of your fellow students will not have.   In my opinion piracetam is the best available nootropic for short term academic use. Modest gains to memory and cognition are very useful in a test environment. Could take it with a choline source, which seems plausible that it would be beneficial, but the best available data is mixed on whether choline supplementation has any effect. Either way, be sure to study while taking it, and also take it for the test.  If you are suffering from stress-based performance degradation (more common than most people realize) then you might switch that to aniracetam, which is similar to piracetam but has a more pronounced anxiolytic effect.   If stress is your main issue then you might consider ashwagandha instead of a racetam."

StackAdvice,37tgn2,Bfedorov91,1 point,Sun May 31 01:12:24 2015 UTC,"B complex is usually a good idea. Most noticeable effect for me is drastically reduced alcohol hangover headaches, which is nice I guess.  Suntheanine has no noticeable effect for me, even combined with coffee. Part of the problem might be that it gets absorbed better if you take it without other proteins and I always have some protein at breakfast. I can tell you that dose is probably going to be subtle at best if you have strong anxiety.  The important part of ashwagandha is the chronic effects, but different formulations and dosages will have either a mildly stimulating or mildly sedating effect. So that impacts whether you want to take it in the morning or at night.  Fish oil dose looks low. I don't bother with fish oil (I can't swallow pills due to anxiety and I've heard it tastes awful) and just eat a can of sardines every other day and that alone adds up to 4 times the amount per day you're getting from that capsule.  With excessive worrying I assume you have pretty bad sleep onset insomnia? You might want to do some research about sleep-improving stacks. 100% DV magnesium citrate/glycinate + 0.3 mg melatonin is a mild, safe start.  If the SSRI makes it too difficult to climax ask for bupropion or something else that ups dopamine/noradrenaline/libido as an adjunct. Also you might want to look into some sort of lubricant to deal with the issue if you don't use that already. Sounds obvious but it took me a few weeks to think of when I started.  Creatine supplementation is cheap and has been shown to have some antidepressant effects, especially on women.  Blood tests are good too. I was deficient in vitamin D and testosterone."

However, many people experience the opposite from SSRIs.  I see a psychiatrist and cognitive behavioral therapist. Progress is slow.

StackAdvice,37oxms,aquantiV,0,Sat May 30 18:13:39 2015 UTC,"For some people, porn is an extremely potent dopamine releasing agent which causes a strong addiction. If you are already addicted to porn and find yourself seeking out bigger and stronger hits of dopamine through new or extreme types of porn, you can be sure that you're digging a deeper hole which you will inevitably need to climb out of. It's possible that some of your depression symptoms are caused by the neural changes as a result of your porn addiction. If that's the case, you'll need to exercise very regularly and eat lots of wholesome natural foods to boost neurogenesis and hopefully reverse the negative changes you've created.  Do not leave this until you are older because it gets harder to rewire your brain the older you get. My hunch is that in 10-15 years, the neurotoxic effects of porn addiction will be common knowledge and porn will be treated in much the same way as drugs like amphetamine I.e. Need to regulate the frequency with the dose to avoid negative effects to your brain (low dose every month might not do any damage but a 3 hour long binge session every second day would not be safe). My advice: Do some research on porn addiction and treat porn like meth."

I'm not sure I'm impressed with the bromantane yet, but this is my second day upping the dose from 50 to 100mg and it has definitely been a much better experience so far. I'm also supplementing with half-dosed CDP choline, mostly for the uridine, and it seems to be having benefits with mood/energy stability and focus while on NSI.  I also find that NSI-189 works very well with phenylalanine or, more specifically, an algae-derived form of PEA and phycocyanin.  People also report very low-dose noopept as not contraindicative. I don't like mixing racetams and NSI, though, especially since I get a really great effect from racetams after an NSI cycle.  Royal Jelly potentiates the mood and (I'm presuming and by extension) BDNF+ aspects of NSI-189, perhaps too much: I was finding myself having intense difficulty focusing after about half a month of NSI-189 freebase when stacking it with sublingual RJ, but I could tolerate a full month on the phosphate with PEA/phycocyanin.

StackAdvice,37hzdt,Selasce,2,Thu May 28 15:57:07 2015 UTC,"Hey. Fellow Aspie, here. I don't think that most of what you want to accomplish can be significantly nudged with currently existing supplement and medication options. If it could, then those would be the standard treatment for Asperger's rather than teaching social and organizational skills.  If you're trying to improve social aptitude, I suggest concentrating on learning social skills. The key thing is to think of them as skills that can be learned through studying and that improve with practice. I've also found that reading books on social psychology has improved my capacity to mentally model other people. The standard method for teaching social skills to autistic people is rote-memorization, but I've found that this seems to result in confusing knowledge gaps if done without an understanding of the way neurotypical minds would. I've found that social skills seem to improve with improved executive function, but your mileage may vary.  Stimulants may improve your executive function in some ways, but they may also worsen your capacity to switch tasks. When it comes to executive function, you're going to want to learn organizational skills either in addition to or instead of taking medication.  If you have sensory problems, you're going to want to learn to cope with those as well as you can. Sensory over-stimulation or under-stimulation, in addition to being unpleasant, can exacerbate executive functioning issues. Some people suggest controlled exposure over the course of time to sensory-intensive environments, but again, your mileage may vary.   Some people have found fidgets or stim toys useful for controlling sensory problems or improving executive function. A lot of the stim toys on the market are designed for kids, but some are more adult-like.   Here are is a valuable social skills resource: http://www.succeedsocially.com/"

StackAdvice,37hzdt,DoreenGreen,2,Thu May 28 17:57:42 2015 UTC,"I'm autistic and have done extensive research on this subject, though my focus is on sensory processing deficiencies.  Autism is a heterogeneous disorder that is multifactorial in nature, but the prevailing consensus these days is that there is a large glutamatergic and GABAergic component.  Animal models have shown that a perturbation (in either direction) of the normal excitatory/inhibitory ratio can give rise to an autistic phenotype.  As a result, when dealing with social dysfunction, it's impossible to tell which direction the problem is without more information.  Therefore, you should try to determine which direction of skew is causing your problem.  In my case it's trivially easy because of the pervasive sensory dysfunction (too much E, not enough I, which is the more common presentation in human idiopathic autism).  I have done no reading about how to increase excitatory activity at the expense of inhibitory activity, but /r/nootropics is constantly talking about that sort of thing.  If your problem is like mine, however, a few things are of note:  Autistics generally have a perturbed GABA-A subunit ratio, and often a concurrent decrease in GABA-A and GABA-B subunit density.  Bacopa has shown the ability to rehabilitate the expression of certain GABA-A subunits in epilepsy, which is another disorder of increased E/I ratio.  In particular, the alpha-1 subunit is upregulated, a subunit necessary for some of the effects of benzodiazepines (which require an alpha and gamma subunit to even bind).  The dosage used in that study is significantly smaller than you'll find in a typical bacognize brand capsule - my notes on the subject are at work, but the calculation worked out to being something well under 100 mg.  I'm too tired and sick to finish typing out a proper response to this inquiry but I can try again tomorrow if it's helpful.  In the meantime I'll just dump other stuff.  Magnolol and honokiol can perform a similar role, rehabilitating I believe GABA-A subunit alpha-5.  Melissa officinalis inhibits GABA transaminase so you don't 'use up' GABA as quickly.  Taurine and glycine together are GABAergic and glycinergic but inhibit the glycine binding site of NMDA receptors for some reason so they're almost strictly inhibitory when stacked.  Being magnesium deficient is very bad for an autistic because those ions normally sit in the NMDA pores and if they're missing, you're going to have a bad time.  The guy who said to dump 5HTP is probably right because the serotonin receptor 5HT2B is bad to activate because it can harden the valves of your heart with chronic agonism.  There is no pharmacotherapy for executive function as far as I'm aware."

StackAdvice,37hzdt,Debonaire_Death,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:38:13 2015 UTC,"Pretty much every stimulant does that one way or another, so a specific answer would depend on which pathways you're particularly interested in.  I'm not very well versed in that side of things because if I increased E too much more I'd probably seize and possibly die.  I do know of one avenue of research that is currently ongoing, which is the development of GABA-B antagonists (think the opposite of phenibut).  They're generally based on baclofen and have similar names e.g. saclofen and phaclofen.  I'm not a fan of these drugs in theory because insufficient GABA-B activity can cause dysfunction in the FMRP pathway which is responsible for modulating gene expression, but in practice I don't know if there is any conclusive report on their safety.  These, like the agonists at the same site, need more study.  Some racetams also exhibit glutamatergic properties e.g. oxiracetam acting as a positive allosteric modulator at AMPA receptors.  These generally don't directly decrease inhibitory activity, merely enhancing excitatory activity.  Racetams are heterogeneous, though, so many don't have these properties.  /r/nootropics is generally focused on increasing excitatory activity for cognitive purposes, either directly or by shifting the ratio in that direction through decreasing inhibition.  People there would be a better resource than me."

Then he had the worst withdrawls I have seen.  My advice is to stay away from it. If you have social anxiety my suggestion would be to try to work through it mentally and if you really feel the need for auxiliary sources of anxiety relief, there a million other anxiolytics  that are safer (for example, nearly all of the racetams, l-theanine, ashwaganda, etc). Also good diet, and exercise work wonders for not only anxiety but for mental boost too.   Good luck and don't beat yourself up too much"
StackAdvice,37gn8d,nuxeon,1 point,Wed May 27 15:09:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah your right. I guess it's just too hard for me to deal with the fact of consciousness being so loose and changeable. The strange thing is is that I have no social anxiety what so ever, I just have this overall feeling of loss of potential and that might consciousness changed too fast. L-theanine is okay, but a good diet has helped tremendously."
StackAdvice,37gn8d,4fucks_capacitor,2,Wed May 27 16:25:36 2015 UTC,"I recommend that people just stay away from the stuff entirely.  I'm not sure how much you've been taking but any amount of sustained use and you'll end up with tolerance and a withdrawal that will make you feel....not whole  Phenibut gets thrown around here far to often in my opinion and people seem to forget that it can be as much of a recreational drug as it can be a ""nootropic"", if you want to call it that. We scoff at the idea of taking opioids for pleasure, or to treat anxiety but in reality, people become addicted to both because it makes them ""feel whole""  My advice: Taper down slowly and then quit completely. Drink water, exercise and practice mindfullness."
StackAdvice,37gn8d,4fucks_capacitor,0,Wed May 27 15:19:43 2015 UTC,"You get me wrong. I'm not addicted, nor was I ever. Though I did use too much. I'm just scared that there was some underlying excitotoxicity that hasn't truly left and is now starting to show effects. How long in a benzo withdrawl until neurotoxicity become a non-issue? I never had any seizures or any major outward symptoms. I just felt a little different, and lately I have felt even more different. Idk. And yeah, I agree. Phenibut is NOT a nootropic.  Its a glorified version of xanax thats easier to get ahold of and harder to get addicted to. Though I never was addicted, a quick google search convinced me to stop before I became. Mediation has helped somewhat, but also made me more sad I feel. Exercise, on the other hand, is fantastic. Very good for health."

Once achieved it enhances your awareness and puts you in control of your thought process volitionally. Several others in this thread have recommended it and I whole heartedly agree. And its a very convenient way to meditate, you don't need to set aside time to sit, you do it whenever you want (although sitting for 15min here or there definitely speed up the learning process).  Also do be careful with phenebut. It really does a number on the GABA system and I've heard many accounts of dangerous withdrawals and high tolerance issues. Definitely taper as well. Also I want to suggest to cut back drastically on the drinking. I'm not trying to be on a high horse or be judgmental, Im speaking from a perspective of giving you the information you're requesting and I know for a fact you'll feel better without it.  Its one of the most harmful substances for someone who's seeking harmony.  Also consider looking into a ketogenic diet. I've been on one for 2 years and not only did I lose 120lbs but I have never had a clearer or more effective mind. Its just a low carb diet to get you off of glucose as your primary fuel source and onto ketones. There's more benefits to that diet than I care to list out so definitely google it up.

I like caffiene + L-theanine, but I'm used to caffiene and don't get manic from for some reason from the caffiene. If you do already consume caffiene, for me, adding L-theanine made the caffiene more linear and not as uppity high.    EDIT: My pDoc said all of the above supplements were safe for me. Everyone has a different brain, so I'd at run everything by your pDoc. For example, st. John's wort is very psychoactive.

If the inositol made the symptoms worse, I knew it was just allergies and went about my day. Normally with drugs like this, as the body attenuates the experience, the immune system will do the same; my allergy symptoms went away in one to two weeks.

It's a controlled substance in most countries because of this.  It's really not hard to find experience reports on this.   https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1jield/kicking_tianeptine_my_wd_journal/
StackAdvice,36xpp7,dbbo,2,Sat May 23 01:46:30 2015 UTC,"I'm skeptical that its activity as a mu-opioid agonist is significantly responsible for the withdrawal symptoms. The one in vitro study on its MOR activity demonstrated a very low affinity (several orders of magnitude lower than morphine), and its efficacy as an opioid has not been established.   Yes, there are supporting anecdotes and OP did admit to taking a high dose. But the withdrawal symptoms they described were not specific to opioids and are in fact well-established in the cessation of other TCAs, the vast majority of which have no appreciable opioid activity."

StackAdvice,36xpp7,probablytoomuch,2,Sat May 23 20:50:01 2015 UTC,"Preface: The safest thing to do is to see a doctor. I understand that this might be a bit of hindrance since you were (presumably) taking a drug that wasn't prescribed to you. But any decent physician's primary goal is to help you, not get you in trouble (and I'm not really sure if you even COULD get in trouble if you are in the US).  You are the best judge of how severe your symptoms are. If you feel like something is seriously wrong, then see a doctor anyway.    What you described sounds typical of TCA discontinuation syndrome (it's called ""discontinuation syndrome"" in medical circles since ""withdrawal"" is commonly associated with drugs of abuse, like opioids, even though they both mean basically the same thing). The constellation of associated symptoms can occur when any antidepressant drug is stopped abruptly, and the symptoms very from drug to drug/person to person.   It can last anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, but taking the drug that was stopped usually will significantly decrease the duration.  The best way to avoid this is to taper off as /u/shrillthrill suggested.  Two types of symptoms that normally occur with SSRIs but not TCAs are changes in sensation and balance (e.g. numbness/tingling/shocks and vertigo/dizziness). If you are having either of those, something else could be going on.  It's possible that the tics you described are a manifestation of your anxiety, or even the fact that ADS often leads to severe sleep disturbances, although without knowing all the involved factors I can't really say for certain."
StackAdvice,36xpp7,dbbo,0,Sun May 24 01:06:22 2015 UTC,"Loperamide for diarrhea, the most persistent effect of opiates is constipation anecdotally it seems to help with digestive problems during the rebound. That core gut terrible feeling is your digestive system kicking back up, fast. I guess I don't know why it happens, but with me at least that has been the case. It'll get you through the worst of the first couple days. After that, yoga and anything you can focus on instead of the shitty over sensitivity. You'll be really sensitive to every stimulus, since opiates dull your inputs- at least, I was, and I got a lot of migraines from it. It will It may manifest as overt sensitivity to pain and annoying stuff.  Just resist the temptation to fall back into it once you get through the first couple days. If you feel like tapering, make that decision now and stick to it- measure doses ahead of time and don't deviate or reorder.  If you feel capable of responsible use going forward, take steps to limit your use to non-increasing doses. Track them, don't lose track of them. It's too easy to lose awareness of how much you take at one time.  One step, one day at a time. You'll get a lot of things back once you get clear of it, stuff you didn't know you lost. Good luck.  Just to be clear, at the higher doses, and I'm talking >very< high doses, tianeptine behaves more like an opiate both perceptually and empirically and quitting long time, high use causes many of the same effects of opiate withdrawal. Tianeptine is a opiate mild opiate.  Second edit: Since I don't want to be one of the assholes who perpetuates false information, I will defer to dbbo regarding the practical efficacy of tianeptine as an opiate. I will leave up my comment in the interest of transparency, but I want to be clear- if you subtract the mentions of opiates in my advice, I still believe it is helpful. Regardless of how and why it happens, constipation is a very common side effect of tianeptine- it's on the labelling/packaging, as well as in numerous studies (here's one). Limiting the rebound diarrhea (that >anecdotally< may occur) with loperamide helped me a lot. I also don't want to give the impression I suggest loperamide because it's technically an opiate- it is strictly for the diarrhea-prevention factor."
StackAdvice,36xpp7,probablytoomuch,2,Sat May 23 03:54:18 2015 UTC,"See here.  In short: tianeptine's MOR affinity is very low, and its efficacy as an opioid is not established (i.e. just because a drug can bind to a receptor at all does not necessarily mean that that receptor pathway is significant to its pharmacological effects), and OP's symptoms are common with cessation of other TCAs in addition to not being specific to opioids."
StackAdvice,36xpp7,dbbo,2,Sun May 24 01:15:16 2015 UTC,"To be perfectly honest I hadn't previously considered the affinity of tianeptine in the context of another opiate. You are correct, it's probably not anything related to ""opiate withdrawal"", and I'm sorry for the misinformation.  However, I'm not so certain about your claim regarding it being similar to TCA cessation. Your link for TCA discontinuation syndrome is not working, so maybe there's some evidence there I'm not aware of. There are some interesting notes here although the English seems a little broken. Interestingly enough, it compares and contrasts opiate withdrawal and tianeptine withdrawal- I say that not because I think they are similar but because the timing is kind of funny.

I dont use all my composite chemicals together or on a daily basis because of the potential for Phenibut addiction and I want to avoid as much tolerance buildup as possible.  Essentially I have it set into two separate ministacks, if you will. I have my social stack, and my study stack. I've found that 0.5g Phenibut, with the addition of 250mg L-Theanine and about the same of Phenylalanine really removes any anxiety and depression I have and almost makes me feel like a different person. I'm fairly outgoing as it is however I have occasionally had major depressive and introverted moments, but these have all but disappeared after I started using this stack, and has certainly made my life a lot better. I've become a lot more adventurous, and I also don't mind starting conversations with strangers or walking into rooms full of people which I used to have serious trouble with, and apparently I'm more fun to be around too! However, you really do have to be careful if you decide to try Phenibut because the addiction potential is very real. Unless I have a lot planned I'll only use this stack twice a week at the most to keep safe.  The other stack then, is my study stack. This is comprised of 200mg Modafinil, 30mg Noopept, around 200mg Sulbultiamine and 250mg L-Theanine as it keeps me from panicking about my upcoming exams. This combination has produced absolutely mindblowing results for me, however I only use it every other day to stop myself from building a tolerance as much as possible but on those days I am more than happy and able to study all day and well into the early hours of the morning with no trouble whatsoever, it seriously is an amazing combination. This past Monday I revised an entire exams worth of content in one sitting, and got an A on a practice paper I did yesterday, which is way higher than I've got in that module before.  I've used Adrafanil in the past, and I didn't get an entirely positive response. For me, this caused me to acquire a stutter whilst using it, and for a few days afterwards as well. Also, I found that if I didn't use it on a daily basis I wouldn't be able to function properly the day after taking it and I'd become very sluggish and unmotivated, with a pretty foul mood to go along with it. However Modafinil has given me all the positives Adrafinil gave, without the grogginess the day after. However It does make the headaches I usually get more frequent, however these disappear after taking a couple of Ibroprofen tablets.

I would just try one or the other at a time with the rest of your stack and see if you like those effects. Both of them are supposed to elicit tolerances, so maybe you could go 2 days adrafinil, 2 days phenylpiracetam: switch back and forth and keep yourself sensitive to both, instead of blowing your brain chemistry on everything at once."

In order of strength (as far as I  know) there are: L-theanine, curcumin, SEMAX, SELANK, NASEMAXA, and NSI-189. There are lots of others I'm sure didn't occur to me, but these are a few I've tried.  But the best, most sustainable basis for boosting BDNF is to engage in cardio exercise, preferably at least 30 minutes straight once every other day. SELANK might be a promising adjunct for exercise, and NSI-189 is very strong but hard to come by and  can bring a host of contraindications and side effects for a lot of folks.  Fish oil is just good for anyone to take. Go for that shit. I like Ocean's 3 by Garden of Life, but I've been  experimenting with New Chapter's Wholemega and it has a more natural, less acute effect.

StackAdvice,36t9ib,grimeMuted,2,Sun May 24 13:02:36 2015 UTC,"It varies wildly from person to person. For myself, I prefer using L-theanine as a sleep aid because it gives me lethargy in anything but extremely low doses (like around 50-100mg), but it works amazingly for removing the jitters or even most other negative excitatory effects from any stack. I've never found a drug that has exhibited a contraindication with L-theanine, and it does a wonderful job of just calming all of the effects down. (I use Ceretropic's sublingual, btw: I tried Source Naturals' L-theanine tablets and they upset my stomach too much and didn't really do anything. Sublingual definitely seems to be the way to go with this stuff, for me.)  I decided to look into research regarding L-theanine and BDNF and found this nifty paper. If you look at Fig. 5 on page seven you'll see that 0.4mg/kg and 10mg/kg both showed marked increases in BDNF with chronic use. Generally you want to divide by 6 to 12 with mice dosage to get the human--for this one I went with 6. For me, at around 75 kilos, that measures to about 125mg. People respond better to much higher or lower doses than this. I would just start with 100mg and taper or titrate to a desired effect."

I take 12.5mg three times a day (morning, noon, early evening). It's advised to not take it at night. I get my stuff from NewMind - their packaging is good, product seems to be clean and effective, their shipping is lightning-fast even being in another country than them.  If you order a powder, be sure to get desiccant packets (the silica gel ones labeled ""DO NOT EAT"" you find sometimes in electronics packaging). Tianeptine absorbs air-moisture really quickly and you can find yourself with an unusable sticky glob of tianeptine pretty quickly - so put the tianpetine container in a slightly larger container packed with those silica gel packets and keep it sealed. My powder has remained fresh for six months using this method.  Some people get no effect, some people get everything they wanted and more. Like all nootropics, it's hit and miss.

StackAdvice,36kg6j,zenolijo,2,Wed May 20 10:41:24 2015 UTC,"Doesn't sound like you are dosing enough of the most important medication: exercise. Try to do it at least every other day, if not 5 days a week or more: resistance and cardio (they each have independent effects). My mood becomes far more stable and capable of recentering itself when I exercise very regularly.  I used to think that other things, like studying and the like, were more important than exercise. I've begun as a student again, and I haven't been studying nearly as much as I did my first run through college: I normally never study after 7 or 8 PM, and I have a busy schedule during the day so a lot of my reviewing would be for no more than an hour at a time, but I always exercise, every day.  I got a 4.0 this semester, and I rarely felt overworked or stressed about my schoolwork, and not one all-nighter!  Also, phenibut can produce mood instability in people with balanced chemistries: it is an extremely dangerous drug and I can't discourage it enough if you are having problems with your mood and have been diagnosed with bipolar--there are few drugs I would recommend less. I only use it once a month, and even then I'm considering scrapping that rule and only using phenibut once every 2 months, it's so treacherous (plenty of people use it more often than that without drawbacks, but then, they don't have bipolar).   As far as the best drug for bipolar, I would have to go with cannabis. I should preface that I have not been diagnosed with bipolar by a professional: after seeing my mother go through bipolar treatments with Western medicine, I'm scared to death to accept that. I do exhibit a lot of the symptoms, including long periods of severe insomnia and delusional ideations and even longer, terrible bouts of ennui and depression, when I don't medicate.  Cannabis is acutely glutamatergic but reduces NMDA receptor density with chronic use. It also has GABA activity and modulates monoamines. Overall, it is the most versatile adaptogen for a mood disorder: able to lift a person up from depression or bring them down from mania. It interacts with just about any drug, though: I'm not sure about the Seroquel. I understand if you don't want to risk quitting any of the drugs you are currently on but I have found this to be my best option and a very natural approach with minimal side effects.  Also, are you getting probiotics in your diet? If not, I would look into getting a good, strong kombucha from a health food store (GT's is great) and taking one shot in the morning on an empty stomach. Gut bacteria produce a lot of important nutrients and even neuropeptides/transmitters that benefit the mind and body."

Meditation just before sleep will  change your life. start with a thankfulness journal or prayer... Take magnesium glycinate or Epsom salts baths just before meditation..

Other supplements to consider might include sulbutiamine,  kanna (or Zembrin),  a racetam (remember that Yerkes-Dotson inverted U dose-response curve), citrulline malate, NAC,  and maybe TUDCA.

I would say that where I notice it most is not whether I am stressed out or not, but how I respond to stress/stressors.   I've been taking these for about 3 months now with some rather consistent regularity, there are spots where I will miss doses from anywhere from 1-3 days but this is infrequent.   Back to my point is that I've noticed I'm A LOT more patient with situations that may seem stressful, frustrating, etc. I don't get harried as easily, I stay calmer without really trying, and people have told me I just seem ""stoic"" at times  (Which I took to be a great compliment)  So maybe view it through a different lens.

The best thing is really opioids. I can't recommend doing them though...  It seems like you have a problem with mindfulness. Meditation is the latest fad and is touted as a panacea to everything, but for you it will absolutely help. Anxiety and a lack of focus are related to a dysfunction between the default mode (wandering mind) and task-positive network in your mind. I used to have a major problem very similar to yours. I would always think about the future, what I want to do, who I want to be, and use these thoughts to dissociate from the anxious present. The first step is shutting these down and learning to accept the anxiety. Don't battle it, don't try to mentally weasel your way out of it, just accept it and learn to live life in spite of it.  In 3 days you'll already feel better than ever before."

Pramiracetam in particular seems to work better for concentration than the others I have tried and synergistic with moda. Also caffeine works great with this combo.

StackAdvice,368ed0,Nepoxx,3,Sun May 17 04:08:10 2015 UTC,"Mindfulness meditation might help you become more focused (training to catch yourself mind wandering and gradually exercise more control).  Short of adderall or ritalin, caffeine is the main contender.  Modafinil isn't really for focus unless it's daytime sleepiness causing lapses in focus.  If you were looking for something every so slight for anxiety, you could try out l-theanine.  It'd also pair well with your existing caffeine use.  Physical exercise is the other relevant cognitive enhancer.  What's your exercise routine look like?"

Most videos I've watched on the subject tell you to focus on your energy, breathing and feel your body, however my mind still wanders. I do realize it's wandering, then I tell myself ""hey, you're doing this wrong, focus on your breathing"", then it starts again.

As for the Caffeine and L-theanine combo, do you take it in the morning, if so, does it get you through the day or do you crash after lunch?

If it's the latter, I wouldn't recommend any stimulant or eurogic. For many substances if taken frequently, your brain will homeostatically adjust affected receptors, making these substances less and less effective over time. You would have essentially sacrificed them for this job, learning little aside from bar and management skills, and whenever a real job pops up and push comes to shove, you can't use stimulants as well as before to prepare for an interview or perform well initially.  I have narcolepsy and I always remained unmediated for shitty jobs and shitty classes because I know the more frequently I take modafinil or stimulant, the less of an effect it has. It takes a prolonged tolerance break of a few months to get back to normal for me.  If you don't care or like the job, I would recommend a variety of stimulants with different mechanisms of actions all on different days so as to prevent tolerance and perhaps a GABAB agonist that leads to improved wakefulness the next day:   Armodafinil Phenlypiracetam Caffeine + L-Theanine Nicotine Methylphenidate  Any flavor of amphetamine Phenibut or Balcofen or Xyrem NO more than once a week   ** Note Xyrem/GHB is much more effective than the previously mentioned for treating excessive daytime sleepiness upon waking.

Methylphenidate is one option, but usually you'd only suggest trying it if d-amp wasn't tolerable.   Oherwise, as long as you're not abusing d-amp there's no point stopping responsible use when it benefits you.   for focus, energy and general sharpness   Exercise and mindfulness meditation are probably the only things worth doing in addition to your existing caffeine + l-theanine.

Exercise and mindfulness meditation are likely to have a more positive effect on your energy and focus than anything you can actually buy.

StackAdvice,35w0gw,jrwreno,2,Thu May 14 03:19:54 2015 UTC,"That SSRI/Prozac.....combined with Adderall or Dexamps.....are very bad partners.   Stop Prozac slowly, but starting now.   You can take your Dexamp meds 4 days in a row, and take 3 days off. This will keep your tolerance low and reasonable. At the very least 5 days on, 2 days off.  You can replace Prozac with something like Trazadone, which will aid your sleep, but not be such a bad antidepressant. Prozac can retard your ability to develop emotional maturity or resilience, for people who start on it young. Depression is a chemical imbalance, and SSRI's are very powerful. Taking supplements like 5-HTP and Theanine can naturally help your neurotransmitters stabilize. Please consult your Dr first, because weening off of Prozac is a big task. Never do cold-turkey.  Start supplementing with 200mg of 5HTP, nightly. This will level out and rebalance serotonin levels.   Take l-acetyl carnitine with each meal, it greatly increases focus, as well as metabolism, and aids memory considerably. Partnering this with some gentle caffeine will increase your success.   Take L-Tyrosine 1-2 times daily, with your meals. This promotes your brains ability to regenerate dopamine and other neurotransmittors depleted by stims. Noradrenaline and dopamine specifically.  Take L-Theanine in the evenings to help relax, and clear oxidative stress.   Take 5mg of Melatonin before bed, this clears the neurotoxicity of the stim use. It also balances serotonin.   Uridine is an amino acid potentiator that helps repair nerve proteins damaged in the brain.   Take Potassium and Magnesium at night to replenish what the stims pull out of the brain. This also helps you calm down.  Take a Vitamin D supplement to support brain function, as well as working as an antioxident, providing theraputic levels of protection against neurotoxicity.   All these supplements can be bought on Amazon."

StackAdvice,35v14x,meowzarr,3,Wed May 13 19:15:48 2015 UTC,Which Kratom would you recommend for anxiety?
StackAdvice,35v14x,Selasce,1 point,Wed May 13 21:24:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, they all serve as a good remedy for generalized anxiety, so it's a matter of preference. I prefer white veins during the day because they are usually stimulating and give me that extra boost & euphoria to get my work done or be comfortable in a social setting. Some people find white veins too stimulating and prefer a maeng da or green vein. Red Veins usually tend to be more sedating so I will take those at night to help more with my chronic neck pain. Remember the general rule of thumb with kratom is that low doses tend to be stimulating and high doses tend to be sedating regardless of the strain. If I were you, I'd put in an order with herbal-salvation.com and get the $6 sample pack. You get to choose 4 strains (10g each). I recommend their White Vietnam, Thai Maeng Da, Green Malaysian & Red Vein Thai to start with. Try about 2 grams of any strain to start with and see what you think. Don't mix strains at first bc it will just raise your tolerance. Rotating strains is a good way to keep a low tolerance. It's all about finding that sweet spot."
StackAdvice,35v14x,Selasce,1 point,Thu May 14 14:50:01 2015 UTC,"Another tip is that herbal-salvation sort of has their kratom hidden on the website... search ""speciosa"" to find all the strains they have to offer or search ""sample"" to pull up the $6 sample pack I recommended. When asking them any questions don't make any reference to ingestion as it cannot be sold for human consumption. Lastly, stay away from ""enhanced leaf"", ""extracts"" and ""tinctures"" those will kill your tolerance quickly."

StackAdvice,35vjcp,Selasce,1 point,Wed May 13 21:31:40 2015 UTC,"Anything that deals with anxiety is not really a ""true"" nootropic. But what I've found works for anxiety are Ashwagandha, L-theanine, Phenibut, and Tianeptine, Phenibut being the most social. You shouldn't take Phenibut more than twice a week though.  For motivation and focus, I recommend modafinil (also not a ""true"" nootropic) and / or piracetam, oxiracetam, or noopept. Take one or more of those for a few days, and if you get headaches, get CDP Choline to go with it as well. Choline is also mildly stimulating. The reason I don't recommend Alpha-GPC at first is because it's much more powerful and causes negative reactions much more frequently.  Aside from chemical enhancement, I've found that very detailed planning of how I'm going to use my time has been the best productivity encourager. I use tasks in google calendar to schedule what homework I'm going to do when, how much of it, etc. It's definitely helped me out.  Since it looks like depression and anxiety are your problem, my bottom line recommendation for a starter stack is start with 1600 mg of Piracetam 3x per day, and 12.5 to 15 mg of Tianeptine 3x per day. Throw in some Ashwagandha if you feel like you need more anxiolytic power."

Some common supplements to try for increasing the effectiveness of dopamine releasing agents like adderall are  (NOTE: make sure to buy the right isomer (mirror image of a molecule) as some supplements are made with both like L-Theanine, when they're made both D & L isomers are generated, and as it is not cost effective to try and separate them, some cheaper supplement manufacturers sell it in a mix and just raise the dose so you get same amount of the active ingredient.  In the case of theanine the D isomer is non bioactive and as useful as ingesting cellulose. I personally take suntheanine which is supposed to only contain the L molecule. )   •Phenylalanine - an essential(meaning your body doesn't synthesize it on it's own and gets it from food) amino acid used to make a portion of key neurotransmitters, namely the big 3 dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. This is done as phenylalanine is converted to l-tyrosine and then to dopamine.  To boost only dopamine take l-tyrosine by itself.   •L-theanine to reduce jittery speedy feeling, it increases gaba- an inhibitory nt.  (Don't supplement with GABA directly as it doesn't pass the BBB (blood-brain-barrier))  •Magnesium as magnesium oxide for bruxism- grinding of the teeth, be careful not to exceed 500 because due to it's lubricating properties it becomes an effective laxative.   •St. John's Wort now I know what you're thinking, omg this dude wants to kill me via serotonin syndrome; if you take 300-600 mg regularly you'll notice increased wellbeing due to it being a natural antidepressant, also due to being a herbal alkaline it's speculated to have very very mild MAOI properties.

For me I would try noopept first since it's only a low dosage you have to take about 10-40mg. That will last you a very logn time if you get like 500mg of it.   Modafinil was okay for me some times it would work and some times it wouldn't. At the moment I'm taking aniracetam, and cdp-choline, and l-theanine.   L-theanine is new to me but i got the pill form 200mg a every dosage. I'm taking that twice a day. I'm also studying for exam for work in the next month. You should try piracetam , then aniracetam, and oxiracetam. Modafinil should be your last option but make sure you take it few weeks before the exam. You don't want to take it during the exam because it might back fire on you."

However phenibut is considered high risk because it causes rapid tolerance to develop and so can be highly addictive. Personally I've never tried it, but plenty of others on here have and rate it highly.   Aniracetam can be anxiolytic going on posts I've read on here. Didn't have that effect on me, it made me irritable.   The rest are stimulating to different extents, and might be too stimulating all at once. They should help with concentration and wakefulness.  Adrafinil is converted to modafinil by the liver and modafinil is a wakefulness promoter. Repeated  adrafinil use can effect the liver, but I understand some places can't get modafinil so don't have that option. If you can get modafinil that would be better.   Ashwagandha reduces cortisol, a hormone produced when you're stressed.   Maybe introduce one at a time, gauge your response and see what works?"

Physical fitness takes a while to build up, some effort to maintain.   The benefits may not disappear immediately if you stop exercising completely,  but I'd wager they'd be more useful if continued in moderation.  Caffeine: The benefits of using it will disappear if you stop using it because they're acute.  If you've used it frequently, then caffeine withdrawal could make you perform worse.  Generally that's why it's wiser to taper or reduce their caffeine intake gradually rather than stopping cold turkey to be completely non-functional."

StackAdvice,354cyn,Jackolysis,2,Thu May 7 00:31:59 2015 UTC,"Not true regarding Piracetam. There is a study showing enhancement in healthy, college-aged individuals over a 2 week period as well as a number of others:   Nootropyl (Piracetam) a drug reported to facilitate learning in animals was tested for its effect on man by administering it to normal volunteers. The subjects were given 3x4 capsules at 400 mg per day, in a double blind study. Each subject learned series of words presented as stimuli upon a memory drum. No effects were observed after 7 days but after 14 days verbal learning had significantly increased.   Source: Increase in the power of human memory in normal man through the use of drugs.  Supplementing choline and other neurotransmitter precursors works as well, so I presume you did something wrong (dosing, tracking changes, etc).   The studies that are summarized in this brief review provide evidence for another major difference between most neurotransmitters and all hormones, i.e. their different dependencies on precursor availability. The rates at which serotonin, acetylcholine, and perhaps other neurotransmitters are synthesized in the brain depend in part on ""open-loop"" control systems: synthesis increases or decreases as a con- sequence of diet-induced changes in the plasma concentrations of their precursors.   ...  The uses of these open-loop control mechanisms to the scientist and the physician are, happily, much more obvious: the fact that choline (or tryptophan) administration rapidly accelerates brain acetylcholine (or serotonin) synthesis provides the investigator with an enormously useful tool for manipulating cholinergic (or serotoninergic) synapses with a relatively high degree of specificity, and provides the clinician with a novel, and probably safe, tool for treating disease states thought to be related to inadequate cholinergic (or serotoninergic) transmission.  ...  It should not be surprising that acetylcholine synthesis can be accelerated by treatments that elevate brain choline (or, presumably, acetyl CoA) levels. What is perhaps surprising is that this effect was not fully documented until 1975  ...  Acetyl-choline (and choline-containingphospholipids). More recent studies have affirmed that treatments which elevate brain choline levels subsequently increase those of acetylcholine and have further shown that this effect is especially marked within the caudate nucleus. The consumption of 129mg of dietary choline/day for 11 days was associated with caudate acetylcholine concentrations that were 46 per cent greater than those found in control animals on cho- line-free diets, and 15 per cent greater than those in animals eating 20 mg choline/day. These increases in brain acetylcholine produced by administering physostigmine were additive to those produced by adding choline to the diet, affirming that choline raises brain acetylcholine by accelerating its synthesis.  ...  Both the therapeutic effect and the side effect provide evidence that choline-induced changes in acetylcholine synthesis do, in fact, modify the flow of information across cholinergic synapses.   Source:  CONTROL OF BRAIN NEUROTRANSMITTER SYNTHESIS BY PRECURSOR AVAILABILITY AND NUTRITIONAL STATE  The body uses the dietary level to regulate how much of acetylcholine that it makes, I recommend citicoline (CDP-choline) as it is more stimulating with and less people have side effects with it compared to other forms like alpha-gpc."

Yeah, I didn't like how I felt either but I chose to continue when I asked how long I should expect to wait.  Hopefully you'll have better luck with the SJW.  The serotonin hypothesis of depression is just a thing that people used to speak about but don't anymore because it's more complex than saying low or high 'serotonin'.  I would guess that he was trying to find something to say about the medical reason for your depression.  Bloodwork most likely would have been to check B12, folate, iron and possibly Vitamin D status.    Blood work examining serotonin to 'detect depression' is something only being researched rather than actually part of medical practice.    Back to SJW:  The 350mg one you bought here wouldn't really be recommended because it's not standardized.  The research on SJW being actually useful refers to the extract, such as this product.   Given the difference, it's difficult to say if what you bought would be worth taking.  Other concerns:     SJW and Paxil can't be taken together.  There may also be a washout period where you can't use either. SJW can affect other medications, are you using any others (e.g. oral contraceptive (assuming you're female from your username))?   5-HTP:  Some people say it worsens their anxiety.  I'm kinda hesitant to recommend it in general.  I can't see any published research saying the combination with SJW is safe.  The fish oil and green tea extract should be fine to start.

Watch video reviews of people on piracetam and you should get it. For some people it also seems to remove their verbal filter so they end up saying things they shouldn't and other stuff. And there's cycling / withdrawl.    There could be lots of causes for the way you feel. I don't think piracetam or other racetams will fix it.

StackAdvice,3506tv,jlo98370,3,Wed May 6 00:37:32 2015 UTC,"If you've got health insurance, the best way to get help for social anxiety, depression and lethargy is to find a psychiatrist and therapist, get prescribed an antidepressant that works for you, and while you're experiencing the initial mood lift from it work through some talk therapy to help get at the root of why you're not able to function the way you want to.  Kidneys are worth getting checked out too.  There are a couple of supplements in there that stand out as pretty acceptable across the board.  No reason you can't get right started taking the fish oil, ALA, creatine and L-theanine.  Some others are potentially dangerous, especially in combination.  I'd get a physical and try to get any other (mental/physical) health issues dealt with before you mess with DMAE, mucuna, synephrine, adrafinil, 5-HTP, phenibut or powdered caffeine.  Do your research on safety issues with those at the very least.  That is not a comprehensive list of items with possible safety issues, just the ones that jump out at me."
StackAdvice,3506tv,incredulitor,1 point,Wed May 6 14:16:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response! Unfortunately, I have already been but on a couple different SSRI's and the side effects outweighed the benefits, this is why I am hoping to find a good stack to push me in the right direction.   The doc also tells me that my kidneys are fine so I'm assuming the irritation is due to being a recovering alcoholic. I have been taking fish oil, ALA and creatine everyday but I know that I could benefit from more of these supplements that I have lying around.  Out of the supps that you listed, I can only find evidence of adrafinil, phenibut and of course, powdered caffeine to be at all dangerous. Please correct me if I'm wrong though. Thanks again my dude, I appreciate it!"
StackAdvice,3506tv,incredulitor,2,Wed May 6 19:56:16 2015 UTC,"Good luck with your recovery.  Maybe you could try an SDRI, SNRI, MAOI or multi-acting RI.  If you really don't like going through a psychiatrist for these, tianeptine and St. John's Wort both have some solid science behind them and are available pretty cheaply OTC.  DMAE I may have been mistaken about.  Apparently it's pretty safe.  Mucuna: the primary active ingredient, L-dopa, is implicated in dyskinesias that are probably specific to Parkinson's but we don't really know for sure.    http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/10762142  It can also interact with bipolar:  http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/7304798  and schizophrenia:  http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00429294#page-1  It can reduce blood pressure on its own but it's not known how this would interact with other drugs in your stack that might raise blood pressure.  It's also downstream of L-tyrosine and NALT: one of ways your body uses tyrosine is to convert it into L-dopa.  By taking something with L-dopa in it you're already bypassing a possible rate-limiting step in that pathway.  Downstream of that, excessive norepinephrine will make you nervous, and excessive dopamine can lead to impulsive behavior, paranoia and psychosis.  Not a lot is known about synephrine, so some of the risk is from it being understudied, and some from its relationship to ephedrine.  According to examine it can raise blood pressure: http://examine.com/supplements/Synephrine/#summary7 which might be OK but seems to me like more of a concern if you're already thinking about mixing other stimulants, anxiolytics and blood pressure modulators.  One of ephedrine's mechanism of action is norepinephrine, and if we're being cautious we might want to assume that this applies to synephrine too.  This is at the same time that you're increasing your body's production of norepinephrine by taking L-tyrosine, NALT and mucuna.  5-HTP seems to be pretty safe except for the fact that you seem to be aiming to modulate dopamine at the same time.  That could be OK, except that there could be an inverse relationship between serotonin and dopamine that could make it difficult or even counterproductive to try to bump up your brain's stores of both: http://quantimind.blogspot.com/2010/02/mood-motivation-and-neurotransmitters.html  That's not to say that these are unsafe across the board, just that some thought needs to put into what you hope to get out of them, what kind of doses you're using and what you do and don't want to mix them with.  Do you have a scale?  What's your plan for getting a feel for these before mixing them?"
StackAdvice,3506tv,incredulitor,1 point,Thu May 7 01:13:07 2015 UTC,"Followup response: I'm the one recommending medications like MAOIs that might interact with it, but 5-HTP needs to be treated with extreme caution if you're on antidepressants.  Serotonin syndrome and all that."

Definitely talk to a doctor ASAP about that. It might just be dehydration though. Drink water. Lots of it. Like half gallon to a gallon.  Mine looks pretty similar to this, except I also take magnesium oxide, potassium gluconate, and vitamin d3. I don't take choline or fish oil yet, though.   Fish oil (heart health among other things) L-Theanine (anxiety) Caffeine Anhydrous (alertness, would have gone with regular caffeine) 5-HTP (boosts serotonin) L-tyrosine (NOT NALT (N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine)) (boosts dopamine indirectly) Natural green coffee bean extract (make sure this is EGCG (Catechins), use with the 5-HTP to prevent heart issues over time) choline bitartrate   Maybe ALCAR too?

The negative side effects with definitely affect everyone differently, our bodies process things slightly differently, we are not all completely similar as most people think! I am a daily drinker of caffeine and I can definitely say that I get these negative effects, but maybe not as severe. I might say that some people DO get these negative effects but try to pin it on other things in their lives.   I notice that caffeine takes much longer to excrete in my system than it does other people and so now I drink caffeine once in the morning and that is all, if I drink any more during lunch, it will be a very small amount (30mg or so) any more than that, will cause sleep problems for me that will affect my entire day/week.  You should also take note that, some people have lower thresholds for caffeine intake and some people have longer half-lifes of caffeine and you need to make adjustments for yourself!  *Edit: It might be affecting me more than I realize for the rest of the week as well!

StackAdvice,34u3b5,Jackolysis,4,Mon May 4 17:37:34 2015 UTC,"Modafinil has a relatively unique mechanism of action. As far as wakefulness and alertness promoting go, besides eugeroics, the primary agents are the phenethylamines and piperidines. Your main phenethylamine stimulants are amphetamine (Adderall) and substituted amphetamines, but the family also includes phenylalanine and tyrosine, which are precursors to various neurotransmitters, including dopamine, as well as hordenine, which is purported to have stimulant effects but lacks significant human research. The main piperidine is methylphenidate (Ritalin), and pretty much everything in the family is an analog of either methylphenidate or pipradrol.  Some racetams have stimulant effects. I tried phenylpiracetam with adrafinil, and it definitely enhanced the effects. I've heard, however, that you can build tolerance to phenylpiracetam and shouldn't use it every day. Oxiracetam is known to be a mild stimulant, and it has been shown to improve attention, concentration, and memory in humans. Aniracetam is an ampakine, and thus has some stimulant effects. I personally found it to enhance my ability to focus.  IDRA-21 is an ampakine that has been shown to be more potent than aniracetam. Sunifiram and unifiram are also ampakines, but they lack human studies. Synephrine and octopamine are claimed to have some stimulant-like effects. Sulbutiamine is used to treat chronic fatigue and may have positive effects on memory."

Which was really rough when there were so many Malbecs to sample. Ibuprofen took the edge off the headaches pretty quickly.

But you're missing out on long term benefits provided by other supplements like Bacopa, or any of the ones that we have good reason to believe improve your cognition/protect you from disease in the long haul.

That said, I would not use it for studying. It helps focus, but overfocus can lead to short term memory issues. I take Noopept + Semax on exam days, and while I have fantastic focus throughout the exam, recall does seem a bit harder sometimes. I'm considering swapping out the Noopept for a racetam this time.  For studying, something like nicotine/caffeine + l-theanine is probably enough for focus. I don't think anything you listed will particularly help your memory. There is some weak evidence of piracetam improving memory, but I didn't experience any of it. Some anecdotes also say that the information they retained went away after they stopped using it."

This is what I took: swisse   Swisse are kinda crap.  The product appears to be half the studied effective dose in low concentration (probably increasing your chances of gastrointestinal upset), meaning you'd have to take double the amount (not recommended because of the other unnecessary stuff they've put in there too) to expect results matching the studied effects.  I'd suggest getting a proper bacopa extract (search bacognize on vitacost - it's around $7 + $8 shipping with a ~10-15 delivery time to aus)   As for rhodiola - it can give a little boost while tired/stressed, but look for an extract with 3% salidroside rather than rosavins."

One thing the medications have in common with her is that she becomes asocial when on these medications regardless of dose, preparation, food intake, or tolerance. The decision to stick to adderall at the time was not made without deliberation. She is always sure to eat a well-rounded meal before taking these medications due to the effects on appetite.

At the start of march I started working to repair the damage. Improvement was very gradual but today my issues are pretty much gone. But it took months of my unhealthy lifestyle until symptoms of the damage started showing up, I figure that even if the symptoms have lessened, I still have months of improvement to make. Someone recommended CoQ-10 to me, I'll just copy paste his message since I'm too lazy to type it out:    ""it's a CoQ-10 supplement, which is an enzyme the body uses primarily to repair cellular damage. this is usually a supplement for people over 50 or so when their bodies become less effective at producing the enzyme, but you can put your body into overdrive and ensure it's got what it needs to repair what you may have broken, especially if you aren't getting enough of it from the food you eat""  As for the benefits I'm noticing, I wasn't expecting anything, as it was meant to improve overall health. But as the two stars next to it would indicate, I did notice something, which was a lower BP. Noticed this because now sometimes when I stand up I'll get a little lightheaded. Which isn't an issue, but it's an indicator of lower BP. And I don't remember feeling that for months, which would've been when my BP was high (I did take an actual test, of it ofc, not just guessing that it was high. I have not taken m another test though, I must do that when I get the chance!) Also I'm less intolerant of heat. Guessing that relates to BP.  As for magnesium, I've found that it made me wake up feeling just better overall if I took it before sleeping."

StackAdvice,34g1eg,Jack-o-Roses,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:24:17 2015 UTC,100mg pristiq. Olanzapine just 5mg.
StackAdvice,34g1eg,tornados2111,1 point,Fri May 1 00:47:12 2015 UTC,Try lowering the pristiq dosage before you make any major changes. I'd say take half - 75% of a dose and see how you react for a week or so. This could be the cause of the apathy.  Your olanzapine dosage is fairly low already probably not too much of an issue there.

The point should be to use the least effective dose, and the least drugs necessary. Even if something in the stack did work, you wouldn't be able to identify it with all the other stuff you're adding.  And if you have major depression, therapy and SSRI would probably be more effective anyway. If you really want to go the nootropic route, I would suggest starting with some piracetam.

StackAdvice,34en11,seb21051,2,Sun May 3 15:56:44 2015 UTC,"One thing I noticed is that you use Bacopa during the day.  Some of us experience brain fog and sleepiness from this substance, so I would suggest you take it only at night and see if you feel any better during the day.  You should really try each substance on its own for a week, to see what it does for you. I finally did this and found Noopept, Bacopa, Rhodiola and Lions Mane extract made me sleepy, so I moved them to my evening stack.  You could also try a higher dose of melatonin (I take 10-30mg).  Without it I have trouble falling asleep, and then wake up every two hours.  With low doses my PTSD fueled dreams are terrible (vivid dreaming). There are few if any side effects from using higher dosages.  You'll notice if you take too much that you will feel hungover, so then you back off in 5mg steps untill you wake up refreshed.  There are many ways to break your free running and chronic though patterns; meditation is one of them.  Reading, exercise, puzzles, video games, music (listening and playing) could also help.  Remember, doing something with your brain breaks what I call the ""Idling"" compulsions."

I haven't encountered this nootropic yet.  3mg of Melatonin knocks me out pretty well. I'm just scared to use it daily because it might screw up my body. I also don't want to increase tolerance.  I noticed though that when I do play videogames, I get obsessed with them. I play for like 15 hours straight and sometimes don't sleep because I want to finish the game. Then, after I get bored. I voraciously read books, like 5 books in a week or so because I want to get through my reading list fast. Then, I get really anxious. I tried meditating before, but I stop doing it after 2 days.

Anecdotal evidence reports long term use of dosages as high as 75mg. The only side effect I have found personally is a hangover with dosages higher than 40mg.

StackAdvice,34en11,FW900,1 point,Sun May 3 16:01:08 2015 UTC,"Understood!  I have found the answer to dealing with depression, free floating anxiety and PTSD is to slowly build up a structure for every day, to stay mentally and physically occupied.  Make it in small steps, and reward yourself for every step attained.   The big thing is to keep doing that activity at the same time everyday.  In my case I found a first step was to make a daily to-do list. Then, every succeeding day, you review, edit, add, or check off completed items at the same time. It serves a few purposes:   It is something to look forward to, especially checking off the completed items. As you expand the list, you will find your life becoming easier to organize. because you have a visual reminder, which becomes a structure within the larger structure. You further expand it it such that you put times and dates against every item.  There are ones that should be done everyday, or once only, or once a week, or month, or year.   Mine progressed from a simple small notebook, to using MS Outlook, for its extended functionality.  They say if you do something consistently for 3 weeks, it becomes a habit.  So do this exercise for three weeks, so that it becomes automatic, ie you seldom have to think about doing it.  You channel some of you compulsive tendency to help make this a steadfast habit.  To counter depression directly, you develop a mantra to say to yourself as soon as you discover yourself sliding into it.  Something like:  ""I feel myself getting depressed. I will fight it with my positive will""  Say this to yourself for 5, 10 or 20 times. As you get used to the words and intent of the mantra, it becomes easier, and more quickly effective.  You are programming your mind with a technique to counter the negative slide.  I use thus technique technique when I am trying to get to sleep, and my PTSD intrudes to let my memories and imagination conjure up scenes of torture, killing, gore, suffering, etc. which is a precursor for a nightmare filled night and subsequent depression.  You can develop a similar technique for heading off your compulsive drive when it seduces you into activities or that you do not want to stop, such as gaming, reading, fapping continuously, etc.  Create short, easy to remember mantras for each activity, or simply a general anti-compulsive one, to redirect your will power. it can be done."

You will be RUNNING on pills. Nootropics are truly benificial to people who already have some good mental tools, they are not a cure all. If you think taking these pills all day is going to fix you i beleive you will be sadly mistaken.   Going to a therapist certainly isn't a bad idea, and you don't have to be worried about them prescribing you anything. You don't HAVE to take anything you don't want to. I certainly don't think anti depressants are the answer. You need to learn how your brain and consiousness works. I would highly encourage you to persue the behavioral changes you mentioned at the bottom, in particular meditation and exercise, before you start taking 50 pills a day. Meditation and exercise has worked wonders for many people and I'm a firm beleiver that much of depression comes from a misunderstanding of your own thoughts. You need to learn not to identify and give meaning to your negative thoughts. Meditation will help immensly. I have been depressed, i have been suicidal, i have been a horrible student, and i've turned things completely around. Making almost all A's in my masters program (in organic chemistry) and I'm happier and more mentally stable than ever before. I attribute 85% of that to meditation and exercise.   As far as the no-fap, I would encourage you to consider that you are a human being. It is a noble cause to abstain from masturbation if you think it makes you a better person, but it is not worth it if it makes you feel bad about yourself when you give into tempation. If pills take way your sex drive that is a BAD thing. My God, i can't even imagine taking a pill that takes away my sex drive.. You WILL masturbate, and thats ok. Focus on being reasonable with your masturbation rather than cutting it out all together. Regardless of what certain subreddits preach, masturbation is probably NOT your biggest issue.   I know this isn't much in terms of advice about your stack, and thats because I simply don't condone people running on pills. You're a human not a robot.   Good luck."

Assuming for a moment there is similarity between cocaine and fapping as an addiction, and generalizing from piracetam, this might be relevant.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12628617  You might consider spearmint to reduce circulating testosterone. Increasing prolactin levels slightly might also help (Which is used as a measure of satiation after sex, and reduces libido). SSRI's do this. The only other thing I know that can have that effect is vitex agnus in small amounts, maybe 100mg.

StackAdvice,34en11,TrapandRelease,1 point,Sun May 3 20:24:59 2015 UTC,"Trying to adopt a bunch of extreme changes all at once is pretty hard. It can easily lead you to fail at one or two of them, which makes you want to give up everything at once. Gradual changes are a lot easier to handle.  With nootropics in mind, you're stacking a whole boatload of things all at once without really understanding what your problem is. Some of them are just generally good for everyone, so you can add them in (fish oil, vitamin d, multivitamins, magnesium), but a lot of them have varied results. They work for some people, they don't work for others. If you start loading a giant stack and it isn't working or seems edgy for some reason, you won't have any idea which substance is causing the problem. Add one thing at a time or well-understood pairs (e.g., caffeine + l-theanine), give it a week, then add in something more once you understand how your brain likes it.  Since you mention jogging and weight training, I assume you're pretty sedentary. Doing some regular light cardio can make huge psychological changes if you're depressed from lack of activity. I'd highly recommend bringing that in ASAP because it can have profound effects. (I also notice that a lot of people in their mid/late 20s start needing this because their lifestyle was a lot more active until they were 22 or so, and then the office finally caught up with them.)  I recommend vitamins + light exercise for a couple of weeks, THEN check in to see how your mood is and get a blood test. See if you have any basic deficiencies that you are working with. Try to get into a state of good physical health before you move on to taking nootropics. IMO, nootropics are generally for optimization, not to completely address problems.   Re: ""how to meditate"". Set a timer for 10 minutes. Sit still with your spine straight. Relax and don't fidget. Pay attention to your breath. When you notice your attention wander, bring it gently back to your breath. Stop when the timer goes off. That's it.  btw, there are a lot of different types of therapists. Some of them might be gung ho about anti-depressants which I agree is a pretty big stick to address your problems with if you don't make some basic health fixes first. But others are more like coaches and will work with you to improve your habits and thinking styles. One example of a style of therapy like this is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy."

StackAdvice,34en11,TrapandRelease,1 point,Sun May 3 16:10:28 2015 UTC,CBT is performed by a licensed professional counselor (varies from state to state but usually a person with a Master's in a relevant behavioral health field who is board certified in some way). Usually some number of visits are covered under medical insurance with a referral from your doctor. If you tell your doctor about brain fog and depression that should be a pretty easy referral to get. Some employers also offer special coverage for counseling services so it's worth checking to see what's available.  Often no more than a set number of visits are covered but that works pretty well with CBT since it's intended to give you homework and the counselor is more like a coach whose goal is to have less and less frequent checkups with you as you improve.

Based on your description of what you want to do, I would recommend just Ashwagandha regularly, and caffeine/theanine as a stimulant as needed intermittently. Ditch everything else.

I have better luck with lower doses of melatonin (500ug or less).   Just close your eyes for 10 minutes to meditate. 2 things that might help are: start a thankfulness/Gratitude journal.  Write in it & then close your eyes and reflect on what you just wrote. The other thing is to listen to brainwave entrainment soundtracks while you meditate.   Good luck"

I think taking on such a supplementation regiment might mask more severe symptoms if they exist. You should also get blood work done, because there could be other reasons why you're feeling this way.

Klinicki psiholog, Klinicka psihijatrijska bolnica Vrapce, Zagreb, Bolnicka.  The effects of piracetam on cognitive functions have been studied in alcoholic patients. The investigation was carried out on 27 alcoholics who were admitted to hospital with acute withdrawal syndrome. The trial was performed under double-blind condition. Thirteen patients were treated with piracetam and 14 with placebo. The performance of patients treated with piracetam (experimental group) was significantly better at the Block-Design retest, as compared with the control subjects. This was associated with comparatively good perceptual organization, visual motor coordination and abstract reasoning in these patients.

Is it possible there are other factors contributing to your memory issues?  Alcohol primarily causes damage to the brain via excitoxicity during the withdrawal period thanks to increased glutamate activity.   Nimodipine (a calcium channel antagonist) has been shown to help ameliorate alcohol-induced memory loss in a mouse model of alcoholism, but I'm not sure if it would help if you are now essentially abstinent from alcohol.   Magnesium would be a good idea to add to your stack, as magnesium can also block calcium channel activity and has been shown to improve insomnia in recovering alcoholics.

I may try to keep my choline dosing down to ~500 mg per day, and only increase it if I notice headaches when taking piracetam (or after adding antiracetam / noopept)."

StackAdvice,347xgo,HuskerReddit,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:49:44 2015 UTC,"Do you think that taking a B vitamin complex, that includes choline, with the CDP-Choline being set aside unless I feel like I need it after starting with racetams, be a better course of action?  The main reason I have avoided adding a full B complex is because I eat enough dairy, chicken, pork, and/or beef every day to meet the minimum requirements, except for folate maybe...I don't eat enough of the folate heavy leafy vegetables, and I avoid large doses of bread and pasta, as they trigger intestinal problems for me.  I do eat fortified rice quite often, which contains folate, but probably not enough to get an adequate supply.  Anyway, a B complex seemed like overkill, but maybe it would be worthwhile as a source of B12, choline, and folate."
StackAdvice,347xgo,Jack-o-Roses,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:09:35 2015 UTC,"I think it is still definitely worth a shot to try and supplement with the CDP choline. A lot of people say it reduces brain fog and can help with cognition. Just be aware that some people produce enough choline on their own and additional choline has a negative impact.  The choline source in the B vitamin most likely has a very low dose and low bioavailability so is probably negligible.   I could be wrong about this but I don't believe that additional B vitamins will do any harm. From what I've heard is that any B vitamins that aren't used are just excreted through your urine, which is what makes your urine a neon/yellow color."

StackAdvice,344tu9,hot_rats_,3,Tue Apr 28 11:21:50 2015 UTC,"Describing yourself as having an addictive personality + taking phenibut to ""feel"" it = recipe for disaster.  Low therapeutic doses (<400mg) of phenibut are great for raising brain GABA levels, which can help with sleep and adrenal issues. But you're not going to feel it after the first dose or two. And the feeling is quite enjoyable, so if you have the tendency to chase it, you'll be into high recreational doses in no time, which will be followed by a debilitating soul-crushing withdrawal.  If you are disciplined it does work well; you just need to maintain the utmost respect for this substance.  L-theanine is not exactly the same effects. Not as powerful of a drug but much safer. It is a good anxiolytic, often paired with caffeine, but I find it to be a bit too dulling for my liking. Definitely worth a try though."

It started out being so sedating that I had to take it before bed and I slept great on it. But after about 5 days, I noticed that my sleep quality was declining so I switched the l-theanine to the morning with caffeine and wow, it was like my days were so much better. Calm, focused, motivated. That extreme effect has subsided into a level amount of clarity and focus that I don't particularly notice, but is there and I look forward to my dosing in the morning and mid-day. Its effects have become somewhat stimulating for me, to the point where I can start my some of my days with only l-theanine and no caffeine, and feel motivated to get work done in the office.   Haven't tried phenibut but I did just order some.

I'm not gonna tell you not to buy nootropics, but from my experience I've wasted a lot of money (unfortunately a bit over $400 because I even tried TruBrain) and I never really noticed anything. I'm the type to fall into placebo too, but really all I've been thinking throughout every nootropic I've taken is ""I really hope this is doing something.""  Piracetam without choline gives me a headache. Piracetam with choline removes the headache and does nothing else but make me wonder if something's happening.  Honestly the most beneficial nootropics in my experience are Bacopa and L-Theanine. Whenever I take bacopa at night I have some intense, vivid dreams (sometimes really hot ones if you're into that. Never hurts y'know). It also really improves my memory, not so sure about focus. L-Theanine saved me from failing my drivers license test. Normally I'd freak out and drive at 20mph in a residential area because I don't wanna kill anyone, but with L-Theanine I kept my cool and didn't freak out.

Compared with oral administration, buccal administration may provide better bioavailability of some drugs and a more rapid onset of action because the medication does not pass through the digestive system and thereby avoids first pass metabolism.   As of May 2014, buccal forms of the psychiatric drug, asenapine; the opioid drugs buprenorphine, naloxone, and fentanyl; the cardiovascular drug nitroglycerin; the nausea medication Prochlorperazine; the hormone replacement therapy testosterone, and nicotine as a smoking cessation aid, were commercially available in buccal forms,   as was midazolam, an anticonvulsant, used to treat acute epileptic seizures.   Buccal administration of vaccines has been studied, but there are challenges to this approach due to immune tolerance mechanisms that prevent the body from over-reacting to immunogens encountered in the course of daily life.

An evenly broken up dose desolves more quickly, so get it nice and fine.  Once your happy with it, just pull off the sticky note, which should be a V channel shape from when you folded it earlier, and put it up to your face and give it a couple taps to slide the noopept off of it, under your tongue.  Then cover up the taste with some kind of juice, because it tastes like death.  that's the best way I've found to take it, but putting it in tiny gel-caps might work.  Also, getting a tiny tablet dye and pressing your own noopept/sugar tablets might work well too.  I've never tried either of these though.  Also do you mean Choline?  A Choline source isn't generally required with noopept, but if you want to take it, you can probably just gel-cap it.

StackAdvice,33v3v3,nuxeon,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:33:31 2015 UTC,It's about $15-$18 for 1000 caps before S&H so not too expensive. The biggest expense will be the time it takes to make the caps. If you have to measure out the weight for each individual cap (for noopept as an example) it can take a long time. If you are just filling each cap to its capacity (piracetam for example) its very quick. I can usually do 400 at 50 per batch in about 2 hours. It does take a fair bit of time but I just can't get past the taste of most nootropics.

While with many substances, aniracetam included, more rigorous research could be done (better sample size, more peer review, testing on healthy individuals) to narrow the specific effects and how much of a benefit healthy individuals could obtain, there is enough science to tentatively come to a conclusion without saying it's ""more of a placebo."" (A tentative conclusion means ""this is interesting lets do more research to be ABSOLUTELY maybe nearly sure"")  It's not as big of a cognitive boost as some might want, nor as good as the placebo effect it may seem to some, but that also doesn't mean there is no effect at all.

I suggest doing your own research like reading the beginner's wiki in /r/Nootropics and using examine.com rather than asking broad, complex questions with randos feeding you anecdotal information. Once you kind of know what's going on, then come and ask questions. Nootropics can be a rabbit hole that you have to explore yourself rather than having it fed to you. This is because everyone is so different. There is no one size fits all sort of thing.

There are several ways in which it contributes to the treatment of and protection against liver disease. First, cordyceps has a potential enhancing effect on the immunological function of patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B (Gong, Wang, and Tang 2000) and from posthepatic cirrhosis (Zhu and Liu 1992). Second, cordyceps was shown to inhibit and reverse liver fibrosis via degradation of collagen in rats with liver cirrhosis induced by dimethylnitrosamine (Li et al. 2006a; Wang, Liu, and Tang 2008), inhibit proliferation of hepatic stellate cells in vitro (Chor et al. 2005), downregulate intercellular adhesion molecule-I (an index of liver fibrogenesis) and CD126 in human fibroblasts (Li and Tsim 2004), and decrease expression of transforming growth factor-β and platelet-driven growth factor (Liu and Shen 2003). Third, cordyceps decreased lipid peroxide levels in serum and hepatic tissue, and lowered serum TNF-α in bacillus calmette guerin plus LPS-induced liver injury in mice (Zeng, Tang, and Yuan 2001)."

StackAdvice,33l9xy,synaesthetic,2,Thu Apr 23 15:10:16 2015 UTC,"I've been taking it orally for 2 years now. I'm using it to treat non 24 hour sleep phase disorder (Me and my doctors are confused about why it works to fix this but it seems to do it very well, hopefully going to get in touch with the local circadian neuroscience lab to find out after I finish uni). As for tolerance I'd say no, it's been very sustainable over the time I've been using it, I use Aniracetam to control the side effects but that does slightly impact it's effect on energy.   What you wrote reminds me of when I was in my first year at university and I was abusing pseudoephidrine to get through my exams/do essays, particularly the cold symptoms after use. I've not had any similar experiences with Reboxetine, I'd suspect that's because while it sensitises the receptors it keeps the level of NE relatively constant, so rather than feeling peaks and troughs like you do with stimulants you have a more subtle but reliable boost in energy without the downturns. That's just my N=1 experience though, if you were interested in this sort of thing i'd take a look at Atomoxetine or Reboxetine and see if they agree with you, if they don't it's worth pairing them with a Racetam to see if that makes things better."

You say depression/anxiety has been mostly dealt with, but I've been in situations where my mood and anxiety levels are OK, but I'm still jacked up on adrenaline from hypervigilance.   Do you always notice everything around you? Always play out hypothetical situations? Get paranoid about things? Get irritable/agitated when trying to accomplish something? etc.  I've started taking Prazosin for PTSD, and it's helped me quite a bit in terms of sleep quality. My dreams aren't as intense, and I don't wake up sweating from the more intense/nightmareish dreams I have. All Prazosin does is lower norepinephrine levels, basically, causing your CNS to not be jacked up all the time. In that sense, it's a bit of an ""inverse nootropic"" to me, since lower NE levels generally means less energy/concentration, but because I'm not panicking or freaking out as much, I can recover quicker from stress, sleep better, and have more mental energy for things that actually matter.  If Prazosin is a bit extreme for you, I'd look at your supplements and see which ones have effects on norepinephrine. Do they raise it? Lower it? Modulate it in some way? For instance, stuff like Ginkgo Biloba is used for its neuroprotective properties against chronic stress, but it still raises norepinephrine, which leaves me feeling jacked up.  Sorry I can't be more specific. I went through the whole gauntlet of supplements and none really worked for the ultra-intense-dreams problem."

Of course, before buying I will do my own research on everything to ensure that it's safe but I just have a couple of questions.  Any reason you chose this choline source over any other or is this just the cheapest?  I'm already taking omega-3 fish oil with DHA and EPA. Does the amount of this matter do you think or just 1000mg of any omega-3?  I have been suggested to use adrafinil for energy and motivation but some responses are a bit varied, some saying it is barely perceivable all the way up to being a huge huge help with being able to keep working on a task (and I don't know how much this may help me considering my focus is quite good). Also it is quite expensive and has health problems with it. Your stack is cheaper (considering I'm already taking bacopa, instead of lion's mane and I'm taking fish oil) and the rest of the stuff is really cheap. Have you ever used adrafinil and if so what have your experiences so far been?"
StackAdvice,33fght,apple-crisp,2,Fri Apr 24 06:37:15 2015 UTC,"Not a problem. The reason why I prefer centrophenoxine as a choline source is because it seems to have a synergistic effect on the stack. It's hard to describe, but it gave me this 'clean energy' feeling and it lifted up my mood. Other choline sources I tried were Alpha GPC and Phosphatidyl Choline, but I felt they didn't do much for me, except made me feel ""bleh"" and irritable. But don't take my word for it because everyone reacts differently to noots.   As for the omega-3 fish oil, I don't think it matters how much you take. You can take more or less than 1000 mg depending on your preference. I've heard some people taking up to 7000mg or 8000mg a day in order to really feel the effects. I don't know, but that seems a bit overkill to me.  And finally, I've never taken adrafinil because of the side effect; it can potentially cause liver damage. Um....no thanks. I tend to avoid it."

Caffeine, or extra caffeine if you're already using. Good substitute. Can always wean down from this later also. Tyrosine, or N-acetyl-l-tyrosine, as others mentioned. For first week or so, depending on what else you utilize (tyrosine would seem to exhibit tolerance eventually). Rhodiola - fairly mild but would highly recommend. Decent for mood and energy. Phenylpiracetam - said to feel quite ""stimulant-like,"" though milder, and believed to be a moderate dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Cardio - over time can be quite energizing, mentally and physically. Start gradual if you're not already doing it very consistently or are ""out of shape"" like me.   Note: Any combination of the above can be probably be combined and/or used interchangeably. Items below might not be best used with all those above or with one another (might be too much), but using with some of the above should be ok, if done wisely.

I've never used it for fighting amphetamine withdrawal, though, but it should definitely help. Adding noopept into the equation  was even more stimulating, but the effects for that combo plateaued at around the 4th day of use. I'm not sure if the sulbutiamine would have continued being just as effective after that, but it's generally agreed that the stuff maintains reasonable potency for about a week.  You'll definitely want to supplement with a B-vitamin complex, since your adrenals will probably flip out without the constant stimulation they're used to dealing with. Get in some cardio exercise during the withdrawal, if you can, as it encourages neuroplasticity, which is what you'll be wanting to boost while this happens.  CDP choline or uridine monophosphate will help your brain increase DA receptor density, but that will happen over months: still, it wouldn't hurt to get started if you want to feel like you never depended on something like an amphetamine (I certainly do)."

I am no chemistry freak, so I don't know if I can assume they are the same but one just has magnesium with it. I assume that's good, because magnesium is something needed for the nervous system. Also, epsom salts baths is not something that is available on powdercity, so I wouldn't want to go for it unless it is truely exceptional. What's the difference between that and glycinate? Do either of these have tolerance issues if used daily?   The melatonin does seem very tempting, with a dose cost of less than half of a cent. I'm wondering if it actually increases sleep quality, or just gets you to sleep? This is important to me, because actually I do meditate and I find that I fall asleep really quickly and I sleep more than an average person (about 8-9 hours) yet sometimes I don't feel entirely rested, which glycine claims to solve in many people. If you have any experience, I'd love to hear.  As for f.lux, that's very interesting and I've just downloaded it.  As for herbs, I do have valerian extract but I don't really like it so much. I find that it gets me to sleep if I need it but can't from stress, but I usually actually feel like I haven't gotten enough sleep the next morning and I don't find it to actually make my sleep any better so I am a little bit skeptical about how this is something that could help me, especially since I don't really have huge problems with sleep"
StackAdvice,33d56e,tornados2111,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:58:12 2015 UTC,Never taken glycine by itself. Magnesium helps one relax.  It is absorbed well dermally:that is why a bath with a few cups of Epsom salts works so well....  You can buy Epsom salts in most pharmacies.   Melatonin definitely helps with sleep quality.

StackAdvice,33csx8,wannagetbaked,3,Tue Apr 21 14:09:01 2015 UTC,"For a start, you'll definitely want to take some taurine at some point, as it will support the vascular system, which suffers on adderall. CoQ10 wouldn't hurt either.  As for things that potentiate/work well with it, you want to start by knowing what to avoid. This is one of the most comprehensive posts I've seen on the subject, and any instructions from it that I've followed have worked.  Amphetamine is very alkaline: taking an antacid with your morning adderall dose prevents your stomache acids from wreaking havoc on the molecule and gets more of it into your system. Avoiding vitamin c during the day also helps (although taking it at night should help prevent the related insomnia).  Be careful about stacking the racetams: high doses of both is extremely intense and, in my experience, excitotoxic. I generally only enjoy a combination of these in very low doses.  Exercise also makes the high smoother, the sleep better, and reduces any crash.  There are some great recreational stacks, but I don't feel like encouraging any of them publicly."

Just make sure you get a good quality extract like bacognize (available on swanson/vitacost) or synapsa.   Pairing l-theanine with caffeine in addition to this is pretty standard.

I was doing a bit of research, and it seems like some people have had some anecdotal success with some of the racetams; oxiracetam seems like a popular choice for memory improvement. Would you recommend taking that or possibly another racetam?   Also, what's your opinion on IDRA-21? Based on (again) anecdotal reports, it sounds like it might be effective for enhancing memory as well as focus/concentration.

While I'm sure they have some effect, it's not understood how useful it would be in practice and whether or not it should be used during acquisition/learning or only at recall.     The racetams either have mostly no research to show they would enhance a healthy human (only benefits to disease/decline).  So people's use is kinda experimental and there are a lot of reports out there which could just be placebo or false reviews to drive sales.  If you want an overview of the research behind them, I suggest looking at the examine.com entries.  IDRA-21: Has never been studied in humans.  A good rule of thumb to skip.  Research was halted in primates and we don't know why.  Basically a 'research chemical' until it's studied further. .  Bacopa would be the reliable choice for enhancing memory based on the evidence.     anecdotal reports, it sounds like it might be effective   When there's no evidence, you can't really look at the anecdotes to determine if it's effective.    If you have Adderall, you're now in possession of one of the most motivating substances there is - nothing here can come close to it.  If it's useful, you still have to manage your use and time wisely, as overuse or using it to cram when you should be sleeping is just going to be counterproductive.  Sleep is pretty important.   I probably won't have time to meditate.   You know you can meditate anywhere and for any length of time.

StackAdvice,336dxr,musicman4534,2,Mon Apr 20 19:07:51 2015 UTC,I started Luvox at a low dose(50 mg) on April 10th along with Seroquel. April 17th is when I added the other stuff and increased the dose of Luvox and Seroquel. Seroquel is great as a sleep aid. I am still waiting for the other things to kick in. I might increase the Luvox dose to 150 mg this Friday.
StackAdvice,336dxr,bordism,3,Mon Apr 20 19:24:37 2015 UTC,"From what I can see, neither memantine nor NAC compete with the luvox and seroquel, which is great, because the studies and anecdotes for memantine and NAC are promising. You're stack looks good - see what happens in the following weeks!  I usually don't agree with the use of SSRIs, but it's different when it comes to OCD. Sustained use of specific SSRIs, like Fluvoxamine, has been shown to actually shrink the region of the brain that over-fires in people with OCD, so taking a low dose of luvox for a sustained amount of time and then getting off of it eventually will be most beneficial IMO.  Edited Addition on medicine in general:  These compounds are undoubtedly modifying the chemistry of your brain; something you can do to help their effectiveness is to remain mindful throughout the day.  A placebo effect is created by one's consciousness, so a double-blind study is utilized to weed out the various placebo effects in order to find the effects of the drug itself. When a person takes a drug with already-proven effects, the double-blind study is reversed... The patient, in order to maximize the effects of his or her treatment, should align his or her willpower with his or her treatment goals and medicine.  Mindfulness, which is what creates and breaks habits, shapes our brains even without any drugs, so work with your medicine by remaining mindful of your actions, and even try to fit mindfulness meditation into your life. You working toward changing your mind along with these compounds will have the most dramatic effect. Working against them by letting your actions run wild more than usual will hinder them. The goal is to have a life free of OCD, so work toward it. The compounds you're taking are tools, not crutches, so use them as long as you need them (which may be a long time or may be a short time, doesn't matter as long as you are mindful of how you feel) and work with them for your own good."

I was only using the stuff occasionally, though, because I had received a small free sample of the stuff. The stimulation was cleaner than phenylpiracetam but short-lived and with a crash.  Honestly, I'm trying Noopept (5mg intranasal BID) and Sulbutiamine (~300mg orally BID) for the second day in a row, and it is achieving an energy level similar to that of phenylpiracetam, although I've heard sulbutiamine can only be cycled for about a week with efficacy. I intend to see it through until the effect starts to lessen, myself.  But, being that amped all of the time isn't giving your endogenous system enough credit, and likely wont be sustainable or desirable over an extended amount of time, even by cycling different stims with different MOAs. It's much better to accept that these drugs are for shorter periods of time.  If, on the other hand, you want to enhance your energy levels by maximizing your bioenergetic potential, exercise, a very comprehensive B-vitamin complex, exercise, CoQ10, PQQ, creatine, and exercise will get you places. The places you get will depend on your own physical input, though, far more than your supplemental input (although CoQ10 is awesome, as are good B-vitamin supplements: I use Max-B Complex by Premier Research labs).

StackAdvice,32wjcu,socialstapler,2,Fri Apr 17 12:09:39 2015 UTC,Tianeptine sulfate will help with depressive symptoms and makes it easier to get work done.
StackAdvice,32wjcu,tornados2111,2,Sun Apr 19 00:38:01 2015 UTC,I am not very experienced with nootropics but I would recommend trying out meditation at /r/meditation.

StackAdvice,32wjcu,shrillthrill,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:00:41 2015 UTC,I'm thinking about taking something card tianeptine. Reading the reviews and what people were experiencing and how it helped them through those issues really seems promising. I think it would be great to start with. Anything else to take in conjunction to this?
StackAdvice,32wjcu,shrillthrill,2,Fri Apr 17 08:34:05 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest trying calm aid (/r/nootropics/wiki/lavender) as the safety profile is better than tianeptine.   It's been shown effective for anxiety, generally kicks in within 10-15 mins.  Available on Amazon, vitacost, iherb.  In my experience in reduces the intrusive thoughts that are associated with anxiety and makes things doable.  Picking up 1mg melatonin tablets to take in the evening before bed should help urge you to sleep before midnight.  Normal waking hours and morning sunlight should help with your fitness goal."
StackAdvice,32wjcu,shrillthrill,2,Fri Apr 17 08:50:57 2015 UTC,"Do you mean this? There are some mixed reviews, I'll do a little more research on the stack. What's wrong with tianeptine's profile? Does it have harsh side effects or something?"
StackAdvice,32wjcu,shrillthrill,1 point,Fri Apr 17 11:30:10 2015 UTC,"Yep that's it.  Reviews are mixed sure, it may not solve everyone's issues, but the linked evidence is quite promising for GAD.    Tianeptine, if dosed improperly can lead to serious dependence and withdrawal issues.  Tianeptine powder can accumulate moisture from the air which can lead to measuring errors.  Ceretropic does sell it in dropper form which helps avoid these issues, but it comes at a price.  It shouldn't be used with a history of alcohol problems or liver issues."
StackAdvice,32wjcu,shrillthrill,1 point,Fri Apr 17 11:36:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just read that Tianeptine is pretty harsh on the liver. I don't drink which is a good thing, imagine how worse my situation could possibly be if I was a depressed alcoholic? Wouldn't be good! But yeah it seems pretty tricky when it comes to measuring it and then scaling it and putting it into a capsule. It might be worth the hassle though. The first review says   Note this is mildly hydrophobic so you will have difficulty mixing it into water. It will definitely not mix into solution so you must measure each dose individually with a scale. I recommend getting capsules for it. I have trialed it at 40 mg, and found it to be MUCH better than the older Sodium form. It lasted about 6 hours, and had no strong comeup/down (it just smoothly wore off over maybe 45 minutes towards the end). No dysphoria or crash towards the end. I found it's effects to be very therapeutic; it did not give me a buzz/constant good mood, but made me less anxious and more positive. It seemed to help me slow down slightly mentally and be a bit more objective, as well as reduced muscle tension. My advice is to not chase a buzz with this. Don't use it to keep you constantly in a sunny mood, use it to help with anxiety/depression. Don't push the doses up to keep constantly feeling it; trust that it's working in the background just like Ritalin is supposed to. If you really feel you have tolerance to every benefit, take a break instead of doubling the dose. Roughly 40-50 mg should be effective for 6 hours, so you may need a second dose later in the day, but try with just one to see. Probably not the best idea to combine with alcohol as it seems to be a bit hard on the liver. Speaking of which, if you plan to use it for more than a month consecutively, I'd get your liver enzymes checked to make sure you're not one of the people vulnerable to a negative reaction. Adverse reactions are rare and usually reverse following cessation, but still it's best to be cautious. All in all it's a great improvement over the Sodium version; the sodium version seems to barely last 2 hours whereas this one easily pulls 6 and is way more comfortable.<   Do you agree with this advice?"
StackAdvice,32wjcu,whoisbambam,3,Fri Apr 17 11:58:52 2015 UTC,"The recommended dose is 12.5mg x3, spread out through the day, morning, midday, evening.  So that person is giving out incorrect advice which could lead towards dependence.    It's really a good idea to be accurate with such a drug, which requires a milligram scale (~$20), but small doses are difficult to measure accurately (may be off by a few mg either direction) and accurate scales are too expensive.    I still think you might benefit more from trying the calmaid first.  I was skeptical of it at first but have been surprised at how effective it's been."
StackAdvice,32wjcu,whoisbambam,2,Fri Apr 17 12:13:29 2015 UTC,"Great thanks for the information. I read two reviews of the calmaid where they experienced a really abnormal, fast heart rate. That's what initially threw me off. Anything that will possibly lead to cardiac arrest or tampers with the integrity of the heart is a no go for me. How long did you try the calmaid for? Is it 1 pill a day for 30 days? Did you notice a change in mood/behavior after the first few days?"
StackAdvice,32wjcu,shrillthrill,3,Fri Apr 17 12:16:43 2015 UTC,"Sometimes when people take new drugs they experience anxiety.  Even different coloured placebo pills have been shown to affect people differently.  I wouldn't have any concerns with heart health.  If anything, being more relaxed will lead to a slightly lower heart rate which is healthier.  I've used calmaid over the past 4 months as needed.  Up to twice a day, but up to 8 hours apart as it seems to keep me calm for long enough.  The studies have tested the twice the dose (2 pills) that calmaid provides per pill - so taking it more than once in a day seems safe.  I, my girlfriend, and another friend have all noticed a change in mood within 10-15 minutes - basically as long as it takes for the capsule to burst in the stomach it gets quickly absorbed.  So, it's been immediately useful to take before situations, but we've also found it to be useful to positively influence mood after something upsetting has happened."
StackAdvice,32wjcu,shrillthrill,2,Fri Apr 17 12:25:55 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I can definitely relate to that feeling, I had that happen a few times after trying out a new pre-workout for the gym. It felt as if my heart was going to pop out of my chest but after a few sets I chilled out and everything went back to normal.   So is the calmaid most beneficial as a situation suppressor? Would it be beneficial to take while I'm just sitting on my computer with nothing really going through my mind? This is where my lack of motivation stems from, being home all day and doing absolutely nothing. I feel like the calmaid might make me a little lazier.I really want something to kick my ass, wake me up and force me to go outside, face my fears, apply for work, and not be confined to my apartment. And no, I will not do cocaine :P"

StackAdvice,32w9d1,Jackolysis,2,Fri Apr 17 16:00:35 2015 UTC,"I've enjoyed 1.3 g without caffeine. I would definitely recommend taking the phenibut on an empty stomach, with an antacid, and waiting about 30 mins before stacking anything else with it, so that you make sure it has entered the small intestine. Phenibut is strongly acidic and can cause a stomach upset in a lot of people for no other reason than the pH drop it causes.  I would definitely gauge how you feel after taking the phenibut and letting it kick in (you'll have a good idea at 2.5 hrs). You'd be surprised how stimulating it can be (some people--including myself--have a running theory that a portion of the drug is metabolized into an analogue of methylphenidate) and also how good you might already feel without stacking ethanol or other recreational drugs on top of it. I've had a bad week before following a phenibut dose because I was stacking too much with it and I think my brain tried to overwhelmingly compensate, and trust me, you don't want your brain to think it needs to compensate for a GABA imbalance, unless you like being depressed and anxious.  I guess you could take a lower dose and mix it with other things, but it really is a wonderful drug by itself. Considering how rarely it has to be taken, I would give it the center spotlight and then shelf it for a month while you enjoy your other vices."

StackAdvice,32sht9,sonic_rukai,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:00:42 2015 UTC,What's the dosage for bacopa and ashwagandha?
StackAdvice,32sht9,Linclin,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:16:56 2015 UTC,"Bacopa dosage is 150 mg bacosides (not total weight since bacosides vary from 20-50% of bacopa so 750mg of 20% = 150 mg bacosides = 1 days dose) ashwagandha dosage varies a lot between people 150 mg - 6000 mg per day. 700 mg per day total of ashwagandha makes me very tired and lethargic. I take about 350 mg of 45% bacopa every day and don't really find it relaxing but it has greatly improved my working memory and probably my executive functioning. My initial working memory/executive function were impaired so I don't know how much improvement a regular person would get. Bacopa isn't for everyone and can cause sleepiness, depression, stomach problems, etc... I would try them separately maybe using bacopa last and see how you feel/react. They might give you anxiety/anger which happens to a few people. Maybe look at L-theanine for staying calm."

StackAdvice,32r0yn,barondemerxhausen,7,Thu Apr 16 00:45:12 2015 UTC,"I would let the doctors handle the drugs, while you try to handle nutrition and reversing metabolic dysfunction.  A ketogenic diet could definitely be worth a shot, though getting that done when neither of you may are committed to it would be a challenge. Dementias in general may have a lot to do with poor insulin sensitivity in the brain, which leads to a lack of metabolic function and the subsequent plaques. If you can address that, by have the brain use ketone bodies instead of glucose primarily, then that could boost metabolic function.  Another way to possibly increase insulin sensitivity is by taking fairly large doses (1-2 grams) of b3 (specifically nicotinamide or nicotinamide riboside). NAD decreases with age and certain transcriptional factors (sirtuins) may down regulate as a result. Boosting NAD with those precursors (nicotinamide or nicotinamide ribosid) could increase the metabolic status of the brain and help the brain maintain function.  MTC oil or coconut oil. This is a quick way to get a low-level ketosis going, if a full ketogenic diet is too much.  Other nutrients: Creatine (general metabolic booster, also may decrease the strain on methyl groups by supplementing it instead of needing to synthesize it) coq10, B-vitamin complex, cdp-choline.  Current drugs aren't very promising long-term they don't really do anything to address the pathology. Typically they buy people a few years a lucidity, I wouldn't solely rely on them.  Edit: Note:  Long term nicotinamide supplementation may increase fasting blood glucose for some people, so you'd want to test that regularly or only take it acutely."

I'd either go with Nutrex or Healthy Origins (both available on vitacost/iherb, which ship to Australia for ~$4-12 and in 8-14 days in my experience).  The Australian supplement market is kinda crummy when it comes to quality control, except for perhaps fish oil (woolworths macro brand seems like a reasonable bet though).  Fresh Blueberries if you want to avoid the risks of the frozen imported ones.  A good quality green tea (Dilmah sells some decent oolong) as a source of l-theanine, if she enjoys green tea.  If not, you could always just opt for some l-theanine as supplement.  10g of dark chocolate (e.g. a square of Lindt 70/85/90%) has a variety of potential health benefits, while nothing too strong for Alzheimer's, I'd say it's worth it for general health.  edit: Walnuts are another dietary intervention.

While it definitely can not reverse the disease, it can help overcome the impaired glucose utilization, and help against further neurodegeneration.  Do not bother adding coconut oil or MCT oil to a high carb diet because it is pointless. You need several weeks worth of keto-adaptation for ketones to be of any use.

You probably don't need both of these - choose one or the other. I would recommend GPC choline, along with one of the racetams: piracetam (cheapest), aniracetam (best for anxiety), oxiracteam or phenylpiracetam (noticeable effect but tolerance develops).  I have used Bacopa and didn't really get much out of it. Others seem to like it.   I have no experience with Mucuna Pruriens to can't comment.   GABA alone has poor bioavailability.

I stopped taking it because although it was stimulating me, it was causing noticeable brain fog and short-term memory loss. To the point where I'd hear something for the ""first time"" and my fiancee would get super pissed off because we had just talked about it the day before. I'd have no recollection of the conversation even after being told that.   From what I've read, it's a common side-effect of noopept and especially with taking too much. I never weighed it out but instead used the little red micro scoops it came with. It's such a clumpy consistency that I would imagine that my little scooper gave me doses anywhere from 10mg to 20mg. But that's just rough speculation. I've switched to just taking 1g of piracetam twice per day along with my stack of supplements and noots.   Be prepared to dose several times per day. I had noticed that if I went ~4 hours without dosing again, I would start to fall into a mental slump. Also remember that every experience you read is just one person's experience and even though it's a peptide, it's similar in action to a racetam and they affect everyone differently. So don't get scared off from my personal experience. Give it a try and make sure to grab a good source of choline (I take Alpha GPC daily) unless you eat a bunch of eggs (barf).

Magnesium Glycinate and Melatonin were also good suggestions.  If it was TBI, I would make sure to have a blood test done to establish B12 and Vitamin D levels are sufficient.

StackAdvice,32elkv,midnightjoker,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:21:34 2015 UTC,Prozac has a ton of negative side events. Some of them really blow.  It is most definitely not a nootropic.  5htp might help but it's not a solution.
StackAdvice,32elkv,Jack-o-Roses,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:46:19 2015 UTC,"I would agree with others that SSRIs are a potential commitment. Even if they do help they can cause dependency or continued use to avoid relapse, and with time they often lose their effectiveness, despite the significant side effects being sustained. But, this is not the case for everyone of course. I am at least glad that your doctor is prescribing a low dose, too, which is definitely the right way to start. However, I would recommend first trying tianeptine (which can be beneficial for depression and anxiety as well as IBS) or kanna/sceletium as Jack-o-Roses suggested since it is an herbal SRI (and mild phosphdiesterase IV inhibitor) and possibly more manageable and effective. And he seems to have found it more effective. ... And then you can always try an SSRI later if you feel the need.  Also, not that important but I would consider using tryptophan in place of 5-htp if you're gonna go that route, as it is supposed to avoid the potential cardiotoxic effects of 5-htp and I found it to be more effective (though it is also more expensive). Just don't take it with too much protein or certain other amino acids BC they compete for uptake into the brain and it will have less effect."

I have had similar problems my self, and for me it was my genetics.  look in to this: http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1rz29s/the_methylation_cycle_methylation_analysis_and/  for example, a mao mutation is called the warrior gene, and it can lead to aggression. CBS mutations can lead to elevated b6 and anxiety.   continuing the example, if it was cbs mutation, you would need Boron molybdenum b12 and e and would benefit from a low meat diet... and you would have to limit b6, and doing so would eliminate the anxiety or at least get it under your control.   its complicated, its a lot to understand, but its been worth it for me. the other thing i have to say is... avoid porn and start lifting... these things will help with talking to girls in real life.  lastly phenibute is not something to mess around with, if you dont know what you are doing, and you don't. no offense, not yet you dont... but you can learn.  so look into the methylation stuff... if you want some safer alternatives to phenibute...try googling some of these, they all work in safer ways but do similar things.  kava kava, hops, skull cap, Valerian, passion flower, jujube ziziphus, skull cap, mugwort."

StackAdvice,32djin,bordism,0,Sun Apr 12 23:29:40 2015 UTC,Language changes for instance the used definition of nootropic has changed greatly to encompass all congnitive enhancing drugs.

For instance Examine used the term supplementing piracetam. Supplement has come to mean well tolerated drug in many cases.  Lets say you are 80 years old. Piracetam might be beneficial considering cognitive decline is basically expected at that point. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone not at risk.

I try to eat some fresh fruits/vegetables/salad, but admittedly not much currently, that's something I'm looking to change.  My sleep is ok, sometimes I wake up because my neighbours are screaming, but I'm sleeping well in general.  I did try meditation in the past, it didn't seem to do much good for me to be honest.  As for exercise, for a long time I exercised 3-4 hours a  day, I was also trying to combat my problems that way, but as I wrote, while it was great for my body, it didn't help my brain at all. I'm currently not exercising because I had a few injuries and I didn't see a difference in my mental abilities when I was exercising.  I believe that I ""fried""/""burned through"" some part of my brain because of drugs or do have brain trauma because of the accident or all of that mixed together, possibly I also had something similar to a stroke when I was on one of my trips.  I know that I'm far away from normal and that it's years later now and the best years of my life are being lost makes it all the more frustrating.

StackAdvice,327m9z,Jackolysis,2,Sat Apr 11 20:31:15 2015 UTC,I have had great experience with kanna (sceletium tortuosum).

StackAdvice,327m9z,Jack-o-Roses,1 point,Sun Apr 12 23:44:47 2015 UTC,Oh another thought in passing since you talked about enhancing serotonin transmission. There has been some studies where SSRIS and NSAIDs when taken together become more effective in treating depression. Not quite what you were looking for but similar.   Also note it will be dependent upon which SSRI and NSAID are taken together for why it's more effective. If you consider going this route always a good idea to talk with a doctor about dosing and what not.
StackAdvice,327m9z,cryoAnon,1 point,Sat Apr 11 18:57:07 2015 UTC,"5-htp typically increases levels of serotonin by providing more material from which it may be synthesized. It's a completely separate mechanism, and 5-htp has a long record of efficacy and tolerability."
StackAdvice,327m9z,HospitalDiversionist,1 point,Sun Apr 12 05:03:28 2015 UTC,"MDMA causes a massive release of serotonin as well as dopamine (and norepinephrine I think?) into the synapse. We are far from the point of being able to sustain this sort of state (without diminishing returns, neurotoxicity, and negative effects including depression), unfortunately, and feeling good/euthymic/not-depressed from MDMA does not at all necessitate that you have a problem with inadequate serotonin transmission or that increasing it more will be beneficial overall. The emotional flattening and libido reduction are a result of the sustained activation of your serotonin receptors. So the problem is not that SSRIs do not increase serotonin sufficiently. There are selective serotonin releasers that exist (e.g. phentermine I think?), but they are harmful to the heart and would probably eventually have similar effects and side effects as SRIs.  One option would be to combine a properly dopaminergic substance or stimulant with an SSRI, but this is still tricky, results in tolerance and side effects, and will ultimately lead to significantly altering your homeostatic setpoints (so to speak). So it's a trade-off and a difficult question to weigh for yourself. Whatever you do, I would advise using the lowest possible dose that is effective.  There is one medication I know of that increases serotonin transmission even more than SSRIs (in addition to other neurotransmitter systems), and that is the MAO inhibitor Nardil. I have used it for some time. But of course that is a greater commitment than even an SSRI, and wouldn't recommend except in serious and difficult-to-treat cases."

Next was tumeric curcumin, 5htp, going to bed well hydrated, and not eating much at night.   At the time, I was launching a company and working 60 hours a week in my regular job, so I just needed to be better. I ended up getting about 4.5-5.5 hours as my optimal during the year that I used it. 2 years later, my life is remarkably more chill, so I sleep from midnight to 5am some days, and from 4am till noon on other days.   I still use the SleepBot app to track it and to make sure I maximize sleep cycle effectiveness even though I can sleep as much as I want.

Try higher doses of L-theanine, or something else that the body can regulate. The long action of phenibut makes it one of the most tolerance-inducing of all GABA agonists.

Example: I have had several days of ""life"" time and now I need to get some work/errands done. I hate waking up and thinking of all the shit I have to do, and also having no momentum from a few days of sloth. So, When I just need to zerg through shit, I commit my mind mentally to being miserable, take the racetams, and get started accomplishing tiny wins.

StackAdvice,322jrj,sonic_rukai,3,Fri Apr 10 03:03:09 2015 UTC,A good way to get around that is taking the L-theanine at night until your body has attenuated to it (if it isn't too close to bedtime you should notice any lethargy before sleep).  You'll get some real quality sleep while you're at it.
StackAdvice,322jrj,Debonaire_Death,2,Fri Apr 10 14:11:25 2015 UTC,"Yep. This is exactly what I did until I started noticing problems with my sleep. Like I'd wake up in the middle of the night ready to be awake. At that point, I started taking it in the morning with my caffeine and it's been amazing ever since."
StackAdvice,322jrj,sonic_rukai,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:10:05 2015 UTC,"Okay, how often do you take the l-Theanine and how much? I could see myself using about that much caffeine daily. And I'd hardly call myself addicted, but I can understand if it's caused some changes in there. I've seen people in here recommend kratom, is this just kindling the fires or is there any other benefits to kratom? Also, with tianeptine, I understand it's a full mu-opioid agonist but what in it contributes to its other nootropic or antidepressant effects?"
StackAdvice,322jrj,Debonaire_Death,2,Fri Apr 10 05:30:18 2015 UTC,"Tianeptine is only a full µ-opioid agonist at recreational doses. At the therapeutic dose (12.5mg TID) it's only a partial, which is what you'd want if you're trying to rehabilitate your opioid neurons.  Also, I cannot emphasize enough how much daily exercise would help you. Releasing endorphins (your endogenous opioid), lowering blood pressure, increasing mitochondrial genesis (which will make you feel more alert and give you a larger energy reserve) as well as minimizing the negative effects of just about anything you take, and even making any drug you take more effective, due to it's widening effect on the tight junctions at the Blood Brain Barrier.  Exercise also signals production of a host of growth factors that can benefit your mind and body in general, including VEGF, IGF-1, and FGF, which will work synergistically in your brain and predispose you to any sort of learning program you subject yourself to immediately following exercise. I make sure to do my cardio (which has been shown to most strongly exhibit the effects I listed above) every day before class.  There's also plyometrics, or explosive movement training, and anaerobics, which can strengthen the immune system and the mind-body connectivity due to the intensity of the signals such exercises require.  Not to mention that exercise will affect your gene expression, which would do amazing things during your developmental years (I presume you still have some more to go?).  If you want to look deeper into exercise's benefits, check out Spark; great book that plainly lays out the results of cutting-edge research in the thought-movement connection.  And seriously: exercise makes any drug better. You'll get cleaner  highs and  higher lows, and will find you are overall more resilient to crashes, withdrawals, and  other side effects. This even applies to recreational drugs (which you'll have plenty of time to responsibly try once you're older)."

My routine is wake up early, take 1tsp of creatine with water, go back to sleep or rest in bed for 30-45 mins, then mix my caffeine and theanine with some water, wait another 30-45 mins, then eat breakfast.   Then around 2 hours after eating lunch, I take a second dose of 200mg caffeine + 200mg l-theanine. Has been working like a charm ever since my body acclimated to the theanine.   Honestly, it's a slippery slope with opiates/opioids. I've taken kratom and yeah, it's awesome and does have a lot of benefits. But if you're prone to substance abuse, it's really no different than taking a pharmaceutical opioid. As far as tianeptine goes, I'm still doing research and experimenting with it. I got a gram yesterday and took around 20mg and it put me in a decent mood (however I was in a great mood all day without it yesterday) but after about 2-3 hours, a strange pseudo-headache set in that gave me the sensation that thinking was just too much effort. I took another dose at that point and the headache-thing persisted. I'm a little hesitant to continue using it now. But I may just need to get past a hump of figuring out how to benefit from it."

It definitely seems like, at least for me, I need to take some of these things for 3-5 days before I get a good result from them.

StackAdvice,321e5b,Jackolysis,4,Thu Apr 9 20:25:11 2015 UTC,"I have, out of necessity, been reading extensively on sleep regulation and supplements. I have to say it is an incredibly complex problem, once some sort of dis-regulation occurs. Like /u/Jackolysis says, melatonin in very small amounts may be helpful; most people attempt melatonin in much higher amounts and have adverse effects as a result. Melatonin affects the circadian rhythm cycle.    The common prescribed sleep inducing drugs, such as Zolpidem or Zopiclone work on GABA A receptors. Phenibut works on GABA B. Pretty much anything involving the GABA system can get risky in terms of addiction and altering GABA regulation pretty fast, so be careful of these (most people would also state they are not nootropics).   Antihistamines (like Benadryl) also have negatives such as tolerance and addiction, but work by affecting histamine in the brain; Histamines are associated with the state of wakefulness/alertness.  Now, this is not really addressing your original question but I think it gets to the point that there are a lot of interdependencies in the sleep/wakefulness system that a) scientists are barely unraveling now and b) make finding a solution that doesn't upset the apple cart somewhere else very difficult.  Other things you could look into: Valerian root, chamomille, passionflower, hops..."

StackAdvice,320487,cryoAnon,3,Fri Apr 10 19:00:32 2015 UTC,There might be some effects on absorption in your gut depending on the order you take certain supplements before and after with and without food. It would probably have the most impact on supplements with relatively low bioavailability. For some supplements it wouldn't matter so much.
StackAdvice,320487,Debonaire_Death,2,Thu Apr 9 19:20:31 2015 UTC,"I like to make a nutrient/protein shake for my with food supplements. I've found the absorption to be even better than taking it with solid food, and far smoother. If any of my supps are encapsulated (which I'm working away from as my old supps turnover: bulk is just better, no mag stearate :) ) I just break open the cap and pour it in (If it isn't terribly acidic). Most protein shakes are already optimized to be quickly digested and absorbed, so you still get quick action and a far more consistent efficacy.  With empty stomach supps, I find that some inhibit others, especially if they are drastically different pH, and that some (like SAMe or dexamphetamine) are particularly sensitive and generally need to be given an early window to absorb before taking the rest of the empty stomach supps if full effects are desired. Generally anything sold in a blister pack is going to be particularly sensitive to neutralization.  Besides that, you shouldn't need to worry. Even with empty stomach supps, I still prefer putting them into aqueous solution if its tolerable, generally with my pre-workout BCAAs and some trace minerals to make the pH tooth-enamel tolerable.

StackAdvice,31vx1y,JahaaziToker,11,Wed Apr 8 16:01:23 2015 UTC,"Magnesium and melatonin will help with the muscle cramps and sleeplessness that comes from CB receptor downregulation. You'll want a chelated form of magnesium like magnesium bisglycinate (or glycinate), magnesium malate, magnesium taurate - cheaper forms of magnesium such as citrate and oxide are known to not be as effective.  Avoid taking anything too activating, like ALCAR or caffeine. They'll make you more irritable as you come off. Same goes for excessive downers as well, like alcohol - if you can't trust yourself to stick to a single beer, then don't consume any at all. It'll disrupt your sleep, which will be already fragile enough as it is.  Practice breathing exercises and try doing cardio or weight-lifting at least three times a week for 40 minutes, if you don't already. Consider creatine if you go this route, as it's been shown to increase exercise tolerance, which will make you want to do it more for longer.   Be sure your diet is good. Don't drink sugary beverages that'll spike your blood sugar or insulin. Be sure to get enough protein and drink enough water to stay hydrated. Coming off of pot when you've used it long-term can sometimes make you forget to take meals, so I'd set alarms to ensure you're getting your three square meals. This will ensure that neither high blood sugar or low blood sugar will cause problems for you.

Tylenol is a cannabinoid reuptake inhibitor which may help lessen withdrawal a bit. Stick to 1500mg a day or under - preferably around 1000mg if you can. If you do take Tylenol, then you should also not consume any alcohol.   It also depends on your dosing schedule with cannabis. If you smoke frequently, try cutting back to just at the evening, and only half of what you consume. If you only consume in the evening, only have a light dose for a few nights, before coming off entirely. It really depends on how much you've been doing and for how long.

NSI-189 made reacting in a social situation far more intuitive and emotional, which I'm sure made me seem far more genuine (which I was) and prevented me from overthinking what I was doing and accruing unnecessary anxiety. Once you're into the conversation, NSI-189 makes it such an adventure that you forget to worry about the dynamics of the situation, which will generally be fine if you're being attentive, which I also find NSI-189 helps with in social situations.  My only issue with it is the lack of focus, and the fact that it can have nasty contraindications (low-potency racetams are a no-go). It seems to help with lasting behavioral modification in a big way though: I've generally seen lasting effects with whatever I put my mind to changing.  And this is the other downside for me: eventually, it becomes hard to put my mind to anything. NSI-189 destroys your sensory gating over time, which took a catastrophic toll on my focusing ability. This is easily reversed once you go off of the drug, though, and I find a good cycle of the stuff will make you respond very well to a racetam immediately afterwards for a good few weeks (this is if you've already built up a tolerance/don't respond highly to racetams).   There's also SEMAX, which definitely can help with focus and increases BDNF. I don't know that the BDNF would be strong enough for it to acutely increase charisma, like with NSI, but the anxiolysis of the enkaphalin RI would definitely do a trick or two."

The majority of mine derived from plant extracts (L-theanine) just in higher doses than one would normally find in X cups of tea.  L-theanine is taken to promote calm, countering the side effect of Caffeine, taken in coffee/tea/soda/pill form.  I also take Huperzine A (A compound found in firmoss ""Huperzia serrata"") that is a 'acetylcholinesterase inhibitor' -- as I understand it, it keeps the learning neurotransmitters active in your brain longer, improving memory and cognition.  Ginkgo Biloba is a pretty standard natural supplement that improves blood circulation, and memory.  Alpha GPC - Is a acetylcholine (Learning Neurotransmitter) precursor (building block). This ensures I have what's needed in my system for acetylcholine to be produced.  Vinpocetine - Improves cerebral Bloodflow, improving memory and cognition. (Artificial replication of substance found in periwinkle plant Vinca minor) So this one is synthetic, but gives my brain the push it needs to overcome my ADHD-PI hurdles, and make decisions easier.

StackAdvice,31exff,Debonaire_Death,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:36:21 2015 UTC,"Be careful mixing the piracetam and ginkgo in too high of doses; both are blood thinners. Also, keep track of any other blood-thinning medications you might be prescribed or stack yourself.  Also, I wouldn't bother with a multivitamin. It dumps a bunch of nutrients into your body that are supposed to get naturally absorbed over the course of the entire day in one sitting, and in the process a bunch of it just gets flushed out. If you think you have a nutrient deficiency, I would get the correct micronutrients and supplement them at the optimal timing.  The alpha GPC generally has a duration of action of about 4 hours, in my experience. I would split your dosing up into 300mg TID.  Definitely go to baseline (no hard drugs/herbs in system) before trying the Modafinil; that drug can get really nasty based on one's biochemical makeup alone, no contraindications included."

Also you should run a PCT afterwords, something simple like Nolvadex 40/40/20/20.  Creatine is obviously a great choice for both brain and muscle with plenty of studies backing it's effects in both.  Taurine is never a bad idea.  Caffeine preworkout can definitely give you a boost.  5000-10000 IU vitamin D is a great idea. I believe a study came out saying 1/3 of Americans are deficient. Low vitamin D can lead to lower testosterone levels.  Honestly the most important ""stack"" to help out with your goals would be to ensure you're getting adequate sleep and proper nutrition.

If you workout in the morning, make these workout days.  Modafinil is potentiated by low dose yohimbine.  I also cap myself a stack for focus which is very effective:   40 mg NSI-189 15 mg Tianeptine 10 mg Noopept the contents of  1 capsule if Advanced B Complex by AOR   All these fit into a 000 capsule (I use a cap'em quick machine and plastic scoops combined with a milligram precision scale to measure - I first work out how many scoops of each substance I have to add to each capsule to reach the weight I need, then add the required quantity to each capsule).  Take a maximum of 2 per day and take frequent breaks.  Works wonders with focus but makes me a bit tense (I added the noopept and tianeptine to soften the harsh tension and anxiety produced by the NSI-189).  In theory this stack helps neurogenesys but the only effect I have noticed is a very strong focus effect.  The uridine + DHA + Citicoline, also called the Mr Happy Stack worked wonders for me. It is a long term brain builder. No more struggling to find words, etc.  Even citicoline by itself can be very powerful - do 2 grams per day for 1 month, every day. The maximum amount I have seen in studies is 3 g/day. It rebuilds your brain.   The stack is described here: http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/51802-gpc-choline-uridine-dha/  Phenylpiracetam is very quick acting and it is good to have around. Unfortunately it causes fast tolerance and I use it only once a week. It is good to have as a rarely used turbo button. It can help you in the gym, too.   If you are dieting hard and feel your mind doesn't work well because of hypoglycemia, try taking a pill of R-ALA with biotin (the biotin is needed so your hair does not fall off - the R-Ala tends to deplete Biotin). The relief is immediate -  the ALA helps your brain create more glucose transporter molecules and thus function better while in hypoglycemia).  Idebenone, emoxypine, Acetyl-l-carnitine and other substances can help your vision - very important for programmers. http://www.longecity.org/forum/?app=stacks&module=display&section=index&do=view&id=19  On the RC market you can find Isopropylphenidate, an analog of Ritalin. I haven't tried it, but it may work well. It may be potentiated by zinc and tyrosine.  What didn't work for me? Racetams, with or without choline.  They gave good results but were NOT sustainable.  Most helpful for me?   Mr Happy Stack or plain citicoline  Modafinil The NSI stack I described above"

Are you concerned about the dependancy potential of  tianeptine?  Are you depressed?  What led you to fasoracetam??  This is not judgemental-I actually like this stack and its similar to mine, though I am not an aniracetam fan."
StackAdvice,3182fv,gna527,1 point,Thu Apr 2 21:20:27 2015 UTC,"I may be depressed; I enjoy the mood-boosting effects of tianeptine. So far I'm not concerned with dependency at this point. I have had one or two days where I was craving it, and also one or two where I didn't even think about it and didn't take it for half the day or more. So far the highest dose I've taken has been 20mg. Don't think I'll breach that -- no point for me really. 12.5mg is just fine.  Fasoracetam is a cool, focus-enhancing anxiolytic racetam for me. Less weirdness and memory-issues than noopept for me (part of why I reduced my noopept intake these last few months). Also the dosages are very forgiving. I feel like 25mg is too much personally, but I know some clinical doses have ranged up to 100mg. It seems many people enjoy 10-15mg doses, as do I. But its anxiolytic action, its boosting of GABA-B and GABA-B receptors, is quite enjoyable and less speedy than aniracetam for me. I found I was getting hooked on the speediness aspect of aniracetam last year for a while; now I've tempered that and added in fasoracetam while also lowering my noopept dosages. It feels more balanced. Also, I like having a go-to racetam that I can carry around in a little container. Fasoracetam is the one I bring with me if I'm going out for the day. Easy and quick to dose in a low-volume/high-density powder."

I've been curious to try nefiracetam but it is currently sold out or unavailable most places.  Aniracetam never served much purpose for me-I could feel it when I took it but I didn't really care much for that feeling.  Noopept is a staple for me but I can't tell exactly what I feel it is doing-I take a small dose twice a day and chalk it up to neuroprotective capacity.  I'll stop all together in another month.  My racetam stack is oxi and prami at the moment-a solid combination with studies results.

Apparently the effects build over time without receptor downregulation, in fact it upregulates GABA-B receptors AFAIK.  Nefiracetam is another one which is supposed to have cumulative effects.

StackAdvice,317ot0,HalfBakedIndividual,1 point,Thu Apr 2 17:26:49 2015 UTC,"Taking Vyvance with some sort of antacid immediately after you swallow the pill has a notable increase in benefits for me. Dexamphetamine is a very alkaline molecule so it is easily damaged by your digestive acids if they're left unchecked. If you are using Vyvance daily, I would go with a weaker base like baking soda to avoid disrupting your digestive system too much, although a stronger antacid like potassium carbonate will generate even stronger effects (you may be fine with carbonate, too--I have liver issues that I think were complicating the use of such a strong antacid). Avoid taking any vitamin c until bedtime or when you are done with your work, as circulating vitamin c will neutralize the effect of Vyvance in any high quantity (I'm planning to take 1g of Vit C in the evening when I first start my next Vyvance cycle, to see if it improves my sleep [always get serious insomnia the first night of a cycle]).  SEMAX cleans off the high and increases the poise and anxiolysis of the drug, while also improving memory retention.  This post is from a much more dedicated soul than I; I largely follow his advice and avoid caffeine and maintain an alkalized  system (I use Concentrace minerals [6 drops per 20oz] and greens supplements such as wheat grass--both invaluable  ways  to simplify the alkalizing  process without having  to intake acids  that will neutralize the dexamphetamine) and I think I've gleaned results from doing  so."

StackAdvice,3142qd,whoisbambam,1 point,Sat Apr 4 00:11:27 2015 UTC,"I've been prescribed propranolol and diazepam for my anxiety. It works so well, usually I'm a sweating, shaky mess when doing presentations but these help significantly. They aren't something you're meant to take all the time, just before doing something that can trigger your anxiety.  I can't be bothered checking but I imagine propranolol shouldn't be too difficult to get your hands on.  Diazepam though is another story and that's where you're probably better off trying a nootropic. Theanine, tianptine and various racetams have anxiolytic effects. Phenibut is another option but potentially not a very good one considering it can be rather addictive.  If you wanted to go the nootropics route theanine would probably be the best option to start with for a beginner."

I have an extremely stressful and fast-paced job.......i usually try to only take 40mg of inderal.......but there are weeks so bad that i take 80mg.......if i dont take it, my back aches like crazy and i am clearly stressed.........  but since i have been taking this ksm-66 and zembrin, along with one capsule of silexan calmaid lavender.....before work.......damn.........i dont need inderal---but it is MUCH better.........  I am a happier person--i smile more, i socialize more (in passing with my coworkers)......it is like nothing i have ever experienced in my entire life.  other versions of ashwaghanda did NOT work. silexan alone did not work........all three of these combined.......has, without question, affected me tremendously--in a most positive way.  finally.  you can see some of my other posts on the matter if u wish.  having said that.......if i was going on a new job interview....or something extremely acutely stressful.......i would probably take 20mg of my inderal  /u/tecumseh5  if it works for you, please come back here and tag me /u/whoisbambam and share your experience--i want to know how this combination affects others."

StackAdvice,30wc37,BlackWindZero,2,Tue Mar 31 05:58:17 2015 UTC,I'm currently medicated for the depression (which obviously isn't working...).   Details?  It can be important to avoid interactions.
StackAdvice,30wc37,shrillthrill,2,Tue Mar 31 10:00:30 2015 UTC,"I'm 27 and started noticing all of these problems when I was around 24. It's been a pretty long journey to find the actual cause of everything and I'm going to warn you, it may take a considerable amount lot of time and effort which can be difficult when depression is at work but you have to push through it.  1) The first is that you need to make sure you are getting adequate exercise and a proper diet.  Most people are tired because they are simply in bad shape. Aim to get the blood pumping for at least 30m a day. Refined sugars and carbs have a profoundly negative role on energy and mood. More than people realize; Make sure you are doing everything humanly possible to eliminate the crap. High fat and protein diets have been shown to greatly affect general cognition as well as physical well being.  2) Look into your methylation cycle. Methlyation is a very complex set of interactions in your body that need to happen efficiently in order for cells to replicate properly. As much as 60% of people have some sort of mutation that lowers the efficiency of one or more of these interaction. The effects of a dysfunction include, overproduction of homocystine and ammonia, rapid depletion of B vitamins and reduced metabolism of folate. The methylation cycle has been researched for a while now but simple genetic testing like that from 23andMe makes it very easy to find if you have mutations in these key areas. I've heard of a number of cases where B6, B12 and L-methylfolate have been very successful in treating depression and even schizophrenia.  3) Start a memory and focus stack. I've always found that piracetam works very well over time. Others around here might promote other drugs from the racetam family but it's always been very helpful for me. Caffeine and l-theanine cause an improvement in focus and anxiety for most but with CSD, I can't imagine it being enough. Tianeptine is a relatively new antidepressant and legal almost everywhere. I use it quite regularly and would vouch for its effectiveness. Lots of other users will recommend other drugs and supplements but I like to stick to the basics.   4) Lastly is meditation. /r/Meditation has some very good information on getting started. You'll wait to refrain from having any expectations about meditation; just let it happen. You will learn a lot about yourself and sometimes that's necessary to getting past a lot of mental issues. It's also been scientifically shown to rewire the brain in a positive way.  I hope that helps."

Actually,  I'd start just before that with prayer/meditation (about 10 minutes each); if you don't recognize the value of prayer (or maybe even if you do) start a thankfulness journal &  spend 10 minutes writing in It  before  meditation.

It is worth while to note that there were cancer risk differences between the rat and mice groups. Which may indicate potential problems with using the mouse model for human populations.  I took a quick look at the study and it looks to be decently done. A few problems with the short term parts of the study with sample size, but the longer term portion was acceptable.

StackAdvice,30owd4,nikosmarkou,3,Sun Mar 29 17:23:58 2015 UTC,"5-HTP will suppress serotonin production, not dopamine.    5-HTP raises serotonin. Higher serotonin equals lower dopamine.  Source: http://nootriment.com/5-htp-effects/   One issue that has prompted concern is the over-depletion of dopamine and norepinephrine. 5-HTP effects regulate dopamine release during its conversion into serotonin. The worry is that this type of hormonal interference may reduce the body’s ability to use dopamine and norepinephrine for their intended function, regulating heart rate, blood flow, and fight or flight responses. For this reason some doctors caution against long term use of 5-HTP, though not enough research has yet been published either way.   You are probably thinking of Tyrosine, not 5-HTP.   And ZMA is made to be taken at night and improves sleep.   By virtue of the Magnesium, yes, it can be relaxing. But some people respond more heavily to the Zinc in ZMA than the Magnesium (especially if they don't actually have a Zinc deficiency) which can lead to over-antagonism of the GABA receptors. Many people report having intense, vivid dreams, and non-restful sleep while taking ZMA or Zinc in general, which leads them to take it in the morning instead. This is anecdotally reported more often with high intakes of calcium - which makes sense, as both Zinc and Calcium can be stimulating under the right conditions.

You might want to consider getting some l-theanine too, another nootropic, which has some preliminary evidence in animals for helping with PTSD but otherwise seems to be good for mitigating small amounts of stress in humans as well as pairing well with caffeine.

StackAdvice,30jhvz,cryoAnon,1 point,Fri Mar 27 23:32:33 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of people who take several racetam products together. It really depends on what effects you are looking for. I would suggest starting by taking them individually so you can gage which ones work best, or if you have a bad reaction to any of them. Always pays to be safe.  The other racetams will have different dosing amounts, so you will need to do a little bit of research to find what you should take. I don't have that much experience outside aniracetam.  Choline can be taken with all the racetams. Especially if you are getting headaches. I'll just add a disclaimer that i've experienced brain fog when taking too much of a choline source with a racetam, and that i've read about plenty others who have as well.   The best advice is start with one product, see how it goes and slowly add to your stack.  Aniracetam can be taken with or without food, take it with a glass of water. Aniracetam is oil soluble, and if I remember right most of the other racetams are water soluble. It's not uncommon for people to take a little food, with the tongue tingling variants.

It's all-around really good for you, and there's evidence it may reduce inflammation in the brain, which may be tied to anxiety/depression. Purely anecdotally, it's done wonders for my mental health.  I like Doctor's Best high-absorption magnesium. Amazon sells 200mg pills.  Consider pairing rhodiola with the ashwagandha. They may be synergistic, and rhodiola on its own may help your anxiety. Consider probiotics. There's evidence that gut microbiota can affect mood; specifically, fucked-up gut flora may be tied to depression/anxiety. Labdoor.com has a good ranking of probiotics.  There's pretty much zero risk in taking more L-theanine, so you might experiment with taking more to see how that feels. Take a B multivitamin.  Eat lots of dark leafy green vegetables.

StackAdvice,30f3am,Jackolysis,2,Fri Mar 27 03:43:18 2015 UTC,You could consider 5HTP For both depression and anxiety.  Bacopa is fine and so would ashwagandha be in moderate doses. Caffeine can contribute to anxiety and so can weed (also possibly depression).  If your serious about this try a month without both and see if it helps. If you like to smoke etc find out how much is the right amount for you while being  critical of the effects. General health as people have said will definitely help.   You could also have a thorough look at St John's Wart. If you don't take anything that interacts it might be worth considering.

Also, it's well-known, here in the US at least, that researchers are not given money to show the positive side effects of cannabis. NSAIDs are far more toxic and lethal than cannabis.

If I was to take a bet though based on the research i've read I'd err on removing it.  Just because a substance can be toxic doesn't mean it still can't have benefits that may outweigh the risk...This is true for most all medicine. NSAIDs have good uses and bad just as cannabis has good uses and bad. Cannabis can help reduce inflammation, but if it could possibly in other ways contribute to depression/anxiety I would personally choose an alternate medicine.  I assumed if you choose to take an NSAID to aid in your stack you wouldn't be using in levels or such a way that is likely to cause death.   If you are worried about abusing an NSAID, it might be best to stay away from self prescribing."

Do you have a diagnosed Vitamin D deficiency? 10,000IU x2 is considered a fairly high supplemental dose.   I was diagnosed with a D deficiency.

StackAdvice,30anwb,AMuslimPharmer,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:58:06 2015 UTC,"I would suggest cutting out the 5-HTP if you are on an SSRI.  Its just not worth the risk.  I'd say to cut out the tyrosine as well, but that one is less (relatively) risky than the tryptophan.  Neither is a good idea given the drugs you are on imo. Eat lots of protein throughout the day (both meat and plants, preferably nuts), and you will get more than enough tyrosine and tryptophan to prevent any deficiencies due to SSRI/SSDI use.    Can't say that I know anything about SSREs, so I can't help you there, sorry.  Choline would be BEST if taken in the evening, as the brain does a lot of its best work at replinishing such substances as ACh at night.  However, since you are taking dramamine, it may be better to take the choline in the morning right when you wake up. I'm guessing you are using dramamine for sleep.  It works to knock you out, but can inhibit REM sleep, and isn't the best thing to use for sleep for a number of other reasons.  I suggest using melatonin and/or valerian root if you are having trouble getting to sleep.  Honestly though, melatonin is not a great thing to be taking every day long-term, as it affects your body's own production of melatonin over time.  Valerian root is a very effective sedative, and has almost no side effects...But it smells insanely bad.  It smells like vomit soaked up with Chewbacca's armit hair, ground up, and put into a capsule.  Just trust me on that.  Don't smell it before you take it.  It really doesn't taste like much of anything when you take the capsules, but you can still smell it as you swallow it.  Oh, and it makes for some gnarly burps.  Best thing for sleep, is to turn off the lights, turn down your phone screen brightness, and get into bed at the time you want to go to sleep.  There are a ton of studies showing that too much light (especially blue light) inhibits sleep.  So if you can just turn off the phone, that would be better, but for most people I think its asking a lot. The MOST vital thing to getting to sleep is to make sure that the temperature in your bedroom is 68 degrees F or lower.  This has the largest effect on sleepiness.  If you are too hot, you will have difficulty getting to sleep, and will have worse sleep quality when you do finally crash.  Hope it helps a bit!

I once took phenibut 2g a day for 2 consecutive days, at the end of the second day, I experienced a sudden onset of mild depressive episode (lack of motivation, suicidal thought, doomsday feeling).

I have experienced rapid tolerance build up from tianeptine and think it lends itself to daily use, but I haven't been using it very responsibly.  In many countries it's used as a daily prescription though, so at the recommended dose and schedule it should be safe to take every day.  I know of a place you can get 10 grams for $38.88 with free shipping, feel free to message me if you'd like to know where.

I have had these experiences more than a fee times before, and a couple of them felt like minutes so maybe this had nothing to do with the L I've been taking or took this morning. What happened was I was signing out of an office and had apparently signed in as if I'd gotten there an hour earlier. Those seconds of trying to figure out what time it really was (I'd been there only 20 minutes) vs. believing my sign in time felt like the ground was breaking underfoot.

StackAdvice,304n75,uberneoconcert,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:21:50 2015 UTC,"Anxiety and focus level are definitely a possibility. The last time it happened was at the end of the day when I was meeting friends at a grocery store last year.  I am usually the late person and expect to see people when I arrive anywhere. But when I got there I was the first. So I was pushing my cart and fell into this state where I was questioning whether the plans had been confirmed, then a couple of minutes later of being alone, was questioning whether my friends even existed. I sort of played with this state of mind but pulled myself out of it by thinking ""OK if I made up the friends and plan, how did I get here, where do I live, and who are my friends?""   It gave me a little bit of pause to wonder whether it's not so hard for people to have psychotic breaks - to go just far enough into the fantasy to believe it more than their previous reality. My close friend is bipolar and had a psychotic break. Over a month later she was trying to pull herself out of it. In between telling me her fears (at the mental health hospital where she was committed), which were completely paranoid, she was saying ""I know some of these things aren't real, but I can't tell which ones.""

I'm a perfectionist but never thought of myself as OCD, but perhaps ADHD which I overcompensate for by trying to be organized. (I was tested as a kid twice and told I was normal but later I met a child psychology researcher at Duke who told me I obviously have low dopamine, and told me that was a part of a particular ADHD diagnosis that makes me very impulsive, and enjoy dangerous situations.)  I do tend to get lost in anything I'm working on because I can never do just one thing at a time. With organizing, I'll let whatever I'm trying to get under control/planned out branch into too many other things such as other ideas that I come up with, setting more meetings, color coding my calendar, whatever. If I try to do just one thing, I get this feeling of emergency that by ignoring my new or unrelated ideas I will miss out on noting or implementing them where they belong.  I find a lot of my attempts at getting organized is a work in progress that I lose steam on... I don't know exactly when to stop organizing my info and making it look good vs getting back to my other tasks. I know that if i don't organize my work well, I won't be able to produce as great of a report - status update or final deliverable.   Another example is I'll sit down to scan a backlog of receipts (I'm a consultant) and at the same time, open my invoice to plug some of the reimbursables, open QuickBooks to try to organize the charges into the proper accounts (which I endeavor to be good at), and end up making a huge plunge that leaves none of those things done. (Maybe this is typical, I don't know.) Or I'll try to go through my previous month's notes to make sure I don't let something fall, and start to enter in new contacts, draft emails to people, and plug in some of my notes to various projects. I'll pick up the phone to catch up with someone. It's not like I'm losing my mind, but I definitely feel like I overwork my brain without getting enough accomplished. The dissociation thing happens rarely. I mostly feel like I'm daydreaming and note-taking more than doing.  I have too many projects that are all over the place and rarely feel finished. (Now I just feel like I'm venting. Sorry - I do hope you have ideas for me!) But no I don't use chemicals other than drinking sometimes, smoking sometimes, coffee every morning.

Gratitude, the feeling of appreciation or thanks, has gained a lot of attention in the field of positive psychology. Studies have found that those who are habitually grateful are significantly happier than those who are not [citation needed]. Furthermore, studies suggest that feelings of gratitude may even possess health benefits [citation needed]. Positive psychology strives to develop methods by which one can consistently enhance gratitude levels. The most popular method thus far is the maintenance of a gratitude journal [citation needed]. Furthermore, the maintenance of a gratitude journal can help relieve depressive symptoms [citation needed].

Please listen to me on this, I've been trying to patch myself up with supplements and drugs since I was 17, and now at 22 I am finally realizing that all I did was make worse by not figuring out how to be comfortable in my own skin/mind/environment when I was younger.

In school every day is more depressing then the last , no real friends , simply friend because there is no other option , but not real friends , crippling anxiety , ridiculous neediness , which is getting progressively worse may i add , i've given up , i'm just counting these last 14 months off ( then i got to university where im hoping things will be different , but hey i said the same from primary school , to secondary ,and now to 6 form , all of which turned out to be shit ) . I've been emotionally abused , used , essentially made to feel like shit , now im currently better then i once was ( at previous points i have been seriously suicidal ) . But im realistic , these aren't irrational thoughts , these are logical , these months coming up will bring me nothing useful , sure they'll be aright moments here and there , but i know , for a fact, this next year is going to be rough overall , and i'm not looking for a miracle pill , im looking for a break , from this constant torment , constant pain , which i can not handle , it casues further problems, i'm just diging deeper and deeper into an endless pit of sadnes s, loneliness , pain and suffering .

Don't hang out with anyone who doesn't make you look forward to hanging out with them. Negative people will only hinder your situation. Talk to a good friend or a family member. Or even a stranger on the internet. Just talk it out with someone. It helps organize your thoughts and it's amazingly helpful to have someone to share your emotions with.

StackAdvice,2ztadf,Kerzy11,1 point,Sun Mar 22 20:57:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe you didn't understand the research?... The two are not even remotely similar.  One is calming and lessens (or I should say, helps smooth) the peripheral effects of amph/caffeine, the other restores baseline DA (which will do the opposite if you're DA deficient).  From a memory perspective, theanine won't help much - unless you feel like anxiety is diminishing your retention abilities... People who aren't on something as strong as adderall might claim decent benefits. But, from an aderall perspective, you won't even feel it. That is, again, unless your anxiety is bad.  If you have a history of anxiety, caffeine will exasperate it. However, theanine will help with that and other aspects, such as jitters. As mentioned before, it will also help with amph peripheral effects.  One thing to note, there is a bell curve when it comes to arousal. Too much, easy tasks become easier and complex tasks become harder; too little, complex tasks become easier, easy tasks become harder. This is true for retention, and I, anecdotally, have experienced this... Simply put, caffeine, with or without things like theanine become a hindrance when I'm adderall...

I'm assuming I don't have to explain how amph works, so the above replaces all of the neurotransmitter stores that amph burns through.   I take my theanine in the form of LGNC-07; that is, a fancy way of saying a 6:1 ratio of EGCG to theanine. I primarily take it for its synergy with EGCG, and less for the anxiety aspects of it.

There really isn't anything on the market that is going to make it easy/unnecessary to study, but there are a few things that you can take to help you study.  I'd first recommend a caffeine:theanine blend. It's the most common and cheapest noot available, and will give a boost similar to many energy drinks but for a fraction of the cost. Buy them in bulk with a scale and empty capsules and mix it yourself (200mg theanine to 100mg caffeine). Take a few days off of this combo every week or you'll build up tolerance.   Adrafinil is the commercially available (legal to buy and moderately priced) version of modafinil, which is a class of compounds that will wake you up when tired. It's infinitely better than drinking 5 cups of coffee, but you shouldn't take it every day. It can cause liver damage if abused, so be responsible with it's usage.   There's good evidence that Omega-3 supplementation (aka fish oil) can alleviate many of the cognitive symptoms of ADHD. If you feel like you might have problems concentrating over long study sessions then trying this supplement is a no brainer."
StackAdvice,2zsk9p,tornados2111,1 point,Sat Mar 21 23:32:51 2015 UTC,Can you just drink coffee separately and just buy the L-theanine?  I've read that L-theanine has no tolerance. Is this true?

StackAdvice,2zsmgy,happypiggy,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:54:40 2015 UTC,I think l-theanine is more effective than taurine. Maybe double up or stagger them.  Big doses of fish oil are good for anxiety as well.
StackAdvice,2zsmgy,turtleturds,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:47:46 2015 UTC,"I suffer from occasional anxiety (mostly when sleep deprived) and modafinil gives me cleaner energy than coffee, and doesn't seem to affect anxiety as bad as coffee. However, I typically combine them because I can't go a day without a cup of coffee. Dosage is important here because too much modafinil with too much coffee is a horrible feeling.  I typically do 50mg modafinil with 15oz of strong coffee when needed. I could honestly go down to 25mg modafinil and still feel the effects. BUT, if your anxiety is really bad I wouldn't even consider combing them. Coffee in general is terrible at amplifying anxiety IMO. And adding 20-30mg of l-theanine can definitely help to avoid ""the shakes"" from over stimulation from either substance.  Anyway, modafinil and l-theanine is a good combo. Caffeine with modafinil probably isn't a great idea. Just thought I'd give my experience since anxiety was stated."

Coconut oil in your coffee (you don't have to be full Bulletproof, breh), or tea in the morning.   Noopept - The best of the Racetam family.  Stack with Choline, or don't bother. Modafinil works.  Strong stuff - I only take 50mg, when needed, and when I do, I tend to add 10mg of Vinpocetine, just for fun.   Might want to consider a stack of Niacinamide (1000mg 3x day), Choline (500mg 3x day) & B6 (1-300mg 3x day) as a base.  I recommend that to people who have depression & addiction issues, and most notice a change in less than 5 days.  Theanine is the business.  Short life span once taken, but taken strategically (like before a business meeting or date), it's damn near perfect for being in the zone. Please don't overlook Magnesium.

StackAdvice,2zryvj,BrainEnhance,2,Sat Mar 28 09:10:35 2015 UTC,"(Updated 10th April) I'm going to leave my nootropic experiences here:   L-theanine   I used to take 150mg in the late afternoon to help reduce the brain fog caused by drinking too much coffee during the day(I don't take it with coffee since it reduces the effects of caffeine). But now, I take Alpha GPC/CDP choline in the late afternoon which helps relieve the brain fog caused by choline depletion in the brain much more effectively than L-theanine.   Smart Caffeine(26th March)   no effect, probably because I have a high caffeine tolerance.    CILTEP(26th March)   It doesn't do much on its own but it magnifies the effects of caffeine. When taken with caffeine, I get excessive adrenaline rush and a heart palpitation which I don't really like the feeling of and it doesn't make me think better than when I'm just on caffeine. It also gave me a painful acid reflux due to the rise in stomach pH and I had to run to the fridge to drink milk and eat yogurt because it burned my esophogus. I won't be taking this anymore because it doesn't help with my cognition.   Creatine   every time I take it, I can feel my thoughts slightly improve shortly after taking it. It also seems to offset the brain fog caused by choline depletion from drinking coffee during the day. I'm going to continue taking 5g a day.    Coenzyme q-10   no noticeable effect in cognition or energy. Not sure if it's worth taking or not.   ALCAR   gave me some noticeable energy for 1 - 2 hours and then it returned to normal. I felt like it caused me to crash a little afterwards so I didn't like it.   Alpha GPC/CDP choline   I take it after my cup of coffee which seems to offset the brain fog caused by choline depletion in the brain from drinking coffee during the day.    iodine(1st April)   not an nootropic, but as soon as I took 1000mg Kelp(240mcg equiv. iodine), I started feeling a warmth in my thyroid gland followed by a surge in energy, pleasant buzz in my forehead and general feeling of wellbeing for 10 minutes which was unexpected. From third day onwards, I stopped having these effects so I must have been deficient in iodine. I've tried taking 2000mg Kelp(480mcg equiv. iodine) and I felt a slight buzz in my forehead again but I didn't feel anything else.   Aniracetam(3rd April)   took 800mg Aniracetam from Bulk Nutrients and barely felt anything from it. Few hours later, I started feeling a little spaced out(lost my attention every few seconds) which was a little scary and an undesirable effect but it went away within a few hours. took 750mg Aniracetam from Nootropics Depot on 9th April and again, I could barely notice anything.    Nicotine gum(3rd April)   I originally wasn't planning on trying nicotine, but after reading on Examine.com's Stack Guides about 2 - 4mg of nicotine being an 'proven' nootropic, I've decided to give it a go. But I didn’t do enough further research to find out that the lethal dose of nicotine is extremely low at 30mg. Upon chewing the 4mg nicotine gum, within half an hour, I started feeling extremely sick and I became very close to dialling 000 because I seriously thought I was going to die from nicotine overdose. I guess my lethal dose must have been lower for me since I’m a non-smoker and I’ve never had nicotine before. However, today I only took 1mg of nicotine gum and although it boosted my motivation, it only lasted a few minutes. And as soon as up the dose to 2mg, I started feeling slightly sick again. So I’ve learnt that nicotine isn’t worth it for me since it doesn’t last very long and it can easily make me sick.   Piracetam(8th April)   took 800mg Piracetam from Nootropics Depot. And within half an hour, I started feeling a pleasant buzz in my forehead. I wasn't expecting much after my negative Aniracetam experience but I'm surprised I felt something from Piracetam. took 1600mg the second day and I didn't get as much buzz in my forehead this time. I can tell that it's affecting me but it's very subtle.   Noopept(10th April)   took 15 - 25mg Noopept from Liftmode measured using a AWS gemini-20. I felt a slight increase in attentiveness but it was quite subtle and I was expecting more out of it.   Supplements I'm planning on trying next:   PQQ + Ubiquinol for energy Oxiracetam from New Star Nootropics for cognitive deficit Bacognize from Swanson for cognitive deficit(thanks whoisbambam) KSM-66 Ashwagandha from Swanson for anxiety Jarrow Formula NAC, L-glutamine and Colonstrum for my gut lining, flora and permeability.

Its not the same as adderall, but then again you are basically taking speed. Its got a great effect on learning, but it comes with a price. Not what you wanted to hear, but I suppose I'll take a crack at it anyway.  You could try cycling in other stimulants to lessen the comedown. Try phenylpiracetam the next day, and then maybe Modafinil the day after that. That way you're never taking the same thing 2 days in a row, and ideally your tolerance will have been reduced by the next time you take any given substance.   Of course, you run the risk of adrenal fatigue, but I suppose that as long as you're only doing it for a short period of time (and plan to take some time off eventually) then that shouldn't be such a problem.  Another option is to phase out the adderall altogether and build yourself a stack. It will definitely cost you more money and require some experimentation, but then again you will be able to eat and sleep like a normal person.

NAcSemax is reported to reduce appetite too,  but first try dietary means because you'll be healthier.   For anxiety,  do you meditate?  If not,  start!   Also,  I find that kanna &  sulbutiamine help my anxiety.   I agree about the Ph-piracetam hydrazide.  I find that  Ph-piracetam quickly builds tolerance such that I take it only a few times per year.   For your eyebrows have you tried NAC. (N-Acetyl cystiene)?  It might help.

If eating solid food i dont avoid starch or sugar, but i dont seek them out. I am not a huge pasta fan, and think of bread as a delivery mechanism for meat or fries as delivery for salt and vinegar. Primarily protein in the form of meat, fat as part of the meat, etc. Some dairy.   I exercise at the gym, relatively light, 4x weekly, and try to do something on the other days. For example, i did a 3mi charity walk today and did not go to the gym yesterday, so today i will go and just do weights - low weight, high rep - but skip cycling as a compromise.  Im not terribly overweight, at 6'1 and 195, but i think being more fit will help with confidence and thus anxiety. Even if it doesnt, well - no loss there.

Take that with a cholinergic like ALCAR or CDP choline TID and see if it improves things.  Until you understand how your body reacts to these drugs, you don't want to go for the ""best nootropic you can get"".

As for the headache, that may have to do with choline. I would add the ALCAR, along with an Omega-3 supplement, to see if that doesn't give you a more complete choline supplementation for your stack. I've found that when starting certain racetams your brain seems to really hunger for the choline (this happened with me and pramiracetam recently: I was already on 250mg CDP choline TID and 3g fish oil, and I still had to carry an Alpha GPC capsule around for sublingual administration if the headache came back).  I've done a stack similar to what you are considering many times before. ALA is alpha lipoic acid or alpha linoleic acid?"
StackAdvice,2zko17,Debonaire_Death,2,Thu Mar 19 15:09:10 2015 UTC,Erimin-5   It's a Schedule III under the United Nations Convention. I don't think you will find this sold by to many trustworthy places. Benzodiazepines are Schedule IV in the United States which Erimin-5 would fall under.

Basically, my question is this: Is there an increased risk of Vitamin B6 induced neuropathy from administering both pryitinol and b6? Or does pyritinol not boost b6 levels in the brain/body? I'm aware of the general threshold for b6 induced neuropathy, but i'm just wondering if Pyritinol would increase the likelihood of neuropathy."
StackAdvice,2zjru8,MisterYouAreSoDumb,2,Mon Mar 23 03:36:33 2015 UTC,"Pyritinol is two B6 molecules bound together by a disulfide bond. Disulfide bonds are stronger than hydrogen or ionic bonds, but weaker than carbon-carbon or carbon-hydrogen bonds. They typically have a dissociation energy of 60 kcal/mol. So they are strong enough to keep the two B6 molecules bound together. This means that Pyritinol does not really act as delivery system for B6 itself, and neither increases B6 in the body, nor substitutes for B6."

StackAdvice,2zjru8,Jack-o-Roses,1 point,Mon Mar 23 23:57:05 2015 UTC,All I know is that I took a B6 supplement of about 25-50 mg and I was running B6 levels that were about 30x over the norm. You don't need a lot of B6. You need about 2 mg of it.   Unless you have a genetic mutation I wouldn't supplement with B6. If you are you should get a blood serum test done maybe 3 months after starting and then 6 months after each. And watch for neuropathic issues.  Why do you want to supplement B6?  EDIT: I've read MANY stories about dumb people loading up on B6. I'm actually very surprised the vitamin market isn't regulated as B6 overdoses DO cause permanent damage and it's not pretty. Many people have neuropathic pain and drop stuff all the time and well...just read about all the horror stories.

You might want to take a look at the beginners guide in the sidebar to consider things that do have human evidence.

StackAdvice,2zgesu,OptimusPong,3,Wed Mar 18 11:02:35 2015 UTC,"Many people here have mentioned the [caffeine/theanine] stack (1:2 ratio) here, and it's a very good stack for acute energy/wakefulness. You can buy them in bulk separately, but I recommend making your own matcha green tea 1-2 times daily instead. Aside from working just as well as the capsules, you'll get the benefits of EGCG and green tea phytonutrients. Two teaspoons of good matcha in 1/4 cup of 76 degree water (converted to Celsius for your convenience, but as an American I prefer 170-175 degrees) is a serious kick in the ass. Another great way to get caffeine/theanine mix is by drinking a Yerba Mate blend. This is an herbal ""tea"" native to South America that gives a clear-headed focus and sense of wakefulness without being too jittery or tense. I drank a large quantity of it in Graduate school when putting in 10-14 hour days. Other basic components of this stack might include fish/krill oil and vitamin D. There are other herbal options as well, but they often very in potency or availability depending on location. Things that I have tried for Mental Focus and Sharpness that I recommend you look into or try include: Yohimbine HCl (an appetite suppressant and thermogenic, as well as a medium stimulant; should not be combined with large doses of other stimulants); Sulbutiamine (synthetic vitamin B1; good for an acute energy boost); Aniracetam (racetam with clear headed focus and anxiolytic properties; should be taken 2x daily with food); and a source of choline, I usually take Citicholine. Looking into whether Semax or P21 can be imported into Sweden as a nasal spray would also be worth you time, as I have used both of these compounds and while they are expensive they have pretty impressive acute effects on productivity on par with amphetamines or modafinil.    I also take ALCAR 20-30 minutes before a run or bike ride with creatine, both of which help with endurance and power. I've never really taken these without exercising, so I'm not sure how much of the mental effects are due to a good cardiovascular workout vs the effects of the supplements themselves, but the effects on performance are significant enough to be noticeable, and I always get that ""really good workout"" feeling afterwards without being too tired.   Sleep quality is something that is much harder to pin down. While Valerian, Apigenin commonly ingested in chamomile, and 5-HTP work for some people, none of these compounds are as effect at the population level as melatonin. The downside to melatonin is it's availability and dosing, and it does cause some people to be groggy the next morning. By far the most effective way to increase sleep quality is by participating in a sleep study conducted by medical professionals, reducing your exposure to blue wavelengths of light (from computer screens) after sunset by using a program like f.lux, and tracking both your sleep quality and sleep cycles using one of the various apps on your phone (I liked sleep cycle alarm the most and found it pretty effective, if not exactly convenient).   Anyways, sorry for the wall of text. The short answer is that you can get everything in Alpha brain cheeper in bulk and adjust the dosing; most of the ingredients that I have mentioned are included in the Alpha Brain stack. The long answer is that research and experimentation with the compounds I have suggested, as well as a few lifestyle changes, will maximize the effects of Nootropics in your specific situation.   Hope that helped steer you into the right direction. I can answer any questions on dosing and cycling in a PM or as a response. Cheers."

StackAdvice,2zgesu,elwood2cool,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:51:58 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a very effective wakefulness promoting agent, but it's probably available only by prescription in Sweden. It's a scheduled drug in the US too, but people have gotten around those barriers by purchasing Armodafinil and Adrafinil. Both are metabolized by the liver into Modafinil, which if abused over a long period of time can cause liver damage. Used intermittently they are quite safe.   It's pretty hard to get Armoda online anymore, but you can get adrafinil on powerdercity, and sometimes on Nootropicsdepot. Newstar usually has it too. Swedish customs might seize it, but from what I've read they won't prosecute you for illegal import. As of right now I'm pretty sure Adrafinil is legal for import in Sweden, but don't quote me.  You can purchase Modafinil illegally online and import it, but you run the risk of it being seized at customs and charges might be brought against you. I would advise against this route unless you can find someone who has better knowledge.  Basically, the -afils are treading the line between supplements and actually using prescription drugs off label. They're very effective, and if you talk to your doctor about your problems (or fake narcolepsy), you have a decent shot at Provigil (Moda) being prescribed to you.   Wish I could help you more with the legal side of things, but it's pretty well known that Sweden has strict import and usage laws.    edit: Ceretropic has Adrafinil, and they are one of if not the most reputable vendor mentioned on /r/nootropics.

Alternatively, I would recommend a baseline supplement regime of  caffeine+L-theanine and piracetam+choline for increased mental focus and sharpness.  I'm not sure what you mean by physical energy so I'm not sure what to recommend about that.  For better sleep, melatonin is a good place to start.

StackAdvice,2zgesu,Triglycerine,1 point,Wed Mar 18 14:11:48 2015 UTC,"If you're in sweden then bright light in the morning and vitamin D may help more than nootropics, if you haven't already optimized that aspect of your life.  Then if you want something you will probably feel focus and energy from modafinil, adrafinil or phenylpiracetam would be the way to go.  If you want a well researched, safe and effective stack then go with Bacopa + L-theanine + caffeine  For sleep, light exposure is your biggest enemy, staring at a bright computer screen can inhibit your natural production of melatonin and delay sleep onset. To counter this you can either install a program like f.lux or wear orange blue blocking glasses at night or buy melatonin.

That is a must!  1) Yes, it takes 1-2 weeks to become effective.  2) No, it does not have the same side effects as prescription SSRIs. There are some mild side effects. However, if you are used to strong SSRIs, you probably won't notice anything.  3) I took it for a few months straight. I noticed that I was more calm and upbeat about things. Adverse things did not affect my mood as much, and I was just more even. Being content with things is not always the most useful of traits for everyone, so that could be something not beneficial. It also can reduce the level of antihistamines in the body, which is a bad thing for me. So long term use for me personally makes my Cetirizine dosage go up.

StackAdvice,2zeblv,NootropicMeUp,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:37:04 2015 UTC,Anxiety: Phenibut it's not hard to take it in advance just take it 3 hours before you need it to kick in.  Wakefulness/Energy: Modafinil/Adrafinil.  Those are probably two of the most potent out there. And also if foreign equivalents of the FDA have approved what you're taking they're probably fine.
StackAdvice,2zeblv,Jackolysis,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:59:09 2015 UTC,"Well... the FDA approves a bunch of drugs that have terrible side effects, and there are a lot of things they don't approve which don't have sides... the FDA is a governing body meant to regulate people who want to SELL drugs, which means if nobody wants to sell it, they don't need to regulate it. Case in point: lots of drugs have their patent expired, which means big pharma can't make money on it. THAT means that nobody is going to spend the money on MORE human trials to get it approved by the FDA because they won't have a monopoly on it anyway. You can't sell drugs like other things, you know..  Anyway, rant aside, the ""best"" thing for you to take (if you only take one thing) aside from a powerful multivitamin (you should be taking a multi anyway) IMO would be modafinil. Good, clean energy with minimal/no sides, at least in my experience. I take it with centrophenoxine for an extra boost.  Adderall and Ambien are drugs, great things don't get me wrong but probably worse for you than any of the noots commonly discussed on r/nootropics.   OTC you're not going to have much luck, unless that includes the internet for you. Modafinil is probably your best bet for studying, but I've found that if you add another substance here or there its going to give you a better effect as well as give your brain some more of the tools it needs to take advantage of it effectively.   My advice to you: don't do your research on Powder City or other vendor websites. Use google, and type in ""<insert nootropic name here> experiences"" and browse the reports of what happened to actual human beings when they took it. This is a good barometer of what the effects are, because if you see that 9/10 people said that substance X helped them to study/work/have sex whatever, then chances are that's what it will do for you as well.  Also, go to Examine.com. They are basically a website which aggregates all of the scientific studies done on various drugs and supplements. So if you want to know the SCIENTIFIC PROOF behind fish oil, piracetam or modafinil, just head over there and do a search for it and they will give you an easily digestible breakdown of what it does, according to actual scientific studies. Extremely useful site when doing research, though they don't have any anecdotal evidence (which I find is very useful as well).  We all love adderall.. I think a lot of people look for something that will give us those benefits without the cracked out downsides, and nootropics are not as simple as drugs that are prescribed by your doctor. The fact is that most of them are not prescribed, meaning most people probably don't take them, at least not in the US. So you have to be a bit more experimental, or at least do some research on your own and then take the plunge yourself. I personally stay away from anything that seems like it would have bad long term effects, or even short term effects.  Anyway.. sorry for my long rant. Hope you find what you're looking for."

It's going to be very difficult to find something that works as well as that through vitamins or supplements. You could take phenylalanine but the half life is shorter and doesn't last as long.  Concentration is normally associated with increased norepinephrine neurotransmission. You'll get that from any stimulants. Modafinil is more of a sleep suppressant, but it can be useful. It does not affect norepinephrine though I believe.  I would continue exercising a bit or walking before working since exercise increases blood flow to help with it, sleeping regularly and taking breaks from homework every 2-3 hours to consolidate the info. When I power study I study for 2-3 hours and take a 30-45 min powernap and then do another 2-3 hours. Sleep consolidates memories and it really helps."

I would think that taking succinct notes, underlining text (if u still use books) and periodic review of the material and questions covering that material from other resources (nclex type questions--preferably 3 different books that separate the material by subject area.....try to understand the rationales).  You could also spend a month recording thenclexreview.com videos if they cannot be captured (anything viewed on the screen, drm'd or not, can be recorded, ie wmcapture and recorder from wmrecorder.com (and also tubedigger for download)).....and review those videos by subject BEFORE attending class that is covering that subject.....for a&p review for a particular system to enhance understanding, the teaching company has a course that can be found cheap."

StackAdvice,2z3zuq,Jack-o-Roses,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:45:26 2015 UTC,"When neurosis is in its early, transient stages, neurotransmitter alterations may be able to diminish or alleviate the symptoms. However if the experience of neuroses is repeated and neurally deepened, over time we see strong changes to the functional interconnectivity of the entire brain [http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v40/n2/full/npp2014169a.html], which essentially degrades from an optimal small-world network topology to a more random distribution. Trying to fix a dysfunction so deeply entrenched in network dynamics with nootropics/chemical augmentations is like trying to build a wall with polymer filler.  Having come from a similar set of symptoms, I found TAGsync neurofeedback to be the only way to fundamentally reorganise and rebuild my broken networks (not an over-statement, as you will see in the paper I linked, long-range connectivity is severely disrupted ie fractured in chronic neuroticism). It is based on a solid methodology, as it targets and boosts cross-frequency coupling wherever applied in the brain (as evidenced by observable changes of the EEG over time), which in turn induces a progressive approximation of optimal functional connectivity and the associated removal of neurotic symptoms.  See here for extensive longecity threads on TAGsync and other neurofeedback modalities;  http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/69328-the-power-of-neurofeedback/  http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/72710-tagsync-operation-and-discussion/"
StackAdvice,2z3x2h,barnaby_jonez,4,Sun Mar 15 08:56:28 2015 UTC,"Best bang for your buck might be to attack the other side of the equation with better sleep.  Check out ashwagandha, L-theanine, magnesium and melatonin.    Other supplements that are fairly safe for most people to take during the day: B and D vitamins, rhodiola, ALCAR.  Beyond that, generalized fatigue seems to be hard even for decent doctors to diagnose effectively, so you might try more than one approach at a time.  Get with your GP if you can and see about tests for thyroid, iron, vitamin deficiencies, hormonal imbalances, whatever else they can throw at you.  23andme + promethease can help you find out if you could be genetically prone to situations like under- or over-methylation that might be easily and cheaply treatable with supplements.  It's $100 but if you find yourself a few doctors' visits down this path and haven't gotten to the bottom of it yet, maybe you'd find it worth it."

StackAdvice,2z3x2h,zortor,2,Sun Mar 15 16:51:51 2015 UTC,"I had the anxiety problem as well. Armodafinil (Nuvigil brand). I noticed that if you control your thinking/mindset you can keep the anxiety in check. You have to ""stay busy"" when on (ar)modafinil, IMHO, tell your mind what you want it to do.   It's a bit like owing a border collie dog. (read up on them) They're a very intelligent breed with lots of drive and a strong hearding instinct. They need a task to do. If you don't give a border collie a task, the dog will find something to do himself, and it's usually destructive (i.e.: to your furniture).   I think (ar)modafinil is the same. It will also amplify tasks you do.  Example: So if you look something up on Wikipedia really quick, don't be surprised if you're still sitting on it 12 hours later learing everything about Jon Z. DeLorean, the PRV engine in it, how much it takes to restore a DeLorean car, etc. - but the Modafinil Border Collie in you just wanted to know what the car in Back to the Future is.   If you don't do a task, you're worrying about about what you should be doing, things you have no control over, etc."

But if not, Creapure works just fine (Creapure = 100% pure monohydrate). It will push water into the muscles, allowing you to lift heavier weights, and increase your endurance. It will also aid in the muscle recovery process. Basically, you will gain muscle at a faster rate! Also, if you're 6ft - 130. You should definitely increase your calorie intake. Eat lots of proteins (meats), drink protein shakes, take creatine, eat veggies & fruits, etc. You could even try throwing in some NALT into your stack as it can improve your performance in the gym and help muscle building.
