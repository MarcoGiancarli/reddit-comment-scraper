help,3doi4w,solonicity,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:44:42 2015 UTC,"I get this sometimes too, but then it will end but still not let me post, just says maybe you're new or haven't done well lately. OK, how do I figure that out?   Nothing in my account explains anything about that. Upvoted shows things I posted but ""downvoted"" doesn't list anything (still have not really figured out why anyone would vote on anything. I just read what I want. ?) My account, no matter the forum, say ""5"". User page says 5 link and 55 comment. Is that bad?   But what to look at to see why - and why the delay unless unless negative or spamming with repeated posts? I think it was my first post that day so why would reddit care if I make 1 post now or in 9 minutes? Seems poorly thought out.  Happened the other day on a forum I had posted maybe 1-2 times to previously, and nothing bad, but then continued on I think this forum and the help forum, which is incredibly dumb. I couldn't even ask for help. Just gave up."

help,3dmyky,xiongchiamiov,2,Fri Jul 17 17:33:34 2015 UTC,"Great explaination by Deimorz, I never knew that.  That makes sense then why for the first couple of pages (around 50 links total) I see a random list from my subreddits -- then I start to get second and third place finishers, ordered by how they compare to the top post in their respective reddit.  Since /r/betternews is mostly auto-generated content and there are relatively few subscribers in there is a lot of content very closely homogenized (in terms of votes), so they are ""closer"" to the top post in that reddit than other posts are to the top post in their respective reddit.  Thus, I get spammed with it.    Solution for me for now is to browse rising/controversial/top instead - I changed my bookmark to include these URLs instead of just the default.  Although this whole thing has kind of opened my eyes to /r/betternews and I may just unsubscribe from it in general - it's not really ""better news"" like I thought it was."

I don't know the answer, and it's unlikely a reddit employee will give a solid number, but I hope you aren't actually afraid to comment.  Things like posting new submissions and creating your own subreddit involve a secret recipe. That recipe is a combination of account age in days, plus comment karma, plus how strict the spam filter is set on a particular subreddit, and a few other ingredients. Nobody can see that recipe unless they work for reddit. The web application that powers reddit is open source, but we don't know what values they've configured for each threshold on the live site. And so, all you can do is keep on keeping on.  Nobody's gonna punch you if you get a downvote, so jump in and get your feet wet!"

However, legitimate posts are often caught by the filter. If a few minutes go by and your post isn't showing up on the new page of the community where you posted, it has probably been caught by the filter. This is most likely to occur if you are posting to a community that you have not participated in before. Each community has an independent filter, for example /r/help's filter doesn't talk to /r/pic's filter. In order to remove your post from the filter you need to message the moderators (this link can be found in the sidebar on the right-hand in that community, you can also manually compose a message to #communityname) and ask them to check the filter for you. Eventually the filter will ""learn"" that your posts don't need to be removed. If your posts are frequently removed in one community in particular you can send a request to the moderators to be added as an approved submitter."

Here's Randall Munroe's explanation of how the best sort works.   There's a solution, and it's the new 'Best' ranking. When a few people have voted on a comment, you get a rough idea of its quality. The more people who vote on it, the better an idea you get of where it 'should' ultimately end up. With this algorithm, you quantify exactly how much you can tell about a comment from a limited number of votes.  If everyone got a chance to see a comment and vote on it, it would get some proportion of upvotes to downvotes. This algorithm treats the vote count as a statistical sampling of a hypothetical full vote by everyone, much as in an opinion poll. It uses this to calculate the 95% confidence score for the comment. That is, it gives the comment a provisional ranking that it is 95% sure it will get to. The more votes, the closer the 95% confidence score gets to the actual score."

For example, if I post a link to this thread in another subreddit, those other people might come here and downvote you (for whatever reason). I can prevent this by using the ""np.reddit.com"" version of the URL, so that people who click on it to read your thread will not see any voting arrows."

Through archival recordings, he relates the story of a race of hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings who built a computer named Deep Thought to calculate the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. When the answer was revealed to be 42, Deep Thought explained that the answer was incomprehensible because the beings didn't know what they were asking. It went on to predict that another computer, more powerful than itself would be made and designed by it to calculate the question for the answer. (Later on, referencing this, Adams would create the 42 Puzzle, a puzzle which could be approached in multiple ways, all yielding the answer 42.)   Edit: On a side note about the number itself for ""subscribers"" you can put whatever you want in CSS, and you can always turn off ""Subreddits Styles"" in your preference bar to see the real count.

You need to not be a spammer. Are you not a spammer?  If you are not a spammer, you can appeal the decision to shadowban you by contacting the reddit admins (this appeal process has always existed).   Be aware that one outcome of this process might be that they explain to you clearly and obviously why you were banned and why your ban will not be reversed. The CEO didn't say that all shadowbans would automatically be reversed; he said that shadowbans should apply only to spammers, and other people who get banned should know that they have been banned and why.

If I can use a host that is not on the approved list, such as photobucket (which works well for me), and I am posting an OC photo, and I add OS as well, would that work to post the photo?

Reddit takes no position, and a lot of subs won't care. I'm not sure what sub you're talking about (one of the SFWPorn subs?), but it's always a good idea to message them about their rules.  But yes, the true OS is whatever you took/made it with, but that's not what the [OS] tag is for. The [OS] tag is to stop people going on an artists website/chosen image host, taking their artwork/photo, and simply reuploading it to Imgur or another image host. If you take a photo and upload it to Photobuket, that would be the correct [OS]. Reuploading it to Flickr would make it no longer [OS].  IMO, it doesn't really matter so long as it's taken from the artists website or chosen image host."

The change to remove their karma was intended to rectify that.  I'm not sure how much of the current perception of self posts as being better than text posts, in general, is due to that, and how much is due to the evolution of reddit, but it appears to have at least stopped the immediate problem.  As far as I'm aware, we haven't spent any serious amount of time since then considering options for karma on self posts.  During my short tenure, there have been a few short conversations, but generally the perception has been that we have more important things to fix first, especially given the incredibly large potential shift such a change could make.  Feel free to suggest this in /r/ideasfortheadmins (or search - there are probably several threads on the subject) to get some smart folks' opinions on the pros and cons of such an approach."

If so, that makes things much more difficult to debug, since mobile browsers don't tend to have the same set of developer tools as desktop browsers.  I'd also in general recommend using the mobile website (feedback to /r/mobileweb) or one of the many native apps (I most like Relay for Reddit), but I don't remember which of those support subreddit creation.  Can you try using mobile Chrome or mobile Firefox?  We don't target mobile browsers for the desktop site, so your chances of things working well are much better when using a common rendering engine.

help,3cf0o7,allthefoxes,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:07:46 2015 UTC,"From the FAQ linked in the sidebar:   Why aren't my posts showing up?  The spam filter is designed to detect spam posts and automatically remove them. However, legitimate posts are often caught by the filter. If a few minutes go by and your post isn't showing up on the new page of the community where you posted, it has probably been caught by the filter. This is most likely to occur if you are posting to a community that you have not participated in before. Each community has an independent filter, for example /r/help's filter doesn't talk to /r/pic's filter. In order to remove your post from the filter you need to message the moderators (this link can be found in the sidebar on the right-hand in that community, you can also manually compose a message to #communityname) and ask them to check the filter for you. Eventually the filter will ""learn"" that your posts don't need to be removed. If your posts are frequently removed in one community in particular you can send a request to the moderators to be added as an approved submitter."

help,3b981x,largenocream,3,Sat Jun 27 14:01:12 2015 UTC,"AFAICT there's no safe way for us to avoid this behaviour while encrypting connections. The only way I can think of would cause HTTP/1.0 and badly behaved proxies (read: most of the ones used in schools / the workplace) to serve you pages meant for other users and vice versa.   We could maybe get away with changing the Cache-Control header so it doesn't trip the check at https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protocol/http/nsHttpChannel.cpp?from=nshttpchannel#3091, but we'd also have to remove the Pragma: no-cache header (see https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protocol/http/nsHttpResponseHead.h#49 and https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protocol/http/nsHttpResponseHead.cpp#834). I'm iffy about doing that because it's not clear if plain old Expires: 0 and Pragma: no-cache are equivalent. If Expires: 0 only means that user agents SHOULD (not MUST) NOT re-validate the resource before serving, you've got a cache poisoning issue. Add non-conformant proxies into the mix and you've got a big mess.  TL;DR: It's still an issue, and as far as I can tell there's no easy fix we can apply on our end. Your best bet is probably voting on the Firefox bug. Chrome and Webkit have already set the precedent for this behaviour, so I don't think the rationale in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=567365#c1 applies anymore.

Among other things, it's necessary to mitigate Firesheep-style attacks when you use public WiFi. These kinds of attacks are incredibly easy to launch, and the only effective way we have of mitigating them is to require HTTPS.  Opt-in protection is not enough because the people who are most likely to fall victim to these attacks are the least likely to even look into extra security measures. Fewer than 1% of all logged in users yesterday had opted into the ""force HTTPS"" option, but I'm sure that more than 1% would care about their account being hijacked or their activities snooped on when using public WiFi.

Both of those sites cause a refresh on pressing back in Firefox, and there weren't any workarounds posted for that issue. I was also being conservative about changing them because, again worst-case people might get pages meant for other users.

Once that's done, we can start sending Cache-Control: private, max-age=0, must-revalidate to a few logged in users to see if it has any effect on the number of users getting pages meant for other users.

So, instead (and again, if I'm remembering this correctly), we start with a blank list.  You make your first comment, we put it on there.  You make another comment, we put it on there.  This continues until you reach 1000 comments.  Then, we insert the new comment in the appropriate spot (say it's your 16th highest scored comment, then it'd go at position 16) and we bump the bottom one off the list.  For the next comment, we do the same thing, and so on and so forth.  This allows us to have a quickly-available list of your top comments: we don't have to figure it out, because we already have the list.  The downside is that we rely on the list being accurate - so if there was some sort of error, either a programming bug, or a machine shutting down unexpectedly, or any number of crazy things that happen all the time on a site of this size, we might end up with a mistake in the list.  And since we never go back and validate that it's correct (remember, that's so expensive we can't really do it), we just have to accept that there might be something wrong every now and then.  My guess is that your comment is one of those.  The time-limited top listings, however, are recalculated periodically, so if the comment was made within the last year, we'd see it in the yearly listing (or if not, we could fix the bug that causes it not to, and it'd be fixed within the week)."

I personally also find it to be annoying if it is not a self-post as that method requires me to click again to view the linked content.
help,3aixa0,Puggilicious,3,Sat Jun 20 17:12:37 2015 UTC,"Imgur is an ""image hosting"" site. In other words, they can take images from your computer and put them on their site, which allows you to link them elsewhere (like reddit).   Navigate your browser to http://imgur.com/  Near the top-left of the page, click the blue button that says ""Upload images"" (it looks like this) A pop-up will appear with four options. The easiest way now is to drag the image from your desktop into the window, like I am doing here.  Once you drop the image, the pop-up will give you a new option, ""Start upload"". Click this button. Your image is now uploaded to imgur! You should be taken to a new page that shows your image. On the right side, there are several text fields, each showing a different way of linking to your image. The two that we care most about are the ""Direct Link"" and the ""Markdown Link"". The Direct Link goes directly to the image — this is what you would use to make a submission on reddit (in my case, http://i.imgur.com/xWCzcwC.jpg). The Markdown Link shows how you would be able to link to the image in a comment on reddit. If you paste [YOUR TEXT HERE](http://i.imgur.com/xWCzcwC.jpg) when typing a comment, it will become YOUR TEXT HERE when you save it.   That's all there is to it! Let me know if you have any other questions :)"

help,3ahf1r,etym0n,4,Sat Jun 20 05:12:07 2015 UTC,"Firstly, a moderator can not delete posts, they can only remove them from a subreddit; the post still exists, but it's no longer visible in the subreddit it was posted to. This is different to when a user deletes their own post, where it does cease to exist.   And, because the post still exists when a moderator removes it from a subreddit, it's difficult for someone to see if their own post has been removed by a moderator - because the poster still sees their removed post normally, even though anyone else looking at it will see that it has been removed. The easiest way to see if a post of yours has been removed is to log out of reddit and look at the thread as an anonymous reader, not as you, the reddit user. You will then see the text ""[removed]"" on your post - like I see on this thread you linked to.   You can also look in the 'new' queue of the subreddit you posted to, to see if your post shows up there (obviously, this only works with recent posts).

We've moved from you asking ""why can't I see my comment under the topic, SOMEWHERE?"" to you knowing that you can see your comment if you scroll down further in the thread. That's a step forward.  Here are some hints for making your comments more visible, and therefore more likely to get replies:   Don't reply to old and popular threads. If there are already hundreds (or thousands) of comments in a thread, your single comment will be lost in the crowd. That's like shouting in a crowded concert venue or sports stadium and hoping that someone hears you. Ain't gonna happen. Go to the 'new' queue of a subreddit you're interested in. (There's a series of links at the top of every subreddit: ""hot, new, rising, controversial, top"". Click on 'new'.) Find a recent post that hasn't been swamped by hundreds of other people yet. Comment while it's still new and fresh. If you're one of the first people to comment, you'll get noticed. And, while you're there, upvote the thread you commented in to make it more visible on the subreddit's main page. If you do get to a thread which already has hundreds of comments, reply to a comment that's already high up and visible. Find something relevant to say to someone who has already commented, to join in the conversation. If you're interested in AMAs, look at the schedule in their sidebar (go to /r/IAMA). They usually announce their AMAs days or weeks in advance. Be prepared. Get to the thread early (use the 'new' queue, as explained above). By the time an AMA thread appears on your reddit front page, it's already many hours old - and the celebrity may have already left. Know in advance when they're coming, and be one of the first to post your question in the thread, rather than waiting until it's too late.   Try these strategies. They should help your comments get noticed."

Don't try to gain karma just because you're desperate or want attention, just do it to make the subreddits you visit more interesting.  If comment karma is a big factor you may want to contribute comments that other people like. You don't always have to agree with everyone on reddit, just make the effort to be helpful, entertaining or interesting. There's a subreddit for almost everything and it's not too hard to find a few where your content is appreciated."

Karma is stored (internally) on a per-subreddit basis; if you are new to a subreddit, you'll have to be patient. The delay will decrease as your karma in that subreddit increases and it only takes a fairly small amount of positive karma before the timer will turn off. This applies to both posts and comments. You can also get the timer turned back on if you make a lot of negatively voted posts/comments."

help,39v9ya,sudofox,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:28:26 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing this throttle was showing up when you posted in /r/Entertainment. I'll also guess that you're not a regular commenter in that subreddit.   Why do I guess these things? Because the posts you made immediately before posting here were some comments in /r/Entertainment - and the first of these was strongly downvoted. This would flag you to the automated reddit algorithms as a person who's posting unsuitable content to that subreddit. And, seeing as you don't have a strong posting history in that subreddit, it throttled you.   The time limits are subreddit-specific. You need to earn karma in each new subreddit to get around them. And you earned negative karma the first time you posted in /r/Entertainment.   Or you need to register an email address on your account."

help,39k6d5,Chicagooan,0,Fri Jun 12 08:57:40 2015 UTC,"I had a problem with my lawyer, I asked for advice.  I did not insult anyone on reddit, not yet a group of people.  Here is my last response on the issue at that subreddit;  After making a slight about ""public defenders"", which is just me being silly. I got a mountain of ""bad karma"". Which I really could care less. I mean look at my account, I have been here for 6 years, and I have barely used Reddit. Not really my thing. Too many restrictions and too many trolls. Right now there is a big falling out about fat people or something? I dunno, it's always something. Whether censorship, rule enforcement, or trolling. But I did want to give props to the Public Defenders out there. I am not one to be in trouble, and this is my first use of a public defender. But I realize that they get paid less, and typically do a great job. I just read this about public defenders. http://defensehelp.com/russo-russo-lawyer-qualifications/private-lawyer-public-defender I guess it is the work load that they must take, to make up for the lower pay that has got me upset. It's not their fault necessarily that they get too busy. But my only major problem is that last week my PD told me that he would be in court for me on my court date (pretrial thing), and then I called yesterday to follow up to find out a few surprises. He was on vacation and could not take my call (I JUST recently spoke to him, I had no idea) That he said he would appear in court for me, and I wouldn't have to drive 2600 miles to be there. That when I called, the secretary had no new notes about my case, and she informed me that I would in fact have to appear in court on my next court date, and that a lawyer would not be appearing for me, as I was just told less than a week ago. My PD only had to update his notes, and inform the prosecutors office. I mean nevermind telling me all of this about the vacation and such. But at very least, the appropriate people could have/should have been informed, so that when I don't show up for court (thinking that my PD will be there for me), that I don't have a bench warrant for my arrest. I mean it appears to me (and I have the conversation recorded with my CallX app) that no one was in the loop about what was going on with my next court date, and everyone that mattered was thinking that I would personally be appearing (which is not what me and my PD had agreed to). So now I get all of the hate and trolling because of my humor. ""public pretender"". I haven't defamed anyone, mentioned anyone by name, and all of my media is also censored with no names given. Come on, don't take yourselves so bloody seriously. I didn't slight you. But I do have a reason to be upset that my case is sort of being ignored, and that I almost ended up with a bench warrant due to no mistake of my own. You may sympathize with that. You may not. My guess is, there will be more trolling to come. Is this about justice or revenge?"

You made an offhand insulting remark about your lawyer in which you called him a ""public pretender"". I'm guessing this isn't the first time public defenders have been insulted in this way. Thus, other public defenders (and lawyers in general) were probably personally offended by that.   My guess is, there will be more trolling to come.   I doubt it. People were annoyed about your comments in that post, so they downvoted you. I doubt they're going to bother following you around outside that post. You haven't gotten a single downvote on this submission yet (though, to be fair, it is pretty new).  Also, I'm pretty sure people would have stopped downvoting you if you had just apologized for offending anyone, and made it clear that you only had a problem with your specific lawyer.

Every single post on reddit is a balloon - New post, new balloon, pretty much no helium.  Every time someone upvotes a post, a little bit of helium is added. Every time a downvote is added, a little is taken out.  In addition, as time goes on, (as a post gets older), weights are added to the balloon to drag it down, as well as less helium getting added to the balloon with an upvote.  So what happens is that, if a post gets 1000 upvotes in 5 minutes, it skyrockets. Insta front page.  If something gets 1000 upvotes over 8 hours, it will still get pretty high, but not on the same level. It won't be as high because it has some weights on it (because of time) and the votes it got at 7 hours in were not as powerful as the votes it got when it was 5 min. old.    So, what happens is, those 1 point 0 comment posts that are new are actually higher than yesterdays posts with 200 points, because reddit is adding these weights no matter what. So this new post, while it has barely any helium, has no weight or little weight on it.  Where as yesterdays post basically has a 500 pound weight on it, its not going anywhere but down."

How does one have something like an asterisk or hash show up without parsing as a code?  Like if I do an * on each side of a word it will italicize but how do I get it to just show the *?
help,38ysys,efrique,2,Mon Jun 8 11:30:02 2015 UTC,"Normally, you can just use \* to make a literal asterisk. The backslash ""escapes"" the next character so it will almost always display as-is.

When a post gets removed by a mod etc. it's just unlisted so to say. It's not visible on the subreddit anymore (at least not for the subscribers) but it's visible on your user overview.  There's another form of removal, the DMCA take down by admins. This is the only case where a post is completely gone.

help,34vszv,electr0lyte,1 point,Mon May 4 23:49:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I'll post over to /r/bugs.  I made a post to that thread I linked, and it also doesn't show in my comment history (userpage)."
help,34vszv,mattzm,0,Mon May 4 23:52:28 2015 UTC,/r/mturk is also having this issue today. I am a mod and one of the missing comments is mine. It shows up on my userpage but not in the comment thread. I've checked the mod log and it was not removed by mods.

help,34uaj9,Tim5000,2,Mon May 4 16:52:05 2015 UTC,"that means your account was shadowbanned from reddit, likely for spamming, since you said you use it to post webcomics only.  You'll need to message the admins at /r/reddit.com on that account to contest this, or, just don't spam in the future"
help,34uaj9,allthefoxes,1 point,Mon May 4 17:05:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I didn't consider it spam, since it was for the community, the comic's posted are usually met with some amount of discussion."
help,34uaj9,allthefoxes,2,Mon May 4 17:07:54 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, its not your call on what you think it is, its the admins call :P"
