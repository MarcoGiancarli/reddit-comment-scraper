wsu,3dxacz,XBOXeiner,14,Mon Jul 20 08:20:59 2015 UTC,"Minor recommendation for next time. When you post a direct exhortation like this, the reader is much more likely to complete the desired action if you do the heavy lifting for them.  Imagine the person you're trying to reach.  They aren't planning to vote on 8/4.  They probably don't know where to vote and/or how to arrange absentee ballots to their university address.  They may well not even be registered to vote.  Providing dead simple links & instructions to address these issues will make your non-voter much more likely than otherwise to vote as you desire.  That's the reason that get out the vote campaigns will go door to do and drive voters to the polling place if needed."

As soon as I got a third and we started paying for the 30 Mbps line (17 each) I have had an outage problem once in an entire year.  It also helps if you buy your own router and modem, instead of relying on their shitty hardware thatyou have to rent anyway.  Just my two cents. Consider it if you are rooming with a couple people."
wsu,3dvh19,XBOXeiner,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:48:52 2015 UTC,Watch out for some of the contractors that Time Warner hires. Some will tell you that you must use their modem. That's a lie. They're trying to get you to lease the modem which is a total rip off. Here is a list of approved modems: http://www.timewarnercable.com/en/support/internet/topics/buy-your-modem.html

I can't find it because TWC has been in the news so much. The jist of the tip was always re-up the promotions from them, and if they refuse, talk to a retention specialist instead of a sales associate. I was paying so much for service from them a year ago and called them. Now I pay $45 a month for 30 Mbps service."

wsu,3dszq6,sjwwjs,2,Sun Jul 19 04:07:29 2015 UTC,I'd say the best advice is to look at the pre-reqs you need on your own and make your own schedule. That way you can just show it to your advisor and they can change it as needed
wsu,3dszq6,ZDHELIX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:42:35 2015 UTC,I had Dr.Davis for my whole time here at WSU and he has done nothing but help and guide me at every turn. He was awesome and always went the extra mile for me. Some advisors can be shitty but I know many people who found a new professor who was always willing to help them with things like classes or research.
wsu,3dszq6,StandardCarbonUnit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:02:51 2015 UTC,I suppose it all varies. I haven't had any issues with civil engineering advisors. I imagine some majors have more students making it harder for advisors to do their job.  It's always good to consult other students and professors along with what your advisor instructs you.
wsu,3dszq6,ernst253,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:04:55 2015 UTC,"The general advisors in Lighty can be kind of hit and miss, but most advisors within departments are pretty legit. I met with Leisa McCormick in the English department and she was able to help me out of more than one pickle.   General advisors are great at helping you narrow down what you would like to major in, but you should try to get with an advisor that deals primarily with those students once you make the decision."
wsu,3dszq6,ShakingSquirrels,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:23:25 2015 UTC,"The general advising you run into before placing into a department do their best, but have LOTS of people to handle, and mistakes definitely happen.  My experience with the mechanical engineering advising was pretty good though.  I cannot speak for any other department though.  All that said, the golden rule is as follows:  Go into your advising appointment prepared with what you've taken, what your major course plan says you need to take, and a tentative schedule already scoped out.    If you're coming in as a freshman, it's a lot more clear-cut than for transfers, who sometimes have unusual credit situations.  If you are in this position, and/or are transferring anything other than simple obvious things like AP credit (e.g. credits from a quarter-schedule school that don't neatly align with WSU's semester credit requirements), verify everything your advisor says, and if you are working around any strange circumstances/requirement exceptions, be sure to get it in writing from someone with the authority to do so.  Caveat emptor."
wsu,3ds6mw,Eatbricks,3,Sat Jul 18 23:08:02 2015 UTC,"Go to the bookie website. Click search/find/get textbooks mear the top of the page. You'll then be directed to input course information. It will then spit out all the books you need.  Just a note, if it's recommended dont get it. Some professors dont even use the books so im some cases im may be smart to wait.   One the first day of class professors usually go over the syllabus and this includes talking about to book.  The bookie is the most expensive place to get your supplies. Crimson and Grey usually is cheaper but not by much.   Always shop around and check craigslist. Also if you know how to use torrents that's a nice free illegal solution.   I mainly use the bookie to just see what I need and try my absolute best not to give the school more money thru the textbook scam."
wsu,3ds6mw,ernst253,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:43:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed and also about when and if you should get your textbooks it almost depends entirely on the class/major if you even need the book.  I will usually feel the class out and wait a week before picking up the book (not to mention financial aid will sometimes take a bit on the disbursement of your excess aid, this is an easy excuse to use the first week if you do need the book but can't get it right away). If it's a math class with homework assigned regularly you will want to pick it up asap.  Other classes maybe not for a while or even at all.    Amazon marketplace is a great place to pick up used books for cheap as well."
wsu,3ds6mw,joecamo,2,Sun Jul 19 01:53:26 2015 UTC,"I normally never buy a book until the first week of classes when the teachers will tell you whether you actually need a book.  Normally a math class of any kind will need to book + access code to online homework, but I know some times if you buy the access code on whatever homework site, it'll come with the e-book.  Long-story short, I'd just wait till the first day."

I remember being able to get at articles via WSU when my other institution didn't have access, though, and I'm pretty sure that was about a year.  However, I think we can get limited access through the Alumni Association, if you want to pay for that.  It might be through EBSCO.  If you are moving to anywhere academic after your finish, you should have no problems getting access.  I believe Industry also provides decent access as well.

If you hear all three sounds at the same time, then you are not all making your respective noises in unison. If the guy on the other side of the stadium hears all noises at the same time, that means you shout, then the cymbals crash, and then he shouts.

wsu,3ce6ju,DJ_Roomba1,3,Tue Jul 7 05:28:25 2015 UTC,"You can get summer aid but it is only unused loans/grant money from the Fall and Spring. So if you used it all then you have to pay out of pocket for the summer. And summer full time is 6 credits, which you have to be at to receive aid."
wsu,3ce6ju,StandardCarbonUnit,2,Tue Jul 7 15:26:43 2015 UTC,thank you! just the answer i was looking for. i'll probably save my extra spring semester grant money next year and use it towards summer of 2016.
wsu,3ce6ju,PowerPC970FX,2,Tue Jul 7 16:12:40 2015 UTC,"To this effect, for summer term, there are some pass/no pass P.E. classes you can take for 1 credit to bump you up if you're short, FYI."
wsu,3cc9h6,Spookmaster_5,5,Mon Jul 6 20:03:23 2015 UTC,"No place to use it on campus.    The closest is the Snake River, near Wawawai, about a 30-minute drive from campus.  Spring Valley Reservoir is about 30 minutes in the other direction, Moose Creek Reservoir is a bit nicer, but about an hour from campus.   Once you're driving that far, you might as well go up to the South part of Lake Coeur d'Alene, which is beautiful, and easy to access.  Dworshak is about the same distance, and nice, but probably not as nice as Coeur d'Alene.   So, to answer your question, you'll need to have a car or find rides to get to any paddleboarding from campus.  We're here year-round, and it's a great way to beat the heat in the summer, but if you're not staying in Pullman over the summer, you'll have pretty limited opportunities to paddleboard."

wsu,3brudy,shagginshaggy,3,Wed Jul 1 21:26:55 2015 UTC,First Step never had any cable internet assets in Pullman. This won't affect you at all. The 50mbit packages use a fiber backbone and are delivered to apartments over standard wired ethernet.

The previous owner of the cable system went bankrupt and Avista took the cables down.  This shut down is not related to any of the services that First Step offers in Pullman whether the fiber/Ethernet solution to the apartments or any of the other services we provide throughout the region.

wsu,3be6ls,avboden,3,Mon Jun 29 00:25:57 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be transferring over in August as well. I'm 27 and in the same boat. My partying days are pretty much behind me. My plan is to throw myself into everything I can. Intramural soccer, Rec center classes, hiking groups, that sort of thing.   As for grabbing a drink, I've been over a couple times and Paradise Creek seems like the best place to go to relax, have a drink and watch a Sounders (or other) game. Every time I've been there it's an older crowd with like minded people. Let me know if you'd like to join sometime."
wsu,3be6ls,Predd,2,Mon Jun 29 20:56:19 2015 UTC,"I guess I should clarify more. I do drink, but I don't like getting smashed, and I don't consider ""drinking"" by itself, an activity haha.   Basically, I just don't want to be hanging out with all the 18-21 year olds getting smashed every weekend because OMG ALCOHOL :D   Besides, the stuff I like is expensive, and college is expensive, so scotch loses :( hahah"
wsu,3be6ls,NavyDog,4,Sun Jun 28 21:25:33 2015 UTC,Scotch always wins. A nice glass of scotch and a Cuban cigar is an ideal activity to me.
wsu,3be6ls,bobwoodshed,3,Mon Jun 29 01:47:25 2015 UTC,"Even if you don't drink, Rico's downtown is a fun night time hang out that mostly draws grad students and younger faculty.  They often have live jazz most nights, pool, and is a generally laid back atmosphere."
wsu,3be6ls,PowerPC970FX,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:55:14 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you'd enjoy Rico's, then.  It's very laid back and is definitely the nicest place to get a drink in town.  Lots of grad students and even some profs go there; as an older undergrad it's where I was happiest/most comfortable too.  Now living elsewhere, one of the things I miss most from Pullman was going to Rico's to share a pitcher and some bar snacks with my friends."
wsu,3be6ls,assoncouchouch,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:41:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what everyone is saying.  You'll see that you need to engage students through University affiliations.  There isn't much infrastructure outside of it, but there is a ton within it.  I'd suggest making a point to drive away from the Palouse once a month at least, whether you go east into Idaho, north to Spokane and all the lakes/ wilderness there, or west to the cities.  You'll appreciate Pullman more when you come back."
wsu,3be6ls,QuinnMil,-27,Tue Jun 30 15:16:25 2015 UTC,"Transfer. Honestly man, I spent a year there and the majority of people just aren't into going outside or ever really DOING anything. Greek life is massive and although I was involved with it (largely out of necessity) I can tell you it's full of huge egos and the majority of students seem to think that it's the ONLY thing that matters in college.   I visited many other colleges and I can tell you that none had a less active student body than WSU. There's really just an incredible lack of culture. (I guess that's what you get when 90% of the student body is from Washington, many of whom are born and raised in any of my small towns in the middle of the state.)  I returned home to attend school in Oregon and the people and culture and infinitely better. WSU is great if you really love getting drunk all the time and don't care that your town offers almost nothing but a strong Greek system.   I'm not trying to be completely negative, this was just my experience, and there's still a chance you will find a solid group of friends and be able to get passed Pullmans obvious shortcomings. There's a lot of charm in the small town, but charm itself wasn't enough to convince me to spend more money to be there for 4+ years.   There will be many who disagree with me, but like I said, I've seen and know many people from probably over a dozen different colleges, and WSU sticks out like a sore thumb when it comes to the question of ""so what do people actually DO?""  Just my 2 cents."
wsu,3be6ls,ShakingSquirrels,17,Sun Jun 28 14:19:28 2015 UTC,"So you spent one year here, participated in the Greek system, and came to the conclusion that the whole school was like that? Come on now, that's just being disingenuous and you know it. Greek life is very niche and not reflective of the average WSU student's experience.   I've had friends and colleagues from all over the west coast come to see Pullman, and they are always taken aback at how much it defies those stereotypes and how unique of a collegiate environment it is. This is mainly due to the fact that that the students don't go back to their parent's house every weekend to do laundry, as the commuter schools do.   I spent four whole years in Pullman after transferring, and I still haven't scratched the surface of what Pullman has to offer. To state that Pullman/WSU only consists of Greek life and drinking is not just false, but false on a fundamental level."
wsu,3be6ls,QuinnMil,-9,Sun Jun 28 15:49:29 2015 UTC,"I wasn't stating that it ONLY consists of Greek life and drinking at all (but I would also hardly consider a group that consists of over 30% of the student population, and every member of student government niche.) What I am trying to stress is that while yes, there may be many things to do in Pullman, it pales in comparison to colleges that are in actual cities, or at least not isolated an hour and a half from the nearest decent one.  I've been down voted a lot and I expected that, I personally am a city person through and through, so Pullman was never going to workout for me.  I don't regret my year and the school, I mad a lot of friends and definitely had fun, I am just trying to convey the experience and overall impression that I personally had. If other people loved WSU then that's great for them and I'm happy about it!  I wish OP the best of luck next year, really."
wsu,3be6ls,ThaMac,4,Sun Jun 28 15:59:33 2015 UTC,"You could have, you know, gotten involved in something that wasn't Greek. There are literally hundreds of student clubs at WSU for pretty much anything. It's a huge university, I avoided Greek life the entire time I was there and every school year got better because I found more things that I enjoyed doing (KZUU, Cable 8 and such). You didn't really try homeboy, WSU gives you what you put in which is a pretty amazing lesson in life I learned up there, and something that other schools might not be able to teach you. Not trying to be a dick, Pullman is definitely a love/hate thing for me but I really grew into the person I am today because of WSU. Socially sure, it wasn't great or anything but my future was set up really well because I was basically forced to do things outside of just going to class. Hell, I landed a nice job out on the east coast due to the strength of my resume and I seriously doubt I would have been able to swing it had I stayed in state and gone to U of O or OSU (I'm from Oregon as well). I didn't even have time to drink senior year because I was so busy with all of my extracurriculars. People who say all there is to do is just drink aren't trying hard enough."

Most apartments are under $500/month so they're affordable  While this is very true,  a good rule of thumb is if you are trying to avoid parties every weekend and loud music/drunken shooting,  be wary of any place with the direction designation of NW.    I've never heard of anyone getting their cars broken into, I see it could be a concern but I've just never had to think about it because I trust my peers that much.    There are break-ins, but they don't usually happen until late at night,  when drunks are making bad decisions. Usually this only happens on special weekends that bring parents into town.  That being said, if you keep your car and place locked, it'll be mainly for the honest people. Now i know that doesn't make much sense,  but it is exactly as Johnny Depp put it,  ""Dishonest people you can always trust to be dishonesty,  honestly.  It's the honest ones to watch out for, cause you never know when they might do something really stupid. ""    Be prepared for lots of hills; they're unavoidable.    Get a set of wheels.  Bikes make getting exercise easy and makes holds seem less daunting.  My only other advice is no matter where your classes are or where you live,  plan around getting to class half an hour early.

That place is unbelievable, and I wish I had utilized it more while I was there. I've never been in a gym like it. Tons of weights and its usually pretty easy to get on anything you need.   3) when I was a freshman I had a brand new Subaru Impreza and it had a sound system in it too, etc. My first semester I had it parked in one of the blue lots the whole time and it was never touched once. The next 3 years it was parked in my frat parking lot and aside from the one time it got egged randomly it was totally fine.   4) get a pair of YakTracks for the ice walking on campus!  Go Cougs!"

wsu,3aobey,Sinelnyy,3,Mon Jun 22 14:45:34 2015 UTC,"WSU won't put you in an apartment, they will probably assign you to one of the age restricted dorms in a single room. You can probably get a WSU owned an apartment but you need to contact housing. Give them a call. The REC is great, supposedly it was the nicest student rec center naitonwide at the time it was built but they may have just told us that to get us jazzed about going there. Its pretty slammed between 5pm to 8pm during the week but its the best time to play a pickup game of basketball / volleyball if thats your thing. Security? There isn't much of that, so many parking lots so little security guards. Didn't hear of break ins though. I'd be more concerned with vadelism if you park near greek row overnight on the weekend. Seen a lots of cars with broken off side mirrors and some slashed tires. Even a few broken wind shields and one card tipped on its side. However I parked my truck there all the time and never once had an issue. Join some kind of club, group, etc. its a great way to meet friends. Looking for work? I suggest getting a job at one of the dining halls, if you only want to work 3 times a week for 3 hour shifts you can and they are set hours. You can always pick up more shifts. Its a good way to make a little extra money (in my case a lot because I worked so much) and its where I met some of my best friends that I still hang out with after college. First thing you do when you get settled in is go put in an application at all of the dining halls and get your food handlers card this summer, should only take an hour so one afternoon at your local county health building. Also, get to know your professors / go to office hours, especially the ones in your field of study. They offer great insight, know job recruiters, and are usually more willing to bump you up to a higher grade letter if you are on the bubble and need a little ""help"". Get a sports pass even if sports arent your thing, football games are a blast even when we stink. Last of all have fun you lucky son of gun.

Having said that, there are a few older dorm buildings, like Rodgers is 21+. 2) The rec center is one of the highlights of my WSU career, fully loaded, huge, modern. I believe it is the best rec center for universities in the state. 3) All lots have frequent patrols, this means that security is fairly tight, but on the other side you will need a permit or you'll get a fine (I've gotten a couple fines, around 25-50 dollars per)! That's marked, on campus parking though. 4) Bring a windbreaker jacket. If you live off campus familiarize yourself with the bus route. Enjoy the sun while its there, bring vitamin D for the winter!

This is specifically for any substance that you aren't allowed to have in the dorms. Even if you never use anything if they catch you in a room with anything in it you will be held accountable. Also something that you will hear 100 times but it usually doesn't stick in your head until you fail a class, NEVER skip a lecture.

So getting in the habit of doing laundry at irregular times will help avoid waiting for someone else ahead of you or causing others to wait on you. If you leave a load of clothes in a washer/dryer and forget about it, it will be removed and eventually stolen in some cases if you don't take care of it.  Bathrooms usually have a more communal atmosphere, I stayed in Goldsworthy where there are stalls but some places like frats have no stalls, just a bunch of shower heads in a room and so you have to get used to it or wear a swimsuit if you want to be ""that guy"". You won't have a typical 4 years of college unless you see at least one or two man junks and a handful of asses, but I mean everyone's got one so whatever, right?

Floyd, Ph.D. June 20, 2015. He died in Pullman surrounded by family.   While leading WSU to unparalleled growth and success, President Floyd was privately engaged in a battle with cancer. He and his doctors were immensely optimistic throughout that battle. Though his prognosis and outlook remained positive, recently the illness took a more serious turn. Higher education has lost a giant, and the world has lost one of its kindest human beings.   Dr. Floyd’s brilliance and determination on behalf of WSU can best be understood by looking at his work. He led the completion of a $1 billion capital campaign for WSU, successfully built bipartisan support to create a new WSU medical school, and guided the university to its largest enrollment in 125 years. And that was just in the past year. The university’s accomplishments during his tenure are unprecedented, and his legacy will serve the people of Washington, the nation, and the world for generations to come.   In the interest of maintaining momentum on the university’s major initiatives, we have asked Dr. Daniel J. Bernardo, WSU provost and executive vice president, to serve as acting president. We have every confidence in his ability to lead our institution through this transition.   Honoring President Floyd’s accomplishments will undoubtedly take place in many forms. He loved WSU and the entire Coug Nation, and they loved him. Details on how and where we will gather to pay tribute to our leader, colleague, and friend will be forthcoming.   Ryan Durkan  Chair  Washington State University Board of Regents"
wsu,3aixro,huckthefuskies,14,Sat Jun 20 17:25:35 2015 UTC,He was an incredible president and an even better man. The best thing to happen to WSU in decades. He will be forever missed by the Coug family

The space was falling apart during the stadium renovations, since the IT building is right under the stadium, and jackhammers will take its toll on any building. Floyd stopped by one day and saw our working conditions, and he got the ball rolling on something the higher ups in IT and the CUE didn't want to do for whatever reason: move the helpdesk to the (virtually unused) computer lab in the CUE. His personal involvement improved our working conditions and reduced hazards to both us and our customers.  I wish I got to thank him in person, I had at least two opportunities to do so. May he live on through all the great work he's done."

He fought as hard as he could to keep tuition raises minimal, and in a few cases, prevented a raise entirely.  The man was dedicated to WSU until the very end, and made a point of showing it. From time to time, he would sit in the student section during games, eat in the dining halls, and would almost always stop to talk with students who said something to him as he walked across campus. He took the time to learn names, and once he knew yours, he would greet you by name whenever he saw you.  My interactions with President Floyd mean the world to me.

wsu,3ak8m8,youkickmycat,5,Sun Jun 21 00:40:37 2015 UTC,"I worked there for 2 years while finishing my degree. The most important thing is they want a dedicated person who will be there for a while (1 year minimum but that was like 3 years ago now might be more now) and will work 40 hours a week plus overtime. They also want someone who is honest, aligns with their values, and is what they think is a ""good"" fit for the floor. As /u/mattakasturty  pointed out you haven't mentioned your qualifications, your goals, why you need the job, what your plans are during or after etc. so I can't tell you if you are going to get the job or not. It is a very good job so it is competitive in the community but they are always hiring. They are very picky about who they choose.  I will say do not lie during your interview to get the job. I do not care how desperate you are. SEL puts a lot of time and money into their employees. The trainers both on and off the factory floor work hard to get you up to speed quickly. If you bail before a year (or what ever the minimum is now) you will be burning a lot of bridges. This job looks great on a resume, even if school takes you a little longer, you want those references and experience.  Also ProTips:   If they are still doing the assembly test it is brain dead easy. if you can build legos you can do the assembly test. Just follow the instructions and you'll do fine Doing SEL and school is do able if you limit yourself to a couple classes and work swing shift. It is not easy but it can be done. Look up their values, motto and stuff online. You will be asked about these at the interview."

I'm not saying it can't be done, but its very difficult.  In terms of if you can get hired, if you can rub two brain cells together, you should have a pretty good shot.

Trash bags are provided in the residence halls so you don't need those, but I would recommend bringing a garbage can. Even though your room will have one, I always found it nice to have two trash cans in the room. (Disregard the stuff about two garbage cans if you will not have a roommate.)  Also as far as the school supplies go, if there is anything on that list that you didn't use in high school (i.e. post-its or index cards) nix them.

wsu,3agauj,doomneer,3,Fri Jun 19 23:04:51 2015 UTC,"Just curious, how would using the liquid detergent work in a dorm? I use liquid at my house, but It stays right next to the washer."
wsu,3agauj,huckthefuskies,3,Sat Jun 20 02:08:43 2015 UTC,"You carry it back and forth from your room. I started by buying a medium sized jug, and when that ran out, I bought a bigger jug on sale and kept refilling from the gigantic one. I'm pretty sure I only had to buy more detergent like twice over the course of four years."
wsu,3agauj,mattakasturty,2,Sat Jun 20 03:33:37 2015 UTC,You keep it in your room. Probably your closet. You definitely don't leave it right next to the washer.

wsu,3agauj,huckthefuskies,2,Sun Jun 21 02:58:56 2015 UTC,"I lived in the residence halls for three years and I'm going to recommend pods. Hear me out. All washing machines either are or will soon be the same kind. It locks your clothes in until it senses there is less soap. Most people put in way too much, and loads of laundry have been locked in there for 2+ hours instead of the 30-40 minutes it should be. Go with the pods. Super easy."
wsu,3agauj,ShakingSquirrels,2,Sun Jun 21 01:59:40 2015 UTC,"My issue with the pods is they always left a disgusting plastic film in the machines. Maybe the girls on my floor didn't know how to use them right, but i had some stuff ruined.  OP, if you go pods, make sure you don't leave the washing machine disgusting af. Actually, regardless of what you use, don't leave the washing machine disgusting af."
wsu,3agauj,brasiwsu,2,Sun Jun 21 02:16:26 2015 UTC,I think that happens when you stuff too many clothes in the machine. Seems like the pods can't circulate around enough to disintegrate.
wsu,3agauj,ernst253,4,Sun Jun 21 03:01:22 2015 UTC,"Are you going to be in a dorm?  I didn't bring kitchen ware and I was fine.  Mini-fridge is a good idea. You can rent them down there, but cheaper in the long run to buy one and bring it with you.  Mostly all of the ""other"" category doesn't seem needed, except the pain pills and the hats."
wsu,3agauj,doomneer,6,Fri Jun 19 23:08:30 2015 UTC,"Looks like a solid list.   There is a Wal-mart in town so if you forget a little thing you can probably get it fairly cheap there.  I would have some good quality shoes with good traction for if it gets slushy/icy and you have to walk to class. Also a warm coat/pants. And snow gloves if building things with snow is something you're into, is for me.   But I believe we have one break before winter really hits, and then you go for Christmas so you'll have plenty of times to bring back things you need."
wsu,3agauj,ernst253,2,Fri Jun 19 23:43:18 2015 UTC,Would you recommend those straps that go on your shoes for traction?
wsu,3agauj,tryptophantom,3,Sat Jun 20 02:15:47 2015 UTC,I would recommend a good quality shoe that won't let your beer get soaked if you walk through some snow.  They do a good job of scrapping the sidewalks and such so having spikes on your shoes isn't necessary.
wsu,3agauj,annagrams,2,Sat Jun 20 02:40:46 2015 UTC,"Towels are provided at the gym, so you don't need a gym towel unless your dorm has a gym or something. I'd also suggest some of those 3M hooks for towels and things, or an over-the-door coat hook for your closet. I'm not sure what your major will be or if you know, but a calculator is a necessity for multiple math/science classes"
wsu,3agauj,mattmaldo807,3,Sat Jun 20 04:58:38 2015 UTC,"Few things to add: a dry erase board for the outside of your door (for your friends to draw on), a second set of sheets (even if they are the shittiest sheets in the world, my second set was $10 from target), Clorox wipes and cups.

wsu,3agauj,Sportsfan6216,2,Sat Jun 20 06:27:45 2015 UTC,"I would recommend bringing only one plate and one bowl. They're nice to have but you won't use them very often. A personal preference of mine was to have a good water bottle and a water filter for the dorm as well.   Your school list seemed very extensive. You can cut down on it now and if you really need something you can get it later at Walmart. Bring your preferred writing utensil, scissors, the essentials.   Some last things I would add include a desk lamp and a small flashlight (I liked to read after my roommate went to sleep). Also, some duct tape just in case, because it fixes everything. Finally, maybe some posters or team flags or something to make your room more personal.   I hope this input helps, good luck in your new adventure!"

wsu,3agauj,Nggawin,2,Sat Jun 20 16:37:50 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing not on this list that i'd recommend is a mini-fridge. Its best to get with your to-be roommate and see if they are bringing one, and if not, take it upon yourself to get one. There's nothing better than being able to wake up and grab a water bottle out of the fridge or being able to keep some string cheese as a snack when you don't wanna walk to a dining hall during a study session. Outside of that, everything looks pretty good, tho i would remove the cup and just pick up a bag of red solo cups, and go down to like a spork and 1 bowl as you won't do much cooking on your own, but if you find you need more you can always go pick them up. Also, unless you don't have a cellphone, i'd drop the camera, as you'll find yourself taking most of your pictures on your phone."
wsu,3agauj,hmmwhatsthisdo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:11:23 2015 UTC,"My dorm comes with a microfridge.  And I'm a amateur photographer, so I want the cameras. I might cut back on the dishes though. Thanks."
wsu,3agauj,Nggawin,2,Mon Jun 22 20:06:10 2015 UTC,Would anyone recommend bringing a desktop computer? I'm assigned to the Gannon's hall.
wsu,3agauj,hmmwhatsthisdo,3,Mon Jun 22 19:29:05 2015 UTC,"I brought a laptop and a desktop last year, as I like to indulge in PC gaming too much for my own good every so often and my laptop is an anemic excuse for a laptop. (Also, having a personal server you can keep on 24/7 and remote into is nice.)  If you're going to bring a desktop, you will need to provide a place to put it. There just isn't enough floor space to leave it on the floor, and the desks are barely big enough to put a laptop, monitor, and keyboard/mouse on there as it is. I picked up a cheap metal frame (I think it's for a drafting table) at Pullman Building Supply and had them hammer some plywood into the two shelf slots. Yeah, it's unfinished and looks like shit, but it works really well.  Also, each dorm only gets one port per occupant, so if you are bringing more than one Ethernet-enabled device, you will need a cheap Gigabit Ethernet switch. Don't get anything with brains in it, like a router or managed switch, as ResNet doesn't take kindly to unauthorized routing equipment.  Furthermore, since you're in Gannon, lock your shit up. If your computer looks remotely expensive (I'm talking lights, logos, etc.) keep your door locked any time you or your roommate isn't in the room. (Yes, some degenerates will even toss your room if you leave it unlocked while you're in the shower) Even better, pick up some sturdy cable locks (i.e. not the ones you can defeat with a pair of 18"" bolt cutters) and wrap it around your bed or something sturdy enough to keep people from walking off with your laptop/desktop. Yeah, the chances of someone stealing it are pretty low, but you'd rather not find out the hard way that you weren't careful enough."
wsu,3agauj,Nggawin,2,Tue Jun 23 04:23:29 2015 UTC,I only play computer games from time to time but really the only reason why is because some of the Adobe programs I need that I won't be able to run  (very well) on my laptop.   Thanks for the advice. Do you suggest I lock up the computer housing and case too? I have some pretty expensive parts in there that I would cry if I lose.  Is Gannon hall that bad!? Could you give me some more information?
wsu,3agauj,hmmwhatsthisdo,3,Tue Jun 23 04:34:21 2015 UTC,"Then bring it. You don't pay for power, so you can leave it turned on 24/7 without much consequence (obviously you should turn off any case lighting if you have it). Look into setting up something like Teamviewer (free for non-commercial use), which I use for remote control between my office desktop, my laptop, my desktop, my phone, and any other computer in the world with a semi-decent internet connection. It practically sets itself up once you attach your devices to an account (also free), and it lets you connect remotely from essentially anywhere in the world.  EDIT: I suggest getting a heavy-duty K-lock for your desktop if it's something you deem valuable. I didn't live in a dorm where theft was a problem (Honors Hall is pretty chill), but there was a fair chance I was going to have to live in Gannon due to me being irresponsible and not turning in my Housing application early enough. If I did live there, I had a heavy-duty cable lock for my desktop and monitor that would've gone through the desk (good luck pulling a desk with stuff on it out of a room), plus tracking/asset recovery software for my desktop, laptop, and phone in the event I had a roommate that was too drunk to use didn't believe in door locks or some other condition that made securing my devices an issue.   I'm not saying that Gannon is that bad, but it is definitely considered one of the lower-tier dorms on campus. Lower rates and a ""party dorm"" atmosphere tends to bring in more brazen drunk people, sticky-fingered druggies, and other varieties of degenerates. I know I've heard of at least one person that left her room unlocked while going to take a shower (granted, she was a ""long shower"" sort of person) and got her MacBook, an iPad, iPhone, her wallet, and some other expensive odds and ends stolen - about $3k all told. You probably will never have to deal with it, but it's definitely best to be safe rather than sorry."
wsu,3agauj,hmmwhatsthisdo,2,Tue Jun 23 04:38:48 2015 UTC,Could you add onto your response? I edited the reply haha  Thanks again!

wsu,3agauj,hmmwhatsthisdo,2,Tue Jun 23 04:56:58 2015 UTC,"Alright, so I'd probably have to put aside an amount for security then. In the end, Gannon would give me an amazing experience and shouldn't be much of a concern to me?  I've been hearing a lot of bad rap on Gannon but nobody seemed to be able to give me a clear answer on why exactly that dorm is so bad. Thanks for answering. I just wanted to know what to expect and make realistic expectations!"
wsu,3agauj,hmmwhatsthisdo,2,Tue Jun 23 05:34:31 2015 UTC,"The primary explanation for why people give Gannon a bad rap is, quite simply, you get what you pay for. The building is old, and was designed to house a large number of people in a small amount of space. The rooms are small, everything in the room is dated, the technical infrastructure is beyond capacity, etc. etc. Combine that with the fact that the it's the cheap(est?) dorm on campus and as such the population tends to be more of the party crowd, and you have Gannon/Goldsworthy in a nutshell. It's not like living there will suck away your soul and make you crass and jaded towards other college students, but it's definitely not the Ritz-Carlton."

You can get decent wifi from Frontier for 30, whereas the same speeds at TW are like 50 or 60.  If you're in the big group of DABCO apartments (Providence Ct., Emerald Downs, Churchill Downs, PIMLICO), I've heard a rumor that First Step from Moscow installed Fiber and it's fast and cheap.

The walls are paper thin so get pumped to hear your neighbors conversations if your room boarders theirs. It's also far from campus so the bus or a car are a necessity.

wsu,3a4fuo,JustTouchItNow,3,Wed Jun 17 04:03:48 2015 UTC,That's back-to-back titles for WSU basketball alumni!
wsu,3a4fuo,CougFanDan,-5,Wed Jun 17 13:57:35 2015 UTC,"Lil early bud. Especially with the way JR Smith is now  Also Gene Conley won 3 rings with the Celtics. And how could we forget Aron Baynes winning one last year.   Edit: Before OP edited his post, he said that Klay was the first Coug to win a ring. Also, it was posted before the game was over when JR Smith was draining 3s where a comeback was still somewhat possible."
wsu,3a4fuo,reptheevt,4,Wed Jun 17 03:56:54 2015 UTC,"Aaron Baynes actually has two rings and was a solid role player both years. <- edit: this is not true  Klay might not have been great this series, but he was during the entire rest of the playoffs and is almost universally considered the second best player on the Warriors."
wsu,3a4fuo,Hougie,2,Wed Jun 17 04:14:53 2015 UTC,I thought Klay played really well this series. Maybe not quite up to par as far as offense goes THIS game but he held up his strong defense.
wsu,3a4fuo,reptheevt,3,Wed Jun 17 04:16:41 2015 UTC,I thought Klay did well the entire playoffs. Although he did have a few games like tonight where he got into foul trouble because of dumb plays.

Sometimes pushing too many references to a single place in one song makes it sound super cheesy. I think this happened here. Maybe just make it more about going to college and having a sense of home/family, with a couple coug references? Idk, I guess that'd change the whole thing.   Also don't give props to a sorority and then associate frats and roofies in the same song. They are all part of one greek community and they party together pretty often, your white knighting on a Pullman anthem track won't get you pussy, I promise."

wsu,39x8fg,aFatalStabbing,3,Mon Jun 15 15:22:53 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Many RAs were like OP and myself. My defacto policy was, if what you're doing doesn't negatively impact anyone else, I don't care. One of the biggest party rooms on the floor was right next door to me. They were always quiet and respectful. When a friend/attendee vomited, they cleaned it up before the custodian even saw it.  On the other hand, when someone used rope to trap people in their room? No. We had the ""there is no second time"" conversation. Agreed. Supporting you is literally our job. If nothing else, try to be on a first name basis with your RA. Again, agreed, especially with a focus on the other RAs in the hall. RAs rotate night and weekend call, walking through the building(s) looking for issues and responding to lockout pages. Your floor's RA is quite possibly not the only one you'll ever deal with. Yup, yet again. RAs get a small budget and are required to host a minimum number of these to keep our job. There is almost always free food of some sort; feel free to pitch alternatives if you have  a preference. But please, show up to them occasionally if only to say hi, grab a bite, and walk back out. Part of our performance evaluation are how many programs we put on and how many residents attend.   I'll add two other pieces of advice, along these lines.  First, regularly say hi to the front desk staff. They will be the RAs or fellow students that need a little extra cash. (It's a good job, if you're looking for one.) It can get seriously tedious in that little box after a while.  Seeing a friendly face always brightened my shifts.  Second, say hello to and respect the hall custodians.  Those folks rock and do their best to keep your home livable."
wsu,39x8fg,nipoez,2,Mon Jun 15 17:23:29 2015 UTC,"I was an RA during my Sophomore and Junior years at WSU. I had the exact same policy. If you weren't hurting others (or yourself) I would leave you alone. I gave all my residents ample warning the nights I was on duty. If I saw you do something stupid while with my duty partner, I'll have to bust you. If only I see it, and it's not particularly egregious, it's the ""no second time"" warning.  Not all RA's are like us though. If you are going to party, just be careful or find a safe place to do it elsewhere. The smell of liquor travels easily between dorm rooms and the sound of bottles clinking is unmistakable. Most likely, your RA will not be an idiot and will know what is going on and that RA might not be chill. I had a friend who drank maybe 4 times our entire Freshman year and was caught 2 of those times despite being fairly careful. Those strikes totally messed up his year and brought his parents down on him hard."

It seems like all of the liability would be on the driver, not on the company at all if there was an accident. And if the driver's insurance company learned that the accident was caused during an Uber-style job, good luck trying to collect. At least Uber has some sort of commercial insurance available."

wsu,39s649,TwilightTwinkie,4,Sun Jun 14 17:35:09 2015 UTC,"The only way this could work is by totally shafting the drivers. Wear and tear alone amounts to about $.30 / mile, with fuel being another $.10-.15, so driving more than 8 miles means they are losing money on the trip. That doesn't even take driver pay into account.   Edit:   Haha, and they even removed/commented-out the copyright information for the website design and just stuck their own in its place, which is totally illegal.   <div class=""col-xs-6"">&copy; Copyright Coug Rides 2015</div> <!--div class=""col-xs-6 text-right"">Theme by <a href=""#"">ThemeWagon</a></div-->"
wsu,39s649,Auricle_,3,Sun Jun 14 08:34:08 2015 UTC,"Theoretically they could be using this as a base fee and doing something else to pay drivers. If they serve ads or some other income stream + tips as driver revenue and the $4 goes to the company they could be profitable.    Lyft/Uber services are an emerging market in general, there are many streams of potential revenue that have yet to be tapped."
wsu,39s649,cougrrr,3,Sun Jun 14 09:40:08 2015 UTC,"Good point on the ads. Unless ad revenue has jumped up significantly in the last few hours, I don't think this could be viable, though. This is either some sort of Business senior project, some sort of weird hoax, or somehow real, in which case it will just burn through its investment capital and be out of business by December.   Alternatively, their app could siphon credit card and bank data from your phone, and selling that info on the black market could help to boost their profits.   Even if they do rake in some cash, they will inevitably lose it during the IP suit from their stolen website."
wsu,39s649,Auricle_,2,Sun Jun 14 11:44:15 2015 UTC,"Well considering that the minimum Federal milage rate for driving your vehicle for business is $0.56 per mile, anything over 7.14 miles would be losing money for the driver/company if they only get the $4. Im not sure if being a ""Taxi"" would fall under other regulations, but I really don't understand where/how they plan to make money on this. Plus if they use a credit card, the company will be loving  about1%-5% on each transaction. Even with tips, i dont see it being worth it."
wsu,39s649,forever_grad,2,Sun Jun 14 10:25:33 2015 UTC,And that doesn't take into account the driving a driver has to do to get from the drop off point of one fare to the pick up of the next.
wsu,39s649,mattakasturty,2,Sun Jun 14 16:04:38 2015 UTC,I think the key is they only operate in Pullman so it would never be over a few miles. Uber does a similar thing in San Francisco; in town rides for a flat $7.   I'm pretty sure it's not illegal to take a free website theme and modify it. Kind of shitty for the theme creator but I think that's standard practice on the web to remove the ads from themes.
wsu,39s649,RobertoLond,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:10:10 2015 UTC,"It would really just depend on how efficient both the drivers and passengers can be. If the main business becomes a shuttle from the bars to apartmentland, with no return customer back to the bars, then it's a ~3 mile trip. Plus, obviously, the driver won't get all of the $4 so the breakeven point is even lower than the 7.14 miles or 8 miles listed above."
wsu,39s649,reptheevt,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:15:53 2015 UTC,That .56 cents he mentions is the .56 you can deduct from your taxes for miles on your car used for business.  I wouldn't use that as a break even metric.

wsu,39s649,avboden,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:02:45 2015 UTC,"Why would anyone drive for them? It's gonna take 2.5 rides an hour to make min. wage, before gas and mileage are factored in. It's gonna take probably 15 minutes to do a single ride, assuming you're picking people up at Mike's and taking them to apartment land, which seems like it would be the most common request. So since they seem to be saying tips are unnecessary (""you don't need cash""), the absolute best case is $16/hr before expenses, and that's if you get constant demand. If I can only make $16 as a driver between 12:30 and 1:30 on a Saturday night, I'm not gonna drive, because Wednesday 10pm-11pm certainly won't pay that much, meaning I either work a few of the least convenient hours a week and make $16 an hour, or I work 20 hours a week and make barely $10 on average. At that point I may as well work at a dining hall that has much better hours. If people do actually tip for it then it may be successful, but no one is going to work Friday and Saturday nights for under $20 an hour"

wsu,398bua,shesmilesfordays,4,Tue Jun 9 23:57:54 2015 UTC,"So I went to UBC for grad school. Spent the better part of two years up there.   The city is fucking expensive. Housing runs about 10-15% above Seattle pricing. I had a 300 sqft basement studio apartment (read no windows and refrigerator 3 ft from my bed) on the ass end of 41st street, and that ran me $800/month, and this was several years ago. Parking is impossible downtown, however the public transit was fantastic. The sky train and major bus roots run 24/7. You can be anywhere in the city in 30 min. When looking for an apartment I would say access to public transport should be your major deciding factor. The whole metro area is also very bike friendly.  There aren't any really bad neighborhood save for the down town east side (not to be confused with east Van, which is a fairly nice and developing rapidly), which is probably the most appalling display of crippling poverty and systemic drug use I've seen. Seriously, on a hot day, you can smell it from blocks away. Other than that most neighborhoods downtown and south of false creek safe, clean, and fairly suburban (this includes all the neighborhoods stretching from UBC campus east). The closer you get to water, and the further north you head, the more expensive it will be. Kitsolano, Cambie, Mt Pleasent, Dunbar, and Kerrisdale are all nice and fairly reasonable. You will find a lot of UBC students in these neighborhoods, so I may be biased.  Culturally the city is very Asian. Primary Chinese with some Filipino and Indian neighborhoods. The combination of Canada's historically relaxed immigration polices along with strong ties to East Asian trade have made Vancouver retirement central for the mega wealthy of china. I found that native Vancouverites are a rare breed as most have been priced out of the metro area. The ones that are left seem to be very financially well off and live in the downtown core or in the old neighborhoods. There are some bastions of ""traditional Vancouver,"" particularly Commercial Drive and Main st. which have a very progressive feel to them.  Beer is also ridiculously expensive. Easily 50% more than Washington prices. The bar scene is pretty shitty if you're poor. And for the most part unless you have an ""in"" with group of people to begin with, you will probably find it difficult to make friends. Vacouverites are notoriously ""cold"" to outsiders, but fairly lovely if you get a chance to know them.   All of the best activities are outdoor related. From may until October, Vancouver is probably the most beautiful city in the world. Their are bike trails and parks everywhere. The mountains are minutes away. The beaches are full of activity. If you like being outside, you will love this town (when it's not pissing down rain).  Weather wise, it's very mild. Figure about on par with Seattle. Maybe a bit colder on average during the winter, but it's nothing like Pullman."

There's nothing wrong with linux IDEs, but I'm imagining some situation like: You're in some intro to CS course, and you run into a problem that the TA can't help you with because he only knows Visual Studio. Those TAs are like sophomores (up through grad students) who did well in 121, so they're clever enough and they know the material but they don't know everything, and it doesn't necessarily mean they're great teachers.

Maybe people stay in some of the newer ones they built over on Colorado (or Cougar Way, or whatever it's called these days), but I wouldn't know.   I didn't live there personally, but I know a few guys who were there 4-5 years and others who only left their senior year so they could get the whole apartment experience.

I enjoyed that the hall made an attempt to put programs on that were actually interesting, but I was never forced to do anything. I personally LOVED the hall because it (by nature) was just quieter than other dorms. There were no incidents of people being drunk and annoying, or puke in the hallway, or what have you. Plus it's super close to campus. I'm personally a minor-nerd, so I loved just being able to walk down the hall and jump into someone's Smash Bros game. One thing that is true for the hall: if you don't try to enjoy it and make friends, you will probably hate it. If you try, you will meet some really cool people, and you'll probably love the amenities that the hall provides over a standard hall."

Get some heavy-duty cardboard or some thin wood and mount it to a wall, project the logo on top of it until it is to the right dimensions, and then trace around the logo.

wsu,38pvyz,CougFanDan,3,Fri Jun 5 21:48:06 2015 UTC,"There is one thing about joining a fraternity when you're already 21: you'll be automatically put in a ""pledge class"" with a bunch of 17-18 year old kids, which may be a little limiting for you (I don't know you personally, so can't say for sure). You'll be treated as a freshman, do more chores around the chapter house (which I personally don't consider hazing, but to each their own), and in general put into social situations with people 3-4 years younger than you.  Quite honestly, when you're 21+ in Pullman, the world is your oyster. If you have enough self-confidence to go out to the bars by yourself, or if you're living in a 21+ dorm, you don't need the social interactions or parties that fraternities provide for you."

wsu,38ly9n,Lilliae,2,Fri Jun 5 02:06:02 2015 UTC,"I'm going to try to work through these one at a time.  <caffeine>    I'm new to CompSci, but I'm interested in it, what should I get a start on this summer? I'm trying to learn Web Design as well as video editing this summer in addition, so pick the top 1 -2 things you think are the most important!   Learn C and C++, as these will be the primary focus of most of the CS program here. I'd suggest starting with C, as the progression here is C in 121 and C++ in 122. Both are taught by the same prof (Try to get Andy O'Fallon, he's a boss!) and your classmates will generally go from 121 to 122 as a group.          Coming in from running start, I did not get my AA degree, however I have the following classes that will transfer to WSU Speech(COMSTLXXX COMS ELCTVE), History(HIST 110), English101(ENGL 101 INTRO WRTG), English 102(ENGL LXXX ENGL ELCTVE) Math 106, 108 and 171, Music apprec(MUS 160 SUR MUS LIT), Philosophy(PHIL 101 INTRODUCTION) and finally American gov(POL S101 AM NATL GOVT). How much of these classes are actually going to be beneficial in speeding up the process to my degree (maybe by completing elective requirements or so   I'm in Honors, so I'm not fully knowledgeable on UCORE. However, I will tell you that Math 171 is required for CS, so that's one pre-req out of the way on the CS side. (If you can, try to take Math 182 [Honors Calc II] with Sergey Lapin instead of 172 - the class is smaller and Sergey is way better at teaching than any of the 172 professors). You will need to take PHIL 201 instead of 101, unfortunately.          Are the dorms really that small or is there room to maybe put up a T.V. and console?   Sadly, they are pretty small - Stephenson is one of the smaller ones, too. I believe there are common areas with TVs, so perhaps bringing the console only and hooking it up to a common area TV is a good idea.          I've seen some debate on bringing a bike. In Stephenson, will It be effective transportation (I'm athletic so hills aren't a problem) and is the bike storage secure? I like my bike and dont want it stolen.   I believe Stephenson has a bike storage area, but I'd bring a big-ass lock cable if you plan on using it. Regardless, most of your classes are going to be in the center of campus (a very short walk away), the nearest dining hall is across the street, and there's bus service for most of Pullman that you can use for everything else. Carefully consider whether or not you need a bike before bringing it.          Do classes generally have an attendance policy? not that I plan on sleeping in ;) ;) ;)   This is a mixed bag. I personally see skipping class as disrespectful towards the professor and wasteful of my tuition money, but most classes don't have an attendance policy. I would highly suggest not risking it - set some alarms and learn to love mornings.          I'm an avid Online PC gamer. What kind of ping will I be getting on LoL?   If you're playing on Ethernet, you should see some fairly decent speeds. I believe Stephenson has Gigabit-capable CAT5 cable with a 50/50 capped line per NIC, so you should be fine playing any games as long as you have the proper cabling. Bring a Gigabit switch if you have multiple computers, however - ITS only activates one port per person per room, so people with desktops and laptops usually get screwed over. Wireless here is a joke - don't use it for gaming.          Speaking of that, is there any LoL community/club at WSU?   I believe so. Personally, I see LoL as a massive timesuck and try to distance myself from it, but I believe there's a fairly large LoL presence on campus.          Does playing my music loud annoy everyone, or are we all good if i keep Pac and Nas on?   Most halls have quiet hours and/or courtesy hours for most of the day. RAs will write you up for blasting music, so don't be the person that everyone bitches out on YikYak for pumping bass at 1 in the morning on a Wednesday. Buy some good headphones (wired is best, as anything in the 2.4Ghz wireless range is going to get shat upon by the cacophony of wireless devices in a dorm) and be a good neighbor.          Should i bring pans (gotta make breakfast) bowls, silverware or anything like that?   As a freshman, you're required to get a meal plan, which gets you cheap food at the dining halls. If you eat 3 square meals a day, this will likely last you most of the semester. If you like to cook, then feel free to bring some cookware, but it's not required and will end up taking space.          Are mini grills all good for dorm rooms?   This depends on the specific rules of the hall you're in, but something like a George Foreman is not going to be an issue in most cases unless you're being unsafe with it. Actual grills (like, ones with fire and whatnot) are not allowed, sadly.          If i did want to go civil engineering, math and CAD all the way?   Anything engineering-related will be using a ton of math. Not sure on CAD though, but I think that's a question more suited for the Architecture students.   </caffeine>          EDIT: Some other bits of sage advice:   If you're going into CS, don't get a MacBook. Something like a quarter of the 1xx CS classes will inevitably get one and try to run Parallels and/or Boot Camp on it, and Visual Studio never works well with either. You'll survive with one, but you'll hate almost every second of it. If you're going into CS, make sure to really ride the advisers about credit transfers and whatnot. CS's advisers leave a lot to be desired, unfortunately - you need to hold your own and be proactive if you want them to get anything done for you. I don't know how RS/CiHS will affect your certification status, but make sure to ask your adviser about your Junior Writing Portfolio. Everyone has to do one, and you don't want to find out the hard way that your JWP is blocking you from registering for classes the on the day of your registration appointment."
wsu,38ly9n,hmmwhatsthisdo,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:52:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the info, it's always interesting and insightful hearing what others have to say about college, as I know Running Start is nothing like a university.  First off, any other awesome profs you can recommend? (or any ones to avoid if possible)  I'm definitely going to have to take calc 1 again if I want to do good in calc 2, as it's been a year... but, will they let me take honors classes if I am not signed up for honors college?  Ehh that's ok about the room size, I've got a computer and hopefully there is some chill room downstairs to spread out my notes. Was hoping I could have a single room as to give myself some space, but I bet freshman hardly get those.  I'll consider the bike more, because if it's raining and cold all the time I probably wont use it much.  I dont plan on skipping anymore really. I had my fun being a slacker at the community college here, but I want an actual education now.  That sounds awesome about the internet, 50 upload sounds unreal, as I only get about 4 here.   Yea, when asking this I kinda forgot about the meal plan, so I'm sure cookery wont be of any importance to me.   what did you mean when you said ""make sure to really ride the advisers about credit transfers and whatnot. CS's advisers leave a lot to be desired, unfortunately"". It sounded like they are lazy and unhelpful, and I'm really hoping I interpreted that wrong.  Ahhh man. Wish I had known about the JRP, I actually wrote a lot of highly marked essays last English class in the fall... I'll let you guess where I store my old work (hint: it's the garbage can)"
wsu,38ly9n,DongSandwich,2,Fri Jun 5 04:06:53 2015 UTC,"Don't bring cookware, the front desk will have it all for you to check out. If you're not in honors you can't take their specific honors courses (they'll all have HNRS prefix or something like that) but you can take classes that are somewhat advanced but it's ultimately up to you. They are harder but you might like that challenge. I personally wouldn't recommend it especially if you're not going for a grad program somewhere. I was an RA in Steph South and there will be room for a TV and console in your room, but there will also be a common lounge floor with a larger TV that you can hook up your console to and play with dudes on your floor.  Don't bring the bike. There's bikes all around campus you can check out if you need them and chaining yours up is a hassle. Plus I've seen tons of bikes with tires, handlebars, and seats stolen off of them in the storage area. Advisers aren't necessarily lazy they just have a lot of students, especially ones assigned to engineering majors. Request a meeting with yours ASAP if you're serious about finding accelerated classes and getting your JWP and credit situation figured out. If you put in the effort to meet with them then they'll work with you equally as hard. For calc, Remaly is great. For Bio, Verrell or Raymond Lee are the best ones. Chemistry basically has no good professors until upper division classes. Don't take Kirk Reinkens for Engr 120, he's a dick. Can't speak for any of the other UCORE classes as I'm an honors student. If you're interested in joining honors, also talk to your adviser about that. It opens up a lot of interesting opportunities and the classes are all really easy and thought provoking, but it might set some people back a semester if they don't get in first semester. You can apply during your first semester so if you're serious, aim for a high GPA. PM me if you've got other questions."
wsu,38ly9n,hmmwhatsthisdo,2,Fri Jun 5 04:30:54 2015 UTC,"Again, in order:   For CS, you're going to want Andy O'Fallon for 121 and 122. He genuinely cares about all of his students, even if there's 200+ people in the classes. For the other classes, try looking for an Honors equivalent to your course. Honors courses prioritize Honors students, but UCORE students can join if there's room. Class sizes are smaller, there's (usually) less tedious homework (but you have to actually pay attention in class), and professors generally teach better. I'd suggest not retaking MATH 171 unless you barely scraped by in HS/Running Start. 171/172/273 (and their x8x Honors equivalents) translate roughly to the A, B, and C of AP Calculus AB/BC. If you did well in 171, try to get into 182. You'd be surprised how much is review.  You can buy out a double room in most halls, but there's an additional fee associated with it (I believe it's $500/semester for Stephenson and G/G) - I'd seriously suggest against getting a single Freshman year unless you feel you need one, as you're likely going to have roommates sometime during your life and it's best to get used to it under the relatively careful eye of Res Life. Good idea. A bike can prove useful if you live off-campus or plan on staying into the summer (when bus service slims down significantly), but during the year it's sort of a hassle. Also an excellent idea. Especially with Honors classes, skipping is seen as immature and indicative of someone who is not here for an education. Remember that you're forking over a significant amount of money to be here - why waste it sleeping in? 50/50 symmetric capped refers to the fact that your bandwidth is capped at 50 mbps total bandwidth in both directions by the switches that service the wall jacks in your room. This allows up to 20 students to share a 1 gbps STP uplink with reasonable speeds, or 200 students to share a 10 gbps fiber uplink. With an older, more crowded dorm, you're not going to be getting that speed 24/7. You might be able to reach 50/50 at like, 4:30 AM on a school night when everyone's asleep. Newer and/or less crowded dorms with fiber uplinks to the ResNet hubs usually have better bandwidth per-user. I'd suggest getting a small set of dinnerware - maybe a plate, bowl, a few glasses, and some silverware. Not everything you'll be eating is going to be from the meal halls. To put it bluntly, most college students believe their adviser is the one person that's going to be in their corner every step of the way. Unfortunately, most college advisers are spread to thin to be able to accomplish this. This means that relying on advisers to get anything done is a terrible idea. I wouldn't call them lazy or unhelpful, but ""burnt-out"" definitely comes to mind. Make sure you are proactive with your education. The JWP cannot include work from HS/RS classes AFAIK - only WSU courses. This brings up another important point, however. Now that you're in college, a lot of the work you do can prove handy later. If you're a digital sort of note-taker/essay-writer/project-maker, look into something like Google Drive to host your files on. If you prefer paper, then just get a file tote and store it in your desk. Throwing away work you've done is a terrible idea."
wsu,38ly9n,talos113,2,Fri Jun 5 04:35:04 2015 UTC,"Just as an aside, the internet speed in Stephenson south with Ethernet was always very stable and I was able to reach download speeds of around 70-80mbps. It of course was closer to 60, but I believe the cap may be different. I played a lot of battlefield 4 this past semester and the pings on Ethernet were very good in comparison to WiFi which was not only unstable and slow but also suffered from very high ping in games."

wsu,38ly9n,Average_Joe_Stalin,2,Fri Jun 5 04:12:37 2015 UTC,"If you have the door open and have reasonable music on at a reasonable volume at a reasonable hour, then you're probably OK.

wsu,38ly9n,flyingwrench,2,Fri Jun 5 04:52:06 2015 UTC,"When I was in Stephenson (2004-05), it was gender mixed by floor (girls and boys alternated every other floor). Not sure if it's the same now...  My floor in Stephenson was a bit of a party floor.  Everyone left doors open, hung out in the lounge, music was usually on somewhere.  But everyone was generally there to go to class and get an education too.  Weeknights were generally pretty quiet, but weekends got a little crazy.  Just be respectful of your neighbors and don't be afraid to talk to them if there's a problem.  Also, in regards to question 2, you probably won't get too far ahead based on your Running Start credits.  Some of them may count towards electives, GERs, etc., and some will count for credit, but not fill any requirement (or be redundant with other required classes).  Plan on completing your degree in the standard 4 years and use the extra credits to provide you with a little breathing room in case you need to drop a class a few weeks into a semester.  I know I had a few semesters where 5 classes was just too much to handle, but I stayed on track because some of those random electives were already taken care of.    GO COUGS!"
wsu,38ly9n,ernst253,2,Fri Jun 5 17:28:46 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I don't know the answer to some of these but I'll answer what I can.   2.You probably can graduate a semester early if you stick with CompSci, maybe with CE. At the very least, you bought yourself some breathing room. If you aren't doing well in a class prior to final drop day, you can drop it and not fall behind. You only get a couple drops though so make sure it's worth it.    The dorms are small but you have room. Talk to your dormmate prior to getting there (probably tomorrow) and find out a little about each other. Also find out what the two of you have and can bring for the dorm. There isn't enough room for both of you to bring everything you own. (Unless you don't own a lot a guess) The hills are worse than you think but there are bike racks all over campus. Bring a good lock and you'll be fine. No but go you moron. You're paying for it and literally every thread about tips for incoming freshman has go to class as the top tip. It's because almost everyone has a class that they had to drop or failed because they didn't go. Just go. Make it a ritual, go workout after. Also you should start working out. Make a friend who will go with you every day. Everything is new to you right now and most people can think of someone they know that started working out freshman year and most of them kept up with it and are in shape after 4 years of abuse. No idea. 6a. I remember seeing a couple of threads for one, so probably.  If its not before 10am and not after about 10pm most people won't care. You'll have quiet hours for your floor though, just follow those and you'll be fine. Don't be a dick about the volume though.   8.No, for the most part you won't have a chance. You can't bring a hot plate and most RAs will get pissed if you try. You have to get a meal plan, use it for reasonably heathly food. Start using MyFitnessPal or some other app that can track calories. You'll be amazed if you've never tracked your food before.   No, they aren't allowed. If you go CE, you have to take up to Calc 3 or 4, I don't remember which. Yes, you should learn CAD as soon as you decide CE.   GO COUGS!"

Honestly from an RA perspective the building can be very fun if you get involved! There are always some sort of things going on there and you should usually have something to do if you're bored. The rooms are considered some of the biggest doubles on campus so that's an upside :) The building itself isn't the newest or nicest but it has its perks. Its a large building and there are tons of students there so you're bound to make some great friends! Like everyone else said super close to the Southside Dining Hall which is great. The major complaint is the walk to every where else on campus but honestly you won't really notice it after a while. I managed to wake up 5 minutes before class and still make it.

You can keep it at the racks outside.  For your room, you will 100% want to get and bring a powerful box fan and window fan on the first day. It will be hot and stuffy in your room. Also, it gets windy if you have your window open, so always take your key with you even if you are just walking to the water fountain, because your door will blow closed with the wind.

The location kind of sucks if your classes are all near the CUB or on the other side of campus but it's not that bad of a walk. Southside(I think that's what the Rotunda is called now? and Flix (is Flix still there?) are right by the towers, though, which is really convenient.

There are some things that I wish I knew before I came however.   bring an Ethernet cable if you want to stream video or play games like at all, the WiFi really is too bogged down most of the time to be bearable and with an Ethernet cable the download speeds are around 60-80 Mbps depending on the network traffic. bring a box fan because it will be hot and stuffy until the weather cools off. my room mate and I bunked our beds to save space and I highly recommend you do the same if you can. Floor space is a valuable commodity. the walk to class isn't really that bad but it is pretty much uphill everywhere from Stephenson so prepare for that. you will come to love the towers market I would recommend leaving your door open while you're in your room to meet with other people on your floor.

I was in a corner room with two other people in Stephenson South.  It sucked.  There was not enough room for three people.  I was also on the second floor.  It sucked.  We had to deal with people constantly walking through our hallway to use the stairs.  You could see in our room from the elevator.  We didn't have a lounge.  Our RA was on the floor above us.  Our funding for floor improvements got sent to the third floor because we were supposed to share lounges, but our RA always kicked us out of the lounge because we weren't supposed to be on a girls floor.   It's close to science and engineering classes, but pretty far from english, com, and history classes.    On the plus side, Southside has the best selection of food, and they are renovating the basement to have a pretty nice workout area as part of the New Bookie thing."

There can be a lot of snow. However, most of the year that is over kill.   I would recommend getting clothes that you can layer.

You will, however, need warm clothing. I'd suggest a thermal undershirt, some flannel-lined jeans (if you're a jeans sort of person, otherwise some long-johns or whatever), a windbreaker, and a few moderately heavy jackets for when a windbreaker is overkill. Also, get something for your head - a skullcap and scarf might not be a part of your normal wardrobe, but you will feel much better having them on when it gets bitterly cold. Don't forget your hands and feet, either - getting frostbite because you went to a football game in snow and 1-degree temperatures really sucks. Invest in some gloves and a good pair of waterproof boots (One of my friends got some waterproof socks, but he never said how well they worked).  If you're bringing a car, get chains.

There's quite a few people who would love to have a family rent their property instead of the stereotypical college student. I'd look on craigslist and keep an eye out for Military Hill or places near Sunnyside Park. Both would be ideal and still in Pullman.   I have a 15 month old so I totally understand what you're looking for. If we were staying in the area I'd be searching for a house or town home on Military Hill or near by.

wsu,37a45y,VRTemjin,2,Tue Jun 2 17:00:06 2015 UTC,"Former CptS student here. Here is my advice:   Your first CptS classes (121, 122) will deal with C, and 122 will begin to delve into C++. If your advisor tries to push you to take 111 (if it even exists still), decline and go straight to 121. Most of your classes will use C or C++ for assignments. After 100-level classes, your knowledge of these programming languages is assumed to be at an expert level, so stay on top of your languages. CptS 360 and 460 will be based entirely on C (not C++) within your preferred flavor of Linux, so be prepared for that a couple years down the line. Many other 300-400 level classes will give you more flexibility when it comes to preferred language, and 355 will brush upon many other languages (Python, Java, ML, and a few other tricky languages). Get a laptop, but since you'll use it in class often, no larger than 15"". If you try to lug around anything 17"" or larger, you are going to have desk space and battery life issues. This is what laptop I have right now but better, so that's my suggestion if you're going to balance budget and power. From my experience, having a touchscreen was not very useful in my classes. Bring whatever will make you comfortable and happy, just keep in mind that you'll be sharing a space with another person. A minifridge is nice, and doubles as extra shelf space. You'll only have a bed, a desk, a dresser and a closet, and there won't be too much wiggle room for much else. Scott-Coman might be alright for Freshman year, since it is right by Northside dining hall. But for later years, it is completely on the wrong side of campus, since most of your classes will be out of Sloan/EME on the other side of campus. Most of your other freshmen GenEd classes will probably be more CUE/Todd centered. You'll have a laundry room on your floor. You'll either have a regular machine or a ""high efficiency"" machine, so you may have to buy special detergent if you have a HE one. My washers were HE and also not coin-op, but you did have to compete with others on your floor for laundry time. Greek life wasn't for me, and probably not worth it for a STEM student. I'm not into partying and getting drunk all the time, and with your workload you may not have time for that either. My best college friends were pretty much the other guys on my dorm's floor, which were also a lot of the guys in my classes (Gannon-Golds was my freshman dorm, it's where a lot of the STEM students go I believe). All I did was set up Guitar Hero and write a note on my door saying ""come game with me"" and I made friends in no time. A bike can be nice, just keep in mind that there's hills everywhere. A lot of the major halls have some bike racks, but some other places you might have to get creative.   Keep your goals in mind, but stay flexible. My experience was that I found that I wasn't really as prepared as I could have been, and I was outclassed by my peers that had more passion than I did. Along the way I realized, is this really what I want to do for the rest of my life? I struggled and I didn't come out on top, but I was stubborn and tried to stick with it. I got a job at the (now CougTech) helpdesk and it was the thing I woke up for in the morning. But after 4 years of juggling both that and school, I ended up prioritizing employment over my schoolwork and my GPA dropped too low, causing me to both be on academic deficiency and lose my job. I was pretty devastated and I still haven't finished my degree.  Work hard and don't fail like I did. If you find that CptS isn't really what you're into, don't hesitate to check out other options. There's a plethora of opportunity."

Being just off the stairwell door, the other 3 chairs would be taken with half an hour. Usually with at least 1 or 2 more people standing and chatting.  The power of an open door is amazing."
wsu,37a45y,XtraSkittles,2,Tue May 26 21:01:45 2015 UTC,"I can provide some decent insight into the basic questions and the dorm questions as im a resident adviser on campus so i'll try my best :D! I'm no help for the computer science questions since i'm majoring in secondary education.  Stuff you wish you brought:  A bean bag? (extra seating is a must have)  Bring a pair of shitty $2 flip flops that you wear in the shower  A laundry basket, I had a bag but no basket and it was a little difficult.  Extra deodorant/toothpaste/cologne stuff like that  Reusable utensils (forks,knives,spoons, plates, bowls..etc...)  As far as laundry goes, i'm not 100% sure on how scotty-co works but basically each floor will have anywhere from 1-5 washers and dryers on each floor. If you're in a building that only has 1 washer and dryer then more than likely there is a room somewhere in your building with a bunch of washers and dryers. Laundry is 100% free for you all you have to supply is detergent and stuff like that. You don't need to pay to work the washers and dryers.  Thoughts on scotty-co: Okay so i had a couple buddies that lived there last year and i must say their floor was some of the most connected group of guys i've ever hung out with, and NONE of them were in greek life. The rooms are HUGE at scotty-co. Like the biggest doubles on campus so thats a benefit. It is co-ed which is nice. I've heard a lot of great things from the RA's from Scotty-Co last year so you should have a good time there if you end up there.  So i didn't rush either, and i had a fantastic first year however i'm a rather open person and i get to know people easily. I as well kept a small tight knit group of friends and it was wonderful. Instead of rushing i decided i'd become an RA and i haven't regretted it at all. There are ALWAYS things to do on campus regardless of whether or not you are in a frat. Your floor will be the people you become the closest with, they will be some of your best friends and as long as you are willing to keep your door open while you're studying or hanging out you will make friends.  As far as having your own bike i didn't and i never used the green bikes on campus and i managed just fine! The walking is not as big of a deal as you may think, a lot of people will make it seem like such a damn ordeal to walk 10 minutes, it really isnt. The only time you want to inflict self harm while walking is going to be the winter LOL.  As far as the destiny community i can not say for sure, however, there are always guys in the dorms who will have xboxs and game stations so i wouldn't doubt if there are some people who play!  If you have any other specific questions regarding residence life or any other questions about campus or anything at all don't hesitate to DM me here on reddit. Maybe we'll kick it next year sometime!! :D Welcome to WSU and as always GO COUGS! Side note don't be that freshman who doesn't say go cougs back, if someone says it to you while you're there say it back.  Edit: There are many bike racks out side of almost all the residence halls i believe and it is completely free to use just bring your bike lock :)"
wsu,37a45y,nipoez,2,Tue May 26 08:37:16 2015 UTC,"Computer Science Questions   WSU's curriculum is mostly C based.  Intro courses will primarily involve writing command line programs.  Learn C, makefiles, and the linux command line. Focus on the command line first. Though not course related, I recommend learning git to manage course code. I went through CS with the cheapest mac laptop available. Battery life is great, they're lightweight, and the command line is built in. (Though I still recommend compiling on a linux server or virtual machine, which is where coursework will be graded.) You get a student discount, if not much.   Dorm Life Questions   Flip flops and a shower caddy. A separate bathroom caddy for any grooming supplies if needed (shaving cream, razors, etc). Laundry soap and a basket/hamper that's easy to move around. If you don't know how to do laundry, have your parents teach you now. Lots of ruined clothes early in the year. I was an RA in Scott-Coman and loved the community. That was a decade ago though. Can't speak to what it's like now. The walk from Scott-Coman to most CS courses is fine, though you will literally walk uphill both ways through snow. Scott-Coman floors have a dedicated utility room on each floor with the laundry machines. Circa 2005, that was 1 washer/drier per floor. It's up to the RA/floor to choose how to manage that. My female floor had a whiteboard schedule. My male floor was a free for all, with a whiteboard to sign up as ""next"". In general in the dorms, laundry is free but nothing is provided beyond the machines. Exact location and quantity depends on the hall.   College Life Questions   WSU is not a greek centric school, unless you get into high levels of student government. I had a close group of friends from the CS program. I joined the student IEEE, ACM, and Linux Users Group. Between them, the dorm, and study groups, socializing was doable as a reserved person. Other friends had great experiences with lifestyle and religious organizations. If you find a fraternity that you connect with well, that's great. If you don't, that's fine, too. If you don't have a car, a bike is very useful for getting away from campus.   I have three pieces of advice, after working as a software engineer and web developer for a decade.   You are currently in your late teens or early twenties. Your body will never be as responsive as it is right now. For the rest of your life, it will be harder to lose weight and improve fitness. Find something physical that you enjoy doing; running, biking, lifting, dancing, gymnastics, swimming, whatever. Exercise also provides endorphins, which are a huge boon during stressful periods. Scoffing at the gym is one of my very few regrets from college. WSU offers 1 credit pass/fail PE courses. They are amazing. Taking them adds $0 to your bill and provides a great, no-expectation way to learn new skills. Being able to write and speak clearly on complex topics is invaluable in software development. It is also a shockingly rare skill. I honestly get more use out of writing and public speaking courses than many CS major courses. A few hours ago, I was presenting a plan to spend hundreds of billable hours integrating two highly complex, competing systems to a group of 10 people including an executive (whose computer skills cap out at answering email) and a technical lead from one of the two systems; at the end, the executive understood what they'd be spending money on and the technical lead saw no issues that would prevent moving forward."
wsu,37a45y,tiptuppington,2,Tue May 26 20:55:37 2015 UTC,"I'm an ME, so unfortunately I can't speak too much to your major, but here goes: -Don't know anything about programming, but I know that my CS friends benefitted from knowing Python. Honestly, even just knowing a little bit puts you ahead of probably 50% of students. -I personally bought a cheap gaming laptop, and I would HIGHLY recommend what I got: a Lenovo Y50. It's beastly and insanely affordable, and great for carrying to campus. It should more than meet requirements for your classes, and if you're into gaming then it's just that much better. -I think that you'll find that Scott Coman is a little further away from the majority of your classes than the south side campus dorms. - Buy detergent, and the laundry may or may not be coin op depending on the dorm. - I didn't do a frat, and I had a hard time meeting really close friends, but that's ENTIRELY my fault. I chose to hangout with friends I already knew from high school, and didn't put enough effort into meeting new people. I have a ton of friends from various engineering classes, but I never got any close friends just because I didn't put effort it. It's as simple as that: if you try, you'll make friends. Greek or not. -I have not once needed a bicycle really. The bus system is excellent.  -My personal advice: don't freak out unless you are getting grades below average. In the CS/Engineering classes, some profs LOVE to make you feel like you're failing. Maybe I can't speak entirely to CS, but I've been through more than a couple classes where (on average) every single student was failing until the final grades went it, and everyone ended up with B's.  -If you have the grades for it, do honors. I met a ton of really cool people through there, and got a lot of opportunities. The classes are also guaranteed A's pretty much."
wsu,37a45y,leftatrium,1 point,Tue May 26 21:07:41 2015 UTC,"I lived in Scott Coman and it was a great hall.  Positive Sides:  * Proximity to Rec and Cub, it's about as close to both as you can get at the same time. * Proximity to Northside Cafe and Market, unequivocally the best dining hall on campus. * Largest rooms on campus. * Bathrooms aren't disgusting. * People from all sorts of majors, great hall unity.  * Laundry (washer/dryer) on each floor that is free to you (you pay for it in your housing fees). I almost never had a problem with waiting for laundry. You will need your own detergent. * There is also an ironing board, microwave, sink, and toaster in the laundry room for you to use. * 2nd floor (male floor) has a lounge with a full kitchen, tables, TV, and a balcony that overlooks the soccer field. In the fall everyone would watch the soccer games from up there! * A pretty quiet location. There isn't too much Greek noise but you can hear the occasional party at the Baseball house or people making noise between the buildings at night coming to/from greek row or apartment land.  Negative Sides:  * If you bring a vehicle your nearest lot is going to be Gray 1 by Beasley. It is ~10 min walk, which is kind of annoying. The pass is also expensive. * No elevator. There are ramps for move in/out. The only people who use the ramps for going upstairs are the women on the first floor, otherwise it is faster to just take the stairs. * Can be a pretty long uphill walk from some classes. * No study rooms (but there are 3 lounges in each building).  Having your own bicycle is ABSOLUTELY worth it. I had mine for 2nd semester only and I WISH I could have had it for fall as well."

wsu,35ufpv,ernst253,3,Wed May 13 16:37:34 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you are taking. In a normal semester you get about a month between tests, in the summer you will get a week and a half to two weeks. I took only biochem over the summer once and it was pretty brutal. I couldn't imagine taking a second class. Same goes for ochem which my roommate had taken over the summer. If they are easy classes it's probably no big, but just remember you have class everyday and it can get nuts trying to study for all those tests."
wsu,35ufpv,Shane_the_P,3,Wed May 13 16:50:44 2015 UTC,"One things to remember is how expensive summer session is. You pay for EVERY credit you take, as opposed to paying for full time during the normal semesters.  Since the cost is the same for anything from 12 to 18 credits during the rest of the year, you can essentially take classes for free that would have cost you in the summer.  Just something to consider if you're worried about finances."

wsu,35sfgg,PoppedButtercorn,2,Wed May 13 06:10:20 2015 UTC,Yes I think you have access to the online portions of the software. There are also free alternatives that work quite well as long as you don't need specific Microsoft office utilities.

wsu,35qwdu,throwaway493342,2,Tue May 12 19:42:20 2015 UTC,you should talk to the transfer advisor. he was really helpful for me. his name was austin   found the e-mail austin.jasienski@wsu.edu
wsu,35qwdu,killingit45,1 point,Tue May 12 21:30:34 2015 UTC,"Getting into CS at WSU is not hard, although maybe it has changed in the two years since I was admitted to the program, I don't know. There is definitely some activity in computational linguistics going on in the CS dept, although I forget the specific professor who is working on it.   I think that WSU will PROBABLY only take the final grade for your classes into account when determining whether to accept you, but I can't say for sure, I'd take the other guy's advice and email the advisor and see if you can make sure that your application gets treated that way. The difference between a 2.3 and a 3.4 for applying to WSU is the difference between a maybe and a definitely, so I would push on that if I were you.  Once you get accepted and join the program, I highly recommend you IMMEDIATELY involve yourself in some extracurricular activities and clubs. When I transferred they told me that something like 80% of transfers drop out and gave me the same advice. I took their advice and joined a bunch of clubs and stayed for 3 years and graduated on time. I never saw a single other person from my orientation group past after the first year, I don't think they made it. Being a transfer means that you don't have your social life handed to you on a platter like incoming freshman. You will have to carve a place for yourself out of what you are given to work with. Good luck!"
wsu,35qwdu,afschuld,1 point,Tue May 12 21:42:19 2015 UTC,"I gave them an email and was told ""We will look at your most recent grade in the course, not necessarily which one is higher"". This is great news for me and I now feel secure in knowing I can almost definitely attend WSU if I chose to. Thank you so much for your help.  How does finding internships work at WSU? UW's location is nigh unbeatable in that regard, but I wouldn't expect to get into their CSE program - even star students get rejected purely from lack of space."
wsu,35qwdu,afschuld,1 point,Wed May 13 00:39:26 2015 UTC,"So I'm not going to lie, you will have to take a lot of your own initiative to find internships to do, and I should definitely stress that you WILL want to do internships, it helps a lot. That being said, very few of the people I knew who were actively working at getting an internship their junior years failed to get one.   As far as getting work study type internships through the school, a lot of those opportunities aren't super well advertised, so it helps to know people and keep your ear to the ground. Hang out with the student groups and in the student lounges and you will usually hear of opportunities when they come along."
wsu,35qwdu,skyfly3r,1 point,Wed May 13 05:47:49 2015 UTC,"Hello there! You just described the story of my life (except of a different major). I just went through the whole process and got into WSU for this fall.   WSU will only look at classes that are 2.0 and above. Any class that was below 2.0 that you retook will be counted as your repeated grade. Any class that was above 2.0 that you retook for a higher grade will be counted as your ORIGINAL grade.   For example, I had one class at 1.8 and I retook it for a 4.0, and WSU counted the 4.0. I had a 2.1 in another class and retook it for a 4.0, and WSU counted the 2.1.   In my case, I had A LOT under 2.0 so retaking all those classes helped. If most of the classes you've retaken were originally between 2.0-2.5, that's not going to help much. If most of them were W and 0.0, you're actually in really good shape. Does that make sense?   I got in with a 3.6 GPA with the last few quarters being all above 3.9. So yes. They do look at your history and they do take into consideration where you come from. They're people too. They get it. And if you see you worked hard, they acknowledge that.   Also, once you're accepted at WSU, your GPA starts over from scratch. Your transfer GPA will have no effect on your WSU GPA.   If you have any other questions, ask! I'll be glad to help as I've gone through the exact same thing. Oh, and I'll be 24 this fall so I'm even there with you age-wise. Did you know that at 24 you get counted as independent for Financial Aid, which means you'll most likely get most of your tuition covered?   Seriously. Dude/dudette. Ask me anything else! I'd love to help! :)"

wsu,35gx4h,ChemicalOle,5,Sun May 10 06:16:00 2015 UTC,Every CC in the state has what they call a Direct Transfer Agreement with every public 4-year university in WA. It essentially guarantees admission for transfer students with an approved Associate's degree.  It is a general Associate of Arts and/or Science. The thing to do is to look at which courses that will be required for your planned major at WSU are available at the CC you are looking at. Then use those courses to help fulfill the requirements of the Asscociate's.  See here:  http://www.sbctc.ctc.edu/college/_e-transferdegrees.aspx  and here:   http://admission.wsu.edu/transfer/associates.html  Check course equivalencies:  https://old-www.wsu.edu/psportal/pages/transfercoursesearch.html
wsu,35gx4h,ChemicalOle,2,Sun May 10 09:24:24 2015 UTC,Thanks for the resources and answer. My main concern was that most of the community colleges near me don't have a finance option.
wsu,35gx4h,sillyribbit,3,Sun May 10 18:56:54 2015 UTC,"You won't find upper division major classes (e.g. finance specialization) for any field. But you can get all the major-specific certification classes out of the way.  Certification into the major is the term used for formally declaring a major and being accepted into the specific university academic program for that major.  For the finance major at WSU, the following courses are required to certify into the major:   CERTIFYING INTO THE MAJOR Students on all campuses must meet the following requirements to qualify for certification into a business major: Complete the following certification courses with a GPA of 2.50 or better (EconS 101 and 102, Engl 101, Acctg 230 and 231, B Law 210, MgtOp 215, Math 201 and 202, MIS 250) Have a cumulative WSU GPA of at least 2.5 Have earned at least 60 credits   http://admission.wsu.edu/academics/fos/Public/field.castle?id=7602  Now look at what courses at community colleges fit those as equivalents.  For example at Clark College (I saw your other comment that you are in Vancouver):   Clark College: WSU Courses-->Business Equivalents through Summer 2015 ACCTG 230  --> ACCT& 201 AND ACCT& 202 ACCTG 231 --> ACCT& 203 BLAW 210 --> BUS& 201 MGTOP 215 --> BUS 203 AND 204 OR MATH 203 AND 204 MIS 250 --> CTEC 205 ENGL 101 --> ENGL& 101 ECONS 101 --> ECON& 201 ECONS 102 --> ECON& 202 MATH 201 --> MATH 105 MATH 202 --> MATH& 148   http://business.wsu.edu/documents/2015/02/transfer-equivalencies.pdf  Now look at what DTA degree at Clark College will allow you to use most or all of those courses as part of  your CC graduation requirements. It appears that the Business DTA/MRP (AA) program at Clark offers just that.   http://www.clark.edu/academics/programs/bus/business_administration.php  Voila!  Completing that degree at Clark would allow you to graduate with an Associate's degree, gain admission to WSU, and certify into the business major at WSU--where you can now take upper division classes in your finance specialization. Of course it should go without saying that you want to have as high a GPA as possible to make yourself an attractive candidate.  Be sure to speak with admissions/academic advisors at both CC/WSU/WSU College of Business to make sure that you will be on track to meet those goals. It is usually required that you do so before you can register for classes anyways. Their job is to assist you in that process.  Cheers! and GO COUGS!  EDIT: Just thought about it and I assumed that you would want to go to WSU-Pullman, however if you are in Vancouver, WSU Vancouver also offers a BA in finance. The requirements are likely the same. Again, get help with all of this from an advisor at the school. http://business.vancouver.wsu.edu/finance"
