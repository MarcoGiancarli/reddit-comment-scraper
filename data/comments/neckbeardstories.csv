AC2 was fantastic, brotherhood was alright, revelations was ok, AC3 was shit, black flag is a fucking masterpiece and unity is shit. At this point every other Assassin's Creed game is good.   The campaign really was. Apathetic high schoolers combined with die hard conservatism and religious fundamentalism is an interesting combination. My city was one of those places that believed Obama was from Kenya and a Muslim. Oh and that he was legitimately planning on taking over America. I am not making that up. All the debates and questions from the campaign could be a story of its own."

neckbeardstories,3dzsh0,Nano163LoL,2,Tue Jul 21 21:15:16 2015 UTC,"Dang he doesn't even understand the quote ""Nothing is true, everything is permitted"""
neckbeardstories,3dzsh0,ruminating,2,Tue Jul 21 18:30:30 2015 UTC,"Somebody doesn't anyway. This quote is also from the novel, Alamut reappropriated by this game. This book is usually thought of as literary canon, but now one cannot look up anything related to this book, or more specifically this phrase without wading through a bunch of links concerning Assassin's Creed. The phrase itself, and the gist of the story mostly has to do with the death of religion an with it the old political structures of monarchy and nobility as a binding social phenomenon that people were encountering at the beginning of the 20th century and what the absence of this means in terms of the whole ""He who does not believe in god will believe in anything."" problem emerging and expressing itself as new and ambitious political movements such as Communism, Anarchism, Fascism, even the liberalism(capitalism) that had made its home in the USA was seen as entirely ""brave new world"" stuff especially by the old world Europeans that still had a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd estate.  It's kind of a shame because it is a pretty good quote as far as that whole theme goes, but now it(as well as the entire book, as the game drew from this book to the point that any content close to inspired should be attributed to this book and not the writers of the game) almost seems meaningless. Even OP's reaction to the quote was that it was a lame reference to a game that has no value but for cheap entertainment. And our neckbeard friend of course, even thinking of himself as an Anarchist(despite being sexist) seems to have missed the point as well, and assumes this is original content from a mediocre game franchise. Which is interesting, because if he was truly interested in Anarchism, Alamut is one of those books that could be right up his alley, or for anyone interested in the kind of critical theories that emerged from existentialism."
neckbeardstories,3dzsh0,Nano163LoL,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:09:05 2015 UTC,It's kind of interesting the story of the game (Assassin's Creed) Deals completely with the quote. They derived much of their story from the idea behind it

neckbeardstories,3de37w,gayezrealisgay,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:22:44 2015 UTC,"Man, that reminds me of the worst mistake I ever made. I played magic when it first came out here in Germany (I think he imported the cards himself or something, cause officially they where not even sold here yet) and was this cool niche game hardly anybody knew. It was the end of 93 or the beginning of 94. I was hooked and had a HUGE collection (2 sets of beta, 1 set of unlimited, 1 set of Arabian Nights, 1 set of Legends, 1 set of Antiqueties and one set of The Dark). Then the friends I played with went to university, and I had nobody to play, so I sold my whole collection and that was roughly 6 months to a year before prices started to explode since it suddenly became a big hit. My collection would now EASILY be worth north of 50k, and that is a realistic asking price, not the list price. I had 4 moxes of each color, 4 black lotus etc.etc.etc. (that was before they where restricted), tons of double lands (volcanic islands, tropical islands and Taigas. I did not even use normal lands ;).  Selling them when I did was the biggest mistake of my life, but how could anyone possibly know that ? How could I know that Lotuses jumped from 20bucks when I sold them to over 300 not even 3 years later. The joke is, back when I began neither the Lotus nor the Moxes where so sought after, I once exchanged a Black Lotus AND a Mox for the last Double Land I needed. Those where like real money back then, for double lands you could get everything even unopened packs from people, cause everybody needed so many of them.  I played blue, green and red, and my tactic basically was use blue to destroy my opponents tactics, green to get massive amounts of mana (plus Birds of paradise since I was 3 colored, but with all the double lands you could easily play 3 colors without much trouble to have the right mana, plus I had some artifacts that could change the color of mana) and a little support and red had strong creatures, fireballs ball ligthnings, chain lightnings, earthquakes and what have you in direct damage dealers. To protect myself I had several Ali from Cairos and mirror Universes (Ali keeps your life at least at 1 point, no matter how much damage you get, and the mirror universe changes life with your opponent, plus I had some was to make him fly).  There was this green card that let you sacrifice life for mana, and my deck produced TONS of mana. There was even a 4 card combination, if I had that on my hand, the game ended before my opponent even had a turn. I believe it was this sacrifice card, a fireball, a black lotus and a mox. Or did I even need the mox ? I don't remember exactly how much that sacrifice card cost, the idea was sacrifice 19 life with tat card, pump it all into a fireball, and get that one more mana somewhere. Either your land card was already enough, or you needed a mox on top, i am not sure.  Idea of the deck was wreak havoc with red damage dealers like fireball and ball lightning, plus there was the Shivan Dragon (5/5 flying for 2 red and 4 colorless, and every red mana you pumped into it gave it +1/0 for one round) and the killer bees (0/1 flying, each green mana gave it +1/+1 till the end of turn, had some crazy combos with that one, where I first sacrificed nearly all my life for mana with Channel, I had some way to make that mana green i do not recall, pumped in all other green mana I could get my hands on, let it attack, then sacrificed it through the Diamond Valley, which gives me 1 life for each point of toughness the creature has, so I get all my life back and then some )plus that green enchantment with which it got trample was always on my bees or the shiva dragon. Then there was giant growth, i had Vesuvian Doublegangers, that either  copied the dragon, or destroyed the opponents creature tactics by copying them. Then blue of course had counterspells. I had a few extremely powerful combos in it.  Of course I did not have all the cards in it all the time,. but varied around so my opponent never knew exactly what this round was in and what not^  I also loved to include a few of the original golden ones from Legends (the first set that even had golden Creatures) I later played again a bit around the time ice age came out. I remember how pissed a friend of mine, who had started with me but never stopped, was when Ice Age came out. He had FOUR icy manipulators (Tap or untap any card for 1 mana I believe) and suddenly it came out again in ice age. I think their price fell like 80%. That is just uncool, if a card was in a limited set, it should not come out again  in a later set, PERIOD !!! They shortly before even had a whole collection with cool card from Legends, Antiqueties, Arabian nights and the Dark come out in Germany (I don't know if they came out in english too, the prices ALL fell at least 40% of those that came out again in that edition, like the killer bees. You are just fucking over the collectors that way !!!!! NOT COOL AT ALL !!!!"

Really pretty game that is hella fun and on the cheaper side. i like it a lot more than YGO at the moment, especially since the meta is so stale for YGO :/ too boringggg)"
neckbeardstories,3de37w,LittleMissLokii,4,Wed Jul 15 19:41:34 2015 UTC,"I have a theory about this in general, but in this particular instance, I can't help you. Magic (and other CCGs, but I'd say it's particularly true of Magic) is a game where you can do ok just by throwing money at it. Neckbeards just LOVE to be good at something (because they're bad at plenty) and they don't like to put effort in to get good at things. Ever see a neckbeard play an instrument, get into good shape, get a Ph.D (despite how they love teh ""science"")? Didn't think so. With a CCG, you can look at decks online that are good and just run those. A lot of the time you don't even need to know WHY certain things are good, just that they are.  There are plenty of noobie players out there or people who are trying something new or people who don't want to spend $10 on one card, so if they just play their $500 deck all the time against all these players who are so clearly not playing the game the same way, of course they'll win. In my (admittedly little) experience, Neckbeards shy away from drafts because they're not as good at thinking on the fly. Hell, even if you look at Pro Tour players there's a distinct lack of the over the top neckbeardy types. That's because they don't really ""get"" the game, they just want to play something on easy mode with cheat codes on."

The members of the course (Including Morgan) and the course tutor all met with the Trashman, who brought his family, girlfriend and a friend along as defense. It was revealed he essentially started spending the money a week after he got it, and everyone he brought tried to defend him. Currently he is writing a confession to stealing the money. Once they have this confession the plan is he either gets the money back by september (job,loans etc) or he's to be taken to court. If he doesn't write the confession or co-operate, somebody on the course knows a solicitor, and will have them send baliffs around, who if they can't take the full value of the money, will end up making the Trashman declare bankruptcy. If he is taken to court, from what I can gather this isn't a jailable offence, but will of course show up on a criminal record and he may be fined even more money off of it possibly. Overall Morgan is pretty happy with it, and I think this is pretty much justice, since if he does pay the money back, the situation is somewhat fixed, if he can't then he's pretty screwed."

A lot of highschoolers, even the ones who take AP classes never get a proper European or African or South American or Asian (or Mexican or Canadian History).   For example, I had american history 3/4 years in highschool.  My teacher for ap european history was fully incompetent. She told straight out lies about europe, and also probably didn't know what the war of the roses was. Seriously, several history nerd friends of mine told me that they learned more from Crusader Kings than from class. No one in our class got above a 3 on the exam.  History education in the US is absolutely abysmal, and I'm surprised that even two people in his class knew about the war of the roses. If you want a proper history education as an American, you either have to do it in college or self-study.   If anything, some students get an okay European history education in some states in some schools, but very, very few learn anything about countries not in Europe or the US."

There were some less obvious things that were a result of incompetence. She would just get people's names wrong, dates wrong, even locations wrong.   There were also some really weird things, like making a big deal about chastity in the middle ages, and how about so many of them would wear chastity belts. It was weird.

To be fair, while the War of the Roses was a big deal in the history of the monarchy, its repercussions didn't really affect the common people. The nobility liked to play it up like it was a huge civil war ravaging the land, when it was really just two families fighting for power.

I was fortunate in having some very good history teachers, but you can only devote so much time to something as complicated as the War of the Roses. In college, I took an intensive course on Cold War history, and we barely had time to go through why the USSR collapsed and still be able to get into the Chinese Revolution."

neckbeardstories,3cd6ag,SoldMyHouseForRP,2,Tue Jul 7 16:21:24 2015 UTC,I think Neitzche's brand of irrationalism is juuuuust accessible enough to them (with enough watered-down translations of his work on the internet) to satisfy their need to be ~the most intellectual~ and ~so superior to the plebs~
neckbeardstories,3cd6ag,meduka_no,2,Thu Jul 9 21:15:50 2015 UTC,"The core of Nietzche is rejecting moral lessons that are handed down from above or laws that you have to follow because that's what everyone else does, and instead forging a personal moral code that makes sense to you. Neckbeards love it because it fuels their hero delusion, where they are the only truly alive human being and everyone else is either a bystander to adore them or an obstacle to effortlessly tear down.

I'm starting to realize that I might've had an experience/online relationship with a neckbeard  (he didn't have a neckbeard in HS, but we were friends and 10 years later when I reconnected with him on FB, he told me he had a huge crush on me. there's so much more to the whole story to put in this sidenote.) that I knew in high school.

Roman leaves and it is just me, Nu-Neck and his creepy side kick. Out of completely nowhere at all, Nu-Neck starts spitting out pervy ideas, and I mean NSFW ideas, to me. I won't get into full detail because it was really NSFW but lets just say for now I was scared to be alone with him. So I started to inch away from him during the conversation, and his stupid creepy side kick was all like ""Dude, Snails, what is wrong with you? I thought you wanted a boyfriend!"" While Creepy Side Kick was defending Nu-Neck, Nu-Neck was constantly saying ""No no no, she is a feminist she loves girls!"""

When you communicate to a dog in its own language that you are the pack leader, it is relaxed and carefree, not having to worry about looking after the pack. I am not at all saying that I disapprove of your pet or how you treat it. I just like to spread knowledge so that people can have healthier and happier dogs. A dog that doesn't think it is the pack leader is more relaxed and stress-free, and who wouldn't want that?"

neckbeardstories,3bv52t,FinnSven,3,Thu Jul 2 20:49:33 2015 UTC,"They are very friendly, yes. Sometimes they have a little too much love to give and knock people over when they try to say hello, but they're friendly :)"

neckbeardstories,3bv52t,Ze12thDoctor,6,Thu Jul 2 16:46:58 2015 UTC,"I get where these people are coming from, it's a misplaced sense of compassion and empathy that really feels for animals but doesn't really synthesize just how different the consciousness of a human and a dog really is. For example, you can't lawfully or ethically leash a person without their permission, even for their own safety because human adults are capable of taking responsibility for themselves. Animals, like babies, cannot. It's no more unethical than strapping a baby into a safety harass without the baby's permission than it is to leash a dog without its permission, the being in question is legitimately not responsible enough to take care of itself on its own and its life would be compromised if you didn't take these actions. These people understand the theories of ethics and morality better than they do the realities of ethics and morality and that's why you see strange conclusions like this being reached.  In short: leashes do not ethically violate an animal's rights because animals are shitty decision makers and their lives would be put in serious jeopardy if the leash wasn't there to prevent them from making decisions."
neckbeardstories,3bv52t,MissWiggly2,6,Fri Jul 3 01:00:03 2015 UTC,I used to work at a pet store and we had a guy like this who insisted that he could bring his dog in without a leash because of how well trained it was. It got in a fight with another customer's dog (which was on leash) and he ended up cussing out our manager because it was somehow our fault. He ended up saying that we were discriminating against him because he was Asian and stormed out

neckbeardstories,3bguri,2meterrichard,27,Mon Jun 29 04:47:33 2015 UTC,I think your asexuality gives you an advantage of looking at the person inside and not judging them based on whether or not you'd bang them.   That aside I'm looking forward to the rest of the story.

neckbeardstories,3bguri,OmniscientSpork,7,Mon Jun 29 18:45:14 2015 UTC,It's mostly just uncommon because of the lack of visibility of asexual people. You would think it'd be neutral and unoffensive but people take it very personally and assume that it must be SOMETHING offensive.

I just want to know what normal person would get offended or angry about Asexuality. I mean, abstinence is even supported in so many religions, so there wouldn't be a religious reason for a normal person to be against it. People are generally fond of population control, so there wont be many people saying ""I hate you because you aren't making lots of babies!"" I mean, who would get offended by it beyond getting rejected at a bar because of it? That's what I really want to know. I mean, beyond that, jealousy ""Here I am with three kids and relationship problems and she wont have any of this!? I'm offended because I'm jealous!!!"", and neuroticism, I'm not sure where the hate would stem from."
neckbeardstories,3bguri,Captain_Krumen,8,Mon Jun 29 21:21:43 2015 UTC,"There is lots of jealously but honestly it's not that bad because most people are generally polite about being jealous. ""I'm so jealous of you, you must never have relationship problems, lol"" when it isn't untrue, although it would probably be had I not realized sooner that it's okay to not date.  And that's the thing- Being single is a bad thing to most people. So generally people's reaction is, ""Oh, you're just making that up because you can't get a date."" which is rant-justifying frustrating for many reasons but the biggest one is is that it sounds like negging.

I don't mind people I've told discussing it to eachother, but broadcasting me to random people is a bit rude!"

As a consequence of that guys will treat you lesser to other women(but equal to other men) it's a sad fact but most guys have no interest in women in a non-sexual/platonic manner.  3.Being an obese neckbeard, having a girl walk up to him, tell him she likes him...but then follow up by saying they are asexual will seem like a prank/punch in the gut, as i've said before most guys do not care for a girls platonic affection, it's worthless to them.  Also likely he won't be able to help but assume the follow up asexual statement has something to do with his appearance, he's wrong in this case but probably gets it a lot.  My two cents on the issue, it may not be nice to hear but it's the truth."

Pagan gods are present in the real world and control natural powers at their whim, which means any natural process is the result of whatever dumb idea an infantile (literally, that's how they're described in their respective mythologies) deity might come up with. This again means there is no possibility of finding reliable laws describing the behavior of a natural system, which means no science.

I've found that no matter the religion, they find some way to make it all about them and m'lady, wheather going the batshit insane route and claiming to have had a (insert deity here) related vision where the two of them were meant to be together, or going the entirely misogynistic route and basically inserting his fantasies wrongly into the religious beliefs, and attempting to force them (and sometimes himself) upon the m'lady of his choice.  They have a way of thinking that is self centered and 3edgy5every1, and will use the belief system as something to confirm to themselves that they are in fact the protagonist and are therefore entitled to all the things the protagonist has - the money, the badassdom, the girl(s), and the right to always be right, more right than anyone else has ever been. This will probably not change them. It may even make things worse"
neckbeardstories,3bavld,SkepticSloth,3,Sun Jun 28 06:03:56 2015 UTC,"Atheism and neckbeards is less about belief, than it is abusing it to smack people around verbally with. That's why a lot of them run around looking for a fight over religion, they're setting up a situation where they think they have the upper hand, and they can peacock-like strut around and display their superiority.   Neckbeards to me are a special subset of narcissism. Everything is a means to an end with a narcissist, and so it is with neckbeards."

neckbeardstories,3b7nro,stevo_stevo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:17:20 2015 UTC,"The merciless sun radiates its glaring beams through my blinds to suggest the time has come for me to wake from my restful slumber. I usually don’t kowtow to orders from anyone but my own, but even I understand there is a time to practice restraint and flow with the mundane routine of the mediocre peasantry, especially with the fiery beast giving me all he has. My mornings typically commence at my own convenience whenever my senses are fully recharged from an evening of revelry; however, I had an early night’s repose due to my World of Warcraft’s guild’s prior engagements. Fools! I could raid all night running on only two Four Cheese Hot Pockets and a single six-pack of 12 oz. cans of the magical elixir. Yet, my commitment is not the one to be ruled upon, and their judgment will be stern and harsh when their post follies leave them helpless in future supernatural combat. I sashay my hips from side to side until I am able to use my nemesis gravity’s forces to my advantage and swing my legs over my bed in order to sit upright. My groggy eyes can barely adjust to functioning to the vehement conditions of rising at this unearthly hour reserved for simpletons and brutes.   My robust hands brace myself against the mattress to fight gravity once again, until a familiar feel of cool plastic embraces my digits. I can’t help but let out a sigh of relief as I lift the 24 fl. oz. bottle of Mountain Dew into my gaze. The light glistens through my muse to illuminate my gloomy dwelling with lime-green gleams as if I tapped my heels three times to be transported to the mesmerizing Emerald City where anything is possible. A place only made more beautiful by the orange hue engulfing the top of every single skyscraper from the beams of light cascading off each Doritos crumb on my bed. If only a place as magical as this existed, but for now I can only suffice with the few seconds of joy I can get from the soothing taste of the Dew.  As soon as I find the one silver lining in this wretched morning, it all comes tumbling down quicker than my attempts at treadmill power walking. My subterranean abode is infiltrated with the vile noise of cheap Target-bought high heels clanging against the kitchen tiles. This can only mean one thing: mother is awake. She means well by letting me stay comfortable in my temporary setting of the basement, but her questionable actions always are counterintuitive of her so called feelings. The daily reminded of getting a job has now become accompanied by sly maneuvers such as a Newspaper being opened to the wanted ads or a barrage of text messages asking me what I am doing today.  Silence, for a mere lackey to the churning behemoth we call society can not quite grasp the intellectual quibbles and emotional dilemmas I must daily before I can even consider tackling the issues of the lesser species of humans. Anyone with a dial-up modem could research Maslow’s hierarchy and dare to fathom the struggles of self-actualization people of the higher echelon of society, as I need to deal with. So I will humor her petty attempts of trying to immerse me into this servitude that is beneath me, only to keep the balance of powers at be in the domicile. I admire her commitment and courage to keep being abused by the hands that feed her, and one day I hope she understand the reality and I hope I can save her.  Once I finally her the rickety garage door close, I know the coast is clear and I being my morning rituals. My large majestic clodhoppers push the debris of mangled Hot Pocket boxes and ravaged Doritos’ bags out my way to trek to my dresser. I don my gray compression shorts to sculpt around my Renaissance figure and minimize the amount of chafing I will endure from walking. Feeling a little risqué from the morning Mountain Dew, I decide to spice things up and rock some vintage khaki shorts with cargo pockets for all my necessities. A dapper black bowling shirt with white bold stripes running down each breast will do just fine to mesh with my sleek, brown Velcro sandals. I almost slap myself silly by committing a huge fashion blunder. I rummage through the abyss of my dresser drawer to pull out two cotton tube socks that will keep my shins warm throughout the day.   I must say I will be a rather dashing man on the scene today, but I can’t help but feel as if my ensemble is off a bit. As I run my sweaty fingers through the defined brillo pads growing out of my neck, it hits me! I open the grease stained Domino’s pizza box decomposing on my dresser to reveal my trusty fedora. It looks a little crimped, so I clench my meat hook into a fist and gently tap the inside of my topper to bring it back to life. A little tag sticking out of the hat has the initials F.A. scribbled in black marker, to make sure in a world filled with amazing hat wear copied by jealous impostors, I will always know this one belongs to me: Fred Aura. I place the beautiful creature on my cranium, slightly tipping the brim to cast a dark shadow over my pupils. It may not be how every man starts his day, but the gentleman always will look classy before he ventures out on his next quest."

neckbeardstories,3azyax,felinepiracy,22,Mon Jun 29 15:03:47 2015 UTC,There have been a lot of questions about this recently and I think the general consensus is that the tipping point for whether or not someone is a neckbeard is how they interact with others.  Read back through some of the previous conversations and I think you'll find that your friend's a socially adept nerd and not a neckbeard.

neckbeardstories,3azyax,Ashur-bani-apla,14,Wed Jun 24 21:46:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's even a step further than that. I'm an introvert and used to be a really shy nerd... I've opened up considerably since then, but I was definitely never a neckbeard. I think it's a certain obnoxiousness and social ineptitude and rather than introversion that makes a Nexkbeard. You can be shy and introverted without being obnoxious and, nigh on, sociopathic in some cases."
neckbeardstories,3azyax,Cevolian,5,Wed Jun 24 21:47:37 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree with you. I'm crazy introverted, and while I think I may have struggled some with feeling excluded in high school I've come to really accept and enjoy my introversion throughout my time in college. As a result I don't really have too many friends, and I don't socialize all too often, but that doesn't mean I'm incapable of doing it. I think that one of the biggest things that makes someone a neckbeard is social ineptitude to the point that is becomes insulting or uncomfortable for people around them. They're so socially unaware and wrapped up in their own world that they don't even recognize that what they're doing could be considered inappropriate to other people. I think that liking anime and video games, and also ironically the beard, are the least important factors in being a ""neckbeard.""

neckbeardstories,3azyax,ph34rwaffles,4,Thu Jun 25 00:38:43 2015 UTC,"Ok, it's true that the interests alone don't make someone a neckbeard, but there is a disproportionate level of people like this interested in such pursuits.   I frequently point out that football hooligans, another group I have dealt with frequently, while in some ways have similarities to neckbeards in their attitude to women, their knowledge of past games played, goals scored, and snobbishness about their chosen interests, even in some cases their dubious personal hygiene and lack of gainful employment, they tend to also have a lot of friends, do cope well socially, do attract women and often go on to better lives.   I get the feeling it's the surrounding cultures which play a part. Playing Magic the gathering, video games,and trying to prove that you are the worlds smartest athiest, tend to create an environment which is socially alienating.  That and the case of as is often described in these stories of them having indulgent parents, they seem to create fantasy lives in their heads, which become their idea of reality. Ie; girl who they like is who they want them to be, a simpering princess waiting to get married. They don't like this world view being challenged, plus have never had to deal with serious consequences. If ignored and laughed off, they put it down to the other persons misunderstanding or stupidity.   Football hooligans know very well pissing people off leads to violence, so they actually tend to be a bit more respectful of others, even if it is just to avoid a kicking.   So my point is, neckbeards tend to be able to form in these interests and the surrounding subcultures, not so in others. Hence more actual neckbeards are found."
neckbeardstories,3azyax,PrimaDonne,3,Thu Jun 25 11:57:02 2015 UTC,"But I think those interests are ones that attract a Neckbeard and cement an already warped view rather than forming that warped view.

Neckbeardedness isn't a focus on interests so much as behavior. Nerdiness is generally interest based but being a neck beard all depends on social interaction. As long as you don't believe that you deserve a woman just for being nice to her and understand that relationships are based on an actual connection between two people who enjoy being with each other you're probably fine.   Also, being friends with a girl is fine, in case you're wondering."

Popularity means the plebes like it, so it has to be bad. This plus their superiority complex and persecution complex means they latch onto extreme beliefs and express them in a caustic, belligerent way. They are so isolated and petty, they can't imagine themselves having the same cognitive ability of a person who likes or believes something they don't.  They look for a fight with people. They need to go on the offensive and establish control because they don't have any.

Don't attract them into your social circles - and that means looking at yourself critically and making changes to become the kind of person you want to be, not what's acceptable to a crowd of social misfits. ""Neckbeards"" are incapable of that, they can't see past their narcissistic self-image of ""perfection"". They never see the need to change, they insist that it's those around them that have to change to accommodate them - like you're doing with your music and entertainment choices.   But, if I've learned anything over the years, is friends come and go. If you end up in your later years with a handful of really good, close friends, you win. I look at the people I hung out with in high school, and I have nothing in common with them anymore, and have had no interest in reconnecting with them.  Friends are friends now, but you may want to open up your social circles to include people more like you, who benefit you as much as you benefit them from your friendship, and aren't as much of a burden.

I've been a professional programmer for quite some time, so let me share some of my experience with people who talk and act 100% like you. Going into CS from the business side does not mean you will be our boss -- at best you will be a producer, at worst you will be someone who can neither program nor conduct business at a professional level, and will never be employed to do either one. Seriously, think about it: if I need to hire someone to do some programming, do I hire someone who was only half trained in computer science? Or do I hire an actual computer scientist?  If I need someone to run a business and be the boss of programmers, do I hire someone that is only half of each? In my experience, I've always had a boss that runs business, and another boss that runs programmers. Business programmers are a joke; the most interaction we have with them is one of them will accidentally make something good, it'll balloon out of their control, and they'll need to hire actual programmers to fix their shitty spaghetti code. And we will -- laughing at their awful code the whole time.   In my experience, business programmers end up just being mediocre programmers who know nothing about real world programing, and spent 4 years too many writing calculator and calander apps in javascript."

Whatever the definition of neckbeard is, a lack of self awareness, especially a lack of self awareness of negative traits, is universally agreed as being a common factor.   You just sound a bit arrogant, self assured and obnoxious.  Something that I am also guilty of. Its annoying when fedora wearing MLP fans suggest I might be a neckbeard.

I propose you lure them out with what we in the business call the neckbead bait - This can take the many forms, primarily however they need to hear a neckbait talk or move about in the shop, normally they can smell/sense these out however we want to be certain to draw them out. A neckbait is usually a small, fragile, young M'lady who may dabble to any degree in Anime, Vidya or Science.   Alternatively, playing anime/leaving out M'dew and Doritos etc all constitute as valid Neckbaits.  Once lured out, the main test to determine if they are neckbeards, is to conversate with them, key indicators of neckbeardism are:   Anti-theism/Religion bashing Misogynistic views Intense breathing at the mention of waifu's General lack of manners The generic need to be right Disgusting invasion of personal space Unrelenting pursuit of M'lady Nice guyTM mentality   Once you have checked off at least 3 of these criteria, we can safely assume these specimen are Neckbeardus Sapien.

neckbeardstories,3aw256,mladybot,2,Wed Jun 24 09:13:01 2015 UTC,"I'd add a few things to the list:  Narcissistic mentality - the world revolves around them, and they have no ability to be self conscious.   Having to have the last word. You encounter this frequently here and in other chat mediums.   Poor anger management - they get offended easily, especially if it's someone they consider inferior to themselves.   Insufferable know-it-alls with obsession for trivia/useless data. Every time they open their mouth, odds are it will start with ""Well, actually..."" They know every minutia of the subjects they're obsessed with, and will make up what they don't know.   They are an authority at everything they try - art, sports, writing, gaming, no matter what.  They have no ethical compass, so will lie/cheat/steal to benefit themselves.  No regard for the impact of their behavior on others.   Delusional and elaborate internal fantasies. Their mental picture of themselves is so distorted, they are incapable of understanding how women don't swoon in their presence. That's because they're not women to them, they're walking, talking manga with boobs who are just pawns in their sad little world.   Little motivation for things with real reward, all time is spent on playing games and pretending to be ninjas, instead of applying themselves to something. Arrested development is just the beginning.   Expect reward and gratification if not outright applause just for being. They are rockstars in their minds, and can't compute why other's don't see it, give up, and just give them everything now. There are people like this who aren't cowards, they go on to be actual rockstars and celebrities. (Hollywood is a viper's nest of narcissists)  Instant gratification rules their lives.   Intimacy is their Kryptonite.   Sharing is unheard of. And they get theirs first.  As is hygiene. Shower? It shouldn't matter how I smell, to other people.   They will rationalize, excuse, pervert, distort, mutate, and shuffle anything to avoid responsibility.   They are cowards.   I've known a few neckbeards over the years, even a female one. They all display the above characteristics. It's just these days they've chosen a ""uniform"" of sorts, the cargo shorts, the game t-shirts, the fedoras, and the other end of the spectrum, the elaborate suits, capes, top hats, etc.   I think in previous generations we just called them anal retentive assholes."

neckbeardstories,3aohfc,Origami84,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:48:49 2015 UTC,"What I said still applies.   You know, the exact same ones that people in college study.   Textbooks are good for learning what's already known. You need guidance to learn how to come up with novel ideas in a technical field.   Also, to do research in scientific fields, you generally need equipment.   Only without a professor to check if you studied them well   A professor's job really isn't to check whether you studied the material well. A good professor is more like a guide than a grader. Someone to guide you along at a reasonable pace through the material, and to help you with the tricky parts.  Look, I'm not saying that it's impossible to learn all of undergraduate physics just by reading textbooks, but people are acting like that's all college is.  College provides access to the greatest minds in the fields you want to study. It provides someone to help you with whatever you want to study. It allows you to know when your understanding of material is complete or incomplete.  Secondly, it's also very, very hard to learn some subjects without having someone lecture a little bit and answer questions for you. Honestly, as a maths student, lecture tends to be 5 or 6 times more useful than reading the book. Things are just easier to grasp when someone is explaining them to you.  Also, college provides an incredible amount of academic and professional opportunities. Like I was saying before, the option to easily get into a research position or an internship or high-quality job can't be underestimated. And colleges aggregate all those opportunities.   and a multi-thousand $$$ bill.   While that's true, if you know what you're doing, you'll easily make the difference up."

neckbeardstories,3aljxc,Arrav_VII,129,Sun Jun 21 11:55:26 2015 UTC,"I always took it to be that everyone sees themselves as a nice person, in our minds we are all the protagonists of our own story.  Enter neckbeard: Views himself as a protagonist, usually socially stunted, which leads to not being familiar with dating standards. Also has been conditioned his whole life to believe that women respond to romantic gestures, persistance always pays off, and, that the protagonist always gets the girl.   However, due to fairly unattractive traits common to neckbeards/nice guys (lack of boundaries, not reading/understanding social signals/generally poor hygiene etc etc) there is little romantic interest from the opposite sex.   When they see girlsthat they are interested in being interested in another guy they view him as the antagonist in their personal story, the girl is meant to be his, so why is this guy taking her from me?  Pretty much everyone who stands in his way of getting a girl becomes an asshole/bad guy. For the simple reason that he thinks he deserves a girl to love him."
neckbeardstories,3aljxc,icefarts,48,Sun Jun 21 12:36:05 2015 UTC,"I'll add another wrinkle to that: neckbeards were usually bullied by the other boys growing up, so they instinctively think of any guy who isn't an otaku as a bully and a jerk."
neckbeardstories,3aljxc,TakeOffYourMask,21,Sun Jun 21 16:57:36 2015 UTC,otaku   Had to Google that. Never knew that the Japanese had a word for neckbeard.
neckbeardstories,3aljxc,1iota_,20,Sun Jun 21 17:28:16 2015 UTC,"And the word has two different meanings in Japan and the rest of the world, well three really. In Japan the word has a negative connotation, that the person is strange and obsessive and inappropriate about his hobby. Anime fans, particularly younger ones, only saw that 'otaku' were fans of anime and adopted the label innocently. Weeaboos calling themselves that have given it a negative connotation everywhere else. There are still anime fans who aren't neckbeards or necessarily weeaboos who call themselves that however. --signed, someone who used to call themselves that before they knew better."
neckbeardstories,3aljxc,imminent_riot,3,Sun Jun 21 18:24:16 2015 UTC,"I love when western otakus finally learn that anime fans are just as outcast in Japan as everywhere else. I had a friend(well not really a friend just a person I saw at school), total weeb, who whenever I called her weeaboo she would say, ""I'm not a weeb I'm an otaku."" To which I would respond, ""In Japan they're the same thing..."" She finally learned this the hard way when a Japanese foreign student began avoiding her at all costs."

Especially if they end up being made to look very stupid by said ""arsehole""."
neckbeardstories,3aljxc,FinnSven,29,Mon Jun 22 15:45:31 2015 UTC,"And in a lot of movies/TV shows, the hero goes through some journey and gets the girl as his prize. A lot of times, the guy starts out as a nerd that she's not interested in. Some guys don't realize real life doesn't work that way, and get angry when they don't ""get the girl"" in the end.    Also, in these movies, there's typically some love interest jock who treats her horribly, and she slowly falls in love with the protagonist instead. I think the Toby McGuire Spider Man movie is a great example of this type of movie. So is Wedding Crashers. These themes are everywhere though!"
neckbeardstories,3aljxc,Tri_Sara_Tops,22,Sun Jun 21 17:57:51 2015 UTC,"I think this point is actually a huge part of a neckbeard's mentality. They don't interact with other people and so get all of their ""social"" knowledge from movies, games, and TV shows. In those mediums you never see a guy simply go up to a woman, declare his intentions, and then go out with the woman as happens in real life. There's always a long, drawn out chase where the guy subtly makes his intentions known until at some point in the future the two characters get together by some miracle. Neckbeards think this is how relationships actually work; they believe that the woman is ""won"" through a lengthy chase, and that going up to women and declaring their intentions before asking them out is what ""assholes"" do."

In a lot of relationships, people feel comfortable making fun of each other in a joking way as long as it's nothing too touchy and you know where the limits are. So maybe I'll make fun of, say, the way my girlfriend mispronounces a word or something. Neckbeards take that to mean that I am a jerk, and they could treat my girlfriend better than me by being a passive doormat (who is, of course, rewarded with sex). It's easy to think yourself the hero when you see <1% of a relationship and misinterpret that small percentage."
neckbeardstories,3aljxc,whatsinthesocks,10,Mon Jun 22 15:31:43 2015 UTC,Also don't forget they believe their nice guys but really aren't.

neckbeardstories,3aljxc,LumoBlaze,3,Mon Jun 22 15:48:37 2015 UTC,"Late to the thread but as a former neckbeardium shaviosa, back in high school, a lot of us were ignorant to a lot of social concepts. I mean a lot. When I left for college, I learned enough social skills where my neckbeard shaved itself, the fedora burst into flames, and I entered society as a functional (albeit kinda fat) man.   It doesn't help that friends of a neckbeard, if not neckbeards themselves, almost always try to up the commonly low egos of the neckbeards. A lot of the fedoria tippin euphoria neckbeards omit like grease from a three week old hamburger, is bravado. Deep down it's common that they know just how unappealing, and socially unattractive they are. They hope the false bravado will make up for it, but it tends to make it worse  The only girlfriend I had in high school who was serious (as serious as high school can be) happened because I honestly opened up and acted like a human being. Which most unshaven scrotefaces can't manage to do to a human being with tits.   Source: am a reformed neckbeard"
neckbeardstories,3aljxc,thoumyvision,2,Thu Jun 25 04:31:56 2015 UTC,"However, due to fairly unattractive traits common to neckbeards/nice guys (lack of boundaries, not reading/understanding social signals/generally poor hygiene etc etc) there is little romantic interest from the opposite sex.    And on the other hand, they view the traits common to attractive men as being exclusive to assholes, probably because their interactions with guys who possess those traits, especially in high school, was not positive. A neckbeard interacting with someone who has confidence, competence, charisma and leadership is not going to come out looking well in any interaction with them. Sometimes they'll even take it as a badge of honor that they don't possess these traits."

neckbeardstories,3aljxc,canadianD,7,Mon Jun 22 05:14:29 2015 UTC,"that the protagonist always gets the girl.   I think this is a hard lesson for anyone to learn, though you're right neckbeards might take it more harsher. We might want to think that we're Jim and Pam, that it will eventually work it out because we're destined but sometimes they just don't. I'm well out of my neckbeard phase and kinda saw this first hand. Trick is to handle it maturely and like an adult."
neckbeardstories,3aljxc,PaganBacon,31,Mon Jun 22 00:48:21 2015 UTC,"I think it comes from high school culture, and in particular how high school is portrayed in media. Movies and whatnot are really bad at sticking with stereotypes of 'the kind, but unpopular nerd', 'the popular, but asshole jock' - and how the latter gets all the attention from the girls."
neckbeardstories,3aljxc,ThriKr33n,6,Sun Jun 21 12:39:10 2015 UTC,"And even in real life, they might only interact with the couple in public and over-exaggerate any conflict, thinking their relationship is rocky. But ignore the times when he's not hanging around the couple where they're probably in private and showing affection for each other.  So you end up with a skewed perspective."
neckbeardstories,3aljxc,ChubbyBirds,5,Sun Jun 21 16:44:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, or they're obviously flirting with the girl and/or insulting the guy, which causes the guy to respond in a way that shows his annoyance, thus furthering the idea that he's an ""asshole."" What the neckbeard doesn't get is that the boyfriend thinks the neckbeard is an asshole for acting inappropriately, and is responding in kind. But the neckbeard, who considers himself flawless, assumes that this is the boyfriend's normal personality and that he treats everyone, including the girl, like this. Neckbeards don't understand that their actions draw emotional responses from people, and that they're not perfect."
neckbeardstories,3aljxc,LilkaLyubov,13,Mon Jun 22 17:03:12 2015 UTC,"I think it also has to do with the fact that a lot of media around romantic heroes have the ""chivalrous knight"" trope. He waits for the girl to notice him, he does ""nice things"" to make her fall, and basically acts in a submissive way that usually dissuades romance from growing, hence the anger over ""friend zoning"".   Meanwhile, ""Assholes"" aren't always assholes here, but they don't follow the neckbeard script. They go up to women, declare their intent, and that's that. They're honest. Usually works better than that white knight crap. Neckbeards see this as asshole behavior, because it's not like the movies and books! But take romance out of it, it's really being assertive. We recommend that in most other areas for success, don't we?  It's funny because neckbeards, back when I wrangled them, bitch about women wanting a ""trashy romance novel"" hero because it's ""unrealistic"". Yet these guys take movies and books and the white knighting crap seriously. Most women who read that stuff KNOW it's escapism and nothing more."
neckbeardstories,3aljxc,sailorgaia,6,Sun Jun 21 17:09:15 2015 UTC,"I think you're spot on!  I thought that the ""girls prefer assholes"" trope came from the combination of the 1.) ""Girls going for the bad boys"" trope, the 2.) ""Confident male gets the girl"" & the 3.) ""I covet what others have but don't want to work for"" mentality.  I could easily see an awkward, shy man interpreting the confidence of a rival male as asshole-ish behavior because he's envious he doesn't have the experience, personality or even charm to approach females, let alone woo them successfully.  Heck, the entire M'lady joke comes from a neckbeard's inability to communicate with women in a normal way!  Given the fact that neckbeards are frequently lazy, lack humility, and believe they are the smartest people in the room, of course they would believe that only girls want ""assholes"" (i.e. men who aren't them).  It's the only way they can save their pride."

It's easier to blame the entire population of women for making what they think is poor decisions in dating.  Add that to the misogynistic viewpoint many neckbeards have, and its a petri dish of denial and blame throwing.  As an example: A neckbeard type I worked with once had a thing for another coworker.  He obsessed over her relationship.  Overall, it was a fantastic relationship, but she'd occasionally vent about something that happened.  He harped on every negative comment she make, it fuel to the fire of what an ignorant, stupid jerk the boyfriend was.  Any positive thing: they went on vacation, they had a good weekend, etc was just more validation for his viewpoint.  After all, because he thought he would be a superior boyfriend, so he deserved these rewards more than the actual boyfriend.  When neckbeard actually started dating though, every thing that went wrong he either voiced as his girlfriend's fault, or something that passively happened (even when he was obviously at fault).  He did a few grandiose gestures, showing up with flowers and chocolates, but couldn't deal with the day to day stuff of dating at all.  I don't think he really knew her in the slightest, just put this ideal on a pedestal and was upset when she turned out to be human.  When they broke up, she was a bitch who he ripped apart, sour grapes style.  He still obsessed over her though, and when she started dating again every guy she went with was a jerk."

neckbeardstories,3aljxc,DarthSinistar,19,Mon Jun 22 21:44:38 2015 UTC,"I think it comes, at least in part, from the spiel that a lot of girls will use when they want to let a guy down easily. It's much easier to say 'You seem really nice, but I'm not interested.' than 'Get the fuck away from me, you creep.' Especially when the person is as awkward and fragile as your average neckbeard tends to be. Meanwhile, the neckbeard just hears 'you're nice' and thinks that the object of his affections is disinterested solely because he's 'nice.'  So if she doesn't like him because he's nice, she must like the other people she's dated because they are assholes and she's just a woman who's too stupid to know what she wants."
neckbeardstories,3aljxc,TakeOffYourMask,7,Sun Jun 21 13:47:48 2015 UTC,"It comes from observing high school girls, and later, from observing women who haven't matured past high school, and extrapolating that behavior to all women."
neckbeardstories,3aljxc,PrimaDonne,5,Sun Jun 21 16:55:00 2015 UTC,"I always assumed it was black and white thinking. They get told their nice, maybe they hold doors open or donate to charity or something, so in their mind they're pure.  As neckbeards, they probably feel excluded from other men which makes them view the other guys as The Worst.  But they don't realize that the other men are also capable of being nice, but generally tend to also offer other things. Sometimes they realize that guys also offer money, but they never seem to realize anything beyond that point, and then think it's a dichotomy of Monied and Nice.  Their whole worldview is based around the fact that they're Nice, so they place more value on Niceness than a normal person would, but then don't understand why everyone else doesn't do the same.  Opinion is backed by the fact that people who end up in bad situations generally tend to put themselves in situations where it's likely to happen again, ie obviously it's the wimmins fault they date assholes and not mine."

But neckbeards don't realize that people are different and the ways they show their niceness are different too.  For example, I'm an ""asshole"" who had never joined any kind of volunteer activities which help poor people. But I used my time to help my parents instead because I'm a selfish bastard who care more about my family and close friends.  Of course, there're still some BASIC standards that you need to follow. But sadly those exact standards are not followed by the neckbeards themselves, like: Don't be an asshole just because you get rejected by someone who doesn't have romantic feeling toward you."
neckbeardstories,3aljxc,Ghostspider1989,16,Mon Jun 22 09:30:14 2015 UTC,"It comes from guys who dont know how to talk to woman. Its not that girls fall for assholes, its that girls like to have fun, and ""assholes"" tend to be a lot of fun to hang with."

neckbeardstories,3aljxc,nugbot,4,Sun Jun 21 14:55:41 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, this comes from the fact that the ""friendzoned"" guy ends up talking to the girl he likes a lot, and the girl complains to him about her boyfriend. She doesn't tell him about everything she likes about her boyfriend, just what happens to be upsetting her at the moment. Thus, the guy only hears about the bad things, and assumes the boyfriend must be an asshole. This happens many times with many women, and then he wonders why girls only date assholes instead of someone like him who is nice, which he is probably also told by many of these women since he is willing to listen to them."
neckbeardstories,3aljxc,ludovician,3,Sun Jun 21 23:00:48 2015 UTC,"Women like men with confidence, more than anything else. Independence doesn't hurt either.  This means that a man who can walk away from small petty bullshit, maintains other options and is interested in improving his own life more than worrying about another's is way more attractive than a man who tolerates and forgives small petty bullshit, puts a woman on a pedestal and obsesses over rescuing a woman or improving her life for her.  Sometimes assholes also exhibit these traits, and sometimes men who exhibit these traits are considered assholes anyway; hence, nice guys lose, assholes win."

neckbeardstories,3aljxc,bunker_man,3,Sun Jun 21 22:26:13 2015 UTC,"Passive aggressive people see people who are assertive (an attractive quality) enough to be regularly aggressive as ""more of an asshole"" than themself. If they lack confidence and assertiveness, and handwave their own asshole tendencies, but readily zone in on those in the people they dislike, it leads them to think that since they aren't assertive enough to be regularly aggressive, that they must actually be good people in ways that that the people they dislike aren't.  That's really like 80% of what it is."
neckbeardstories,3aljxc,FinnSven,3,Mon Jun 22 03:53:04 2015 UTC,"Their intelligence, or personal perception of their own intelligence, may play a part too.   A lot of them think that they are more intelligent than basically everyone else apart from Steven Hawking and Richard Dawkins.   Therefore other people are just stupid and Assholes.  It probably does not help that they like to point this out to people they think have a lesser intelligence than they, so bullying and being outwitted and made to look stupid will start happening to them.   Its undoubtedly annoying, but tremendous fun to do it to them, I have to say!    This does differ from the nice guy attitude, as nice guys do manage to make friends with girls. Nice guys get the idea that girls are attracted to arseholes because often they hear about the bad behaviour from boyfriends.   Of course they think they will do better, but they never think to actually ask the girl out. Or only do once the girl has reached a point when they do view the nice guy as a good friend.   Neckbeards also seem to place women on pedestals. That is also why they react very badly when they find out that an object of their ""love"" likes things like casual sex, booze, drugs, Mainstream TV.   A lot of them really seem to think that women are sitting at home, brushing their hair. Waiting for a knight in a shining fedora to come and do all their thinking for them.   Arseholes just ask them to do things they like together. Not like Real Gentlemen who show women what they should like and how they should think.   In short, its just the arrogance. No one is as smart or as nice as them. In their minds."

neckbeardstories,3aljxc,arrythmian,3,Mon Jun 22 23:14:58 2015 UTC,"My experience is that the neckbeard and ""nice guy"" heavily, heavily overlap, so even a semi-cute and semi-socially adept proto-neckbeard will eventually fall into that trap fully because he's your typical ""nice guy"".  My experience with nice guys is that they have two main problems: A. there is a minority of girls that genuinely are actively predatory and manipulative, just like with that minority of guys. nice guys make a b-line for them all day, every day, and I'll be damned if I know why. B. they always go after girls that are so far out of their league that they might as well be living on Mars. they think they are entitled to any girl that they want, they always go for all-around 9s and 10s, when they themselves are all around 6s or so. my experience is that most of them won't even settle for a solid 8."

A another cousin left her spouse to be with a bad boy thug type and now has to turn tricks to support her kids and him.   And then we have me, guess if people around you consistently refer to you as an asshole there might be something to it but I do have some redeeming qualities"
neckbeardstories,3aljxc,FinnSven,2,Mon Jun 22 20:27:00 2015 UTC,"Some women do fall for the confidence and the danger of being with guys like that.   My daughter is with a smelly, literal human-chimpanzee hybrid, who never showers or changes his clothes.  I suspect he is abusing her mentally, but in any case she refuses to leave him, citing that they have been through so much together.  The only event she can come up with is her defending him because people picked on him for being smelly and wetting the bed after drinking to much.  It's frustrating when she equates that to me and my wife having had the worst year in our first year of marriage. Breast cancer and more."
neckbeardstories,3aljxc,OldPinkertonGoon,2,Tue Jun 23 05:01:43 2015 UTC,"Some girls do date assholes. Consider women who remain in abusive relationships. Usually, this is because the woman doesn't see a way out of the relationship. But I have seen circumstances where women who have their own job and their own place to stay will still continue to have a relationship with a abuser. (One of these abusers happened to be a neckbeard. The full story is coming soon!) The reasons why this happen are complex, but a neckbeard might come to the conclusion that these women want a ""real man"".  And neckbeards might be projecting. Most men will choose an attractive mean woman over an ugly nice woman when given the choice. Neckbeards assume that the assholes are getting girls because they are handsome."

They perceive themselves as being a nice, loveable guy. But the common neckbeard observes that they can't attract female attention (without trying), but guys who regularly work out, shower, groom themselves, and are fairly fashionable get women easily. And since they are fit, groom themselves better than the neckbeard, and have a better sense of proper public attire, the neckbeard sees them as the stereotype of the asshole muscleman that mistreats women.   Women don't go for me, a gentlemen who does not have the best looks + women ""swarm"" the ""douchebags"" = women only go for douchebags and never give me, the nice guy, a chance.

They feel so threatened by other men that they perceive conflict where none exists. When they see a guy going out with a girl they like, they can never admit that the guy was better for her because she liked him more. It's much easier to blame girls for only wanting ""assholes"" and much harder to examine yourself, think about what you did wrong, and improve yourself accordingly. Neckbeards don't have the self-respect or the maturity necessary to grow and improve as a person, so they construct a childish fantasy world where they can never be wrong, where they don't have to face unpleasant truths about themselves."

(I realize not all men actually believe this as they grow older, but unfortunately many do.)  Since they think they're being nice, but are actually being creepy, they get super butthurt when the object of their fancy (see: woman) doesn't appreciate their advances.

The term has also been applied to those with no ancestral connection to Ireland or who claim Irish identity or nationality. A plastic Paddy may know little of actual Irish culture, but nevertheless assert an Irish identity.   The term is pejoratively used to refer to people on the basis of their perceived lack of authenticity as Irish.

neckbeardstories,3a8d3h,TheHoundsOFLove,18,Fri Jun 26 22:56:06 2015 UTC,"My ex-husband was from the same mold. He was neckbeard down the line, ticking all the boxes, plus the addition of all his faux Irish pride. As far as I could make out in like 15 years, no one in his family was actually Irish. They all just vaguely referred to ""the family"" and ""when we came over.""  Hell, his maternal grandparents were Welsh and his family name is a Scottish clan name. There was 1 person they claimed relation to that was known locally for establishing the first local Irish Protestant congregation. However, the relation was vague, to put it lightly. It didn't stop them, and especially him from covering every available surface in fake Irish kitsch. It was a shitty amalgam of clovers, pastoral landscape paintings, and cheap, mall-store quality sword replicas.   The greatest moment was when he met my current other half (after I divorced him, long story) who is actually the descendant of Irish immigrants. 3 of 4 of his grandparents made the move, in fact. His family are all very staunch Irish Catholics, who are proud of their heritage but not overtly. He tried to engage my ex in a conversation about history and the catholic/Protestant schism, and it became apparently very quickly that the ex knew nothing beyond topical Rob Roy level bs. He very quickly schooled the ex on his ignorance and walked away muttering about ""lace curtain cunts.""  After I told the ex what that actually meant, he left with his clover severely wilted."

neckbeardstories,3a8d3h,tinteoj,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:04:42 2015 UTC,"People, certainly in the UK anyway, became aware of them in the 90s. Arnie used one in a couple of films. What people heard then is that a desert eagle was basically a more powerful .357 automatic pistol. Like a Dirty Harry revolver, but faster and better at decapitation.  Most people in the UK have very little experience of guns and especially handguns. So its a bit excusable there.   I have a friend who was in the Israeli army who found the idea of using a DE in a gunfight hilarious. She claims that throwing an Uzi deliberately jammed, so it behaves like a frag grenade, to be more effective and fun."

That being said there are a couple neckbeards that do frequent the feild. I haven't had much of an encounter with them though will probably post if I get a story even some paintball people who are not it's are kinda neckbeards at times.

Basically most neckbeards believe that they are the very best like no one ever was at whatever hobby or special interest strikes their fancy. They are the hero of their own story; predisposed to a guaranteed victory and other people are either villains to vanquish effortlessly or tag-alongs to cheer from the sidelines.

Besides, the more common social category is race, because it's actively visible, and matters more in America, at least.

neckbeardstories,3a2f2x,StubNuts,21,Tue Jun 16 20:39:16 2015 UTC,"When things like the 14 year old porn incident happen, it is your responsibility to report it to the police.  I can't believe you didn't, but I can understand not wanting to get involved in a complicated legal case.  However, you have to consider that if a man will show porn to one child, he most certainly will show it to another.  This sort of behavior isn't normally an isolated incident...pedophilia isn't something that someone just tries once for the hell of it.  It is a pattern of behavior that can become ever more forward and salacious.  Not all by far, but a lot of neckbeards I've met or heard about tend to gravitate to younger folks, females in particular.  I think this is the result of a delayed maturation, the outward expression of which is their interest in childish things (MLP being a prime example).  Unfortunately, they can use what maturity they have to attract younger people and take very questionable actions with the impressionable kids.  This behavior can lead to sexual and mental victimization of the kids if it is not stopped.  I never understand why parents let their kids hang out with ""the older guy"" when that older guy is 10+ years senior to their children and not exactly mentor material.  Its just asking for trouble.  It happens.  I was taken advantage of by an older neckbeard when I was 14 and it has screwed up my whole life.  I'm in my mid-30's now and I deal with this crazy emotional damage every day.  And it didn't stop there.  He lost interest in me when I outgrew him (around 18).  He kept me around, but went on to sexually assault my mother and molest my niece from ages 6-8.  Never, ever ignore the signs of a sexual predator.  Just like a tiger, they don't change their stripes and someone else may end up the victim of your lack action."

If the police come right then, and she's able to describe the image that is on his phone, that lends a lot of credence to the rest of her statement.  However, even if they can't prove it, they still have a record of the complaint, which makes the next complaint look even more suspicious (for him, not his potential victim).  Or his conversation with the police becomes a wake-up call and he gets professional help.  In all cases, calling the police can't hurt and probably helps."

There are some stories where the main antagonist does, indeed deserve it, but with the increased popularity and hilarity of these stories, so too do the ambiguous stories, the ones that aren't so clear, but just like the good people over at r/justiceporn, most of us want to believe the antagonist deserves ridicule, so we tell ourselves they do SOMETIMES.

neckbeardstories,392mxq,Harpy_Bird,3,Mon Jun 22 08:00:14 2015 UTC,"From what I've read they don't even seem awful, tbh.   A person's behavior is interpreted different depending on how they look.  Fat guy who's quiet?  Creepy. Fit guy who's quiet?  Mysterious!  Ugly girl who follows you around?  Creepy.  Hot girl who follows you around? How adorable!  Hot guy does something stupid?  Aww poor guy needs some help.  Neckbeard does something stupid?  He should just fucking kill himself.  How you look probably matters more than what you do.   Although we are admonished “don’t judge a book by its cover”, we repeatedly defy that warning as we go about our daily lives responding to people on the basis of their facial appearance. The impact of faces is shown in our impressions of people as well as in our behavior towards them, such as whom we help, whom we hire, or whom we ask for a date (Zebrowitz, 1997). Appearance matters not only when our reactions to a face are arguably relevant to our choices, but even when those choices should be driven by more objective information. For example, facial appearance predicts criminal justice decisions (Eberhardt, Davies, Purdie-Vaughns, & Johnson, 2006; Stewart, 1980; Zebrowitz & McDonald, 1991), as well as congressional elections (Todorov, Mandisodza, Goren, & Hall, 2005)."

Someone who leans more towards introversion than being a social butterfly.  2.) I'm talking about in general.  Yes there will always be exceptions but that doesn't mean we can't draw general rules about human behavior.  If we couldn't find general rules about human behavior then social science wouldn't function at all.

I was in college, living in a fine arts dorm and saw first hand how it changed the ""rules"" of human relations.  I could go on but others have already written about it. Read up on it.   There have been some significant changes how people relate with each other driven by technology. We have apps for people to peruse perspective dates like the ""Sex Teleporter"" in the movie ""Logan's Run"". When that movie was made the scene was shocking.  What I mean by the term ""rules"" is the mores that we are taught. When I was a young teenager it was considered ""against the rules"" for a girl to call a guy on the phone."" (I'm not that old!

Otherwise they're in for a rather rude awakening when they get into a course or try to apply to game studios.

neckbeardstories,38dtah,RogerMellie01,9,Wed Jun 3 18:36:30 2015 UTC,"As a software developer, I've never understood why video game development is such a dream job for people.   If you try and strike out on your own and make an indie game, great, but that's like opening a small business. How many of those fail in the first year? If you get a gig with an established company, it's not glamorous, it's basically just another coding gig. You're most likely not going to come up with ideas, you're going to start off writing code for modules that implement somebody else's ideas. You might get assigned to work on a game genre you're not even interested in.   Maybe it's because I've been in software development long enough to be jaded, but I couldn't get any more excited about writing code for a game than I currently do about writing business apps."

This was brought up when we were all teenagers doing the whole humble-bragging about how far we had gotten with girls. Each person escalated it in the normal manner - kissing, first base, handjobs, blowjobs, basically stuff that never happened with going WINK WINK NUDGE NUDGE. The lone girl in our group shared how she had full-on sex with a 16yo when she was 11. It was dawning on everyone that it was rape she was telling us about, and the mood was dying when Podrick stepped in with a shit-eating grin and goes ""Oh yeah? Well I had an anal three-way when I was 8!"" When asked about what that was, he did the whole ""What do you mean you don't know? Everyone does it"" routine.  Podrick was a piece of shit."

Especially on this sub, but I put that down to the reason a lot of these people encounter neckbeards is that similar kinds of people get drawn to the sci fi-fantasy, my little pony, card game world.  People who like these things are frequently insular and are rejected by peers to a certain degree.  Hence they can be a bit easily offended and a bit sensitive.  And then when I try to point out things like that, they call me a neckbeard!   I have never encountered a full on neckbeard in a group of football hooligans, for sure."

neckbeardstories,38db7i,Playcate25,5,Wed Jun 10 01:28:45 2015 UTC,"Basically, in 2011 IIRC, a new series of MLP came out, and a lot of people praised it for being well-animated, well-written, and for being relatively ahead of the curve for a children's TV show (a la Adventure Time, Gravity Falls, etc). Eventually, it became popular on sites like 4chan and became universally praised, bringing a lot of fans (bronies) in.   However, some Bronies were very obsessive of the new fandom. They obsessed over ponies, bought tons of MLP merch, and even made erotica featuring the ponies from the show (rule 34).  This bizarre pony-sexual behavior drove a lot of the ""normal"" bronies away, leaving behind creepy neckbeards.  Nowadays, considering MLP is not the fad it was was in 2011, Neckbeards have become the main members of the MLP cult following.  And that's why MLP is for neckbeards.  Source: My girlfriend is an ex-brony, she left the fandom in 2013 due to creepy neckbeards."

neckbeardstories,386jbl,AdvancingTECH,3,Wed Jun 3 15:30:32 2015 UTC,"I asked out a girl who was in a wheelchair once. She drank in a club I worked in for a bit. We had a bit of a flirtation over a few weeks, smiles, jokes, etc.   We danced and drank a bit on the night I asked her out, she seemed ok about it but a couple of her friends seemed unamused and they stopped going to the club. I got a different job not too long later.   I could be wrong but I got a feeling that her friends thought I was just leading her on. I wasn't, I did want to see her and see how it went. I don't think she was desperate or anything, she seemed happy and fun, nice smile and pretty. She not fully formed hands. So I assume that her feet might had been like that too.   Sure I am not angry at her friends or her, if my assumption is true, I get they were just looking out for her.   I never thought that she owed me a date because I liked her and she was in a wheelchair.  But I do get that there are people who do. And yes, it was something I did not want to mention because I did not want her to think I was hung up on it! Oh dialemmas!"
neckbeardstories,386jbl,Harpy_Bird,6,Tue Jun 2 12:27:40 2015 UTC,"I hear you dude. Although I once went on a couple of dates with a girl who had cerebral palsy. She was really nice and cute in her own way. It didn't really work out after that because we weren't that great of a match for other reasons. But when we went on those dates I could feel people around us staring and I know they were thinking, why is an ""able bodied guy"" is going out with ""a girl like that"". I'm just an average looking guy too."

Who's to tell me I can't date a girl because I'm ""normal"" and she's a ""cripple"", if they're a nice person, good at heart and I have an emotional attraction then I'll pursue it and see where things take us. Hell I even dated a larger girl once in my first year of university and got the stares too, probably people thinking I'm some sort of chubby chaser or something (truth be told if you look just physically she was ""ugly"" but looking past that she was sweet, kind, bubbly and happy. I'd go so far as to compare us to Melissa McCarthy and her husband).  I did lose contact with the girl with cerebral palsy but last I heard she's with a nice guy and I think some people were saying they make a great couple but they still get the stares a lot too."

He may be harmless now, but you never know how quickly these things can escalate. I'm sure you can take care of yourself, no question, but his behavior is inappropriate and chances are pretty good that, if he's treating you this way, he's doing the same thing to other girls, so you'd be helping them out as well.

Sorry, this really triggered the anger I have/had about jerks/creeps/assholes that think having a disability means you are desperate and willing to settle for ANYTHING. My advice is to snarl and tell him to FU, then turn him in if needed.  I have found that one does have to develop a ""technique""(?) to discourage creeps like this. I would not advocate what I finally did. (In the 80s I broke a guy's nose with a glöckenspeil in band class. He had called me a cripple one too many times and I snapped.) From that point most people began to leave me alone. In college I developed a very blunt manner. I almost died laughing when well meaning but clueless friends tried to match me up with disabled guys.  Don't let this creep get away with anything. Also, BTW, there are some really cool prosthetics out there. I once meet a guy whose wife had different ones for wearing heels, flats and running.     Used to do a bit of racing myself. Fastest I got up to was 135 mph. (That was a little over my comfort zone.) After that, I drove British cars. (Yes, silly me.)"

neckbeardstories,383peg,RedShirtBrowncoat,11,Wed Jun 3 07:03:33 2015 UTC,The thing about Sam is that he goes well over and beyond what's expected of him. He does literally all that he can to ensure his friend's survival.

neckbeardstories,383peg,wasniahC,3,Tue Jun 9 15:08:53 2015 UTC,"At least in the first book, Samwell is pretty clearly what the sort of person who George R. R. Martin envisioned as reading ASOIAF would be like in this world: an out of shape nerd who talks too much, chooses the weirdest vocabulary words to speak, and whose special snowflake hobbies cast him out of the rigid society of Westeros. He's basically a 'fuck you' to fat guys who dabble in fencing and think they could be knights if they went back in time.   His story arc does redeem him, but I think he does start out as a neckbeard, albeit an unusually effeminate one."
neckbeardstories,383peg,twovultures,11,Tue Jun 2 01:05:14 2015 UTC,Wow did you even read the first book? Like at all? Sam's backstory is extremely tragic. He is a survivor of severe abuse at the hands of his father and suffers from social phobia and anxiety to such a degree that he has regular panic attacks which his peers just explain away as cowardice.
neckbeardstories,383peg,DuapDuap,5,Wed Jun 3 14:08:53 2015 UTC,So...a reasonably sympathetic and accurate neckbeard portrayal?
neckbeardstories,383peg,jrshaul,8,Wed Jun 3 20:13:57 2015 UTC,"Well Sam isn't exactly a neckbeard though. He fights and strives to help his friends despite his problems, he is loyal and kind towards everyone and tries his darndest to be everything his father isn't. Even if he doesn't know it himself. There is nothing fake, immature or selfish about Sam. He is just an all around great guy, it's just that the GoT world revolves around toxic masculinity which leaves people like Sam who prefers books to battles, pens to swords and healing instead of hurting behind or outcast as ""not real men"". Sam doesn't want to fight but he does it anyway because he cares, a neckbeard would run or bitch and moan until his superiors killed him."

Obviously my interpretation isn't God's truth, but when I read the first book Samwell's initial behavior really did set the neckbeard alarm bells ringing."
neckbeardstories,383peg,twovultures,13,Thu Jun 4 02:29:41 2015 UTC,"Sam is pretty much the anti-warrior character. He's a fat kid who's smart and gentle, had been tortured by his martinet commander of a father, and then pushed into the Night's Watch because it was the easiest way to get rid of a disappointment son. But he's smart enough to be an advisor to Snow, and tough enough to take on a walker when tougher men ran screaming.   One of the best scenes with Sam was in the show, where he stands in the dark to protect Gilly and her baby. He know what's coming for them, but he's determined to stand and fight anyway. That's the kind of courage your Ren-fair fantasists and Nice Guys could never muster up."

neckbeardstories,383peg,DuapDuap,-5,Mon Jun 1 22:34:34 2015 UTC,"Because he lives in the fucking frozen north, is on limited rations, supposedly has to sword train and is still a fat fuck. I'm not talking about the show, in the books he never loses the weight. The only he is pulling that off is if he is stealing food and refusing to actually get off his ass and get better at fighting. He's been part of the watch for years now but still can't fight with a sword for shit. He's a nobles son who had plenty of training in it before coming to castle black. The half starved peasant kids pick it up pretty damn quick. I don't care how bad you are at it to start after several months practice you should at least be competent at wielding a blade. Spam Tarly routinely uses the I suck at it so I'm not going to try and get better at it line. It should be his words. An army of the undead is coming for them and he can't be bothered to get off his ass and learn how to not get his butt handed to him in a fight."

Yes, this probably went down in the worst way but Sleepy is equally guilty. Moonchild is not solely to blame. Yes, your friend went down into the path of neckbeardness but Moonchild is not the sole cause. Seems to me there is plenty of blame to go around.  But, then, High School is shit. 😕"

It was a good series, anything going all the way to 7 games is a good time.  Honestly, I'm going to take Chicago in the finals, though.  Beating the Mighty Ducks and then losing to the Lightning?  I can't see it.  I dread the endless crap that I'll get from the inexplicably high number of Chicagoite friends I have.  I do have a soft spot in my heart for the Hawks, though, because they picked up Marty Turco for a couple years when his time was up at the Stars, and Marty has always been my hero.  The Stars went from a team of veterans putting up the final fight to a bunch of kids greener than their jerseys in the last five years.  While we might have a lot of characters, we lack the leadership and experience to turn that talent into success on the ice.  My rule is that if we could compete over the same girl and it not be creepy, they are too young to lead a team.  We need another Modano.    Or the same Modano.    45 isn't too old to play, right?"

neckbeardstories,37gnrj,sailorgaia,10,Thu May 28 14:51:58 2015 UTC,"There is another family wedding coming up in a couple of weeks and the last thing I want is my girlfriend to feel uncomfortable around my family, but how could she not when she sees him there?   I suppose she could allow him to make her uncomfortable or she could just go and not let him intimidate her.  I think the only reason that he, in his delusional state of mind, thought he had a chance with her is because 1.) liquid courage & 2.) sheer laziness.  Regarding 2, you had done all the hard work in attracting a quality female.  So many neckbeards have such a twisted idea of what a woman wants in a man, he thinks all he has to do is present himself and they will flock to him.  Heck, he probably thinks you cockblocked him with your own girlfriend and that's why she didn't immediately dump you for him.  He's far too lazy to put in the sort of effort that it might take a person to leave their current partner for another. His level of effort seems to be ""all talk, no action.""     You guys can probably go and have a great time together and if he tries anything, she doesn't have to pretend to be nice to him. In fact, she's not even required to speak to him if she doesn't want to.  You can also arrange for her to never be alone, which shouldn't be hard at a family wedding!  If he's usually a pretty decent fellow, he's unlikely to try anything drastic or rapey.  If he tries to follow you when you go to leave again, you can always tell him you're both too tired to hang out.  Honestly, most of the neckbeards I've dealt with in real life are mostly harmless, in spite of the creep level being over 9000.  Running away and hiding from them is such a middle-school level reaction and gives them more power than they are worth.  You two shouldn't give up the opportunity to have free cake just because of a neckbeard!"
neckbeardstories,37gnrj,throwawaytc123,10,Wed May 27 17:43:11 2015 UTC,"Oh we will definitely have a great time! Again, neither of us thought his intentions were sexual, I had no idea I was actually fueling his expectations by allowing them to have a private conversation. You are very right on your two points, and in preparation for his gastric bypass I guess he can't drink at the next wedding, so I think it he will be less bold. The second point is so spot on too, he never gets a chance to interact with women, so when he saw her he just assumed ""well I'm a better option than my cousin, so why wouldn't she want me?"""

She definitely was not bored, and there was no risk of anyone stealing her from me? Like I said, I thought he was harmless and didn't see any reason to keep them apart.

On the other hand, there are also red pill subscribers who treat women like dirt because they think this will make them fall in love with their rankness.  Neckbeards exist on the two extremes, but their motives are the same in either case."

And then there's the normal person types, Beyonce fans, legbeards, Tumblrites, and social justice advocates fighting against bullshit going on in the Middle East, and other places where women have the shitty end of the stick.  At the end of the day, telling people you fall under a certain label doesn't mean anything, so if that's your only redeeming quality you might wanna consider going out into the wilderness and being a hermit."

This guy was a Nietzsche freak and when he found out I spoke German, and had read his favorite, stalked me for the weekend. I tried to politely rebuff him and his deplorable language attempts.

neckbeardstories,36n43s,Flirtatious_Vagabond,4,Fri May 22 01:54:50 2015 UTC,"I was fortunate. My father's family is German (Volga-Germans in western Kansas) so I grew up hearing the language spoken. So I had a bit of an advantage with the phonetics.   That being said, the best advice I can give is to take classes. If that is not possible then find a book with lessons. For me the hardest thing is grammar. It is different. If you have learned another language it will be easier. Get a good dictionary and learn vocabulary, and learn, and learn. The great thing about learning another language is that it also helps you better know your own!  Fortunately, we live in a connected world. Go online and listen to German TV and radio. Get German translations of your favorite books. (Ones that are familiar so you can concentrate on the language not figuring out the story.) Find a native speaker, perhaps one who wishes to brush up on conversational English. (It is taught there.) Also, learn how to be polite. I know this sounds odd, but a lot of languages have a separate formal case. Knowing when to use it is important.  Please understand that learning a language is not a process of instant gratification. It will take time and work. It will be frustrating at times but  you will get it eventually. With me, I knew it had clicked when I began to dream in the new language.  Hope this helps."

The smaller of the two brought a video camera with him to film the festivities. Every once in a while over the course of the week, someone would see him sitting in the grass, looking into the camera's viewer, and appeared to be watch the girls from behind. Each time someone would call him out he'd say the camera wasn't on, and that he was just looking at footage he had taken earlier that day. Finally, on the last day there while a few of the guys were away fishing, another dude got hold of the camera and plugged it into the TV. Sure enough he found TONS of footage of the girls' asses and cleavage without their knowledge, peppered with a soundtrack of ""It's not on!"". Creepy fuck..."

He had a miniature my little pony figure on his computer desk. He really enjoyed doritos. He never agreed to do something outside, only xbox or pc games in his house.   But I didn't give it too much thought to it, later I found out he had a girfriend, ok cool, I think.  He says they've been together for a while and that he really likes her, nice, I asked him about her but he doesn't really wanted to talk about her.  One day, out of the blue, he decides to tell me his girlfriend lives in another country and that is a long distance relationship, and sends me a facebook profile, I could only see a couple of pics since most of it was private, I added her but she never accepted me.  Later he sends me a message, sadly, his girlfriend broke up with him and he seems devastated, he says he loved her and it was making him miserable, so, ofcourse I try to cheer him up.  He invites me to sleep and play games at his house, sure! I say, and went there.  He gets quite comfortable with me there, and it was somewhat weird, by late night he tells me he likes me, I politely decline, he went crazy yelling how fucked up I was and how I'll never be with anyone. I left.  A couple of days after the incident turns out his girlfriend and he are together again, that's when I knew he was fucked up, did he broke with her in a chance to be with me?.  This guy is nuts, i didn't even know he was bisexual, and then it hit me, i googled her girlfriend facebook profile pic, it turns out they were pics from a foreign actress, when I confronted him he and his ""girlfriend"" blocked me on facebook and on every social media we were.

It does frequently come across like they believe firmly in the nuclear family unit and homosexual relationships may not be part of that.   At a totally unqualified guess, based on my understanding/misunderstanding of neckbeard thought, I would assume that they don't believe in lesbianism, as these would be m'ladies who have understood that most men are bastards who just want to hurt them, so are taking solace in their sisters arms waiting for a Gentle Sir to come along and fulfil their every need.   Gay men on the other hand are suitable if they are just being unthreatening shoulders to cry on for fragile m'ladies.  Or most Jocks are in fact closet gay men. That is why they treat women so terribly. They use women so that people don't think they are gay, but while they are having lots of sex with pretty girls, they are in fact thinking about being in the showers flicking each other with towels, after a game."
neckbeardstories,36n43s,khawarspirit,2,Thu Jun 4 15:46:45 2015 UTC,"That sounds like such a mess of a thought process. Yikes.   I've never come across a neckbeard myself, whether gay or straight. But even if they are gay, they probably wouldn't be comfortable showing it because of the company they surround themselves with. All the online video gaming is toxic, have you seen it? It's full of low-key or blatant homophobia, with words like 'fag' being tossed around without consideration.  It's natural to be affected by that kind of attitude, over a long period of time.

Especially online.   Back when I was around 20 (late 90s), it was the first time for a long time for homosexuals to be accepted and positive, (even in like 95, while it was ""OK to be Gay"" most people would be assumed to be disappointed to hear their kid was a wooly woofter.) Most gay men I knew then threw words like ""Poof"" and ""Shirt lifter"" around and laughed if called things like that by ""Breeders"". This was in Britain, and ""Fag"" would have been laughed at really hard, being viewed as a soft american word, only uttered by people to afraid to say ""gay"".   I suppose that is taken more seriously now, and the attitude has changed in different ways.   I live in Sweden at the moment, and have heard a lot of claims that today's Swedish teenagers are quite homophobic. The reason that I was given was that as they are expected to treat homosexuals equally and it certainly is the mainstream attitude here, they are backlashing and are making big issues out of it. I suppose the online gaming (really big here due to cold dark winters) might have an affect on this too."

Hate crimes aren't very frequent either. It's not talked about much but so far as i know, no one's been arrested for it. So with that taboo there aren't any witty insults or names or homosexuals.

I know young women (18-25 or so) who watch that and other cartoons, but I do consider them more than a little immature. They don't exactly go shouting about it, however, nor do they go on about how amazing it is because of its ""Message of Friendship"".   If you find it hard to understand that ""ordinary"" people, who view this rightly as a show primarily intended to shift a toy line for little girls, find adult men having some cult like worship of a cartoon creepy, mildly disturbing, and would question their intentions, then you really need to think about how other people might view you."
neckbeardstories,36n43s,FinnSven,2,Thu Jun 4 15:19:16 2015 UTC,"Also, people might get really creeped out if you ""have other interests"" and keep your Brony Tendancies hidden.  It really looks like you have a shameful secret."
neckbeardstories,36n43s,FinnSven,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:23:33 2015 UTC,"oh and!   Sorry I forgot this.   There is nothing wrong with creating entertainment for children as a career, of course not.  Just cause it is made by adults does not automatically make it suitable for adults."
neckbeardstories,36n43s,Purplesheepicorn,-5,Thu Jun 4 15:36:15 2015 UTC,That makes no sense. Also as a female in the 18-25 age range who watches cartoons I'm pretty damn mature.  Do you realize how insulting it is to say that you have to be mentally impaired to like a tv show? I don't like being judgmental but you sure as hell sound like an intolerant prick who judges people's worth as a human being on what media they choose to consume while hurting no one. Grow up already.
neckbeardstories,36n43s,FinnSven,0,Thu Jun 4 18:10:02 2015 UTC,"It makes perfect sense. It does not fit with your world view so you are belittling it.   Boldly stating that you are a female in the 18-25 range watching cartoons and saying that you are damn mature does not automatically make you so.  Sure you might have a mature attitude, but its clear you still do not have a mature understanding of the world.  It is not belittling to say that, though I am sure you will take it as so, you are under 26, you have a lot to learn. You may not be fully mature at 30, but you will think differently, or I hope you do.  Granted there are terribly immature 40 year olds, but just assuming you are not going to be like that will not make you so.    There was a time I thought that it was a laugh to go and intimidate trek/sci fi fans and proto bronies, emo kids, ""trendies"" (though they tended to fight back, which was more fun,) but I grew out of it.   Its very judgemental for you to assume automatically that I mean mental impairment as an insult or derogatory term. Persons with downs syndrome for instance frequently develop at different rates and tend to appreciate things that are not considered age appropriate.   I realise that bronies are not actually hurting anyone. The original thing that I was responding to was that you were objecting to liking my little pony making people automatically assume said person is a creepy type.   I was responding that yes, a good proportion of people would find the idea of adult men obsessing over a cartoon well known to be targeted at pre pubescent girls creepy and unwholesome.  I never said that they automatically are potential rapists or abusers, but people unaware of the culture surrounding it would find it creepy on first discovering it. I am willing to bet many more would not understand for what I think are understandable reasons, and continue to find the idea disturbing and questionable.   I know its not the same thing, but a lot of people would find such a thing just as creepy as a person being very forward about their taste for BDSM. And before you say ""BDSM people are all discreet and sensible and don't impose it on others"", there are many who are plain not. I have run into several people who when the subject comes up try to push it on others, especially if you like Industrial music for instance.   What you are trying to argue is that the infantilisation of society is a good thing.   I don't agree. I don't mind people having individual things they like at all. They should understand that other people may not understand these things, to the point of finding them ""red flags"". I don't think people over 18 should be encouraged to celebrate children's cartoons with a near cult like fervour, and I don't think people should consider such ""life choices"" to be expected to blanket accept like sexuality or ethnic background.  I think doing so belittles the former and takes public focus away from real issues that gueninely affect peoples lives.   Also, in the case of bronies, I do think that it should be examined as to why these people are so wrapped up with its messages of friendship.  Clearly they are not getting that need fulfilled by the rest of society, so have identified with this cult like subculture.  I think that is a symptom of something deeper and more problematic in society.   So no, I don't judge peoples worth on what they watch on TV. I judge peoples worth on what they stand for and how they show their integrity."

He was a dropout who ""didn't need a piece of paper (diploma) to show he was smart enough to finish high school."" He demanded I pick up after him when he left rotting mountain dew cans and dorito crumbs all over his room. He'd sleep all day while I was in class and then expect me to cook all his meals, but ONLY if it was deep fried/meat because ""That's what REAL MEN eat."" He didn't have a neckbeard, but I know he was one. Big ego. Obsessed with gaming to the point of neglecting hygiene. No respect for women.   Weird thing: He refused to get a job in my city because that'd require him taking the bus. Lots of Muslim college students rode the bus and he was convinced they were all terrorists."

He said no and asked if that was okay. I said verbatim ""not interested"" and he flew off the handle calling me a slut and cunt and bitch and that he was looking for good people to be friends with and I'm clearly not a good person the kicker was he told me I'm a whore and that I should change my settings to say I hate white guys which is hilarious because it is very evident on my profile that I've been dating a super white ginger for nearly two years now. So I told my boyfriend we can't date anymore because I hate white guys. The dude ended up blocking me before I could report him but I screenshotted it and posted it to my wall. Without my knowledge my boyfriends dad (his family is basically my second family, I'd have done the same if this had happened to my boyfriends sister) messaged him to see what his deal was and when he got cussed out as well and it became incredibly apparent I was not the first person he had done this to, my bfs dad sent screenshots of the conversations to his HR manager. Which felt great."

neckbeardstories,36n43s,epic93,23,Thu May 21 02:00:22 2015 UTC,No he found out where he worked and figured the manager might want to know the guy had been harassing people. It wouldn't have been my choice of action but when I found out it felt good.

We just aced and nailed a perfect show this evening, and the venue who took the risk and put us on wants us to do more events, possibly monthly or biweekly. Spirits are high, so are all us friends, and the night was exciting! But there was this guy. I didn't pay much attention to him, but when I looked he was talking to this girl. And pushing her boundaries, and being an antisocial creep. Throughout their conversation she kept trying to disengage, and he kept not letting her go, even putting an arm around her to pull her back in, being casual and 'haha I'm joking no really but' the entire time.  She told him her age at one point in conversation, something she is sensitive about and that I wouldn't have expected just from knowing her. And he went ""wow really hahaha"" and then announced to us her age, despite her visible upset at him teasing he's going to do that. He actually spat out a mouthful of food into his hand to clear his mouth to tell people. She slapped his arm and pushed his food back into his mouth, which everybody noticed and fell over laughing at.  And then people went back to watching the movie & talking with each other. Next I looked over, he kept trying to kiss her and she kept leaning away. As she did he became fixated on her nose and decided he was going to try shoving his fingers up her nose, again while she's trying to socially and gracefully get away. She had enough of that, and started lightly putting her hand on his face and slapping his face telling him to go away.  He opened his mouth and her fingers went in. She was severely grossed out by this, and then he lightheartedly joked ""hey you put your fingers in my mouth now it's my turn"" and started trying to shove his fingers into her mouth. She turned to leave and he hugged her from behind and started walking her away into the kitchen, and I saw him grabbing her ass with his other hand. I got up and got in his face, and told him he needed to back off and stop this. She seemed very embarassed, and said it was no big deal, they were just playing. I think she didn't want to set him off, but she took the opportunity to duck away and prepare to leave. Then he apologized to her, and he was mumbling apologies...  and that's when he burst out bawling. Sobbing, tears rolling, crying ""I just want to stick my penis in you!"" And there was my night. A grown-ass, late 20s maybe early 30s moderately overweight (but not obese) guy with a beard and long greasy hair and a bowler hat broke down sobbing in front of me and everyone."

Then her neckbeard companion walked over and grabbed my pony tail and started fucking petting it and examining the color, saying ""well it's really more of a fuschia, feminine but not lady like."" and gave the girl he was with a stern look."

We all decided to go (Me, Neckbeard and the other 3 roommates), since none of us really knew anyone, or each other for that matter.  The party gets going, and there's a good mix of people there. Neckbeard is just odd, going on about how bad alcohol is, and makes sure that everyone attending gets to know his opinion. He's generally just creepy the whole party, and he proceeds to add all of the girls on Facebook. Since everyone is our neighbor more or less, neither of them deny.   I meet one girl at the laundromat just 2 days later, and she tells me that Neckbeard have been sending her and her roommates weird messages, of semi-sexual nature. A few days later, I catch him waiting by our front door, peeping through the keyhole, and waiting for some of the girls to go in the hallway, so that he could casually bump in to them.

I told him I didn't want to date him for some very good reasons (he lived with his parents at the age of 30 and had never owned a car or had a license or had a girlfriend or had sex and was basically a giant child) and he saw this as encouragement. Not encouragement to move out or get his license, oh no. Just encouragement to send me LONG LONG LONG Facebook messages about how we should be together and how he felt. Repeatedly after I asked him not to and told him it was scary for me. He continued. I blocked him.   So he lied to a mutual friend and tried to make her ""talk to me"" for him. Ie. pester me to date him. This was all at a party I didn't go to because of him. He was later seen groping a girl's breasts in front of her boyfriend.   This guy also had a habit of not knowing when to leave. Like, if you had people over for lunch, they'd all have a great time and go their separate ways and he'd still be sitting there on the couch. He'd expect to be fed dinner. And driven home. He was invited to a party once and just... stayed. The host woke up the next morning to find him on her couch.   Turns out he sexually assaulted a friend of mine AT HER HOUSE while her boyfriend was upstairs. After insulting the boyfriend's cooking. The friend never told me because she was so traumatized she never told anyone. Just cut everyone out of her life, shut down all her social media and never spoke of it again."

I was just hanging out, didn't know many people because I was new, and ended up playing some super smashed bros with some others. I honestly am average at best when it comes to smash bros, so I ended up getting pretty drunk. This one fucking guy, typical neckbeard in looks and behaviour, only missing the fedora, has been chasing after me all night and I've been politely avoiding him as best as possible, turning him down gently, and generally being disinterested, but he keeps following me trying to talk about his model planes and his favourite anime. He'd been on my tail for a few days beforehand too at school, but I'd been able to avoid him far better there. By this point in the evening I am too drunk to walk on my own, and the world is spinning, I feel like I need to throw up and to this day everything is a blur, but this fucking guy tries to initiate sex, and I'm complaining and drunkenly trying to push him away to no avail. My roommates managed to stop him before he got too far, thank god and a few of my good guy friends beat the absolute shit out of him and kicked him out, but I still have a lot of anxiety issues because of that event."

I politely asked him to not call me so late as I've always needed my sleep. Neckbeard asks me out several times over the course of the play.

As for the subject material itself, as long as it ain't that loli shit, it's harmless. It's the people that obsess over it that need to go away.  On top of that, anime had a huge positive impact on video games, western animation, and what have you. Saying it deserves to go away is frankly moronic. It has its place."

neckbeardstories,3696ax,Particlepants,25,Sun May 17 11:42:32 2015 UTC,"Kudos for becoming less confrontational and more open to other perspectives. You're off to a great start and I only have one serious point to offer: regardless of what you think, you don't look good in a fedora (nobody does for that matter). It's not the 1940's, and you're not Clark Gable. Stop wearing it, and as you branch out into the world more it will no longer be holding you back. The public hatred of fedoras is not because of the hats themselves (regardless of how dorky they are), but the fact that people ""know"" what kind of person they're looking at when they see them. So it's for your own good to stop wearing it, because people will give you a clean slate for it."
neckbeardstories,3696ax,Cross-Country,15,Sun May 17 13:40:56 2015 UTC,"Depends if it is an actual fedora or a trilby. Bear with me, this is a tad ponderous.   My husband wears a very nice (rather costly) wool fedora with a very nice trench coat  and umbrella on blustery, rainy days. He looks like someone in London trying to keep dry. He does not ever wear the hat indoors or on days that doesn't warrant it. That's okay because he is wearing the hat for the purpose it was intended. He is also a man who is educated, accomplished and looks it. This can not be faked by just wearing a hat.  The problem with the beards is that they wear their hat ALL THE FREAKING TIME!  They believe the hat somehow bestows onto them the patina of gentility. They are completely ignorant of the etiquette regarding headwear, and for that matter gentlemanly behavior. This also extends into the wooing of the m'ladies. They see themselves as genteel yet are completely without actual manners and knowledge. When rebuffed, the revert back to their true selves.  So, keep the Fedora (unless it is a trilby then get rid of it as soon as humanly possible. ) However, learn how and when to wear it."

It first appeared in 1882 as a female hat. The hat was soon a popular fashion for women especially for women’s-rights activists.   Soon it was seen as a cheaper alternative to bowlers, since it's felt, and doesn't lose it's shape easily, and still stylish since Prince Edward wore one."

It's only later that GW got rid of all non in-house publications, it used to be the Wizards of the coast of Britain.  The only companies that actually have ripped off GW are Blizzard and a few other lesser ones like Mantic, although really in the lesser cases they only got business because they were giving consumers what GW wouldn't.

neckbeardstories,35lpbv,HeeroToast,9,Mon May 11 18:51:00 2015 UTC,"That could be. I had never seen the guy before, but it could be that he normally came during not-my-shifts. Still, insisting that he knew the owner and that it was 'totally cool' to do what he did seems like normal neckbeard behavior to me. Especially in the niche of gaming, too many people think that saying they know the owner allows them to get away with murder."
neckbeardstories,35lpbv,FinnSven,4,Mon May 11 19:03:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, I in no way disagree that this guy is neckbeard as fuck. I was only questioning whether or not it was his date who had led him there, all things considered. Seriously how fucking delusional must he be...I feel like that must be some kind of undocumented mental disorder.   Warhammorphia: Sufferers of this mental disorder see the game ""Warhammer 40,000"" wherever they look, no matter how disparate the subject of their criticism is to the game mechanics of Warhammer. They then feel the compulsive urge to loudly dictate their observations to others."
neckbeardstories,35lpbv,kingdomcome3914,3,Mon May 11 23:34:00 2015 UTC,"""knowing the owners"" is not just a neckbeard tactic to justify inappropriate behavior in public places  I heard it a lot when in bars, both working and as a customer. Mostly it was people trying to avoid paying for drinks or being caught in places they should not have been.  Once it was a guy who came into a rock night club I worked in. He got upset a guard would not let him into the disco room where a ticket entry band was playing.  When I explained that he should have asked to be on the guest list if he wanted to see the band, he said he did not care about the band but should be allowed to go everywhere in the club as he ""knew the owner"".   In my experience, its usually that they have spoken to the owner once or twice when the owner has been on walkabout in the bar.  If the owner wants people to drink for free, they let the staff know very clearly.   I am sure a game shop owner would make it clear to staff who could open merchandise, in a similar regard."

neckbeardstories,35lpbv,Jajoo,1 point,Mon May 11 23:04:13 2015 UTC,"They are two separate games.  Warhammer 40,000 is a sci-fi game that takes place in the 41st millennium, which was invented back in the 1980s (this is the reason it's the most popular tabletop game; it's been around the longest).    Warhammer Fantasy is another game by the same company that came out later.  Think of it as like a prequel to the 40k universe. It has some factions and races on planets that are similar to the ones in 40k, but they're more primitive or medieval.     Despite what you may hear (from stories like this), tabletop games are incredibly fun.  The learning curve can be a bit steep at first, but if you're into strategy games of any kind (RTSs, chess, board games, turn-based RPGs), you'll pick it up.  The environment they foster is usually very social and fun, and in my experience this drives away the worst of the neckbeards.    Try looking at Warmachine or Infinity for a first-time game.  Infinity is by far the cheapest to get into, but may not be as popular and the engine is very detailed (might be harder to learn).  Warmachine is mid-range cost, mid-range difficulty to learn, and very well balanced.  Warhammer is my least favorite because of how expensive and unbalanced it is, but the models are well-made and it's easy to learn.    If anything, just wander into your nearest game store on a night when any tabletop games are being played.  Ask them for a demo; they'll be happy to explain things to you."

No one else was there when I arrived, they hadn't even set up. About an hour later they started setting up in the shopping centre, another hour later guests started arriving but no fans had turned up yet, just early shoppers. I decided to get autographs straight away. I put my book and pen down on the table, said how much of a fan of him I was and kinda gushed. I then asked in my most polite voice ""could I perhaps have an autograph please?"" And suddenly my entire world crumpled around me. His eyes shot wide open and his face was an image of fear, I actually stepped back frightened that I had upset him. Until the dwarf actress sat next to him leaned across slapping his shoulder and said ""Autograph, Kenny!"" He then displayed a massive grin and happily signed my book."

Needless to say, he's also the only one I could invite to my house to have fun with. But instead of having fun like normal friends supposed to do, he just took my computer, insisted me watching him playing this ""very cool game"" he'd just bought then spent 3-4 hours using MY COMPUTER to play those game as if he's lost in it. During that time, I just went away and did my homeworks, reading some comic books and even finished lunch! (He said he didn't want to eat because he's  ""too focus"").

neckbeardstories,359afu,sometimesiameuphoric,38,Fri May 8 04:27:43 2015 UTC,"Hey man,  I'm glad you're voicing your concern here, as some of your criticism is valid, I'll give you that. I mean, you had it hard, right? Peope bullied you for your love of things that are not quite the mainstream, girls scorned you and pretty much everything was shit as soon as you left the house. Or still do, I don't know how old you are. But I'm not here to gloat or laugh at you, because, you see, I've been there. I grew up in a place where my cultural background and my preferences in pretty much anything clashed with that of the natives so hard that there was no chance I'd ever fit in. And sure, I do watch the occasional anime - and if it's only a few episodes of something like Attack on Titan every few months (gotta love that first theme song) - and I own a pair of cargo shorts. I lacked the fedora, though.  But all this isn't really what this subreddit is about. And while you're getting some hate in the comments here already, I think it's important for you to read them and hopefully understand something. By this I don't mean learn, but understand. And that's one simple thing: We are free.  I'm not speaking of the American Freedom (TM) or anything, but actual freedom. We're free to believe whatever we like. We can believe the Earth was made by a God or we can put our belief in Capital-S Science (TM) - you know, the Reddit variety. We can believe that anime is superior to everything else. And there's nothing to stop us. As much as people scream at you for believing something, or call you the worst scum of the earth, they can't take that belief from you.  You, on the other hand, can't take their beliefs from them. They're free to believe that the New York Rangers are the greatest team out there, that Japan isn't the alpha and omega of modern culture and that a gym is better than a church.  Still, I'd like to talk to you like an adult here and give you a few words on your way, however hypocritical that may sound.   My vocabulary is larger than normal   That is wonderful. I love language and using weird words every now and then. What I've discovered over the many years of my life now is that it's not the fact that you use them, it's how you use them. It's not cool to use medieval language, to run with the common example of M'Lady that seems prevalent here. There's a reason for that, purely lingustical that few people realize. There are all the societal ones such as ""Your lady"" implies possession, which is just not very nice. You don't own anyone.  But the point I'm trying to make is this: Language is a wild thing. It constantly evolves and sometimes goes in circles. New words come as the world keeps spinning, others go. M'Lady went. It might have been cool at some point, but it's no longer nice, appropriate and whatnot.  Also, having a vocabulary is awesome. But as you can plainly see on /r/iamverysmart, there's knowing language and words and there's rubbing it in. Use the words, play with them, but don't go ""I will now use my vocabulary to confound and befuddle and vex my comrades whom I loathe"". That crap will get you nowhere.  Sidenote: Casually slipping Japanese terms into language doesn't work. You're not going to make Senpai happen. You need broader mass appeal and a bigger outlet for that. See Battlestar Galactica and Frak for an example.   I happen to enjoy anime over American shows?   Wonderful. That's great for you. I sort of don't. I like me my super hero shows. The Flash is amazing, Arrow's about to get good again and if I don't get my weekly dose of Game of Thrones - even though I have issues keeping half the names straight in it (according to me, there's a guy in there whose name alternates between Gimli and Guernsey) - I'll feel like I've missed out on something. Seriously, I think it's amazing that you're aware of your media consumption to a point where you can say that you prefer something over something else. You're not one of the guys who just turns on the telly and then watches whatever. Kudos to you.  But again, we're free. We're free to dislike, sometimes strongly, whatever we want. When I say that I dislike some tropes in anime - big hero saves the world only to be confronted by even stronger enemy, seriously? - I like others such as the wonderful fight scenes. Sure, the things I like and dislike are not part of every anime, but hey, it's what I know of the medium.  Which brings me to my next point. Education. It's not your place to come and educate me against my will. It's not that I don't understand, maybe I do and I don't need you to lecture me. Maybe I have had a bad day and your enthusiasm coupled with the underlying message of You pleb know nothing is the last thing I need.  Besides, what if I am perfectly happy with the shows I watch and even if I would like to watch more shows maybe, I'd lack the time to do so? No amount of Watch Kill La Kill will change anything about that.   Well maybe, just maybe, after decades of torment I want to be the one to spit back for a change!   Let me ask you one question: Why?  Why would you want to spit back. Even assuming you could win this fight you're willingly getting yourself into and into the bullying/counter-bullying thing you're willingly endulging: What do you think will come from it?  You're not going to be more popular. You're not making anyone's day better. You're just a horrible human being, no better than them. You're willingly inflicting or trying to inflict the same shame, the same hurt and the same anger into others that you've loathed for so many years. Look at yourself, look at what you're doing. Seriously, man, don't do spit back. Enjoy the things you enjoy. Live the way you want to live. Don't expect the world to pussyfoot around you but don't make it hard for them to like it.   I own in excess of 15000 comic books from all corners of the world, including Japan. In my school days, I got a lot of shit for it. But I kept reading them. Because I liked them. In the end, that's all that matters. These days, when I tell people that I own 15000 comic books, they look at me with a ""Woah, good job, man"" look on their face and we talk about comics for a bit. I tell them that few people get Superman, that Tintin is frickin' awesome and that I have mad love for Tsutomu Nihei's BLAME!. All in all, we share good times based on my hobby. They tell me how they read Mickey Mouse comics as a kid, I reminisce with them. I tell them that I like all kinds of comics because I love the stories and the medium. I have not once gotten backlash for it in my adult life.  Based on that, I am not giving anyone shit for their hobbies either.   say what you will, but living until my 80s eating tofu and doing tedious, strenuous calisthenics is a lot less appealing than enjoying myself with the food that I love and doing what I love: internets.   The first three weeks at the gym are bad. I vividly remember those. It's a struggle. But it will end up being rewarding. Give it a go and tough it out for a month. Seriously, there's nothing I can recommend more than joining and going to a gym.  But there are a few things you need to observe.   Don't go pointlessly. Set your goals. Mine was ""I want to be able to do one pull-up"". And I could do that after a few weeks. Then I got ambitious and five years later, I'm still going to the gym three times a week. Don't go exercising for the sake of exercising. Find out where you want to go with your body. Do you want to be strong? Do you want to be a runner? Consult people who work at the gym. They're there to help and even if the internet disagrees with them, the guys at the gym can see you and coach you. Use that chance. Do your research. See what you can do to help you along the way. Nutrition is a lot more important but way less strict than you think. Find a gym buddy. Be nice to the people at the gym.   And it's not about becoming a meat head. It's about becoming the best version of yourself that you can possibly be. Going to the gym, your posture will improve, your general body tension isn't that of a blob but you tense up. You won't be winded after two flights of stairs anymore. You will sleep better and be more alert when awake. The sex will be better.   The gym is one of the things that I was most surprised to discover that I actually enjoy it. The other recent example of this was working with large animals.  Lastly, I want to talk to you about this sub for a bit.   This is not about demonizing people. It's about catharsis and laughter. Most people here have had some neckbeardy tendencies in the past. Hell, I had them. I still have them, I'd guess. It's an outlet to deal with people we really don't want to deal with. They're people who give fans of anything a bad name, people who give every sane person the creeps. They're the neckbeards who smell bad and are, according to all accounts, slobs and feel entitled. They're neither particularly nice or they expect some immediate gratification for their niceness.  The worst: They probably know it. Maybe not during the day, but the five minutes before they fall asleep in their beds, the times you feel attacked by posts in this subreddit, that's when you know that you're not okay and you could do better. This is why I wrote this post for you. I want you to do better. I want you to have both your hobby and friends. Because, seriously, talking about comics with people you've just met is so much nicer than having to deal with incessant small talk about the weather, the local sports team or whatever else.  EDIT: Fixed some typos. Nothing major."

neckbeardstories,34x3nk,sweetlemongrass,7,Wed May 6 06:56:55 2015 UTC,"As for your second point, I just want to point out that being ""normal"" in Asian cultures actually is going above and beyond.   Now I'm going to preface this with that I live in China, not Japan, (and despite still hating each other over WWII, they still have more in common than say, the US and Japan).   They don't do things like hold doors, be a shoulder, wait in a goddmaned line. And things like cheating are very common, while domestic abuse and rape don't get nearly enough awareness and don't have nearly enough laws to protect victims-- for example, spousal rape is not considered to be rape here, if you beat your wife you won't get in trouble as long as you tell her before hand ""this is why I'm beating you,"" and as for cheating, having a mistress is considered to be a status symbol. Also anyone who is open about supporting women's rights and fixing these issues is openly referred to as a ""women's rights bitch.""   Now, this isn't all of China, and I understand that this makes China look really really bad, when it's really not that prevalent (just because these things are legal doesn't mean that they're common).    So, for point number 2, the rest of the world looks shitty compared to the main character because the rest of the world might actually be shitty.  Again, I'm looking at China, not Japan, because I live here and have more experience with Chinese culture, but that's my experience and my knowledge of Asian cultures... If anyone wants to point out differences between these Chinese laws and some Japanese laws and tell me ""no, you're wrong"" be my guest, educate me because I really don't know, but as of now, that's what I see."

neckbeardstories,34x3nk,Vandelay_Latex_Sales,4,Fri May 8 20:31:07 2015 UTC,"I think your theory has a merit to it, but I don't think anime and manga are the only source of neckbeardery.  I think it's kind of like weed- some people smoke and are perfectly fine and functional, and others become shitty, obnoxious, lazy stoners.  I think the 'beard comes from a sense of entitlement that comes from some feeling of isolation from the rest of humanity. Things like misogyny, intellectual arrogance (even if the 'beard in question is as dumb as a sack of bricks), and exceptional lack of social skills are all learned behaviors that have to come from somewhere, and no one thing causes all of that.  The misogyny is a result of a number of things:   Entertainment that tells boys that they can get whatever hot girl they want, no matter how nerdy and socially inept they are. This turns women into objects that can be earned by putting blind effort forward. The same entertainment that tells less physically apt males that the stronger, more attractive, athletic males are inherently stupid and are the villains that women must be saved from, again turning women into objects that must be saved. Here, we find white knights and ""nice guys"" who get mad at assholes. To the ""nice guys,"" they legitimately think that they exist to save women from whatever stereotypical Chad they've imagined. Some amount of rejection, due to whatever reasons. Overly attached mothers who try to serve the child in every possible way. Mothers like this exist, and they introduce and reenforce the idea that women exist solely to pander to the needs of the 'beard. When women don't act this way, the 'beards get angry because they belief they are inherently deserving of motherly treatment.   The intellectual arrogance is related to the things above:   Entertainment tells them that smart people are persecuted by the bigger, stronger, and more athletic males. If the young 'beard is not big, strong, and athletic, they assume that they will be persecuted, and then assume that they are smart. They have some degree of academic talent early on in school. They probably did well on some standardized test, and the school sent some note home to Super Mommy about how the 'beard-to-be is advanced. This is internalized by Super Mommy as ""My baby is brilliant!"" and is presented to him as such. The 'beard-to-be embraces this fully and believes himself to be superior. Super mommy, and whomever else, helps him with his homework, which gives him an advantage early on in life. When Super Mommy stops doing that, the 'beard doesn't increase the effort he puts into his school, and ends up a lazy high schooler who doesn't do his homework and has a poor GPA. He is slightly above average intellectually, and overplays that a LOT. He believes that his intellectual skills make him some kind of super man.   And the lack of social skills:   Limited interaction with other children. Some parents, especially the overly involved types, like the ""Super Mommy"" that I mentioned, tightly regulate who their children play with at an early age. This is detrimental. Alternatively, they don't make the effort to socialize their children. The child stays with the parent at all times and isn't given the chance to play. The child is largely left to his own devices, when not being ""Mommmied"", and ends up in a made-up fantasy land inside of his own head. Imagination is certainly a gift, but when left alone, people tend to retreat into their own little worlds. I do this a lot, too. When the child has total control over their environment, they don't know how to adapt and react to others very well. Here, we find the weird fashion- the neck beards aren't around others to learn how the pack dresses. They spend time watching movies/TV and playing vidya. They fashion themselves around that, mixed with whatever they can afford and what they find comfortable. They see movies with cool guys wearing fedoras, and then think that they should wear a fedora. Who doesn't want to look like Indiana Jones? (Never mind the fact that Harrison Ford never went on stage with a flame fedora). The cheap leather jackets, pseudo-dress clothing, and weird obsession with gloves come from this as well. The poor hygiene comes from a lack of proper education about the subject, and a lack of understanding about social customs. The believe that if they don't care, nobody else will care. It's a ""it's only hurting me"" mentality.   Anyway. I could go on, I guess, but I've kind of lost my train of thought, and I'm rambling. Basically, I think that a lot of the neck beard mentality comes from entertainment, but much more of it comes from the beard's home life, and that early home life carries into the beard's later interactions with others, which then forges him into a full neckbeard.   When you look at the more famous stories, like those of /u/Lady_Sabre, the mother of ""Ser Sam"" is incredibly accommodating, and doesn't really understand her child. She just wants to help him be happy and pursue his interests, and she is only aware of what she is being told. The extreme level of parental accommodation contributes to Sam's manipulation and lack of social skills. He never learned to socialize properly, and doesn't know how to exist within a social structure.  Basically, I believe that all social behavior is learned, and the traits of a neckbeard are learned from social interactions, especially while while young. To combat neckbeardism, children must be socialized properly early on. That means not bending to the every whim of children, and ensuring that said children play with other children and learn how to coexist with peers. This takes effort, but having a child is hard."

This often creates issues with survivors because they worry there's something wrong with them because their body reacted differently then their mind.  Not being Japanese myself I can only theorize from what I remember reading about Japanese culture. If I remember correctly there is a strong desire in Japanese culture for women to be pure, similar to Conservative Christians, so obviously it needs to hurt the women because sex hurts on the first time (lol amirite girls?) so that the self-insert character can appear to be getting it on with a virgin but she should also take to sex like a master because it makes the porn flow better, thus the enjoyment."

I also imagine the actual Darth Bane doesn't resemble Bane due to copyright reasons. As for the girlfriend thing, I think his endgoal from what I could gather seemed to be to have a threesome with his girlfriend and the person he was cheating with. Yes, he's that delusional."

Take that for the win you get.  No, I dunno if there's anything you can do about it.  Thing is, there are a whole lot of people in the world who haven't met him yet.  If he's getting on by suckering people in until they learn for themselves, and if he's unwilling to change himself as long as there is a pool of future suckers still left to wade through, then you can't even warn off the people he's just starting to meet.  They do have to learn for themselves that he's a toxic sonofabitch without a heart of gold behind the crust.  I have known people who build around themselves the sort of crust which makes you feel like there's a legitimate reason they're hard to get to know.  You really want to give them the benefit of the doubt, because you can envision yourself in the same difficulties.  People who've gone through all sorts of shit physically, emotionally, mentally, through things which have happened to them, you name it... I give them a chance.  Sometimes it pays off!  But the majority of the time what you find is that if this were a good human being it would already have overcome the crap surrounding it to exhibit that goodness on the surface, too.  If it hasn't, then unfortunately more often or not it's because there isn't a good person under there trying to get out.  Trust what people show you, because we want to become the best of what we are and we'll show you the best that we can summon up to be."

Morgan is stuck on a course with him and there's very few people on the course, so he just gets on with him so it doesn't mean having to deal with him five days a week while he's pissed off.

neckbeardstories,33vnvg,ProNoob95,11,Sun Apr 26 03:31:48 2015 UTC,"be charged as minor most likely could be tried as an adult though  charged for harassment, stalking(maybe), attempted rape or sexual assault or just assault   punishment will rely on if he has a plea bargain and takes it. If he does not it will depend on what state or country. In Utah where I am if it is determined that he is tried as an adult he could be charged with a first(5 to life) or second(1 to 15) degree felonies. he could also face fines of up to $10000 dollars"
neckbeardstories,33vnvg,MrDoctorSmartyPants,5,Sun Apr 26 04:03:31 2015 UTC,So he's definitely not walking away from this without some sort of punishment then?
neckbeardstories,33vnvg,Hush009,7,Sun Apr 26 05:58:56 2015 UTC,He will receive some form of punishment. I can't remember how old he is but everyone else is saying he is a minor. My guess is he will be charged with assault but I don't think there's enough there for battery as well. Stalking and harassment charges are a definite because they have plenty  of evidence that confirms it.

neckbeardstories,33vnvg,SpikeFJE,1 point,Mon Apr 27 06:59:52 2015 UTC,"Hi Spaz, so I stumbled across this story and looked at the older ones and holy crap, awesome.   So now that I've said that, I wanted to say something about your friend Raina.   8 months ago I lost my oldest brother to a misdiagnosed heart condition. 3 months after that my father lost his battle with chronic disease. So it's been a pretty fucked up few months.   Someone else already mentioned this but I just wanted to reiterate it. When you lose someone close to you, everyone is very understanding. For about 2 weeks. Then they go back to normal life and you are still sitting there just hurting. People I've talked to have told me that it never not hurts, but you learn to deal with it and eventually you can think about that person and remember the good things, not just the pain of losing them.   In the most accidentally fucked up way possible, the Weeb probably did some good for Raina, because I imagine terror is an excellent way to distract yourself from grief. Long term also she can look back at this period and know with her own hands she fought and won. So I wish this didn't have to happen but if it did this was a good time for it. I know that sounds insane but after my brother died I just wanted something I could crush or kill or win. I felt so fucking helpless.   Sorry this is long and rambly and weird. Just be there for her, and if sometimes she goes silent and is staring at nothing at all just kind of shake her a little and let her know you're around. It hasn't been a year yet, but it does get a bit easier. It doesn't go away, you don't forget, but it's not so crushingly awful as it is at first.   tl;dr Raina is a fucking warrior and victory is a balm for many wounds. But grief stays with you and takes a long time to really heal and it always leaves a scar."

No words on how many he killed, or the thrill of liberating the city. He talked about the fear. Of sitting in the ruined shell of somebody's home and seeing a blackened arm not three feet from where you are. Of watching one of your best friends drop lifelessly from a sniper's bullet.

Now it's just like ""oh, we're going to take elements from all of these bands and say it's ours"" it isn't.

As for your opinion on creepypasta, though, I'm kinda buggered that you're saying they're almost all bad. The ""popular"" ones that everyone knows about are usually popular because of people outside the general creepypasta community.

It's a fighting style that's all about self defense, so you don't have to deal with nit-picky form or fancy kicks. Training is also based on what you should do in real life scenarios (like a guy is pointing a knife at your back, someone's grabbing you from the side, how to disarm a gunman, etc.) and forces you to go through the motions over and over and over again so it becomes more of a reaction when you need to defend yourself fast."

neckbeardstories,32vpz5,I_AMA_spaz,80,Fri Apr 17 02:40:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly the best advice I can give is this: do everything in your power to avoid a physical confrontation. If he breaks in, lock yourselves in a room and call the police. If he is bigger and stronger than you you'll be hard pressed to win that fight, so avoid it. If he tries to get into the room you've locked yourself in, tell him you have a gun or something, then buckle down, barricade the door and wait for the police."
neckbeardstories,32vpz5,snowballtherebel,27,Fri Apr 17 02:51:32 2015 UTC,"OK, but if he gets through the door?"
neckbeardstories,32vpz5,Automatic-Stop,51,Fri Apr 17 02:54:17 2015 UTC,"Then tell him you called the police, he won't want to be there when then show up. If he's still coming then be prepared to beat the motherfucking cunting shit out of him with that bat."
neckbeardstories,32vpz5,AggressiveBurrito,27,Fri Apr 17 03:00:02 2015 UTC,Then you call the fucking police. There is no other option that will help you.  I tell you this as someone who lost a friend to someone like this guy.  Don't be stupid.
neckbeardstories,32vpz5,il_vincitore,2,Fri Apr 17 04:43:06 2015 UTC,"Police. Seriously, call the police. But it shouldn't get to that point because you'll keep the doors and windows locked and call the police as soon as he shows up. If he breaks in between you calling and the police arriving, you lock yourself into a room and hide.  If you're in danger and on the phone with dispatch, they'll want to keep you on the line until help arrives. Keep them informed of everything going on so the police know what they're walking into.   Also, as soon as you're able to, talk to someone at the school about the stalking. Tell them everything, each occasion he's showed up uninvited, the nonstop texting, the pestering, the stalking, how you and your friend don't feel safe at school anymore because he isn't leaving you alone. And I don't care what your friend's crazy mom says, you get her butt down to the police department and file a report. Will going to the police potentially cause her and her family some drama? Maybe. BUT the drama filing a report could cause will be potentially less extreme compared to ignoring the problem and allowing it to escalate. Your dad seems very understanding, so if it comes down to it, ask him to drive you down to make the report.  Please be safe and smart about this situation. This guy is not going to leave your friend alone until someone steps in and stops him."
neckbeardstories,32vpz5,il_vincitore,39,Fri Apr 17 18:48:35 2015 UTC,"At this point, you might need a protective order, and while she doesn't want to get police involved, it needs to be done if there is this much fear."
neckbeardstories,32vpz5,il_vincitore,24,Fri Apr 17 03:13:24 2015 UTC,"She's afraid of him, but she is terrified that if she gets the police involved it el cause her parents to break up, however I'm trying to convince her otherwise."
neckbeardstories,32vpz5,Injected_Americas,47,Fri Apr 17 03:26:50 2015 UTC,"The parents are away now, and if getting the police involved causes a break up, there was much more there already that would have caused it. Safety is first priority."
neckbeardstories,32vpz5,justcurious02144,33,Fri Apr 17 03:28:52 2015 UTC,"The police have been called, they are putting a cruiser outside my house for the night."
neckbeardstories,32vpz5,DammitCollins,15,Fri Apr 17 03:41:25 2015 UTC,"Good, and you can give information on the guy, (be sure to tell everything you can about past behavior), with her parents probably never knowing."
neckbeardstories,32vpz5,SLGC,3,Fri Apr 17 03:43:19 2015 UTC,"Poor girl, my heart goes out to her. If y'all ever come to Montana, drop me a line, I'd be more than happy to help you guys out."
neckbeardstories,32vpz5,PM_ME_STAB_WOUNDS,3,Fri Apr 17 04:41:44 2015 UTC,SO MUCH THIS.  Fuck her parents for saying something like that.
neckbeardstories,32vpz5,monster-baiter,24,Fri Apr 17 14:06:26 2015 UTC,"While I'm understanding that the parents are having a rough time in their marriage, they kinda need to realize that their daughter (the product of their love) is currently dealing with a problem that's coming very close to being unable to handle by herself alone. They can (and should) set aside their shit to help her through it.  Seconding the protective order and police involvement, especially now that it's not just her, but also you in danger by extension. This shouldn't be allowed to develop any worse than it already has."
neckbeardstories,32vpz5,flippant_owl,4,Fri Apr 17 03:48:28 2015 UTC,"Good on you for calling the police, but seriously remember this: your safety can not be put aside for their emotions. If they don't understand your worries, that's on them. Do not let other people decide if you are in the clear to call the cops if you feel threatened. Their behavior is selfish and frankly unacceptable. If you do not feel safe, you act on it. Period."
neckbeardstories,32vpz5,littleglowingfriend,29,Fri Apr 17 13:57:44 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, yeah he's snapped. I had a close friend in a similar situation (death in the family) a once casual creeper saw this as his chance to be her knight in shining armor, and when it seemed like she was picking herself back up without his help, he jumped into full-creeper mode.   In short, he was offended that she was leaving him out of her healing (he saw it as being excluded from a golden opportunity he was entitled to) going as far as ""calling her out"" for being insensitive for recovering so well without his help, and yes, he even tried sabotaging her progress to drag her back down to a mental state where he felt he had a chance. That stunt the weeb pulled at the park, reminding your friend what she was trying to move past? Fucker wasn't being oblivious, my friend's stalker bombarded her with that shit all the time. Justified it by saying something like ""you can't really heal by ignoring it, nobody is helping as much as I am"". She said she felt disgusted that the memory of her brother was being tainted because a desperate ""nice guy"" was using it as an emotional weapon.   So yeah, I feel you here, a bit. I recommend restraining order, but first I recommend stockpiling evidence to make it stick. Save some of those thousand word texts, throw in a few ""leave me alone"" replies to future texts so it will be well documented his advances are unwanted, and he isn't taking no for an answer. If you can catch him on tape trying to break into your house, or taking creep photos, that's golden.   For the immediate, barricade yourselves well and toss out a few red herrings. Have a friend post on Facebook that you all snuck out and tag all of you at the movie theaters or something, maybe he'll leave the house alone for a night. Being sneaky works well at first, but it'll probably piss him off in the long run so work on that restraining order asap  Best of luck!"

HAVE THEY NO SELF AWARENESS??"
neckbeardstories,32vpz5,mladybot,26,Sun Apr 19 20:43:11 2015 UTC,"Fuck her parent's relationship. She doesn't feel safe. Go to the police and help her get a restraining order. Obsession can turn to action. If something happens, can you guys honestly say you tried everything to protect her? At minimum bring this to the attention of your school councilors.    Keep vigilant.  Be safe. Get her help."
neckbeardstories,32vpz5,OmniscientSpork,19,Fri Apr 17 03:59:26 2015 UTC,"Her parent's marriage is so fragile that protecting their daughter will push it over the edge? There are so many things wrong with this statement that I don't know where to start. Call the police now and use the witnesses and texts to obtain a restraining order. Her mom either doesn't understand the danger of the situation or refuses to see it so her opinion is irrelevant along with her fears for her crumbling marriage. As a father of a daughter, this fellow would already be a smoldering cautionary tale to any other strange fucker that chose to look at my daughter cross eyed. Call the cops and let every adult you know your situation. Surely one of them has some sense."
neckbeardstories,32vpz5,Ainrana,13,Fri Apr 17 09:34:53 2015 UTC,"Get police involved now. At least call them to make it known what is going on, and get them in your side.   If the neckbeard breaks in, it would be better to have the police ready and prepared, rather than having you wait.  (Explanation: give them a call to let them know you are unsafe, or even feeling unsafe, because of this guy. Ask for some sort of patrol every hour or so, and a cop will circle your area to check for suspicious subjects, while also scaring away the neckbeard. If, heaven forbid, he manages to break in, you have police ready and knowledgable of your situation)."

neckbeardstories,32vpz5,Turkeytacobuttcheese,7,Fri Apr 17 03:27:23 2015 UTC,"Please, please take care. This is bad stuff.    Might be a good idea to print those screenshots of the harassing texts. Start a written diary/timeline of the escalating behavior. This will help you organize your thoughts. Another benefit is it can be read. This spares you from the emotional stress of having to relive the events every time the history must be retold. Maybe seeing everything in black and white will administer a reality check to the adults who need to quit being so self-centered.  If Mom can't handle the stress (I imagine she is grieving too) then she needs to designate someone who can. Your friend needs an adult advocate. I'm a mom. If my child was being stalked, I would be demanding a creep head on a platter. (After it was separated from the neckbeard.) Hope this helps."

neckbeardstories,32vpz5,BrokenRanger,3,Fri Apr 17 03:08:13 2015 UTC,"I doubt he'll try to break in, but in the rare chance he does and you can't escape/hide while you phone the police (like other people suggested so far) and it comes to an altercation here's my best advice: fight as dirty as possible. Claw from the middle of his face outwards to increase your odds on hitting/gouging his eye(s), attack the major joints especially the knees if he's a bigger dude, and punch/grab the throat and nuts. Should halt his attack and give you and Raina enough   get away.  Also, if you have to bail from the house make sure both you and Raina know which direction to head from the house and stick together so you two don't accidentally lose each other. ""We're both going (insert direction from house when looking at the front of it) if we need to, the  next house is (distance) away."""

neckbeardstories,32vpz5,callanrocks,3,Fri Apr 17 16:19:24 2015 UTC,Are there texts where he actually threatens to come after her? You can show them to the police.
neckbeardstories,32vpz5,Jeanei,3,Fri Apr 17 04:11:59 2015 UTC,"The first rule of self defense is avoid confrontation. If you have to get physical and believe your life is in danger use everything you can to subdue him. Kick him in the groin, gouge his eyes with your thumb, use a weapon of some sort. A baseball bat may look threatening, but you might not do a lot of damage. A knife is easy to use, light and is very hard to wrestle away from someone unless you have training. Police are the best option though for any situation you feel unsafe to the point you fear physical harm."

First, lock all doors and windows, inform all your friends of everything. Be ready to call the police and have a safe space to go to in the house with some form of baracade (in extreme measures, I don't think it'll be needed).   For the long term this NEEDS to be done. Through text, Facebook messager and or email have her tell him explicetly that you do not want him to contact her again, then screen caption it. If he does it again GO TO THE POLICE. He's now violating her wishes, make sure she saves and screen captions everything, and show them. If she's addiment about not going, go to your teacher. Go tomorrow, show them the texts, and ask them for help. Go to every adult authority figure you can. You cannot properly handle this on your own, trust me, don't do what I did."

I don't give a shit what her parents say. GET THE COPS INVOLVED. That guys is dangerous and your friend could end up hurt or worst.   That cruser for the night was great, but you need a more permanent solution. Go to your local police station, show them the messages, the non stop harrassing and everything.   Her parent saying that their marriage is more important than her safety is bullshit, especially after leaving her alone for 2 freaking weeks. If they wont protect her, she needs to do it herself.

Posting this little blurb was my friend's idea. I didn't know if it was an actual neckbeard in the wild or just a roving idiot...

Its the curse of modern times: you somehow got disconnected from your peers so you use more and more internet, asking for explanations. There, you find all these pseudo-explanation on how to appear cool and alpha and all and you try them in real life. Even when they does not work, you are still receiving rejecting signlas from the real world and encouragement from internet, so you move on to the ""plebs and gentlesir"" phase where everyone is stupid - but you.  Internet is great, but if it is your ONLY social outlet will make you as crazy as its worse surfers. And we know the net is full of crazies."

Many of the neckbeards we encounter are awkward, maybe creepy, but harmless. They actually ARE nice guys underneath their awkwardness. I doubt this guy is like that. He seems legitimately creepy and intimidating, and only someone with very low empathy and respect for others would purposely kill an animal for no reason, and in such a provocatively violent way. He could be harmless, who knows, but I'd run far and fast if I were her, just in case"

If this went down the way you described, he was way out if line to get up in your personal space and touch you - after you had made it clear you weren't interested. I'm sorry, but there really isn't enough formatting to express how wrong that is.   You don't have to put up with that from anyone. This guy has no excuse, no right to get away with treating people like that, so stand up for yourself and for everyone else he might intimidate. Report him."

There is no excuse for this kind of shit.  It probably wouldn't hurt to share it around school first, though. Tell all your friends that he said this and it scared you, but you don't know what to do about it. Later that day, you'll tell the school and then hopefully the police, but by then, the warning will be spreading to other potential victims. Plus if anyone who's heard this sees him bothering you, they know what's up and can try to help."

He GOES TO MY UNI AND IS ALWAYS AROUND. Imagine telling Nm To straight up fuck off. He 100% wouldn't. And shit would be a lot worse if I did piss him off. It's a risk I'm not willing to take.
neckbeardstories,32c8vk,RygarTargaryan,8,Mon Apr 13 11:30:11 2015 UTC,"Imagine telling Nm To straight up fuck off. He 100% wouldn't. And shit would be a lot worse if I did piss him off. It's a risk I'm not willing to take.   That's what restraining orders are for. When he said   “I've done some bad shit in my time, and the things I view on the internet might mirror the things I have done, but in a way it’s better than actually re-doing what I have done, and by looking at words and pictures on the internet, it’s more legal and moral. I am proud of myself.”   he was either fronting or confessing. If he's fronting, you should be worried that he thinks it's cool to pretend to have done such reprehensible things in the past. If he's confessing, then the fact that he feels comfortable discussing it in depth with you means he's sizing up his next victim: you.  Once you tell him that you don't want to be alone with him and he flips out, take all of your documentation, including his hints that he's done this sort of thing in the past, to the police and get a restraining order. Your uni may be able to assist you."
neckbeardstories,32c8vk,Ajkrumen,7,Mon Apr 13 14:55:17 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm not 100% sure if he was confessing or not. Regardless there's very little I can do without proper evidence.
neckbeardstories,32c8vk,Anaseb,5,Mon Apr 13 15:01:18 2015 UTC,"You could try to get him to email you more details about his ""dark past."" Once he writes it down for you,the only logical thing for you to do is accept it at face value. Let him explain to the police that he was ""just kidding.""  Or you could just make a statement to the police that ""this is what he said to me and now I'm scared that he's going to hurt me. I don't care if he's telling the truth or not, I am in fear for my safety. I'm worried that he'll deny he ever said it, which is why I wrote down my recollection of events as soon as I realized how seriously bad the situation is. Even if he denies having said this, I am still afraid of him and worried what he might do to me when I say that I don't want to see him any more."""
neckbeardstories,32c8vk,rezamamed,3,Mon Apr 13 16:14:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and you know what? You wouldn't be able to be rid of him even if you changed colleges, he knows where you live, where your friends live, and is a fucking stalker. Telling him to shove it can make a very unstable person like that react without emotion, and still feel nothing. Again, I say this as someone with an injury (got help for it, so no worries about that) You know what would happen when I felt like someone was being harsh? I couldn't see what I did wrong even if they told me, I'd get very defensive, and could seriously hurt someone and not feel bad about it at all. Thank God I'm not that way anymore! But it just goes to show how dangerous something so small like a threat or scolding can really affect a person into over reacting and becoming dangerous. My advice is to be nice to him, but very slowly cut off contact in a way he wouldn't see right away. Hopefully by the time you finish college, he won't be as affected if you cut contact or will have moved on to another person. Please be safe, this could go south so very easily."

neckbeardstories,32c8vk,JamJarre,2,Mon Apr 13 11:31:44 2015 UTC,"Deep Web just refers to websites not indexed by popular search engines.  Most of the deep web is fairly innocent. Things like library databases and government sites. Really anything protected by a password.  However, the deep web that most neckbeards talk about when they say ""deep web"" are the websites only available by using tor. (This is usually called the dark web) Since they are not stored on a single server, and tor provides a whole bunch of anonymity, this is where the most horrible content gets posted. Things like illegal drug trading, traffikking, hacking and child porn. (All of it is paid with bitcoins).  On the flipside, weapons and porn seem to make up not that much of the dark web. A bigger use is for the dark web is for political dissidents and whistleblowers (things like wikileaks). Without the dark web, we would know much less about our governments, and the arab spring would have been impossible. So it really is a mixed bag."

neckbeardstories,32c8vk,TheRealSpoder,7,Tue Apr 14 08:18:54 2015 UTC,"The whole deal with neckbeardness. They have trouble telling the difference between fantasy and reality. They create narratives in their head about how certain things should play out, like making up feelings they want their m'lady to have for them and then getting upset when the feelings aren't real. This guy already threw a fit when she said she only wanted to be friends.   Other examples are when they model their fashion off of fantasy or anime and believe they are the epitome of high fashion (trench coat and a fedora with dirty clothes), or they do something creepy thing that it is the most romantic gesture in their mind(stalking).   I agree most normal people can tell the difference between fantasy and rape but is it normal to work an interest in child porn and rape fantasy into everyday conversation?"

The fuck? Who does that?  It's one thing if you were being deliberately mean to NM but you haven't been, and you've got zero obligation to help someone like that get more socialised! If he wants it badly enough he'll do it on his own, but believe me - and I know from experience - you can't become the magnet for all the social misfits and strays because it'll be horrible for you. Let NM do whatever he wants - a grown up sees how their actions impact on other people and, if that impact is negative, they change their behaviour. A grown up doesn't need a mother to tell him what to do and how to behave.  Keep writing! Your stories are excellent and you're above all that hate mail crap!"

neckbeardstories,329qf8,SecondHandToy,2,Sat Apr 11 22:54:36 2015 UTC,"I am late commenting on your story but I have to say, your ex-roommate reminded me somewhat of the one nasty one I had in college.  I was the enthusiastic anime fan in this case but have always been cognizant to not be overbearing about it.  In fact, I only ever felt comfortable enough to watch anime in the room once with her in it (sadly fairly early into the year).  Once was enough though to brand me ""weird.""  I too made the mistake of reading her livejournal (yeah, I'm old) where she was spewing crap about how miserable she was because of me.    Online she said so many hurtful things, like how she ""never saw me shower"" (I had 8am classes & she never woke up before 10am--of course she never saw me take my daily shower!), how weird I made her feel when my Mom visited our dorm once and I allowed her to change her shirt in our room, and clearly never got over my weird cartoon watching.  It made me furious because if she was saying those things online, I wondered what she was saying to other girls on our floor! Furthermore, I had gone out of my way to be so accommodating: I was very friendly, made my bed every day, did my laundry diligently, kept my side of the room spotless, and never tried to talk to her about anything ""geeky.""  I really tried not to be what I knew people perceived nerds--especially otaku--were like: dirty, obnoxious and introverted. I too spent a lot of time either in the library or with my friends because of how she made me feel.  As for my woes, I put up with her snoring, waking up to seeing her stretch-mark covered tramp stamp hanging out of her PJ bottoms daily, her snarky attitude and of course the time she snuck a boy in for sex and I had to just sleep on the other side of the room silently ignoring it.  She & I just never clicked; I guess I just wasn't the type of cool, similarly-minded girl she was hoping to room with when she went to college.  At least the LJ discovery empowered me to start looking for a new roommate so she only had to put up with me for half of one year.  I had better experiences after that.  I have to say though, after reading your story, I think you had it much worse!  I thank God I never roomed with a legbeard!!"

neckbeardstories,3273ns,ejmac,5,Sat Apr 11 03:42:27 2015 UTC,"The only way out of of it is for him to catch on that he's being creepy and weird.  There is nothing you can do for him.  You could probably sit him down and discuss his pervy behaviour and his lack of hygiene.  Frame it as the reason you've stepped back from the friendship, as it was causing you some discomfort.  The key is to do this in person.  Anyone can be a keyboard hero.  It means so much more in person.  If he truly is a friend, and you are/were his best friend as he claims, he should take it as nothing but coming from a place of support and love.  However, if he just saw you as a companion that would blindly follow and ""agree"" with him, which appears to be a pretty stock NB trait on this sub, he may get upset, passive-aggressive and cut you out of his life altogether.  Only for him to repeat the cycle of woe on some unsuspecting person at college/his job.  It seems like that may not really be that bothersome to you, as you said the communication is dwindling.    It took me until 24 years old to realize I was one and did work to change it.  If he is just starting college, he's probably 19-20, as your hinting provides.  There is ample time to turn it around.  In fact this is the best time to take action and try and help him.  College is a time of growth, mentally, physically, and in character.  Show him the ""way of the Jedi"" (to keep you Star Wars analogy going) and hopefully it takes hold.  If not, he's gone full Anakin to Vader on you and likely nothing will snap him out of it now.  Good luck."
neckbeardstories,3273ns,ChrisTOEfert,4,Sat Apr 11 13:08:40 2015 UTC,"There have been quite a few times I hinted that he'd been in the wrong for quite a few small snaggles earlier on but I've never been one for conflict so I'd back off. He comes from an only child, single doting mother background. I don't think he had strong paternal figures aside from those he's seen in anime. (I might be stretching with this observation.)  I wish I could help but there's an issue of distance and well apathy on both of our ends. I'm kind of done with him at this point after piecing it together (and because it totally wasn't cool of him to heckle my other friend like that.) He's not one to change either. I think he's done with that part of life: changing. He's still the same guy I had a fallout with 2 years ago from what I've seen and heard (possibly worse.)"

neckbeardstories,31y6zx,Retiarius,5,Thu Apr 9 14:57:31 2015 UTC,"Not really. You're talking about  a crowd who live and breath fantasy worlds, playing D&D and video games, where their characters wield swords and staffs and the like - and it's also part of the Japanese obsession they have - they think they're samurai, and have very deep feelings about things like the Art Of War, Bushido, Chivalry, etc. They just want the cool part, the weapons, without putting any work into the engine that will drive them, their bodies.  That's how you get this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_oTUVtUqcM  In other words, they're living in a childish bubble, and they're trying to act out their playtime obsessions.

It seems like that obsessive, detail-oriented beardiness makes practice a lot less boring for them because they want to get everything exactly perfect, and you also kinda want fighters (when fighting!) to be assholes who really hate losing.

A whole lot of neckbeards fit that bill.  Some of those neckbeards like pretending that they're strong and tough and know a lot about fighting, especially with equalizers because of the inadequacy complex, and it's even safer for them if they aim their mad fighting skillz against someone who's seen as more helpless than themselves.  Yes, neckbeards who want to beat people up and especially try to hurt, harass, stalk and assault girls are potential rapists.

And the player is open to do whatever he wants to do - whether it is being an asshole or a saint (it tends to be swing heavily to either option, with few grey areas)  The games do have a pretty strong 'Hero saves the realm' trope going for it as well.

Look at this way: With art, you have to say something along the lines of, ""I'm a Post-Modernist and you're a Romanticist. Debate me!"" The antagonism or rivalry is muddled by the fact that art has many facets and movements with different historical contexts, and there aren't very many schools of thought that are in direct conflict with one another (at least, not in an ideological sense).  With politics, you can easily say, ""I'm a Marxist and you're a conservative. Debate me!"" The difference between ideologies is easily identifiable and immediate."

I used to be really beta and uncomfortable with it, but now I'm very dominant- I suggest being very obvious and not sugar-coating it if one is stalking you. Tell them to fuck off, and that you are in no way shape or form interested in them."
neckbeardstories,31upht,katyne,12,Wed Apr 8 12:35:00 2015 UTC,I wouldn't recommend antagonizing them though. Some of them are budding psychopaths and have very skewed perception of right vs wrong. It's a scary thing when a grown-up has emotional development of a three year old.

For example, one I met at work a few years ago and just seemed like a friendly person (granted we only talked about work stuff at work) and he drove me home a couple of times before I got my license because I usually had to wait a while for the bus. Him being interested in me was incredibly sudden and really intense and scary. I worked with him so coulen't avoid him and he knew where I lived from dropping me off. Turned him down as best I could, but part of me was scarred of what he could do :/ Luckily they gave me a work transfer, so I got away."

neckbeardstories,31upht,mladybot,2,Wed Apr 8 21:15:07 2015 UTC,"I used to be a neckbeard. I can tell you straight-up that I never meant to be dominating or scary, but I did come off as it and it really upset me. This was back in high school and freshman year in college. I was (incorrectly) informed that ""nice guys"" finish last and I took that to heart a little too much.  I always wish I could go back in time and apologize, and even now all these years later, I still feel like I need to apologize to everyone who runs in with a neckbeard. However, I will say that not all neckbeards are psychopathic rapists.... but if any warning signs are given, don't hesitate to find a populated location and cut them off. Not all neckbeards are rapists, but some neckbeards CAN be rapists... just like any other messed up person.  I'm terribly sorry to those of you who had to deal with that kind of stuff. Nobody should."

Point out that the comments are supportive, maybe even overly so, maybe even a bit more about the commenters making themselves feel good than necessarily supporting OP, also fine. Your prerogative, and again I probably agree with you, or definitely lean towards you  But OP has said a bunch of times that he's a guy. He identifies as male, because he's a male. Man or boy, dunno, dunno the age. But male. As he is the captain of his own soul, it is his decision which gender he is.  So call him ""bro"" as you belittle and patronise him, you bollix.

neckbeardstories,31tadd,deep1986,-3,Sat May 9 15:42:20 2015 UTC,"Sorry I like to think ""biologically"" as long as the body is male, it is a male.  It means no offense."
neckbeardstories,31tadd,thisguyehwhataledge,3,Sun Apr 12 19:13:21 2015 UTC,"Well lots of people will take offense to that attitude. So you might not mean offense, but you are causing it.  Secondly, to some degree the biological body is relevant. But if someone has gone through surgery to make their body their chosen sex, then your definition still applies. I presume what you mean by this is it is only the original body that is relevant. Well, that's wrong.  You can either be kind or hateful. It is kind to treat others with respect and allow them to choose their own paths, independent of what you think. It is hateful to force everyone to conform to how you view the world, because you are so insecure you cannot accept differences to yourself.  It is up to you who you want to be.   But being hateful and then saying ""no offense"" doesn't make you kind."
neckbeardstories,31qj1i,Alecsaustria,15,Tue Apr 7 11:21:36 2015 UTC,"Okay.  I'm kind of with the guy below me on this, this story is very inconsistent and doesn't really exhibit a neckbeard per se.  First you're able to tell him off, but then you're paralyzed by the situation.  I get it, it was unwanted sexual attention, but if you could do it before, surely within a minute or two you could say it again, no?  Potter just seems like a really mean guy.  He has the can of Dew and neckbeard looks, but I mean, that could totally be a fabrication on your part.  We don't know the guy.  The general neckbeard ""checklist"", apart from the physical characteristics include: NiceGuy syndrome, superiority complex, euphoria, perceived superior intellect, and obliviousness to anything but their focus.  So while he may be dirty and gross and be a slave to the Dew...that's all I really see here.    Sure, he made a sexual comment, and yeah his non-virgin comment isn't super nice and tactful, it doesn't really make him a neckbeard in my eyes.  Just some mean, horny bully.  But I'll hold off on full judgement until your next story."

Like, overweight guy smells like Mountain Dew, is a hardcore atheist, and is super regressive about his views on women? That's pretty classic neckbeard from what I can tell. Granted, inconsistent as to how ""beta"" the protagonist is, but this guy shows some pretty telltale signs of neckbeardiness. I say keep it.  Side note, why laugh at the introduction? Trans people do exist, and it's important to mention if (like op says it will) it shows up later in the story."

neckbeardstories,31htem,DorkKnightofGotham,13,Fri Apr 17 05:00:41 2015 UTC,"This scenario, and WK's opinion on sex reminds me of someone that used to attend the same philosophy course as me. This was a course in theory of argumentation. Imagine the fun times that occured when this course looked at the abortion debate (I was the TA too >_<). He had a super old-fashioned view on sex and marriage: after marriage you are supposed to consummate it. In other words, sex and having a kid is obligatory after marriage, hence, clearly abortion is wrong. (On the flip side: sex before marriage is of course, a no-no) This was more or less yelled across the classroom as a climax after he slowly got more and more frustrated about the direction the lecture was going, and that his previous (also poorly argued for) points was all but ignored.  Other fun things about him: his default go-to conversation topics were either politics, religion or similar. Where he always had some radical crazy viewpoint that he'd try out on the other party, and ultimately try to 'win the argument' that he himself started. Getting quite annoyed if he couldn't persuade the other person, or if there was any attempt to shut down the obnoxious topic."

Maybe it's the same underlying problem: Biology simply doesn't support WK's and fringe believers' views on life and how to lead it, and so they dismiss it. WK clearly demonstrates that he doesn't know jack about biology (""purity"" wtf) and because his views are much more important than actually knowing how the world works he concludes that biology isn't actual science. And that's where he (and most OHWHATANATHEISTIAM neckbeards) and funDIEs (DEEERRRRHH) meet.

Hell no I can't easily flirt with pretty girls, at this stage of my life it was all I cared about though and knowing it was a skill I tried to hone it 24/7. The same went for martial arts. This attitude was actually really common at my school, which is surprising, because someone like you would likely assume that we were all naturally smart... Kidding, we all got there with work ethic and MAYBE some good genetics. Which pays off into other things, thus why we had more than 12 national top threes in sports, from cross country to tennis, as well as a few international champions of something or rather and dozens of state level players in basketball, volleyball, tennis, football, etc.  FYI you had to pass a SB test to get in, the average was never revealed, but from what I could tell (from asking) 130 would be a good guess."

They were so concern with teaching us that drugs aren't okay that they never taught us that rape is horrible!  Sorry, pardon my ramble.

Each cabin has its own fire pit and they get burgers or hotdogs or whatever to cook over it. Now, the counselors and campers who have caught on, myself included, love telling the younger/more naive campers to go find the fabled Left Handed Smoke Shifter. I fell prey to this at one point as well. We've been told to stop doing it but it happens every so often. I love hearing stories about people who think they're hot shit going hiking and just having the worst time. Sweet, sweet Schadenfreude.  Sam finally got what was coming to him, especially after a comment like that. I only wish that he found the spaghetti and Meatballs to be gross. That would have made this so much better.

We'd walk maybe 500 meters at a normal pace, and Sam would need to stop. It drove everyone nuts.   You have to understand the neckbeard/niceguy™ mindset. Women aren't people. We're just props and supporting characters in their story. A ""no"" isn't really a no to them, it means ""Go on an imaginary quest to convince me""."

Had it been us (my wife and I) when we were y'alls age, some strange ghetto-redneck hybrid - a result of growing up in an urbanized area of the Deep South - would've emerged and beat the living daylights outta him.

Look at that sentence outside of the rest of the text. What if this was someone you knew, like your brother? Dad? Does anybody else see the common humanity we share with him, even though he's an incredibly abrasive and unpleasant person? He's just as human as we are, even if he is so unpleasant.  Sure, he's an asshat. But in between all of the laughing at him that you guys do -Myself included, don't get me wrong-, would you care to remember that he's a person too?

You are in charge of your own happiness, but you are also responsible for others emotional well being. The fact that we so often have immensely self centered lives means that we overlook how much we affect others. It is totally OK, normal, and not a problem at all to react strongly to how others have treated you. It is definitely up to others to work to fix their behavior, and it is totally okay to call people on their shit and let them know how it makes you feel.    The advice ""happiness comes from within"" and others like it is hollow, unrealistic, and ultimately problematic. Happiness is a mixture of intrinsic and extrinsic things, and anyone who says otherwise is foolish."

A lightsaber could cut through tanks because it is more advanced and specialized, but you get more bang for your buck firing bullets that move too fast for a sword-wielder to block successfully. Ask your friend if he can go about 1126 feet per second about the speed of sound, and then ask for a demonstration. Modern guns can fore bullets that go twice the speed of sound, so about 2252 feet per second. I just want to see a weeboo try to run at that speed."

Hopefully he doesn't try to imitate his big brother or anything.  My not-exactly-serious advice would be to wear swag for awhile.

A lot of them feel more like OP is seeking validation than interesting stories. I guess because a lot of these stories are written by teenagers maybe?
neckbeardstories,300cxn,kermi42,12,Mon Mar 23 15:00:46 2015 UTC,"That's also very true.  Some stories will mention the promiscuous sex lives of the narrator when it's completely pointless.  All I can think is good for you, but why are you telling me"
neckbeardstories,300cxn,sammccoll,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:47:01 2015 UTC,"In some stories it's been relevant because it's something the antagonist will use to attack our humble narrator.

neckbeardstories,300cxn,MissLizzyBennet,4,Thu Apr 2 05:32:53 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean, but far too often it's mentioned with no real purpose.   There was a long running 'real' series where the OP rarely failed to mention her sex habits when the story contained nothing that related."

neckbeardstories,300cxn,modern-funk,11,Thu Mar 26 23:11:00 2015 UTC,"Hey, I've been reading this sub for a bit now too, and while a couple of people seem border line neckbeardy themselves, being a nerd, smoking, and drinking doesn't make you a bad person or a neck beard.  These traits are actually pretty normal, smoking and drinking, while not great (or even good for you) is their choice. They're not hurting anyone else by doing these very common practices. And being a nerd? We're all nerds about something. Superhero movies are the top movies of the summer, video games are a huge industry that most people take part in, and anime as a whole is so diverse my 80 year old grandmother who doesn't like animation enjoys a couple of anime movies.   What a lot of these writers don't have that neckbeards do is an extreme sense of entitlement. They don't harass people who they feel a right to be with, and generally just want the people they're writing about to leave them along or stop invading their privacy (or take a shower).   So no, I don't think most of these writers are bad people or neckbeards themselves. But that's just my opinion."

neckbeardstories,300cxn,xbrightcursivex,5,Wed Mar 25 18:59:14 2015 UTC,"First off, I really don't get what you are trying to say with your middle paragraph, could you elaborate?  I don't generally find the protagonists more insufferable than the (supposed) neckbeards.  I think some of what you find annoying might be up to the general story telling approach people conform to. People tend to play into stereotypes and certain tropes (for instance, the constant 'nasal assault' that goes on when neckbeards are near). Also, in writing those stereotypes, the writers tend to overexagerate and use quite picturesque descriptions.   I also think that sometimes people make themselves into a foil for the neckbeard to make it clearer how bad the neckbeard is. Perhaps this is what you find insufferable?"
neckbeardstories,300cxn,IonComet,4,Mon Mar 23 14:28:36 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of the foil term before, that's very interesting.

neckbeardstories,300cxn,mladybot,4,Mon Mar 23 15:35:06 2015 UTC,"I sometimes do. For me it's the rather young age of the supposed neck beard the writers write about. Many of stories seem to be centered around high school and even middle school. I don't think a neck beard can exist at such an early stage. They're still developing their personalities and social skills so it's unfair. For me a neck beard is someone post undergrad - an adult.  At the same time I've read stories where the writer themselves is acting like a neck beard. There was a story awhile back about how the writer broke up with some guy. Apparently he started spreading rumors about her in this subreddit. In the end it ended up being a former friend who was speeding the rumors. Anyways, the whole time she was writing about their love of MLP and how they first met at an MLP convention. I mean...she's an adult who plays with MLP dolls and dated a guy who plays with MLP dolls. That's both cringey and borderline neck beard behavior.  Of course everyone up voted her /r/upvotedbecausegirl"

Yeah, unless you don't mind having your inbox perpetually flooded with creep-messages by a guy who thinks he has sole privilege to use the word ""no"" and whose dictionary doesn't contain the phrase ""move the fuck on"", I think it might be a good idea to have a spare alt. Good grief, how long has it been since he started?  I think if he spent, like, even 1/10th of the time he seems to be taking towards flooding you with texts and PMs to improving himself, he'd be in a lot better place than he is now.

That was when I decided to start only posting personal stuff from this username. This is my alt. So, I'm hoping he doesn't find me here. The thing is, I know which subs he lurks in, and none of them are places I post things. So for him to have that information means he purposefully looked me up.   He needs to move on. I looked at his Okc profile after I was utterly repulsed at my inbox, and it's pretty much him whining about not wanting to waste his time and how he's tired of putting energy into having his heart broken... So, he still hasn't gotten a clue.   I'm sorry, he's clearly in need of some kind of intervention. I don't know what though. And all I can think of doing is blocking him and moving on. He doesn't have my address (my old one or my new one), he doesn't have my number (I blocked his anyway), he can't get me on fb (blocked), and I deleted my Okc profile months ago.

I know he doesn't lurk in any of the same subs I do. The comment he made about naming my kid was on a post I made to /r/AskReddit. He had to have looked me up to find that, since the mods deleted it before he commented. The fact that he's sending me direct messages, rather than just well directed comments, show me that he's actively looking for me.   He mostly sticks to subs that have to do with video games and /r/gonewild. I don't think he'd appear here, since I'm quite sure he has no idea he's a Neckbeard.

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.  I don’t give a fuck who you are or where you live. You can count on me to be there to bring your fucking life to a hellish end. I’ll put you in so much fucking pain that it’ll make Jesus being nailed to a cross in the desert look like a fucking back massage on a tropical island. I don’t give a fuck how many reps you have or how tough you are IRL, how well you can fight, or how many fucking guns you own to protect yourself. I’ll fucking show up at your house when you aren’t home. I’ll turn all the lights on in your house, leave all the water running, open your fridge door and not close it, and turn your gas stove burners on and let them waste gas. You’re going to start stressing the fuck out, your blood pressure will triple, and you’ll have a fucking heart attack. You’ll go to the hospital for a heart operation, and the last thing you’ll see when you’re being put under in the operating room is me hovering above you, dressed like a doctor. When you wake up after being operated on, wondering what ticking time bomb is in your chest waiting to go off. You’ll recover fully from your heart surgery. And when you walk out the front door of the hospital to go home I’ll run you over with my fucking car out of no where and kill you. I just want you to know how easily I could fucking destroy your pathetic excuse of a life, but how I’d rather go to a great fucking length to make sure your last remaining days are spent in a living, breathing fucking hell. It’s too late to save yourself, but don’t bother committing suicide either… I’ll fucking resuscitate you and kill you again myself you bitch-faced phaggot. Welcome to hell, population: you."

It's a fine line to walk, but you can hold to both the letter and the spirit of the Law.   I actually spent a year as troop chaplain. Every week, closing prayer from a different religion.

Dale, 530 U.S. 640 (2000), was a case of the Supreme Court of the United States decided on June 28, 2000, that held that the constitutional right to freedom of association allows a private organization like the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) to exclude a person from membership when ""the presence of that person affects in a significant way the group's ability to advocate public or private viewpoints.""  In a five to four decision, the Supreme Court ruled that opposition to homosexuality is part of BSA's ""expressive message"" and that allowing homosexuals as adult leaders would interfere with that message.  It reversed a decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court that had determined that New Jersey's public accommodations law required the BSA to readmit assistant Scoutmaster James Dale, who had made his homosexuality public and whom the BSA had expelled from the organization.

One of the reasons that the BSA has been so static on their religious policies is because the LDS and Catholic church are such a huge chunk of the membership.  The annoying thing about the policy change for gay scouts is that all it did was make the appearance of a change, to get their corporate sponsors back on board. On paper, you're no longer required to be kicked out for being gay, it's just left up to your chartered organization. Of course, if your charter isn't religious, or is a more forward-thinking sect, you probably would have been fine to begin with. But are you a gay mormon? Gay baptist? Gay in a deep red state? Fuck you! Sincerely, the BSA.   Why a non-sexual-in-any-way organization concerns itself with your sexual preference is far beyond me."

Ah yes, that's the thing I was thinking of. You wouldn't think it'd be the Mormons, since whenever a scandal comes up it's usually the Evangelical and Baptist talking heads that come out of the woodwork to talk about it on the news, but it makes sense financially. Both the Mormons and the Scientologists have the few member but lots of money thing going. Interestingly, Scientology has some billions of dollars in the form of land, which is pretty cool, if kind of creepy too.   GS has the word ""god"" in the Girl Scout Pledge, but I always left it out and nobody cared.   Eh, I'll complain about the Girl Scout pledge when we get E Pluribus Unum back (a vastly cooler motto).

Coke is the one that comes to mind when I think of a corporation that isn't obtrusive. Chik-Fil-A's corporate level donates to anti-gay groups, Starbucks is encouraging barristas to talk about race and privilege, Coca-Cola just makes soda. And while I'm sure they lobby about soft drink legislation (whatever that could be), they're not doing that nonsense that some bank lobbyists were in the news for a while back where congressmen and Senators were letting the lobbyists write the legislation themselves and then submitting them to vote.   My Financial Wellness badge wasn't sponsored by Bank of America or anything :)   Well, I should hope not!

In return for donating food to the swap box, you're allowed to take out however many items you put in, hence the name. Last time I was there, swap boxes were absolutely brimming with those damn larabars."

WHAT A DOUCHECANOE! thats just a low blow...trying to put the moves on her during such a tough time...wtf  For grief counseling:   the obvious be-there-cuz-friends-are-super-important. if she wants distractions, thats a fun route! go to movies, go play mini golf, go do something fun that can get her mind off it for a bit. if distraction doesnt work/isnt wanted, if she is comfortable/wants/needs to sit and talk about it and if you are comfortable listening, do so. sometimes you just need to get feelings out. listening and being able to express feelings is important. and if she is up for it, talk about fun memories of her brother.  remind her that you guys are there for her and that she isnt alone. it's scary not having anyone to express your feelings of loss to.    personally, i love the storytelling one. my family lost my uncle about half a year ago and my cousins and I have been healing by talking about our uncle (since he was the official favorite uncle as he didnt have kids of his own. he was like the oldest cousin in a way lol) while we were sad, we could be sad together! and cheer each other up by talking about the good times, as corny as that sounds.   but yeah the main thing is just talking with her, seeing what she needs specifically in the ways of grief-help, and then being there as best you can"

Don't ask ""what can I do to help"" - straight up offer to do things.  (But do give her an opportunity to say no.)  Like, after all the condolence food finally runs out but they still might not feel like cooking - ""hey can I bring your family a casserole tonight?""  Or all the condolence food is rotting cuz they can't eat it fast enough ""I'd love to clean your kitchen for you.""  Or whatever.  If you ask ""how can I help"" most people a) won't have any idea because their head's not on straight and b) won't feel comfortable asking anyway.  You're a good friend.  :)"

neckbeardstories,2zjicz,jabberdoggy,4,Thu Mar 19 06:44:48 2015 UTC,"This is great advice.  The only thing I would add is don't worry about knowing the right things to say... there are no right things to say.  Just be there for her, and take your cue from her about what she needs.  She might need to express anger. She might need a good cry. She might need a goofy distraction. And so on. She might need all this stuff at once.  And be willing to recognize if maybe things are getting to the point where maybe more professional advice should be sought.  It's not a comfortable position, and it's not easy, but just being there for her is one of the best things you can do.   Years ago, I lost someone close to me, and while I don't remember anything much specifically about what people said or did, I do remember the fact that they were there for me, you know?"

So, one thing I've been meaning to do is set up a family website as a way to record everyone and the relationships between family members, and also include a photo album of the person. And also fire up the scanner and scan in all the old photos before something happens to them (flood, fire, age, etc.).  Might be something to work on with your friend. On one hand seeing his pictures might being more grief, however at the same time, it might bring some comfort that other people remember him fondly and such and bring some closure? Or as she moves to other family members, it'll help distract her from the grief.  Hope that helps!"

Like I know when my grandma died I rejected physical contact for a really long time. Didn't know why, but I definitely felt cripplingly lonely because of it and it was almost like a self-emotional harm thing. I would say make it absolutely clear that you are there for whatever she needs you for, and that she doesn't have to ""be tough"" or be anything really. She deserves to be a little selfish right now, and if that means crying on a shoulder or taking a kickboxing course, she should. Of course, if she's deeply depressed, I would also urge caution, and keep an eye on her. Not that she would contemplate suicide or anything, but that she might stop taking care of herself, like stop eating, or physical self harm or something. If at any point she develops any worrying habits it might be necessary to tactfully suggest seeing a therapist because her emotional wounds are too big and turbulent to deal with in it's current state."

neckbeardstories,2zj3c8,kt_light,19,Thu Mar 19 00:04:22 2015 UTC,Why are all of these creeps game design majors?
neckbeardstories,2zj3c8,iDork622,16,Thu Mar 19 09:57:31 2015 UTC,"Because they think that game design is something that can be done very easily, and aren't aware of the amount of work required in even making a modestly-sized indie game. I mean, hey! I play a lot of games! I'm practically an expert already!    Also, since I listen to a lot of Bach, Handel, and Schubert in my spare time, I can totally play a violin!"

neckbeardstories,2zj3c8,CogChoir,9,Fri Mar 20 02:03:52 2015 UTC,"Hi, game programmer here :)  You see, the main issue with this field is that almost nobody knows how hard it is to make a game until they've actually done it. These people play games all the time and get the idea in their head that, because they know so much about playing games, it's only natural to move on and make them.  Of course, when they find out they can't model, draw, animate, or program, they fall back onto the last thread: coming up with ideas. They think, ""Yeah, I can't code or draw worth shit, but I've got an amazing idea for the next [insert triple-A title here]!""  This is why the companies and developers don't look at people based on their education. You can get a degree in game design for all they care, but if you don't have any tangible experience, they're not going to give a damn. You need to have a portfolio, showing what you can do, and why they should hire you instead of someone else. If all you can do is gaze starry-eyed and dream about your million dollar ideas, they won't even waste the time to send you a rejection letter."
neckbeardstories,2zj3c8,Origami84,12,Sun Mar 22 05:25:47 2015 UTC,"The only thing they know and value are videogames and comics: to find out that they suck at drawing is easy, but for programming they first have to waste a lot of (their parent's) money in college."
neckbeardstories,2zj3c8,baaabuuu,9,Thu Mar 19 15:13:28 2015 UTC,"I actually have nothing against game design majors in general, I sort of wish I could do it too, but as I understand it, programming requires you to be extremely detail oriented and patient, something I know I can't be."
neckbeardstories,2zj3c8,ThriKr33n,3,Fri Mar 20 03:34:09 2015 UTC,"Programming is just ""logical thinking"" and knowing a language.  You can derive a lot of cool stuff out of nothing.  Like if you have a move function, a object on a screen alongside a loop and a wait.  You can make a loop in which you move the object a few pixels using the loop and make it appear as if it is scrolling up and down. Even though you are telling it to move from x=1 to x=2."

But also, the college just made it so that students in our majors had priority, the teacher had no control over that, she was just a part-timer who didn't even technically have an office."

neckbeardstories,2ze3bc,foxensfancy,30,Tue Mar 17 20:35:25 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I wish I could mentor a neckbeard. There should be a ""big brother"" program.   Sometimes I wonder if neckbeards happen because nobody is there at the right time to be a mirror for them, to show them what they look like when they do their neckbeard things. I think neckbeardism is in itself a fashion statement for the clueless.   Or maybe, just maaaaaybe, neckbeardism can be traced to weird moms who praise their overweight sons for being completely unattractive, fearful of confronting empty nest syndrome?"
neckbeardstories,2ze3bc,Night_in_the_Forest,28,Tue Mar 17 22:55:10 2015 UTC,"From my experience with 'beards, I think it's a combination of two factors. For one, they lack a strong male figure to emulate. Their father is either not in the picture at all, or is a total loser. The 'beard then has to basically start from scratch when trying to figure out what ""manhood"" is all about, and they imitate what they see in porn and media.   This is where they get their warped ideas about socialization and women, especially. Being the main character and hero of their own story, they are going to get the girl. No matter what, through thick and thin, trials and tribulations, they will eventually win her heart and spirit her off into the sunset. But she isn't a person. She doesn't have thoughts or ambitions of her own; she's just a plot device, a prop for furthering his own storyline. She's not interested in other men, not truly. She might act like she is, but in the end the 'beard knows she's going to end up with him, her one true love and savior.   I can't say too much about neckbeard sex (shudder) because I've never had the misfortune to fuck a 'beard, but I do know they're firmly planted in the ""size matters"" crowd, and girls are expected to be blowjob machines. But only for them. If you get physically intimate with anyone other than the 'beard, you're a cunt whore slut bitch who's worth less than dandruff flakes.   Second, their (usually single) m'om reinforces the behavior. Whether it be through active encouragement or just passive enabling, the result is the same. Moms are awesome. They will love you no matter what. Unfortunately, some don't have the foresight or the heart to step in and tell their 'beard son when he's making an ass of himself.   Most 'beards are slightly above average intelligence, at the very least they test higher than their peers. In elementary school, this is enough to earn good marks. As you grow older, though, your scores are more reflective of the work you do rather than just how well you understand the material. Very few 'beards are actually on the genius scale. They know this, deep down, and it's why so many try to compensate with /r/iamverysmart levels of pretentiousness, to prove to everyone and to themselves that they really are just as smart as they say they are.   I had no intention of hammering out this novella that has nothing to do with the posted story. I'm sharing my findings for science."
neckbeardstories,2ze3bc,Lady_Sabre,7,Wed Mar 18 02:14:49 2015 UTC,"I can confirm pretty much all of that, being an ex-beard. Only thing that saved me was that my parents aren't shit, so I shed the beard eventually.  But yeah, absolutely agree with all of that. I can safely say that I am NOT a genius, but during the 'beard stage I tried my absolute damnedest to sound like one. The other thing about ""Hero of their own story"" sounds eerily similar to my mindset during that period, too."

An HR department would filter these types out quickly, seeing a lack of any decent portfolio samples, or probably a condescending attitude in the phone interview if they even get that far. If by chance they were able to weasel their way in, they tend not to survive long since studios run very tight schedules and lack of skill or ability to adapt and learn will get them ousted quickly.  You'll probably encounter them more often in the indie scene since the bar of entry is much lower there (i.e. anyone with Unity/UDK/Flash can start making something). And a lack of oversight from a higher up, which can be a good (creativity freedom!) and bad thing  (keeping someone accountable for their actions).  I know a neckbeard that always brags about how smart he was in school and he was top of the class and how he can program better than me. Yet I'm the one that modded a game and got hired as a result of my work (in fact, they called me first!). Of course, in my interactions with the guy, it's pretty obvious he's very, very jealous of my accomplishments, but whenever I ask him what he's done lately, it's always excuses after excuses for why he hasn't done anything. That's probably the most telling for types like him, they want to be rewarded for merely being, not for what they've actually done.  So, one can update a proverb for the information age: ""Those that can, do. Those that can't, whine and bitch about it on social media.""   and i have to ask, how did you get literal scars??   Combination of genetics (yay high cholesterol) + crunch for several months + company supplied greasy crunch food (yay pizza) = gallstones -> gallbladder trying to kill me -> hospitalized -> turns out said gallbladder was so full of stones that they couldn't use the non-invasive laporoscopic method so I had to be cut open the traditional way.  The best fun was one day when I was feeling OK (before the hospitalization), and when walking into the studio, I had a (white) coworker comment ""Wow, you're so YELLOW!"" - I'm Asian but was also suffering from jaundice from a blocked bile duct from a 1cm gallstone trying to kill me. I joked ""I'm going to HR to complain that you're RACIST!"" but it was all in jest."

neckbeardstories,2z3via,SavantButDeadly,15,Sun Mar 15 08:27:16 2015 UTC,"Topic: I think most neckbeards tend to be too oblivious to their own neckbeardiness that the jokes would fly right over their heads (e.g. ""HA. Frederick wears a fedora. REAL men wear TRILLBYS, like m'self."").  As long as you get the humor right, you should be fine. You don't want your ""hero"" to be borderline neckie. You want him sweating mountain dew so badly that even if a real neckbeard picked it up, he could laugh at how ridiculous it is.  Money: If you're still afraid of your main demographic shunning the game, make it free to play. A free game is going to attract more people (like myself) who don't typically play VN's, but are willing to give it a shot simply because ""Eh, it's free. What do I have to lose?"" and think that it sounds damn funny.  You can always throw in a donation button. Suggest a buck or two if people enjoyed the game and would like to see more in future, and maybe bribe them with a little bonus like developer notes or unused art if they do."
neckbeardstories,2z3via,NuclearSquiddy,5,Sun Mar 15 09:35:56 2015 UTC,"Solid advice. :)  Making the game funny without being too silly will be a challenge, for sure. I'm aiming for somewhere between ""Funny because it's true"" and funny because the protagonist is a caricature of a stereotypical neckbeard.  Yeah, since Steam doesn't publish any sales numbers, it's hard to judge if enough people in western countries buy VNs. Donation driven is something I hadn't considered, but yeah, why not? :) Making it episodal like Telltales The Walking Dead and make the first episode free could also be an idea."
neckbeardstories,2z3via,NuclearSquiddy,4,Sun Mar 15 09:52:39 2015 UTC,"Another possibility: Once you hit so many donations, the next chapter is released for free to other players.  Your choice, of course. It's your time and effort put into this, and you don't have to work for free if you don't want to. Good luck!"
neckbeardstories,2z3via,LordQill,2,Sun Mar 15 10:06:45 2015 UTC,"I think in terms of the comedy, you'll really need to exaggerate EVERYTHING, like /u/NuclearSquiddy said. One of the most important elements to insure comedy will be character design and animation, the more ridiculously odd/neckbeardy the animation and character design is, the funnier we'll find the dialogue. Oh, btw, remember to keep the dialogue pretty short and sweet, some comedy games write full 15 minute scenes that take place during gameplay. Try and limit it to like, 30 sec for a funny conversation.  Maybe I'm wrong, but that's just my two cents :)  Good luck!"
neckbeardstories,2z3via,Jefrejtor,9,Wed Mar 18 05:19:17 2015 UTC,"As long as you don't overdo the idea. It'd be easy to base the whole thing on the neckbeard stereotype, put him in a few social situations, and call it a day. Try exploring the various areas of neckbeardhood: it's not just the social issues, it's the lack of self-awareness, laziness, entitlement, and the lack of experience coming from that all.  Also notice how neckbeards have a point of view very different than a normal person's. Things they think of as positive and gratifying are perceived differently from the outside. Maybe employ a second, ""normal"", protagonist? The differences could be really stark, like when playing the neckbeard, you're committing various acts of valour and engage foes in heated debates, but the ""normal"" character sees the neckbeard as childish and senseless. The visuals could change too, like neckbeard seeing himself as a stout man with a glorious beard, while the other character sees him as an overweight, pitifully hairy man-child.   Something like a ""morality meter"" could be added, too. The character is on a sliding scale, one end is full-on wizardmode, the other is the ascension to a functioning human. The trick would be for the players to not choose the ""right"" answers-saving a girl that's being harassed could move you closer towards being a neckbeard, because the situation was sinister only in your eyes, and you charged in, armour shining, without knowing anything, and made a fool out of yourself.  Come to think of it, if you're feeling up to the task, and don't want your game to be seen as gimmicky, don't make it about neckbeards. Make it about young men transitioning into adulthood, because neckbeardness is an inescapable part of that. Feel free to make it as light-hearted as you want to, but don't shy away from the actual social issue. If you put thought into it, your game will make waves in the proverbial lake that is the internet, and won't be discarded as a one-trick pony.  That's just my ideas. Whatever approach you may choose, good luck to you.  EDIT: Oh, also consider posting this to /r/justneckbeardthings, and check out this webcomic as an inspiration."
neckbeardstories,2z3via,Jefrejtor,3,Sun Mar 15 15:50:28 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks! You've given me a lot of things to think about.  You're completely right about his point of view and I plan to do something like that. I don't think there is a need for a second character. If we take, for example, Patrick Bateman from American Psycho, we simply saw everything from his point of view, and realized how twisted his world view was. There was no need for an outsider to point it out.  The morality meter is an interesting concept! Maybe something where doing the right/moral thing always takes you further from the girl, or at least it seems that way. Like choosing not to stalk her facebook page means that you miss out on an opportunity to ""randomly"" bump into her at the yoga class you ""just happened"" to take. So either you sacrifice your chances with the girl or you sacrifice your... normalness.  I think to some degree it will have to be a bit gimmicky and over-the-top or else it could easily turn into a sad story about a young man who has troubles in life. But yes, I understand what you mean, and can assure you that if the game happens, it wouldn't be an American sitcom style barrage of jokes and gags."

neckbeardstories,2z0n63,autowikibot,2,Sat Mar 14 21:47:13 2015 UTC,"John Ruskin:       John Ruskin (8 February 1819 – 20 January 1900) was the leading English art critic of the Victorian era, also an art patron, draughtsman, watercolourist, a prominent social thinker and philanthropist. He wrote on subjects ranging from geology to architecture, myth to ornithology, literature to education, and botany to political economy. His writing styles and literary forms were equally varied. Ruskin penned essays and treatises, poetry and lectures, travel guides and manuals, letters and even a fairy tale. The elaborate style that characterised his earliest writing on art was later superseded by a preference for plainer language designed to communicate his ideas more effectively. In all of his writing, he emphasised the connections between nature, art and society. He also made detailed sketches and paintings of rocks, plants, birds, landscapes, and architectural structures and ornamentation.

neckbeardstories,2z0n63,fareven,2,Sat Mar 14 22:03:09 2015 UTC,I think one of the only things preventing such a Victorian gentleman from going full neckbeard was that he lived in a society that didn't insulate him much (if at all) from the consequences of his own failures.

Individually, these traits a neckbeard do not make; the smug sense of self-superiority, the atheism, the sense of entitlement, the awkwardness, the lack of personal hygiene or social skills... when not formed up into the Voltron of cringe known as neckbeardism, only serve to make the individual in question a shitty person.  It's like arguing what makes a stew, a ""stew"". Some say it's the meat. Others say it's the broth. Still some argue it's the veggies involved. They're all wrong - when used together they create a stew. On its own, the meat could be served over rice or noodles, or used for curry, stir-fry, or kebabs, for example. The broth could be used to deglaze the cooking surface & produce a sauce or gravy. The veggies could, if nothing else, be served on the side. Even then, you'd have the same components but a completely different dish. It's the way they mesh together that creates a stew.  It's the same with neckbeards. You can combine all the ""ingredients"" and get a shitty person, but it takes something else to animate these jowly, greasy, avatars of awkward."

The guy had, and still has, a full on neck beard. Graphic T, nerdy, wears fedoras, etc. However, I can't think of a time that he hasn't had a steady girlfriend. I've never heard him speak poorly of a woman in general. In fact, I'd put him down as one of the nicest people I've ever met.   But to reinforce your point, if he had any of those personality traits, he would be the Ghandi of the neckbeards."

From what I've read, $2.99 is the price sweet spot, because below that your cut drops from 70% to 35%. The thing is, you don't have much to lose, except a little time. If I were you, I'd budget a fixed time for putting together a ""part 1"" of a reasonable size, put it out there, and see how it does. If nobody buys it, at least you won't waste any time editing the rest. And you're probably not the type to be deeply wounded and embittered if it does turn out that nobody buys it.

John Lyndon pointed out that it was not, and Alex Cox alleged that Lyndon had signed off on the film, but had been drunk at the time so it was doubtful he would remember.

Assuming her accounts are true, he does sound like the kind of person who can perform the kind of mental gymnastics to convince himself that the sabre incident was someone else's fault.   There are shark lawyers out there who make their living by proving people with money right.   Even if he does not win the case, it would still mean hassle and shit sticking to her.   I am not saying that will happen for sure. It's not a worry d at all if sur Sam has barely two pennies to rub together, or more likely, mummy won't give him money to pay a libel lawyer.   The best thing for her to do though is make sure its not an option for him. Perhaps she could ask the publisher she approaches how they handle such situations.

That aside, the main problem is that ""neckbeards"" are a concept really only known in this generation that a majority of Redditors are part of (Millennials, I think it's called?). So just publishing these stories wouldn't work. You would have to make some book with you or a similar figure as the main character and Ser Sam as the antagonist or something.

It got to the point where he would only leave his room to go to the same diner every day to eat the same thing or, to step outside a to smoke his cigarettes even though he had emphysema.

neckbeardstories,2ycsyq,FinnSven,5,Mon Mar 9 12:39:42 2015 UTC,"My stepson is Aspergers, and while he seems social and happy, he has no sense of others in many regards.  I have to guide him in appropriateness a hell of a lot.  My brother in law also is on the spectrum, and here he was classifed as disabled so has been given a disability allowance for life.  Unfortunately this prevented him from finding a job, and now he just plays video games, gets drunk, goes fishing and really has no sense of responsibility.  I am sure he would have been a lot more responsible and had a lot more going on in his life had he worked. It would also have helped him relating to others as he really does not understand when I have to explain to him things relating to financial responsibility and why he can't get credit cards to blow on drinking.    It often can be the case with families not really accepting that a child has a condition like this.  Sometimes they don't really know what to look for, sometimes they put it down to teenage moodiness and figure that they will grow out of it, sometimes they just point blank go into denial.   Of course, I am just going on what you have described, and I am not a professional, so I could very easily be wrong.  Maybe you could gently suggest to your B/F that they speak to an educational psychologist.   There is the chance that he does not have a condition, but simply knowing that people are that concerned about his behaviour they think he is autistic, might spring him into sorting his life out."

He's probably developed his holier-than-thou attitude and social isolation as a defense mechanism, honestly. I fell into the same trap of living at home thanks to OCD-Germaphobia issues, but it was soon after that I began to realize how wrong my psychology was. I think he really just needs some help to overcome his socially stunted and isolated past. He probably hates his lifestyle inside but doesn't want to let it show due to all that pride. He probably also is afraid of going out and getting a job, education, etc. because he's scared of dealing with his social and mental issues. It sure would help if he saw someone try to connect with him with compassion and without judgement. Would go a long way to solving the superiority complex, although I'm still trying to stop thinking in those patterns. But this is all from my perspective because he and I have only deviated slightly in history at this point. I'm 18. Scares me to hear that some people live this way until they're 20.

(And a couple of Finnish and Norwegian)    When I ask them why they agreed to alone time in the first place, they always say;  ""But he said he just wanted to be friends. He said he was over me and happy to just be friends. ""  I remind them of the last time this happened to them and then they just sort of look a bit puzzled, remember and realise that I told them the same thing before!  I realise that the common thing in dating in Sweden, it seems that people hang out in groups and then gradually pair off.   While many Swedish girls are smart and independent, there are also many who don't seem to understand that a lot of guys, especially ones who have already expressed an interest, think that women can just be romanced into changing their minds.  Or that a lot of men don't respect women in the way that they want to be respected.   Its tragic to watch on both sides. First of all, the woman accepting what she thinks are nice friendly gestures, and then the guy thinking he is getting somewhere because she is accepting them.  Of course it all comes to a confused and mutually angry head, once the man makes a move and the woman rejects it.   Side note, one particularly irritating thing that I have observed in guys like this, is not just the belief that women are sex vending machines you fill with nice coins, but they also are entitled to given a ""turn"" by the woman.   Overall, your boy Coal, is a classic NiceGuy (tm)."

neckbeardstories,2xzqzw,cakeday_eq_birthday,56,Fri Mar 6 04:21:16 2015 UTC,"M'lady Sabre,  HOW COULD YOU? How in Sagan's name could you associate, even for a minute fraction of a quantity of time and even in the forced confines of a corridor, with such a cur and pretender as Ser Sam? I cannot mask the raw emotions which coursed through me as I comprehended that you spoke to him, the one who percussed you in such a careless manner in your fencing instruction time. His lugubrious apologies that ""it was an accident"" notwithstanding, how can you continually acquaint yourself with him?  You, of course not being as intelligent, brilliant, and in fact a genius as I am (to say nothing of your lack of euphoria), are not aware that society has brainwashed you to be attracted to inferior men, while ignoring men such as myself who have full possession of their faculties and understand the proper mode and manner as to how to treat a wonderful m'lady yourself.  Of course, Ser Sam will doubtless protest that he is in fact a good gentlesir, but nay, you must not believe, for he is a pretender. I daresay he would stumble when asked to elaborate on the differences between a trilby and a fedora. But more enlightening than that, he would never have a complete grasp of how MLP is an allegory for the human condition, told from a diametrically opposed viewpoint.  Let your biological imperative take the full measure of precedence. Perceive that I am so much intelligent and refined than Ser Sam. With each loquacious word I use, you can begin to comprehend how superior I am in my ability to ingest a codex of similar vocabulary (what the simpletons struggle to call a ""thesaurus"") and regurgitating various pieces of said codex into a vacuous lecture of indelible proportions.  I eagerly await your communicative reply.  /s"

While wop might have some offensive intention towards Sicilian immigrants to the USA, it rarely bothers actual Italians. Most Italians are happy to start nation bashing first.  If your objection is to the description of behavior, then as I said that is how swedes are known to behave. It is a passive culture in many ways. Especially compared to life in the UK. Public demonstrations of anger are rare, so do tend to startle and upset swedish guys trying to be clever.  This is a result of the culture and the way they are socialized. I don't mean this as a bad thing, more a result of culture shock.   And if you are meaning me saying Italians can be intense compared to Scandics, then why did you not haul the op up for saying Italians are the most romantic guys in the world?  It's just as much a presumptive generalization and ""racial slur"" as anything I said.   Now arise sir white knight of Arizona."

neckbeardstories,2xtjbj,kittenmommy,8,Tue Mar 10 00:01:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if there's more to this story (more Max being creepy) then a restraining order wouldn't have been a bad idea. Enough bystanders let the little things go by and eventually the creepy escalates. Ignorance is no excuse for hurting people.   Pardon the soap box, but I see women-bodied individuals in my country taught to be polite and being polite gets them assaulted. The ones who know what they're doing start with small transgressions and escalate as much as they can. The ones that don't, they'll keep on going (without the same purpose) and end up in similar places (doing damage).   Now switch the gender roles, expectations, sexes, genders. Shake all that up a bit because it's not one uniform story.  No, I don't think I have an actual solution. I hope we can teach our children and siblings to find their voice and teach them to stand up for their neighbors. I hope WE can speak up.   I've only just started lurking here but I'm cringing not only at the neckbeards but the bystanders who might have been able to do something. Of course, it's frustrating when the police say ""we can't do anything."" So I get that. But the utter helplessness scares the bejeezus outta me. It terrifies me enough to post this here. :("
neckbeardstories,2xtjbj,CoQuickAg,-2,Wed Mar 4 02:07:29 2015 UTC,"Your comment makes me cringe so hard.  Besides being some inane drivel about ""women bodied individuals"" and ""switch gender roles, expectations, sexes, genders,"" which makes no sense in this context, you give us a strawman (""we don't like harrassment""0???) but they cant even knock it down (""no i dont think i have an actual solution"").  What you're saying is that we should be filing legal proceedings against 8th graders who crush hard.  You try to make a distinction between those than know what they are doing, and those that don't (WTF does this even mean?)  doesn't make a difference because they end up in the same place.  So lets as a society start litigating and getting court orders every time a little boy is acting inappropriately /s.  JEEEEZZZ man.  Court proceedings solve everything /s.    So why don't we teach parents to teach their children to stand up for themselves (not their neighbors), so that little girl can tell the creep to ""fuck off"" themselves, and not go running for help when someones acting inappropriately.  Rather than raising a society of tattle-tales like you suggest, lets raise a society of strong willed people who have the guts to stand up for themselves.  Lets not rely on people to stand up for their neighbors, but instead instill values so individuals will zealously assert their own rights.  Not trying to rain on your gender-equality/identity parade, but it is mindless ""cause promotion"" to be bringing up those topics when they just aren't relevant."
neckbeardstories,2xtjbj,johnnypilgrim,6,Wed Mar 4 17:12:58 2015 UTC,"I agree that the ""women bodied individuals"" bit was super cringey, but as for the rest of his comment, I agree. Girls are taught to be polite, and creepy, shitty people (though usually men) use that politeness to prey on women, particularly on young women. A lot of women don't feel safe if they tell a dude directly to back off, so they use what's called ""soft nos"". Like, ""Oh, I can't go out tonight, I have to wash my hair"". And can you blame them? When some women are direct, they are murdered. We joke about giving out rejection hotlines to men who are persistently pursuant, and that's because some people won't take no for an answer.   It would be wonderful if, we, as a culture, started telling women it's okay to say ""No, I'm not interested, leave me alone!"" But that doesn't even deter some people. Even direct nos leave some people thinking that they just need to try harder to get that no to change. And that's when the law needs to get involved, because those people, even if they are 7th graders, can be dangerous."
neckbeardstories,2xtjbj,frowning-at-you,3,Wed Mar 4 19:58:10 2015 UTC,"I'd rather see more effort put on educators and parents, that when a kid that age is already creeping girls out, to step in and sit the kid down and explain in blunt terms why that's unacceptable, and what the consequences will be if they don't stop, and if enough red flags are evident, bring in mental health services. A kid that young, acting badly enough for the other people to even contemplate a restraining order, says to me there's a major breakdown in this kid's parenting - or he's already showing signs of being emotionally unstable, and that should be addressed immediately.  It's a common theme with a lot of them - when confronted with how unacceptable their behavior is, they're dumbfounded that anyone would have a problem with it. And in many of the stories, they have soft, ineffectual, coddling parents. Maybe half the problem is they were never told ""NO, you can't act like that!""? And are indulged with the parents BUYING the fedoras and not noticing that their kids smell?   It irks me when the victims are tasked with dealing with these creeps. What about their parents? What about their teachers? What about holding the creep responsible for his own actions? This should have been intervened on long before the girl's parents even began to think about restraining orders."
neckbeardstories,2xtjbj,FatMidAgeMagnet,2,Thu Mar 5 22:04:09 2015 UTC,"I agree. It'd be great if teachers were given more power in that domain. But if a kid's parents are already ignoring problems--""Little Bobby wouldn't do that!""--it can cause more pain for the victim. Having the police tell a parent, ""Hey, your kid is behaving poorly,"" and then the kid, ""Hey, you can't do that, here's why, and here's where the consequences will take you,"" impresses upon a kid and his parents how bad his behavior has gotten.  Teachers are already responsible for so much, and having to schedule parent teacher conferences about how one kid is harassing another is another thing they'd also have to manage and find time for."
neckbeardstories,2xtjbj,frowning-at-you,1 point,Fri Mar 6 01:27:51 2015 UTC,"I think FatMidAgeMagnet helped explain things better.   Ultimate end goal? Everyone able to speak up for themselves. Right now that's really hard. I know I'm trained to give soft no's and even being aware of that, it's hard to break that habit. Sure, now I feel safer to give hard no's and know I will be taken seriously. But in undergrad? HAH. It's a safety factor. Which is messed up 'cuz the only way to get through to some people is to be a ""total bitch"" and be very rude. I wish I could find the journal that hit K&P recently. Even in a sex positive and extra accepting place, the woman telling her story got reamed for being ""rude"" to the stranger who invaded her personal space and used a pet name (sweetheart, or something equally NOT endearing and just plain creepy coming from a stranger).   Yes, I want these kids to be able to stand up for themselves. But we're nowhere near that place and until then, they need help. They need someone in a position of power to do something. And they need to find a way to put themselves in a position of power. But it's my opinion that we are only gonna get to step two by addressing step one first."

neckbeardstories,2xq56l,_EndSinister,7,Sat Mar 7 15:25:47 2015 UTC,"sorry for the late response.  the question about his father comes from the idea of why some neckbeards have a literal neck beard.  if a boy's father didn't spend 10 minutes explaining how to properly shave, you can bet they didn't have much meaningful interaction at all.  the male role model question comes from the fact that not everyone with an inactive father is a neckbeard.  my best friend in school was raised by a single mother but had a music coach that he really looked up to.  i also wouldn't have been surprised if he had said his male role model was a video game character, anime character, or some otger fictional character from fiction."

neckbeardstories,2xhwcl,DocSporky510,17,Sat Feb 28 21:16:15 2015 UTC,"the nature of art   Man, just got triggered!  I studied art in college. Art departments have their own issues, with the never ending war of sneers from the ""fine artists"" against the ""commercial, sell out artists"", but it's a form of neckbeardism - nothing is more in love with the sound of their own voice than a coddled college fine art major, who thinks they're going to be the next Hockney. They didn't wear fedoras, they had their own uniform - all black clothes, starting with black tights or stretch jeans, dyed red hair, they all smoked cloves, were pale and sickly looking, had a constant sneer on their faces, and walked around with the faint scent of elitism.   We all had to take a class called ""The Practice of Art"" - it was supposed to be a nuts and bolts approach to living as an artist, as a business, but it was taught either as a punishment to other art professors, or in our case, one of the assistants at the campus art gallery, who spent most of her time ranting about the galleries in town (large US city) who refused her work, or how to force a municipality to change the code for a warehouse or industrial space into a work/live loft, and have the state pay for the plumbing and necessities. The rest of the time it was ""discussion"", which was 2 or 3 fine art majors holding court and babbling the most idiotic, inane, maddening opinions and rants you could imagine. A few I could remember:   The government should pay all artists a lot of money, because: snowflakes.  Art is a secret language, and if you don't understand art, it's because you're not part of the club, and not worthy to know the language.  Any art outside of a very narrow subset of abstract expressionism is garbage, and should be burned/destroyed. (Yes, the pimple faced kid with the dyed red hair thinks Michelangelo's works should be burned, as ""Nobody can possibly learn anything from it."") (Just one punch. Just one. Please. I won't even aim for his zit covered nose.) Any art that is done for money is worthless. (Unless the government subsidizes it, right? Right?)   I have seen the circles of hell, I have walked the paths of demons, I have suffered alongside my brethren, because I took this class. It soured me on the fine art world permanently, even though now, years and years later, I've met decent people in the fine art world (enduring many, many white wine and cheese gallery openings and shows to find them) (Edited to add - me and my non-fine art majors stopped going halfway through the semester, we figured we'd try again next semester, as the teacher and the curriculum seemed to change every semester. Nope. No need. We got A's. Everyone in the class did. Found out later the ""teacher' was forbidden to ever teach again, because of it - her attitude was ""art can't be graded"", and just handed everyone an A to ""fight the powah"".)  I guess, if you scratch a neckbeard, or a fine art major, they're all assholes underneath, with different paint jobs."
neckbeardstories,2xhwcl,FatMidAgeMagnet,7,Sun Mar 1 01:04:11 2015 UTC,It feels like we're on the verge of coining a new term: Artbeard.
neckbeardstories,2xhwcl,OmniscientSpork,3,Sun Mar 1 01:15:29 2015 UTC,"It works. Because what is a neckbeard but the product of a super sheltered or catered to upbringing? They have entitlement and feel superior because of their ""intellect"" but lack the life experience to make it applicable. They think they are more intelligent because of a GPA or IQ number or because they are purists with obscure hobbies.  Then you've got the artbeard. They spent their formative artistic years spending mom and dads money in a closed sheltered environment with people from their class and socio-economic background. They have no applicable life experience to make great art that connects with people so they become purists in whatever artistic movement they decide elitist enough to make the artsy. They know the theory, they can pass the test, but ultimately leave art school uninspired because they have no applicable perspective on any harsh realities that go unnoticed or ignored. They become bitter hacks who's superiority complex is based solely on their ability to regurgitate what they deem as art and by no means plan on connecting with the world around them.   They're basically one and the same."
neckbeardstories,2xhwcl,dwolfy,2,Sun Mar 1 11:02:54 2015 UTC,"I prefer asshole.   In our city, all you have to say is ""Art Academy"", because they're stuffed to the gills with that type - rich kids whose parents use the school to babysit them, they slouch around that part of town with a permanent scowl and every piercing and body modification you can imagine.   It's one of the funnier parts of the art world. I'm an artist, but I dress the way I want, which at home is very casual, unless I'm painting, then I wear stuff I don't care if I get paint on. (I'm 100% digital at work) (OMG I get paid, I sold out!) The art class types all consider themselves rebels and non-conformists - but they all wear the exact same clothes, hairstyles, body mods, tattoos, and bad hair dye.   I always felt, if they spent as much time on their art and their skills, as they do on their uniforms, and complaining about everyone else, they might get somewhere."

I just did it on my own time ( while living a life of suffering, bringing new meaning to "" suffering artist ."" ) Do give the Bacon a look.

Designed to shade the wearer's head and face from the sun, pith helmets were often worn by people of European origin in the tropics, but have also been used in other contexts.

neckbeardstories,2x90us,FinnSven,1 point,Tue Mar 10 12:02:03 2015 UTC,"Several things!   Firstly, I am British. (born in Yorkshire, grew up in London.)  Me and a pair of actual football hooligans, were going to fill in a brony once. We did not in the end as it is hard to justify to yourself kicking the shit out of a weeping, bearded, cowering, grown man, even if he does own toys intended for little girls.  However, should I ever hear one affect an obvious fake British accent, well that is pushing it. I would certainly feel the need to punch him so hard all the sunshine sparkles would be forever in his eyes.  Secondly, you would need to go to an antique store to get one of those hats. There is a tiny possibility Saville row shops might have a new one, but I have only ever seen them in museums. Or military surplus shops. Maybe.   I myself went into a large and tall gentlemans outfitters, not realizing such places cater for people who can't get clothes in high street shops, asking about a coat in the window.  The owner told me I was (I am 180cm/5 foot 10 and I think I was 75 kg/160 lbs) too normal sized and joked I might need to eat a pie or two before I could shop there. I left without being offended, everyone makes mistakes and that is not the shop owners fault.   Fucking bronies."
neckbeardstories,2x90us,frau-fremdschamen,1 point,Sun Mar 1 19:13:14 2015 UTC,Does fill in mean attack? I don't know that expression.
neckbeardstories,2x90us,SimeonBDixon,2,Tue Mar 3 07:01:09 2015 UTC,"""Fill In"" means an unfair beating, usually on a single person by two or more assailants.   It is seen as ok by people like this, when it is in reprisal for a previous unfair attack, sexual misconduct or another slight such as grassing. (Telling the police or other authorities about someones actions for the express purpose of getting them in trouble.)   In this case, said brony had upset the younger brother of one of these hooligans. I got involved because I was friends with the younger and older brothers, and while I was not involved in their inter firm fights or other senseless violence, they did seem to trust me.  There was a girl involved, and the brony had been sexually aggressive towards her.    However, when confronted by the older brother, his best friend, both wearing tracksuits, gold chains, soverigen rings, and myself in a leather jacket, army boots, and close cut hair, the brony actually screamed, curled up into a ball and started crying about the police.   Hence we did leave it, ""filling in"" usually has an intention of scaring a target, he looked scared enough.  Plus trouble with the law was the last thing we all needed at that point."
neckbeardstories,2x90us,frau-fremdschamen,-11,Tue Mar 3 07:37:11 2015 UTC,"I'm a brony and I act nothing like this. I don't own any MLP toys or shirts, I don't creep on anybody and I don't treat it as a bloody superpower. I'm beginning to think people on this sub are generalizing all bronies as creepy neckbeards.

I will admit that I am socially awkward but I don't walk around like I'm a big shot.  I also don't stalk people I am attracted to. I'm just an awkward guy who wears a fedora and likes stereotypically neckbeardish things."
neckbeardstories,2x90us,Epidemilk,2,Fri Feb 27 03:55:04 2015 UTC,"I will be honest here and please don't take this as a personal attack.   Macho, violent, beer drinking, football/""manly sport"" fans widely regard owning toys or watching cartoons as an adult childish and laughable.   If these toys are primarily intended for little girls, that will confuse and likely anger them further.   I agree that being like that is in itself childish and intolerant, but a key difference is is that these people do deem violence an appropriate reaction.   Whether or not you want to justify it as jealousy, some kind of primal repressed homosexual feelings that confuse them, or just saying they plain don't understand, then fine.   Its taken 50 years or so for it to no longer be considered appropriate to gay bash.  Might be a bit longer for them to accept Bronies.   Personally I am these days more tolerant of things, even if I think they are childish and stupid.  But I don't drink in North East London pubs and have to talk to these people because they know where to get coke from, anymore."

Just because someone wears a Fedore, weras a bad excuse for a beard, or is a bronie, he is not automatically a neckbeard. On the other hand he can have no beard, have never even worn a hat, and still be a neckbeard.  It is about his character and how he behaves, that decides whether someone is a neckie or not. We often talk about the fedora in the heart when meeting a neckbeard who at first glance seems normal, but once you talk to him the neckbeard comes through"
neckbeardstories,2xe2o9,FatMidAgeMagnet,11,Tue Mar 10 00:58:47 2015 UTC,"A fedora does not make someone a neckbeard, this is completely true - what makes a neckbeard is acting like one.

Yes, it sucks that non-neckbeards are accused of acting like them, but that's on them, not this group. We can't change the way they act - and we have every right to talk about them, wether it ""pisses you the fuck off"" or not.

So your reasoning for calling a trilby a fedora is because random people ""call the rimmed ones fedoras?"" Let's get bowlers and top hats in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A trilby is a trilby and a member of the fedora family. But that's not what you said. You said a trilby is a fedora, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the fedora family fedoras, which means you'd call top hats, bowlers, and other hats fedoras, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

The local people didn't take too kindly to the resemblance the offspring of the rapes had to their Mongolian parent. Hence ""Mongoloid.""   However, a lot of people don't think about that context first since the 20th century tried to legitimize stuff like cranial measuring (can't remember what its called, but the idea that measuring your skull determined if you were weak-willed, prone to mental illness, etc) as a means to perpetuate racism and ablism under the guise of mental illness care. Mongoloid was used in the ""clinical"" sense during that period and I think that changed how future generations looked at the term."

The dude that always has some impressive story to tell about some ridiculous thing that never happened, and they are always adamant that it happened. They are also usually people that have to one up everyone else any time they tell a story or really talk about anything.  I used to work with a guy like this at a video game store. He was about 6""1, chubby, and though not particularly old, was balding very badly and had super light blonde hair. Also had an ugly, rude wife who no one liked.  Other than his lying, he was actually a good dude, and would give you the shirt off his back if you needed it. Due to that, his constant lies were more of an amusement than a problem. It was funny. So, here's a short list of some of the lies he told us:   The girl I was talking to and head over heels for ""asked him on a movie date, and was totally into him"". She was stupid cute (as in not reflecting the type of women that evidence shows would be attracted to him), strongly disliked him, and generally didn't date white guys. He also ""Let me have"" this girl that came into the store whose number I got, because he totally could have picked her up if he felt like it. He used to have sex with his hot teachers in high school regularly. He had sex with his best friends hot mom. He traded stocks, and had a shit ton of money just sitting in a bank account somewhere, so he didn't really need to work. He read the dictionary (Yes, the whole dictionary) multiple times as a kid, just because he felt like it. Same for the bible (he's a staunch atheist, but just wanted to ""educate"" himself).  He had a computer that was ""too powerful"" to run Crysis (a graphics-intensive (for the time) shooting game that came out around that time) well just as it came out.  He has apparently been a butcher and knows everything about butchery, but all of his stories sound made up and don't fit into his life chronologically. He also claimed a bunch of other former jobs that didn't seem to make sense, but I can't remember them. He used to spout urban legends as if they were parts of his life (particularly all these people with ridiculous names like Lemonjello and Oranjello, Shithead (sha-theed), etc., whom he all knew personally). Various stories about all the fights he'd been in, and of course kicked ass in every one. Also, he tried martial arts, but apparently didn't learn anything he didn't know already.    That's all i can remember off the top of my head, but it was basically constant bullshitting and one-upping trying to impress people. I loved every second of it."

In one sense, it can be used to describe rightful steps to protect oneself properly while in a difficult situation, such as what steps to take to protect oneself after being fired.  But, in a different sense, according to New York Times language expert William Safire, it describes ""the bureaucratic technique of averting future policy accusations of policy error or wrongdoing by deflecting responsibility in advance"".  It often involves diffusing responsibility for one's actions as a form of insurance against possible future negative repercussions.  It can denote a type of institutional risk-averse mentality which works against accountability and responsibility, often characterized by excessive paperwork and documentation,  which can be harmful to the institution's overall effectiveness.  The activity, sometimes seen as instinctive,  is generally unnecessary towards accomplishing the goals of the organization, but helpful to protect a particular individual's career within it, and it can be seen as a type of institutional corruption working against individual initiative.

neckbeardstories,2wy1ti,OhGoodOhMan,4,Tue Feb 24 02:57:40 2015 UTC,"Since violence didn't work the first time, I would say this is a justifiable second step. However, since violence didn't work; there is a chance that this wont either and Krabs may try an underhanded approach next time. Especially if everyone fucking with him continues to fuck with him and/or he somehow finds out you were behind it.  I highly recommend ignoring him from now on, but also buy a tazer or something just in case. Tell your friends to leave him alone unless provoked, just to make sure he doesn't bring a gun to school one day.  Edit: You should also talk you your university's(?) supervisors as well as the police if this escalates."

neckbeardstories,2wy1ti,Pinkhouses,3,Tue Feb 24 17:55:50 2015 UTC,"Okay maybe I'm the minority voice here, but that act was just straight up bullying. Krabs may be a colossal waste of euphoria, but did you really have to initiate a plan to beat the shit out of him? In all honesty, I would have sent the messages to the police, inform the school. Make sure the authorities fuck him up badly, then walk away. By bullying this guy you're only fueling flames to the firepit of neckbeards. But on a positive note, the rest of the Krabs story has been some good kek."

neckbeardstories,2wy1ti,SLGC,11,Tue Feb 24 03:57:33 2015 UTC,"I know, he was in the wrong too. But if you treat someone like that, it will only make them more angry/neurotic, and therefore more likely to do it to other people. It's a vicious cycle and I don't blame you because it's hard, but sometimes you just have to be the bigger person. Maybe he's having a hard time at home because his parents are getting divorced or he was abused as a child. Obviously I don't know, I'm just saying it's not outside the realm of possibility. Compassion is hard but necessary is all I am saying."
neckbeardstories,2wy1ti,Pinkhouses,14,Tue Feb 24 04:00:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know if what she did was too bad. The physical attack maybe a little but the early phases were brilliant. Being nice to these people doesn't get the message across, it takes a full on confrontation. Hopefully it will wake him up and he'll realize how much a dick he's been... I said hopefully not likely. Also, keep in mind these kids are in high school so it goes without saying they're going to pull high school shenanigans. I'm just glad we got a play by play."

neckbeardstories,2wz09n,MayPerkins,22,Tue Feb 24 08:48:37 2015 UTC,"OK, a couple things here. You didn't give any background information, on anything. What was this gathering of hobbyists for? What was your specialization that led to this encounter? Who are these people you keep dropping into the story? Seriously, I had a very hard time following what was happening here."
neckbeardstories,2wz09n,twilightsquid,5,Tue Feb 24 15:53:41 2015 UTC,I was being vague to disguise identities. We're medieval reenactors.  The disabilities are fibro and panic disorder (the depression is just there sometimes).
neckbeardstories,2wz09n,twilightsquid,8,Tue Feb 24 21:20:41 2015 UTC,"I understand wanting to protect identities, and it's cool that you're doing that, but there was a general lack of information that made it a little hard to follow.    Just from a reader's perspective, one of the main issues I had following the story was the fact that characters would appear part way through the story, like Owen and Lila. You mentioned them, but never really gave much of an introduction. Partway through we're suddenly introduced to two characters with no background information who seem to be important(?) but drop away again almost as quickly as they appeared.    Also:     medieval reenactors     That sounds kind of cool, I assume this had something to do with the neckbeard's advances? Unfortunately, the lack of this information made it feel like the reader was dropped into the middle of a story that was already halfway done.    Also, if you don't mind my asking, what was the gathering for? was it just a place for people to gather and discuss their hobbies or was it for a more professional purpose?    Either way, I'm sure you have plenty of stories with a hobby like that and I look forward to hearing more :)"

neckbeardstories,2ww96a,upvotetown,46,Mon Feb 23 18:33:00 2015 UTC,Just checked his Facebook (7 friends). His latest comment is bitching about being a nice guy and no one wanting him. Pages and pages of forever alone shit. He's like a stereotype. Also he's a furry apparently.
neckbeardstories,2ww96a,FalconPunchYourDick,26,Mon Feb 23 18:42:27 2015 UTC,"When ""nice guys"" complain about douches getting the girls, they never think about the fact that theyre only being nice to get the girl in bed"
neckbeardstories,2ww96a,JamJarre,21,Mon Feb 23 20:15:02 2015 UTC,"I think some of them may be good guys. Some of them may be assholes. Some of them may just be average dudes. But when they're ""nice"" it's just an act because they're insecure. So you can't tell what kind of guy they'd actually be if they were confident. So they might actually be good guys, or assholes underneath, but as long as they're stuck in the bullshit ""nice guy"" mentality, you can't tell."
neckbeardstories,2ww96a,FalconPunchYourDick,6,Mon Feb 23 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"Being confident and assertive is the way to do it. Being shy and waiting for them to make a move is never going to work.  The reason that ""girls date assholes"" is that assholes actually ask them out in a confident way that reflects their own certainty that they're God's own gift. Meekly trying to get someone to love you by buying them things and being nice to them is not attractive. It's clingy and weird."
neckbeardstories,2ww96a,Terrible_Wingman,2,Tue Feb 24 15:21:00 2015 UTC,"Well, there is also the factor that if you put them down they feel like you're of higher status, even if you aren't. So to some degree it works, but it's definitely far from the only way to do it. The vast fucking majority of relationships don't start that way. It takes a certain kind of person with a certain lack of empathy to pull that shit off."
neckbeardstories,2ww96a,noirthesable,2,Tue Feb 24 15:31:36 2015 UTC,"True, most assholes are confident people. Confidence attracts girls, maybe not as much as looks,  but an ugly confident guy gets more girls than an ugly shy guy."

I looked way sexier with a beard anyways""  A smidgen (halfling/hobbit/kender) hippie rogue. when they go on adventures and accidentally ask her to pack lunch, they end up with candy and psychadelic mushrooms for whole trip.   there is so much comedy and action you cannot dislike this series unless you are a firm men's rights advocate, because its about the fedora on your heart"

neckbeardstories,2wuka5,FinnSven,0,Mon Mar 23 08:50:30 2015 UTC,"This guy sounds like an intolerant prick.   Personally I think adults playing RPGs, card games, discussing comics, is immature.  But I don't rip on others for doing so. (Unless it is playfully with people I know can take my abrasive humour.)  I do understand that different people enjoy different things, so when I don't approve or like it, I do tolerate that they do and let them enjoy it. It does not endear you to people, or make you sound smart when you disparage stuff people like.   Can I ask what you mean by ""its for RP's not Power Gamers?"", though?"
neckbeardstories,2wuka5,FinnSven,6,Mon Feb 23 11:21:40 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I can explain a bit. Powergamers are people who go into a game with the specific intention of getting to the end. They don't care about a game's story or interaction, they want to get from point A to point B as fast as possible. This is in contrast to OP's group, who are in it for both the story and gameplay.  I look at people who play RPGs and stuff like that in the same way that I view people who play a sport or instrument for fun into their adult years. I don't know if being 20 qualifies me, but I'm an avid MtG player and I play intramural flag football at my campus whenever I get the chance. Both are things I started as a kid and the magic of both still haven't worn off on me yet. RPGs have just as many addictive qualities, like story, player interactivity, and the ability to create a world much like a video game developer would, as a sport does.   To summarize, I come from a different viewpoint, but I feel more or less the same as you. I can understand why you think the way you do though, and I appreciate you being unbiased."

neckbeardstories,2wuwvo,PaganBacon,3,Mon Feb 23 11:11:30 2015 UTC,"Let me fix that for you....  Hello friends! I'm new to this reddit, but I've got some greaaaat neckbeardy stories to share, starting with a dude named Rood. Let me introduce the cast!   TheWorldEndsWithFF(FF for short): Normal dude, bout 5""11, 210ish pounds earlier in the story, 170ish pounds towards the end. Obsessed with Final Fantasy, KH, and similar subjects. Father recently deceased. Puppy who became my most cherished family member after my father died, recently deceased. Unreasonable love for turtles and whales. Kind of a little bitch.   JackieChan(JC 4 short): Best friendo. Kool dude. Kindred soul. Crazy good at Tekken and MK. 11 out of 10 no homo.   Paige: Me, him, and JC are the three musketeers of urban south Florida. Really sensitive, coupled with low self esteem, but a great friend none the less.   Wanta: Ladykiller. Also a rad guy.   Vexen: Cool girl, but poor decision making skills, and purposeful obliviousness to consequences placed on others because of such makes her not so cool.   Rood: In essence, a pretty normal guy, but in spirit, the neckbeardiest neckbeard I believe I've ever met. Not overweight, but not fit. All clothes he owns are too large. Stalker to the nth degree. Horribly spiteful. Hates all my friends (with the exception of females). Very mischievous.   And now friends, let us ride into the distance as the sunset of introduction falls behind a horizon of text, making way for the moon of storytelling to gaze over us. I've been friends with Rood for like four-ish years. He's always been very weird when it comes to girls. I guess I didn't notice it back then, because I too was a young bird, still learning how to puff my chest out. The story starts waaaaaaaaaay back within the midst of highschool, but I shall spare the prequelities (idk if that's a real word but it should be) and skip ahead to his blossoming and a neckbeard.   In the late months of 2014, i was freshly graduated high school graduate. JC and Paige were a grade younger than me, and alas, I could not spend time with the bros as frequently as I wished. In comes Rood. We used to hang alot in high school, and since he was a year older, he too had free time on his hands. One day, we decided to help a friend move. Half way through, Rood had other plans. He began by telling everyone that he was just leaving to go home, despite promising to help until 12 like we all had. Since he was my ride, I had no choice bit to go with him. I apologized to Big T( the friend we were helping move) and we left, only to end up at a local Tutti Fruitti's.   At first I was skeptical. ""I'm pretty sure this isn't you're house... or mine..."" to which he quelled all my skepticism (not really) ""Nah, I'm meeting a friend"". Half an hour passes us before a faintly familiar face rolls along. It was Vexen. Rood jumped up and bear hugged her. I took a moment to process things, and then said hello in as benign a fashion as I could. Vexen was actually the first girlfriend of our old friend Dial Tone. I had only met her once in Highschool, but that was more than enough for me. Anyhow, the night progress into some kind of weird date between the two, and then we thankfully leave. This goes on throughout the summer, and is important for two reasons. First, and I acknowledge maybe a little pathetic of me, it pretty much destroyed me for a while. My dad passed away from cancer in June of that year, and my puppy a few months after that. Vexen had (fallen? I guess) for Rood's (Charms? Ehh) idk, but they had a very platonic, slightly adulterous thing going on. During the summer, they would invite me along to all of their outings, which were pretty normal, but usually would just stick to themselves, leaving me to find ways to occupy my time alone.   Why didn't I just ignore them and stay home, you might ask, you bright young reader? Well, unbeknownst to you, and probably Rood and Vexen, with out my dad at home to keep order, my mom and sister would be at each other's throats, destroying the house in the process. I would even get shit from them if it tried to decline an invitation from them. Why am I telling you all this? Trust me friends, it will become maaaaaaaad important in later installments. Reason number 2 as to why this is so important. Rood gained an UNREASONABLE confidence from this whole thing with Vexen, now assuming that he could grab ANY m'lady that he wanted. The thing is, and this may sound spiteful, but it's just factual, Vexen wasn't what you would consider to be a catch. She also had a boyfriend for most of this, and is more or less known for her lack of decency. I don't mean to say anything bad about her, and honestly the reason I don't talk to her much these days is solely because of how low they both made me feel during that year, and how she keeps trying to repeat it. But more to the point, after a while, I started going to a local community college, and got a job at a major superstore. I started making new friends, and JC and Paige finally graduated, so we were inseparable again :D.   On the next episode of Rood The Neckbeard, Rood falls for FF's new M'lady friends, and falls hard. Also, will Rood beat the evil douchebag, Jackie Chan, in a battle for the mall M'lady's heart? Find out on the next episode of Rood The Neckbeard! P.S. Sorry this one was odd, and not so neckbeardy, but I had to get the back story up and running so full cringe is achieved in the later installments. I also apologize for any grammar errors and lame story telling. I promise, I'll get the next one out soon!"

neckbeardstories,2wt8d4,AlTheKiller2113,2,Mon Feb 23 03:17:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with you with this story so far, but I predict he will develop an obsession or something, in later stories, which justifies the intensely negative light that OP puts on him in this story.   But really, this story could have been written much quicker:   So I was at the park with this guy, and I thought we were just friends. I mentioned my weight and he lifted my shirt and told me that I wasn't fat. He was trying to be flirty and sweet but it was awkward and made me uncomfortable, especially since I had an eating dissorder.  A little later he tried to kiss me, but I really wasn't into it, since I saw us as just friends and I was seeing someone else. I was too shy to tell him at the time so I told him online later that night.   Honestly, everything else just seemed like it was OP's issues with herself, put in such a way to paint us a negative image of the guy. The fact that he took the risk for that first kiss might have crossed a line in their friendship, but if that is all he did, then it was hardly assault."

This belongs in /r/offmychest  or some other sob story shit sub. The story is literally some faggot tried to kiss her. It was in three sentences that somehow were littered with more stupid shit about her problems in the middle of a novel of how she's different. I shouldn't know her age and preference in coffee if it has nothing to do with the shitty story. If he had learned that she liked it through some obscure stalking method you fuckers are good at  then that's a whole different fucking story.

We're not here to make fun of everyone, we're here to raise awareness and highlight how fucking creepy this is.  Most people provide age and a few personal details in their stories. It's called good storytelling; it explains why the author does what he does (or in this case, why ""some faggot"" intruding on her personal space is creepy and not okay in any social sense) and also lets us feel some semblance of realism (y'know, the thing this sub wants badly to maintain).  Methinks you're just a bit butthurt over something else, because no one else seems to have this problem, and the same type of thing can be found in most other stories on this sub."

It use to be good, now is just a shitty place to tell everyone how pathetic they are and how mommy didn't love them.  She says she had coffee with artificial sweetener and that's it.

neckbeardstories,2wqug1,idcri,97,Sun Feb 22 08:29:44 2015 UTC,"Start with dieting. Maybe you're overweight, maybe you're not; I don't know, but if you are then shedding the extra weight can be a MASSIVE self confidence boost, which will solve a lot of those issues. Myfitnesspal is a great app that can help you reach a goal weight. Remember that 1lb (0.5kg) of body mass needs about 3500kcal to make, so if you eat 500kcal less than you need per day (Myfitnesspal will work out what your base metabolic requirements are) you'll lose 1lb per week on average. /r/loseit will help you more.  Okay, that's step one. We're about 3 months down the line and you've lost 10lbs give-or-take. You've shed some weight, so you're feeling more energetic and you've got some of that BO under control. Time to start exercising!   What's your goal? ""Look good""? That's secondary. Looking good comes as a bonus prize. Wanna run distance? Couch to 5k is where it's at. Follow that program, and use map my run to track your running. Running is free, and a good pair of trainers are easy to come by. /r/running will help you.  Wanna be strong? Stronglifts 5x5 is a good strength program, but you'll need a gym membership. Otherwise there are plenty of body weight programs you can follow. /r/fitness will help you.  ""I want both"" me too. Can't really have both though. Your body is like a lump of raw iron that can become a useful tool: It can be a hammer, it can be a saw, or it can be a hammersaw; no one will use a hammersaw to cut wood if they have access to a good saw. I'd recommend picking one goal and working towards that. If you genuinely want to be strong AND have good cardiovascular fitness, a good martial art is a nice place to start. You'll never be as strong as a dedicated lifter, and you'll never run as far as a dedicated runner, but you might be able to break fools in a couple of years, and that's just as good.  Okay. Getting a job. This is all done at the same time as the above. First off, swallow ALL your pride. All of it. You're getting a shitty job in retail. ""I'm above that."" No. You're not. You live with your parents. You are not above anything. A job in retail will get some money coming in and show the world that a job is something you can cope with. Get up, go to work, come home. Keep the damn job. Take that experience, show that you can deal with customers in a polite way and leverage that experience into getting a better job. It's tough, but you can do it. Send out applications daily if you can; if you throw enough shit at a wall, and some of it will stick. Find people on Reddit who work in your desired career and ask them for advice on how to structure your CV, what to include, and what skills to get, then do those things. Having a retail job might get you some management experience which will look good on a CV too.  ""Cheezewizz2000, you've given me all this adbuse (advice+abuse) and not told me how to get girls yet."" Yeah, well, that is something that will come in its own sweet time. You know all that exercising you've been doing? You're more attractive now, and you have a hobby that gets you out the house, so doing something else might come more easily to you. Board game shops tend to hold gaming nights, so go to those. Running events are held in your town yearly, so go to those (there are also running groups that meet weekly). Fencing is fun and lets you pretend to be Zorro for 2 hours a week. You'll meet someone, it'll happen. Just, you know, be yourself where ""yourself"" is the new, interesting, fit, healthy, employed person with a cool hobby that you are going to become.  ""That sounds hard and like it will take a long time."" Yeah well, that's life; we all live it anyway. If you don't wanna do all that maybe take a gamble on something just falling in your lap and stay smelly, unemployed and in your mum's house. Who knows; it's got to have worked for someone once, right?"

Make sure you take care of your teeth/mouth too. If you don't you'll have awful breath and you could get gum disease or tooth decay. Bad teeth are insanely painful. Clothes: Make sure you have actually clean clothing to wear, even if you have to do your own laundry. Wearing stuff for multiple days isn't good, it gets rank."

neckbeardstories,2wqug1,lolwatzki,6,Mon Feb 23 13:59:14 2015 UTC,"First step is admitting you have a problem, so good job with that. Got to know your flaws before working on them.   Biggest, most important thing: see a therapist. First thing Monday morning, call your healthcare provider and set up an appt. Check their website, many have a mental health number available. I know there's a stigma against it, and you may not have any mental illness, but this can help IMMENSELY. Seriously, I think just about any person could benefit from therapy. You're not in a good place right now, and you realize that. This will help so much with everything else. Hardcore spring cleaning. Might sound dumb but trust me, it helps. Dedicate a few days next week to completely cleaning your space. You may want to brew a pot of coffee and put some music on for morale. (I like Ametsub for cleaning but do what works for you.) Room, closet, desk, bathroom, laundry. Vacuum, dust, clean the walls and baseboards, even! Maybe rearrange your furniture. Go through all of your stuff and clothes, throw out or donate the things you wouldn't take with you if you were going to move out shortly and things you really don't use. Cleans out a lot of emotional clutter in the process. You're turning a new leaf here. Moving out is a tangible reality. Get a the shittiest shit job that will hire you asap. Retail, drive thru, gas station, waiter, call center... Literally whatever you can get that is legal. There is no shame in that. You're working and saving toward something better. Monday morning after you call your healthcare provider, do a few job apps and research local career fairs to hit up and make connections. Shine up your resume/cv and update your LinkedIn. r/socialskills and various job-hunting subreddits might have some advice. Prep answers to the common job interview questions. Don't give up hope! Set daily job app goals. So many a day or so many a week, etc. Next project, maybe Monday after lunch: agreed with some of the other commenters here, break out your spreadsheet and come up with a plan to improve dietary and exercise habits. Check out some of those subreddits. There's a lot of fun stuff out there. Do a little research. Judo, fencing, swing dance, lifting, running, whatever floats your boat. Add in a daily multivitamin while you're at it. Stick to the plan! As for BO and hygiene, scrub pits extra and use deodorant bar soap? Put on deodorant right out of the shower before smells can start brewing (well after drying off a bit first). Maybe make a doctors appt: they have prescription-strength deodorant available. Don't give up on yourself, and don't break the good habits you start. Everybody's got regrets about what they were like in the past. It will probably get you down on yourself now and then. You'll have bad days. Shame is a bitch. Work hard and move past it. Find a buddy to help keep you accountable if that helps you. Learn to be comfortable with yourself. (See: therapy bullet point) Doesn't have to happen all at once. It's always a journey. A relationship will happen in time once you start getting to the point where you can love yourself in a healthy way. That's where confidence starts. Maybe you don't need a lady right now, nothing wrong with that. Connect with people with similar interests. Meetup.com has a lot of groups all over, and probably will have gaming/sci-fi stuff or support groups for fellow socially awkward people. You might find some friends out there, who knows?   Good luck, man! I'm rooting for you."

Do not cut/shave cuz then you have to keep it up consistently) my underarm hair. The longer the hair, the smellier and wetter I am.

neckbeardstories,2wqug1,sram730,10,Sun Feb 22 08:37:24 2015 UTC,"Ok, if you want to change you should:  Ask those people dear to you specifically what annoys them about how you talk or what you talk about. Listen to them, write it down, come up with different ways to communicate. Look for some books at the library about respectful and effective communication, something like ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" or something.  Get a job, any job, and start saving so you can move out of your parents place. Also offer to be help around the house in the meantime. Cook, clean, do yard work.   You might want to talk to a cognitive behavioural therapist. They can help you change behaviours that are anti-social or that you don't like about yourself. You should especially talk to them about how you become obsessive and possessive with women you like. That's really not good.  Go through your closet and throw out any clothes that are stained, greasy, have holes in them or are clearly very worn. (Cut them up and use them for rags if you don't want to waste). When you get a job and have money to buy new clothes again don't just buy what you would normally buy, look at the mannequins in the store, try to incorporate some colour and make sure the clothes actually fit you well (ask a salesperson for help, that's what they are there for and the majority of sales staff want to see the people who they help leave the store feeling better about themselves and their bodies). I'm not saying you should have to look exactly like the store mannequin or a male model in a magazine or to wear clothes that make you feel uncomfortable, but it is important to keep up with fashion trends so that you look as though you are a functioning member of society and not a creepy outcast.  Try to find a new hobby that gets you interacting with more people. It's fine to keep up with the hobbies you already have, they don't make you a neckbeard, but being around other people will help you learn how to interact with others, it may also help you find someone you might be romantically interested in.   About the BO, I'm assuming you know to wear deodorant. If not, wear it. If so, try a new stronger brand (are you buying antiperspirant or deodorant? Look at the fine print). If that doesn't work, ask your doctor.  Good luck!"
neckbeardstories,2wqug1,oxfay,3,Sun Feb 22 09:32:26 2015 UTC,"You need clean clothes. Showering, and then putting dirty clothes back on, only reintroduces all that grime and bacteria to your skin. Head out to Goodwill and buy 3 pair of khaki pants, some nice polo shirts, a good belt, and a couple button-downs. Make sure that it's all in good shape! You almost can't fuck up with khakis and polos! Just make sure you tuck in the shirt, and wear your belt. While you're at it, try some good looking shoes. Don't wear athletic shoes unless you're an athlete. Instead, go to khol's and look for Sperry Top sider deck shoes. buy those or something similar. They're a grown-up shoe that is very versatile. They even look okay with white socks. Once you get your clothes, shower, and wash the hell out of your hair so you can go get a haircut. If you have shitty facial hair, shave it off. Stubble looks good on George Clooney, but you're probably not George Clooney.   For a finishing touch, find a nice looking watch. It doesn't need to be expensive, but it should look like you give a fuck. I'd look for a gold bezel, with a leather band. Nothing bling, just grown-up looking.   The only statement your clothing should make is ""I'm grown up enough to do my own laundry, and I'm good at it""   Anything else, and you'll come off as a tool."

neckbeardstories,2wqug1,odileLee,5,Mon Mar 9 06:22:38 2015 UTC,"Have you been tested for Aspergers?   You might have some level of it. The being bothered by things in an office could be a sign of it.   Has this been discussed with your psychiatrist? Some psychiatrists do not class Aspergers and Autism related conditions as illnesses, so it could be they have not looked for it.  A lot of people who are taken for Aspergers are not, its just because someone who has dealt with one Aspergers person has taken certain elements of that persons behaviour and homespun diagnosed someone who is maybe a bit withdrawn or even depressed.   But a lot of people are Aspergers are not noticed because they don't run into people who know what it is, or don't openly show so many symptoms.   I have an Aspie (yes I can call him that, he does not care) stepson, who seems social and a joker, which is why he was not diagnosed until the past year. (16 now).   I could be wrong, as I am only reading what you have written.  So best advice I have is take this list to your psychiatrist and ask them if they can arrange a test or interview with someone who specialises in autistic spectrum conditions."
neckbeardstories,2wqug1,FinnSven,6,Sun Feb 22 15:19:14 2015 UTC,"The fact that you're even asking this question shows that there is the capacity to change. You've already done the hardest part; admitting you have a problem. Here's some basic things you can do next that I think will help;   Cardio- just like in Zombieland, cardio exercises (running, biking, aerobics etc.) are extremely important for escape. In this case, it's escape from neckbeardism rather than zombies. Combined with a healthy diet, a good cardio regimen will help you keep your weight under control, instil confidence, and make your body feel better on the whole.  Employment- Quitting you job was a bad idea, especially for the reasons you mentioned. If you have a degree, try for something in your field, even if it's just part time. If you need help with your resume, contact your school's career center or a temp agency like Robert Half Inc.  If you don't have a degree, look in retail again. You may have hated it, but customer service jobs force people to come out of their shells and deal with the world. It's not always pleasant, but it will help you grow as a person. A job or going back to school will also mean less idle time to drive yourself crazy  Dress to impress- Go buy yourself some new clothes. Not only will it improve the smell, but you'll feel more confident in yourself. Try to get something a little different from your normal wardrobe too so you can have the option to mix it up and make things more interesting.  Interpersonal relationships- It sounds like you have some social anxiety. While doing the other stuff I said will help, this is something that will take a lot more work than just buying a new shirt and going for a run. Talk to these people who are close to you and tell them you want to change. Ask them what it is you do that annoys them, and work on breaking the habit. Again, just getting out in the world and meeting new people as part of work or a club or something will be the best practice you can get. Try to go out and do something social at least 2-3 times a week. Even if it's awkward at first, practice and repetition will bring about change.  Dating- This is the last thing on my list because it will be the last thing you are ready for. I've listed this other stuff first because I believe that it is important to love and take care of yourself before you're ready to love and take care of another person. Relationships can't be forced, so you need to cut that possessive shit out. A relationship is an equal partnership, and you need to respect your partner as an individual with their own free will. Besides that, just don't use creepy, medieval language when talking to women, be a good listener, and encourage her hobbies and aspirations. Whenever you feel spaghetti about to come spilling out, just remember Samuel L. Jackson's advice in Pulp Fiction; ""Be cool."" Sometimes, this might involve keeping your mouth shut.    I hope that helped OP! I'm very excited for you; you've cast off the fedora that was enslaving you and have taken your first step into a larger world. Please keep us updated and know we are here to help"
neckbeardstories,2wqug1,DocSporky510,1 point,Sun Feb 22 19:14:41 2015 UTC,"Cardio should be done 4x week- for 20-30 min, at a rate where you can't actually talk to someone. I would include, get some used weights- hand ones good to start. Start progressive weight training ( google that, young man ) - and you will not only lose fat but gain muscle, which burns more calories.  Later on, you can work more on weights to get fit, and look leaner. Maybe even become a hottie! Its up to you. You don't need great interpersonal skills to lift."
neckbeardstories,2wqug1,odileLee,8,Mon Mar 9 06:25:42 2015 UTC,"Are you looking for a negative label for yourself?  You shower and brush, that is a good start.  Do your fucking laundry and only wear clean clothes.  Your hobbies are fine, find someone who also is into your hobbies.  My best friend is 400+ lbs, loves sci-fi, board games, video games, and role playing games and has no problem finding girls to be in a relationship with.    As for your way of speaking and communicating with others, pick up the book How to Win Friends and Influence people.  Before I read that I was in the same boat you were in.  Also, chill out, ask how you annoy people and train yourself to correct your issue.  If they are willing to tell you that talking to you annoys them then fucking ask them to tell you why.  When you gain that knowledge then you know what you need to work on.  Grow a pair/vulva and correct yourself.  As for your hobby of creating artificial languages, look up Loglan and Logban, you may have a bright future as a linguist.  Don't waste your gift, go to school.  If you can't afford school join the military.  You will learn self confidence, hygiene, and the ability to get along with others.  You can guarantee language school in your contract.  When you get out the military will pay for college, books, and a stipend to live on when you go to college or job school.  As for your problem with women; repeat after me ""Women are just people . . . they have the same wants and desires as men.""  Just chill out.  When you feel all obsessive and needy just play some video games, read a bit, or polish up some syntax on a language you are making.   Anything to distract you for about an hour or two.  DO NOT DRINK DURING THIS TIME, you will regret it.  If you have a female friend ask her to give you dating advice.  Whatever you do stay away from the redpill manosphere bullshit.  If you have any questions PM me.  I've been in the same boat you've been in and I'd like to help you get out of it."
neckbeardstories,2wqug1,unusuallytallgnome,3,Sun Feb 22 14:43:13 2015 UTC,"you got very good tips here, just let me add one thing - do you wash your clothes the right way? Sometimes BO doesn't really come out if you aren't doing it right. For example - 1. is the washing machine clean? 2. If you have a dryer, is that one clean? 3. do you use enough detergent?  if you have problems with BO you should def. change clothes daily!"
neckbeardstories,2wqug1,anesthesiologist,3,Sun Feb 22 11:45:06 2015 UTC,"Great job admitting you have a problem. I have a few pieces of advice for you    Temp jobs: These are really amazing ways to enter back into the workforce. Go to a local temp agency. Wear a nice suit, make sure you showered that morning, AND shave. This would provide you with both some income and a much needed confidence boost.  The BO Thing: Go to a doctor. Get prescription deodorant. Also, make sure you're washing your clothes and bed sheets often. These can contribute to ass bo smell.  Being a virgin: It's not a super big deal. When you meet the right person and they reciprocate, it will happen.  The weight: Start with just walking a few times a day. You say you like video games, if you have a WII get some of their exercise programs. That way you do not have to go to a gym and can exercise in your house.  Speak with your parents. Tell them you want to change."
neckbeardstories,2wqug1,hopessilverlight1890,2,Sun Feb 22 17:20:46 2015 UTC,"Agree on the doctor, and a dentist maybe? There may be a medical reason why you smell despite brushing/showering regularly. I know there are various gum-related issues that can cause bad breathe despite brushing for example. And toss the clothes and buy new ones! Not only does dressing better help your esteem and appearance, BO can get ingrained in fabric despite washing."
neckbeardstories,2wqug1,LAXAsh,3,Mon Feb 23 01:29:00 2015 UTC,"Social behavior: I had a lot of the same problems you're describing when it came to social interaction. I couldn't pick up on cues and the way I spoke to others never came off right.  This changed when I plunged myself into social situations in college. I was no longer the shut-in and socially awkward person that I was because I took the time to practice and learn through experience.   Let me just say that a smile goes a looooong way. I realized I put people off at the get-go with my ""resting bith face"" and adjusted how others percieved me. This had helped me tremendously in being approachable.   Then, I tried zoning in on auditory and idiosyncratic tendencies that I did myself, but in other people. For example, like when I was annoyed and didn't want to talk to someone I would half answer and not really pay attention or make eye contact. I would cue in on this in other people. This helped me to realize to tone it down or cut the conversation short so as to give the person some space. If they wanted to interract with me later, cool. If not, cool.  All of this helped me to develop empathy which I think is essential in human interractions and have made all of my social dealings more enjoyable. I love interracting with new people now.  Practice!"
neckbeardstories,2wqug1,123chico,2,Wed Feb 25 06:42:18 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend getting to know some new people. Whether that includes joining a gym, spending time with friends of friends you haven't met before, or looking for MeetUp groups about things you're interested in is up to you. I think having some others around with different perspectives would be great for you, and would enable you to practice managing your problems and working on your social skills with people you might not have to see again.

""Admitting your problem is the hardest part to fixing your problem"" I do commend you for nutting up and swallowing your pride enough to say these things about yourself. But change is very, very difficult. In many ways, it's harder than admitting. Often, admission just takes a moment of clarity, a moment where the defences you've built around your psyche are weakened. And suddenly things are a bit more clear.  Change, however, requires choice. And it's not just a choice you make once. You don't say ""I choose to work out/diet/improve"" because you have to keep making that choice every single day. In some ways, change is similar to a drug addict kicking the habit. Familiarity is frighteningly comfortable; if you aren't careful, you might not even actually do anything.  Be vigilant, and make the hard choice when you don't want to. If it were easy, everybody would do it!"

I have studied diets for 25 years ( by self, as I couldn't go to Uni because of ADHD ) so I KNOW when I recommend this one as the ONLY safe, easy, fast and best way.   Read up  the internet site ""The Return of Kings."" This will help you avoid a type of manipulative woman, while spotting the nice ones. Also, man you up, so to speak.  Im a gym instructor cert2. with ADHD- and I will tell you this, its not supposed to be enthralling. Its hard work, and you will be bored shitless. Use podcasts or something to educate yourself, while you work out.  Foodwise, once you get weight sorted, and understand Dukan- cut out the junk. Once a week have a snack day. I usually have my binge day every three weeks, where I make waffles and eat as much as I like. Then back to regular eating.  Clothes, try adding some eucalyptus oil to your wash. It deodorises.   Sweating- understand that what you put in your body, come sour someway, and sweating out junk food, coffee, etc will make you smell. Try eating parsley, or taking liquid chlorophyll. It will help your breath. Cut out lots of dairy as well. This is a common culprit.  Weird personality issues. What can I tell you, from someone who was a enormous freak for most of her life ( before, finally meds/best therapist ever! about 2.5 years ago fixed me up quite a lot.)  I tell you this, a good therapist who understands you, and you like- is the best way.

There are some with whom it's no use trying to remain friends. At the end of the last story, everyone should have severed contact with him then and there.  He's the one who fucked up, and he should be the one trying to earn your trust. Maintaining contact despite his shitty behavior is only enabling his shitty behavior.  As for this particular member of the Fedora Federation and his re-emergence,  the debate incident should've been enough for you to sever contact. Send a ""please, do not contact me again - ever"" message, then systematically block / disable every single method he has of reaching you. Deactivate and reactivate your own if you must and give your info only to your friends.  TL;DR: Dealing with this neckbeard requires severing all contact in a scorched earth/no-mercy type of fashion."

neckbeardstories,2wievm,NeckbeardDestroyer,14,Fri Feb 20 20:18:11 2015 UTC,Well that escalated quickly.  Coming from another former competitive chess player girls who play chess are cool. It's just hard on women because they get a lot of shit / harassed because guys who are into chess are (desperately) looking for a girl who is also into chess and into them but that's a very difficult thing to find.    Chess is fun. Men like women. Men who like chess like women who like chess more. Women who like chess are generally not into men who like chess.

One time I had a neckbeard at a tournament first ask me if I was at the right board (1st) and if I knew what openings were. I played the ditz card and said I didn't know. My good friend chimed in and said they were just stacking the boards and this was my first time, I picked up on it and asked the neckbeard how the ""horsey"" moved. Neckbeard and my friend spent the 10 minutes before the game started teaching me how the pieces moved. I beat the guy in about 10 moves and then gave him a lecture on how not to be an asshole. Almost crashed into a guy in a cape on my way out. High school chess was fucked."

Based also on your write-up, it could be argued that laziness is the defining attribute of neckbeardism. Intelligence and a superiority complex plays into it, in a ""large fish in a small pond"" manner.  Personally, I think it's the lack of self-awareness and/or an altruistic consideration of others that truly defines a neckbeard. Other traits make up key components (smugness, laziness, militant atheism, anime/MLP/gaming obsession, etc) but a keen sense of self-awareness will keep those qualities in check, limiting the sheer 'obnoxiousness' of the individual.  Think about it - you can be atheist but respectful of those of faith by not being constantly degrading or militant about it. You can like anime or video games with a passion, but understand that not everybody has the same appreciation you do. You can be lazy during your downtime, yet still retain an acceptable appearance in public, and so forth. Neckbeards will blather incessantly about their obsessions and ""achievements"", unsolicited, to any poor soul who has the ability to hear, as opposed to initiating conversation with small talk and reacting to the other individuals' input while monitoring for subtle clues on when the other parties are no longer interested.  In my opinion, for what it's worth, there's an emerging societal trend of embracing negative qualities and shunning self-improvement (those in the HAES movement, for example, who think that ""I'm alright with being fat"" = good health). Neckbeards see this, have latched on to it as a justification for their lifestyle: why bother to exercise when it's ok to be fat? Why bathe when you can drown yourself in Axe or demand must accept the ""au naturale"" lifestyle? Why bother paying attention to conversation when it's obvious that <insert random neckbeard obsession here> is the only thing that matters? BECAUSE THE WORLD DOES NOT REVOLVE AROUND YOU IS WHY"

The difference between a neckbeard and someone who is just plain nerdy is that horrible condescending and manipulative personality that comes with thinking you can do no wrong.

neckbeardstories,2wbuwt,lolwatzki,4,Sun Feb 22 15:41:25 2015 UTC,"This hits home. It's the first description of a neckbeard that I feel undeniably fits me. I'm an atheist who's obsessed with gaming, but I've never had a problem with those qualities, and find that many people besides neckbeards can say the same.  However, I am also morbidly lazy, overweight, have no real accomplishments, and can be found to give off an air of smugness, as I fancy myself of above-average intelligence (I feel a strong need to be of above average intelligence, and am filled with self-hatred at the slightest indication that I'm not). This makes me feel bad. People hate neckbeards with a passion, it seems.   The thing is, I don't want to be lazy and worthless, but it's simply too painful for me to not put in the bare-minimum; so, of course I'm going to be lazy. Of course I gain weight for being so lazy, and I never accomplish anything. Of course I try to escape with games, among other things; I look to the future, and the best I can see for myself is a job I don't hate and an apartment."

Obsession about single niche topics, and wanting to share it with others. Inability to comprehend social cues. Lack of a ""filter."" Greater interest in things than people. The ""neckbeard accent"" - overly precise, yet with odd pronunciation or emphasis of certain words. Strong interest in escapist hobbies and media.   Also consider that some elements of neckbeard/deep nerd culture -- MLP, Minecraft, and Sonic the Hedgehog -- are extremely popular among those with AS, for various reasons - clearly differentiated characters, facilitates escapism, easy categorization, etc.  TL/DR: some neckbeards may not be made, but rather born that way."

Went through the typical stages of grief, came to terms with it, and since then have made an effort to become a better person in spite of it.  It must work because whenever I get comfortable enough around someone to tell him/her I'm on the AS they don't believe me at first.  EDIT: The thing that ""fixed"" me (or at least led me on the path to self-betterment) was a healthy dose of self-awareness. What these people need is a wake-up call of some kind.

neckbeardstories,2wbuwt,I_trip_over_hurdles,7,Wed Feb 18 22:38:10 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% with saying neckbeards always find simple, lazy ways to feel superior to others. If there was a DSM entry for neckbeardism, that would be one of the main criteria. But I only agree partially with saying they have a sense of superiority and self-importance, just because I believe for most of them, its a false sense of superiority and self-importance. As if its not something they truly believe about themselves (although I'm not denying there are still plenty who are really that full of themselves), but instead something they're trying to convince themselves is true about themselves; all of this stemming from an inferiority complex and/or anxiety. And I'm basing all this mostly on myself.  Now, I would never say I'm a neckbeard now, or at any other point in my life. But I will say I've had some tendancies and thoughts, especially in the past, that are very similar to typical neckbeard qualities. Thank God pretty much all of them were only slight, and never extreme, mostly because I was usually too anxious to actually act on them, and probably because I knew deep down somewhere that it wasn't right. The only one I could say was severe enough to warrant concern was this sense that I was not only different, but better than most others because I was different. In fact, that was probably the only thing that put me at risk for becoming a neckbeard, and was responsible for most, if not all, the other tendencies I had.  Did I really think I was better than practically everyone else because I was different? Looking back on it, no. I've only realized this in the past couple years or so, but really it was all a defense mechanism to deny that I couldn't get through life and get everyone to like me by simply being myself. That it would take effort and mistakes to get that to happen. Was I afraid of effort? No. Was I afraid of mistakes? Yes. Not just mistakes, but embarrassing myself, or not feeling good enough for people even when I put in all the effort I knew how. Granted, I know these are things everyone is afraid of, more so when we're younger, but it always had such a crippling effect on me to the point where I just didn't know how to handle it. So I told myself ""You're just different from them because you're better. If you tried to get them to like you, you would be betraying your true self. They are they way they are because they're just trying to be something they're not so they can fit in"".   And it worked, sadly. Couple this with my extreme fear of being judged, regardless if I was being judged for trying or actually being myself, and you have someone who's only confident in staying in their own bubble.  Thankfully that bubble only lasted a few years. When I was 15, I met a guy in driver's ed who I became fast friends with thanks to our similar game interests, and through him I've met plenty of people who I'm still friends and hang out all the time with today. And when I think about it, that was probably the main thing that kept me from putting me further into neckbeard territory, so I guess I should thank him for that.   Its done next to nothing for my social anxiety or inferiority complex though, both of which are enemies I've finally been facing with head on the past few years. And its because of that 'battle' that I've realized a lot of these things about myself, and am able to more or less understand a lot of things about people like this. I was lucky to have whatever I had that kept me from getting worse and gave me the realization that they weren't characteristics worth keeping. But these other people haven't reached that point, and some never will. Hell, I never considered myself a neckbeard at all, and even then its been one hell of a struggle to break from these habits. Given that, its no wonder these other people are in the cycle they're in. And as much as I want to feel disgust toward them, I really end up just feeling sad.  TL;DR: My inferiority complex and social anxiety created my neckbeard qualities. I'm sure its the same for many others."

neckbeardstories,2wbuwt,odileLee,3,Thu Feb 19 14:25:31 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, but to add to your comments, I believe the trend begins very, very early in life. I'm a parent now, and I can almost pick out which young kids are going to have a predilection toward neckbeardism, and I think it's a trend on the uprise.   Root cause is overcoddling as a very young kid. It starts when the toddler falls trying to walk, and the mommy picks him up to comfort him, every time, instead of letting him learn to pick himself up and try again. Probably the mother keeps him at home or has a nanny rather than daycare where the kid can get hurt.  A few years later it turns into ""those boys at school just don't understand you! Just wait until ____ school, then you'll be with mature kids."" Or worse yet, ""they're just jealous because you're so {smart, handsome, talented, etc.}."" Lots of reinforcement about how special he is, but absolutely no effort toward getting him with other kids.   Probably around grade school, the kid already believes he really is the greatest - why not? It's what everyone has told him. He never really learned how to develop those social skills, and regularly gets ""bullied"". Not discounting actual bullying, I'm talking about the way kids joke and try to mess with each other, which to someone with no social skills can be seen as bullying. He likely has few friends, except at the lowest common denominator - people who share an exact interest in a certain hobby or something.   Now, puberty. He's full on hormone raging average pubescent kid, but doesn't know how to express it. He never learned how to talk to girls, never figured out how to properly transition from ""cooties"" to ""hotties"", and mixes it all up. Because he was never made to leave his comfort zone, he probably does not even try to talk to them. After all, he's pretty great, so they should be lining up to talk to him, right? The end result is that none of the girls can really be all that great, since they can't see his greatness and pounce on it.  I think from here it takes on the typical course, and it's easier to see how a teenager transitions into full neckbeardism. No girls and easy access to internet means those hormones are channeled into false representations of what a ""relationship"" is, and the kid's mind gets further warped. He may start doing poorly in classes, because he stays up late playing video games or posting in forums with other people just like him (all competing to make sure everyone knows they're the smartest!)  At any of these stages, a simple intervention would have led another way. For the toddler, it's letting him solve his own problems, and realizing he's not going to break. For the child, it's about encouraging him to make friends and explaining that he can never change other people, but can always change himself. For the adolescent, it's about learning to talk to the opposite gender, and realizing they're sort of a ""separate but equal"" kind of person - you don't have to tiptoe around girls, but you can treat them as equals and yet still appreciate the natural beauty they're starting to transition toward. For the teenager, it's about getting off the dang computer and developing a work ethic - treating school like a job, knowing relationships are important, maybe even holding an actual part time job rather than getting plenty of weekly income from mommy. If it goes to college, I fear it's too late. I've never really witnessed a transition at this point, but suppose it could happen.  Overall, guess which parent is more likely to force these things - fathers. I would declare the root cause of neckbeardism as a nonexistent or weak father. Mothers want to take care of and protect their children, and it takes a good father to create the proper balance. Good mothers nurture, good fathers create solid character. This takes effort at every stage in life. It's no surprise that a father's lack of work ethic in parenting will represent itself equally in a teenager's lack of work ethic to become a real man."

I'd say I probably was a ""child neckbeard"" in a lot of ways. I didn't have a Dad until my mom married when I was 7. My mom was definitely the coddling, unconditional love type, but my step-dad took me under his wing. He let me be my nerdy self, but it wasn't too late for him to teach me not to be a self-absorbed asshole. Not to say mom's can't be tough as nails too, but if you have a doormat mom and no dad, therefore letting the kid run the show, neckbeard crisis is imminent. Thinking back to all my beardiest friends they've all had single mothers or have been from a ""see dad every other weekend"" kind of home."
neckbeardstories,2wbuwt,odileLee,1 point,Wed Feb 18 19:54:20 2015 UTC,"I had my own neckbeard tendencies, but a good dad. Despite some health issues that made it hard for me to do traditionally ""boy"" things like sports (he still laments giving me a choice of a baseball glove or microscope one birthday), he encouraged my going out and tromping through the woods, making friends of the neighbor boys, knowing how to talk to girls, holding down a job, etc. I think that given my natural personality and how I feel about the world/people, I might have eventually gone full neckbeard if it weren't for my parents having a bigger perspective on life than making their kids comfortable.  I do hate to boil it down to just a father issue, but personal experiences do seem to point that way. I know some single moms that have clearly adapted and do great at the father role, but I'd say it's not always the natural case, nor should it be. I think a boy should have a mom he can be comforted by, just that he also needs a good dad to show him how to grow up."
neckbeardstories,2wbuwt,odileLee,1 point,Wed Feb 18 20:17:33 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of it comes down to having too much of a good thing. Having criticism in one's life is a good thing, but having a shoulder to cry on it a good thing as well. Sometimes people don't know how to be both for a person and the stereotype and tradition would be that Dad handles being critical while Mom offers comfort. Without Mom there, Dad might go overboard and give the kid a self-esteem deficit. Without Dad there, you get a neckbeard who needed to be told there's always room for improvement. Without getting too political, I'd say there's single moms and dads who can fill both of those niches and gay couples who can raise a well rounded kid. Hell there's probably plenty of people who just have enough self-awareness to not grow the beard."

Autism/Aspergers spectrum probably has some decent overlap with Neckbeardism, as does ADD, I'd imagine. Both of those can definitely lead to people who don't really understand how they're being perceived by others, just because of how their brain works. But despite physiological causes, having an echo chamber where many people tell you how great you are all the time can lead to the same situation - why have self-awareness when you're constantly being reinforced about how great you are? Combine all of the above, and ... whew.   Either way, this is why we complement our kids on how hard they work, or how good their behavior is, things like that. None of that ""you're so smart"" or ""look how much better you are than that kid"", etc. And if they need care for a condition like ADD/ASD, I'll be first in line to fight for what they need to cope with the world around them.  Congrats on losing the fedora! I think many of us on these types of subs are in similar places - reformed or close-call neckbeards who like to hear what it's like so that we keep straying away from it!

I also didn't date until I was 17 and it was awkward as fuck starting out.   I actually studied psychology in college and it's infuriating how many people stop taking their meds or take their kids off their meds for stuff like that.

My own may I add ), and relatively stable, mentally - is from hard work in the face of overwhelming odds.( Put it this way, my therapist told me, even a ""normal"" person would have a mental breakdown at the issues your facing. )  Its what you put into yourself, that counts. Marcus Aurelius wrote a good diary about what it was to be a good man, in the face of adversary. ( In fact, although the most powerful man in the world, at that time, who could have ANYTHING, what he sorrowed over, was not enough time to read. How profound!)"

neckbeardstories,2wbuwt,FatMidAgeMagnet,2,Thu Feb 19 08:54:19 2015 UTC,"My grandfather used to say that bullying was God's way of telling you to work on your social skills. I fit the pre-neckbeard stereotype when I was young - gifted, arrogant, everything came easily - but after a couple of years (grades 5-6 in particular) of being bullied, I learned enough social skills and humility to fit in, and wound up being (I hope) a well-adjusted teenager, had good friends and girlfriends, etc. I'm not sure I'd credit the bullying for anything, it was hell on earth, but the happy side effect of it was having the neckbeard beaten out of me before allowing it to metastasize as a teenager.   Part of the point of school is learning soft skills like how to socialize with other people with whom you have nothing in common, and putting smart kids on a pedestal teaches them that they don't have to learn to get on with the peasants."
neckbeardstories,2wbuwt,PlausibleSarge,7,Mon Mar 9 08:07:02 2015 UTC,Most of the people who were bullied that i have known had medical conditions/family situations that made them stand out. Certainly poor social skills don't help but bullying should not be justified like this.

neckbeardstories,2wbuwt,FinnSven,2,Thu Feb 19 14:06:32 2015 UTC,"My grandfather used to say that bullying was God's way of telling you to work on your social skills.    Interesting quote.  Not all bullying is related to social skills; a lot is related to physical disability, being poor, being rich, being un-athletic, and other things they have no control over.  Still, I'm guessing many otherwise self-aware children and adults are at a total loss as to why they're being bullied or shunned.  Many probably know they're something wrong with the way they present themselves to the world.  They might want to fix what they're doing wrong, but they're clueless as to what exactly needs fixing, and rules of decorum keep others from telling them.  Consider how we (at least in the United States) struggle with others that have body odor; just as stinking up your surroundings is socially unacceptable, so is telling someone they really need to take a fucking shower and wash their clothes.   It's either brute-force cruelty or polite tolerance, neither of which are very useful.     Also consider the stories of socially inept men and women who ask ""what did I do wrong?"" or ""why didn't you like me?"" after yet another unsuccessful date.   Many mock it, but it's a sign that someone is painfully aware they're lacking in some area that makes one attractive to the appropriate sex.  They just don't know what it is, and they're desperate to find out.  PUA is a band aid for the dating challenged, but the real challenge is finding the wound and treating it for good."

neckbeardstories,2wbuwt,upvotetown,1 point,Sat Feb 21 04:36:40 2015 UTC,"I know this won't be popular, but as I have said elsewhere, there are Neckbeard traits to be found even in ""Laddish"" guys.  For the Septics, I think that your closest equivalent is ""Bro"", but perhaps someone with a deeper cross pond knowledge could correct me.  Laddish types, I would say at the extreme end are Football hooligan types, and at the soft end, your average bar hanging Joe.   Blue collar,from semi skilled trades to desk jockey corp drones, found in bars and pubs most weekends and evenings, they like sport and watch it in bars. Maybe take in a game at the stadium too.  But yes, amongst these guys, you can find much of the same kind of logic, especially when women are concerned.   Women who are not interested in them, well the fault is always the woman's, even if they are an overweight balding ugly bastard who never washes his nylon/polyester sport team shirt.  They will approach women in aggressive, sexist, rude, patronising ways, and be puzzled why that approach does not work.   They can be found with the same kind of Arrogant self importance, especially if they are known to be hard, or have a solid group of violent friends. (More common specifically in hooligan types for obvious reasons)   They frequently have encyclopaedic knowledge of sports results, rules, players, etc, in an obsessive way to rival any Star Trek nerd.  A key difference though, is that it is not to hard for them to find like minded friends, and while a lot of their behaviour is highly anti social (Yes, some will kick shit out of people for things as innocent as drinking the wrong drink in the wrong pub.) they are very social and always in the company of others.  I am not saying that most ""normal"" guys are just neckbeards who don't like My Little Pony, I am saying that there are guys who would be paid up neckbeards amongst these groups. They just don't stand out, and find their neckbeardy traits covered up by just being arrogantly part of a group."

I couldn't build an entire house, but I can get a lot of it done. My dream job would be to make furniture or doors and windows in a small shop in the woods, working with my hands. My current favorite thing to watch on YouTube is lathe videos, I want a lathe!   I hate people who sneer at labor like that. It's what built this country - immigrants who brought their skills and knowledge of woodworking, stone work, brick work, and a work ethic that built skyscrapers. I bet that fedora pansy would have an emotional breakdown at the idea of unclogging a toilet, or getting calluses on your hands from working with tools.   The hilarious thing is, he's probably an IT flunky who just pushes old monitors around on a trolley, and fumbles around setting up new equipment, until someone with real skills gets everything working. The really good IT workers I worked with in the past all had outside hobbies like woodworking, or gardening, or doing something with their hands, and took great pride and pleasure in it - because it's nice to have something you can touch and feel at the end of the day, when you walk out of the office, you can't stroke the code you wrote or admire the new monitor you installed, and get the same feeling of satisfaction."

Professional life is great and all and I know that's where I belong for my career but going back to your roots and doing blue collar work and making things as a hobby is always super fun and I don't think I would have it any other way.

How it works is that you can write your own will, but you can not write one for someone else without a license. But there are plenty of people that want professional advice about how to do their will (understandably), you just have to find them. So, I teamed up with this insurance agent and we put on these financial services seminars and people sign up with me through that. In addition to the wills I give people tax advice and just general financial counsel. So my job is quasi-sales, quasi-legal. I think that is how most legal positions are these days. Its not like it was in the past, but you can still make a decent living and help people out. Also my job is cool because I basically never have to go into the office or wear a suit. As long as I am not actively selling the wills, I can sit at home and switch off between mario kart, reddit and will writing, which is pretty decent.   I didn't even take wills in law school.

neckbeardstories,2vlaw4,HardwoodDeck,20,Wed Feb 11 23:20:50 2015 UTC,"Money? Chubby? Cocky? Man, she reminds of a girl I played poker with once.  The only stakes were bragging rights, but I'm a damn good poker player and I still wanted to enjoy myself a bit... so I like to play like there's real stakes. There's about 10 of us at the table, and most had never played before so I guess I was out of luck from the beginning.  However, she caught my (bad) attention because she did nothing except bluff out her ass the whole time. She wasn't even being subtle: if anyone stayed past the flop, she'd raise the bet by an absurd amount. Every. Single. Time. The rest of the table is very inexperienced, so they're pretty intimidated and she usually nets the blind... but it's like, at least fucking try. She was making the game frustrating and boring as shit.  Anyways, I start getting irritated, so I decide to start hustling a little bit. Making some obvious bad moves, and getting her head even bigger. I was doing well, so I had extra chips to make mistakes. She starts teasing me about ""I thought you were gonna be good"".  Anyways, at one point I'm holding Aces of Cloves and Jack of Cloves. I stay in.The flop: King of Cloves, Queens of Cloves, Ten of Hearts (so close!). I knew it was my moment (obviously), so I raise. Then she raises, trying to scare me off. I raise again, etc. It continues until she decides to go all in to scare me off, so I go all in (unfortunately I couldn't match, but might as well). Her hand? One pair... on the river (I'm pretty sure it was a pair of 8s).  Needless to say, she declared that she was bored of poker and wanted to do something else. But damn, taking that huge pile of worthless chips has never felt so satisfying."

At first I wrote ""clubs"" and then was like ""nah, that doesn't feel right... it must be cloves. It's a clover."" I'm fluent and have practically no accent (unless you listen real close to my Cs and Zs), but every once in a while I get my wires crossed.  tl;dr It was Spanglish. In Spanish you say ""Rey de Treboles"", which translates to ""King of Clovers""."

If they were maybe involved in his life a bit more while he was growing up and taught him how to keep himself clean and together, and how to interact people, maybe he wouldn't have lived such a lonely existence.

neckbeardstories,2va5lu,lolwatzki,75,Mon Feb 9 14:05:26 2015 UTC,"It may just be me, but there seems to be something off with males who excessively use female avatars/imagery.  I mean, I get the logic concerning video games/MMOs/etc - it's usually focused around aesthetics or a curiosity with ""the other side"".  When it comes to anything that can be directly connected to you as an individual... again, something seems off about the excessive use of the other gender's imagery/identity.  I mean, judging by the FB uploads and this post in general, we have a straight male more or less self-identifying with female imagery. He then wonders why he's having dating issues.  I'm no expert on women, I'll readily admit that. Neither am I a red pill-er. Yours truly is a former neckbeard who somehow managed to convince a young lady to spend the rest of her life with me. Women who are worth spending time with (i.e., aren't legbeards or flat-out crazy) aren't attracted to neckbeards. My advice for this beardling (whenever he gets out of trouble) and others for exorcising the euphoria, for what it's worth, would be:   take pride in your appearance. Bathe daily, utilize deodorant. Lightly utilize cologne/body spray (protip: if you use Axe, the time it takes to say the word ""axe"" when you spray - that's the proper amount to use). Don't obsess over it, but be mindful that your daily ""maintenance"" is the image of you that your project throughout the day; if life is a video game, your appearance is your avatar. If you can still see your skin underneath your beard after 2 months or so, you are incapable of growing a beard. Either go clean-shaven or style it into something with what does grow in thick. Likewise, unless its long enough to pull back, cut your damn hair. If you're heavy-set, cut your damn hair anyway. Long hair does not look good on us fatties. be confident in yourself and your abilities, but also realize there's always room for improvement - denial of this is arrogance. Remember that there will always be someone better than you. Learn to dress properly: lose the fedora/trillby. Lose the trench coat, too, unless it's the middle of winter and windy outside. Lose the fingerless gloves. Flame button-ups are acceptable only if you're a game developer or a classic car/hot rod enthusiast. Make sure your clothes are clean and wrinkle-free. If you have a stain/spot, rewash. If it doesn't come out, you don't wear that article in public. pick up a hobby that doesn't involve sitting in front of a screen. Personally, I like to customize/restore old wooden fixtures (clocks, knife blocks, jewelry boxes, etc). There's something liberating about getting into the rhythm and more or less ""automatically"" working - especially if you overthink and second-guess yourself constantly.  cease the passive-aggressive crap. If someone is giving you Hell, bring it to their attention. Always strive to work out a mutual agreement but realize some people will only respond to violence. If it comes to that, only strike after they take their swing. Learn to fight (yes, without the beloved katana or any other weapon). on the topic of fighting, don't be afraid to get your ass whooped. Often times, taking a stand for what is right and taking the abuse that comes with it is more important than the blows themselves. be honest, courteous, and professional in all your affairs. This does not mean be cold, calculating, or unapproachable. If you give your word on something, follow through with it. Go out of your way to help your fellow (hu)man if your assistance is needed/asked for, even if it's someone you may not personally like or agree with.   </endrant> steps off soapbox"

Even fewer when it comes to words anonymously posted on the internet. I've posted before in other places, it usually takes a gut-wrenching reality check and a long, hard, look in the mirror to force the throatpubes to withdraw and send the fedora scurrying away like the headcrab it is.  The above points come from personal experience, after seeing the neckbeard I was destined to become in the reflection of a former close friend (think Empire Strikes Back when Luke ""encounters"" Vader in the darkness and decapitates him, only for the mask to burn away and reveal Luke's face).

neckbeardstories,2va5lu,MayorOfLoquest,10,Tue Feb 10 00:02:02 2015 UTC,"Pointless. These guys don't think there's a problem with the way they act, and the hygiene thing is just a tip of the iceberg. You can't ""fix"" a neckbeard, they have to want to change - they need that epiphany, at rock bottom, that their life just isn't working right, and they need to change. Some never do. Their denial and delusion is probably stemming from borderline or outright NPD or BPD, and there's no ""fix' for that.  This kid? I found him, using your clues. He's a psychopath, in the real definition of the term. He exhibits some of the same ""victimhood"" of Elliott Roger, who killed a bunch of people in LA - and like him, physically attacked a woman as ""revenge"". That's psychopath territory. The only way he's escaping a long jail term is to get committed, and if that happens...who knows how long he'll be in the system.  I hate to paint with a broad brush, but it's getting to the point that if I see a post or profile with Ponies and anime characters, and it's female characters when it's clear it's a guy - I avoid any contact with them, and assume they're a liability in one way or another. If you're a brony, and think you're harmless, it's on you to prove that. Sorry. That culture is stuffed to the gills with the weird, the outcasts, and the crazies. It's not normal for an adult male to identify with and sexualize cartoon ponies, and surround themselves with them. It's creepy as fuck. It's not healthy. And more and more of them, as they get older, are becoming a problem. It's way worse than red pill, they're channeling their sexual identity and lives into cartoons. That's I think signs of a mental disorder. They've given up on healthy, rewarding relationships to cartoons, much like an alcoholic gives up their lives for the booze.  If I see avatars in forums that are ponies, you go straight onto the ignore/block list. Sorry. If I see MPP names, slogans, nicknames, or references, same."
neckbeardstories,2va5lu,lolwatzki,2,Mon Feb 9 21:59:35 2015 UTC,I agree.   My brother pretends to be a girl online.
neckbeardstories,2va5lu,MayorOfLoquest,1 point,Wed Feb 11 14:46:53 2015 UTC,"By ""online"", do you mean he has a female video game character (or two, or three) and RPs as such, or is he like the neckbeard in OP's post where nearly everything is female imagery (such as using the term ""bitch mode"" when stating he's going to try to be more assertive/aggressive and the obvious cleavage of ""chaos"" in the ""chaos/kindness"" image)?  Like I said in the other comment, I ""get it"" when it comes to stuff like MMOs and whatnot - I, personally, have a couple of Warcraft characters that are female (priest[ess] and druid), although I don't take it as far as to actively RP as the opposite sex. I understand the concept and allure of overly-sexualized high-fantasy aesthetics concerning the female form. It usually boils down to ""hurr durr boobs"". For some, it's about perceived gender ""roles"" in a fantasy setting: generally, males are seen as more physical/brutish (think sword-n-shield melee) whereas females are seen as more lithe and intellectual (think caster and/or stealth classes). As always, there are exceptions to the rule but this is how I think most online gamer mindsets are.  Anything that can be directly linked to you as an individual, in my opinion, is by its very nature a projection and extension of your person. NOT just your mind/intellect, NOT just your heart/soul, NOT just your physical appearance, but all of the above. Take pride in who you are and don't try to be who you are not."

neckbeardstories,2va5lu,lolwatzki,-1,Tue Apr 21 06:46:20 2015 UTC,"Just because someone identifies with a character of the opposed gender it doesn't mean that they have gender issues, people are more than their dicks/vaginas, they can have other personality traits. Besides, the guy might be using a female avatar or pic just because he thinks it's cute, it's like if you put the picture of a cat in a social media as your profile pic, it doesn't mean that you're having race issues, like you wish to be a cat, it just means you think that the pic is cute. And I also don't see a problem with someone spending their whole day in front of a computer, you can do so much stuff with a computer, you can study any subject and learn about anything. Besides, as our society becoming more and more automated every day, learning how to program, for example, is going to become a necessity. And don't take this wrong, but learning how to do stuff with wood is NOT a ability that will help you much in real life, learning any computing ability (coding, editing video, dealing with software) is probably going to be more useful. I get if you do that for fun, but don't go getting too proud of that, there's not much you can do with it."
neckbeardstories,2va5lu,mrtrotskygrad,2,Fri Feb 13 02:20:38 2015 UTC,"Not sure if trolling or serious. I'll assume you're actually being serious.  TL;DR: Obsessions lead to trouble, sitting extensively is bad for your health, and your personal attack is laughible - physical labor will always be in demand because people either don't want to work with their hands or don't know how to work with them.  You're right - there are more to people than their genetalia. However if you reread my comment, I said that the issue stems from extensively and obsessively utilizing the imagery. I even said that I understand the concept behind rolling an opposite gender character for gaming purposes, etc.  There's a difference between appreciation and obsession, although apparently you don't see it. To use your example, no, there's nothing wrong with using a cat pic as a profile image. There is something wrong if you use nothing but cat pics for everything you post online (similar as to the neckbeard in question).   Never did I say there was anything wrong with working on a computer. What I suggested was to get away from the screen with a hobby that involves something physical. Sitting in front of a screen for 8-12 hours/day while at work or school and then another 4-8 hours at home is detrimental to your health - see Washington Post article here, infographic here, and another infographic here.  Personally, I work at a desk job all day where I study municipal blueprints and compile material lists for construction projects - it's very mentally taxing but the most physical activity I get is going up and down a single flight of stairs (13 steps to be exact) when I need to use the restroom or raid the company fridge (unspoken rule is if you bring anything in, you've got 3 days to consume it before it becomes fair game). When I get home, I don't really want to do anything but vegetate in front of the TV (Top Gear ftw) or pointlessly grind away on WoW - but I don't. I get home, change, and work on whatever project I have going on at the time.  Yes, the TV is on - but as background noise. Yes, I still get on the computer occasionally - but to check in with friends and review the news. Off days are devoted to running errands (groceries, bills, laundry, house upkeep, etc) and while there is some vegetation (read: sitting) time, it's usually minimal - long enough to check news feeds and maybe grind out a level in WoW on some random alt.  As for your absurd personal attack against me, my hobby, my appreciation for manual labor, and trade skills in general- there will always be a market for hand-crafted items (the prices here attest to this).  There will always be a market for trade skills - in fact, a good trade can be fairly lucrative: yes, the world is becoming increasingly automated but think practically - when your pipes freeze and burst or your water heater goes out, you'll call a plumber to repair it. When your vehicle won't start, you'll take it to a mechanic, and so forth. Unless you plan on renting your entire life or constantly house-hopping every time you wish to change your home's appearance (such as cabinetry, wall layout, etc), I strongly suggest you learn to do some things yourself. If not, don't worry, there will always be somebody, somewhere willing to do the dirty work for you - for a price. Whether or not you can afford it will be a different story. In short, there's a lot, actually that can be done with physical labor and trade skills (woodworking included), and I'm damn proud of it.  That above rant aside, I'm guessing you've either never worked with your hands before or if you have, it's been a very long time. There's always something extra in an object you've physically put forth effort in creating versus buying something that's been mass-produced (again, since your argument boils down to trade skills are pointless), I mean take a look over at /r/DIY or /r/woodworking and observe the pride that comes from creating an object yourself. It's even better when it's a hobby - you're creating these masterpieces in your spare time. Figure also that the raw or base materials can be purchased for next to nothing compared to what the final value of the item would be. Even if I refuse to sell anything I create, I still have the added benefit of being able to stretch my dollar further - you'd be surprised how far a new coat of paint, a little restaining, or just some TLC can go in making old items new again.  Edit: If you were to hire a contractor to construct any of the outdoor work seen on /r/DIY, count on paying for the cost of materials + 10% to 15% markup + hourly labor + 10% to 20% markup on materials & labor for overhead costs (admin fees, etc), + an additional 10% or on that number for profit. $500 in materials and 8 hours worth of labor becomes around $810 (figuring labor @ $15/hr, actuality in my field is around $25/hr) at cheapest and over $1,000 on the high end. Meanwhile, if you did it yourself, you'd be out only the $500 in materials and a few hours of your time.  To illustrate the difference between mass production vs handmade another way: what sounds more delicious- a hamburger from McDonald's, or one you've made yourself (by ""made"", I mean YOU ground/minced the meat and YOU made the bun/roll from scratch). Yes it's more labor-intensive but the results are worth it. I'm sure most anybody would take a handmade, homemade burger over a Big Mac any day of the week.   I understand that the world is becoming more and more automated, and I even agree with you that learning to program and keeping up with such trends is a useful talent. I see how 3D printing and Rapid Prototyping are becoming cheaper and cheaper along with other manufacturing innovations. Yes, I see a future coming where you'll be able to ""download"" a chair, table, desk, or even automobile and have your 3D printer make one for you. That being said, the appeal of such will never match that of a similar item that's been carefully constructed by hand.   There's more to life than 1's and 0's. There's more to our existence than electrons flowing through a circuit. There's other things to enjoy besides staring at a screen all day. You are NOT just your mind, nor your body, but a combination thereof. Be physical with your life - you'll get much better results."

neckbeardstories,2v0j4k,SomeBroadYouDontKnow,1 point,Tue Mar 10 08:42:15 2015 UTC,"Rape is a act of aggression/violence, not sex- per se.  This type of disorder causes a lack of filtering, which most people assume. They feel no remorse, or shame, or worry at committing crime, aggressive acts, or violence. The problem on the meta level, is rape is a crime of violence, but it is a fantasy of sex.  This means, the two can get confused by some/but remembering, just because someone thought about it, doesn't mean they thought they were going to GET it. Primarily, this is what causes some of the split in determining the causes of rape/how to prevent it. The main issue, is that nothing we teach or try to prevent, will change that sex and aggression, have had strange links thru history. Indeed, in mammals - other mammals, strong links. This makes it difficult to rationalise, what is the cause. This is not going to be a easy solve for anyone, at this point of man's evolutionary time. ( Sorry if I sound very vague. Ive been pondering this, have read much on it, very very varied sources, including biology, feminism, behavorial/interpersonal psych, psychology, history, etc. So it might sound rather random, but there isn't one clear answer here. This is why I advocate - know where you going, the dangers, understand the difference in mens brains from womens, also how people with problems may take seeing you in public. Ive gone out for 20 years, often alone, in bad places- and only when I did not take my own advice, did I get into serious trouble. )"

neckbeardstories,2uv0qx,HaroldTheSpineFucker,2,Sun Feb 15 17:55:09 2015 UTC,"The fact that the creator of a show isn't going to publicly alienate any part of the audience/people who buy the merchandise is to be expected and is pretty much meaningless.  Did the creator say that the secondary demographic is the parents of the kids who like the show or adults who watch it for themselves? Because  it makes sense to take the parents (both moms and dads) into consideration; they're going to be the ones buying so much of the merchandise for the kids and if watching the show makes them want to throw the TV out the window they're going to find other toys to buy instead. But I highly doubt that they're gearing the show to childless adults.  I didn't say I disliked it; it's a cute show for little kids, and I can see why little kids like it. But I can't understand why any adult would want to watch it for themselves."
neckbeardstories,2uv0qx,objection_overruled,-1,Sun Feb 15 19:37:17 2015 UTC,"This is what I am referring to  If you don't know why an adult would watch it, you could either watch the show yourself and figure out why you might want to watch it for yourself, or ask the community why they personally do.  Generally, it's quality animation and writing, and a lot of the people who worked on shows they liked as a kid work on the show now."
neckbeardstories,2uv0qx,polishgravy,3,Sun Feb 15 20:06:46 2015 UTC,"Again, the creator of any show wouldn't publicly alienate any of the people watching the show/buying the merchandise. I'm still it sure how you think that proves anything.   I did see the show with my niece once because she wanted to watch it. I still don't understand why adults want to watch it. The animation and writing were ok, but not amazing. Again, I can see how kids would be fans, but not adults."
neckbeardstories,2uv0qx,Lachwen,-1,Sun Feb 15 20:12:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sorry, forgot you said you watched it.   I mean, different people like different things for different reasons. I think you know why other people like it, but you don't personally see an appeal."
neckbeardstories,2uv0qx,polishgravy,3,Sun Feb 15 21:53:42 2015 UTC,"With most things, even if I can't see the appeal I can understand how other people do. With this, I can't understand how anyone who isn't a small child could be a fan."

neckbeardstories,2uv0qx,polishgravy,-35,Thu Feb 5 16:24:27 2015 UTC,How was I bullying? Just because most girls don't go for guys who are into that dumb show doesn't mean you need to get butthurt.

neckbeardstories,2umza9,BatMark,24,Tue Feb 3 16:10:22 2015 UTC,"My two cents: For some people (and from what I've seen, they tend to be folks who crave either sex or attention or both), they just can't fathom the fact that there are people who, in their eyes, are so ""desirable for sex"" to the point where they are having sex forced upon them unwillingly by others, while they get nothing. They just don't get the seriousness or gravity of it; how horrible it is. To them, being a victim of rape just means that you're really, really desirable, and nothing else.    I once heard an ex-friend (female, not quite legbeard but a ""bones are for dogs, men like meat"" type) berate a childhood friend of mine who was a victim of sexual assault that she should be ""flattered"" that men think she was ""pretty enough to rape"" and that she was ""lucky"" that she had someone who ""loved her enough to [rape her].""

I recently went on a date with someone who could be considered a Neckbeard and that's pretty much all of what our conversation consisted of. His ""edgy"" comments were about how Miley Cyrus was a slut even though this dude once slept with a girl just because he hated her boyfriend (for no reason I might add. The boyfriend was a bit of a dork but a genuinely nice guy), called Nicki Minaj ""Niggy Minaj"", and said that Rihanna must have done something to deserve getting beaten up by Chris Brown. He thought he was being funny and when I called him out he said he was just nervous."

neckbeardstories,2ujsmi,LEMON_PARTY_ANIMAL,49,Mon Feb 2 21:45:46 2015 UTC,"I agree that OP should have stepped in sooner, but don't be annoyed at the victim. Some people don't like making a scene or rocking the boat even when it's detrimental to them. Someone coming to their aid is embarrassing because it's hard to cope with feeling responsible for causing a scene (even when they aren't responsible).  I was kind of like that a long time ago, I got trapped in a conversation with a creeper. I was awkwardly locked in, unable to leave out of fear of being seen as rude, not wanting to cause a scene if he reacted negatively. My friends noticed and swooped in to save me without issue, which I was grateful for, but I can understand why the victim reacted how she did.  I'm much different now, but it's a really shitty headspace to be trapped in."

Once it became physical, she needed to make some noise, slap him, call him out on his shit. There's not always going to be other people there. People have to be responsible for their own safety.  I was totally like this too. I got harassed all the time on the street and subway and I took it. I took it. But after having my ass grabbed for the umpteenth time and realizing that no one else was going to help me (in the middle of a semi-busy subway car, no less), I decided to hell with this. Those people won't stop until you make them stop.   Of course, this guy is the scum of the Earth. He shouldn't have put her in that situation. He should have read her social cues better. He absolutely should not have touched her without her permission. He was willing to escalate unless someone stopped him.

I've been there. Why wouldn't you want to get away from that?  There's victim blaming and then there's taking responsibility for your own safety. No one else is going to look out for you. You won't always have someone step in and help. That's why I don't take my phone out on the subway anymore, because I've been robbed before. Someone can easily snatch it and run off.

You look at the typical neckbeard behavior, lumping people into cliques, obsessively gawking at everything with breasts, the ""edgy"" mind sets they develop...neckbeards are a product of a life trapped in their early teens. They never leave that restricted, warped, immature view of the world we all have when we're 16, and as a result, can't function properly when the real world comes calling. Given how much these people tend to be tormented in high school, you wonder why they're so keen to hang onto it."
neckbeardstories,2uex1l,jrshaul,8,Sun Feb 1 17:05:00 2015 UTC,"I'd say younger. In my class, growing up, the ""neckbeard"" types started splintering off around 7th grade, when social strata starts to become important, some kids go through growth spurts, develop bigger (like showering in gym with the kids with pubes, and those without...), get into sports, some deviate into band or art, and a couple of them are still 11-12, having sleepovers and giggling like little girls at the word ""tits"" and still think of girls as having cooties. They bond over D&D (these days video games and plastic ponies), and don't get involved in social activities like flirting, dating, going to dances, or sports events - they start to become social outcasts, and it only gets worse in High School, as everyone else is years ahead of them. They desire the more mature things teenagers indulge in - girls, partying, social lives, but they have no skills, and flounder around - and learn to use intelligence and boasting as shields from the harassment and teasing and mocking they get from their peers.   The internet only made it worse - it's an echo chamber for them, that how they are is ""normal"" - and they also got caught up in the manga/hentai/weeabo world, and learned the whole fedora thing.   I think they prefer a high school mentality, because in school, even with the torment, they're still in a bubble where the real world still hasn't kicked them in the nuts yet. They can get away with far more antisocial behavior there. It's when they leave high school, and enter college and the real world, is when they can get mean, as well - they don't have much control over their emotions, including anger.  (Which is why they freak out and get all idiotic over crushes - most people learn to deal with that in middle school and early high school, with the ageless learning to flirt dance.)   It's sad, but I don't waste much time on pity - they need a foot up their ass to grow the fuck up and get their shit together, and if they refuse - hey, it's your bed, you lie in it. You can't force someone to ""get"" it."

Even after reading all these stories I have no idea how you all put up with her for so long. She's selfish, manipulative, sociopathic, petty, mean-spirited, untrustworthy, unreliable, conniving, bratty, and just a generally unpleasant person. Childhood friends or no, I'd have been done with her after she dumped my clothes out on the balcony.  For what it's worth, I'm glad you purged her from your life finally."

neckbeardstories,2uex1l,MrDoctorSmartyPants,3,Tue Feb 3 03:41:04 2015 UTC,"After following this whole series, my armchair diagnosis for Amanda would not be autism/aspergers, as some have suggested, but full blown narcissistic personality disorder.  It would explain her delusions, her belief that people are always watching her/paying attention to her, expecting people to read her mind, laying down in the middle of things, and generally acting like the world owes them everything.  She surrounded herself with enablers and gradually drove even her mother away because she is unable to feel empathy or understand right from wrong.  I don't know if that would make her mom feel better or not...She didn't fail as a parent, her daughter probably has a severe personality disorder and not an easily treatable one at that.   Good luck with starting your own business! That's awesome!"
neckbeardstories,2uex1l,Lachwen,4,Tue Feb 3 05:45:53 2015 UTC,"Other people have suggested the same thing, and after a bit of reading, I think its pretty close to the truth."
neckbeardstories,2uex1l,AcephalousDreams,2,Tue Feb 3 15:50:17 2015 UTC,"Weighing in my secondary opinion, I think it would be difficult to pin the cause of her behavior on any one thing.  After reading through the chronicles, my thought is that she may have some mental disorder that went unchecked for too long, and she unconsciously began toeing the line of acceptable behavior. Over the years, this led to a stunted development of maturity, explaining her visions of grandeur and extremely childish reactions when things don't go her way. After a while, her extreme immaturity would be what she views as acceptable and even natural behavior, even though in reality it was barely bearable.  Of course there's also an extreme case of narcissism. In order to excuse her immaturity to others when called out on it, she would have to buff up her importance to others, or at the very least herself. It looks to me like she managed to convince herself that she was vastly more important than the people around her, meaning they had to accept her behavior. Given that early on her group was basically forced to accept how she acted, it made a permanent impression that everyone would accept her behavior, and those that didn't were just assholes."

neckbeardstories,2uex1l,this_clay_of_my_clay,2,Mon Feb 16 05:31:33 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate on how your brother is also your cousin? I'm awful with logic but does that make your parents siblings?
neckbeardstories,2uex1l,Tocor,3,Sun Feb 1 18:05:40 2015 UTC,"The whole story of whys etc is somewhat long, but he is my dad's brother's son.  After my uncle divorced, my aunt got custody of the kids.  While he was still little, she decided she didn't want to take care of him, so she basically dropped him off with his father.  My uncle was not in a place where he could raise a child, so he brought him to my parents.  There was never a legal adoption, but my parents raised him as their own from there on out, and he was raised as my sibling.  We refer to each other as ""brother"" and ""sister"", most people at school thought we were siblings (we resemble each other), he universally calls my parents mom and dad and considers us his family. The fact that we are actually cousins only comes up when its a matter of talking about biology or his biological family."
neckbeardstories,2uex1l,Intranetusa,2,Sun Feb 1 18:51:40 2015 UTC,"How young did he go through this if you don't mind answering. Seems a little heart breaking if he was at a certain age of self awareness, but then it would allow him to grow up to be a better person. Unless he went through that adolescent rebellious phase because he did grow out of that if he did.   And how is his relationship with his bio dad?  I imagined he's less resentful of him than his mother but if it's all part of that family drama you don't want to mention then that's fine.   I just find his story to be interesting."
neckbeardstories,2uex1l,syntheticsylph,6,Mon Feb 2 14:08:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, he went through some anger, but managed to focus it pretty well and is well adjusted.  His mother and he have a horrible relationship with no contact anymore.  Basically, leaving him behind at his dad's house was sort of manipulative, and she was really angry and manipulative throughout his childhood.  He has both full and half siblings, all of whom have ended up as really fucked up adults thanks to her upbringing.  His dad though literally couldn't take care of him.  He was living in a room in a boarding house at the time, and my uncle has mild autism.  Although my brother was really angry at him for some time, we've come to see it as an act of love.  My uncle tried to be supportive and part of my brother's life as well, and helped out with money, would come over when his work allowed and help us all with homework, and would plan trips that we all went on as a family.  He just literally couldn't be a single father, so he was a well liked uncle."

neckbeardstories,2u9bn3,FinnSven,0,Sun Feb 1 13:37:38 2015 UTC,"I think you have misunderstood but I will try to clarify.  I was never a neckbeard, a little geeky for a time, a little immature, but I got into drugs and violence, not magic the gathering and bronys. That sort of stuff is after my time anyway.  Sure when I was a teenager, it took me a little time to figure out how to talk to women, but also I realised as an adult, that there were girls at school who liked me and I never picked up on it!  I was mostly into video games, pen and paper rpgs, warhammer models, in my early teens but left that sort of stuff behind around 14.   Neckbeards who are 20-, I think are mostly awkward teenagers and a lot of teenage boys are awkward.   I personally class a Neckbeard as a guy who is at least 18, classic basement dweller/living with parents, convinced that women will fall for them as they are a niceguy(tm)/gentleman, usually but not 100% of the time into Stereotype ""Geeky/Nerdy"" pursuits, arrogantly insists they are smarter and superior, or believes it without being aware that they are not. Basically the Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons.  Calling nerdy teenagers who are wet behind the ears, ""Neckbeards"" confuses this whole thing a bit.     I have met teenage ""chavvy"" and Football Hooligan types who show this exact kind of awkwardness and misunderstanding around girls and women.  I doubt many would class them as ""Neckbeards""."

I guess we shouldn't expect anything less from her and her attention seeking history, but my mouth literally dropped open when I read that.  Sitting in a corner talking smack and being general douchecanoes at your parents WEDDING ANNIVERSARY PARTY is one thing.  At least she sat to the side, and was generally ignorable.  But to plot to steal the attention IN THAT WAY, is truly something else.  Also I think you did the right thing by trying to sweep it under the rug as best you could.  At that point you had a choice to make; make a scene and try and add one more thing to the back of the drama camel who was already shaking under the weight of the days events OR figure out how to make it go away as quickly and quietly as possible.  You guys established a watch and were ready for anything should it happen.  That is the best way you could have handled it."

neckbeardstories,2u7bia,TheEmpty_Child,10,Sat Jan 31 01:17:35 2015 UTC,What an absolute bitch. After reading this whole series I can't help but wonder if her parents ever regretted going through with her pregnancy instead of ending it prior to the wedding. I know that's a horrible thing to say and I know we're only getting the bad stories about this girl but I somehow can't imagine she had any redeeming qualities. I feel so bad for her parents. Their anniversary was nearly ruined and her mom had to babysit her during a wedding reception! Who does that? Amanda is an adult by this point and her mother should be able to go out and enjoy the reception.
neckbeardstories,2u7bia,I_trip_over_hurdles,9,Fri Jan 30 16:18:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the longer this story series has gone on the more convinced I've become that Amanda is not exactly mentally firm.  That doesn't excuse her behavior, of course.  But I think her parents simply have no idea how to handle a child who seems to be mentally ill.  And let's face it, there's very little in the way of support programs in this country for dealing with a mentally ill family member."

neckbeardstories,2u7bia,SirLenzalot,3,Sat Jan 31 00:00:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I used ""therapist"" as that was the term both Amanda and her mom used.

neckbeardstories,2u7oy1,ReizbarOokami13,1 point,Sat Jan 31 01:46:57 2015 UTC,"Culottes:       Culottes are an item of clothing, originally the knee-breeches commonly worn by gentlemen of the European upper-classes from the late Middle Ages or Renaissance through the early nineteenth century. This style of tight trousers ending just below the knee was first popularized in France during the reign of Henry III (1574–1589).  Culottes were normally closed and fastened about the leg, to the knee, by either buttons, a strap and buckle, or by a draw-string. During the French Revolution of 1789–1799, working-class revolutionaries were known as the ""sans-culottes"" – literally, ""without culottes"" – a name derived from their rejection of aristocratic apparel.  In the United States, only the first five Presidents, from George Washington through James Monroe, wore culottes according to the style of the late 18th century.

neckbeardstories,2u67kr,Hush009,27,Fri Jan 30 06:35:43 2015 UTC,"After reading neckbeard and fatpeople stories I felt like re-reading an old swedish story about changelings yesterday. A story about a troll who swaps their troll child with a baby princess and the king and queen are forced to raise this horribly ugly troll child who in spite of their best efforts to raise her is rude to everyone, throw fits and acts like an entitled piece of shit because ""she's the princess"".  Like the CaterHam stories in /r/fatpeoplestories/ they sometimes even have siblings that are perfectly normal even if they're raised the same way. So yeah, I'm beginning to think that maybe changelings are real. How else can seemingly good parents end up with kids like that?"

neckbeardstories,2u67kr,Ploxiecat,7,Fri Jan 30 12:50:05 2015 UTC,"Well, just to point it out (for my own and possibly your amusement's sake), people actually thought some of their children were changelings back in medieval Scandinavia if they really stuck out or were plain terrible, like... y'know, the stereotypical neckbeard/hamplanet. The results were really not pretty at all.  But, frankly, I believe ya'. It's really surreal how these people behave. I just consider the stories at least partially fictional, because no one can be that terrible without being a serial killer... right?  Source: Am Scandinavian, remember reading this in a history book once while in elementary."
neckbeardstories,2u67kr,kyshock,7,Fri Jan 30 12:57:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah i'm scandinavian too. One common belief was that if you tortured and abused the baby you could force whatever troll or other creature that took your baby to return it. So they'd put those kids through hell. Whip them, burn them and all kinds of nasty stuff.   But honestly how the hell could you deal with mental illness back in the days when you had to work on a farm all day and had no access to modern medicine? I went to Vadstena this summer, they have a museum in an old monastery where they kept the mentally ill back in the days. They would torture them and lock them up because that was the only way they could manage to exhaust them and keep them calm when they threw a fit. They simply had no clue what they could do to help them. Nothing worked. I'd recommend going there if you're in the area, it helps you understand just how helpless people were to deal with it before psychopharmaca."

I won't be in that part of Sweden anytime soon, though, considering I'm not Swedish and it's a hella long drive (when compared to what I'm used to).  And yes. I remember hearing about that common belief. A way of preventing changelings was to baptize the baby as soon as possible - because then it couldn't be ""taken"".   I hadn't actually thought of the fact that said ""changelings"" were probably mentally ill (derp, my bad). My history classes preferred focusing on the wars and political changes (naturally so, sadly) rather than the more interesting cultural aspects of history. Sadly, you often couldn't do much about the mentally ill back then - people had no idea what worked most of the time. We had a crazy king and no one really knew how to deal with him (and that was only some centuries ago!)... people in the medieval times, especially people on isolated farms (and the likes) had even less of a chance to figure out what the hell to do about these people. It must've been much easier, in a sense, to just blame it on changelings."

Its was amazing. they stay pretty tame for most of the night. when people were leaving one made some kind of comment that didn't sit well with my dad, and he just cold clocked the dude in the side of the head than reminding the group that they had one waring and not it was time to leave.

I mean, I'm not saying the other guy isn't, but you come across like kind of a prick here.  And it's not the hilarious casual racism either, in fairness to you that kind of casual manner of speech is just how the Brits speak. It's the petty subtext of every description and the unbearably ""I'm just a cool guy who does cool guy stuff"" coating...  Plus you dissed Pratchett. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but yours, in this case, is the wrong opinion"
neckbeardstories,2u733j,drowsy1,0,Fri Jan 30 20:43:31 2015 UTC,"I liked pratchett when I was a teenager.  It was a pity when he got Alzheimer's disease.  Pratchett is fine when you are a kid, but as I said to someone else, he had his day. The reason I pointed it out, is it becomes clear later that his Pratchett thing was just another sign of his self absorbed immaturity.   I am perfectly aware that I do come across as a bit of a prick.  That petty subtext is applied to myself as well. I know a number of people view me like that and the thing is, I am more ok with that than most.  One of the themes of a lot of neckbeard stories are that the op is either a girl fending off some stalky type who wears a fedora, has bad hygiene and no idea to conduct themselves socially, or a guy detailing his change from neckbeard life and or how they are a brony who plays magic the gathering, but not a neckbeard, no way!   Of course it is easy to get behind a girl being stalked, and I suspect most of the guys see themselves in the reformed neckbeards.  Me a neckbeard? I don't buy that. Bit of a prick, fine, bit narcissistic, ok, that comes from having to preserve a sense of self worth in a difficult situation. Plus I have always been a bit like that.  But I am a socially responsible, aware, person.  Sure I have a ""roguish"" edge, but I am more akin to an apprentice contestant type than a shut in who patronizes people and fully believes them self to be smarter than the rest of humanity.   I am trying to be honest about this sequence of events and that is also why this first one has been a little boring."

It is placed under the upper lip for extended periods. Snus is not fermented and contains no added sugar. Although used similarly to American dipping tobacco, snus does not typically result in the need for spitting and, unlike naswar, snus is steam-pasteurized.  The sale of snus is illegal in the European Union   and Turkmenistan  but, due to special exemptions, it is still manufactured and consumed primarily in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark (Both loose and portion). The Russian State Duma drafted a bill which banned snus in Russia from 1 June 2013 onwards;  however, it was never ratified. Local varieties of snus, growing in popularity in the United States, are seen as an alternative to smoking, chewing, and dipping tobacco. However, some believe US-manufactured snus is different from Swedish snus and should not be called ""snus"".

neckbeardstories,2u3lmn,Euloque,3,Thu Jan 29 18:09:10 2015 UTC,"no but literally a beard on then neck. you're not supposed to do that, you're supposed to shave below the chin.  And the hats are called fedoras/triblys."
neckbeardstories,2u3lmn,Euloque,-7,Thu Jan 29 18:10:54 2015 UTC,Depends what style you are going for; actually shaving right under the chin can look odd in some circumstances.  Yeah but why put emphasis on fedoras then?
neckbeardstories,2u3lmn,Hard_Bodied_Man,4,Thu Jan 29 18:13:58 2015 UTC,"A lot of neck beards only grow hair on their necks, not on their faces. Patchy beards commonly.   A Neckbeard personality type is a different story, usually someone who is socially awkward but with a high opinion of themselves. Their sense of fashion Based more on characters from fantasy than reality. There is often a sense of entitlement due to creating their ideal picture of reality and becoming upset that the rest of the world doesn't conform to it. Many of them also sport a bearded neck."

neckbeardstories,2u3lmn,Hard_Bodied_Man,2,Thu Jan 29 18:18:29 2015 UTC,"The main point of the ""neckbeard"" description is that it's a particular type of person that tends to be unkempt. Having a scruffy neckbeard is typically due to lack of proper maintenance, but not always. A typical saying is ""It's not the beard on your neck, but the beard in your heart that counts"" or replace beard with ""fedora"".   It's not the presence of a beard, or even that beards are unattractive, but rather that the persona being discussed tends to have such a beard, because they are too busy playing video games, eating junk food, discussing on /r/atheism, or watching anime, to take care of their hygiene. Thus, they:   tend to smell bad (too busy for laundry) lack social skills (watching anime and playing video games don't help) have horrible fashion sense (anime shirt, fingerless gloves, ratty sneakers, but my fedora will make me classy) be overweight (no time to cook, must eat Doritos instead) simultaneously worship women yet demean them with fake chivalry (watching porn all the time, combined with anime and lack of social skills) many, many more   There are many attributes here, and each neckbeard has some critical mass of them that make them into pretty much the same person as all the other neckbeards, regardless of if they are skinny or beardless or hate anime. It's just that the beard is pretty dang common among them."
neckbeardstories,2u3lmn,Hard_Bodied_Man,-7,Thu Jan 29 18:20:33 2015 UTC,"Beard in the heart is not medically possible.   It's not the presence of a beard, or even that beards are unattractive, but rather that the persona being discussed tends to have such a beard, because they are too busy playing video games, eating junk food, discussing on /r/atheism, or watching anime, to take care of their hygiene.   Ah thus it is a sub for shaming people with different interests, and whose behavior doesn't match your definition of ""normal"". Ok it is an intolerance-based sub... This clears things up. I'll return to my sexism and racism-based subs."
neckbeardstories,2u3lmn,drharris,4,Thu Jan 29 18:25:45 2015 UTC,"Ah thus it is a sub for shaming people with different interests, and whose behavior doesn't match your definition of ""normal"".   Maybe. In this case, though, the particular combination of interests creates a persona that believes they are better than the rest of society, demeans women and many other groups of people, typically are of no benefit to society (many living at home or unable to keep down a job), and have friend groups primarily consisting of other neckbeards.  So yeah, it's a bit of poking fun, but I tend to see it more as ""If you have friends exhibiting any of these properties, form an intervention immediately, and keep them from a life of being a detriment to society."""

neckbeardstories,2tufxo,redheadheroine,5,Wed Jan 28 21:32:23 2015 UTC,"She wasn't murdered.  It was just that the idea of her disappearing, moving in with a boyfriend no one knew and only communicating via email to her friends sounded like the set up for a Forensic Files episode."

Short version up until this point in time was that Senior year of high school she started to pull a stalker-crush deal on my brother.  I basically had to tell her to knock it off.  While she technically did, she spent some time making moon eyes at him.  He just chose to ignore it and avoid her.  I became aware that she was obsessing over him when she sent me drawings that had a guy with his (high school) haircut and the same name as him.  She also had started talking to him more.

Now for my side of the story:  I met miss Quillemote a couple months after a break-up; we met in a public place for a friendly drink and chat; things went smoothly we clicked real easy, no PUA tricks were used, I was very pleasantly surprised, we had lots in common. I actually started to think that I had found a woman I could actually be myself around (very much unlike what the PUA/redpill community tends to teach you).  At our second meet it was obvious there was attraction there so I decided to do something I rarely do (I have, recently diagnosed via MMPI2, AvPD and therefore I am chronically shy and avoid complications when possible): I made a move to which she responded very favourably and things went from there. Note, at this point being emotionally fragile from my breakup, I made her promise to not pull the ""vanish trick"" on me and tell me if she was feeling like pulling out well ahead of time.  We secretly went about things because of her boyfriend, whom she regularly complained about, dead bedroom and all.  It was very taxing emotionally to see miss Quillemote as she was rarely available because of said boyfriend and, I came to realize later her own insecurities. At which point I reached a breaking point after not having managed to see her for nearly a month; I decided to pull off a ""bold"" move and show up near her ""work"" place (where we usually met anyhow) and tell her I was there for shopping and she was welcome to join me. I thought this might stop her insecurities. At this point she simply pulled the ""vanish trick"" on me; and is now laying blame on me.  Also, she assumed from my post history that I was a hardcore redpiller at the time, which I wasn't at this point in my life (post breakup) I was jaded with relationships and if anything I was mgtow."

Hell, by YOUR story, it sounds like you painted here into a corner just for a kill, so to speak.   Also, when a girl becomes less available because she spends so much time with her REAL boyfriend, I usually take that as a hint that it was just a fling."

neckbeardstories,2tujoi,DildoMissile,8,Fri Jan 30 17:22:38 2015 UTC,"Well, okay.  From my perspective I thought I'd been pretty clear that I was looking for friends, that I do have a boyfriend however strained our relationship gets sometimes, and that I don't have a lot of time.  I enjoyed talking to you online, and I enjoyed meeting you for a few hours in public even if it never actually became an in-private thing.  I did tell you repeatedly that I wasn't comfortable with the idea of cheating on my boyfriend.  Then you began trying to put pressure on me to spend time with you that I don't have to spare, since the rest of my life is spoken-for already.  I don't like people trying to pressure me, guilt-trip me, or otherwise try to force me to do things because they want them when I've already said no.  It's a lack of respect on your part.  After you showed up in the city and tried to guilt-trip me into seeing you, along with that whole ""i don't drive safe, i take out my anger on the road"" text after I said to have a safe drive home, we did talk it over for quite a while online.  I gave you my reasons and said what was on my mind, and you answered by getting angry/mean and accusing me of ""hamstering"".  You said ""goodbye""; even if you hadn't, I'm in no way obligated to maintain contact with someone trying to emotionally jerk me around.  Frankly, yo, throwing bizarre catchphrase-scorn at someone when you don't like what she says is not okay; taking out your lingering bitterness about women on women isn't going to make said women particularly eager to throw themselves back for more of your unresolved anger issues."
neckbeardstories,2tujoi,Intranetusa,-10,Wed Jan 28 15:52:14 2015 UTC,"If you had been so uncomfortable you could easily have pushed me away; especially in public.

Cheating is cheating even in public.  Nevertheless, you are right I was indeed bitter about women after my break-up and my experience with you only served to build upon that bitterness. I am afraid, you may have proved the red pill or mgtow right in their assumption that there are no unicorns (how foolish was I thinking you could be special) and that women will lay blame on the guy as much as possible to not face their own fails.

After all of this: the complaining, the mooching, the emotional manipulation, the stubbornness, the brattiness, and the straight up THEFT, I'd have left this person to their own devices ages ago."
neckbeardstories,2tf45v,FinnSven,8,Fri Jan 23 18:03:14 2015 UTC,"I have been curiously reading this entire saga, I have an interest in the psychology of why people behave the way they do and with personality and psychological disorders. Its clear Amanda has something really fucked up in her head, just wondering why her clinical diagnosis is. Im going with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. She seems to fit all these criteria:  Symptoms of Narcissistic Personality Disorder  In order for a person to be diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) they must meet five or more of the following  symptoms:  Has a grandiose sense of self-importance (e.g., exaggerates achievements and talents, expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements)  Is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love  Believes that he or she is “special” and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions)  Requires excessive admiration  Has a very strong sense of entitlement, e.g., unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectations  Is exploitative of others, e.g., takes advantage of others to achieve his or her own ends  Lacks empathy, e.g., is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others  Is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or her  Regularly shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes"
neckbeardstories,2tf45v,evilkory,3,Fri Jan 23 21:11:48 2015 UTC,"Sounds about right, except I think to call a person 'fucked up in her head' is an unnecessary value judgement.  I don't get the sense that Amanda's 'maladjustment' comes from a malicious place, but more a naive lack of self-awareness (she definitely seems to pay the price for going against the grain often enough (emotionally rather than financially, it seems)). I think many people experience this to some extent... or maybe I'm just saying that because I notice some Amanda-ish difficulty relating to others in myself sometimes.  It's a shame!    Although OP is a good-ass-person to not treat this individual dismissively at every turn. No Amanda is an island!"

When Amanda had issues, I think I thought I could swoop in and save her.  And by ""fixing"" her daughter, I could repay her mom for everything she had done for me.  I was wrong, of course, but this was before I really understood how toxic people could be, and how you can't fix someone who doesn't want help."

If you just meet someone and they are clearly mentally disabled in a very subtle way that doesn't garner pity (like Amanda) then why would you choose to ruin your experience.

I was a little shit, and I got slapped in the face by life in much the same way she did my first couple years.

Compile some evidence, which is not the right word-maybe the interactions the residents had with her that made them uncomfortable? Ok, that's better. I don't know the protocol at your school, but at mine we had mediations/warnings (Sure she's gotten at least one), then some severe punishment if the behavior continued or escalated.  Does your school have mental health resources for students? I think she could benefit from a counselor or some professional intervention. I'm not defending her, just maybe a plan to have your bases covered.  Above all, and you seem to value this, protect the residents, in the sense that you want them to feel comfortable in their environment. Again, you seem to be really passionate about inclusion, so safety goes hand in hand.

neckbeardstories,2t29h6,kermi42,10,Tue Jan 20 18:04:56 2015 UTC,/r/theredpill. Fair warning - if you see women as actual human beings rather than penis attachments/sandwich artists you're not gonna like what you find.
neckbeardstories,2t29h6,mistershedz,11,Tue Jan 20 18:21:37 2015 UTC,Oh wow...okay yeah. I worked with a guy like this. Constantly attempted to neg one of my female coworkers and myself but then got his feelings all hurt when I said I found it odd that a woman deemed him worthy of procreation. (He has four kids) I apologized but after that he left me alone for the most part.  Asked my best friend for my phone number AND attempted to connect with me on LinkedIn. Ew. No Thanks. The funny thing is how awkward these guys tend to be IRL. Online everyone is Sir Galahad but get them in a room and it's like a bad prom night all over again.

Before the formal debacle, I partially went to the teacher because it seemed that she might have been sexual to Fred while he was totally manipulating her.  I honestly still don't know, but he went on in life to be kind of a dick, so I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't see potential to use a boy-crazy girl and walk away without repercussion.  And she really really didn't deserve that.  We were prepared to all rally around her, but instead she handled things in the worst way possible.

The Reason we look back and think our childhood summers were longer. Are because at the time they took or a large portion of our total lifespan. And the way long term memory work, how long something feels like is relative to many factors."
neckbeardstories,2sug0q,BrokenRanger,7,Sun Jan 18 18:41:01 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Two months is a lifetime in high school.
neckbeardstories,2sug0q,TooFewShoes,2,Mon Jan 19 01:01:56 2015 UTC,"Somewhat relatable: To this day, SO and YT are still very much together, and people in my school think because we've been together for about a year and half, and I'm still in high school, they think we're like soulmates or something when in reality, a year and half isn't that remarkable for what I like to call ""a-real-world-relationship."""
neckbeardstories,2sug0q,BrokenRanger,1 point,Mon Jan 19 02:03:03 2015 UTC,"I met my wife when we were 16, At the Renfair is high school, Everyone was saying it was just a hormonal fling and that it wouldnt last past the summer. 14 years later were still together. But  1 1/2 is a long time is high school. Thats half also have the time you were there. And a good portions of the time you have been figuring out who you are. Like whit memory comment. from 12-18 is a huge point in out lives where we figured out who were are. Because you can decided who you like and dont like. And I am going to stop my self before I go on a rant. As I just might know A thing or two."
neckbeardstories,2sug0q,nascraytia,2,Mon Jan 19 15:29:32 2015 UTC,I think I can agree. The story took place about a year and half ago and it just feels so long ago.

neckbeardstories,2sug0q,OneMoreGinger,9,Sun Jan 18 21:34:51 2015 UTC,You've got nothing yo worry about morally speaking in my opinion.   If he couldn't even bring himself to ask you out face to face and never told his mate about it the theres no obligation for either of you to reject your happiness because of him :)
neckbeardstories,2sug0q,GrollTheLicker,1 point,Sun Jan 18 19:25:19 2015 UTC,That's the part where I felt sorry for him to be honest - I think that neckie lost his nerve when he stopped and just stared at OP before saying be would text her. I know what it's like to get that tongue-tied or nervous about something.  No redeeming features in the rest of the story though.
neckbeardstories,2sug0q,_what_the_truck,1 point,Mon Jan 19 01:03:27 2015 UTC,"I mean, I could tell he had something personal to say. He let the group walk ahead of him so we could have that private moment, and I still feel incredibly bad because I can see how he, probably to this day, thinks I created this ""No relationship rouse"" and then started dating a friend of his maybe out of spite.  And call me a bitch, but a text? He could have at least called. A text just feels so impersonal, and I don't see how you can start such a personal thing like that."

neckbeardstories,2sug0q,mladybot,4,Fri Jan 23 22:04:50 2015 UTC,Your original response to sir neckbeard was totally fine-if he had any kind of clue he'd take that as you trying to gently reject him. Sounds like you both were better off when he gave you the silent treatment anyway!

That pause in the driveway, the body language, I could tell he was nervous, so he wanted to ask me out physically.   It just always bothered me because he never dealt with it, and took it out on SO. They used to play like Halo and CoD all the time, and after that, just nothing. I mean the dude had nothing to do with me stabbing the guy in the back, but whatevs.   Oh, and no doubt NC had some issues. I heard he asked a few girls out in a certain timespan and they all rejected him, so I'm guessing rejection after rejection can take a toll.  But another thing, he seemed to want a relationship, just for the status aspect of it. I mean, when he asked me, he hardly knew me. He'd only talk to me on walks, and they weren't exactly fruitful conversations. With SO, we talked hours every day before I realized I had this major crush on him."

Of course I go into the comment section and tell him he's a literal rapist and that his wife should press charges and find someone new.  Well I argued with a LOT of Red Pillers in that thread after I made that comment, and they began making SRS-like posts within that sub and it's brother-subs that led to my comment and discussing how I was a Feminist Beta-Male Faggot that doesn't believes in Spousal Rape.

Your story actually kinda reminded me of a neckbeard I was friends with at one point (probably the whole creative writing angle plus the fact that I haven't slept).

This person by their own admission was working part time in a toy shop.  Correct me if I am wrong, but the ability to diagnose someone as an aspie by sight is not a required qualification to work in a toy shop.   This person undoubtedly has problems, but they are not automatically an aspie. They might just really be a twisted pervert with no regard for others."
neckbeardstories,2ss1iv,flucksy,1 point,Sun Jan 18 14:11:31 2015 UTC,"I was going off of the behavior the person described in the story. The verbose language, not asking for permission to take the toy, the rambling that nobody understood or cared about and not letting himself be interrupted by the mother are all pretty obvious sign of aspergers.   So, yeah, I'm not just taking op's word alone that he might actually have aspergers. It has symptoms, you know."
neckbeardstories,2ss1iv,FinnSven,1 point,Sun Jan 18 17:47:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Most of my wife's family have it! Including my stepson who I deal with daily.   I am saying that this guy could be an aspie, but there are people who are not aspies and really just fail to give a fuck about anyone else. Aspies, other than just my family, I have known are often horrified when they find out that their behavior has upset or hurt others. Even though many aspies lack an ""active"" empathy, they do understand when explained to why their behavior hurts others.   So, of course while Aspergers varies from person to person, this person described could have issues other than Aspergers.

I know she's telling the story so is consensual, but from an outside perspective it could be date rape. Lots of guys get nailed/jail for having ""consensual"" sex with a girl in her condition."

neckbeardstories,2spg25,CaptIncorrect,-5,Sat Jan 17 15:52:33 2015 UTC,"Not really. I've seen plenty of people in that situation in collage get in a lot of trouble. You didn't choose to say he raped you, but if you had the next day, even though you were willing at the time, you could get him arrested. Also, because of your age, depending on where you live he could be thrown on the sex offender list for the rest of his life.  I knew a girl that pulled this on a friend of mine (actually was a step brother at one point but that's a long story) because he broke up with her. She was pissed and told the cops she was raped. She very obviously wasn't, but because alcohol was involved she could easily claim she was and won. Screwed up his life good."

Lots of youtube videos, my favorite is three girls in a cab called the cops saying they were raped by a cab driver to get out of paying a 20 dollar cab ride.

neckbeardstories,2spg25,Torpedo_Borec,7,Sat Jan 17 15:54:25 2015 UTC,Nope. If she's under the influence she can't legally consent. Especially at that age where it's probably statutory rape anyways.

The closest thing was you allowing him to sit in your hotel room for a bit, but the fact that the next day, you told the teacher you suspected he had stolen your knickers. That is only possibly friendly if it was a practical joke which they would understand as a practical joke .  For instance, a friend and I placed her vibrator in a mutual friends coat pocket before we all left for a nightclub. Knowing that this nightclub insists everyone checks their coat in the cloakroom and this friend always empties his pockets on the desk to check he has his cigarettes, wallet, phone, etc.  Of course he eventually saw the funny side, and knew it was me behind this.   Secondly, ""Night, please! You're perfect for me, and I'm perfect for you!"" and ""I love you, Night. You are the most beautiful girl I've ever met in my life, and I want to spend the rest of it with you."" What the hell? It sounds very much like all he really knew of you is that you like some things he likes.   You don't describe actually hanging out with him and talking properly. Just trying to avoid him and answering questions when you could not.   Did you find out if he has done things like this to other girls?  A frustrated reaction involving smacking a tree with a branch, screaming things like ""why do they always say no?"" indicates that he probably has.   Hopefully he will be placed on the sex offenders register, then end up in prison for moving home and failing to tell the authorities."
neckbeardstories,2sokz1,ReizbarOokami13,1 point,Sat Jan 17 10:47:54 2015 UTC,"I have no idea where he got the idea of us being friends from.  And I'm pretty sure he has done this to others as well, but to be honest I don't want to find out."
neckbeardstories,2sokz1,ReizbarOokami13,2,Sat Jan 17 11:08:06 2015 UTC,"Well it sounds like he does not even quite understand what being friendzoned means.   I hope he gets some help, be it professional psychological or a friend who helps him grow up and see the error of his ways."

Not (barely) tolerate you, not just say hi to you passing by, and not want you gone because you are a fucking creep... but and ACTUAL friend.  And I'm saying this as someone with his fair share of romantic rejections (Luckily, more in the ""you are a great guy, just not into you"" kind of thing)... have some dignity about it.

It takes balls to molest a girl making out with a bigger, stronger boyfriend. That's psycho territory, to pull that off.   The only time I've seen neckbeards pull off a furtive grope is at concerts, when they feel up girls crowdsurfing, or will get into the crush near the stage and try to feel up a girl from behind. Me and my friends used to chase asswipes like that out of the crowd all the time. (Yes, you get metal head neckbeards)  But this? He's either crazier than she's making him out to be, or it's made up. Entertaining, sure. I just don't buy it. Neckbeards by definition are pussies - and too ""pure"" and ""chivalrous"" to grope a girl like that.

Should I constantly remind her about how much of a nice, nice guy I am, and also reinforce that literally everyone else will hurt her?

First move, after loosening a few of his molars with the flat of your hand, should be to block the number called. Fuck that."

Seriously though I had a friend in SLC say this: We don't roll up our sleeves because someone is afraid of the sun, and the only time we are in short sleeves is in PTs so the only people who are offended are other soldiers who are pussys.

There's a lot of dicks around and if you don't fight for yourself then you get screwed over.

neckbeardstories,2scbj7,rhuur,3,Wed Jan 14 03:36:05 2015 UTC,"Because everyone is alpha as fuck during high school and not at all just trying to avoid uncomfortable social situations that draw attention to themselves.

neckbeardstories,2scbj7,rhuur,-12,Wed Jan 14 04:34:03 2015 UTC,"Listen, the way I see it you're the one doing damage here.  You are assuming OP is not able to tell me to fuck of herself.  You are creating another situation where someone bails her out - and I'm not even doing that much, I'm saying she could stand up for herself.  People like you create more people unable to deal with stuff cause there's always someone else ready to jump in front of them and do it for them.  I will use an analogy if you don't mind: I'm like a vaccine here, a 'tiny' example of someone who needs to be told to fuck off. OP can do that and slowly learn to do it with real cunts.  You on the other hand are the vaccine denying parent that makes her child completely unprepared for measles.  Think what kind of damage you cause by wrapping people in cotton wool.  Tough love is better than sugarcoating and harsh reality once people are left on their own."

As a pretty MILF, you'd think she show her daughter, from a youngun on up, how to dress to suit her features and, in time, how to do her make-up.  I don't know if her mom fits this category, but some pretty moms don't have the time of day for their daughters, and actually take pride in being prettier than them.

neckbeardstories,2s6qnx,mladybot,7,Tue Feb 10 09:28:00 2015 UTC,"I believe that Amanda saw too many movies, where the popular girls look down on anybody else, and act like bitches all the time. So she genuinely believes, that the really popular girls are like that,so if she even wants to be part of that clique, she needs the right attitude.  Now because of that attitude, she never had real girlfriends, that would help her make something out of herself, like wearing the right clothes, and learn how to use make up to her advantage (if you know how, you can do amazing things with make up).   In the end she doomed herself by believing what movies tell her ;)  If she would not be such an entitled bitch, I would feel sorry for her.   QUOTE:""Senior year, we attempted to take her to a makeup counter, and had them do a whole new face on her. When done, it was astounding. She was really pretty. She hated it.""  From how you describe her, I believe she hated being reminded of everything she did wrong for all these years, and seeing how much better she could have looked for all these years. If she would have accepted the new her, it would mean admitting how much she fucked up all these years. She could never do that, especially not with everyone seeing it !!! Claiming she would hate it, and wants to look the way she looks, is her only way out of this HUGE humiliation/disgrace. Bad enough you where with her and witnessed this ordeal ! That is how people like her really think, sad and pathetic, is it not ?"

She had a wide mouth, and her lips were essentially the same width all the way across. No cupids bow, more like fish lips. And, inexplicably, the lip gloss she wore was grape. It turned her lips a wet grayish color, piling into her mouth corners with caked on bluish tinge.   You already had me giggling at the thought of 'half-hiding behind poles to stalk her crushest', but this is what made me have to say something. Goddamn, every word in that paragraph came to me clearer than day  Fantastic series so far. I'm really impressed!"

He'll live his life alone, angry at the world for being unfair, completely oblivious to his own problems."

One reason I hate everything about this type (both males and females) is because they drag you down to their level. It's impossible to remain rational and courteous and kind-hearted around people like this. Eventually you catch yourself fantasizing about getting revenge. It just seems so unfair that they will go on doing what they do with no repercussions and never doubt themselves, it's unfair to you, to their next victim, to the mankind. They bring out the worst in you, all those years you might have spent learning to love and respect and forgive get erased in a heartbeat. You're back to square one. It's funny how even serial killers or terrorists suddenly seem redeemable compared to that cancer. It's what they are in an essence, cancer - you can't ignore it, can't walk away from it, the longer you let it stay the more it consumes you from within. Ugh."

I think a lot of us have come across someone like this, although not usually quite as needy, oblivious, and manipulative, but I suppose that would be a neckbeard quality.  I know that in my own history, I've come across guys that, no matter how many hints you try to drop, they just don't get it.  And I'm usually too nice to be ""hurtful,"" when really I'd just be standing up for myself, to tell them how I honestly feel about the situation.  I understand where you're coming from.  I'm sorry you had to put up with this guy for so long, but thanks for sharing your story with us.  Btw, that assault, as I know a lot of other people have already said, is not okay! I think the fact that he completely glossed over his behavior, and why it was more your problem than something he did wrong, makes me angrier than the action itself.

The constant lying, the pouting when she didn't get her way, it was just all bizarre.  Her mom had been the popular cheerleader girl in high school (and was sort of a MILF by the time I knew her), and she had a younger sister who was really sweet and gorgeous.  I know that Amanda had issues with not being as pretty as them.  But it went way beyond that.  I think she just thought that she should always have her way, or that she could cheat herself into an easy life.  But the pouting, whining, lying and self centeredness just made her, for lack of a better way of putting it, ugly."

neckbeardstories,2s2id2,nam-on,3,Sun Jan 11 20:38:10 2015 UTC,"I'm 18 so I don't think I qualify as an adult yet, but yes I eat a hella lot of vegetables. Carrots particularly, my mom had to give me an earful when I was about 15 because I would always eat all the carrots in the house."
neckbeardstories,2s2id2,AgentKittyfeets,2,Sun Jan 11 21:37:25 2015 UTC,"I was the kind of kid who loved veggies, too. Only one I hated was brussel sprouts, but mom never cooked them right. We're going to try to roast them with a recipe I found."
neckbeardstories,2s2id2,nam-on,2,Sun Jan 11 20:29:32 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid the only way I've found to make brussel sprouts edible is to chop them in half, boil for three minutes then add to a pan with a rasher of chopped bacon frying in it and cook for five more minutes. The bitterness is too overpowering otherwise for my tastes and the saltiness of the bacon works very well with it."
neckbeardstories,2s2id2,heyheyhey27,3,Mon Jan 12 06:36:32 2015 UTC,"That's the best way I've found!  (It's odd because I like cabbage, and brussel sprouts are essentially tiny cabbages...but nope. They're just UGH.)"

neckbeardstories,2s2id2,Stella2010,0,Tue Jan 13 05:07:20 2015 UTC,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato  Tomato is a vegetable for culinary purposes  Out of curiosity; what do you eat?
neckbeardstories,2s2id2,Entegy,1 point,Tue Jan 13 05:14:02 2015 UTC,"Tomato:       The tomato is the edible, often red fruit/berry of the nightshade Solanum lycopersicum,   commonly known as a tomato plant. The species originated in the South American Andes  and its use as a food originated in Mexico, and spread throughout the world following the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Its many varieties are now widely grown, sometimes in greenhouses in cooler climates.  The tomato is consumed in diverse ways, including raw, as an ingredient in many dishes, sauces, salads, and drinks. While it is botanically a fruit, it is considered a vegetable for culinary purposes (as well as under U.S. customs regulations, see Nix v. Hedden), which has caused some confusion. The fruit is rich in lycopene, which may have beneficial health effects.  The tomato belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae.   The plants typically grow to 1–3 meters (3–10 ft) in height and have a weak stem that often sprawls over the ground and vines over other plants. It is a perennial in its native habitat, although often grown outdoors in temperate climates as an annual. An average common tomato weighs approximately 100 grams (4 oz).

neckbeardstories,2s1wkz,FinnSven,5,Sun Jan 11 12:19:58 2015 UTC,"He wasn't drunk all the time, but he did drink quite a bit. He would get off work at 8 or 9 in the morning and go home and have a drink or four. I always compared it to a normal person unwinding after a long day. Those are the times he would send me messages about how much he loved me and missed me, how he couldn't live without me and I gave up on him and blah blah blah. Maybe he was an alcoholic....."
neckbeardstories,2s1wkz,FinnSven,4,Sun Jan 11 14:55:49 2015 UTC,Maybe.  How strict are hospitals at screening employees with substance problems?   You said he is a paramedic right?
neckbeardstories,2s1wkz,hicctl,2,Sun Jan 11 15:30:14 2015 UTC,"He's an ""EMT"". That's what he claimed.   I don't know how strict his employer was. But he had been working there for a long time.   When I told him I wanted to move out of state, he actually told me that I needed to consider his job security because if he had to move he would have to take a pay cut.   He told me, in his pleading moments, that he would give up the drinking if it meant he didn't lose me. I said, ""Even when you get home in the morning?"" And he told me those drinks didn't count because they were just so he could unwind. Ummmm but they're alcohol, no?"

neckbeardstories,2s1wkz,bunnycupcakes,2,Thu Jan 15 15:20:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly. No means no. And for some reason, he had decided that me telling him no meant nothing. What made it worse to me, as if it could get worse, was that he never even acknowledged that it happened. He used the logic that he was drunk, he didn't remember, and therefore I should forgive him. I'm sorry, but rape and abuse aren't forgivable acts in my book."
neckbeardstories,2s1wkz,Hush009,2,Thu Jan 15 15:23:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, attempted rape is THE unforgivable sin. I can forgive infidelity, but going against consent is an absolute deal breaker !!!  That he did not even acknowledge what he did wrong, shows how fucked up he really is.

neckbeardstories,2rxzn2,1337k1d,1 point,Wed Apr 15 11:53:03 2015 UTC,"I do have his address. I don't plan on causing him physical harm. His last communication with me is that he's ""miserable"" without me. I'm content to go ahead and let him wallow in freakish misery.   Because I am happier than I have been in 15 years. I have a great life now, and to me, that's enough payback."

I still find neckbeards and their lack of self awareness baffling. Then again a lot of guys who are not neckbeards still think they are gods gift to women, even when they are beer bellied, balding, pudgy and wear a football (soccer/rugby league) top all the time."
neckbeardstories,2rxzn2,lickvandyke,1 point,Sat Jan 10 13:19:26 2015 UTC,That is true....  Sad isn't it?
neckbeardstories,2rxzn2,lickvandyke,7,Sat Jan 10 14:47:33 2015 UTC,Did you consider that at least informing the cops might put him on their radar on case he tries this shit again with another girl? Just a thought.
neckbeardstories,2rxzn2,lickvandyke,5,Sat Jan 10 14:50:27 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I didn't think of it that way. I was too upset to relive it in any form and just wanted to get home, to safety."
neckbeardstories,2rxzn2,lickvandyke,4,Sat Jan 10 15:08:34 2015 UTC,Want me to beat his ass? How does castration sound. Seriously fuck this guy and I hope you kicked him in his less than ideal equipment.
neckbeardstories,2rxzn2,lickvandyke,6,Sat Jan 10 07:34:19 2015 UTC,"You have my permission to kick his ass, chop off his micro dick, and feed it to him in a purée.   Really.  Go fuck him up."
neckbeardstories,2rxzn2,Alaric_I,2,Sat Jan 10 07:37:58 2015 UTC,The funny thing is. I have a feeling we are in the same general area. My in-laws are two hours from Vegas and generally go over the Hoover dam to get there.
neckbeardstories,2rxzn2,Alaric_I,3,Sat Jan 10 07:47:18 2015 UTC,"It's completely possible. Without giving up too much, I'm close to Disneyland and Angel Stadium. BlueBeard lived an hour away from me, towards Riverside."

neckbeardstories,2rxzn2,Runilith,3,Sat Jan 10 08:05:30 2015 UTC,Sounds like my favorite part of chemistry. If you are ever in Flag we have 6 or 7 breweries local here that do a bang up job. Some local distilleries also. Plus liquor and beer delivery. I love delivery.

neckbeardstories,2rxzn2,CubedCubie,5,Sat Jan 10 08:44:20 2015 UTC,"I did not see him again after this. You're not the first that wants to cause him physical harm after reading this story. And likely not the last. You are all welcome to form a pitchfork mob and go fuck him up. I won't stop you!   What I didn't include, that I'm going to go into when I write the epilogue, is that during all of this crazy shit, I found someone a million times better. And I am still in an exclusive, mutually caring, respectful, monogamous relationship with him.   Even whores can reform ;)"

Lives with an ex boyfriend that she claims was abusive, rent free, and sits on facebook almost constantly. Sells shitty anime art on deviantart."

neckbeardstories,2rxdsv,shewantsthedboon,1 point,Sun Jan 11 04:56:34 2015 UTC,"So wait, was that what you were in at this time, or did she switch?"
neckbeardstories,2rxdsv,mladybot,2,Tue Jan 13 21:38:24 2015 UTC,"No, general design studies is the major that my department had to make up in order to push all the super seniors out. It's what you have to do if you don't pass the department review (soph year they pretty much look at your portfolio and engineering grades and keep only the top 1/3 that apply) so I passed and got to stay in mechanical engineering and design and she had to switch majors into general design. From what I heard, two weeks into review season, she said f this and quit. It's a process that lasts up to 6 months and is super hard, so a lot of the advance class people that had been helping her got understandably pissed and severed ties with her."
neckbeardstories,2rxdsv,AggressiveBurrito,1 point,Wed Jan 14 05:31:07 2015 UTC,"Really? Her already being an all-around horrible human being didn't make them sever the ties?  Really tho, congrats on getting through that, engineering and design seem like a difficult combination."
neckbeardstories,2rxdsv,AggressiveBurrito,1 point,Wed Jan 14 06:15:35 2015 UTC,"It's sort of hard to explain. She's so aggressive and assertive that she inserts herself into friendship cliques. People don't want to go ""oh you can't be our friend."" so they just let her stay. Besides, she's really good at stroking your ego when she wants to be, and designers as a whole, have huge egos.   Also thanks! It just was what it was. I like drawing and I like making stuff work, so it worked out for me."

neckbeardstories,2rxdsv,18custodioj,1 point,Sat Jan 10 03:44:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't think she got involved with them. She figured there were two weeks left until she was out of school and three weeks until she'd be boarding the plane to japan, and that at one point, for however brief, BB had been a decent friend. I assume Sakura had warned her that any attempt at contact would result in her calling police, because we didn't see BB until she tried to crash the party, but BB didn't make it anywhere near Sakura. She only tries to contact Sakura once every few months now on facebook, and Sakura blocks her without ever reading the messages. BB will probably never be able to see or talk to her ever again."
neckbeardstories,2rxdsv,Injected_Americas,1 point,Sat Jan 10 05:04:25 2015 UTC,"...and when you contacted the police?  I can't imagine you let all of this happen without consulting the police.  Not just Sakura, but all of this."
neckbeardstories,2rxdsv,rabbidcolossus,2,Sat Jan 10 05:25:22 2015 UTC,I can't imagine the school letting her stay enrolled in this program. It's shameful they didn't kick her out.
neckbeardstories,2rxdsv,rabbidcolossus,1 point,Sun Jan 11 08:01:40 2015 UTC,"the only time we came close to calling the police was when she tried to crash the going away party, Thor had the number on his phone and showed it to her that he was serious and would call the police if she didn't leave and she did. She screamed at him the entire way to her car, but she left. The time that she screamed at Sakura in the hallway, Sakura told us that she didn't want us to involve the school and campus police, so we didn't, but we definitely gave her an escort to wherever she went after that. To be honest, BB is pretty non-threatening looking, just sort of pathetic, I mean she's like 4'7"", weighs like 400 lbs, and is literally as wide as she is tall. She can't even run 5 feet. she calls the shelf her butt makes ""her back"" and is pushed over ridiculously easy, she's actually pushed someone so hard she pushed herself over. So the cops were never involved. Yes, we're shitty friends for not doing so, but if Sakura didn't want it, we weren't going to go out of our way to do it."

From what you have said, either rob just had no sense of what was appropriate or perhaps his friends were egging him on to panty raid you. Of course, he could always have wanted them to use as wank socks.    A crywanker I know. In his thirties, late thirties at that, has been known to do anything for m'ladies in exchange for articles of underwear and socks. I suspect him of dressing up a blow up doll in said articles and sticking hair he finds to its head.   Creepy guys are capable of a lot of weird shit."
