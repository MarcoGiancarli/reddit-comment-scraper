Surely everyone who torrents at least own a desktop computer/laptop and pay for an ISP service (or even an SB service), so I don't think economy is a significant factor here (note that most torrenters reside in the US, still the world's largest economy today). OTOH, I believe that most torrenters would still pirate the hell out of everything even if all of those contents are finally available in all of legitimate platforms/channels. So again, I don't think scarcity/availability is also a major consideration here.   IMO people torrent just because they can."

The store itself also paying money to the police so they can still do their business, thats what I hear. When Indonesian buy a personal computer, they don't know that the OS itself isn't free.

Although some of these people already have access to movies and tv shows through cable network, some times they just don't have time to keep up with it, so they just torrent it to watch whenever they want. Plus it means they don't have to buy some silly pirated dvds or some sorts because the cable network usually comes in a package with fast isp.  I don't know if it affects the torrent or not. But most Indonesians I know are taught in torrent strategy of stop seeding after download is finished to preserve the little bits of bandwith or data usage for another download/playing game/saving internet quotas"
indonesia,3e37on,jejakamandul,2,Tue Jul 21 19:45:34 2015 UTC,"It's popular because of the price factor, convenience and the lack of knowledge of what is pirating.   If you're living in Indonesia then you'll know how easy it is to pick up a game you like for sub-50k or a movie for around the same price. The sellers rarely get disputed by law, making it very common compared to shops that sell the originals. They also win against online shops because of the ease of just walking into one store with cash and purchasing it instead of using a credit card or any form of banking transactions — school kids are the prime examples of this.   Because of that, there are some cases where people never knew they were pirating all along. They just simply thought those CDs contain media they'd like to consume and being sold legally. Until somebody tells them or they find out there's a shop selling in a different price and start questioning why, they'll keep doing that. Heck, if they know then you and I know they'll prefer pirating because the price difference are usually 5-15x higher than pirated copies.  All those, coupled with the lack of understanding of creative content and how piracy works and how it affects the creators, and for computer users, the dangers of pirated copies.   Of course the recent changes suggest that there should be change (a statement with no proof, bear in mind). Steam allows payments from cash cards found in common shops. Play Store allows payments from the cellphone carriers. Online multiplayer games need original copies. Those should be some of the reasons former pirates will give you."

Always be aware of your surroundings and suspicious people contrary to what some people here say, buses and angkots take you to more places than TJ. Try sitting next/close to the driver, ask him the route and tell him where you want to get off, especially if you dont know the exact place. find alternative routes to places you frequent. report your arrival to the local pak RT. a lot of people skip this, but this would help you in the long run. Be friends with the local tough guys. cooking saves money only if you have a fridge and a reasonable way to heat them. Invest on those.  wet markets are cheapest. Low class hypermarts like Giant is 2nd cheapest. Tukang sayur is actually more expensive but you can buy smaller. buy 2nd hand textbooks. Or beg from your seniors.

Use Go-Jek or Uber for fast general transportation (available in Android and iOs) because some cab drivers would drive you around the town and the price is gonna rip you off. Other general transportation works well, I like using TransJakarta because it's easy and safe.  A normal meal costs 15k. You can get cheaper meal on warteg, but if you wanna save some money for food, just buy some groceries at local market (not supermarket). With 30k, you can make three-days meals (2 - 3 meals a day).  Having relatives or friends in Jakarta will help you, a lot."

indonesia,3e3ayb,ncoca,7,Tue Jul 21 17:52:59 2015 UTC,"This. Along with piracy, low purchasing power, Kafkaesque bureaucracy, and Ministry of Moral & Censorship."
indonesia,3e3ayb,Triplekia,2,Tue Jul 21 18:20:35 2015 UTC,"Some people here mention about piracy as one of the contributing factor. I disagree though.   I base my argument on my experience. Before going to study abroad, I used to download illegal mp3 files and movies. But here, experiencing true broadband experience, I never download mp3 anymore. I simply create youtube playlist. Downloading the album is just a waste of time and storage. Moreover, I started to think about giving back to the artists by putting their official Vevo videos to my playlist whenever it is possible. Unfortunately, I cant stop torrenting movies. I do wish to subscribe to netflix. Who doesnt want to just simply have a sit, browsing the catalogues, and play any videos you like in HD? No need to hassle about finding the appropriate torrent with highest seeders, searchig the subtitles, and running out of storage space. It is just that I am a piss poor student who depend his life on scholarship that prevent me to subscribe to them.  There was a good argument on a reddit discussion that services such as netflix is the one who can effectively minimize the spread of piracy. The flexibility to watch one's favorite videos with excellent quality at any time from a huge catalogues at a reasonably cheap price is the main key, I think.   Remember that the reason of people go pirating is not just solely because they do not want to spend money at all. Sometimes it is just that they cannot access the contents from their region at the same time with the origin country. Or maybe it is because they think it is not worth it to buy a DVD that you'll likely never watch again. Netflix and co. offer convenience to access the content much faster than conventional broadcasting business, and it could help to lower piracy.  Back to Indonesia. The biggest problem is, as you know it already, the infrastructure. With current pace from our telco operators, there is a long way to go to be able to enjoy true broadband speed throughout Indonesia. Companies like netflix need to have large number of subscribers in order to get reasonable profits. Currently, their potential customers are only from some areas of small number of Indonesia' s cities. I think it is just not feasible from them to open their business here yet.  Once we have good internet infrastructure at the majority of our households, they will surely come. Indonesia is a big potential market. It is especially true if their marketing team are able to market their services as a new lifestyle. Our people are easily attracted by hypes, arent they? :D"
indonesia,3e3ayb,plesir,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:36:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insights. I think the infrastructure issue, as far as netflix is concerned, doesn't just affect countries like Indonesia. I still hear complaints even from people in the US that the speed is not quite there yet to allow streaming of full HD movies let alone 4Ks. So yeah, the music industry is a few steps ahead in that respect, and it's just rather unfortunate (or a blessing in disguise for some interest groups in the industry) for the film industry.  Btw, what are your go-to trackers for movies?"

indonesia,3e1idz,HaEr48,9,Tue Jul 21 06:08:42 2015 UTC,"Indonesian is in the Austronesian language group which consists of many agglutinative languages. In short, agglutinative languages tend to have a high rate of affixes/morphemes per word, and to be very regular. Agglutinative language is an end of a continuum--the other being fusional language--with various languages falling more toward one or the other end. Comparing Turkish (agglutinative) such as in this picture and Spanish (fusional) in this picture may give a glimpse of the concept.  Indonesian lack of consonant clusters relates to other Austronesian languages, specifically Malayic languages. Just easily compare other Indonesian words with other Malayic like Minangkabau and Banjar. Meanwhile, English love for consonant clusters relates to other Germanic languages. Easily compare it with German or Danish, or Plattdüütsch if it's not enough.  Comparing Indonesian and English is like comparing apples and oranges, imho. One is Austronesian and the other is Indo-European and it's basically finished there."

You can say, well Jokowi is a Javanese and Javanese is part of the Austronesian race, and genetically Austronesians have darker skin. It's like comparing apples and oranges and the explanation is basically finished here. This is the genetic explanation and very similar to your explanation.  You can also say, well it's because his skin has more melanin (or whatever it's called), explain how such skin absorb more light, thus appearing darker.

indonesia,3e1idz,diagramatics,5,Tue Jul 21 07:41:35 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure that's not exactly ""English"" per se — as in a word that contains a meaning in conversations except to name something. One comes from Biology, and another from Chemistry? And pretty sure the second one is the longer, IUPAC-standardized names of a complex compound (no fact-checking, Wikipedia-accessing sentence, CMIIW).  Also that because they're names related to science and based in Latin (?), they can also be the longest word in any other language. The first word makes some sense for Indonesian people working in science-related things and should be the same in Indonesian. Is it... an ultra-microscopic, silicon-based, volcano-related, cone-shaped bacteria/virus that causes pneumonia?  Of course, one could argue the opinions I made aren't true (especially without me checking anything over the Internet).  EDIT: Second word is waaaay suspicious. If it's IUPAC, no two or more words should be written over and over and over again, but more like written in a 3-[word] schematics or more numbers. Lots of repeated compounds in the word, and I can't even find what it means on Google. I'm tempted to bring this word to /r/askscience now.  Source: fading high-school chemistry knowledge and Google-fu.  EDIT 2: Fact checked. The first word is basically silicosis and on Wikipedia says ""an artificial long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust"". Volcano relates to the ash and dust, silico- means the crystalline silica dust, ultramicroscopic because the dusts are very fine, and pneumo- means it can be misdiagnosed as pneumonia. -sis means a form of sickness. Longest word recognized in a dictionary: Oxford English Dictionary. Still unfair IMO since it's artificial and not exactly English.  EDIT 3: Followup from r/askscience, this Wikipedia article sums it up. The protein ""titin"" has a longer technical name, and no, not ""titit"".

Oh right, whenever you're entering an area that looks sacred, have a lot of offerings or that squared white and black cloth tied on things, or places where nature still takes a lot of its space, for maximum safety do not try to pluck anything from the trees / grass or bring anything back with you as a souvenir. Do not say any swear words or insult even if only in your mind. It's always a good practice to excuse yourself whenever you're entering a sacred area or taking pictures of a sacred area.   Every inch of Bali is a sacred land. There has been many unaware tourists who tried to bring something back from a sacred place and couldn't come back until they return the object they have taken."

indonesia,3dxh2w,Glenn20,6,Mon Jul 20 10:01:11 2015 UTC,"... misleading title?  It seems like the article points out Indonesia is cutting the export numbers instead of the other way around.   Mr Joyce's  approval of the health protocols on Monday comes just a week after Indonesia - another major market for Australian live cattle exports - announced it was dramatically reducing the number of cattle it will take.   So this is good news for us then! We're cutting our dependency from imports, especially from beef. It seems the whole campaign PDIP (?) made about how they want to reduce imports on items that the country can produce by ourselves are actually coming to fruition.  I'm updating the flair to elaborate on this. Thanks for notifying the other side about this, OP."
indonesia,3dxh2w,diagramatics,2,Mon Jul 20 13:01:41 2015 UTC,It's nonsense economic policy. Import substitution has never worked in the history of the world and it has been tried many times. The reason politicians do it is because they themselves have a stake in those markets or get money from interest groups.
indonesia,3dxh2w,persija,4,Tue Jul 21 06:22:35 2015 UTC,"No worries, the title was not intended to be misleading but instead to clarify it as the original one wouldn't make much sense where outside of its context. Indonesia cut means a cut by the Indonesian government. It does mean that if Indonesian fails to reduce their dependency (which is a highly probable outcome given real world factors such as geography and climate) prices will remain higher than much higher than previous given the extra competition in the market for Australian cattle. Indonesia realistically will never be able to produce the necessary amount for self sufficiency and should look at other methods for addressing the issue such as purchasing Australian cattle stations or addressing the trade deficit by increasing exports to Australia."

It's how he got into government and with things turning sour for him nationalist policy is a safe bet if not a good economic one. After all greater self sufficiency was a part of his platform I just envisioned it being enacted a little differently. Right now with all the protectionist policy he's scaring off too much foreign investment which is what was previously helping grow the economy, that and the growth of domestic consumption which is also being affected by the rising inflation.  No worries about downvotes, that's the nature of Reddit and sometimes people just don't like the news or the topic so they downvote it."

Very well produced period drama, especially considering that it's on a relatively unknown channel. Rectify. Closest thing to Mad Men now that that show has ended. It's a character study drama. Very well written and acted. But it's very slow-paced and don't go in expecting plot twists and heightened drama a la Breaking Bad, you'll be disappointed. The Strain. Alternative to The Walking Dead. Not as good in terms of everything except the concept. The special effects are kinda poor, the acting is all over the place and the action set pieces aren't very engaging. Not even sure why I keep watching it. Sense8. New drama on Netflix. The premise is very interesting. About a bunch of people all over the world that can feel and see each other spontaneously. The vibe of the show reminds me of Heroes. I've only watched until episode 7 currently, the writing isn't the best thing in the world and I've read reviews saying there  isn't any pay-offs through-out the season, even after all the build-ups. But I'll still keep on watching because I have faith it's gonna be good next season. Jane the virgin. It's like those Latin telenovelas with a modern twist. Very funny and even as a guy I can enjoy it very much. A good show to watch when I just want to switch my brain off. Halt and catch fire. Great acting, can't go wrong with Lee Pace (and damn, he's good looking as all hell). The audience reception for this one is kinda split. Some like it, some don't, I'm in the former camp that likes it. Banshee. Non-stop actions (and they are awesome actually) and sex scenes.

The other thing is that the laptop comes with A LOT of bloatware so I'd recommend to format immediately and just install the necessary drivers.

indonesia,3dpzka,TempeTahu,2,Sun Jul 19 07:44:44 2015 UTC,Mormon/LDS is not really a cult though.  Joseph Smith is long dead and they don't have a Godlike leader.

Subud - Susila Budi Utomo - interestingly international semi-kejawen meditation club   Definitely debatable if they are a cult.   Mormon/LDS and Jehovah's witness do have branches in Indonesia   Also highly debatable.   Plus countless number of people who follow individual dukuns/magic healers like Ki Joko Bodo or Ponari   AFAIK, they don't actively seek followers. Can they be called cult leaders?

indonesia,3dcd1l,vbking69,11,Wed Jul 15 04:09:10 2015 UTC,"Can't help much but I'll try.  Ubud is a good start, you can use it as a base to asks your fellow travelers and plan your trip. can you ride a motorbike? if you can, I think that is the best option. Make sure you have international driving license and please ride safely, don't copy the locals; avoid the highway if you can, the speeding trucks and buses can be scary while changing lane.  Explore Ubud for a day or two with your bike to acclimatize you with the Bali's street and locals' style of driving. You may try to go as far as Tampak Siring, there is Pura Tirta Empul to visit and Tampaksiring presidential palace, but you can't enter the palace at will.  Next you may visit Eastern part of Bali first. Start with Kintamani area, there is Batur Lake to visit; and then you may visit Pura Besakih, one of the most revered temple in Bali. As for the beach, there is a white sand beach called Virgin Beach in Jasri, Karangasem. I went there twice, at first it was only us, some locals, and a few foreigners. It was like a mini secluded paradise; but for the second time, there are domestic tourists that pretty much kill the vibe. I hope it didn't went downhill.    After that, go north to Singaraja, the capital of Buleleng regency. The  city itself is not too touristy but it was the old capital of Bali, you may want to get the feeling of the city for half a day.  I'd recommend you to get accommodation in Lovina, like ~15 kilometers west of Singaraja, not in the city itself. In Lovina, at dawn you may ride the boat to see the dolphins. The locals there usually offered you the ride, but it's best to make the arrangement with the place you stay so the will wake you up. After the dolphins, you may want to go to Banjar Hot Springs in the westerly direction of Lovina. Morning is the best since the place is not  yet full, 7 a.m. is great.   Then go south via Bedugul, the road is built upon hills so be careful.  You may want to stop at Lake Beratan and visit Bedugul Botanical Garden.  From there, it's the usual South Bali, the touristy one. Have a look at temples, Pura Tanah Lot in Tabanan is good at sunset but it's touristy, so is Pura Uluwatu. Museum Bali in Denpasar city is a good place to get some insight about culture, it's a public museum so it's kinda 'okay'.  for accomodation options, I think there are plenty on AirBnB. Get yourself a local prepaid number to arrange the accommodation or any other contingencies while travelling."

indonesia,3dcd1l,setzz,3,Thu Jul 16 02:54:20 2015 UTC,"Just to add from other posters:   You may consider a local car and driver, they are not as expensive as one would think.  Bali is generaly small enough to go on daytrips in most cases, but if spending a considerable amount of time it probably would pay to stay local. If you're going to beaches - if avoiding hordes, look for private resorts (some of them aren't expensive at all, you can ask the driver if you are hiring one, or your hotel reception). Example: I like Karmakandara, but not Bvulgari."

I would also try to stay in hole in the wall sort of places. Off the main strips is where the Balinese actually live.  Don't even set foot in Kuta. Honestly, I would skip Ubud except for perhaps a daytrip. It's overrun with tourists now after Eat Pray Love. The north and west sides of the island are far less touristy but maybe at the cost of points of interest. If you're looking for daily life though, I'd say stay far away from the south.  Good luck!

But since the couple on said picture is non-Indonesian, I highly doubt that he can give any legality on it.  But, you can do the ""ceremony"" this way, once you go back to home you could just finalize it in city hall. Most Indonesian wedding is this way anyway. Nikahan with a Penghulu (for legality, papers, etc) and after that the Resepsi where pretty much the celebration, etc takes place."

Since they're foreigners & appear to be a couple, my guess is it was a traditional procession for spiritual/formality purpose and most likely not enough to be a legally binding marriage (if you're Indonesian, you have to be married religiously before you can get a legal marriage certificate). The couple could've done it merely because it's ""exotic"" or whatever they think of it through white people's perspective or they could've actually adapted the local Hindu beliefs as their personal beliefs.

Some companies will favor those coming from certain state unis (e.g. ITB, UGM, UI etc.) however companies in general are fully aware that those unis do not guarantee good employees. Most of the time, as long as it is a reputable uni that you are enrolled in, be it state or private, you should be alright. It will also depend on (if you're a fresh graduate) your grades and other skill sets you may have (programming languages, experiences during interning at companies, languages you are fluent at, etc.).   It really comes down to how you apply yourself at your Uni and learn as much skills relevant to your chosen field/ desired occupation.  Another possibility you can look at is education overseas. Try search for scholarships. Trust me, living abroad will broaden your horizons and really open your mind. You will be able to see things from a different perspective.  Or worst case, you can always try again next year.  In any case you should chill a little. From what I can see, your English is very good. You seem to be able to create a decent narrative with good flow and choosing proper words. To me, this demonstrates good thought processes. Keep on developing that, it will serve you well in the future."

When I was searching for job, when I applied to some companies (Corporate and BUMN) and called for interview or test, I found some from state uni, others from private uni, no difference. The fact that I met them means they passed the administration test as well, and if you can pass it, from then on, it's all about what you've done and learnt while you were in uni, and whether you, as a person, can impress the interviewer or not.     If you cannot find a job, it's more like, [1] Your target is too high, yet no skill & experience to back that up, [2] You don't search hard enough, [3] You waste your time in uni, leaving you with a bleak CV (assume you're fresh grad, it's not weird that you have no work exp, but if it's added with no skill whatsoever, no organization/etc experience, low GPA... well...)"

Being an employee isn't the only way for you to making money, being a businessman also one of the way for making money. Indonesia isn't the only place for you to making money, you live in a freaking planet, which is god damn huge, there's a lot of opportunities for you out there.  Place where you'll studying isn't going to decide your life. You are the one who made the differences and hanging out with a right people will also contribute for your future.

But she inspired a love of Spanish and languages in general in me. After high school I studied Arabic for two years. I majored in Spanish literature in university. I studied abroad in Spain where I met my boyfriend four years ago. I joined the Peace Corps because I wanted to learn another language and ended up in Indonesia, teaching English.

The only way I got through was when the TA marked the papers. When she found out what happened, she took it upon herself to interrogate the TA on why he let me pass her class. She didn't hold back, questioned my attendance, assignments, midterm and finals. All of which the TA had records of my marks.    She's had numerous run-ins with other students, the worst one is when a colleague wasn't able to make an exam date due to his dad passed away. She point blank said ""not my problem.""

The way I see your comment is that you think the government needs to investigate past atrocities before the government can fix the current discrimination. However, I think it is not necessary. I think the government can actually stop current discrimination without investigating the past.    Yup, because current discrimination is the direct result of past atrocities.

Furthermore, I don't see how knowing more about the past can actually stop the current discrimination. Maybe we will find out that xxx was behind the massacre, then what will we do? xxx might already dead, or maybe too old.   Because those who don't learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. Indonesia is suffering from a culture of impunity. You can practically get away with murder in Indonesia, as long as you have money power. Why? Because past atrocities have never been studied objectively and transparently.   Who was responsible for 65-66 massacres? The west Kalimantan massacre? Tanjung Priok shooting? Lampung? Aceh? Papua? East Timor? College student kidnappings and shootings in 98? Riots in May 98? Subsequent shootings in Jakarta of college students in 98? Conflicts in Sampit, Sambas, Poso, Maluku, Flores, Banyuwangi, etc etc etc. Nobody knows because the government has never had the will to investigate those things. Culture of impunity.  And the cycle will continue. Every time there is a crisis in Indonesia, whether political or economic, there is always a possibility that things will turn violent. Why? Because people, in the government or outside it, are not afraid to turn to violence as past atrocities have never been fully investigated."

We all know the who are the victims.    Really? Is there any official investigation and tally up on the number of victims? How many people died exactly? How many simply fled and never return?    Now, what we should do is to prevent the same thing from happening again.    To answer this, we need to answer the above.   Because I feel like the government will not succeed.    Your feelings are just that. Feelings. They don't necessarily have any connection to reality or relevance outside your own self. Try not to argue based on merely on feelings.

Very disingenuous.   I only not reply your last point because I think my previous point has replied your last point.   But do we know what caused the massacre?   Every massacre is pretty much about a group that think the other group is wrong. Thus, lack of tolerance.   Did local or national politics have anything to do with it?  If a massacre happens in a country, both local and national politics were to blame, whether for involvement or lack of involvement.  Were the attacks spontaneous or directed? If yes, by who? Did the local security forces do their job properly?   If the attacks are directed, should the government just focus on a directed attacks and do nothing to prevent from spontaneous attack? No. It doesn't matter how the attack occurs, the government or society needs to learn to defend from the worst scenario. Of course it is good to know, but it is not a necessity. By who? Maybe by ucok, but he might be dead already. We can't even punish him anymore. Again, it is good to know to the extent of the completion of history, not a solution for future problem. Of course the security doesn't do a good job. If they do, the massacre won't happen.    Really? Is there any official investigation and tally up on the number of victims? How many people died exactly? How many simply fled and never return?   People died. It doesn't matter what race or ethnics. It doesn't matter how many people died. Massacre is always wrong.   Your feelings are just that. Feelings. They don't necessarily have any connection to reality or relevance outside your own self. Try not to argue based on merely on feelings.   You asked me whether I am afraid or not. Fear is a feeling. If you don't want to know what I feel, don't ask about it. I might as well stop using the word ""think"" because it is just a thought, and ""believe"" because it is just beliefs. The important thing is that I provide arguments/proofs for my feelings/thoughts/beliefs. It doesn't matter what words I use. Complaining people choice of words just make you sound like a jerk just so you know.   The government never investigated Soeharto's corruption. Remember the leaked recording of that phone conversation between Habibie and Andhi Galib? As a result we now have many more mini Suhartos.   I am not really sure about that. I remember clearly though, that Soeharto was asked to go to court, but he was too sick, and he never go to court because he died.    Suharto and his closest circle have impunity. People now don't hesitate to engage in corruption because they see how he and his family and friends largely went unpunished.    They keep doing corruption, because they see their other current politicians didn't get punished for corruption. Now, if the government manage to punish one current corrupter severely, others would think twice before doing corruption. Again, it sounds ridiculous if the judge says ""I sentence Soeharto to death for his crime!""    Even Tommy Suharto only spend a couple years in prison for deliberately planning the murder of a chief justice. He even got to impregnate his wife behind bars.   Well, he can't be charged for the same crime twice.   Because treating black people badly and discriminating people based on gender and sexual preference used to be legal. Killing people and stealing public funds have always been illegal.   And killing jews was also legal, it doesn't make it right. Many government also make a law that favor individuals. Something legal doesn't make it right.    I did. I listed all those atrocities as proofs that as long as history is not set straight, Indonesia is doomed to keep repeating the same thing.   You really haven't. How can knowing the number of victims prevent the next massacre? Also, the history is really good enough for us to make a better decision. We also can learn from other countries' history.   This is beyond ridiculous. If we don't set the records straight, those victims will always be stigmatized and prone to intimidation and extortion. We set the records straight by investigating the past properly.   I told you. Black/women/gay don't try to straight the past records (maybe yes, but not so much). Instead, they try to straight the future records.  I want to add that our current government is incapable of catching corrupter with many proofs, how can you ask them to catch bad guys from the past with fewer proofs?   And please, do me the courtesy of responding to all my points. Like I do with yours. Don't just cherry pick your answer. Very disingenuous.

For things like blurring cleavage, well that's definitely down to the interpretation of those guidelines, isn't it?

She said that any couple who went to Bali will break up if they are not meant to be together. She said it's because Bali is holy land. Just like some places in Japan. She suggested me to go with my S/O to go before we get married so that it won't be too late to break it off if we are actually not meant to be together. I don't believe it though. I think couple break up after a trip because they find out more about each other personality during the trip.

Ghusl is mandatory for any adult Muslim after having sexual intercourse, orgasmic discharge (e.g. semen),   completion of the menstrual cycle,   giving birth, and death by natural causes.   Islam also recommends (i.e. it is mustahab) the performance of the full ablution before the Friday sermon prayer   and Eid  prayers, before entering the ehram, in preparation for hajj,  after having lost consciousness,  and after formally converting to Islam. Shia Muslims also perform the ablution before Namaz-e-tawbah.  Ghusl should not be confused with wudu, a partial ablution, that Muslims perform before prayer salat.

But it is important to note that Jusuf Kalla himself is not participating in the killing, though he is one of the strongmen behind Pemuda Pancasila. I don't know about his current stance towards PP though.  On the other hand, Indonesians would-be terrorist ormas would not do killing, as killing will escalate things and force police or government intervention, while they are content with their business models to strong-arming shops, ""secure"" parking spots, or cleaning squatters from big property developers land or property. They may also engage in extorting bars, billiard places, cafes, massage parlors, etc. but they will not engage in killing.  After all, it's Ramadhan, and recently their leader have said that it is OK for its members to ask for ""donation"" to companies as it is the duty of the company to ""donate"" to filthy ormas as the part of the CSR."

A game where you pick an indonesian ghost like pocong,  kuntialanak,  buto ijo  or any other indonesian ghost or monster and you go on a quest to gain control of the spirit realm and then later doninate the human realm.

Simply because these parameters is explicitly mentioned  than in the christianity  noSARA  ""Unlike most other major religions, Islam is a rules-based system explicitly affording detailed rules and guidelines for crafting a successful and just economic system, good governance, respect for human rights, freedom of choice and protection under a specified code of law, and the code by which to manage external relations (with non- Muslims). Therefore, the task of creating an Islamicity Index is easier than constructing a “Catholicity Index.” While Western countries have, by and large and to differing degrees, advocated and adopted the principle that there should be a separation between church and state to promote social justice, religious freedom and good governance, this is problematic for countries that profess Islam. Islam, while advocating freedom of choice and freedom of religious practice, gives its followers much more detailed rules of conduct than Christianity, including a legal code, and the details for governance by the state and for management of economic and social affairs. Therefore, separating Islam [the religion] from the state is somewhat more problematic for a country that calls itself Islamic as compared top a country that embraces Christianity. """

They don't get to choose what to believe, they aren't taught to be objective and critical. They don't have any option but to follow their parents belief. Isn't that also ""Islamisasi""?  See this behavior has been going on for ages. People can't be objective at all about their faith and belief, how can they be objective? They don't even know why they believe their belief, For example:   only 20% of christians actually read the bible. Source the only legitimate book of Quran is in Arabic, translated versions aren't legitimate. But only 15% of muslim population speak Arabic. Source. The others only know how to recite the Quran but don't fully understand them. Of course there are some exceptions, but let's say we have 5% outside of the population who did study Arabic. It still leaves 80% of muslim population who don't even know what they are reciting about.   See these people got their belief either from their parents or people around them. And they don't even know fully why they follow those teachings. How can they be objective if they don't even understand what their religions are really about. They don't even get to taste the other religions how can they say that they are the right ones?  This kind of herd mentality breeds ignorance and aggressive even violent behavior or what you call fanaticism. They view the other religions through their strongly negative perception. If God is really fair, this behavior is far from what God calls ""just"".  And they reek of insecurity. Look at them, getting all sensitive when someone verbally attacks their belief. Only insecure people behave like that. You know why? Because they treat their religions as their tickets to heaven. People from less ""heaven and hell"" religion like Buddhist aren't that aggressive, because it doesn't teach heaven and hell concept like Islam and Christian do. Muslims and Christians are scared of hell so much that any theological attack that might rip off their tickets to heaven will be treated so seriously."

But you do not necessarily have to wear gamis Arab. You can wear sarung and or other clothes as long as it complies with the syariah. Arabic people, who happen to be muslims in majority, somehow like to make conflicts among themselves. You can see that between sunni and syiah. This is not Islam way. And this attitude also does not fit with our culture (especially javanese). NU are based on sunni. They also see that syiah is not the right way.

Islam prohibits alcohol and gambling, while the Arabs used to drink alcohol and gamble in the past.  I think it is clear that Islam and Arab culture are different. It is just that Islam started off from Arabian region that people are getting confused between both of them.  Regarding the Syiah news you brought, I think there is a misunderstanding here. 'Islam Nusantara' term is coined by NU people, and of course it is based on what NU have been practicing so far. And my opinion is based on what NU people do.  Do NU people oppress Syiah? Do they take violence against Ahmadiyah?   That is why they bring up 'Islam Nusantara' to the people. We, Indonesian people, are used to live in heterogeneous condition in peace. The attitude to oppress others like Syiah/Ahmadiyah people, which your links pointing out, is a habit of Arab people, which has nothing to do with Islam. And it is not suitable with our characters as well as Indonesians.   Hence, by stating 'Islam Nusantara', I think they are trying to implicitly saying to Muslims in Indonesia not to bring stuffs from Arabic countries blindly and applies it here."
indonesia,3cf66q,plesir,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:10:28 2015 UTC,"It is just that Islam started off from Arabian region that people are getting confused between both of them.   I'm not confusing them, but that is one element of Arab culture that was introduced into Indonesia via Islam. You can completely trace it back to the general middle eastern dislike of pigs. It's like certain European habits were introduced to South America or Africa via Christianity. Even if they were packaged as part of the religion you can still trace the origin.   That is why they bring up 'Islam Nusantara' to the people. We, Indonesian people, are used to live in heterogeneous condition in peace. The attitude to oppress others like Syiah/Ahmadiyah people, which your links pointing out, is a habit of Arab people, which has nothing to do with Islam. And it is not suitable with our characters as well as Indonesians.    I get that there are different schools of thought. But it kind of feels like a ""no true scotsman"" argument. If an Indonesian muslim attacks someone for being different, therefore they are not a true Indonesian muslim. It's just a line that constantly moves to put all the bad people in one category and all the good people in another. If one of the good people does something bad, it's because they were always one of the bad people apparently."

Anyhow this whole attacking others with differences from majority is not exclusively Indonesian nor must be induced by specific religion.  Men has been always trying to prosecute, blame or at the very least discredit what they do not understand. This is especially true on large homogenous society. Don't quote me on this but I faintly recall I have read this as an hypothesis on a social sciences publication.  Current Indonesian situation is rather similar to how old western civilization used to see non christian as heretics.

In elementary schools in Central and East Java (not sure about other regions) it is taught that to the Wali Sanga (""Nine Saints"";the mostly foreign saints who spread Islam to Java) had to ""modify"" their Islamic teachings a little to make it more agreeable to the Javanese. Hence, we had a figure like Sunan Kalijaga (one of the aforesaid Wali Sanga), who was a great Muslim Saint but also a Dalang (a puppet master who narrates Wayang, Javanese puppet show that commonly relates the two Hindu epics Mahabharata and Ramayana), a building which is sort of a combination of a pura and a masjid, etc.  This, of course, makes Islam as it is practised in Java a bit different from Islam in, say, Sumatra or Malaysia."

This is a huge simplification, but the Protestant reformation can be viewed as a movement to ""purify"" Christianity from the excesses of the Catholic church. Practices such as selling indulgences, veneration of the Saints, the highly political and rigid nature of the Catholic church, etc. The reformation movement was an attempt to go back to the simpler and purer Christianity. One that is based only on what's written in the Bible.  IMO, the reformation has more in common (at least superficially) with the modernist Islam movement."

indonesia,3cf66q,J0HNY0SS4RI4N,2,Wed Jul 8 13:06:48 2015 UTC,"NU is the bigger organization but from my observation they do not have quite a presence in the middle class and pns/teacher compared to Muhammadiyah, my dad is a Muhammadiyah member, he's a teacher, and i've also seen that most teacher in high school/middle school, pns, police and military are more into the muhammadiyah type than nu type.   I think what a lot of people in this sub do is to mistake the increasing religiosity of the Indonesian muslim population with an increase of extremism.    no, we are not that simple, increasing religiosity is not the problem, the problem is that a certain narrative is proposed as one and only possible answer to all the problem in the world and this come in varying tone the harshest is the kind that what baasyir preached, the least is like what was shown in para pencari tuhan, idk whether you are a muslim or not, but as a person who comes from a islamic family whose parent are former santri, i've known these kind of narrative had been around for so long, even before the fall of suharto, however the recent exploding popularity of islamism had it's concern too, negotiating with intelligent people is is easier than negotiating with muscle oriented mob which takes certain sermon at face value and building echo chamber that blocks out critical thinking"
indonesia,3cf66q,Herodriver,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:22:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, NU is an organization established by village kyais. So their market is the rural population. Muhammadiyah has always targeted the urban trader/artisan community, which include civil servants and the military.  I'm not from a muslim background, but I don't think the fact that there is a certain narrative should necessarily mean that NU's more tolerant brand of Islam will loose out in the near future. From I've learned, there is a high degree of intellectual vitality and dynamism within NU's younger generation. This will ensure their brand of Islam will keep thriving in Indonesia.  Extremist Islam has always been present in Indonesia, far before the current situation we have. From the Padri War to the rebellion of DI/TII."
indonesia,3cf66q,humanisme,0,Wed Jul 8 13:45:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's considered as reformation,more as a reminder that Islam came to Nusantara through peaceful means like trade and cultural assimilation.Unlike the bloody conquest that happened in Persia or India subcontinent.They're trying to remind the local Muslims that the type of Islam here is those who can respect cultural difference and non Islamic laws,also not as strict as Muhammad does.  Politically,I kinda support this type of Islam,although technically they're still heavily influenced by the Arabs."
indonesia,3cf66q,J0HNY0SS4RI4N,-6,Tue Jul 7 21:02:40 2015 UTC,"""Islam melebur dengan budaya tersebut karena pendekatan dakwah di Nusantara ini pendekatan budaya, bukan senjata seperti di Timur Tengah.

indonesia,3cf66q,whizzwr,2,Tue Jul 7 14:37:15 2015 UTC,It's historical fact. Same with Christianity.
indonesia,3cf66q,Herodriver,2,Wed Jul 8 12:03:00 2015 UTC,"Well, fortunately Islam came to Indonesia through trading; less bloody than how Muhammad did it. That's what NU is trying to preserve, IMO. It's not a bad thing, but it's just creating another sect within Islam. That means more conflicts and No True Scotsman fallacies to throw around.   There were things about Muhammad's history that I was not taught at middle school, but even after that censorship, it was certainly still violent. So I don't get why senjata seperti di timur-tengah can't be related to Muhammad. Did he spread Islam using candy bars or what? I mean at least Isa was a fuckin' hippie. Was the Islam that was taught to me not the true Islam? How can I know? How can anybody know?"

indonesia,3cf66q,zahrul3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:00:59 2015 UTC,"Muslim conquests:       According to traditional accounts, the Muslim conquests (Arabic: الغزوات‎, al-Ġazawāt or Arabic: الفتوحات الإسلامية‎, al-Futūḥāt al-Islāmiyya) also referred to as the Islamic conquests or Arab conquests,  began with the Islamic prophet Muhammad in the 7th century. He established a new unified polity in the Arabian Peninsula which under the subsequent Rashidun (The Rightly Guided Caliphs) and Umayyad Caliphates saw a century of rapid expansion of Muslim power.  They grew well beyond the Arabian Peninsula in the form of a Muslim empire with an area of influence that stretched from the borders of China and India, across Central Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, Sicily, and the Iberian Peninsula, to the Pyrenees. Edward Gibbon writes in The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire:  Under the last of the Umayyads, the Arabian empire extended two hundred days journey from east to west, from the confines of Tartary and India to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. And if we retrench the sleeve of the robe, as it is styled by their writers, the long and narrow province of Africa, the solid and compact dominion from Fargana to Aden, from Tarsus to Surat, will spread on every side to the measure of four or five months of the march of a caravan. We should vainly seek the indissoluble union and easy obedience that pervaded the government of Augustus and the Antonines; but the progress of Islam diffused over this ample space a general resemblance of manners and opinions. The language and laws of the Quran were studied with equal devotion at Samarcand and Seville: the Moor and the Indian embraced as countrymen and brothers in the pilgrimage of Mecca; and the Arabian language was adopted as the popular idiom in all the provinces to the westward of the Tigris.  The Muslim conquests brought about the collapse of the Sassanid Empire and a great territorial loss for the Byzantine Empire, eventually also resulting in its collapse. The reasons for the Muslim success are hard to reconstruct in hindsight, primarily because only fragmentary sources from the period have survived. Most historians agree that the Sassanid Persian and Byzantine Roman empires were militarily and economically exhausted from decades of fighting one another. The rapid fall of Visigothic Spain remains less easily explicable.  Some Jews and Christians in the Sassanid Empire and Jews and Monophysites in Syria were dissatisfied and welcomed the Muslim forces, largely because of religious conflict in both empires,  while at other times, such as in the Battle of Firaz, Arab Christians allied themselves with the Persians and Byzantines against the invaders.   In the case of Byzantine Egypt, Palestine and Syria, these lands had only a few years before being reacquired from the Persians, and had not been ruled by the Byzantines for over 25 years.  Fred McGraw Donner, however, suggests that formation of a state in the Arabian peninsula and ideological (i.e. religious) coherence and mobilization was a primary reason why the Muslim armies in the space of a hundred years were able to establish the largest pre-modern empire until that time. The estimates for the size of the Islamic Caliphate suggest it was more than thirteen million square kilometers (five million square miles), making it larger than all current states except the Russian Federation.

Arabic sounding names are seen as more Muslim, and sometimes muallafs like to take on Islamic sounding names after they converted ( see Muhammad Ali, et al). However, even though names like Muhammad David or Alexander Malik still raises a few questioning looks, Indonesians are decidedly much more relaxed about the whole naming bit. I had (Indon muslim) friends named Devi and Chitra  who told me the Pakistanis freak out when they hear their names because 'that's only for Hindus!'.  Oh by the way, Saiful Bahri (Saif-al-Bahri) I think syncretically translates to roughly Sword of the Ocean, senpai sword of the crescent moon taught me that, PBUH.

indonesia,3cadz3,faketruth,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:29:12 2015 UTC,"Fitna (film):       Fitna (Arabic: فِتْنَة‎) is a 2008 short film by Dutch parliamentarian Geert Wilders. Approximately 17 minutes in length, the film attempts to demonstrate that the Qur'an motivates its followers to hate all who violate Islamic teachings. The movie shows selected excerpts from Suras of the Qur'an, interspersed with media clips and newspaper cuttings showing or describing acts of violence and/or hatred by Muslims.  The film argues that Islam encourages – among other things – acts of terrorism, antisemitism, violence against women, violence and subjugation of infidels and against homosexuals and Islamic universalism. A large part of the film details the influence of Islam on the Netherlands. The film was published on the Internet in 2008.   Shortly before its release, its announcement was suspended from its website by the American provider because of the perceived controversy.   It stirred a still continuing debate in the Netherlands as well as abroad,  and a criminal prosecution for hate speech.  The Arabic title-word ""fitna"" means ""disagreement and division among people"" or a ""test of faith in times of trial"".  Wilders, a prominent critic of Islam, described the film as ""a call to shake off the creeping tyranny of Islamisation"".   On 27 March 2008, Fitna was released to the Internet on the video sharing website LiveLeak in Dutch and English versions. The following day, LiveLeak removed the film from their servers, citing serious threats to their staff. On 30 March, Fitna was restored on LiveLeak following a security upgrade, only to be removed again shortly afterwards by Wilders himself because of copyright violations. A second edition was released later.    Image i     Relevant: War against Islam | Aslim Taslam | Beyond Fitna   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Yes it is true that for too long our government abandon infrastructure developments there (although it is not just Papua, but also applies to the rest of Indonesia minus Jakarta. Even in Java island, you can easily find some underdeveloped regions). Since otonomi daerah, Papua's local government receives huge amount of money from pusat as the form of financial decentralization. What what do they do? Do they really use it to promote local people's welfare? Do they use it to develop roads, schools, hospitals?

That means any photograph taken of such a work during the copyright period is a derivative work.   A derivative work usually requires a license from the creator of the work. However, in many (but not all) countries there is an exception in copyright law which eliminates the need for a license. We call this exception freedom of panorama (FOP), a phrase derived from the German term Panoramafreiheit.  so, yeah, i'm with OP,which law .__. and there seems to be no implementation of it"
indonesia,3c8eg3,somethinghaha,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:48:58 2015 UTC,probably because architecture is covered as a copyrighted creation. didnt see any exception to it so yeah no public space rules here.  funny since we copied the whole copyright law from either germany or japan (forgot which one exactly).

Go to Atma Jaya or Brawijaya instead. Or anything that is not Surya. If you insist, please for the love of yourself don't go to its Neuroscience submajor.  Want some explanation? Well:   Oh, so you heard all the awesome academia who are in Surya? Let me tell you: you will almost never see, or straight out never see them. Onno Purbo? Once in a blue moon. Taruna Ikrar? Almost everyone never saw, or will ever see him. He's still in the USA, with absolutely no sign of returning. Sidrotun Naim? Will be leaving in a month or 2 (She's awesome though, we knew each other pretty well). Hell, Yohanes Surya himself only comes to the campus (which is currently a rented building, BTW) when VVIP guests come to give a talk. A horrible mess of mismanagement in the start has made SU comes to its knees. At the early days, lots of money goes to research centres... in which most of them does nothing. Because centres has been running without any clear goal or progress, a lot of them have been closed down, and the head of the respective centres got fired. All that money went to waste. Oh, and because there was relatively less money invested in the actual teaching, some classes, mostly the labs, are struggling. Surya is running out of money, and struggling to get people to enroll. Not good. Lecturers welfare be damned. At one point, they were not being paid for more than 6 months (I forgot the exact time, it's around 6-8 months). This caused a lot of consequences: a lot of the lecturers and staff members resigned, or going to resign (There's a rumour about every single one of Chemical Engineering lecturers are going to resign). For the ones who chose to stay, it's even worse; they have to teach multiple subjects in one semester. I'm talking about 10-15 SKS of teaching. Most of the major only got C on their accreditation. I'm lucky to be in the one who got B, though (There goes my money....) So, you insist to enroll? If so, welcome to hell. 160 SKS, with 5-week inter-semester break MAX.

Inside the university though, English is the lingua franca.  Though to be honest it depends on what kind of environment you live in. If you like to hang around the ""local"" places like the traditional HK restaurant, then Cantonese is a must to interact properly with them. But if you go to the high-class/white-washed places (bars, expensive stores and restaurants, etc) everyone speaks English there.  As for mandarin, I do speak it, but local Hong Kong people don't really like the mainland people (and neither do I), so I try not to speak in Mandarin because I'm afraid they might wrongly recognize me as a mainlander. Since I'm ethnically Chinese, I got mistaken for either Japanese, Taiwanese, Hong Konger, or Mainlander a lot.

I see many tourists at the airport these days, some women wear ""provocative"" clothing with tank tops and shorts and theyre fine.  Although from what Ive seen they get away with it mostly because they head straight for the port and go to Sabang for a holiday.  In town I highly suggest not to wear that, but its not as strict as you think.  Most of the ethnic chinese here wear shorts up to your knee and dont wear a headscarf so you should be fine, albeit your clothing options are limited.  The town is getting increasingly open these days.  Outside of Banda Aceh Ive seen foreigners without headscarf, but wear fully covered clothing (pants up to your feet and sleeves up to your elbows).

From what I've seen here in Banda Aceh it doesn't seem to be fully implemented or enforced, many of the ethnic Chinese don't follow the Muslim dress code and I'm sure they all still drink albeit out of the public eye.  However in the more conservative and rural regions like in the Central and Southwest regions it would be more heavily enforced towards non-Muslims, although if I were to venture a guess I'm sure the Shariah police would turn a blind eye given enough money."

Banda Aceh wasn't a place either of us would want to spend much time in, although the history of the tsunami that has been preserved here is very interesting. It was a charming enough city, and the reason for not sticking around has less to do with Sharia law and more because it is just another small Sumatran city.   You should make straight for Pulau Wei, which is where most people go in this area for beaches and coral. I'd recommend wearing a headscarf when you are first arriving in Banda Aceh and ferrying over to Pulau Wei, but it is unlikely that you will deal with any sort of Sharia problems or Islamic restrictions despite the reputation. The ""worst"" parts of Aceh are mostly confined to the people that live there, and in the more rural, untouristed parts of northern Sumatra.   In case you are of that certain persuasion of backpacker, I'd also mention that although marijuana is more plentiful in this part of the country, you'd be better off not trying it here."

indonesia,3c32lq,Hamasaki_Fanz,4,Sat Jul 4 07:58:54 2015 UTC,Do you use Telkom Speedy / Indihome as your ISP?  Telkom apply different way to filter website based on region. Some region apply DNS queries routing and others already applied IP filtering.  It seems that your region already applied IP filtering. That's why you can't use DNSCrypt while your friend may still able to use it to bypass Internet Positif.  The best way to bypass IP filtering is by using VPN. Just subscribe to a trustworthy VPN provider and have nothing to worry about.

If that happens and you forget that you added this to /etc/hosts, you'll be very puzzled; you'd think that reddit.com is down. You can check if it is really down at http://isup.me/reddit.com  You can even do it on Windows. You just have to find the hosts file."

So for example you have worked at the dildo factory as a tester for several years and have put some money in the JHT program. Dildo factory closes and you can't find any work. For low income workers even the small amount of JHT money would mean a lot just to pay the bills, or perhaps open a small warung. Now you are strapped for cash (and jobless) and have to wait at least 10 years just to cash out 10% and then reach 56 years old or die just to get the rest of your money."

Feedback has been really slow, so I'm inviting the people in here to participate in r/indonesia's design closely. If you have ideas on how the design needs to be, wants to try out the upcoming private alpha tests and iron out bugs, or just wanted to keep track on the development progress, you can PM me and I'll add you to the list of future alpha testers. You can then join the Slack group chat and will have access to me and discussions about the design with other testers. But if you don't want the commitment there's always the document on r/indoclone for updates and a place for throwing feedback, and also a PM to me too.  I also have two freelance jobs at the moment (yay, finally jobs!), so development time will be really slow while I work on the tasks for those jobs before focusing on Reddit again.

If there's one thing I've learned from my past relationships is this:  The reason most people get bored with their relationship isn't because they get tired with their significant other, but because they get tired of themselves pretending to be someone else for the sake of their significant other.  If enjoying to procrastinate is your biggest baggage, then I don't see the risk in revealing who you truly are. Story tiiiime: when I first started dating my current SO, I pretended to be this cool, socially-energetic, loud, and confident guy. I wasn't, and I was far from it. I couldn't keep the act up, so I told and showed her what I am. And I am eternally greatful that I was, because she turned to be just like me: casual, stay-at-home, prefer-to-watch-a-movie-in-bed kind of chick. So, most of the time, we eventually end up binge-watching Game of Thrones while snacking on junk food we bought at the Indomaret across the street."

I'd have to echo /u/deepoceanblue; moving in with him doesn't make you any more independent than you already are. Or maybe he's one of those overly-dependent guys who need constant presence and reassurance (I'm just making a conjecture here, so take that sentence with a grain of salt).

My suggestion is, if you wanna waste time, get some TV Shows. Currently binge-watching House. Just finished the 4th season of GoT (watching the 5th when I get together with the family). Or, if you're into comedy, Silicon Valley is great, as is IT Crowd and Parks and Rec (although they've ended already). Also downloading Friends."

I still enjoyed it though.   I think we watch House not because we like him as a doctor but as a guy who has strong beliefs, and doesn't enjoy taking shit from other people. I think we like House because we kinda wanna be like him once in a while.   If you do end up watch Parks and Rec, it's okay to skip season 1 and 2. First two seasons were pretty much just a bunch of guys being dicks to each other; no character development at all. Seasons 3 onwards was great."

Too good to be true, but considering I'm buying something new to the market and will probably be obsolete by the next year or two, might as well get it.  As for novelty. Android Wear's gimmick is that you use it as a notification center and a place to quickly do small things without taking your phone out (such as knowing who's actually messaging you in IMs). Apple Watch though wants to be a phone on your wrist with the apps that do everything but still need a phone.  I can ramble a lot about this smartwatch debacle."

People are suspecting that because the Jesse Jackson AmA was a disaster, reddit abruptly fired Victoria, a much loved admin also coordinator to various AmA. IAmA shut down because it needs to sort itself out from losing Victoria. The rest of subs follow because some of their own AmAs are also done with help from Victoria, some for solidarity and anger towards the company.  As for what's really happened, IAmA mod already said that the Jackson AmA has nothing to do with the firing, stating the decision was probably already been made before the incident. The frustration is more because of the abrupt nature and that there's no one is covering Victoria's work, which is apparently a lot to do with the community, at the moment."

EDIT: https://archive.is/jouWQ. post by huhaskldasdpo  The IAMA moderator victoria since 2013 calls the people that are featured in the iama to get their responses and then she posts them in an ""official account"". Other times the IAMA person might decide to respond personally to comments. Usually the reason this is done is to avoid PR nightmare.  Well people in iama were asking tough questions like why jesse jackson was a racebaiter and the replys came back as unusual as if she tried to give waterdown questions.  Apparently his PR teeam found out about the trainwreck then decided to demand the IAMA shutdown or else they would sue reddit for ""   racism and libel"" and reddit then revoked the account of victoria as a mod of iama.  Jesse jackson has been doing shakedowns for years and reddit obviously didn't want to be held to that.  What do you mean by shakedowns?  He would accuse businesses of racism and they would donate money to his ""group"" and he then walks back.   The biggest one recently was were he accused silicon valley of being racist for not having black employees and in turn they donated to him just so he would shutup. Apparently this is how he has been making money for many years."

One night, we were preparing our organization event for the next morning, setting the stage, sound and something like that. By 12pm there were 3 of us left, one of my friends came down to security office taking the keys for the auditorium/aula (our aula is at 3rd floor). 10mins later he came up, looking exhausted. He told us to hurry up.   When we reached the first floor, he told us that he saw a laptop on the 2nd floor corridor, turned on. He checked that laptop, see if that laptop is one of our friend's. He said he saw a facebook tab open and he didn't recognized the person who owned the account, that person isn't a student of Poltek, he said. 5 seconds later the browser changed tab and shutted down by itself .

As I checked into the minor kitchen, I found a white cat sitting on the isle with its eyes set upon mine. But before I could get nearer to it, the thing happened.  Our home had a black-out.  I was terrified. My squinty, lazy eyes widened in the darkness. Hyperventilating, I ran to the TV room. And there I fell down to my knees.

I'm not a 'sensitive' person and I found myself comfy enough living without knowing whatever happens on the other side or whatever, so I try to shrugged it off. I worked on my computer, and there was that feeling something is sitting next to me. I ate, I watched TV and couldn't shake it off. It got so bad that when I tried to sleep there's this cold spot next to me. I went WTF and couldn't sleep at all. Then whatever it is finally disappeared around dawn. Cold spot disappeared and I felt alone again. I thought I was crazy for a while.   I bumped into my agitated friend that afternoon and she said that she's sorry she had to asked us to move. She said she 'saw' something sitting at the back of the class and slowly moved toward us. She was so scared and was ready to just bolt before we decided to go. I asked her if she saw it following us.

indonesia,3buivp,roflpaladin,13,Thu Jul 2 06:59:01 2015 UTC,I vowed to myself not to use regular ojek ever again in my life. It has same rate as taxis... (Sometimes even more expensive). No standard rates (tarif seenak udel). They also took space of pedestrian space.  They should be more competitive. To survive/compete fairly they should join gojek or grab bike or create something similar.
indonesia,3buivp,tesna,4,Thu Jul 2 14:41:27 2015 UTC,"No standard rates (tarif seenak udel).   That is if you're thinking with corporate logic. Ojek pangkalan operates not with money alone, but with social capital.  The point of doing transaction with ojek pangkalan is the basic of informal economy:  it is defined according to your relationship with the individuals. If you're stranger, things can get expensive. If you're known, it can be extremely cheap. You can't apply urban, corporate logic where price is fixed and transaction is impersonal in informal economy.   They should be more competitive. To survive/compete fairly they should join gojek or grab bike or create something similar.   You're comparing a corporate with local communities here. One ojek pangkalan in Pancoran has no price influence whatsoever with another pangkalan in Manggarai. You can't ask them to ""compete"" when the capital is clearly larger in Gojek side, as a corporation. Not to mention ojek pangkalan is not organized in the same way as Gojek does."
indonesia,3buivp,xaliber,4,Fri Jul 3 08:01:21 2015 UTC,"well, if regular ojek cannot create apps, they should join them (gojek/grab bike). those old fashioned/inefficient/monopoly way should be extinct. it's a free market, if you can't compete fairly they should be extinct.   gimana bisa mau maju kalau ga bisa mengikuti perkembangan jaman?  taxis is also similar. I remember when bluebird started to operate in bandung or bali.. a lot of complaints from other taxi drivers because people prefer to use bluebird.. because bluebird offer better service! before bluebird most taxi drivers won't turn on their meter....  More competition/choice, better for the consumers :)"
indonesia,3buivp,tesna,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:02:57 2015 UTC,"That is the problematic assumption: this is not a free market.  As said earlier, you're comparing corporate with local communities here. Free market is where everyone has more or less fair opportunities. Gojek vs ojek pangkalan is not free market: as a corporation of course Gojek fares a lot better in terms of capital and organization. This is a formal economy sector (Gojek as a corporate) coopting an informal economy (ojek pangkalan). The free market assumption does not work in this context because it is derived on  the model of formal economy - you cannot apply one assumption from one model when there are two conflicting models.  ""Perkembangan jaman"" is a notion that I don't think should always be regarded highly if we consider the Dutch colonials used the same notion of ""kemadjoean"" to dehumanize its colonial subjects. I.e., how can it be good if a corporation, out of nowhere, are coopting communities? It's not a simple case of ""more technology, better society"". By adopting Gojek apps, ojek pangkalan drivers are ascribing themselves to Gojek company, as a labor, not to the local communities in which they are their own driver.  Well, I sort of agree there needs to be a better choice for consumer (I object to your choice of word on ""monopoly"" btw as it is not exactly accurate). But it is important to underline that we sort of already have that better choice: social capital. Get to know the drivers more, bond with them. Makan di warung bareng, dilibatkan dalam acara RT bareng, kalo ojek kantor dilibatkan dalam acara/keperluan kantor. You'll get the prices cheap."
indonesia,3buivp,xaliber,5,Fri Jul 3 09:25:32 2015 UTC,"why can't we apply free market? it's better, right? drive people to do more to compete.   I was regular user of ojek... I usually took them from train station to home (less than 2km). Usually I paid IDR 10K (this is usually after asking several ojek!) The one stand by near the train station insists 15K... I had to walk a little bit further from the station to get 10K price (and eventually know several regular ojek drivers)  Then the fuel price hike happen. IDR 15K is the minimum. This is ridiculous. Then I stopped using them since then. I drive and park the car in the station, ask my wife to drive me to/from the station, use taxi if available, even driving to the office now feels cheaper than use ojek+train  (although it's not) lol. ANYTHING else but using traditional ojek."
indonesia,3buivp,tesna,3,Fri Jul 3 10:03:47 2015 UTC,I think the problem is that urban dweller doesn't have time (arguably) to haggle or they just find it a hassle. That is why they want consistency with their purchase.  I also think this is why traditional market is hurting in urbanized cities. You need to haggle & check prices instead of take and swipe with minimart/supermarket/hypermarket.

You can't ask them to ""compete"" when the capital is clearly larger in Gojek side, as a corporation. Not to mention ojek pangkalan is not organized in the same way as Gojek does.  Assuming the locals ""males ngikutin kemajuan"" follows the same colonial logic as the Dutch assume the Javanese unable to follow ""kemadjoean"". I'd say there is a need to get off the notion that more technology = better society. See the modes of production here. By adopting Gojek apps they are ascribing themselves to Gojek company, as a labor, not to the local communities in which they are their own driver.  See the drivers not as ""tukang"", as ""labors"" working their ass to serve our needs (to take us to certain point) and when the deed is done we only pay them what they require, no personal interaction. Ojek drivers should be seen as a part of community/part of neighborhood - because that's where they serve their values. Ojek pangkalan is built upon paguyuban/community and that is where hanging around (mangkal di pangkalan) serves its purpose: being present in certain geographical areas and available for others needing help in that area. Errand work like buying groceries for local mothers, help construction workers working on their projects, etc.  Do you honestly think those kind of banners OP linked are put only by the ojek pangkalan drivers themselves?"

indonesia,3buivp,EZadsko,-1,Fri Jul 3 04:43:22 2015 UTC,"You're thinking with an urban-centric, working class mindset if you see hanging around in pangkalan is wasting time.

Say, was that observation based on a passing glance or have you tried hanging out with them and  with the locals, just to see how tukang ojek perceive themselves and how people see them?"
indonesia,3buivp,ndut,2,Wed Jul 8 06:21:37 2015 UTC,"""Ribet"".  Kalau saya baca di link sih sepertinya kurang saja penjelasan dan pendidikan tentang cara kerja Gojek ke tukang2 ojek tersebut.  Ya balik lagi ke pendidikan tadi mas. Warung2 tenda dan kaki lima ga mau digusur dipindah ke tempat yang terkonsentrasi dalam bangunan gara2 ""ribet"" dan takut rugi walaupun dijelaskan berkali2 kalau bakal untung.  Implementasinya itu fantastis. saya dengar teman2 di Jakarta pada make itu sebenarnya ikut bangga karena idenya cemerlang dan menguntungkan kedua pihak. Ada yang ngeshare di WA kalau ada driver gojek yang berpenghasilan 10-jutaan. Masuk akal sekali. Ojek jalan 100 km perhari saja udah dapat penghasilan kotor 10 juta kalau kerja full 30 hari.  Mungkin yang seperti ini bisa dipromosikan ke tukang2 ojek tersebut."

Memang mereka seperti itu,tidak tangguh,tidak mudah menghadapi perubahan,tidak pintar. Kaya gitu kenapa?

indonesia,3buivp,ndut,6,Thu Jul 2 20:38:59 2015 UTC,"Ya kalo gitu alasannya gimana bisa ada dua kubu tukang ojek.. kubu yang 'menyambut gembira' inovasi dan kubu yang 'malas berubah'  Kalau satu kubu bisa kenapa yang lain gak bisa? Latar belakang sama, tukang ojek..  Apakah semua tukang ojek yang pindah ke gojek lebih berpendidikan? pernah/ lulus kuliah? Rasanya belum ada data semacam itu.. kalaupun ada mungkin mereka cuma lebih terdidik secara 'street smart' dan jeli melihat kesempatan.  Ada kok pangkalan ojek lain yang sama-sama malah tanya ke pengojek yang udah masuk gojek, caranya join gimana, terus kalo udah join secara kolektif... (gojek gak melarang anggotanya untuk kumpul di pangkalan)... Coba mereka telusuri secara rasional dan gak antipati duluan. Karena gojek sebetulnya nyatanya udah bantu banyak tukang ojek pangkalan yg lain"

Kalau di pangkalan sistemnya ngantri ganti2an,sekarang kalau satu pangkalan jadi drivers Gojek,gunanya pangkalan apa? Bubar mas"
indonesia,3buivp,xaliber,6,Fri Jul 3 03:43:20 2015 UTC,"Kebanyakan driver Go-Jek juga awalnya dari tukang ojek biasa, kok. Latar belakang ekonomi sama, latar belakang pendidikan rata-rata sama. Dari beberapa kali pengalaman pake Go-Jek, kebanyakan abangnya ngaku lebih banyak dapet order setelah gabung sama Go-Jek. Kalo di pangkalan paling sehari cuma jalan 4 kali. Apalagi kalo pangkalannya pake sistem giliran. Mengutip dari salah satu abang Go-Jek yang pernah nganter gue, ""Nih abis saya nganter mbak ke X, pasti langsung nganter orang lagi. Ordernya nggak putus. Selama saya masih kuat, saya ambil terus."""

indonesia,3buivp,xaliber,2,Fri Jul 3 03:40:35 2015 UTC,"masalahnya, jadi tukang ojek sendiri saja sudah besar penghasilan. supir bapak saya berhenti buat jadi tukang ojek di kalibata mall. padahal sistemnya merugikan menurut saya, dia harus bayar sewa pangkalan sebulan sekian ratus ribu, nah baru boleh mangkal disitu. mirip saja dengan 20-80 bagi hasil dari gojek.  tapi ya itu, memang ogah adaptasi mungkin."
indonesia,3buivp,autowikibot,7,Thu Jul 2 18:37:14 2015 UTC,"Ya Indonesia itu seperti ini. Berpendidikan rendah,cari duit susah.   nyatanya penghasilan abang2 pangkalan yang pindah ke gojek pada naik, dengan waktu kerja yang lebih efektif juga.. (on call ga pake banyak idle time nganggur), jadi membantu 'cari duit' juga  Jangan cuma bilang 'ya emang keadaan kaya gini'... kalo mentalnya belum berubah ke 'mengambil kesempatan' tapi cuma sirik ngambek dan minta kecipratan doang kalo ada orang sukses ya ini biangnya orang gak maju2...  Embrace change, or perish.. om-om umur 40/50 yg pegawai juga harus belajar komputer, toko-toko konvensional  mulai mendekati pelanggan via FB/BBM/instagram dan lain2 menghadapi saingan OL.   Dunia ini mau gak mau berubah, dan saya lihatnya justru Gojek membantu menjembatani tukang2 ojek yang tidak takut berubah."

Jangan bayangin kalau sebagian besar drivers Gojek itu hasil dari orang2 mendaftar,khususnya untuk sekarang ya  Gojek itu sudah ada sejak tahun 2011,akhir 2014 dapat suntikan dana,bikin app,merekrut drivers.  Bayangkan anda jadi tukang ojek direkrut Gojek yang penumpangnya sedikit Dan lepaa dari pangkalan (kalau Mau merambah ke anthropologist,pangkalan ojek itu sudah semacam komunitas),apa and Mau?

indonesia,3buivp,hell_crawler,3,Fri Jul 3 03:38:28 2015 UTC,"Kalo gue sih kenapa lebih suka naik gojek, karena ojek pangkalan suka sembarangan kasih tarif. Contohnya gue dari kosan ke kantor pake ojek 10 ribu, tapi dari kantor ke kosan 15 ribu. Jaraknya sama, rutenya sama, cuma beda pangkalan.   Pangkalan ojek di Satrio juga sama. Ambil contoh dari seberang Ambassador ke Jl Guru Mughni. Naik dari belokan arah Mega Kuningan ongkosnya 10 ribu, kalo kita mau jalan dikit naik ojek depan Danamon, ongkosnya 7 ribu, jalan dikit lagi ke depan apartemen Sommerset, ongkosnya bisa 5 ribu (ongkos 3 tahun lalu). Padahal jarak tiga-tiganya cuma beberapa meter.   Ada lagi yang jual mahal. Pangkalan ojek deket BEJ (kolong tangga halte busway Polda) kalo mau ke PS mintanya 35 ribu, padahal pake taxi cuma 20 ribu."
indonesia,3buivp,tapesingkong,0,Thu Jul 2 23:27:09 2015 UTC,"Well, the key to get cheap prices at ojek pangkalan is to know the tukang ojek personally. Ojek pangkalan operates on social capital, so the more you know the guy, the more you can get from him. It is the essence of informal economy."
indonesia,3buivp,bkn2tahoeng,5,Fri Jul 3 10:04:27 2015 UTC,apakah ngasih bule / orang luar kota / orang baru pindahan harga lebih mahal dari tarif yg semestinya juga bagian dari social capital? Menurut saya plus poin besarnya gojek itu ya kejelasan tarif yang tidak pandang bulu...
indonesia,3buivp,bkn2tahoeng,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:01:42 2015 UTC,"Konsep modal sosial bicara soal pola hubungan yg bs individu bentuk dgn individu lainnya, yang mana identitas sebagai ""orang baru""/""orang luar kota"" pasti punya pengaruh. Identitas ""bule"" juga. Tapi saya pikir modal tsb bisa ditanam dgn banyak bergaul sama mereka, bule sekali pun.  Betul memang Gojelk ada kejelasan tarif, dan dia tidak perlu modal sosial buat menentukan harganya. Seperti pasar2 modern macamnya alfamart, giant. Saya bukannya menolak per se konsep yg ditawarkan Gojek, tapi posisinya sbg korporat yg cenderung mengooptasi komunitas yg udah ada dan kecenderungan sebagian di reddit menggunakan logika ""semakin canggih"" = ""semakin maju"" (implikasinya: ada yg ""tidak maju"" dan ""terbelakang"")."

Although different social sciences emphasize different aspects of social capital, they tend to share the core idea ""that social networks have value"".

Transaction is personal - price and what you can do with that price is negotiated by your relationship with the man/woman.  I'd say ojek pangkalan is one among a few things that signals we're still living in a neighborhood - a local community - in such urbanscape like Jakarta.
