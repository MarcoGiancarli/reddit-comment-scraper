MotoX,3e2o07,caulkbite,25,Tue Jul 21 14:19:05 2015 UTC,"Im one of the lucky ones then, Lollipop runs fanfreakingtasic on my att 2013 moto x. Like said I wonder if its just a server error or actually problems with 5.1.  Easily can get 4-5 hours of on screen time. Of course thats when the active mobile radio drain isnt present..then its like 3 hours tops."
MotoX,3e2o07,MrRiggs,7,Tue Jul 21 14:33:49 2015 UTC,"Dunno how you manage it. Though, I realized I get much, much better battery life with quality signal. I get 1-2 bars most of the day where I live and my battery truly suffers. I'm up at 6:00 and by 14:00, I'm on the charger with less than an hour of SOT. But I spent the weekend with 4-5 bars of signal - up at 6:00 and had ~15% at 22:00 w/ ~3 hours of SOT.    But regardless of battery performance, Lollipop runs like a damn dream! Ultra smooth/buttery, snappy performance, and no more random crashes. I almost always have my 12,000mAh power bank, so the battery isn't a huge issue. Still hoping for a new Nexus 5 this fall though..."
MotoX,3e2o07,bonerfalcon,4,Tue Jul 21 14:44:20 2015 UTC,"It does depend on signal, that mobile active drain on mine is killer tho, but yea a bad signal really drains battery bc its constantly trying to connect. At home I get maybe 3 bars max and work its full speed never drops a bar at all, home its wishy washy, 2-3, 3-2, etc.. At work the screen on time is of course a little worse because Im using 4g and using snapchat, kik, firefox, youtube.. all those battery hog type apps. I still get about 3/4 hours but you know its all depending on personal use.. On screen time varies per person because you dont know how they use the phone you know.   Do you use greenify? That helps a good amount even not rooted.."

MotoX,3e2o07,thechilipepper0,6,Tue Jul 21 20:37:37 2015 UTC,Let's hope that they realized it's because of the cell standby issue and they're gonna release an update that fixes it.
MotoX,3e2o07,linuxgator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:32:49 2015 UTC,Gosh I hope so.  That would mean they'll fix XT1053 too right?
MotoX,3e2o07,superm1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:46:20 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily.  Even though the software is actually produced and distributed by Motorola, its done at the behest of the carriers.  In this case, AT&T didn't like something, so they had the distribution stopped.  It could be for any number of reasons, the cell standby bug is just one possibility.  There has also been a bug which is corrupting APN settings and is angering a lot of people because they have to do a factory reset.  Even if AT&T stops it for one of these reasons, it doesn't mean that any other carriers will get the fix.  Though if it is a critical bug that is affecting multiple models, and since the 1053 is pretty much controlled by Motorola alone, then there's a decent chance that they'll get a fix too, assuming that it is affected by the same bug.  This could also be why Verizon hasn't greenlit the update, but that of course is just speculation."

Also the phone has crashed on me a number of times. I can't remember it ever crashing on 4.4.4. Features like twist for camera don't always work. And app don't launch properly.

I'd had the phone close to 20 months, so the battery was aging quickly."
MotoX,3dwgf9,PNWoutdoors,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:01:32 2015 UTC,About a year
MotoX,3dwgf9,see__no__evil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:12:37 2015 UTC,"Hmm, then yeah I recommend continuing to track down responsible apps. I wouldn't expect your battery to drop off much in the first 12 months. One thing I do religiously is check which apps are using data in the background - either network or WiFi. Although some of my apps don't show up in the battery chart very high, they may be sending several mb data in the background every day. I've been able to extend my battery life by a bit by cracking down on background data for many apps that I don't need syncing until I open them. That's one thing you might benefit from."

MotoX,3dylqi,KillerBeeSting,3,Mon Jul 20 20:00:32 2015 UTC,"I believe the Moto X (and most Android devices) use the ext4 filesystem. Virtually all filesystems of that type (including HFS+ and NTFS on your computers) start losing massive performance on writes once they get about 85% full.  On an 11.8GB partition, you want to keep about 1.5-2GB free if you want your phone to behave well. I wish the phone vendors would report less space and use the 'reserve' feature of ext4 to reserve 20% or something, way too many people are running their phones too close to capacity."

MotoX,3dylnv,dman87,2,Mon Jul 20 18:34:11 2015 UTC,"Around 11 months back, I sent mine in to pay for a screen replacement. It was cheaper to pay Moto than to have someone do it locally. I checked first.  The first phone they sent me had an issue with the speaker phone. It would distort really easily. So, I eventually requested to have it replaced for free (I was still under warranty technically).   Overall, It wasn't too bad. I was never without a phone since they would ship me the replacement first. I was disappointed that the first replacement had issues. But, they don't send you a new one. They send you a refurb--which is okay I think."
MotoX,3dylnv,TheTechist,2,Mon Jul 20 19:46:13 2015 UTC,"The only issues with Motorola's customer service is the occasional bad rep who doesn't seem to want to help you and makes things difficult for you. Once you get your RMA, you are golden. It is always quick and painless after you secure your RMA.   Most reps are really good too. Any horror story is just the person's unlucky experience. Motorola is usually one of the best there is in customer service."
MotoX,3dylnv,fugggggg,2,Mon Jul 20 20:54:36 2015 UTC,"Been having this problem with my 2013 for a few months, which has been annoying because I've reached my data limit twice now due to not being able to connect to WiFi (same thing applies to the Bluetooth option). I've had the phone for over a year so the warranty has ended, and when I called support they said it seems to be a hardware issue and that I'd have to pay $100 for a replacement. I dropped the phone once, but I have a hard time seeing how that might effect the antennas inside, and I'm fairly sure the problem persisted before I dropped it. Can't troubleshoot whether it's 4.4.4 causing the issue either since Verizon is taking forever to roll out 5.1, and a factory reset didn't solve anything which is why I ended up calling support.   So not really."
MotoX,3dylnv,koolaidistheshit,2,Mon Jul 20 21:52:53 2015 UTC,"Haven't had too.  I've had so many phones this year..  The OPO,  two G3s, a Note 4, two M7s, G2, Xperia z1c and z2   .. And I'll be damned if this isn't the best all arounder.  I impulse bought off amazon and as of last night I finally sold everything else.  I love this thing.  Every single part of it is excellent. Only beef is the 16gig storage but I got my whole music library on with 6 gb to spare so I'm happy. I'm very impressed by this phone,  I see myself using it for a long while unless the oneplus two turns out to be badass,  and even then this would be hard to give up."
MotoX,3dylnv,Ryr45,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:44:57 2015 UTC,They were quick to offer me a warranty replacement for screen burn in. I don't know if its worth it to take it though.
MotoX,3dylnv,mangeek,0,Tue Jul 21 16:27:26 2015 UTC,"Yes. I had a 2013 that I cracked. I did the Advance Exchange for the extra $25. They sent me a new phone (a 2013, thankfully those are still in stock) and a box to send the old one back. It took a few days for them to process the thing once it got back to them (they need to speed up their internal logistics), and I was billed appropriately.  Folks, use the Advanced Exchange, not the thing where you send your phone first. It's that simple and it's only $25 more. Heck, they should just raise their prices $25 and ONLY offer the advanced exchange, nobody without a phone is going to be happy about customer service, even if they had three day turnaround."

Download the xt1095 file from this website (i know it says 4.4.4 but it works with 5.0 and 5.1 too):  https://autoroot.chainfire.eu/  After just connect the phone in fastboot mode and double click at the bat file. The advantage of this method is that you don't overwrite your stock recovery, you are just rooted. In the future you can take OTAs by simply unrooting. If you want, you can flash twrp or cwm with root, it is easy."

MotoX,3dw71d,SX86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:14:19 2015 UTC,"The only way to go back to Kit Kat would be to use your carrier's appropriate SBF and flash it using RSD Lite. A factory reset only wipes the data (user data) and cache partition, not the system partition."

MotoX,3dw71d,SX86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:57:03 2015 UTC,I'm almost positive you would need an unlocked bootloader to do this.
MotoX,3dw71d,Timtim17,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:11:44 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the unlocked bootloader, since RSD Lite can use either FastBoot or their own protocol to push images.

This isn't an issue with Android or your Moto X, ATT did alter the update for their network before it got sent out to the public.  To be on the safe first back up any pictures or files you want to a computer, a cloud service like Google Drive, or Photos. Please note, that the Google Drive and Photos are opt-in services that you must check to make sure your pictures have synced.  The very last thing you can do, or rather ATT will do in-store, is factory reset the phone. This usually fixes everything and this is the first time ever that I had to factory reset the phone in the 6 yrs I've had android phones.  Edit: Missing words."
