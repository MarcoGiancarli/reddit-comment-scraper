So when a female congresswoman starts spewing misandry and talking about how all men should die, that is not sexist. Women can't be sexist, according to some (like the one in the post). Likewise, minorities can not be racist for the same reason. So when the black, mexican, or asian starts attacking a white person solely based on his race, it's acceptable and totally not racist.

menkampf,3871kw,Ultimate_Paragon,3,Tue Jun 2 19:38:00 2015 UTC,"Actually, he hated capitalism too.  It's just he needed support from the German business class, and they considered him the lesser of two evils.  In a nutshell: Hitler was simultaneously anti-communist, and anti-capitalist.  He openly and repeatedly slammed Marxist socialism and communism because he strongly believed in protecting private property and rejected class distinctions entirely.  At the same time, he strenuously rejected capitalism, stating repeatedly that it concentrated too much power into the hands of private citizens, and gave banks and international traders (and, according to him, Jewish people) too much influence over the operations of government.  In fact, there are plenty of records of him slamming capitalism itself as a ""Jewish creation"", while arguing that it needed to be destroyed.   That's why he invented ""National Socialism"".  He wanted to wed the fascist ideals of authoritarian nationalism with the borrowed socialist concept of the centralized planned economy.  His actual economic goal was to set up a nation that respected private property and private industry, while simultaneously placing it under strict centralized control to make sure that it operated for the benefit of the Reich.  Basically, you could make a profit, but only if Germany profited at the same time.  If you wanted to profit at the EXPENSE of the nation or people, you'd end up in front of a firing squad.   Hitler's proposed economic system was one of the reasons that he initially had so much appeal in Germany.  It attracted both hardline right-wingers, and soft middle-class leftists who wanted more government control over the economy but did not want to put their own wealth, jobs, or economic opportunities at risk.  Both Hitler and Mussolini marketed themselves to their peoples by promising them a ""third way"" that wasn't communism, and wasn't capitalism, but was a hybrid of the two."

menkampf,3215uh,samsonkeane,33,Thu Apr 9 19:15:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly... I'm not seeing the issue with the original article in this case. There's no ""all men are rapists"" shite, there's no overarching subtle or not-so-subtle misandry, it seems like a call to go back to what third-wave feminism should have been, trying to lessen the impact of harmful gender roles, trying to say ""women can be doctors, but they can also be housewives, that's their choice."" I actually completely agree with the screenshotted text. The other articles have the potential to be concerning, but this alone? I'm okay with this, entirely. I fully agree with it, even."
menkampf,3215uh,thejadefalcon,10,Thu Apr 9 21:51:01 2015 UTC,"Some of what he says is decent enough (in this part, not sure about the rest of the article, this part just read the funniest through the filter).  Like from elsewhere in the article:   There is a difference between individual struggles that some men face and the systematic sexism that all women encounter   This systematic oppression has yet to be shown. And with every new misinterpreted or misquoted statistic I feel less and less inclined to buy their dogma.   Toxic masculinity narrowly (and dangerously) defines “real men” as strong, violent, emotionless, sexually aggressive, and “wolf-like.”   Where are men taught to be emotionless? They are naturally less emotional than women as they have different hormones and different brains. This doesn't mean they never cry, and they aren't punished for doing so. Being overly emotional is unmanly because men aren't overly emotional.  Strength is either good or neutral. Violence can be good or evil or neither, and it is women who reward sexual aggressiveness, not the patriarchy.  It has always angered me a bit at how whenever feminists receive the criticism of    you say you're for equality but you're only for equality for women   they shoot back with something along the lines of   we want to change society to be more accepting of men being more emotional because men are suffering since they have to hide their emotions   even though this simply isn't one of the large issues men are facing. Women are projecting a certain bar of what ""healthy emotional outpouring"" looks like, and since most men don't reach that bar they assume men's problems stem from this. There is also a default, unspoken position that women could not possibly have any even partial responsibility for some of the issues men have today even though most men are raised and taught exclusively by women.   harmful gender roles   This gender role business is feminism essentially telling the world that a lot of women are making the ""wrong decision"" as if feminism gets to decide that. If a woman becomes a housewife or a nurse because she enjoys it, it is assumed now that this was because society pressured her against being in STEM. On what basis can we say that women are being pressured out of it? How do we know men aren't facing the exact same pressure but simply push through anyway because they are a different gender with a different brain? Why are so few feminists in STEM fields even though there are hundreds of programs across the country specifically with the goal of getting more women into STEM?"
menkampf,3215uh,devynci,2,Thu Apr 9 23:33:34 2015 UTC,"This systematic oppression has yet to be shown.   It might not be on the level of ""oh my god women are getting paid only 3/4 as much"", but women certainly are oppressed in many ways that men aren't. Why do most women fear for their safety late at night far more than men do? Why is catcalling so one-sided? Why are we constantly telling women that they should be unsatisfied with how they look unless they look like a model on the front page of a magazine? Far more than we do to men.   Where are men taught to be emotionless? They are naturally less emotional than women as they have different hormones and different brains. This doesn't mean they never cry, and they aren't punished for doing so. Being overly emotional is unmanly because men aren't overly emotional.   Can you show me evidence that men are inherently ""less emotional""? I'm very skeptical of that claim.  On the other hand, I can easily tell you where men are taught to be less emotional. When you were young, I'm sure you cried about stupid things all the time, right? Did your dad ever tell you to ""be a man and stop crying""? But I bet you if you had been a little girl doing the same thing, he would have hugged you and tried to make you feel better.  We tell young boys that ""men don't cry"" and ""men have to be strong"" etc. This is nurtured.   There is also a default, unspoken position that women could not possibly have any even partial responsibility for some of the issues men have today even though most men are raised and taught exclusively by women.   Actually, a lot of feminists do acknowledge that women perpetuate so-called patriarchy as well as misogyny. Women tell men to ""man up"" just as men do. Reasonable feminists don't blame men for the state of things. (The examples on this subreddit are often unreasonable -- but that doesn't mean all feminists are.)   If a woman becomes a housewife or a nurse because she enjoys it, it is assumed now that this was because society pressured her against being in STEM.   Absolutely not. A lot of feminists absolutely defend the right for women to be housewives or nurses; they just want them to have choices. And on the flip side, feminists generally want men to be able to have the option to be househusbands as well if they so choose, rather than feeling inadequate if they aren't the primary breadwinner.   How do we know men aren't facing the exact same pressure but simply push through anyway because they are a different gender with a different brain?   Again I think you're leaning way too much on the biological differences between the female and the male brain, and I think if you did some reading you'd realize that a lot of the ""differences"" are actually purely cultural, i.e. nurtured. They might have some basis in biology; certainly men and women have some different instincts, but I very much doubt it impacts what you says it does more than our societal expectations do.  Women have difficulties breaking into male-dominated fields just as men have difficulties breaking into female-dominated fields. In both cases, it's typically due to gender norms being taken to an extreme against them. I've heard of just as many male nurses facing discrimination and physical abuse as I have female programmers facing discrimination and sexual harassment.  Feminism isn't the problem -- social justice warriors are. Feel free to discuss this as much as you want with me."
menkampf,3215uh,metaltrite,3,Mon Apr 20 08:59:32 2015 UTC,"Why do most women fear for their safety late at night far more than men do?   Because they are not as physically powerful as men, and most people who assault strangers in the night are men.  However, in the US men make up 76.8% of murder victims while women make up the majority of rape victims. However, the rape victims are more often raped by people they know than random strangers in the night. Also, most murders in general in the US are gang-related.  So fear of strangers in general is somewhat irrational, but healthy in small doses and certain situations (like being in a high-crime neighborhood). This isn't oppression. Its crime. Women aren't victims ""more often"", the majority of victims varies by crime. The primary difference is that women have less of a physical advantage and thus are less able to protect themselves without some form of weapon. I imagine this girl, Miesha Tate isn't as concerned about being assaulted by strangers as the average woman. She has skills and training that hugely make up for her genetic disadvantage.   Can you show me evidence that men are inherently ""less emotional""?   https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200803/male-brain-vs-female-brain-i  https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200803/male-brain-vs-female-brain-ii-what-is-extreme-male-brain  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2919083/Male-female-brains-really-wired-differently-Study-finds-women-far-affected-emotional-images.html   Did your dad ever tell you to ""be a man and stop crying""?   No. When I cried, I cried. Nobody ever told me to stop or even told me it was unmanly. Once I hit puberty I didn't cry so much. It wasn't out of shame, I just very rarely had events occur that hit me hard enough to make me cry. Usually it required a huge life change or a huge loss.  Thinking back, I wish there had been more demands on me to man up sooner, and faster. I am playing catch-up now, because I became quite effeminate in many ways during junior high and high school, and my cowardice and mental weakness wreaked havoc on my future and my abilities. I still have anxiety issues because my avoidance of scary things was always rewarded, so they remained scary even if they shouldn't be.   Why is catcalling so one-sided?   Because men and women have completely different (but complementary) sexual dynamics. Women are more risk averse, and women want good men. Good men are not the men who hide in the back and wait for women to approach them. Women want men, men are strong and courageous and they do the approaching. This is the biological system, and it exists in many other species. Men approach women in hopes of winning her desire. A woman makes herself as attractive as possible to maximize the value (physical attractiveness, social status, etc) of the men approaching her. She rejects those men who she doesn't feel attraction to, and accepts the men whom she does.  This entire dynamic is why catcalling is something men do. Catcalling is just a bad attempt at that initial move with a beautiful woman.  But I should add that what feminists define as ""catcalling"" is absurd. That famous video of that girl walking through the city included people saying stuff like ""hey beautiful"" or ""good morning."" I'm sorry, but if feminists feel the need to scream about how awful it is that some people have the nerve to be nice to you and say hi, it really screams entitlement.  If most men who are rewarded with sex are the men who approach, then most men are going to be incentivised to approach. Incentivizing something and then denouncing everything that isn't perfectly to your liking is painfully narcissistic.  Its also very narcissistic to be ok with men initiating contact when they are ""acceptable"" but calling it harassment when they are not. Women want men to approach, but if they aren't worthy then they shouldn't even be allowed to try. A girl puts on the makeup and wears the skinny jeans and looks as sexy as possible to get the attention of the high status men, and then feels repulsed when low status men verbalize their attraction to her, to the point that she considers it a societal problem.  Also, if you want to see the closest thing you'll get to female catcalling, go watch any boy band member or other famous male as he walks by his adoring fans. There is a lot of sexual desire in that adoration. Notice that there isn't really an equivalent to this for men, there aren't any female stars who find themselves surrounded by hordes of men screaming ""I love you!"" or ""Kiss me!"" or whatever. (Or, to reference the video linked above, hordes of men following some girl who they don't even know but is perceived to be famous). Men do not feel sexual desire as a result of somebody's fame. Its different, because the genders are different.   Why are we constantly telling women that they should be unsatisfied with how they look unless they look like a model on the front page of a magazine?   Who buys fashion magazines? Straight men? Women read those magazines. Men don't. Look at one of those car magazines, or just look at porn; that is where you will see the bodies that straight men desire.  The models placed in fashion magazines are models chosen by higher-ups in the modeling industry. Who are the higher ups in the modeling industry? Women and gay men. Look at the faces of those models. Square jaw, thin, bony body. They often tie the hair in such a way to tighten up the face even more. They are finding women who look like 16-18 year old boys. This has nothing to do with men or a patriarchy.  Also, while I agree those magazines are awful, I haven't seen where they inform women they should be unsatsified. What they seem to provide are solutions to a preexisting dissatisfaction: ""Lose 5 lbs in two weeks"", ""latest trends in makeup, 2015"", etc. The advice is annoying bullshit (especially their ""tips from guys"" which are usually frighteningly bad).   Far more than we do to men   Only because men don't benefit very much from makeup, because a beautiful masculine face is not about youth but about strength and fitness.  The amount of steroid abuse in Hollywood and in modeling should tell you a little bit about the pressures on men. However, men's beauty does not rely as much on their physical appearence as it does for women, however it is still somewhat important. The men who have spread their genes on to the next generation for tens of thousands of years were not just pretty, they were useful. Look at the male body, look at the female body. The female body is more reproduction/nurturing focused, the male body is more resource gathering/fighting focused. This pattern is exactly the same in terms of what elements of a person bring about sexual arousal in each gender.  Also, hot women are not fat. Hot men are not fat. I guess I don't have a problem with that, and its not exclusive to either gender. To be a ""hot man"" as seen in magazines and films, it takes a shit ton more work and sacrifice than to be a hot woman as seen in magazines and films. Its a lot more struggle to look like this then to look like this. I'm not complaining, I just find it laughable when women talk about impossible beauty standards while I'm going to the gym 9 hours a week and weighing my meals.   I think if you did some reading you'd realize that a lot of the ""differences"" are actually purely cultural, i.e. nurtured   https://vimeo.com/19889788  Also, if this is true, why are the ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" traits all alike across cultures, including ones that had never contacted each other?   Feminism isn't the problem   Here is my problem with this: I am judging feminism by what feminists do, everybody I talk about feminism with judges them by the definition repeated over and over by feminists, and then just says any person I bring up ""isn't a real feminist."" A group should be judged by the actions of its members, not its slogans. (There are multiple links in that last sentence, FYI)  Most feminists are social justice warriors, so I guess I don't really feel like the two can be so easily seperated.  If you think feminism is not the issue, please tell me which influencial feminists (who represent what you define as ""real feminism"") are actually part of the feminist movement and are not social justice warriors. And please don't say Christina Hoff Sommers, because feminists don't listen to her, in fact they hate her"

Edit: New Link, new also available for Chrome.  Download link to my Firefox and Chrome Extension  It will occasionally miss words or produce nonsense but if it works it tends to be hilarious and revealing. I intend to update it and expand the wordfilter over time to make it much better.   Also quite fun is to use the default setting (swapping the genders) and browsing threads on AskMen or AskWoman about Sex. A thread about how to give a blowjob for example will become a Thread about how to give cunnilingus (But maybe I just have a very childish humor )"

This myth was reported by Snorri Sturluson (Skáldskaparmál 5) (1).

Note that this isn't just ""a few radicals"", but there is enough action against male equality to prevent change, or to incite change in the wrong direction, and there is little to no action from feminists in favour of male equality.

This little speech casts 'trans people' as the magical girl protagonists, and 'truscum', which AFAIK means 'people who actually have dysphoria' as the Witch monsters.  This little analogy falls apart completely, because what she is saying here is 'trans people need to kill 'truscum' in order to not become them themselves', since most of the angst in the series comes from the protagonists being doomed to a live of endless battle from which the only escapes are death or becoming a monster.

While from innate cowardice the upper classes turn away from a PoC womyn whom the media attacks with lies and slander, the broad masses from stupidity or simplicity believe everything. The state authorities either cloak themselves in silence or, what usually happens, in order to put an end to the press campaign, they persecute the unjustly attacked, which, in the eyes of such an official ass, passes as the preservation of state authority and the safeguarding of law and order.

Alternatively, men who are raped are often mocked or looked upon with suspicion (e.g. ""how could that woman possibly rape a strong guy like you?)  Men are called perverts for sleeping around too much. It's basically the same thing.  Anyone can get murdered for saying no. You want to tell the guy holding a knife to your throat that you aren't giving him your wallet? I think he'll cut whether you're a woman or not.  Well, uh... Okay? I guess there are men who can do that. Probably some women too, though.  Treated like crap? Well, yeah. Plenty of men get abused because ""they can take it"", being tougher and stronger and all.

While revoking person's basic human rights is deeply problematic, the tumblrites in question are proposing doing that not based on someone's sexuality/gender/ethnicity, but on someone's actions - and actions which I think everyone can agree are definitely attrocious.

However, the Nazi regime is far older than the tests that demonstrated that the Beta Israel are not ethnically Jewish, and their Rabbis have always claimed (despite the genetic evidence) that they are descended from the Tribe of Dan, so the Nazis would have treated the Beta Israel as they did other Jews. I have no idea how SJWs would treat them.  Very few Kaifeng Jews still practice Judaism, but they are ethnically Jewish, so I assume Hitler would have treated them like he did other Jews. I have no idea how SJWs would treat them.  Yemeni Jews are Mizrahi. I asked this question because I have no idea how SJWs would have treated them.

menkampf,2u39et,F-J-W,9,Fri Jan 30 15:33:01 2015 UTC,"Actually it is still used in certain context in German. For instance in a documentary, you could totally hear something like this:  „Hier sehen wir das Tier in seinem natürlichen Lebensraum.“  (“Here we see the animal it's natural habitat.”)  It should be noted that quite a few words that are strongly associated with the Nazis by non-Germans, are totally common German words at least in some contexts. Even „Führer“ just means leader or guide. It is totally appropriate to refer to a travel-guide with this word (both the human and the printed kind)."

It's a kink, not some dastardly act that men commit. What? If my girlfriend wants to be tied up I'm suddenly a terrible person? What if I want to be the submissive/masochist, am I still being evil in her eyes? It's mutual enjoyment.

menkampf,2u4kiu,Riock,9,Thu Feb 12 23:11:49 2015 UTC,"While I appreciate why you replaced Amazonian with Übermensch, I kind of hate that you did it because Nietzsche -- whose philosophy is radically anti-fascist and anarchistic -- has been unfairly associated with Nazism and I hate seeing that association reinforced.  Nietzsche suffered a mental breakdown late in his life and his sister gained control of his publishing rights.  Her husband was a radical antisemitic proto-fascist, and the pair of them produced heavily edited versions of some of Nietzsche's work, manipulating the anti-Christian elements of his philosophy into an ""anti-jew"" message and completely distorting his writings about blood and volk -- in the unedited texts, Nietzsche goes on at great length about how every race on Earth has achieved only part of the full greatness of human potential, and the Übermensch will only arise when all races have co-mingled their blood -- in other words, the Übermensch would be the ultimate mutt, a mix of every race/ethnicity.  And, like many of his ideas, he wasn't being literal.  He meant that the Übermensch would need to learn and understand from every perspective, every culture.    He specifically and unequivocally argued that the German ""spirit"" (zeitgeist is a word invented after Nietzsche died, but its what he meant) was inherently weak and flawed, and was made stronger by the participation of Jews in German society.  There is absolutely no way in hell that the Nazi party or fascist politics could ever produce the Übermensch.  ...  Sorry...I just care about Nietzsche a lot.  Total Nietzsche fanboy, right here."

menkampf,2twunn,lazylax,2,Wed Jan 28 01:38:04 2015 UTC,"That link just leads back to your original post, I'm just wondering what it actually said"
menkampf,2twunn,lazylax,3,Wed Jan 28 02:50:18 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry, let me fix it.  Edit: Fixed the link."
menkampf,2twunn,lazylax,2,Wed Jan 28 02:51:33 2015 UTC,Thanks Vargas

menkampf,2ttyuf,Smogshaik,16,Wed Jan 28 07:16:51 2015 UTC,This is actually fascinating!
menkampf,2ttyuf,RRuS,44,Wed Feb 18 11:38:19 2015 UTC,WHAT IS PROCREATION
menkampf,2ttyuf,letsgocrazy,11,Tue Jan 27 12:38:19 2015 UTC,This is actually disgusting how well this works when switching out the words.
menkampf,2ttyuf,dinklebob,10,Wed Jan 28 15:20:11 2015 UTC,Ahahaha I never thought I'd see Luna taken seriously. Lunalaluda is an SJW troll.
menkampf,2ttyuf,letsgocrazy,17,Thu Feb 12 04:01:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's much point in picking these obviously insane ones out, because using analogy to contrast views doesn't exactly achieve anything."
menkampf,2ttyuf,dan7315,27,Tue Jan 27 17:58:19 2015 UTC,"I'm semi-sure the original is satire, but honestly there's no way of telling anymore."
menkampf,2ttyuf,letsgocrazy,22,Tue Jan 27 20:20:49 2015 UTC,Poe's Law all the way.

menkampf,2ttyuf,ColdFire86,-18,Tue Jan 27 22:16:24 2015 UTC,"If you want to use a ridiculous semantic argument as an alternative to using your judgement, then it's no wonder why you can't tell the difference between satire or reality."
menkampf,2ttyuf,leftovercakepiece,20,Tue Jan 27 22:59:55 2015 UTC,There's people out there who genuinely believe this shite and they speak just like this. It is hard to tell what's satire and what isn't.
menkampf,2tsv4x,gztichy,9,Tue Jan 27 03:35:19 2015 UTC,This whole subreddit is a brilliant idea.  Well done.
menkampf,2tsv4x,GhotiStyx,4,Tue Jan 27 05:17:58 2015 UTC,I feel blessed to be both a man and a Jew who can't grow a beard to save my life. All I get is some wispy goatee rapist-looking growth on my face.
