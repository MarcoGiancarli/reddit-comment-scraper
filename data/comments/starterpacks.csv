It's definitely Midwest but it's certainly not North and culturally and location wise it may also be considered a Southern state.

Now that I'm old I don't give a fuck what I'm listening to, so long as it's good.  The music I thought was the best shit in the world makes me cringe now when I listen to it again, and stuff that I'd written off as ""poseur shit"" back then has become more enjoyable to me than any of the random, ""find the most obscure, nonsensical grunge band you can stomach and wear it like a flag"" bullshit I was listening to back then.

starterpacks,3dkoyl,thehappycloud,5,Sun Jul 19 21:25:00 2015 UTC,"If I had a hat, that comment would have blown it right off! Mechanical keyboards look vintage?? Maybe some custom ones do, but that's because the owner customized it that way. Commercial mechs now days have pretty much set the standard for what keyboards are concerned, both in quality and design. Have a look around."
starterpacks,3dkoyl,DestroyerOfWombs,4,Sat Jul 18 23:25:18 2015 UTC,"You're thinking of Model Ms. A mechanical keyboard is a keyboard, ANY keyboard, with a mechanical switch."
starterpacks,3dkoyl,Swag-Rambo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:21:18 2015 UTC,"They make so much noise and they're so vintage looking, in a bad way.   If you mean a model M then, sure you could see it that way. But a new keyboard can look like anything, a normal keyboard, a 'gaming' keyboard, a 'stealth' keyboard etc etc.  As for the noise, that is purely down to the switch choice (and to a point your typing). Many are no louder a membrane board."

starterpacks,3dkoyl,Swag-Rambo,2,Sun Jul 19 01:14:37 2015 UTC,"I'm new here, why is it so hated? I have the Corsair k70 rgb, is it hated as well?"
starterpacks,3dkoyl,Swag-Rambo,2,Sun Jul 19 14:24:06 2015 UTC,"The people of /r/MechanicalKeyboards really don't like the mainstream keyboards. I'll give the haters that. There's nothing terribly wrong with the Corsair Keyboards. They're solidly built, nice features, good quality control. The difference is you can't make it yours like you can with other keyboards. You build an Ergodox or some 60% keyboard, that's your keyboard. You built it. You can change the layout. The keycaps don't come preinstalled. I'll compare mechanical keyboards to computers. A Rubber dome keyboard is your basic Dell or HP computer, with onboard graphics and nothing special. A Corsair keyboard is your baseline gaming/high performance computer, something like an Dell XPS or HP Envy. A Ducky, Filco, Leopold, ect. is closer to a custom built computer. You have a wider selection of features, along with higher build quality. Razer is along the lines of Alienware. Something that feels fine, but is overpriced."
starterpacks,3dkoyl,Swag-Rambo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:20:36 2015 UTC,I completely understand the reasoning behind making your own mechanical keyboard vs buying a premade one. How do I get into this? Are there tutorials? What are the prices like?
starterpacks,3dkoyl,pooish,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:17:52 2015 UTC,"Well someone priced theirs out at $500, an ergodox is less than that. Plenty of tutorials on mechanicalkeyboards, just search um up"
starterpacks,3dkoyl,NikolaiBorjeski,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:43:28 2015 UTC,I posted in another reply why people in r/mk don't like Razer. They sell Corsair keyboards at Best Buy.
starterpacks,3dkoyl,pooish,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:42:20 2015 UTC,"Most members of mechanicalkeyboards that dislike razer dislike them because of bad experiences. They manufacture their keyboards in sub par factories, usually Chinese. Their quality control is not as good as other companies. The company that makes their switches has poor quality control compared to Cherry or Omron. I owned a Razer Lycosa, but as soon as the warranty was up, the media keys started to activate themselves. Usually the volume would act like vol down was being continually pressed, or play/pause would. I had a Razer Deathadder, same thing happened. Warranty was up, so it started malfunctioning."

Watch the TED talk: Read more, listen to people who have already done what you want to do, and be more social.  Don't let your own confirmation bias keep you from hearing good advice. If you don't like the guy, that's fine, but the whole purpose of the TED talk was to bring definition to the route to success that he took."
starterpacks,3czwas,Debusatie,26,Sun Jul 12 16:08:45 2015 UTC,I watched his ted talk and his 2 hour commercial video for his $100 book or whatever. The entire video used EVERY sales tactic you can think of and did it without shame. It's so obviously a ploy that it almost works.
starterpacks,3czwas,lyspr,-26,Sun Jul 12 16:10:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah you watched a fucking commercial, idiot. I watched a talk meant to educate. If Tai himself asked me to buy something, I'd tell him to go fuck himself.  I'm talking about JUST the Ted talk. I like the Ad on youtube because I think it grabs peoples attention, but I've got the wisdom to not be sold something and not be tricked into watching a feature-film length commercial.  On top of that, I was a salesman for a few years, in fact up until recently I was making my money exclusively through being a salesman and I can tell you that it takes a choice to be sold something. A person doesn't get suckered into any sale, no matter how good the salesperson is. Billy Mays himself couldn't make you buy something.   In conclusion, maybe it's shitty to sell things to desperate people, but it's not any less shitty than casinos that peddle their deals to the mailman and empty his pocket at the table. Customers are customers because they made the decision to buy."

starterpacks,3cu070,fast_at_last,55,Fri Jul 10 20:36:41 2015 UTC,I think it has to do with 2 things.   1) They come from a rigid environment where questions aren't really asked nor are they welcome. Do as you are told and don't ask why environment.  2) They probably werent the greatest students coming out of High School and went into the military. Now maturing a bit and having 4-5 years of life experience in the military they understand the need to understand subject matter and aren't afraid to admit they don't understand something. In school I find people don't bother to ask questions when clearly everyone is having a hard time understanding a topic.  Just a few opinions since I saw a few of these during my time in undergrad and masters.
starterpacks,3cu070,SC2GIF,23,Fri Jul 10 21:09:56 2015 UTC,"You are pretty close to being right. At least in my expereience. I was an awful student in high school, graduated Magna cum Laude from college. The thing about my time in the Navy that made me more comfortable asking questions was when I flooded a compartment on my ship because I wasn't sure how to do something and didn't ask for clarification. Being dressed down by  the chief's mess is a quick way to get comfortable with asking questions. Do as you're told, yes, but you sure as fuck better know what the fuck it is you are supposed to do and do it the right fucking way the first fucking time."

Like others have said, I don't care about being wrong or looking dumb in front of other students.  A lot of the other kids in my class are self conscious and shy and intimidated by speaking up in front of the class.  Part of it is that I am older than a lot of my peers and part of is is that the military helps to instill a lot of confidence in people. At least for me, I think I take my education a lot more seriously than many of my peers.  I had to work really hard to get to school and I have seen what not having an education in the workplace can look like... and it kind of sucks.  I am there to learn so I stay engaged in the material and if no one else has the answer to the question... I do! This one maybe doesn't have to do with the military so much, but I am made really uncomfortable by long silences and frustrated instructors.  There is no sense in them thinking that NO ONE in class did the reading or can critically think about the material.   This maybe looks like I am being really self-congratulating (and maybe it is) but I just have a little different perspective on my education that some of my peers who came straight from high school.  TL;DR Pretty much what everyone else said.  edit: after 3 years on reddit I still suck a formatting!"

A lot of the packs and glasses those vets wear is stuff they may have been issued or purchased on their own while in the service.

Theres is an important reason to do this: neural and physiological development at the earlier stages is super fast and supper important.

All they end up doing is driving aggressively and making parking lots a nightmare.  While Ed Hardy and Affliction have no purpose aside from being douchebag uniform, apparently."

No she is not running it like Hitler. You can say she has a fascist attitude in that she silences people that disagree, but ultimately her goal is profit, to milk reddit.  Perhaps yeah its a fascist attitude, but this whole ""Literally Hitler"" is stupid, because you know everybody does it. You hate on Pao and give her Nazis attire, Conservatives hate on Obama and give him nazi attire. The joke is damn old and unoriginal and its not even effective because everyone uses it on their enemies No I don't think its pointless to complain about her because she is handling reddit like shit, but it is point to just upload a hundred nazi images once something happens."

She has a totalitarian attitude running things but that has not necessarilly something to do with nazis. (Literally used as hyperbole not as saying something is so similar to another thing) Another fitting hyperbole is... she is literally Stalin... or Chairman Pao (Mao) or whatever.  The blunt Nazi comparison is in my opinion the laziest and most often used form of slandering you enemies... of course it has it reasons, but that makes it not any less lazy."

starterpacks,3azbqx,Brobi_WanKenobi,7,Wed Jun 24 22:19:27 2015 UTC,"Did a bit more research. Looks like they voted on it in 1995, but officially ratified it in 2013.  http://www.cbsnews.com/news/after-148-years-mississippi-finally-ratifies-13th-amendment-which-banned-slavery/  http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/02/mississippi-officially-abolishes-slavery-ratifies-13th-amendment/  As a filthy monarchist. Could you fill me in on how the constitution of the glorious republic of the USA works?  Could any of the states de-ratify an amendment if it really wanted to? Like, say, the 2nd and 4th that you guys love so much? Or maybe inmplement (actual) Martial Law and de-ratify the 5th?"
starterpacks,3azbqx,ThrowCarp,5,Thu Jun 25 08:56:31 2015 UTC,"So here in the US big legal stuff on a national level is left up to popular sovereignty. When an amendment to the Constitution is proposed it needs to be ratified by 3/4 of the states. Then it becomes the law of the land, no matter what. So even if 75% of the states accepted the admendment at the time, it doesn't matter what those other 25% say, it's passed and will be enforced in all the states. After that the other states generally ratify it as a formality to show solidarity. Many people will say that the Civil War started because the federal government was exercising too much power and the states had too little say in major changes."
starterpacks,3azbqx,Brobi_WanKenobi,2,Thu Jun 25 11:41:14 2015 UTC,So the 13th amendment was ratified by 75% of USA states not including the CSA states? What happened?
starterpacks,3azbqx,Doppleganger07,3,Thu Jun 25 12:55:39 2015 UTC,"Lincoln died right before the 13th Amendment went up to Congress to vote. Andrew Johnson, his VP, took over as president and oversaw the vote. Andrew Johnson was a pretty shit president, but he has the Union victory on his side so the public is generally favorable toward him at this point. Basically he told the Confederate states that the Union will accept them back into the USA, however as a requirement they are required to ratify the amendment. Of course this goes against the whole idea of popular sovereignty; Johnson is pretty much holding the nation hostage with this ultimatum.   So with most of the states staying true to that requirement, of course the bill got its 75% vote to pass and now all states were readmitted back into the union with no slavery. There were several states (Florida, Oregon, New Jersey, Kentucky, a few more) which rejected it, but to no avail."

The only reason those other times didn't effect South Carolina was because they weren't here. Of course a racially motivated attack on black South Carolinians is going to call into question the merits of flying a flag that represents racial hatred towards blacks, and was put up purely as a protest to the civil rights movement.

Flag shows hatred for blacks? How? Because the south had slaves? 85% of the people in the south never owned a slave. Slavery was a terrible thing. But slaves weren't brought here on ships flying the southern cross. They had the U.S. Flag. For 89 years the United States, primarily the New England states brought in more slaves than any where else in the world, under the flag of the U.S.  So how does old glory not show racism?

starterpacks,3azbqx,Lostnole84,6,Thu Jun 25 01:00:19 2015 UTC,"My logic is this... the confederate flag flying in columbia right now was placed there in I believe 1962. South Carolina flew that flag there for one reason. As a sign of protest towards the civil rights movement. Additionally, that flag is not the ""Confederate flag"", nor the South Carolina confederate flag. It's a battle flag that was flown almost primarily as a Tenn Battle flag. That particular flag's popularity took off when the KKK started using it as a sign for hatred and racism.  People who act like that flag has historical relevance have zero understanding of what the flag's origins are. Once you understand those origins I don't understand how one couldn't understand the issue with that flag.   So yes, that flag absolutely shows hatred for blacks.

Even if this were true, which we deny, slavery is not all our enemies are fighting for. It is merely the pretense to establish sectional superiority and a more centralized form of government, and to deprive us of our rights and liberties.” -Maj. General Patrick R. Cleburne, CSA, January 1864  The secession was about state's rights. But as you know the south did not win the war, so it can be turned any way you'd like. Are you from the south of you just generalizing on how you think we are?  Do you think that people in the north did not own slaves? 85% of the people in the south did not own slaves. As I have stated 5 times I don't care if they move the flag, but comparing a nazi germany to the south is just a piss poor attempt.

starterpacks,3azdwg,deHavillandDash8Q400,-33,Wed Jun 24 23:00:18 2015 UTC,"Well, it's an adjective, for one, not a noun. It's supposed to modify a noun. Female penguin. Female student. Female human being. Not just ""female"". I think it makes a guy sound unintelligent and woman-hatey, personally. I know women say it too. Women say a lot of things. ""Females,"" ""chicks,"" ""I'm not like other girls,"" ""keep calm and Chive on,"" etc. Just because some girl says something too doesn't mean it won't make a guy sound like a mouth breather."
starterpacks,3azdwg,deHavillandDash8Q400,20,Wed Jun 24 23:18:46 2015 UTC,https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=female%20definition  Google says it's an adjective and a noun.  I think it's kind of funny how everything that you say is wrong with it is that it's not a noun and by using it as such it shows that you're unintelligent when you're the one who fails to recognize one of the definitions and insists that it's actually wrong when you're wrong.

The only people in real life I've seen argue the right to call women ""females"" have all been variations on that guy.

starterpacks,3aejpz,-42O,6,Fri Jun 19 23:19:49 2015 UTC,"Yup keep your chest and head up. Back doesn't move, keep it braced. Let your legs do all the work.   ProTip: Learn perfect form before adding heavier weight, or learn the hard way. Watching YT videos helped me tremendously after I learned the hard way. Posting on /r/powerlifting has helped me too.  ProTip2: Deadlifts and squats complement each other. DLs make squats go up and vice versa. Then you'll have an evenly shaped leg, rather than giant quads and tiny hammies."

starterpacks,39iu7v,gtr0y,-15,Fri Jun 12 16:51:08 2015 UTC,Well it's not smoking in the same way non-alcogolic beer is not drinking. In my experience all the smokers I know who have tried vaping have gone back to cigarettes. I think the best way to not get cancer is to just stop smoking and vaping all-together.
starterpacks,39iu7v,PetraB,9,Fri Jun 12 12:30:43 2015 UTC,"I fail to see the your point with the beer, to be honest. Non-alcoholic beer contains no alcohol, so you are not drinking alcohol. Vaping does not involve combustion, so you are not smoking. I've been smoke free for 3 years now, couldn't be happier."
starterpacks,39iu7v,Shippu7,-5,Fri Jun 12 12:42:37 2015 UTC,"Most ""non-alcoholic"" beer has an alcohol content of .5 ABV whereas a regular beer has about 5 ABV. The point is your still getting the thing that is keeping you addicted."
starterpacks,39iu7v,PetraB,8,Fri Jun 12 12:49:42 2015 UTC,Studies have shown that nicotine when not used in conjunction with maoi inhibitors found in cigarettes is far less addictive. The harm and addiction rate is about the same as caffeine.  Everyone I know is a caffeine addict but nobody gives them guff or alludes to  caffeine being low strength cocaine .
starterpacks,39iu7v,Dr0gar,5,Fri Jun 12 13:08:49 2015 UTC,"The problem with smoking isn't nicotine, which also happens to have very little to do with the smoker's addiction, which is mostly psychological. Kefir can contain up to 2% alcohol, yet drinking it does not make you an alcoholic. Long story short, vaping is reducing damage to people who are otherwise unable to quit smoking."
starterpacks,39iu7v,agentdax5,-4,Fri Jun 12 13:14:16 2015 UTC,Yeah seriously. A lot the folks that do it are kinda douchy about it. Most of us just wanted off cigarettes. I can breathe now & I smell like a bag of skittles to boot!

You would think they had just escaped from Auschwitz the way they go on, but once you block the subverses like /v/meanwhileonreddit the site is actually fairly good.

Diagnosed by psychiatrists as suffering from a borderline personality disorder,     Dahmer was found to be legally sane at his trial. Convicted of fifteen of the sixteen murders he had committed in Wisconsin, Dahmer was sentenced to fifteen terms of life imprisonment on February 15, 1992.  He was later sentenced to a sixteenth term of life imprisonment for an additional homicide committed in Ohio in 1978.  On November 28, 1994, Dahmer was beaten to death in prison by Christopher Scarver, a fellow inmate at the Columbia Correctional Institution.

This isn't exactly the fastest moving subreddit.  You have every right to be upset about it indeed. By all means yell, kick, scream, cry because a site that you used for free no longer lets you complain about fat people, and just like you are allowed to whine about censorship I have every right to make fun of you about it. But do me a favor: Go into work on Monday morning (assuming you work and you're not another high school kid home for the summer with two much time on his hands) and call your supervisor a hamplanet. See how long you last there. Then you'll see why everyone else who aren't the FPH-SRC-KIA-CoonTown-whatever network of whiny reactionary subs think you all are a joke and just biding our time until you finally fuck off to Voat permanently and quit dragging this site down."
starterpacks,39csqt,OrangeAdventure,0,Thu Jun 11 18:04:26 2015 UTC,"Why dont you take a minute to actually read my previous comments and educate yourself. This isnt about wanting to make fun of fat people. This is about a new set of rules being put in place that gives the admins reason to shut down subreddits based on opinions. You wanna talk about people dragging this site down? Look at your own self for that. The kind of people who just accept everything at face value like yourself are the ones who will be the downfall of this place. You want to just willingly go along with whatever bullshit is put into place so you can look at cat pictures and tired ass memes. Some of us actually consider this a great place for information and learning and open minded discussion but if that is being taken away then of course there is going to be backlash. Seriously, if you are the kind of person that is going to be fighting for these new rules to be put into place then you go right on ahead.

A lot of economic theorists don't place value into the metrics of non-economic factors that benefit from the short- and medium-term benefits. Increased minimum wage brings with it increased prosperity, which isn't just ""how much I have,"" but also ""how much am I willing to spend."" It stimulates economic growth by making more of the general populace able to spend their money on a greater range of things. Part of prosperity is also consumer mood - a happy consumer is more willing to spend their extra pennies than a neutral or miserable consumer is. Again, this greatly influences economic growth."

The USA is in a seven year malaise with no sign of improvement. Unemployment -- true unemployment (include all of working age) -- is at its highest levels since the 1970's.   Raising the minimum wage isn't going to be a good thing. It hurts small businesses disproportionately. It would tank the economy.    (Small business is the sparkplug of the economy.

The tools for pulling a nation out of recession have traditionally been to invest in labor capital and increase regulation on misbehaving markets. This worked for us after the Great Depression and it can work again.  Furthermore, here's a nifty link on how raising the minimum wage is actually a lot better for business, especially small ones, than your statements imply Particularly of note is how a higher minimum wage gives small businesses better employee retention and satisfaction, meaning less money wasted on training a revolving door of recruits.   It all comes down to this: if a job is worthwhile enough to have someone do it, it's worthwhile to pay them appropriately for their time. A minimum wage law simply states that an hour of a human being's life should be worth a bare minimum as a commodity, and that the value should be sufficient for that person to live, eat, and be healthy, assuming they work a full workweek like everyone else."
starterpacks,393ibg,Aconator,2,Wed Jun 10 18:21:16 2015 UTC,"I agree partially. What we need is more regulation right now, not less.

I do think* we need better tax allocation and balancing, which means less taxes for some, and more taxes for others. As per slimming government, I also partially agree - we need significantly less spending on military, and slightly more on other aspects - specifically, education and science initiatives.  As per the Obamacare comment - it's only hurting small businesses because of the changes that were made to it by congress. The original concept that was proposed was an extra tax, paid by workers, that would fund a national healthcare initiative - it would have been a non-issue. It was only after Congress got their teeth into it that it turned into the business-hurting vampire it is currently."
starterpacks,393ibg,FM4k,-5,Wed Jun 10 22:03:17 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with your assessment of what caused this. The reason there was such a real estate bubble is because in the late 90's, the US government changed the rules on lending essentially forcing banks to severely loosen their credit standards. Banks were almost afraid to turn anyone down for fear of a discrimination lawsuit. So in my book, it was THE REGULATORS who caused the crisis.   As for larger government, again, I disagree. No one is less efficient than government. Show me what they do well? I want LESS government and more private sector. That will get us better returns on our limited capital and grow wealth (which even JFK realized ""raises all boats"").   As for Obamacare, who cares why it's the way it is? It is...and it shouldn't be.   That said, when was it proposed as a tax? They went out of their way to write a law that was not a tax. Which made it unconstitutional because while Congress MAY levy a tax, they cannot force us to buy anything. So after they went out of their way to keep from calling this a tax, the Supreme Court exhibited conniptions to say yes, it was a tax and therefore legal. Absolutely Kafkaesque.   And no...what they've done bears no resemblance to creating a fund to help pay for those who can't. A fund would have made sense. Make changes for the few who need but aren't receiving healthcare. (Note that being uninsured does not mean you don't get healthcare, but that's another story.) But instead of some fund and exception based program, Obamacare is a complete top to bottom reconfiguration of the US healthcare system. Essentially, healthcare is being assimilated by the government. It isn't there yet, but over time, it will be 100% government controlled. (As mentioned earlier, government does nothing well.)   As for tax allocation, absolutely, I believe everyone should have to pay some tax.  Everyone. I do believe the wealthy should be asked to pay a BIT more (not a lot more). But I also believe no one should be exempt. Skin in the game might wake some folks up.   A brief word on education. We already spend more per student than 80% of the developed world but achieve abysmal results. The answer is NOT more spending. The answer is start from scratch. Use modern technology. Rebuild the model. I believe we could spend a third of the money and double the result -- but we'd have to tear down the concept of classrooms and massive bureaucracies.   As for military spending? Like all government activities, there is waste -- most of which I would attribute to lobbyists. That said, China is becoming a regional bully, expanding its territorial waters and airspace, building militarized islands, threatening Taiwan, Honk Kong, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam -- to name a few. Russia is threatening Ukraine and who next? Venezuela is stealing territory from Guyana and other neighbors. And then, there's ISIS. Should we really be cutting back on our navy and air force?    Final thing I'll say? I am always accused of not caring about the poor. Just the opposite. I love everyone. I want everyone to achieve self actualization -- be the best they can be.  But if you're caught up in a web of government handouts, you cannot possibly have high self-esteem. We're creating generational poverty. Raising the minimum wage will not help that.   I love what Franklin said. Paraphrased: ""The best thing you can do for a poor person is make then uncomfortable in their poverty.""   That doesn't mean punish them. It means, leave them with the means and motivation to get up and get going."

So you're discounting the scores of memos, messages, and emails where high-ranking members of the banking industry were very literally discussing their actions and what consequences they would have, and how they wouldn't have to worry because they effectively owned anybody who would prosecute them? Like, even a minor google search will bring up a lot of documents that had been recovered from banking members.   As for Obamacare, who cares why it's the way it is? It is...and it shouldn't be. That said, when was it proposed as a tax?   Like I said - the first inception. A lot of people in Congress were furious about having it exist as a tax, since that meant they couldn't opt-out of it. I'm not even kidding. It's crazy.   As for tax allocation, absolutely, I believe everyone should have to pay some tax. Everyone. I do believe the wealthy should be asked to pay a BIT more (not a lot more). But I also believe no one should be exempt. Skin in the game might wake some folks up.   I'm glad we agree on something!   We already spend more per student than 80% of the developed world but achieve abysmal results   Sort of. So, it's difficult to get metrics on how much is actually spent on students. Remember, schools will often spend extra budget on additions or refinishing their buildings, or even unscrupulous things - some staff members of some school districts intentionally pad the salaries of their friends. Nepotism is a real thing, and it's pretty prevalent in the current US school system.   As for military spending? Like all government activities, there is waste   This is true - there is waste, but with military defense spending, there's unprecedented waste. Only last year, the government had 2 trillion dollars it couldn't account for, even after including ""black budgets."" Most countries on earth don't have a GDP of what we lost in the last few years due to waste. It's staggering.  While I agree that countries like China, Russia, North Korea, Iraq, Syria, and many others deserve our full attention and all the things that come with it, there's definitely room for improvement. If we had not lost 2 trillion dollars, think of where we could be now instead of where we currently are.  Finally...   We're creating generational poverty.   It's not just the financial system that causes poverty. Remember: We live in a country where Healthcare is costs an arbitrarily high amount, and where we have for-profit prisons, where we have a ""war on drugs,"" despite having the CIA help establish South American drug cartels to overthrow their local governments, and where our ""freedom and liberty"" are ""secured"" by making sure you have neither freedom nor liberty.  Poverty persists because we are a poor nation in a gilded cage, not because of ""government handouts."""

The burger flipper who dropped out in 10th grade now makes more than the technician with the associates degree. Now you make it more expensive for all businesses -- especially startups and small businesses -- so you confer more advantage to the largest companies. You also force companies to streamline operations (entrepreneurs will simply work more hours rather than hire) plus you accelerate the adoption of technology for low-skilled jobs. That makes unemployment skyrocket -- like a switch was thrown. These quickly overwhelm -- give it six to nine months -- any benefit. Then in one to two years, all of your problems are far worse than ever before.   Show me one case in history where price controls have had anything other than a deleterious effect in the mid- to long-run. (Wages are prices; a minimum wage is a price control.)   Don't get me wrong...I'm with you...I'd like to help people get a leg up. But the answer to poverty is not some short term fix. If you really want to correct poverty, start with schools (not a matter of more spending but rather radical reform -- would you really build a brick and mortar school system if you were starting from scratch today?).   Also roll back the welfare state. The more incentives we create for people to do nothing, the more people who will be satisfied with doing nothing. (Improving education will go a long way toward getting people to see the benefit of getting off their butts!)   (You have to be a truly lazy, ignorant, ideologue to down vote without some counter.)"
starterpacks,393ibg,crowscountingspades,19,Tue Jun 9 20:59:48 2015 UTC,"Also roll back the welfare state.   Just.. stop there.  Firstly: There's no such thing as ""indefinite welfare."" It does not exist. So, we're going to to address what you may mean by ""welfare state.""    If you're on permanent disability, it's because you're too physically or mentally disabled to effectively work. Also, disability requires several doctors to verify, and is notoriously difficult to maintain - the state will, effectively, keep bothering you and your physician on a yearly basis to ensure that you're still incapable of effective work. If the state, at any point, thinks you're lying... you'll not only lose your benefits, but you'll face prosecution. Every state takes disability claims exceptionally seriously.    Maybe you aren't talking about permanent disability - maybe just unemployment? So, have you ever been laid off before? Unemployment requires you have worked for an extended length of time in order to claim it - and, the amount you get is directly proportional to the money you were making when you were working (though, there's always a cap). If you were making minimum wage for a few months somewhere, you aren't going to be eligible for unemployment. Fun fact: Unemployment is a small tax you pay throughout the year, if you have a W2, and what you pay is only for your unemployment benefits. Effectively, the state is helping provide you with a small safety net. That's not really welfare - since you're paying for it.    So, if unemployment insurance and permanent disability aren't welfare, maybe you're talking about Medicaid? So, let's discuss Medicaid, and why it exists. So, back in the 60's, the United States was starting to face an interesting problem: We had states in our glorious union where people were too poor to pay for their own medical care. This wasn't any fault of their own, you see. As it turns out, Hospitals and doctors had already had a decent history, in this country, of drastically overcharging their patients - a practice which had started during the American Gilded Age, when the US was experiencing exceptional economic growth. Naturally, this created a problem - The possibility of people committing crimes to earn the income to pay for their treatments and other medical costs was real. Mind you, this was before the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act of 1986. Back in the 60's, if you couldn't pay, then you didn't get treatment. Period. It didn't matter if you were dying right there, you were shit out of luck.  So, Medicaid was thought-up as a temporary solution to that problem. Not every tax-paying citizen in our country has the ability to pay taxes, feed themselves, and also pay for their medical care, under our ""free market economy"" of available medical treatment. But, that's not really welfare, either, since the only reason it exists is because nobody in our government wanted to reign-in medical pricing at the time - that's really a short-coming of the government, than anything.    So if it's not medicaid, or unemployment insurance, or permanent disability, then what could it be? Perhaps you mean retirement benefits? Though, you couldn't possibly... since you pay for those, too! Perhaps you mean the ""welfare"" of having a government that builds infrastructure for transportation, or provides schools for education? But, surely, that can't be considered welfare, either - everybody pays for those equally.  In reality, the concept of a ""welfare state"" is nonsense. Such a thing doesn't exist, and people who propagate the illusion that it does are simply very upset that they have to pay taxes at all, thinking themselves somehow better than their fellows because they have had the fortune not to have a severe run of a bad luck just yet."

By the way, I'm in no way upset about paying taxes in general. What upsets me is that I'm paying far more taxes than necessary thanks to government waste (who needs the departments of energy, education or weights and measures?) as well as for many, many people who commit welfare fraud or who are here illegally.   It also offends me that our leaders are living like kings and queens while so many are suffering.

But we've moved from a culture of ""I can do it on my own"" to a culture of entitlement.   I talk to young people all the time and it's just about all I hear. The government should give us this. The government should give us that.   But what they're not getting is that the government can't give you anything it hasn't taken from someone else.   And here's the thing. Punish accomplishment and hard work (with taxes and handouts so others can live well without working) -- you get less hard work. Reward sloth, get more sloth. It's not a good long-term formula.   Back to the shame thing, it USED to be that if you were on government support, you felt not only a degree of shame (""I WANT to support myself!"") but also gratitude (thank goodness someone is helping me).   Now...no shame...no gratitude. Just entitlement."
starterpacks,393ibg,crowscountingspades,10,Wed Jun 10 20:20:11 2015 UTC,"I think you are putting an awful lot of psychological baggage on an entire generation of Americans just to justify your outdated economic opinions. Your only argument for how today's culture is more 'entitled' is a bunch of anecdotal statements about how ""young people"" think the government owes them everything in the world, with no actual anecdotes. Well guess what, buddy, you are cherrypicking the worst of the worst of today's generation and you are grossly misremembering the kind of assistance your generation received in its turn.   The minimum wage in this country, adjusting or inflation, is lower than it was when you (a 50+ year old) got out of high school. The job market is also heavily skewed toward employers in the current climate, with more jobs departing overseas each year, even with wages at already unsustainable levels. Also, for anyone who wants to get a college degree and try to improve their station, tuitions are several degrees of magnitude higher than they were when you were college age. The net result is that even the highly motivated and self-dependent will find themselves in six figures of debt before they turn 21, with more competition for existing jobs than at any point prior, often forced to live on minimum wage jobs for lack of anything else in their local job market. If you think that people on minimum wage are typically lazy or unmotivated to do better, you have clearly never attempted to live on minimum wage.  Here's another thing: the government is already handing out welfare hand over fist in a lot of states, IN ORDER TO MAKE UP for the underpayment of retailers paying minimum wage. In just my state, for example, someone working minimum wage 40 hours a week makes a little under $1400/month. Rent in my city for a single-occupant studio apartment averages $1600-1800/month. Do you think you could live on -$200/month? If that money doesn't come from the employer, it's coming from the state in the form of food stamps. Who do you think is both better equipped and more obliged to sponsor the welfare of these employees, the company paying for their labor or the taxpayer? Because right now, as long as the minimum wage lags this far behind, the taxpayer holds the tab."
starterpacks,393ibg,Aconator,-5,Wed Jun 10 20:25:48 2015 UTC,"My outdated opinions? Anecdotal evidence? Fine...  My foolish views are based on capitalism which has built the greatest economy the world has ever known as well as help pull the rest of the world up along with it.   As for the minimum wage, that's set by the marketplace. It has nothing to do with inflation. Nor should it. As I've explained to others in this thread, if you want more money, be more valuable. If you want wages for low skilled jobs to increase, then decrease the flow of low skilled workers.   By the way, no one is entitled to a lifestyle. This is the land of opportunity. What you are entitled to is the pursuit of happiness. You are not guaranteed a living wage. You are not guaranteed a car. You are not guaranteed a phone or healthcare. Guarantees of that nature come from Marxism/Socialism. Ever hear of the USSR? Know what it was like to live in China under Mao? Talk to those who have seen true poverty before you bitch and moan about conditions in this country. And then ask yourself, is that the system you want to gravitate towards? One with massive government control? That's where we're heading.    As for the quality of life appearing to decline? What it's doing is equilibrating. We've been the strongest economy in the world for a very long time. Now other nations are catching up. But instead of fighting for our competitive lives, no, we are capitulating, growing the scale and scope of government and plunging headlong toward socialism. You can't see this, likely due to your age. But someone like me, who has been living here and abroad for so long writing about issues just like this, for me, the shift is breathtaking. I hear and see things now that 50 years ago would have gotten you beaten up on the playground for saying them. Take my word for it, the cultural shift is immense.   As for the taxpayer holding the tab, there we agree. And that's what's wrong. But you blame Wal-Mart. I don't. They're merely responding to the economics around them. Which all people and all companies will also do.   I blame a government that creates conditions that enables Wal-Mart to do what it's doing. Too many regulations. Too many entitlements. Taxes that are among the highest in the industrialized world. Borders that are too porous. (Not just illegals from the south but did you hear about Disney replacing US workers with H1B visa immigrants.) Government literally begs large companies to ship jobs offshore then enables, through a flood of immigrant, low-skilled workers, low wages.   I could go on...but I have to write other things for real money. Suffice it to say, the answer is not socialism. The answer is capitalism."

This isn't the 60's or 70's anymore where people put in 40 hours a week and supported their families without the government's help. It's not about entitlement, it's about the government allowing companies treat their employees like slaves, with no blow back. Right now we are in a state where people aren't making enough money to purchase things, which slows down the economy more then anything since we have a consumer economy. Also, taxes aren't a punishment, they are a necessity, if nobody pays taxes, who will pay for roads and schools?

I've been trying for 3 years to find a better job. The market is a horrible place right now, as I'm sure you're aware.  I think part of the reason why people aren't that ashamed of being on government assistance right now is because there are so many people who are on it. It's a common experience for people at a similar place in life to me. Our employers won't pay us a living wage, and unions basically don't exist anymore, so government assistance is a necessity for a lot of us. The shame doesn't outweigh the need for a decent diet and a roof over our heads.  So yes, maybe there used to be a lot of shame involved with being on government support. People also used to be able to afford a house and a car on the salary of a factory worker. Times have changed.

starterpacks,393ibg,deHavillandDash8Q400,4,Tue Jun 9 23:18:38 2015 UTC,"Most of the points you make are total strawmen. Let me counter with a few of my own:  You say that a ""price floor"" on labor would reduce demand for labor, but demand for labor is not as fluid as you imply. In fact, the dominant economic consensus is that minimum wage increases on the scale proposed would have no discernable effect on the labor market. In fact, a wage hike to $11 an hour would simply put us at purchasing parity with ourselves circa 1960.   If an activity isn't profitable without a slave wage, then maybe it isn't being done in a sustainably profitable way. Plus, there is no evidence to suggest that any jobs are directly threatened except perhaps by automation, which is going to become more profitable than human employees in the next half century regardless of whether we pay humans more or not.   The black market for illegal labor is already as huge is it could be; it's not like there are immigrants in Mexico just waiting for us to hike the minimum wage so they can pour across the border to scab for us. They're here, they're working jobs already alongside Americans making minimum wage, and that has nothing to do with this issue either way.  Technology already outstrips employees and that's not changing. An employee has training costs, uniforms, wages, perhaps benefits.  A machine has only a startup cost and maybe some maintenance years down the road. If we're all comparing ourselves to machines to determine our worth in society, maybe we should start paying accountants below minimum wage since TurboTax exists. As long as we start with the assumption that there is any reason to hire a human being at all, implicit in that should be the notion that they deserve to be adequately compensated for it.   No, because it simply raises the first step to a level where it's actually a 'step' and not a pothole. Everyone needs an entry-level job. In fact, our economy depends on a fair number of people STAYING at those jobs for years, even decades, or else everyone would always be a trainee and nobody would know how to do their own jobs. Companies lose a lot of money training a revolving door or depressed drifters that they could save by retaining one happy, productive employee. Some companies know this and have voluntarily raised wages. Others rely on the fact that their employees are so underpaid that they still qualify for food stamps as a way to make ends meet, and consider that part of their business model. That may be sustainable for them, but not for us, the taxpayers footing that bill.  That is wild speculation based on nothing and I won't even bother to refute it. When has a company ever said ""gee we seem to be a little short of money, we'd better start pruning the managerial staff""?  If most companies could be passing on more costs to consumers, it would have happened already. Low prices are the main driver for soliciting business away from a competitor. If one company hikes prices due to new minimum wage laws and the other doesn't, that second company will make more than the difference back in new business, due to the fact that they will be undercutting their competitors.   Lastly, and most importantly, you seem to totally misunderstand to motivations of the average worker on minimum wage. Most people who could obtain the credentials, or resume, or references to get a higher paying job would be doing so right at this moment. The typical low-end worker is someone who has limited access to the workforce. The reasons are many. Some can't afford to drop everything and go into debt to go back to school; some have children young and do not have time to raise a child and hunt for a better job; many are just living paycheck to paycheck and couldn't get a student loan if they tried, due to poor credit and less than perfect grades. Plenty of college grads are leaving school and taking minimum wage jobs because the field they prepared for is too full or qualified grads already. The majority of people working for minimum wage are doing so because it was the only available work. These jobs matter, or else nobody would be doing them and we would have to grill our own burgers when we go to Wendy's. Our economy doesn't work without a certain portion of the populace working these jobs, so to tell EVERYONE to just rise up and do better is disingenuous. EVERYONE can't rise up; that is physically impossible. So to make it comfortable to get by as a low-wage worker isn't letting people be lazy, it's acknowledging that they aren't poor by choice and they ARE working as hard as the rest of us, but that our system DEMANDS that some people work poor, dead-end jobs in order to support the infrastructure that allows the well-off to survive."
starterpacks,393ibg,Aconator,2,Wed Jun 10 04:09:26 2015 UTC,"because at your current minimum wage there's no incentive for me to get a real job over say, dealing drugs.  But you know, raising minimum wage has actually increased job creation in the states that have done it. Technology has created more jobs than its destroyed, despite popular belief. Immigration creates more jobs than it takes over the long-term. There will be more higher paid positions because there will be more people in a position to start an enterprise.  Putting the savings purely into business DOES NOT help the economy. The 'trickle-down' theory of economics doesnt work, history has proven that in most cases, the savings on labour go into the businesses pocket, rather than the community. These businessmen then go on to open more businesses that would otherwise be unprofitably inefficient were they to pay fair wages. Sharing the wealth means more people have more opportunity to start an enterprise which leads to more innovation and ingenuity.  But think about it for 99% of businesses, the buck starts at a low-level consumer, they buy a product or service from a business and other business service the first one. If you raise minimum wage, everyone has more money to spend, that first business does better and can better utilize the secondary ones. You can use this same argument for welfare.  This is to say nothing of the fact we all only have ONE life and I don't believe anyone should have to struggle and suffer their entire lives while others lavish in the highest luxury because they were born their. That sounds like fuedalism."

starterpacks,3875zf,jessek,9,Tue Jun 2 15:51:49 2015 UTC,"A problem of a default sub. Flicks and truefilm have 'what did you watch this week?' that differs so greatly from the r/movies one. Such little diversity that one of their mods went to /r/moviescirclejerk to post ""Which Mad Max did you watch this week?"".  Surprisingly one of the better default subs though. The rules are great. For submissions: No memes, no 'circlejerk posts' (redundant posts with no new insight that are about any super popular film/director), no redundant production news or rumours, etc. Huge contrast between /r/movies and similarly sized default /r/gaming.

He isn't as prolific in output or as good in skill as Spielberg but I would very much call the hype and reaction to Nolan, from fans and studios, very similar to Spielberg as a blockbuster hype  train.

starterpacks,3875zf,DEMAG,13,Tue Jun 2 19:30:25 2015 UTC,Interstellar was horrible.......?  :(
starterpacks,3875zf,NewRedditorHere,10,Tue Jun 2 13:54:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe horrible was too harsh. I felt it had a lot to be desired due to lazy writing.   There were parts that I liked. I loved the interactions between the robots and Cooper. I liked the worlds they visited and the warping of time. But some pivotal parts were just ridiculous.   For example, the whole finding NASA's secret base which turned out he was destined to find because of future Cooper was weak. Also for him to drop everything on a whim to travel across the universe just felt rushed so the emotion didn't transfer to me. That's just lazy writing that could have been fixed with a few simple edits.   Dr. Mann going crazy in order to interject some tension felt forced in order to have the audience be all like ""Holy shit, Matt Damon!"".   Worst of all was ejecting in a black hole then suddenly being spit out next to the rings of saturn completly unharmed. Lazy writing. But that's my opinion. But we can all agree /r/movies is a circlejerk and /r/boxoffice is more fun."
starterpacks,3875zf,DEMAG,6,Tue Jun 2 14:32:27 2015 UTC,"/r/truefilm has great in depth and high quality discussion and /r/flicks is a good middle ground between movies and truefilm with many diverse, well reasoned opinions. All subs mostly look at fairly mainstream movies too so they're easy to contribute to or at least understand   Sort by top/all time to see good discussions they've had"
starterpacks,3875zf,NewRedditorHere,4,Tue Jun 2 14:36:22 2015 UTC,"The screenwriting was definitely a 7.5, in my opinion. I DEFINITELEY would have changed the ""you found us. It's your destiny"" aspect into a ""we've been tracking you. You are the most qualified for this mission"" narrative. And I could definitely see how you're critical of the overnight decision to leave his family to save mankind. But I wasn't super critical of it, personally. But everyone is different, I understand that. But you have to admit that the tension is there throughout 75% of the movie. The audio production is 10/10 and the cinematography is so unique and realistic.   And I love Nicolas Refn. Although I am aware that his movies do come off very pretentious. But I like movies with a slow atmosphere. Not everyone's cup of tea tho."
starterpacks,3875zf,RacG79,2,Tue Jun 2 14:46:22 2015 UTC,"The tension I was hoping for was the human struggle in space not Matt Damon going wacko. I was hoping for more stuff like roving asteroid particles jacking up the ship and now we need to adapt with the worlds best pilot to accomplish the mission. Of course Hanz Zimmer delivers and the practical/cgi effects and cinematography were awesome. It annoyed me that simple fixes would have saved a lot of it.  That's I feel about Refn, I think Cohen's did it better with No Country. For me Drive didn't carry the tension like No Country did. I wanted to like Drive but I just couldn't get into it like I did with No Country. Drive soundtrack was awesome though. I love Kavinsky."
starterpacks,3875zf,DEMAG,3,Tue Jun 2 15:01:14 2015 UTC,"Matt Damon going whacko was only a smidge of the tension.  You have him, the gigantic wave that's about to hit the aircraft, the use of the black hole to propel themselves, the commandeering(at the end) of the aircraft to align with the other revolving aircraft, etc.  There were a bunch of elements that made up the tension, not just the Matt Damon part of it.    And yeah, Refn doesn't really attract many people.  The best atmosphere movie ever, IMO, is 2001: A Space Odyssey."

starterpacks,3875zf,arrozconplatano,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:48:10 2015 UTC,"I really liked Interstellar and watched it several times. I also agree with every point you made.  Question, is there a movie that's perfectly written and not lazy at any point? Is there a movie who's plot stands up to scrutiny, had nothing forced, is completely logical, and is this movie any good?  I feel like the trend for criticism toward movies these days is to just nit pick everything that isn't perfect. As if as long as there's something that doesn't make sense, it's not a good movie. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of examples of movies that are so ridiculous that no one can suspend disbelief. Yet I seriously doubt there's a movie that makes perfect sense. And if there is, would it be any fun to watch?  I never bothered to think deeply about why things happened in Interstellar and maybe that's why I was able to enjoy it. As long as I lived in the moment and wanted to know what happens next, I couldn't care why it was written that way. It just had to make enough sense for me not to question it.  I'm not saying you're wrong. You make valid points. I understand that logical flaws can completely destroy someone's ability to enjoy a film. I just don't think it's enough to not enjoy the movie despite its flaws.  And honestly, do you think maybe you don't like Interstellar so much because you hated all the circlejerking by the Nolan fanboys? And that causes you to cling to whatever flaws you can find in order to validate your feelings towards it? If so, it's only human. Been there plenty of times myself."

starterpacks,364bqp,YawIar,7,Sun May 17 00:12:06 2015 UTC,"I think thats a Mennonite thing.  Most of my family on my mother's side are Pentecostal, but I agree that every church is different.  There is United Pentecostals, which is I believe is who Borat fucked with.  My brother, when he had joined their ranks, ironically had his bible stolen at the same church that was shown in the movie.    The rules i remember from when I was a kid was as followed: Women - no pants or anything that can be decribed as too masculine. -long sleeves are preferred, but 3/4 sleeves are usually overlooked -no make-up - skirts must be worn long enough to touch the ancles (I've see hemlines rise over the years much to the elders dismay) -hair can NEVER be cut trimming it was even frowned upon -no jewelry but weddng ring  Men -hair must neverget long enough cover ears or collar -must be clean shaven -long sleeves required, but no ones gonna tell a farmer he can't roll up his sleeves -cannot wear anything considered feminine  Some general rules and oppressions.  -no tv -take off your shoes when entering a house  -10% of income goes to the church -women must obey their husbands -various fundamental bull  This is just what I've surmised from childhood.  I do remember the women cooking thanksgiving dinner and then not being allowed to eat at the table, they were put with us kids.  My uncle was a preacher and I remember a lot of crying and tounges being spoken at the one service my parents brought us to.  We never went back, I was small at the time and I think it scared me to see so many grown ups crying.  I do recall my surprise that there were so many black people there.  One thing I will give em was they weren't racist like that. Turns out my uncle has a mixed daughter the same age as his son.  We found out years later.  I think that maybe I would be a more spiritual person if I hadn't been told I was going to hell for wearing pants at 8 years old.  My brother fell into it and even went to bible college in Mississippi for a while.  Now he's a hipster atheist who will probably become the nutty professor.  I love it when people start going all fundamental on him and he pulls out his bible knowledge on them and shut them down.  I'm not an atheist, but this always makes me giggle."

I have to haul in the carts so my job is quite tiring. He doesn't give a fuck and he goes out every 30 minutes for a smoke break. Just last week he got arrested at work because he was caught bringing out boxes upon boxes of stolen food out to his car. We looked at security footage and he's been doing it for months. So the next day we called the cops. I was out in the parking lot when he was put into the cop car. I made eye contact with him as his head was being pushed down into it. It was a sweet moment.

The only people who liked him were the managers because he was such a brown nose. He was once restocking a bottom shelf and my friend Dan walked by and says ""on your knees where you belong, Nathan?"" I was talking to my girlfriend and he told me to get back to work. So, I turned to my girlfriend and said ""I'd better go before someone with real authority comes along."" But Goddamn was he fucking arrogant. His status was basically assistant manager without the title or authority, but he pretended he did. In short, he was everyone's bitch. If you needed something he had to go get it. Then, he got promoted. It was like Fox News with climate change, no one wanted to believe it. Within a week of his promotion three people got suspended from their jobs. My friend Mike almost got fired because he was out the day our boss announced his promotion and still treated him like shit. He tried so hard to get Sarah, the woman who got me my job, fired. She probably had the least respect for Nate before his promotion and refused to accept it. Once he had power he exacted revenge on everyone, made people get stuff for him, he'd just let people squirm rather than help them. He constantly vaping too. I'm not talking little smoke puffs I'm talking fucking full on clouds. I swear he would do it, just to make sure it blew in someone's face, his own smug little revenge I suppose. Best part was he would leave every ten minutes or so to vape but bite your head off if you took five minute or more to set up a cart , which take about six minutes to set up by the way. When I quit he tried to be all buddy-buddy with me, talking about how much he would miss me and all I could think was ""Fuck off""."

I immediately say nope, he sits down next to me, winks at the girl, and asks me what's going on in the world.

starterpacks,35f2yv,thinbranch,77,Sun May 10 01:55:27 2015 UTC,"Surely this is a staple of the weeaboo, but what this image is trying to represent is that slightly overweight, ponytailed, unhygienic asian girl who has greasy hair (and 2mm pedo 'stache) and draws anime characters all day in the back of the class. This type of person doesn't hang out with anyone outside of school except her parents, and doesn't care about their appearance (hence the hair and lack of hygiene), so they just wear whatever clothing they have, which is entirely composed of shitty tshirts from family 10k runs or public picnics.   So while this character is definitely a weeaboo, their clothing differs from that of the classic weeaboo because of their specific lifestyle. Weeaboo is a secondary characteristic."
starterpacks,35f2yv,ColonParentheses,23,Sun May 10 02:43:33 2015 UTC,wow your analysis is spot on haha
starterpacks,35f2yv,ColonParentheses,17,Sun May 10 03:14:13 2015 UTC,"I've got considerable experience with this character. I usually refer to them as 'One Face Chinese' (OFC) people, because they've always only got (surprise surprise) one expression. It's either a sleepy mouth-breathing blank stare or an awkward unwavering half-smile.   I see OFC around the volunteering stuff I do a lot, since they're from families that push the high-achieving Asian agenda, but because the OFC themselves don't have any outgoing interests (like sports, music besides piano or violin, dance, non-anime sketching art), they have to pad out the resume with low-level community service.   A good example of this is the marathons that I do lead cycling for (I'm the cyclist in front of the runners that keeps the on course). All runs have volunteers on the side holding signs that say ""keep going!"" or ""almost there!"", and who are holding these signs and half-assedly moving them up and down? OFC. I shit you not; during the most recent run that I lead cycled for, I made a shitty pun at a OFC, and she didn't laugh, or scoff, or ignore me, no, her half-smile remained predictably unwavering as she gave a soft-voiced ""oh my goodness"".   I've got a bit of a thing against OFC because they give chinese kids like myself a bad name. One of my friends the other day was saying how they really hate chinese people (mentioning that he didn't mean me), and proceeded to describe the OFC. It sucks because they've become the majority, at least where I live (Vancouver BC), so a lot of people are starting to hold this opinion, and it totally discredits chinese kids like me who do interesting things and actually get out there because we want to, not just to pad a resume, and who have more than one expression.   So if you ever encounter a OFC, please understand that they do not represent all chinese kids, and that there are some of us who are genuinely cool people."

I'm not blaming you for it, I just think one day you will feel guilty for all the hate you used to direct at your own people."
starterpacks,35f2yv,ColonParentheses,7,Wed Jun 3 04:26:02 2015 UTC,"I hate the behaviours that happen to be exemplified exclusively by members of my own race, and the effect that this has on others' perceptions of my own race and, of course, myself. I wouldn't have such a vendetta against OFC if they were not exclusively Chinese, because in that case their behaviour would not impact me to any significant extent, but they are (exclusively Chinese), so I do (have a vendetta against them).   The black Uncle Toms had an illegitimate hatred of black people, because weed was smoked and pants were sagged among all races (even though these were primarily black things), so they felt guilty after because they realized this illegitimacy.   If, when I grow old, there exist just as prevalent a population of OFC as there exists today, I will still hate them just as much as I do now, for the same reasons.   My point is that behaviour that is detrimental to oneself and others deserves hatred, and that one should not feel guilty about this kind of hatred, because it is justified."

starterpacks,35f2yv,ColonParentheses,4,Wed Jun 3 08:17:01 2015 UTC,"Who did they inherit the behaviours of OFC from? Being pushed to achieve is a product of their family, but that's not what I find detrimental. It is the lack of personality, proper motivation, and more than one expression that I take issue with, and none of these traits are inherited. These are qualities that OFC simply haven't developed on their own like everyone else. And it's not like they haven't had equal opportunity to do so; They attend school with the general public. They cannot have inherited a lack of something, they've simply failed to develop it on their own."

starterpacks,34wfaw,Mechanicalmind,0,Tue May 5 20:07:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, true. But that's not all you have to keep in mind when choosing lenses. Consider also the use you're going to make of them. Are you going to wear one pair of glasses indoors and outdoors but not driving? Then transitions are good to go. Are you a driver? Forget about transitions (also the ""Xtractive"" ones suck. They're slow, don't get completely clear and can't be used indoors because they get dark with artificial light, too), consider making two pair of glasses: one for indoors and a graduated pair of sun lenses with a cool frame. Are you going to use them indoors only? Normal glasses. Plus, if you're working on a pc, consider getting some blue antireflex coating on your lenses, your eyes won't get as tired as with normal AR coating.  Source: i make ophthalmic machines for a living."
starterpacks,34wfaw,ok_ill_shut_up,2,Mon May 18 09:19:31 2015 UTC,Apparently people don't like that.
starterpacks,34wfaw,Work-After,28,Tue May 5 19:12:33 2015 UTC,"I can take a guess.  Sunglasses that adhere to classic models (think Rayban's Pilots, Wayfarer, Clubmaster, etc) are considered cool. If you're engaging in some kind of outsdoor activity like bicycling, sailing, hiking and so forth there are sunglasses associated with them.  Transitions are normal looking glasses that transform into sunglasses and look out of place because they do not adhere to how ""cool sunglasses"" look. Most (young) people who are aware of this just put on contact lenses with sunglasses on top. The ones who aren't aware or simply don't care wear transitions... Many of which fit into other, not so nice stereotypes, which in turn perpetuates the sentiment that they are not cool.  TL;DR: By trying to combine two different functionalities (corrective eye wear + sun protection), transitions sacrifice the fashion/aesthetics aspect of sunglasses."
starterpacks,34wfaw,thmz,12,Tue May 5 08:55:26 2015 UTC,Or you could just buy sunglasses with prescription lenses. My Clubmasters are prescription and I got them and my Clubmaster eyeglasses 50% off so I decided to get 2 birds with one stone.
starterpacks,34wfaw,Work-After,7,Tue May 5 20:15:26 2015 UTC,"The slight problem with that is that you'll have to keep switching between normal glasses and prescription glasses, forcing you to keep track of two different cases. It's easier to just have contact lenses and sunglasses, sunglasses others can borrow.  Also, as someone who lives in the North, I like the feel of the summer wind against my face, and doing fun summer activities with my friends. Contact lenses are just nicer than normal glasses in that way."

It's more of an umbrella term that is used to group together the more ridiculous types of feminism that have become more prominent like TERFs, SWERFs, whatever, all these branches that have sprouted from feminism.   An ""average"" feminist, is just anyone who believes in equality.   So no, I do not lump any person who believes in equality of opportunity, regardless of gender, with people who send death threats to Christina Hoff Sommers.   I'm not backpedalling, I wish you'd stop accusing me of that. The whole point of my original post is to point out the different meaning, I did not change what I'm saying at all.   Anyways, please consider that you are trying to tell me, someone who actually uses these terms, what I mean when I use them."

There is no evidence of this - you fabricated this claim.    It's more of an umbrella term that is used to group together the more ridiculous types of feminism    So you just decided ""modern"" refers to this ""umbrella"" term? Based on what criteria? Whose ass are you pulling these arbitrary definitions from? MRA?  You've done nothing but make ad-hoc backpedaling unjustified attempts to defend you illogical and unevidenced claims.

starterpacks,348c2j,TruthFromAnAsshole,4,Sat May 16 02:58:31 2015 UTC,"No, Emma Watson is pretty widely loved by nearly every feminist. Not because she wants to bring men into feminism, but because she's articulate, intelligent, and uses her influence to bring attention to women's issues.  Reddit loves to blame ""radfems"" for ""ruining feminism,"" but radfems are few and far between, and they're often criticized by the majority of feminists for excluding trans people, among other groups.   Emma Watson is beloved and important not because she's pandering to men, but because she's a vocal outspoken feminist. She represents the vast majority of feminists."

It's this thing people call a joke. See it's funny because, as every knows, feminists come in all shapes and sizes, appearances and genders. However a very vocal and outspoken group of feminists tend to actually fit this very specific mold.   So as we all know, humour is just irony, and irony is:   ""an event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case""    So where's the irony is this post? So because of the very vocal feminists who fit the mold of the post, what feminists appear to be is the tumblrina SRS fatty with died hair and an unreasonable hatred for all men. When what is actually the case when defining a feminist is that a feminist can pretty much be everyone and anyone. The Irony found in what a feminist is and what we perceive them as comes from the very outspoken group of feminist. So defining feminists by that group is funny, because we all know they don't actually represent the majority but they appear to because they're so loud!  What even adds to that irony is that the most outspoken of these feminists tend to also have views and opinions which actually contradict the views and ideals of actual feminism! This is what makes the hypocrisy of SRS so hilarious (Same goes for MRA and everyone involved in the gamergate discussion!).  So do you understand humour yet?"

The lengths of the tracks are usually around 7 and 10 minutes and lie between 120-130 bpm. This style of house music can often have an acoustic feeling.  Deep house has gained popularity over the years according to Beatport, being one of its top sellers among genres.

End result is an interesting man who doesn't persue women, but interacts with them as equals and attracts them because he is interesting and not desperate   I'm not even a red piller, but I read before I pass judgment  You ignorant people are the worst, whichever side you're on"

They want men to feel valuable and contributing people to society. You should be the best man you can be. Exercise daily, have fun productive hobbies and be social. Enjoy being an equal and don't fall victim to manipulative people. The world is only self interest, so do your best to stay ahead of the game.   What they are missing is subtly and morals (in some posts and advice, not all).  Some will say to do this ""by any means necessary"" they use offensive language as an attempt to condescend their opponents. They throw all obvious values out the window to achieve what they think will give them a purpose. It's not simply, ""men rule, girls drool""  mentality it's ""be dominant in life on every way possible and you will be happy""  when I really don't think at the end of the day you will be.   I do think believing in yourself and showing the world you do have value is important as a man. Maybe visit /r/EMSK or something similar for more positive ways to be a man."

I have read a few posts on the sub, agree with some ideas, but when it comes to treating women like shit, I pass over the advice.  When it comes to personal accountability and becoming the best you can be, TRP is a good resource.  From what I can tell, the reason why they talk the way they do is because they don't like being taken advantage of by women. It's the whole concept of 'pussypass' and not wanting a woman to use her gender as a crutch. Also, some women simply like being talked down to, and that sub is for those specific people. I wouldn't want to be with a SO that wants me to talk down to them, but it's not like I'm going to stop certain people from wanting that."

starterpacks,329cca,EveryoneLikesToHaha,12,Sun Apr 12 05:14:30 2015 UTC,I was getting over a fever and felt like shit and decided to clean up my diet and lifestyle so I thought I'd go vegan for a month. It's not so much I missed the meat and dairy (I of course did) it was always having to be aware and the limited freedom of choice.
starterpacks,329cca,kitty-committee,13,Sat Apr 11 21:47:02 2015 UTC,"I get that. There are some really shitty meat substitutes, but there are also a few good ones. The key is to go slow, and slowly transition yourself into so you don't overwhelm yourself. I was a huge meat eater for most of my life, and went vegan for ethical reasons over a year ago. At first, I missed meat and was super frustrated by how it seemed fucking everything had dairy, eggs, or other subtle animal products in it. But, slowly but surely, I began discovering a bunch of new and healthy foods that were actually delicious. It just takes time to learn what your options are. I rarely crave anything anymore, because I've mostly gotten past my non vegan food desires. I'm a big dude with a hearty appetite, but I still find that my diet is really satisfying.

The only thing that is maybe explicitly against the rules is the backpack since it's military gear and not meant to be worn in civilian clothes. Like, you can't wear the camo pants from your uniform with a t shirt when you're off duty, but I really don't know if that applies to the backpacks too. Depending on who your commander is, the shirt miiiiiiiiiiiight be considered inappropriate. But if you're out of the military, you can wear pretty much whatever you want. You can't wear a full uniform or anything since you're not a soldier anymore, but the rest should be fine. Unless he meant ""code of conduct"" like the guidelines for how a Marine/Marine who's out should act/dress."

starterpacks,3054k7,JakeArvizu,4,Tue Mar 24 23:55:32 2015 UTC,"Define good at fighting. Some of them do freefight or some other martial art and of course it helps but generally in France all that happens more spontaneously.   The visiting group walks in the streets of the receiving city making sure they are seen, the receiving groups try to find them and they fight when they find each other.   It gives very chaotic fights with urban furniture flying and so on until either the cops arrive or one of the group breaks and begin running, it looks much more like riots with charges, counter-charges and lots of projectile throwing than organized fights.  I would say the individual skills of the fighters don't matter as much as the group cohesion and number. Even if you are great at karate, krav maga or something if the group of guys in front of you have been fighting together for years they will destroy you because any time you will engage one of them two others will come to his help and even if they are bad you will have to pull back or get the shit beaten out of you.

starterpacks,2z6xep,ABadManComes,6,Mon Mar 16 08:23:18 2015 UTC,"Gopnik:       Gopnik (Russian: го́пник)  is a pejorative term and a social slur used in Russia and post-Soviet countries (including Israel) to refer to young lower-class suburban male dwellers (usually under 30 years of age) coming from families of poor education and income, somewhat similar to British chavs, spides or neds sub-cultures. The gopnik stereotype is known for his predominant use of ""Russian criminal"" Blat slang, his flagrant disrespect for the laws (such as public consumption of alcoholic beverages, most usually — the least obvious ""Jaguar"" cocktail) and his love for snacking on roasted sunflower seeds while remaining squatted. Fashion preferences include Adidas tracksuits and dress shoes. In the winter, a leather jacket and flatcap hat (known as ""Gondonka"") are added to a typical Gopnik's attire. The female counterpart of the gopnik is known as ""сиповка"" (sipovka) or ""босячка"" (bosyachka) — all translating as ""tomboy"" from Blat.

Is this the ultimate survival paradigm of the meme?  Is my consciousness not a meme? Is it not but a collection of patterns expressed through physical state of my brain, just as memes are ideas expressed through the state of everybody's brains?   in conclusion, behold my philosophy, for I am a dank meme within a grander dank scheme, and without a collection of dank memes within myself i would not exist."

starterpacks,2xnt6d,RalphWaldoNeverson,-6,Tue Mar 3 19:30:08 2015 UTC,"Neither can most programmers, unfortunately.  Or at least... neither can most CS graduates: http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/"
starterpacks,2xnt6d,RJAG,7,Mon Mar 9 23:55:29 2015 UTC,The first few links don't ever actually say that most programmers can't program. That blog post is based on other blog posts based on Other blog posts that none of them seemed to even read thoroughly. Apparently programmers can't read.
starterpacks,2xnt6d,RalphWaldoNeverson,-1,Tue Mar 10 02:31:17 2015 UTC,"I checked the inception of links, and I still stick by the saying ""most programmers can't program.""  Perhaps you (as well as Shelley) were misinterpreting the meaning of such a statement.  Clearly programmers can program. Even an incompetent kid with elementary understanding of computer science can program. It doesn't take much to learn to program. Someone could learn to program in a few days, at most. So no one will argue that ""programmers can't program"".  What is scary- is that even an elementary understanding of programming can resolve the Fizz-Buzz test. Yet 199/200 applicants failed it. That is telling in and of itself of some problem. It cannot be so readily explained away by the inception of links you're referring to. Their arguments are not strong enough. So yes, those programmers who wrote those blogs CAN read. They just don't find people like Shelley's arguments (comparing CS Applicants to Dating Sites Members) valid enough to change their opinions.  What this insinuates- the failure of 199/200 applicants when confronted with a very simple test- is that ""programmers can't program well."" IMO, and to many others, since it's such a simple test, it implies programmers can't program well at all. Their ability to even program is questionable. (Which are the issues the blogs raise).  The argument from Shelley, is weak at best. She argues that the 200 applicants do not represent most programmers. That they actually represent a minority of programmers, while all other programmers already have jobs. This ignores the basic logic that those programmers had to apply for their jobs. Whether or not it was 199/200, it is not unreasonable to predict the number of failures would be very high even if we roll back time where CS degrees were not as popular and the field was not as flooded (although it isn't flooded, as there is an incredible need for programmers now and in the predictable future, which only reveals things will get worse- not better, even if Shelley is right. Over time, if the trend is consistent (199/200) then eventually most programmers WILL not know how to program.)  Anyway, I have more evidence to support this argument that ""programmers can't program.""  There is a lot of open source code available. There are a lot of arguments online about efficiency in code, simple topics, advanced subjects.   There are also an enormous amount of computer science graduates who will tell you upfront- ""I would never hire most of my peers to program for me."" Horror stories will abound of graduates who could barely figure out how to turn their computers on. This isn't an exaggeration.  Most CS students, when confronted with the idea that most CS students are highly incompetent even near graduation, will- for the most part- deny this is a real problem. You want to know WHY? Because incompetent people can't identify their incompetence, or the incompetence or COMPETENCE of others. They will see everyone as equals. Meanwhile, just as Dunning-Kruger suggests, the very few competent students will be fully aware of their peer's incompetence, and the mistakes they will make is to believe they are more competent than they appear. So they who say ""I would never hire most."" are probably incorrect, and would instead state ""I would never hire nearly all."" or ""I would not only never hire most, but go out of my way to make sure other's don't."" Whatever the next level of ""They are incompetent"" is.  I would however be willing to tone down my ""Most programmers"" to ""Many programmers"" or even ""Some programmers"" if someone had sufficient evidence to suggest the various levels of competence. Perhaps by sampling a large amount of open source code, and then having an expert(s) analyze their competence on a scale- to determine what % have no clue compared to what % are competent enough but not expert, or are obviously experts. This probably wouldn't be very hard- would just take the time to do such research. Perhaps develop some criteria to determine such competence to scale (No commenting at all, -5 pts, Sparse commenting, 0 pts, Expert commenting +5 pts, etc.).  I'd be willing to concede the level of incompetence of others.  Also, I am most likely myself to underestimate the incompetence of others. I am no expert myself, although I am competent enough to solve most problems- so I can only identify people who have no clue or are very newbie. I can't differentiate between expert code- so I would assume they are all competent. It's the safest assumption.  I don't have all too much experience personally reading through hundreds of other's code (who does besides a career person or expert?). However, I base my opinions from all the articles, professional programmers I talk to, and comments I read online (from expert-level users to people of questionable opinion)."
starterpacks,2xnt6d,RJAG,-1,Tue Mar 10 03:52:17 2015 UTC,"Also, the original blog handles (and defeats) Shelley's argument.  Shelley argues that programmers CAN program, even if applicants can't. That all the good programmers already have jobs.  Joel's blog, in the beginning text, covers this argument by discussing the logic:   I hear this from almost every software company. ""We hire the top 1% or less,"" they all say. Could they all be hiring the top 1%? Where are all the other 99%? General Motors?   Although eh goes on to argue something similar to Shelley (that the best programmers never apply for more than 1-2 jobs in their entire lives which is simply false in a society where job retention is shorter than ever. His two personal examples of ""people he knew"" are certainly not a good sampling of people in general).  They, like you, read very well. They just make different conclusions than you. More obvious conclusions. Obvious to them, at least. Much less obvious to Shelley or Josh.(That's my argument anyway. End Debate Turn #2.)"

starterpacks,2xnt6d,RJAG,11,Mon Mar 2 20:39:53 2015 UTC,"Stop using blender and learn real software   Blender is real software...  Also, you act as if other software (ex. 3DSMazx) is more untuitive. It's all pretty complicated and unintuitive for the newbie. You just have to learn.   Stop watching extra credits; it's not actually ""teaching"" you anything.   While I've only seen one episode (I think...) this can't be true that it is teaching nothing. At best, it teaches some things. At worst, it misinforms people by teaching them wrong info.   Make at least some progress in anything other than unity   This is great advice. The moment I stopped using Unity years ago and went through a few ""make a game from scratch"" tutorials/books, I actually progressed significantly. Unity hurts people who want to learn to be game programmers.   If you still feel like making games at that point then you might have a chance   Making games is fun, even when it's hard. It's just really hard."

Languages are pretty much the same, but all are useless if you don't understand basic programming concepts. Honestly, you don't really ""learn languages"" when you learn to program. You learn to program. Each language only differs in some areas or concepts, and syntax (ex. managed languages like C# compared to C++ have differences- but understanding OOP is more important than understanding the nuances of C++/C#.) Most concepts are universal, or at the very least help you to understand what is going on. (ex. While C++ uses pointers, so that won't help learn pointers in C# since that is a managed language, but it will still make you a better programmer, more easily learning other concepts).

When you're on a cramped rigboat, filled with people you met on the Day 1 safety meeting, for 24 hrs/day, for up to a week, there's no room to be a douchenozzle. Likewise for inland jobs - half the time you are stuck in the middle of some damn swamp or the desert."

Reddit makes a very big deal about it, even though it's considered a minor social issue at large. Politicians don't regularly give speechs about their thoughts on trans rights.

starterpacks,2xinjd,RalphWaldoNeverson,-2,Sun Mar 1 15:31:57 2015 UTC,It's become its own genre though.  It's usually a catch all term for big room house and pop dance; at least amongst dance music circles.

starterpacks,2xhmlo,epicblob,4,Sun Mar 1 06:12:47 2015 UTC,"Trust me, the music you're thinking of is emo is not emo. Emotive hardcore started off as a offshoot of hardcore punk, and it's been around since the mid 1980s and actually has been in a somewhat ""emo revival"" for the past several years. The Rites of Spring and Embrace in the 80s, Cursive, American Football, Drive Like Jehu, Fugazi, Jawbreaker and Sunny Day Real Estate in the 90s, Brand New, Saves The Day, The Promise Ring, Taking Back Sunday and Jimmy Eat World in the 2000s, and Tigers Jaw, A Great Big Pile of Leaves, Modern Baseball, Title Fight, Touche Amore, The World Is A Beautiful Place and Into It Over It for the 2010s; it's a long lived and pretty varied subgenre of punk music, and for the most part it's been consistently great music.  Post-hardcore is a whole other story. At The Drive In, anyone?"

But if you would take recommendations, I STRONGLY recommend Pantera, Slayer, Metallica's first three albums (the obvious choices), Crowbar (I'd say Crowbar is debatably the heaviest band in existence), Eyehategod (the most abrasive music you will ever hear with an unmatched vocal style), and I could go on forever.

starterpacks,2nx74m,NewW0rld,1 point,Fri Mar 27 18:24:49 2015 UTC,"Fashion:       Fashion is a popular style or practice, especially in clothing, footwear, accessories, makeup, body piercing, or furniture. Fashion is a distinctive and often habitual trend in the style in which a person dresses. It is the prevailing styles in behaviour and the newest creations of textile designers.  Because the more technical term costume is regularly linked to the term ""fashion"", the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like fancy dress or masquerade wear, while ""fashion"" generally means clothing, including the study of it. Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine, some trends are androgynous.      Image i - In Following the Fashion (1794), James Gillray caricatured a figure flattered by the short-bodiced gowns then in fashion, contrasting it with an imitator whose figure is not flattered.

If in your heart you feel a unity with the squared-toe shoes then follow your dreams and the fashion police can suck a dick. But if they're this square, you've gone too far.
