devils,3e3xwj,bringmethefunk,5,Tue Jul 21 19:41:35 2015 UTC,"Kinda have to agree with this article and the grades given. We're taking the right steps, but it's not like we're killin' it. Maybe I'd give a B and two C+'s, but that's about it. We're doing slightly better than average in terms of offseason moves. We're not killin it, but we're not making any mistakes or doing anything wrong. Best with what we've got."
devils,3e3xwj,mudclog,5,Tue Jul 21 20:54:52 2015 UTC,"First let me say I hope we win the f**king cup every single year.  But...  Short answer: It's going to be another long tough season and we'll probably draft in the top 10 again next year.    Long answer: It's been a few years coming that the changes in management and personal needed to be improved.  I LOVE Lou, but the roster over the past few years was a band aid solution.  Lou was dealt a very tough hand w Kovy and ZP moving on.  But what really hurt the organization was the lack of depth in the minors--at least from a forward position.  On D we have good young talent and we should be fine on D and in goal w Cory.    On O, we lack the superstar or game changer.  You can chalk that up to drafting in the middle or end of the draft for years, but at the same time, no one we've really drafted (again on O) has set himself a part as the next superstar of the team and that does hurt.  Teams need that player they can count on to take over a game.  With that being said, I think we have some players that will help us down the road, I.E.: Zacha, Quineville (sp?), Blandisi.  In addition to having AH, Cammy and now Pal, (which is a good start) what remains to be seen is if guys like Matteau and Boucher can take the next step and become contributors. If we can have younger guys step up, get into a rhythm, find chemistry put up some points and create a foundation, then again pick up another top 10 pick, the future could be pretty damn good.   Just is going to take some time."
devils,3e3xwj,DudeFalcone,2,Tue Jul 21 21:06:32 2015 UTC,"I just don't really see how we get a C for the future, unless by 'future' he means the next 10 months. How can we really begin to predict anything until:  _We see what happens when we completely change our entire system  _We see what happens with some of these youngins when they get shoved out on the ice and start learning that new system  _We see what happens at the end of next year when we drop some of this old baggage we still have laying around (Zubrus, if no one else)  _We see if Elias retires at the end of this year (I think his contract ends, right? someone fact check me)  _We see what (if any) trades get made once the season gets going  ...  I feel like there are at least a couple more I should add to that, but ya'll get my point. I'm not saying we have a chance to suddenly become superstars, but that seems like an unfair outlook when so many things are changing for us."

""Palmieri only scored 14 goals last season so he's not going to be the answer for the Devils' offensive problems."" Sure. that's true on the surface but uh, you realize he was playing 3rd line minutes (12 mins, usually) on the Ducks? Anyone with a pulse has been saying that Palmieri is probably closer to a 20-25 goal scorer if he was playing top 6 minutes, which he undoubtedly will be in NJ.   In the ""future"" section, the guy doesn't even mention our most standout prospect, Steve Santini.   I'm all for being realistic about our current situation, we probably aren't making the playoffs (barring a Calgary Flames-eqsue type surprise)...but at least do your research before you write somtehing like this."

devils,3dwdte,thethinglonger,17,Mon Jul 20 02:17:12 2015 UTC,"I figured here would be an opportune time to do a quick write-up on Wood, since I want to wait to see him play at BC next year before doing anything too in-depth.  Miles Wood was selected with our 4th round pick (100th overall) in 2013. He was drafted out of his prep school and was committed to Boston College for this year, however his parents wanted him to stay one more year at the prep school to finish his education there. Lou was probably extremely happy about this because of how much he likes his guys getting an education. The only issue with this is that Wood can only play 3 seasons at Boston College before becoming a UFA, as opposed to 4 seasons before he stayed for one more year at prep school. This shouldn't be a concern but with the recent prospects jumping ship like Mike Reilly (from Columbus to Minnesota) and Kevin Hayes (from Chicago to NYR), if Wood turns out to be a stud then we would want to make sure that doesn't happen.  Wood was also selected to play for Team USA at the World Junior championship, which is incredible for a high school league player. He beat out some tough competition for that spot. He didn't score any points in his 5 games played, but he was brought in to fulfill a role, in my opinion. He did not look out of place while on the ice.  As for Wood's game style, he's a strong power-forward type player with good hands and a good drive to the net. He's got a good shot and was the best player in his USHS league during his draft year, and scored at an even higher PPG rate this season, despite missing a good chunk of the season from World Junior Championship and other happenings (no major injury or suspension...just not too sure).  For those of you who were at the scrimmage or the 3-on-3 tournament, or have seen some videos of it, you could see that Wood did a really good job there. I think he could 2 goals in the 3-on-3 tournament and got 2 assists during the scrimmage. I think what's intriguing about Wood is that he has some tremendous raw tools. It's all about whether or not he can put them all together or not; we will see how he does in his first year at BC.   If he does hit his potential, he will be a Top-6 left winger. For what it's worth, he plays bigger than his size suggests, and he's already a big dude (6'1"" 185lbs). He has the potential to be a stud, but he also has the potential to be ordinary. If he doesn't put his offensive tools together then I think the potential to be a bottom 6 winger is still there as well.   He's one of the guys I'm looking most forward to following."

devils,3dtc01,pateyhfx,5,Sun Jul 19 18:07:57 2015 UTC,That was some pretty bad defence tbh. Smart pass by Zacha though.
devils,3dtc01,pcloadletter92,5,Sun Jul 19 17:04:06 2015 UTC,"43 was offside, but nice play."
devils,3dtc01,Alamoth,2,Sun Jul 19 07:38:58 2015 UTC,Training camp for the refs too ;)
devils,3dtc01,dooit,2,Mon Jul 20 14:31:48 2015 UTC,Honestly while Zacha does keep the puck the pass wasn't the greatest. Also the screen in front was perfect.
devils,3dtc01,Reeding,2,Sun Jul 19 13:34:53 2015 UTC,Yes but the player screening in front had time to get there/minimal coverage because Zach held onto the puck for so long and attracted four defenders to him. Hockey truly is a great team sport.
devils,3dtc01,uzi716,2,Sun Jul 19 14:57:57 2015 UTC,"For sure but after going through an entire season where defensemen missed the net with their shot or hit post, its nice to see one can still shoot accurately."
devils,3dtc01,KovalSNIPE17,3,Sun Jul 19 15:43:24 2015 UTC,"Good skill but that was some pretty bad defense. I reckon an NHL defenseman would have trouble stripping thay puck. It is nice to see Zacha showing some flair, haven't seen a lot of that since Kovy left."

devils,3du2oc,AntiMatter89,4,Sun Jul 19 14:08:32 2015 UTC,Still have until August 18th but I wonder why Shero would not sign him by July 15th? Agent got greedy on bonuses?
devils,3du2oc,SeniorSophomore,3,Sun Jul 19 14:23:32 2015 UTC,I don't see an issue really. I think he wants to see how much he will improve in Sarnia and then sign him.
devils,3du2oc,SeniorSophomore,2,Sun Jul 19 15:28:11 2015 UTC,"I agree, not really an issue. Just more of curiosity. If Shero is willing to throw away 100K, why? Also, are we the only team not to sign our 1st rounder in the top 10?"

devils,3drkf9,VasiliiZaytsev,7,Sat Jul 18 19:46:22 2015 UTC,My boy. I wanna see him playing this year
devils,3drkf9,Clarkson23,4,Sat Jul 18 20:53:53 2015 UTC,Definitely. We definitely have a few guys that could bring that much needed physicality to the team.  I know we are supposed to become a speedy team and what not but that doesn't mean we can't play strong devils defensive hockey with big time physicality.

devils,3drkf9,TweetPoster,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:46:59 2015 UTC,What's the difference between a 2 way and a 1 way contract?
devils,3drkf9,dlstove,3,Sat Jul 18 19:48:49 2015 UTC,Difference in pay rates. On a two way contract you make say 1 million a year in the NHL but only say 250k in the AHL. With a 1 way you make the same no matter what.
devils,3drkf9,young89er,3,Sat Jul 18 19:50:53 2015 UTC,"I believe the AHL's maximum salary is significantly less than that - $105 000, maybe? I can't recall, but Helgeson's deal pays him only $75k if he plays in the AHL next season.  Blame the NHL video games for causing everyone to think that two-way contracts mean a player doesn't have to go through waivers."
devils,3drkf9,DiscipleofGrohl,2,Sat Jul 18 19:53:07 2015 UTC,Yeah the NHL games totally screwed up my understanding of the waiver process

Really cool to see all these guys play. Thanks to you guys here on the subreddit, especially /u/thethinglonger, I was pretty familiar with most of them and knew them fairly well.   I figured I'd take some photos so you guys could get an idea of what it was like. Unfortunately I only have my phone, so the photos aren't great.  ALSO - to supplement my mediocre pictures, the Devils just posted two videos from today - one highlights video of the game and another of the post-game shootout (the game didn't end tied, it wasn't even close. they just did it to showcase the prospects skills)."

His hits would be nhl caliber. The last thing we need is him getting trained to go easier on players because he will get punished if he hits too hard.

The timing and the means by which the Swift Current Broncos officially lost Julius Honka to the Dallas Stars organization goes beyond the typical breaks of the major junior game, though. Since Honka was ruled to be on loan while he played with the Western Hockey League team last season, that exempts him from the NHL-Canadian Hockey League agreement that forbids a draft pick from a Canadian junior team from playing in the minors full-time before his 20-year-old season.   Exact situation that Zacha is in. I am 100% positive he can play in the AHL if we pay the 100k"

devils,3dn99r,DevsMetsGmen,3,Sat Jul 18 15:41:14 2015 UTC,"I really wish he had skipped this coming year. He'd be as old as Larsson was in his second season, it's not like he'd be completely overwhelmed. The pessimist in me says all he can really do in BC for another year is potentially get hurt."
devils,3dn99r,AnneFrankSimulator14,3,Fri Jul 17 20:20:59 2015 UTC,"Well Santini is enrolled in BC's Business Management program, which is actually useful compared to the random crap other NCAA athletes are in (i.e. Eichel was in a Bachelor College of General Studies, it's as useless as it sounds it's still pretty fucking useless).  I wouldn't be surprised if Santini just wants to secure a future outside of hockey. His wrist injury might have also given him some thoughts of a contingency plan if he ever got a career-ending injury."
devils,3dn99r,MatthewWickerbasket,2,Sat Jul 18 02:53:25 2015 UTC,"I love it. I wonder if he saw what happened to Jack Johnson and thought a solid degree could help in that God-forbid situation. If anything it speaks to foresight. Good for him, I wish him the best at BC and can't wait for him to hopefully take the NHL by storm."
devils,3dn99r,AnneFrankSimulator14,2,Sat Jul 18 03:57:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Jack Johnson is a good example. At the very least, business programs will teach basic finance concepts and should be very useful when Santini is making millions and will know how to intelligently manage his assets so he and his family will be set decades after his retirement.  Fun fact: Chara is probably one of the most well-prepared players for post-hockey life in the entire league. After he got traded from the Islanders to the Senators, Chara went to Algonquin College in Ottawa part-time (while playing in the NHL full time) and dedicated his free time to complete a degree in financial planning. Also during his life, he learned seven languages; Slovak, Czech, Polish, Swedish, Russian, German, and English (which will be incredibly useful in a lot EU business sectors). Also, earlier this year, he obtained a real estate license for Massachusetts.   For the last decade plus, Chara has been doing an incredible job of preparing his resume post-retirement. Pro-athletes are pretty notorious for going bankrupt very shortly after retirement. Chara will definitely not be one of them."
devils,3dn99r,quantum_monster,2,Sat Jul 18 04:44:40 2015 UTC,"There's no Bachelor of General Studies. Students at BU's College of General Studies (CGS) are there for two years then transfer into one of the other schools' degree programs. I still agree that NCAA athletes tend to have eh majors, but I just saw this and felt like jumping in."
devils,3dn99r,AnneFrankSimulator14,2,Sat Jul 18 04:14:31 2015 UTC,"Whoops my bad, was looking at BU's profile on Eichel and I just read ""Enrolled in the College of General Studies"", thought ""what the fuck is that"". Ended up reading about ""Bachelor of General Studies"" instead, thinking they were they same thing. Thanks for clearing that up."
devils,3dn99r,quantum_monster,2,Sat Jul 18 04:24:32 2015 UTC,"Haha no worries. It is still pretty dumb to be honest. The stereotype of that college is that it's for students who got into BU because of their rich parents and not by their grades. One joke is that CGS stands for Crayons, Glue, Scissors. So yeah, Eichel chose that college for a very good reason since he was pretty much guaranteed a professional contract."
devils,3dn99r,chickenKsadilla,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:41:32 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty insulting stereotype. My sister used CGS at BU as a way to explore majors because she was undecided about what she wanted to do. It's not ""pretty dumb"" as you said and it's not ""pretty fucking useless"" as /u/AnneFrankSimulator14 said. It saved her from committing to a major too early and falling behind. When she found what she loved, she declared her major and was able to pursue that degree with confidence. We have a similar college at my university and it was the best thing I ever did and is a fantastic resource for students who are unsure about their passion during their freshman and sophomore years.   Sorry to deviate from hockey talk, but I felt this was necessary to clarify."
devils,3dn99r,quantum_monster,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:19:03 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I meant the way it is sometimes used is pretty dumb (though my comment certainly doesn't read like that...). As I said, it's a stereotype, not necessarily true. I'm a tour guide so I know what it's meant for (finding what you want to do) and how many students use it. However, I'm sure that's not what Eichel and some students use it for. I didn't mean to be insulting, just trying to explain how it's used by some."
devils,3dn99r,AnneFrankSimulator14,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:38:57 2015 UTC,"I got to apologize as well. When I said it was useless, I meant it specifically for Eichel and others like him. It's obviously useful as a stepping stone (like your sister) but if it's your final destination in your academic career, it's really not worth much. I'm sure it's a fantastic resource for students that have aspirations past it but for NCAA players like Eichel it is pretty fucking useless.  Sure, it's not uncommon for NHLers to complete some schooling in their spare time away from the ice but I can't see how CGS would really affect an NHLer in anyway since they're already pursuing degrees several years past the norm. If I understand it, the CGS is useful for 'delaying' commitment while still keeping up with one's education. If that's true, an NHLer already has all the time in the world to not even need that."
devils,3dn99r,DevsMetsGmen,2,Sun Jul 19 17:49:15 2015 UTC,"As a former RPI student, it's funny to see that the BC students in the Management program are the serious ones.  I think this comes down more to hubrus than foresight, though. I'm not holding it against him, but this strikes me as a decision made based on the injury and leaving ""unfinished business."" Many athletes complete degrees part time after leaving school early, and even if you manage to play until 40 that's still young enough to complete a degree and forge a second career, not that you'd have to at that point.  Overall, as good as he will be, I think the Devils always take a hands off approach to these things, and I think with the Larsson comparison I made it should just remind us of how far ahead of the curve Adam is as we move into what could be a breakthrough year for him."

When I was in tryouts for Junior A all the goalies were like ""You dont want to make the highlight reel. You dont want the coach to see you make a big save because the better goalie wouldnt have needed to""  but somehow I was a forward and ended up being the 1 on a 3 on 1 so that team may not know what they were talking about"

devils,3dm5qm,ball_blam_burglerber,7,Fri Jul 17 11:45:39 2015 UTC,Thought he looked decent last year. Hopefully he can put up something like 30 points in his rookie season
devils,3dm5qm,Clarkson23,9,Fri Jul 17 14:18:03 2015 UTC,Hey as much as I would like to see that I doubt it. But one thing I would like to see him continue doing is hitting. I remember towards last year in the lineup he was the only visible forward putting the body and was the reason actually why he scored last season. He hit Subban on the forecheck. Puck went back to the point and he got the rebound.
devils,3dm5qm,NYDevilsFan,4,Fri Jul 17 15:25:48 2015 UTC,30 points would make me super happy. Obviously it's a lot to ask but ya never know what a guy like Hynes could get out of a young player

devils,3dm5qm,mudclog,5,Fri Jul 17 12:33:01 2015 UTC,Seems like there is a lot of negativity towards matteau in this sub.  Do people really expect him to be garbage?
devils,3dm5qm,AntiMatter89,3,Fri Jul 17 14:48:55 2015 UTC,"I hold no distaste for him, but I can understand where it comes from.  Hindsight is 20/20, and keeping the pick that we used to get Matteau was definitely the wrong choice. But again, you can't predict the future and I agree with the mindset at the time that they kept the pick.   I think he'll pan out to be a bottom 6 forward at best."
devils,3dm5qm,InterestingKiwi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:38:23 2015 UTC,I wasn't following the draft picks and such at that point. What was the deal with his pick? You mentioned keeping it over picking him?
devils,3dm5qm,AntiMatter89,3,Fri Jul 17 15:59:51 2015 UTC,"As part of the whole kovalchuk contract fiasco, we were forced to give up a first round pick, but could choose to do so in any of three years. Since we had the 29th pick that year, everyone thought Lou would forfeit it, as odds are that would be the ""worst"" first rounder we'd have within our window to forfeit one. Lou kept the pick, and drafted Matthieu. Of course, we ended up never having to forfeit a pick, as we were granted the 30th pick two years ago (but lost our original draft position). If Lou knew this was going to happen, the Matthieu pick made sense. If he just go lucky, the logic doesn't really add up."
devils,3dm5qm,DaveKillerCarlson,3,Fri Jul 17 16:25:17 2015 UTC,Even still I may have rather had the #9 pick two years ago over Matteau and quenneville

devils,3dm5qm,AntiMatter89,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:26:09 2015 UTC,I don't see how not using the pick would have benefited the Devils. They appealed and didn't have drop a pick and got a forward prospect out of it
devils,3dm5qm,FilmNerdasaurus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:36:12 2015 UTC,"The argument would be that while they kept their pick, they lost considerable draft position in the year the league compromised with them. Lou's argument was he'd wait it out regardless of what pick was lost in the end because he'd rather have a ""lesser"" prospect with more experience than give up the time to cultivate a pick."
devils,3dm5qm,DevsMetsGmen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:12:00 2015 UTC,We ended up with a 30th overall pick instead of our normal pick though.
devils,3dm5qm,InterestingKiwi,0,Fri Jul 17 19:23:42 2015 UTC,"The question is whether or not Matteau + Quenneville end up being better than who we might have picked at #11 last year. If we'd forfeited the pick in 2012, we'd have picked #11 last year instead of #30."
devils,3dm5qm,VasiliiZaytsev,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:28:56 2015 UTC,"The thing is, that has nothing to do with Matteau. He was picked... why take the circumstances of his selection out on him?"

If they had given up their pick in 2012, they'd have lost Matteau, but the Quenneville pick would have been 11th overall instead, allowing them to potentially get a much better prospect than either Matteau or Quenneville."

devils,3dm5qm,NYDevilsFan,7,Fri Jul 17 15:03:22 2015 UTC,Better than putting out old veterans on the wrong side of 30.

devils,3dm5qm,TweetPoster,3,Fri Jul 17 15:53:18 2015 UTC,"Matteau has played well for the most part when among his age group, and although he didn't set the AHL on fire his being a plus player tells me that he must have been competitive against many older and more experienced veterans.  I feel like the new regime is hoping for him, Boucher, Zacha, et al to give them a reason to keep him on the squad after the pre-season is over. He might have the best chance of all of them because he can fill a bottom six role without stunting his development."

devils,3dnqez,fartswhenhappy,11,Fri Jul 17 19:35:13 2015 UTC,"good player, but would I put him in the same regard as the players in the rafter? No.   Had a rough exit and well his coaching stint didn't help. If his number was going to be retired it would have happen before Stevens."
devils,3dnqez,FilmNerdasaurus,5,Fri Jul 17 19:58:56 2015 UTC,"would I put him in the same regard as the players in the rafter? No.   I mostly agree with that.    Of course it's entirely subjective, but I'd probably rank the all-time Devils hierarchy -- based on a combination of pure talent and importance to the team -- something like this:    Level 1: Brodeur & Stevens Level 2: Daneyko Level 3: Elias Level 4: Niedermayer & MacLean Level 5: Driver, Lemieux, Parise Level 6: Resch, Muller, Fetisov, Holik Level 7: Brylin Level 8: Aaron Broten, Verbeek, Sykora, Madden Level 9: Burke, Sundstrom, Gomez, Rafalski Level 10: Stastny, Pandolfo, Gionta, Langenbrunner, Zajac, Greene, Kovalchuk    Wow, I spent way more time on that than I originally intended. Anyway, I think Mac is pretty much on Nieds' level, but not on the same level as Marty, Stevens, Dano, or Patty."
devils,3dnqez,babrooks213,2,Sat Jul 18 06:01:43 2015 UTC,"I would put Niedermayer at Level 1. He was an otherworldly talent, and probably the best defenseman we've ever had. Yes, better than Stevens. Stevens was probably the best Devil, or second best after Marty, because he was an amazing defenseman but also a leader. But in terms of pure talent, Niedermayer was better.  Quick edit: I'd also add that I'd put MacLean on the same level as Driver, Lemieux, and Parise"
devils,3dnqez,MrSloppyPants,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:00:44 2015 UTC,"I think Niedermayer might've been the most purely talented player to ever wear the sweater, or at least tied with Brodeur. But Marty rewrote the record books and the rule book while here, and was the backbone of each Cup team. Stevens was the captain, could kill a man with a single look, and won a Conn Smythe with pure badassery. As great as Niedermayer was, I just can't put him on that level. As a player overall? Maybe. As a Devil? Can't do it. If he had stayed instead of going to Anaheim and had a nice run as captain, that'd be a whole other story."
devils,3dnqez,davegarri,2,Sat Jul 18 21:24:13 2015 UTC,In what reality is Niedermayer not a Level 1? Three cups with NJ (The team that drafted him) and probably the best pure skater that's ever played the game.
devils,3dnqez,MrSloppyPants,7,Sat Jul 18 14:12:27 2015 UTC,I'd rather see Brylin get his name up there. He was such an underrated and under-appreciated player for this franchise. Once Brodeur is inevitably up there Brylin will be the only player to have won all three cups to not have his number retired.   We need to show Sarge some respect!

devils,3dn7ra,charmander4281,5,Fri Jul 17 17:17:12 2015 UTC,"If we're going to shift out guys like Zubrus and Ruutu then I want draft picks back in return, at least third-round picks. Otherwise I'd rather our young guys get a chance to learn from these veterans before they ride off into the sunset or sign one-year deals with the Avalanche, whatever it is terrible veterans do these days."
devils,3dn7ra,Alamoth,2,Fri Jul 17 17:42:55 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'd like to go out on a limb and say lets package a defensive prospect or two with them. We have a crap load of prospects plus signing Moore, and a few guys from Europe didn't help the transition unless we are going to be bringing up players and sending them back a few times this season."
devils,3dn7ra,mattisonholdatwork,2,Fri Jul 17 17:53:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not concerned about our extra defensemen to be honest. You've essentially got four skaters who are locks for an NHL position and five skaters competing for those last two spots in the lineup. If one of those extra guys is a 7th-defender who fills in for injuries and the other two are your top pairing in Albany then what's the problem?  Everyone is quick to ship out a young defender but please recall that players get injured and Lars, Gelly, Merrill, and Severson have all spent significant time injured. It's a boon to have a bunch of promising young talent to bring in to fill in the space when they're hurt.  So for now I would stay put. Next year Merrill will be due for a new contract and who knows what will happen with Gelinas and so on. Maybe Santini goes pro next year and makes the team. So much can change, but right now I don't think Shero should be in any kind of rush to move any of our young blue-liners."
devils,3dn7ra,Alamoth,2,Fri Jul 17 17:56:49 2015 UTC,"Larsson had mumps, not really an injury. But I agree, I think they need to wait it out, see how they all develop, then start shipping guys out in 1-3 years."
devils,3dn7ra,The_Friedberger,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:01:04 2015 UTC,Lars missed plenty of time before last season
devils,3dn7ra,Alamoth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:06:45 2015 UTC,"I thought you were referring to last year, as that's when we had a lot of injuries amongst our defense. He was also scratched for significant amount of time over his first 3 years, mostly the second and third season. But he was also injured and then sent to the minors."
devils,3dn7ra,The_Friedberger,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:27:25 2015 UTC,"Almost all of his time missed under the DeBoer era was because of benching, not injury. He had a lower back injury back in 2012 (I think it was a bruise), but other than the mumps I can't think of any other significant time he's missed because of injury."
devils,3dn7ra,ChrisKerrigan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:29:52 2015 UTC,"Back injury in 2012, Lower-Body injury in 2014, Mumps in 2015. Yes, he was benched a lot, but he's also missed a decent amount of time to injury/illness.  My point is just that things happen to players all the time. Having seven or eight NHL-caliber defenders under the age of 25 is a wonderful problem to have."
devils,3dn7ra,Alamoth,2,Fri Jul 17 20:56:49 2015 UTC,"I get you're trying to start a conversation but I think you're off in what could happen.  As much as I'd like Zacha to be in our line up opening night, I just think he's going back to jr's.    And moving Zubs or Ruutu I highly doubt is going to happen. Neither would warrant anything and their contracts are HUGE.  The only way Zubs or Ruutu would/could be moved is for a team to be at the cap floor and they need that contract to hit it.  My guess is we're stuck w both until the season's over.  And to move a guy on D like Merrill--I can't see happening unless a team had a major Dman go down and they needed to fill a hole asap.    Overall I do not see us making any real trades any time soon at least based on trying to fill a hole.  The D is set and all younger forwards will be given a shot to make the line up.  There are basically 2 open spots and 1 semi open spot.  2 will be filled by Matteau and Boucher.  The last one (Gio/Ruutu/Tootoo's spot) could be taken over by a guy like Blake Coleman.  Patty, Zubs, Ruutu all come off the books next year.  I'd foresee more moves happening a year from now when there are more openings vs this season."
devils,3dn7ra,DudeFalcone,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:29:46 2015 UTC,Mattaeu will be in the lineup. I think we need a top rw guy but we don't have the chips to get one.

We're alright for now, the people we would be willing to trade (Gelinas or Zubrus) are either not as highly valued as we would like them to be, or have a contract too big to be valuable to another team. That is, unless they are scraping the cap floor and have an abundance of picks.   I say we're good. One more year, maybe next year make a big trade for a first line forward, and we're ready to compete."

devils,3dh0mi,natefaraci,9,Thu Jul 16 05:12:10 2015 UTC,"I'd put Elias over Dano, but I could see an argument for Dano too."
devils,3dh0mi,romple,5,Thu Jul 16 05:23:41 2015 UTC,Elias has to be in over Dano. As much as Kenny was a huge part of the Devils success and the total embodiment of the team spirit you can't leave out the team's all time leading scorer who's literally played every game of his long career there.
devils,3dh0mi,wewillrise420,-7,Thu Jul 16 13:10:48 2015 UTC,"LOL, if your reasoning for Elias over Dano is that he's 'literally played every game of his long career here', then you've failed miserably.  Dano played parts of 20 NHL seasons, only for the Devils.  Elias, including this coming season, will have played parts of 20 NHL seasons, only for the Devils.  Daneyko NHL GP- 1283 Elias NHL GP- 1224  On the assumption that this could be Patty's last year, and he'll play all 82 games (highly unlikely), he'll have played the same number of seasons as Danekyo, and played a whole 23 more games, which again, will probably not be 23, since he's older and won't last a full 82.  Daneyko was just as important, arguably more so, to this organization than Elias, and the only grounds for Elias over him is that he's their all-time leading scorer, which, let's be real, playing 20 seasons with the same team will do that for ya as a skilled forward.  Not saying you're wrong, you can probably flip a coin on the two, but Elias doesn't get it for having played a lengthy career all as a Devil.  Dano was the King of that."

devils,3dh0mi,rabid_android,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:20:50 2015 UTC,Is #15 hanging from the Prudential Center Rafters?  Johnny Mac was really one knee injury away from being top 4 all time for this franchise.  Wasn't the same player after he lost the season to the knee injury.  Then he was traded and eventually played for the Rangers before coming back and putting on one of the worst headcoaching performances in Devils history.
devils,3dh0mi,fartswhenhappy,3,Thu Jul 16 14:24:38 2015 UTC,"People still hold Mac's time in New York against him? And I'm not sure what his coaching stint has to do with his importance as a Devils player. But if we're gonna go nitpicking for transgressions, let's not forget that Niedermayer was basically handed the reigns of the team -- given the captaincy and offered the league max contract -- and he went to Anaheim instead. Not that I hold it against him (anymore), but that was his chance to carry the team on his back. Instead he carried the Ducks.    Look, Niedermayer was an amazing player. A generational talent. Watching him skate was poetry in motion. But, with the exception of the second half of the '03-04 season, he was always the third-best Devil behind Brodeur and Stevens. He never carried the team because, well, he never had to. The best case one can make is his playoff performance in '03 when he arguably should've won the Conn Smythe. But then again, Brodeur broke the league record for shutouts in a postseason and Langenbrunner had just as many points while also potting more game-winners than Nieds had goals.    MacLean carried the load in the lean years. He's the only Devil to score more than 40 goals three times. Hell, he's the only one to do it twice! And if you add up all of Niedermayer's individual moments, they don't equal the importance of MacLean's '88 goal in Chicago.    MacLean led the Devils in goals four times and in points twice. Niedermayer only ever led the team in assists once. While it's not entirely fair to judge a forward against a defenseman using scoring as the metric, I think it's fair here considering that Nieds is #2 in all-time Devils assists.    And FWIW, I think it's a crime that #15 isn't hanging from the rafters. Hopefully it will one day.    Edit: About that knee injury ... two of those four seasons Mac led the team in goals were post-injury, including his last full season here."
devils,3dh0mi,Rdoll17,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:06:38 2015 UTC,Neids wanted to play and win a cup with his brother and that's why he left. He went to Anaheim not a big deal. Johnny Mac went for $$$ and went to the shittiest organization in sports history the fuckboys of New York. Also he's a ween.
devils,3dh0mi,fartswhenhappy,2,Fri Jul 17 05:49:30 2015 UTC,Or it was because he still lived in New Jersey and the Rangers were the closest team to home to offer him a contract.
devils,3dh0mi,Rdoll17,0,Fri Jul 17 11:57:13 2015 UTC,All I'm saying is there's a reason his name isn't hanging from the rafters.

I really liked seeing that he really knows how to lay his ass out (reminded me of Jagr) to protect the puck. If the kid puts on some muscle weight, and does Jagr leg works outs, hes going to be something really special for our program. Just watching his shot, it was just so smooth, quick, and hard. Really awesome. If he adjusts the the NA rink size sooner rather than later, he will make an impact for us in the big club for sure.   Tyler Kelleher looked amazing. He was the most impressive that i saw today. Kid was all over the ice, fast, great hands, and could sure bury the puck. He is small, 5'6, and obviously this wasnt full contact but it was sure nice to see him play. Who knows, maybe we could getlucky one day and the kid ends up like Brian Gionta as an undersized guy that can still score. Longshot, but would be nice.  Blackwood was on point. He looked great all day and had some amazing saves. Glad we drafted him because he was easily the best goalie out there today.   Other guys that impressed me- Shea, Speers, and Scarlet. All looked good, quick hands, and nice shots.   All in all it was awesome to be there today, got some Dino BBQ after get poured on while heading there. Saw Dano, Chere, TG all there.   Also was lucky enough to show up late, and get black wristbands. Ended up with 6 free tickets between the 3 of us that went for a game in Oct. Pretty kick-ass experience today."

devils,3dae3i,uzi716,5,Tue Jul 14 19:19:23 2015 UTC,You can teach Gelinas to play better D. You can't teach anyone else to shoot like that. Love it.
devils,3dae3i,NS24,5,Wed Jul 15 02:13:13 2015 UTC,"Nice, let's get Larsson signed now."
devils,3dae3i,toiletting,7,Tue Jul 14 19:17:37 2015 UTC,"It'll bring him to 26 years old, so final year of RFA status. A good chance for him to improve his game and prove he should be kept here.  I'm concerned how this affects our lineup for the season now. Either means Merrill is the one who is moved, or someone is spending their days in the AHL.  Larsson - Greene  Gelinas - Merrill  Moore - Severson  With Mozik signed and Santini, Helgeson &Habrenenka in the fold too. Though, I believe Santini is going back to college, so that clears him off the board."
devils,3dae3i,snootchie_bootch,18,Tue Jul 14 19:27:52 2015 UTC,"We used over 10 defensemen last year. Having young guys in Albany who are ready to gain NHL experience is a blessing, not a curse.   Plus, we couldn't trade Gelinas until he exited arbitration, so signing him just means he can now be traded, if that's the intention"
devils,3dae3i,4raises3,5,Tue Jul 14 19:40:22 2015 UTC,"Though part of the reason we used 11 defensemen was because of injuries/illness. Salvador, Severson, Harrold all were injured at some point last season. Larsson had the mumps for a while, during which time Salvador was injured (and Severson too I think). Then you have Helgeson, who only played in 22 games, Harrold 43, and Fraser 34, so a lot of cycling through that 6th spot. Hopefully we won't find ourselves needing to use so many defenders again.  I agree that either Gelinas or Merrill will likely be traded. For what, we can only speculate."
devils,3dae3i,The_Friedberger,4,Tue Jul 14 20:06:07 2015 UTC,"I agree it's not significant NHL experience, but it's unlikely all 6 will play all 82 games -- we'd be lucky if one does. Even though I loved Helgeson and Hrabarenka on the ice last season, we don't know if they're ready to be 82 game players. 20-30 games would be ideal for either of them"
devils,3dae3i,4raises3,7,Tue Jul 14 20:22:41 2015 UTC,"Personally, I was frustrated that they gave Fraser games instead of letting Helgeson play. I though Helgeson was much better, and brought the same physicality to the game."

devils,3dae3i,The_Friedberger,5,Tue Jul 14 21:02:09 2015 UTC,"Ahhh you beat me to it. I was going to suggest that the deal might have been made to push forward with a trade. $1.575M AAV is a steal for Gelly, so maybe Ray is trying to flip him? I hope not, but it's a possibility."
devils,3dae3i,al1enworkshop,3,Tue Jul 14 19:56:03 2015 UTC,That's what I thought.
devils,3dae3i,BroodingWriter,10,Tue Jul 14 20:00:11 2015 UTC,"Santini is definitely going back to BU BC, so that's not a concern. You need at least 7 defenders, so assuming Mozik is the guy, that means Helgeson and Habrenenka go back to Albany with Scarlett and whomever else.  Having extra defenders is never a problem. Lars, Merrill, and Severson have both sat out significant amounts of time the past few years. The other guys will get their chance for sure."
devils,3dae3i,Alamoth,3,Tue Jul 14 20:13:27 2015 UTC,"Santini is BC, not BU."
devils,3dae3i,citycouncilorknope,2,Tue Jul 14 20:53:32 2015 UTC,My bad
devils,3dae3i,Alamoth,2,Tue Jul 14 20:56:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not an immediate problem now, but if for whatever reason none of them are moved it will be. Just like when we were backlogged with Larsson, Merrill and Gelinas. Only this time there aren't older veterans to vote out of the lineup. These guys are all too close in age to make the voting process easy.  Of course, I'm looking into the future a little far. It's not something to lose sleep over just yet."
devils,3dae3i,snootchie_bootch,5,Tue Jul 14 20:17:03 2015 UTC,"It's a good problem to have though, even if we have it.  If you tell me that our blue-line for the season is going to be:   Greene - Larsson Merrill - Severson Moore - Mozik/Gelinas   And that they're going to be able to play at an NHL level for 82 games. Then honestly I have no problem with Hrabarenka and Helgeson spending the season as the top pair in the AHL."
devils,3dae3i,Alamoth,2,Tue Jul 14 20:20:12 2015 UTC,I think Merril is a 3rd liner and Moore or Mozik will be 2nd line
devils,3dae3i,elliot91,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:32:25 2015 UTC,I concur.
devils,3dae3i,Hoff16,5,Wed Jul 15 14:36:33 2015 UTC,What about Scarlett?
devils,3dae3i,SeniorSophomore,3,Tue Jul 14 19:30:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not surprised I forgot someone. Makes it even more difficult.  My guess is Helgeson and Habrenenka both stay in the minors another year, but that just delays the problem further.  We have to move some of these guys."
devils,3dae3i,snootchie_bootch,3,Tue Jul 14 19:32:53 2015 UTC,"Well, Moore, Merrill, and Gelinas are all have tradeable contracts if we feel the need to move them. If we absolutely have to trade one, two, or all three, it won't be difficult since some of them still have good trade value and good contracts that won't hurt another teams cap.   And about our other defensemen, Mozik will most likely need at least a season or two down in Albany to maybe play on ice over here. One of Hrabarenka or Helgeson could be called up and used as a seventh d-man in case of someone like Moore or Merrill is injured or needs to sit out a few games. As much as I really like the way our D looks, I do agree that maybe Gelinas, Merrill, or Moore if he doesn't do well for us should be moved for a forward. But ONLY IF they are not doing well."
devils,3dae3i,SeniorSophomore,3,Tue Jul 14 19:40:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the tradeable contracts is definitely a bonus here.  I thought Mozik was on a one year deal, so I wouldn't be surprised to see him spend time between the two leagues.  I'm just saying if we don't move any of these guys, our logjam doesn't get any better. We'll just have the same situation as the past few years, with none of the guys being older players that should be sitting like Salvador, Zidlicky or Volchenkov.  But I'm sure some of them will be moved, just a matter of who and when."
devils,3dae3i,snootchie_bootch,2,Tue Jul 14 19:44:53 2015 UTC,"No chance Merrill slots in above Severson barring injury or regression. I can't see Santini making the roster unless he really impresses, it would be better for him to get top 4 minutes in the AHL anyways. Mozik and Habrenenka will definitely start the season in the AHL, Helgeson is probably the most ready to step up into the 3rd pairing/7th defenseman role"
devils,3dae3i,DashFromtheGash,3,Tue Jul 14 19:54:42 2015 UTC,Santini is staying in college
devils,3dae3i,jcort90,3,Tue Jul 14 20:29:48 2015 UTC,Great bridge deal. I think he will grow a lot this year and next and become more effective on both sides of the ice.

devils,3daru9,adixon816,3,Tue Jul 14 20:58:42 2015 UTC,Even though he had a better season I'd still like to see a 2 year deal. To me his consistency is still unproven. It would bring him 1 year from RFA and if he plays well give him the long term. But it's a double edged sword. If you give him a long deal now and it pans out then it has tremendous value over the term of the contract.
devils,3daru9,hotstickywaffle,2,Tue Jul 14 21:05:21 2015 UTC,"I don't see how this works. Either we pay him way more than he's worth now in the hopes that he eventually lives up to it (and could end up paying way to much for him if he doesn't) , or Larsson takes far less than he could potentially be worth. I don't see why they wouldn't just do a bridge deal. Am I wrong?"

devils,3da71w,SmacSBU,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:13:41 2015 UTC,What kind of seats did you pick for the opener? Ever do the concession pass? Is it worth it?
devils,3da71w,SmacSBU,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:06:55 2015 UTC,"I did two games with restaurant seats and one game with the concession pass. The concession pass is only worth it on the cheaper games because you can only go to a stand once every 15 minutes. They usually close/run out of food during the 3rd and you can only get one main, one side and one drink, every time.   Let's break it down -- I'm in ""Devils Red Attack"" for the Ranger game which is $184. The concession pass is $281 for that game. I have two tickets, so $368 (184x2) vs $562 (281x2). Can I really spend $194 (562-184) in food by going to the concession once or twice? Let's say you do get food three times. I'm just gonna say chicken fingers 3 times ($10x3, $30) and a drink every time ($5x3, $15) and fries every time ($5x3, $15) that's a total of $60 of food, per ticket, which comes out to $120 total. Is that $74 (562-368-120) worth the center ice?   How about ""concession pass defend"" -- $262 ea. -- $524 total. That'd be a $36 (524-368-120) difference, and IMO is still not worth it. I like my ""attack twice"" sections and not having an upset stomach.  I did the restaurant only for the experience (I used to have season tickets in the unlimited food/drinks 2 years ago, so I know about that already)."

Is there compensation like a RFA signing?"
devils,3d96rp,Nanojack,5,Tue Jul 14 15:29:51 2015 UTC,"No compensation, per the CBA"

This compensation does not come from the team that ends up snagging the player. (No payment required for signing UFAs.)  For example, Kevin Hayes was picked in the first round by the Blackhawks in 2010 and after four seasons at Boston College opted to wait until the Hawks rights to him expired, and signed with the Rangers the next day. The Hawks were compensated with pick #54 in the 2015 draft.    The Chicago Blackhawks received the 24th pick of this round (54th overall) as compensation for not signing 2010 first-round draft pick Kevin Hayes.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_NHL_Entry_Draft  As you can see in the link above, the second round contained 31 picks instead of the usual 30."

Taylor originally called his product “Taylor’s Prepared Ham”, but was forced to change the name after the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 was passed, since the product did not meet the new legal definition of “ham”. The new name was “Pork Roll” and it was marketed as both “Taylor’s Pork Roll” and “Trenton Pork Roll”. Competitors marketed products with similar names like “Rolled Pork” and “Trenton style Pork Roll” and were sued by Taylor. A 1910 legal case ruled that the words “Pork Roll” could not be trademarked.     TL;DR It used to be Taylor's Prepared Ham (the photo you posted is Taylor's Chopped Ham), but has been Pork Roll since 1906 when the government decided it couldn't legally be called ham.

devils,3d612z,zayas324,18,Mon Jul 13 20:17:09 2015 UTC,"For those who aren't aware, this past stretch of playoff hockey for Quenneville, playing with the Brandon Wheat Kings of the WHL, was the best I've seen him play. He was all over the ice and played in some key situations. While he was kept quiet in the championship series against Kelowna (the whole Wheat Kings team was...they got swept), Quenneville posted 19 points (10G 9A) in 19 games...a huge bounceback after a disappointing season. Quenneville himself was talking (I don't really know where the link is, but I'll keep looking) about how his season was disappointing but he was satisfied with his playoff play.  Also for those who don't know, Quenneville was named to Team Canada's summer World Junior roster, which means he will be fighting for a spot for Team Canada at the World Juniors this year (yes that's MacKenzie Blackwood, our 2nd round pick this year, there as well...he's actually being looked at and from initial reports he might just be the starting goalie for Team Canada)."

devils,3d612z,FilmNerdasaurus,3,Tue Jul 14 02:15:08 2015 UTC,So this mean he will either will be playing in Albany or in the show?
devils,3d612z,NYDevilsFan,7,Mon Jul 13 20:20:50 2015 UTC,Nope. He still has another year of WHL eligibility and cant go to albany. They likely just wanted him signed
devils,3d612z,feeleyfilms,2,Mon Jul 13 20:24:07 2015 UTC,But he can play like 7 NHL games. After that either they will burn a year of his contract if he plays more games in the NHL or he can go back to juniors right and save a year?
devils,3d612z,NYDevilsFan,2,Mon Jul 13 20:27:16 2015 UTC,He could get his 9 games in but I dont think its likely. Should be back in the WHL for another year

devils,3d4xy6,Cum_on_doorknob,9,Mon Jul 13 17:14:56 2015 UTC,"Sorry, if I remember correctly it's because he is no longer on his ELC contract. Only players still on ELC (like Severson) or who haven't signed yet can come to prospect camp.  The first year of Matteau's ELC was burned when he played 17 games in 2012-13.

devils,3d4xy6,FilmNerdasaurus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:52:48 2015 UTC,I hope we sign Appleby. I'm still amazed that he was passed up in the draft 3 years in a row. His numbers in Juniors are pretty impressive. Better than Blackwoods. I wonder what makes him less appealing. He was ranked 27th among N.A. goalies.
devils,3d4xy6,Reeding,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:43:08 2015 UTC,"There's a good article on him from NHL.com last week: http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=774279  I think his age was the main reason he wasn't drafted. He had a great season, but he was 20 years old by the time the playoffs began. That's two full years over most players in the league and over the draft-eligible age.  Also we don't have a lot of space for him on the depth chart unless we're going to shuffle him off to the ECHL or do the same to Wedgewood. I wouldn't mind seeing Wedgewood sent away to be honest, and you can never have enough goalies in the system.  Blackwood will be going back to the OHL, that much is certain. Appleby could go back, but after winning the Memorial Cup I think he's probably looking to move forward with his career."
devils,3d4xy6,KovalSNIPE17,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:08:45 2015 UTC,"I had read that, it was part of what had me excited about him coming to the Devils dev. camp. His numbers over the past two years have been pretty solid. They could just bench Danis, start Wedgewood, and have Appleby as the backup. But that'd seem harsh for Danis as we just signed him. I have faith in Shero to figure it all out."
devils,3d4xy6,Hoff16,2,Mon Jul 13 19:10:07 2015 UTC,If Appleby signs I think Wedgewood is going to be the odd man out.  Then again we can always give Danis the Brunner treatment and he can go back to Europe.

Columbus was just looking for defensive prospects and was thinking of offering their young power forward prospect, Kerby Rychel, in return.

Do we put them together and see who the best 5/6 of them are over the course of the next 3 years and trade the rest for assets?   We are still working on our forward prospects (which I think we've taken a huge step this past draft), but I think we've got one of the best young defensive cores in the league. The only real competition ,in my mind, for that spot is with Anaheim and Philadelphia."
devils,3d2q9m,rapier999,3,Mon Jul 13 03:13:06 2015 UTC,"Another terrific write-up. You seem to have a good eye for scouting hockey players. Too often bloggers get hung up on statistics and achievements, but your report includes vital information such as skating stride and hockey IQ. Keep it up!"

But at least Rangers suck, actually dates back to CAA. The additional parts evolved at The Rock.  This fan base can't hold a ""Let's go Devils"" chant if their lives depended on it, but man, throw in a ""suck"" or ""swallow"" and we never miss.  In the ""glory days"" of this team, waaaaay back in the late 90's early 00's, the fan base focused more on the Devils and not complaining about not being able to say ""you suck"" in a goal song.

But i agree that atrocity we have now has to go, but truth of the matter is nothing they do is going to satisfy everyone....I wouldn't expect any changes.

devils,3ctjh3,rphill,7,Fri Jul 10 17:51:39 2015 UTC,"People often forget that centers job is to be winning faceoffs on both ends, and playing a 2 way game.  Its tough when there are a lot of scoring centers in the game but its really not fair to judge Zajac to crosby, or kopitar.

devils,3ctjh3,happypants249,6,Fri Jul 10 18:23:33 2015 UTC,"I'm a very big Zajac fan and have been.  People on these boards give him a ton of shit and I disagree to a certain extent.  Would I love to see TZ score more?  Hell yea, I think we all would.  But until he has a solid player to feed ala Parise type, then his numbers will continue to be ehh.  And that's a tough pill to swallow for some as his contract is rather large.  And he might not be the #1 center most other teams have.  That's another tough pill to swallow, but for now, let's talk about TZ as we do have him.  I'm not going to deny Lou thru an ass load of $ at TZ and sure he might not put up the points a Toews or Backes might, but his overall game is very solid.  He positions himself well, does well on faceoffs, back checks like no other--really plays 200 ft better than anyone on the team.    I think if TZ and Cammy can find some chemistry this year or if not, put AH and Cammy back together and put TZ w Pal.  Now I don't think TZ will put up massive points just by one of those two pairings, but if he can help his linemates put up more points, create more opportunities on O, and help out the D by back checking, then you have a player most teams would love to have."
devils,3ctjh3,DudeFalcone,5,Fri Jul 10 18:34:50 2015 UTC,"The gist of it is essentially that Zajac isn't contributing very much to scoring, but when it comes to playing defense, he's one of the better centers in the league (often showing up in the top 10).  The criticisms of him not scoring enough points is valid - without Parise and Kovalchuk, he needs to put up the points.  But to dismiss him as a weak center completely overlooks the other half of his game, which puts him in very good company.  TL;DR: Great defensive center, but needs to put up more points"
devils,3ctjh3,Clarkson23,4,Fri Jul 10 17:38:42 2015 UTC,"Zajac is a great player who's only flaw is his ability to put up big offensive numbers. He needs good players around him to thrive, simple as that."

Him potting 20 goals, with Ryder contributing some good offense, combined with our good output in 2013-14 despite bad line up.  We definatly felt good. We also thought the Havlet signing was a steal for the potential upside it could be. Unfortunatly non of it panned out. Jagr didnt do nearly as well, Ryder and Havlet were pretty bad."

devils,3cu4af,kevkev667,3,Fri Jul 10 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"I vaguely remember being cautiously optimistic about Havlat but not really expecting much.

At this point, I think there was starting to be some unrest surrounding Larsson and Severson forced his way into our immediate view during the prospects camp.

devils,3cu4af,rphill,3,Sat Jul 11 00:48:11 2015 UTC,"Well...given what happened in the 2013-2014 season, we were just 5 points shy of a playoff spot, and could have possibly made the playoffs if we had won say, half of the shootouts we played in.  With that being said, after the 2013-2014 season our team didn't look great, but not dismal either.  I think we were all expecting for Schneider to be comfortable as #1, hoping Henrique would further develop and point more points up, we pretty much had the same roster, except we added Cammy, so, with that status quo, we could only go up from there, right? Same roster essentially, but a few minor tweaks and changes it sure as hell was better than the 2013-2014 season.  Surely we would also win a few shootouts, I mean, when you win ZERO, there's no where to go except up.  We won the first three games in a row, then all our hopes and dreams came crashing down, and us devils fans were left heartbroken.   I will always bleed red, and be a die-hard Devils fan.  With that being said, 2015-2016 doesn't look like a playoff year for us frankly.  I could be wrong though, trying to keep optimistic, but maybe it's another year of missed playoffs and who knows, maybe get a shot at Auston Matthews for #1 draft pick who is supposed to have the caliber of someone like Jack Eichel."

They have their place in the organization, but I would rather not be a team that talks about their past more than looking forward towards their future."
devils,3cplpk,Dallas1229,14,Thu Jul 9 19:47:45 2015 UTC,Agreed. We haven't had anything great to talk about since 2012. We needed this overhaul.   All hail Shero*until he fucks up and we get our pitchforks
devils,3cplpk,DiscipleofGrohl,5,Thu Jul 9 20:28:48 2015 UTC,"Its a results driven industry. Missing the playoffs 4 out of 5 years is a good indication you dont have much depth withing your organization. Say what you want about the miracle cup run, but we were by no means going to remain competitive with the way things have been going."
devils,3cplpk,Dallas1229,8,Thu Jul 9 20:34:02 2015 UTC,"It was only a matter of time. I've been dreading this for awhile. I knew we would eventually bottom out. It was a combination of age, stars leaving, and the game getting faster each year.  If Shero stays on the right path, I'd like to think in 2-3 years we can compete again. We will definitely be mediocre this year. Every good team has a game changer, and supplements it with depth forwards. We have none of that. No ""Stars"", and no depth."
devils,3cplpk,DiscipleofGrohl,5,Thu Jul 9 20:40:37 2015 UTC,"Its just the way the league has gone unfortunatly. Free agency has been thin for years (unless you are talking about players who are leaving NJ). Its almost impossible for teams to remain competitive without getting good draft picks.   One might argue Detroit has beaten the odds, but they havent made it past the 2nd round in quite some time, and as of late they have looked mediocre. Had we kept Parise maybe things would be different, but we are still thin at right wing.   Lets just hope we get better at retaining our awesome talent."
devils,3cplpk,Dallas1229,6,Thu Jul 9 20:44:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Having Parise and Kovy leaving within a year of each other crushed us. Having one or the other (but fuck that Kovy contract) may have helped, but that's the hand we were dealt. We can't get any worse, so it can only get better!  Detroit definitely beat the odds. But their old guys are still so damn good. Better than the vets we have retained. They also had fantastic coaching for so long as well. Will be interesting to see where they land now that Babcock is gone. I did think they addressed their UFA needs well."
devils,3cplpk,DiscipleofGrohl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:51:07 2015 UTC,If we still had Parise and Kovy we would of made the playoffs every year since 2012. Most teams don't have to go through a rebuild because you lose your two best players due to getting homesick.

devils,3cplpk,meh-mehmeh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:48:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but drafting needs to account for losing players through FA. Clarkson would have walked, he was worth too much money. Parise wanted to go home. It might not be Conte's fault he left, but it is Conte's fault we didnt have a player developing to at least put up some of Zach's numbers. Kovalchuk is the only pass he gets cuz that shit was so unpredictable and even sacrificed a lot of future for the player."
devils,3cplpk,Dallas1229,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:53:04 2015 UTC,"I think the larger blame could be put on ownership.  Parise and Kovy bounced because 1) they wanted to go home, and 2) if they didn't they weren't exactly sure where they would call home for the future because the devils ownership situation was a disaster.  I'm fairly confident if the devils had the owners they do now, both of them would still be a Devil.  And I would expect them to be fairly successful, so clarkson probably would have stuck around, instead of seeing a team continuously get worse.    I would also like to point out I'm excited that conte is gone, I haven't been a fan of his scouting for a while."

devils,3cpyra,Nickynagz,3,Fri Jul 10 01:38:18 2015 UTC,Maybe for a few games. Last year he had 25G-33A-58P in 61 games played. This year he had 17G-30A-47P in 57 games played. 11 less points in 4 less games this year compared to last year. Playoffs are a different story though. Last year he played 9 games and had 13 points (5G-8A) and this year he had 19 points in 19 games (10G-9A). Just copying off of his wiki page. Didn't follow the Brandon Wheat Kings at all. Anybody that did want to take a crack at why his production was down?
devils,3cpyra,Johnborkowski,3,Fri Jul 10 02:00:07 2015 UTC,Mostly Brandon's C depth from what I understand. He was relegated to a middle six role but still produced at a pretty decent clip. His 19 points in 19 games was good for 2nd on the team in the playoffs though which is encouraging. He'll never be an Art Ross winner but he's a good enough 2 way player to play that same middle six role in the NHL.

devils,3csu1y,The_Friedberger,11,Fri Jul 10 14:20:37 2015 UTC,"I see your point but I think management is under the impression that we can get turned around in 2 years.    That being said, IF a trade were to happen and we get a 1st rounder, I dont think a 25-30 draft pick is going to do much for us at this point.  Schneider gives us the best chance to get this team back into the playoffs in the next 3 years then whatever we pick in that draft would be.    I really dont think a Schneider trade is logical at this point."
devils,3csu1y,vVvMaze,-4,Fri Jul 10 14:28:07 2015 UTC,"That's why I think waiting until the deadline would be in their best interest. Teams like the Coyotes, Canes, maybe even Buffalo, would really benefit from having an elite goalie. I'm thinking the bottom 5 this year will be Devils, Coyotes, Hurricanes, Maple Leafs, and Sharks. All those teams (excluding Devils) could use some good goaltending. While I agree that Schneider would help us get back into the playoffs, I don't see this team being at a level to compete at that level for a 3 years at the least."
devils,3csu1y,animatedhockeyfan,11,Fri Jul 10 14:46:48 2015 UTC,"So...we get rid of Schneider to accelerate our rebuild by trading him to a currently rebuilding team? Assuming the first point makes sense (it doesn't), then why on earth would those teams you mentioned want him? To slow down their rebuild?  The reason trading him makes no sense is that at best he gains us 4-5 spots in the standings; and the only thing that affects is where we draft. Whoever we end up drafting with this theoretical higher pick won't be relevant to the team we ice in two years time when things have turned around.   Finally, if we trade him, what do you expect back? The return will never be in our favour. No sense losing a trade where we send away an elite goalie."
devils,3csu1y,MatthewWickerbasket,-4,Fri Jul 10 14:56:25 2015 UTC,"Those aren't necessarily the teams that he would go to. Winnipeg is another place I could see him going. And teams like Buffalo are much further along in their rebuild. Buffalo at this point is only missing a good goalie. The other pieces are there.  And how would the player we draft next year in the first round not be relevant to the team? Say we get Auston Matthews. He's already gaining comparisons to Toews. Explain how a player like that wouldn't have an impact on the team two years later?  As for trade return, to the right buyer, I could see a first round pick, and prospects (somewhere in the C to B- range)"
devils,3csu1y,xbassistdoodx,5,Fri Jul 10 15:09:20 2015 UTC,"So you're suggesting we tank for Auston Matthews? What happens if we trade Schneider and our young guns finally kick in so we get stuck with a mid-level draft pick again? We'd be in the same position, only with Kinky as our starter."
devils,3csu1y,riccarjo,-4,Fri Jul 10 15:18:19 2015 UTC,That's why I said at the deadline. Trading at the draft would work too. There are always free agent goalies who can hold us over.
devils,3csu1y,Clarkson23,12,Fri Jul 10 15:21:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think Schneider needs to go in order for the rebuild to go through. Here's why:  Will Schneider single-handedly win us games that we would have lost otherwise and get us in a slightly worse draft position because of it? Almost certainly. But it comes down to this: with our blue line being so young, we need a guy like Schneider in net to cover the mistakes they may make during the learning process. They need somebody behind them that will cover their mistakes and let them grow as players and let them take risks. They simply wouldn't be able to do that with Yann Danis or Kieth Kinkaid in net (although Kinkaid has the potential to be that kind of guy by the time he's Schneider's age)."
devils,3csu1y,Clarkson23,9,Fri Jul 10 14:28:31 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not.  This subreddit gets crazy sometimes.  Why would we trade away a good 6-10 years of elite and then great goaltending just for a chance at a few good players int he draft.  Then we're left stuck int he mud when we have no good goalie prospects and a great top line, we then turn into Vancouver.  Who aren't really doing all that great."

devils,3csu1y,Clarkson23,3,Fri Jul 10 17:39:08 2015 UTC,We do not have Anthony Brodeur. He was not extended a contract and went into the draft this year.
devils,3csu1y,Sunny_Mehta,8,Fri Jul 10 16:03:37 2015 UTC,"I think the Devils will be able to compete strongly in 2 years. The defense is there and will use the time to only gel and become stronger, phasing out the weak links with the additions of Mozik, Santini, and others, and trading away some pieces. Our top 6 is the problem, but we have the core and are just missing 1 or 2 top line guys. Henrique, Zajac, Cammy, Elias, and Palmieri are all great 2nd line players. Cammy is a top liner and Zajac can play that role. So, our 2nd line is set with Henrique and Palmieri on the wings with Zajac in the middle. Hopefully the top line would be Cammy, Zajac, and enter a UFA/Trade acquisition/Top pick winger and that is your top line. 3rd line would have Boucher and Matteau and either JJ or an upcoming UFA/AHLer turned NHLer (ie Quenneville/Blandisi/Wood). I think the Devils will have a very quick turnaround, and with any luck of JJ, Henrique, Boucher, or Matteau turning into solid players, we we will be set. I think this year and next year will be tough, but year 3 will be a Cup contending team, and we will need Cory then. If these players develop quickly, then we could even see playoff contention for the 2016-2017 season. However, for the right price, assuming a 1st rd pick, a goali, and a #1 winger, then sure."
devils,3csu1y,xbassistdoodx,3,Fri Jul 10 14:31:39 2015 UTC,"Henrique, Zajac, Cammy, Elias, and Palmieri are all great 2nd line players   Zajac and Elias 'great 2nd line players'?  Zajac would be a 3rd liner on every team probably BUT ours and Elias, while a great Devil, wouldn't crack most teams' checking line right now."
devils,3csu1y,xbassistdoodx,8,Fri Jul 10 14:39:37 2015 UTC,"You're right that Elias is on the decline, but I do think that Zajac is a solid 2nd line center. He has been playing against top lines, but once he starts playing with good wingers against slightly less skilled players he will shine. But he has been asked to showdown against the Crosby, Ovi, Stamkos, Nash, etc... lines, and has been solid."
devils,3csu1y,artestsidekick,2,Fri Jul 10 15:51:07 2015 UTC,I give Zajac a disproportionate amount of shit because of that extortionate contract.
devils,3csu1y,battlecross94,3,Fri Jul 10 15:56:10 2015 UTC,That's a joke I hope. Elias was playing with absolute scrubs and still put up numbers. Put him on a second line with players who can play and he would be insane. Zajac is also better than you give him credit for. His rw much of the season was Tootoo and Bernier.
devils,3csu1y,FilmNerdasaurus,2,Fri Jul 10 15:55:50 2015 UTC,I take umbrage with using words like 'GREAT' and 'INSANE'.    That's more the beef I have here.  I'm not slagging them off saying they're garbage.  They're neither insane nor great on a consistent basis.  That's no joke.
devils,3csu1y,battlecross94,-2,Fri Jul 10 16:00:41 2015 UTC,"I think two years is being very optimistic. Zajac dreams of being a top line center. He was only good when he had Parise to carry him. Elias will likely retire at the end of this season. I think it'll be tough to grow through free agency. Just looking ahead to next year there isn't much talent out there. And the players that will be available will likely get re-signed (you think Stamkos is gonna walk?). If we could trade Schneider at the deadline to a high first round pick, an okay forward, and prospects, I would be okay with it. The chance to draft a guy like Auston Matthews would be huge. But being able to take him and another great prospect? I'd be all over that. My only concern is that our goaltending prospects are limited to Blackwood. It'll be interesting to see how it all plays out."
devils,3csu1y,Clarkson23,2,Fri Jul 10 14:41:53 2015 UTC,"I'd feel at least a tiny bit more comfortable if we could sign Appleby after the development camp, assuming he does well."
devils,3csu1y,DarthReilly,0,Fri Jul 10 15:38:08 2015 UTC,Right? How this guy went undrafted for 3 years is beyond me. He closed the door on McDavid and Strome.
devils,3csu1y,Satans_BFF,2,Fri Jul 10 15:49:34 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If the kid can play, I'd feel much more comfortable having him in the pipeline if we traded Cory. Which again, I don't want to see happen, but at least it'd ease the pain a little bit."
devils,3csu1y,babrooks213,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:04:07 2015 UTC,"I do think we need to get some great prospects (ie 1st-5th overall picks) in the next 2 drafts. But then I think we will explode. Defense and Goaltending is already A+ assuming 2 years of development and struggling a bit during this time. Then we are back to Forwards. Cammy and Henrique can be 1st line players if we get a 1st line center. A 2nd line of Palmieri and Zajac is solid. 3rd of Matteau, Elias (assuming he returns at a discount), and Tootoo and a 4th line TBD. All that is missing is a #1C and #2LW. Then you have Zacha, Boucher, Quenneville, Wood, Blandisi, the next two years of picks, and others to fill those spots. It's no easy task, but you would hope that Zacha turns into a #1C or Wing and that one of the other top draft pick in '16/'17 can fill some spots. We will have a very young and deep team very quickly."
devils,3csu1y,babrooks213,7,Fri Jul 10 16:01:54 2015 UTC,Thank god (satan?) you're not running the team. We're not far off from contending. Just need a few guys that can put the puck in the goddamn net.

devils,3csu1y,safruki,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:24:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe you're right maybe you're not. Maybe some guys will finally turn it around offensively and play to their full potential. I still think it's not worth trading arguably the best player on the team. Say Schneider does get traded away, we have Kinkaid who doesn't have enough NHL experience to be a starter yet and a back up of Yann Danis who has all of 50 or so games in the NHL. Well be worse off without Schneider  and the rebuild will take even longer"
devils,3csu1y,Angigolo,6,Fri Jul 10 15:32:28 2015 UTC,"If I'm a UFA or a player from SKA or another league and you tell me you have Schneider in net, I'd be more inclined to join your team. Schneider will also sell more jerseys, win more games, and make this team more money. From a business and sports look, Schneider is the saving grace right now."
devils,3csu1y,JaquesNoir,7,Fri Jul 10 15:52:57 2015 UTC,LOL
devils,3csu1y,steampunkjesus,5,Fri Jul 10 15:36:39 2015 UTC,I think there is more than 1 way to rebuild. Most rebuilding teams like us have better offence and worse D and goaltending. We are just rebuilding the part we are weakest at.   Keep our strengths while doing it. You now see teams like Edmonton and Buffalo scrambling and giving away assets for goalies. I wouldn't put much faith in either of the goalies they got this year either. They're going to waste a lot of assets until they finally get a goalie anywhere near Schneiders calibre.
devils,3csu1y,JaquesNoir,4,Fri Jul 10 16:25:19 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, we're roughly where the Devils were in '93, '94-ish. We have an amazing goalie, a young defense that looks extremely promising, and not enough support up front.  We have a lot of depth at forward as is (hear me out for a second) - Zajac, Henrique, Palms, and Cammalleri are all good enough to be second liners. We have a few players who can fill out the bottom 6 (like Josefson) and hopefully the kids we've drafted can make the leap to that bottom 6 (Mattaeu, Boucher, Quenneville).  Basically, we have almost everything except for a couple of 30 goal scorers or guys who can be gamebreakers. We're not that far off from winning again."
devils,3csu1y,JaquesNoir,0,Fri Jul 10 16:59:02 2015 UTC,"We definitely have depth at forwards. Problem is our prospects, for the most part, will only ever make 3rd line. It's impossible to build an entire top line without drafting well. And having high picks to do so would be nice. Unless we somehow could sign Stamkos next year (I wish) the only options left are trades.  Also Zajac is a joke. I like the guy, but on any other team he'd be a 3rd line center."
devils,3csu1y,JaquesNoir,3,Fri Jul 10 17:15:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's fair to Zajac. Here's a post that just went up recently, looking at the top two-way centers in the league over the last 5 years.  The Cliff's Notes is that, essentially, Zajac isn't a top center when measuring offensive performance, but he's among the best in the league when it comes to playing a defensive game.  When he played with Parise and Kovalchuk, he scored more, which isn't surprising, but without them, he's a very strong defensive center.  Now that Parise/Kovalchuk aren't here anymore, Zajac has to find a way to score. That's a criticism of his game that's well-deserved - he's got to find a way to put up more points.  But to dismiss him because of that completely overlooks the other half of his game, which is keeping folks like Crosby and Ovechkin from putting up points, which he does a very good job of."
devils,3csu1y,Mgnyc11,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:34:57 2015 UTC,"There's no denying he's great in the defensive end. I think he may be the only Devils who consistently wins faceoffs. He's invaluable on the PK. But for the amount of money he makes, he should be scoring at least 50 points. The only way he produces points are when he's surrounded by great talent."
devils,3csu1y,JimbroG,5,Fri Jul 10 17:43:32 2015 UTC,This team is built around Schneider. Trading him will make this rebuild 5 years and could really hamper the plans. Also 32 isn't end of his career. This team will be in the playoffs this year and it's because of Schneider.

We have the best possible person to be in net for us (even at his age, he doesn't have much tread on the tires), and we are almost done building up our defense. Next, we get good forwards, and it's a successful build from the net out.  Trading Schneider will set us back AT LEAST 5 years"

Goaltending is one of the hardest positions to fill, and until we have Brodeur or Schneider 2.0 in the minors, letting Schneider go would kill us...

He won the 2013 U-18 IIHF ""best defender of the tournament"" award even though he registered 0 points IIRC. However, I'd like to see Larsson-Severson and Gelinas-Santini if I had my choosing ( I think Lars, sevs, and santini, are all interchangeable in top 3)"
devils,3clyww,Devilslegion,4,Thu Jul 9 05:27:15 2015 UTC,"They actually aren't that interchangeable. When it comes to defenseman, and because the position is so tough, they are usually placed by the handedness of their shot. Severson and Larsson are righties so they'll play right side. As sad as it sounds, we'll never see a Larsson-Sevs pairing unless our coaching decides to play one on the off side which, unless it on the PP, is very dumb from a coaching perspective. Gelly is the only one I can see doing that because his off-side opens up his incredible shot"
devils,3clyww,KovalSNIPE17,2,Thu Jul 9 11:59:20 2015 UTC,Gelly will be a 3rd line winger in 2 years when Santini is ready to become a full timer.
devils,3clyww,DudeFalcone,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:08:43 2015 UTC,I agree I'd prefer to have them on their correct sides but I see everyone else talking about Severson-santini as a top unit while they're both RHD mostly because we don't have a top LHD. If that's the case Id rather have Larsson up there.

devils,3clyww,dlstove,4,Thu Jul 9 01:51:21 2015 UTC,"I saw Santini play against Boston College 2 years ago. His positioning was sound, but I really like his outlets. His ""brain speed"" is high. I don't think he a dangler with a great release, but he'll get the transition game going. He's going to be a good leader as well.   He really struggled, in my opinion, at the end of last year. Perhaps it was coming back too soon from the wrist injury? He look a little slower physically and mentally. He did not have the same edge he had when I first saw him.  I'm glad he'll spend another year and I hope he dominates."

Can't see why he'd leave"
devils,3chmd6,bringmethefunk,2,Tue Jul 7 23:56:08 2015 UTC,Maybe he'd like to go somewhere he has a chance of winning? Or maybe because of their cap issues?

I also doubt that next year we see another Dougie Hamilton type situation with Voracek.

I'd honestly like to see him packaged to Edmonton because of it. He is a solid player, has a low cap hit and they need D.  I feel like the Devils new style of play requires offense from every person, including the lowest pair of D and fourth line. That's why we got Moore vs a guy like Fraser."

Plus, we've got Helgeson and Mozik that can slide in there for Gelinas and/or Moore anytime they want and that would provide us with more pure defense.   I really don't see what the problem is."

devils,3cbv6c,SeniorSophomore,7,Mon Jul 6 18:26:50 2015 UTC,Confirmed that he will wear #21
devils,3cco3c,bringmethefunk,6,Mon Jul 6 21:47:59 2015 UTC,"Tl;DW Zacha has some huge upsides - he uses his body to his advantage, has great passing, can generate good footspeed on the rush, good hands, great backhander.  He can be a bit soft on the backcheck, but that can be trained out of him, tends to overhandle the puck, but that is a habit in rookies, needs to use his speed and body on D.  He had great offensive moves in this game, and one or two great moments playing defensively, but overall needs to up his defensive game. Also, lots of comments that he might be better suited to the wing over center, but time will tell.  Seems like another year of junior would suit him well, help him round out his game and up his confidence. Maybe that would help him get better at faceoffs too."
devils,3cco3c,ama5342,4,Tue Jul 7 14:21:36 2015 UTC,"Loved this bringmeth. Although I love Zacha as a prospect, it puts in perspective where in his development he is for the NA game."

devils,3ccng8,Dallas1229,5,Mon Jul 6 21:43:17 2015 UTC,"This is fantastic.  Merrill is probably the least talked about young D-man on the team. Gelinas has his shot, Severson had his Calder-esque first month, and Larsson has just been a rollercoaster of emotion. But Merrill seems to plod along, not making any noise.   It's really interesting to me that he does so much, not only for our defence, but our scoring. I can't say I notice him too much when he's on the ice. I guess the numbers suggest that's a great thing - A solid, puck possessing D-man who makes smart choices and passes."
devils,3ccng8,bringmethefunk,5,Mon Jul 6 22:05:36 2015 UTC,"Very similiar to the start of Greenes career. Very unnoticed d-man, but very good play.  Maybe this will help quiet some of the trade Merrill talk."
devils,3ccng8,pro_omnibus,5,Mon Jul 6 22:19:06 2015 UTC,"This is why I would rather trade Gelinas than Merrill.  Gelinas has been talked about much more, and is a rather more ""known"" quantity than Merrill.  It would take a wizard to get more for Merrill(sturdy but hasn't stood out) than Gelinas(shaky but flashy enough to garner interest from teams needing PP help)."
devils,3ccng8,DudeFalcone,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:21:27 2015 UTC,"Gelinas reminds me of Sheldon Souray. Not so much the physical aspect, but a player with a hard shot and not quite knowing how to use it at a young age."
devils,3ccng8,heheyousaidduty,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:48:50 2015 UTC,Greenie/Lars Sev/Moore Gelly/Merrill  Could swap Moore and Merrill on the pairings but that's what I could see the starting line up be on opening night.
devils,3ccng8,Skylightt,2,Tue Jul 7 02:33:31 2015 UTC,"I think we want to move away from pairing Larsson with Greene once Larsson starts showing signs of being a strong d-man. Greene is very good at helping inexperienced d-men.   Larsson/Greene is a tremendous shut down pair, but I feel it is also wasted potential for young guys who need a veteran partner."
devils,3ccng8,Skylightt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:58:31 2015 UTC,"I feel like if this team wants to be competitive this year, they are going to have to use Greene/Larsson assuming they're still the ""shut down"" pair. We really, really need some of those young dmen to grow into players that don't necessarily NEED a stabilizing presence like Greene on the ice with them at all times. I'm predicting that Jon Merrill will be that guy. I think in our new system he'll be able to make a little more noise on the stat sheet, and maybe even out his +/- rating too. I'd say Helgeson is a dark horse candidate if he makes the team out of camp, especially if one of the other prospects is moved."
devils,3c8b63,VasiliiZaytsev,17,Sun Jul 5 21:05:15 2015 UTC,Not very surprising and not an issue. Just happy Larsson is back and those stupid rumors from last year are over

devils,3c8b63,SeniorSophomore,8,Mon Jul 6 02:18:43 2015 UTC,Hopefully Ray can get Larsson locked up long term this summer.
devils,3c8b63,TrueJersey,16,Sun Jul 5 21:15:06 2015 UTC,"I'd rather see Adam get a two-or-three year bridge deal like PK Subban got before he cashed in on a long-term deal. We know that Larsson can play but if we lock him up now for 6+ years and something happens (injuries, poor form, etc) the contract won't be a liability. He had a great half-season after Deboer got fired, IMO just that and his potential don't justify a long-term deal"
devils,3c8b63,XxMiKeNjD17xX,8,Sun Jul 5 21:28:50 2015 UTC,"He's had more than just one good half of a season. You're right though, a 2-3 year deal wouldn't be the end of the world."
devils,3c8b63,TrueJersey,2,Sun Jul 5 22:04:23 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a high risk / high reward type of thing.  Sign him now for 6 years and average money, or make it less money on a shorter term, but then you have to pay up once that contract's done.  So you could either play it safe on a bridge contract, or you could gamble and get him on a great deal for down the road like John Tavares..."
devils,3c8b63,captain_throwaway87,2,Sun Jul 5 21:36:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's in the player's favor to sign a shorter term contract now that will take him through just before his last year of RFA. Then use that one year as a leverage to get a long term deal for a premium, or take a one year deal and test free agency."
devils,3c8b63,sinbushar,7,Mon Jul 6 01:34:30 2015 UTC,"Not worried. This quote by Shero, ""They're two important players for the organization,""... ""It's important for us to build around Adam."" comforts me knowing he knows how important Larsson will be to this team and to a lesser degree gelinas"
devils,3c8b63,Devilslegion,2,Mon Jul 6 01:18:45 2015 UTC,I really hope this doesn't go to arbitration. Last thing we need is Larsson hearing why he shouldn't be paid that much. Dont need that relationship strained considering its finally going in the right direction.

devils,3c8b63,skyturnedred,3,Mon Jul 6 08:31:39 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, if the Devils and these players don't reach an agreement for a contract by a certain deadline, the NHLPA brings in an arbitrator to hear both sides and comes up with a contract that's pretty much take it or leave it.  Parise went to arbitration in the 2011 offseason (Devils signed him to a one-year deal before the arbitrator decided) and more recently, Ryan O'Reilly and the Avs went to arbitration last summer (arbitrator decided on a 2 year deal)"

devils,3c8b63,nooneexistsonpurpose,2,Mon Jul 6 17:25:34 2015 UTC,"Hindsight obviously proves differently here, but it's usually better to not let an arbitrator come up with the contract.

devils,3c7huu,TweetPoster,4,Sun Jul 5 16:43:48 2015 UTC,"I know we have a hole there, but didn't we learn our lesson with havlat or Ryder? Stop with the retreads if the plan is to go young.

devils,3c7huu,njd9500,4,Sun Jul 5 19:49:32 2015 UTC,"The only thing I'd say is that since we're (hopefully) not bringing back Ryder or Havlat and we're definitely not bringing back Gomez, there is definitely room for him, if the price is right. And by room for him I mean room for him to play and teach some of our younger players without gobbling up too much ice time from them in the process. And if he's able to get any of his scoring touch back it would benefit us in that come the trade deadline he could get up some draft picks if we're not a contender.   Plus, think of all the semen jokes"
devils,3c7huu,voxangelikus,3,Mon Jul 6 03:00:46 2015 UTC,"I wrote about this in another thread about signing him, but we don't really have all that much room for him.  We have 10 forwards who probably aren't going anywhere (since Semin would probably go on the 1st/2nd lines, he's not knocking a guy like tootoo off the 4th line). Add Boucher/Matteau that's 12. Shero wants to give younger players a shot and you're realistically looking at like 2 spots (we signed the KHL guy and Shero has said he wants to give Zacha a shot out of camp).    As for ""teaching"" the younger kids... what is he going to teach? His Caps teammates have said they weren't even sure if he'd make it to games, yet alone give anything resembling a consistent effort and while none of the Canes players have said anything, none of them have said anything to dispel the rumors. Why do we want him in the room? I'm all for adding offense to this roster, we desperately need it, but we need the RIGHT player more than just ANY player."
devils,3c7huu,njd9500,2,Mon Jul 6 10:55:33 2015 UTC,See I wasn't totally aware of his negative attitude in the dressing room. If he was going to be a more positive force in the locker room I could see it. But I'd rather not have that distraction. (Commence offer sheet for Tarasenko /s)

devils,3c7huu,Clarkson23,3,Sun Jul 5 18:32:41 2015 UTC,The Devils are one of the weakest teams at RW and they have tons of cap space... it's very easy to speculate that they might sign Semin. This is just some kid trying to look like an insider by making the same speculation as everyone else and hoping that it comes true.
devils,3c7huu,VasiliiZaytsev,4,Sun Jul 5 19:05:05 2015 UTC,"I disagree; in general, Shero has been moving as young as possible with picks/prospects, so signing someone like Semin would be a deviation from that course."
devils,3c7huu,ascagnel,3,Sun Jul 5 19:22:28 2015 UTC,yeah... but at the same time you still need to have some older players on the ice... or you get slapped

No hope no pain this year though.   I just want it to be a good development year for some young players. Severson was fun to watch last year.

You're telling me the best free agent they signed this off season, and he wasn't even a true free agent was jordan tootoo!? Palmieri trade was great, but Lou never went into a season expecting to miss the playoffs.  The Devils needed a lot of help on offense and they got a little.  I had hope at the start of last season the Devils would be able to put things together.  I'm confident the Devils are going into a development / rebuild season this year though."

I enjoy watching Schneider put on a clinic on the blue line or seeing Cammy turn on the jets with the puck on his stick.   As long as the team actually TRIES to win games this season with Hynes, and Shero taking the team in a new direction I will have no problems watching.   I think stomaching a new season of passive play, and veterans who have checked out mentally like Elias and Zubrus while trying to get a wild card like last season was the worst thing in the world."

Oh boy I sure hope JORDIN TOOTOO and quadragenarian PATRICK ELIAS can lead this team to victory!""  We're the more...realistic type of fan. This squad is going to stink it up. We aren't watching this team hoping that they make the playoffs. Some of us are watching this team with a keen eye for the youngsters, hoping that they can get some experience this year and make some huge strides in confidence and talent.    I am extremely excited, once again, to watch this Devils team, moreso than in the last two season where we tried to glue an aging roster together with fading journeymen who couldn't get a contract elsewhere. This team is getting very young and I can't wait to see the kids develop."

Can't string two passes together, dumping and chasing all day, young guys taking penalties.     So hell yea with some injuries to franchise players in our division we can make it.

devils,3c0cog,daprodigyx19,3,Fri Jul 3 17:52:31 2015 UTC,I understand that he want the team be young but Semin at 31 isn't old yet. He isn't going to make us a playoff team but he could potentially gets us more picks at the draft if he plays well. I mean you see the picks the FLA sent us Palmeri for essentially 20 games of Jagr even though he re-signed with them.
devils,3c0cog,jagknife96,6,Fri Jul 3 18:06:28 2015 UTC,"We aren't a playoff team this year, no matter what happens. It's not Shero's plan.  I would go for Semin though, 1-2 year deal. 3 would be pushing it but it'd have to be a reasonable deal.  If anything, I'd like 1 year deals for older vets to trade at the deadline, but I'm also okay with standing pat with no significant deals this summer. Let younger guys get experience under a coach who doesn't hate youth."
devils,3c0cog,TheRealKozi,2,Fri Jul 3 18:23:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Minus the signing vets I think you're on point. We aren't a playoff team, probably not for 3 years maybe more depending on how drafting goes."
devils,3c0cog,jagknife96,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:07:26 2015 UTC,"The only reason why I think we should get a vet or two is for trade fodder, otherwise, I think we should use our youth to gauge where exactly this team is, prospect wise.

devils,3bxrz4,blahzach1988,7,Fri Jul 3 03:44:40 2015 UTC,"Bottom 6 finish, possibly bottom 3.  I love the team but being realistic we are going to have a very difficult year against the Rangers, Islanders, Flyers, Capitals and Penguins. I see us finishing last in the division. Only teams worse will probably be Arizona, Toronto and maybe Vanvouver.   We're under the cap at the moment but that's simply a precaution to match any offer on Larsson and Gelinas.   Our back end I think is promising, but up front we're going to have growing pains. We have a semi-decent top line but the rest of the team is basically bottom 6 forwards or rookies.   I believe in Shero, but unlike a few fans it's not a 1-2 year fix. I think he's got a 4 or 5 year plan looking at our defensive core and when other players might be expected to retire or taking a backseat role on the team."

He's building the team over time rather than going all-out ""win now"" mode, which is what Lou's been doing his whole time here.

Then they change the playoff format and it seems like we can't get in because of that. But then I realize we're just not that good a team right now. We need time and development (thankfully in the right direction now it seems)!  So I'd have to say come the end of next season we'll be somewhere right around where we were this year. Get a nice top ten pick and maybe use our cap space to bring in a decent UFA to keep the build moving in a positive direction.

Im sorry, and I love Henrique, but that is classic over rating of a home team player if you dont think they are at least similar players point production wise.

They are, as /u/DarthReilly stated, at least comparable players."

Also, the Yotes can't activate him off LTIR, he isn't on it now, and can't be on it til the new season starts. That's the trick with LTIR, you can only exceed the cap by 10% in the offsets on so with a player like Clowe, Pronged or Savard on the books it limits your flexibility in the offseason"

devils,3bs38h,FilmNerdasaurus,18,Wed Jul 1 19:21:46 2015 UTC,Good signing. Shows Shero is really committed to not overpaying aged and washed up talent. The age movement is real. We might very well go from being the oldest team to the youngest team in the league in less than 1 year.  Really impressed with how much Shero learned since his time in Pittsburgh.

I think 1 or 2 of them may even be let go or stuck in the press box this year anyway.... I feel a young RFA trade coming our way in the next year or so. Like a Saad or Hamilton trade."

devils,3bs38h,riccarjo,6,Wed Jul 1 19:13:21 2015 UTC,Very shrewd signing by Shero. Nice depth d-man who can contribute. Frees us up to trade somebody and gives us some additional experience.
devils,3bs38h,maradonuts,4,Wed Jul 1 18:27:55 2015 UTC,I remember playing against him... But what's his deal?
devils,3bs38h,riccarjo,5,Wed Jul 1 18:20:28 2015 UTC,"Very solid defenseman. Probably 2nd-3rd line on a contender and is only 24, so he should only improve."

devils,3bs38h,riccarjo,5,Wed Jul 1 20:55:19 2015 UTC,Of course he means pairing. No need to be pedantic.

devils,3bs38h,DavidPuddy666,-5,Wed Jul 1 18:25:25 2015 UTC,"My point is, if he's playing on the third pairing, how big of a difference will it really make? Helgeson seemed to be doing fine IIRC and I hope he'll stay in the Devils organization.  If Helgeson does stay with us, and Merrill and Gelly aren't traded, I don't see what signing Moore does unless we decide to dress 7 defensemen (which doesn't sound like Shero's MO)."
devils,3btlzh,VasiliiZaytsev,10,Thu Jul 2 01:19:19 2015 UTC,well thats upsetting
devils,3btlzh,kevkev667,8,Thu Jul 2 01:28:19 2015 UTC,Honestly don't see him being a NHL regular but good luck
devils,3btlzh,Clarkson23,5,Thu Jul 2 01:30:52 2015 UTC,Depth signing by the Islanders. Joe would have had a better chance of cracking the NJ line up over the Islanders.
devils,3btlzh,Dallas1229,3,Thu Jul 2 01:36:07 2015 UTC,"Is he any good? On paper, it seeemed he got better every year in the AHL. But being 5'6"" makes it hard to succeed in professional sports."
devils,3btlzh,viewless25,9,Thu Jul 2 02:13:50 2015 UTC,He always did very well for the Albany Devils but could never really translate his game to the NHL. He also scored his first NHL goal this past season on a quick wrist shot that surprised everyone.

devils,3btlzh,davegarri,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:52:49 2015 UTC,"I commented on this in another thread, but I think he could have done well with our new staff. People have been saying he never translated his game to the NHL, however he played a total of 5 NHL games for about a total of 35 minutes. When you're getting 7 minutes a night it's kind of hard to show what you can do. I think with the direction the team is going now and focusing on younger guys (although he is 27), I think he would have been given a good shot."

devils,3bqwlw,JulianTheManatee,4,Wed Jul 1 13:22:45 2015 UTC,Also whatever we offer will be matched so it's pointless.  Good write up man.
devils,3bqwlw,DevsMetsGmen,6,Wed Jul 1 12:57:17 2015 UTC,"We could trade with the Pens to get our 3rd rounder back, though they probably have no interest in giving a division rival the ability to offer sheet someone."
devils,3bqwlw,davegarri,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:24:28 2015 UTC,"Surprised OP didn't make this point. If you reacquire your own pick you can offer sheet someone.   Before the last CBA, the compensation was so ridiculously high that no one ever offered anything. The NHLPA negotiated a better arrangement this time around, but unfortunately most teams are still very reluctant to submit offers. Some have suspected a level of collusion, but a bigger problem is that in order to get a team to not match, you'd have to really overspend, and in doing so the value of your offer increases and so does the losing team's compensation.   It's not like the NBA where you could insert those ""poison pill"" clauses in that literally made it impossible for a team to match the offer."
devils,3bqwlw,JJoy21,5,Wed Jul 1 13:33:00 2015 UTC,"Offer sheet JT Miller at $2.5. Force the Rags to get in even deeper cap hell, or swap a 15th overall selection who's going to break out next year for a 2nd rounder"
devils,3bqwlw,steampunkjesus,3,Wed Jul 1 13:56:41 2015 UTC,"Miller or even Jesper Fast, nothing i'd love more than to steal the Rangers young talent or screw up their cap situation even more"
devils,3bqwlw,MutantLeagueMVP,3,Wed Jul 1 14:31:09 2015 UTC,"Well, that settles that then."
devils,3bqwlw,nolan1971,2,Wed Jul 1 12:53:43 2015 UTC,"Compensation aside, I think people tend to overlook the sour taste that offer sheets leave in GMs' mouths, making them even less viable as an option."
devils,3bqwlw,rapier999,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:25:26 2015 UTC,"Being limited to $1.8 mil-$3.6 mil is actually kindof a good thing. Not that the Devils have to worry about cap space at all, but this sort of limitation will keep them from having to worry about it.  And, I mean really, we're not going to land Tarasenko anyway."
devils,3bqwlw,DudeFalcone,2,Wed Jul 1 13:27:21 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Tarasenko is worth pretty much anything up to that four firsts level of compensation, and he'll be matched as such."
devils,3bqwlw,Nanojack,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:58:54 2015 UTC,"+1 for the data--well played sir!  With that being said, hypothetically if we could go after Terasanko (sp?) we don't have the supporting cast to see the type of production he had on STL last year.  We don't have the Oshie, Stastny, Backes, Steen, etc.  Ter was able to put up those points and goals bc other players had to be covered and accounted for.  We lack those standout type players.    Picking up a high caliber player would be ideal yes, but unless we can pick up another high caliber player, I just don't see a point total being there."
devils,3bqwlw,alpachydermatologist,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:56:52 2015 UTC,"Hypothetical-Can we trade with Pittsburgh to get our natural pick back, then offer sheet somebody?   Not that that would happen. The offer sheet is virtually dead in the NHL."
devils,3bqwlw,WHOSGOTABIGGERBUTT,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:25:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, if we got our pick back from Pittsburgh we could then use it as offer sheet compensation."
