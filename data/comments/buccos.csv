I serve at Primantis for everyone that doesn't know, but I had a group of 4 (2 men, 2 woman) people come in. They're from Buffalo on a work trip and just getting real drunk and that's cool = tips! So, we were pretty dead that night so I just bs'd with them the whole time. They were at least over 30 (I'm 23), but they invited me to come drinking with them when they were back in town. I think this week?   There was one guy in the group asking me about gay bars and I'm almost with Courtney for one year so I'm pretty sr8. I said I think there's one downtown and I'm not gay in a relationship etc. So, he's like oh cool. He was like well why don't you show us around town when we come back? I'm like absolutely! let's get drunk. So, I give the gay guy my number and say hey text me etc.  I get this text this morning.  basically he wants to fuck me can't show the number ayyyy lmao"

buccos,3e2mku,Scoonz,10,Tue Jul 21 14:53:31 2015 UTC,"There is no listed ground rule at Kauffman Stadium covering that situation that would make that a ground-rule double: http://kansascity.royals.mlb.com/kc/ballpark/kc_ballpark_groundrules.jsp   Ground Rules  Foul poles -- above surrounding fenceline is a home run. Below surrounding fenceline is in play.  Ball going into dugout, camera bays or hitting padded protective railings along dugout is out of play.  Ball hitting guy wires supporting backstop screen is the same as ball going into stands.  Batted or thrown ball that hits tarpaulin area cover is in play.  Thrown ball lodging in or under backstop protective canvas and remaining: 2 bases; Pitched ball: 1 base.   EDIT: Since there's no ground rule covering this, the MLB automatic double rules (6.09 (e)-(h)) come in to play. In order:   (e) A fair ball, after touching the ground, bounds into the stands, or passes through, over or under a fence, or through or under a scoreboard, or through or under shrubbery, or vines on the fence, in which case the batter and the runners shall be entitled to advance two bases;   Does not apply. The fair ball did not touch the ground.   (f) Any fair ball which, either before or after touching the ground, passes through or under a fence, or through or under a scoreboard, or through any opening in the fence or scoreboard, or through or under shrubbery, or vines on the fence, or which sticks in a fence or scoreboard, in which case the batter and the runners shall be entitled to two bases;   Does not apply. The ball did not pass through or under any fences or etc.   (g) Any bounding fair ball is deflected by the fielder into the stands, or over or under a fence on fair or foul territory, in which case the batter and all runners shall be entitled to advance two bases;   Does not apply. Ball was not deflected by a fielder.   (h) Any fair fly ball is deflected by the fielder into the stands, or over the fence into foul territory, in which case the batter shall be entitled to advance to second base; but if deflected into the stands or over the fence in fair territory, the batter shall be entitled to a home run. However, should such a fair fly be deflected at a point less than 250 feet from home plate, the batter shall be entitled to two bases only.   Still shouldn't apply. A fielder didn't deflect it.  I'm 100% at a loss. I'd love to hear MLB explain this call. Are they counting the padding at the top of the fence as ""ground"" for the purposes of 6.09e?  EDIT2: MLB's response is ""No Comment""? They fucked up."

buccos,3e3w5z,pyates13,4,Tue Jul 21 19:29:56 2015 UTC,"Most people on here don't want Barmes back, but I think he is the most likely of the 3 to end up here. All of them are on expiring deals (Barmes has a team option), but Barmes' $1.3 mil contract looks much better than Zobrist at $7.5 mil and Pennington at $3.3 mil. Adding in his familiarity with the organization, I'd think the Bucs are going take the gamble and hope he continues the improved hitting he's shown this season."
buccos,3e3w5z,raft_man,5,Tue Jul 21 19:46:23 2015 UTC,"You might be right. However, I think Zobrist is the best get....can play 3rd, of, etc. If they want to win a world series, they're going to have to pay for guys like Zobrist."
buccos,3e3w5z,montani,3,Tue Jul 21 20:00:24 2015 UTC,I agree with both of you.  Barmes is most likely because the Padres skullfucked their farm system so they may give him to us for a few fringe guys just to have warm bodies.
buccos,3e3w5z,Dleeu2,2,Tue Jul 21 20:07:42 2015 UTC,Zobrist mainly plays LF/RF/2B. The only other position he has played with any regularity is SS.

buccos,3e3w5z,tonytroz,2,Tue Jul 21 21:25:37 2015 UTC,Barmes is most likely because he's the cheapest and they can sell it to the fan base.
buccos,3e3w5z,PhantomJB93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:47:02 2015 UTC,Barmes isn't a gamble. They'll get him for useless prospects and/or cash if they want him. That's nothing.  The problem is he only looks like a good option because the Pirates have Brent Morel and Sean Rodriguez covering third. He's an upgrade over them obviously but is a 0.5 WAR player even with his hitting this year. That still sucks. I'd rather see them call up Hanson and give him a chance.
buccos,3e3w5z,SmugglingGrapes,2,Tue Jul 21 20:20:04 2015 UTC,"Barmes would be fantastic.  I hated him as much as the next guy when he was our regular starter and there was no other option, but as a bench bat and replacement starter while both Mercer and JHay are out I have absolutely no problem with him."

buccos,3e22m2,caedas11,4,Tue Jul 21 10:36:59 2015 UTC,"Since it's a sellers market and the Bucs are competing with other teams with the resources to overpay for these guys it might be too costly. Price, especially, could cost a top prospect like Bell or Glasnow - probably not going to happen IMO. Given their current situation, I guess if they're going to overpay for someone, it would be for a middle infielder. They're a Neil Walker-back-issue away from this being catastrophic."
buccos,3e22m2,stargellstar,6,Tue Jul 21 11:36:11 2015 UTC,The mindset that trading a prospect for a guy with one or two years of control is automatically an overpay is absolutely wrong.
buccos,3e22m2,montani,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:03:41 2015 UTC,"Depends on who we're talking about, I guess."
buccos,3e22m2,stargellstar,0,Tue Jul 21 13:13:37 2015 UTC,"In this era of much better scouting of young talent, it kinda is. First round (hell, really top 3 or 4 rounds) picks still are far from a 100% success rate dont get me wrong. But in the past decade or so they've been much more likely to reach the majors and provide 2 to 3 WAR or more each year."
buccos,3e22m2,DTX180,5,Tue Jul 21 13:09:31 2015 UTC,Pedro  Jordy  Tony Sanchez  Vic Black  Gerrit Cole  That's everyone since 2008 who has played for the Pirates at all.  If you packaged the prospect versions of the top 4 you could get a ransom of rentals and it would've been worth it in retrospect.
buccos,3e22m2,montani,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:17:58 2015 UTC,"Pedro, maybe Sanchez, and Cole were the only ones that teams would trade their superstar for prospects though. Vic Black has been solid last year (wasnt he a supplemental round pick?)."
buccos,3e22m2,DTX180,2,Tue Jul 21 14:24:51 2015 UTC,Vic Black was part of the trade for Marlon Byrd and John Buck.  Pirates also sent Dilson Herrera to NY.  That trade was absolutely worth it.  Even if Herrera and/or Black turn out very good.
buccos,3e22m2,stargellstar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:44:04 2015 UTC,"not saying it wasnt. I'm saying that the quality of scouting has increased the value of top tier prospects to prior (pre mid 00s, when analytics really starting hitting the prospect market) eras. 1 year of Price isn't probably worth it. 2 years? Maybe."
buccos,3e22m2,DTX180,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:36 2015 UTC,"No, I totally agree."
buccos,3e22m2,stargellstar,4,Tue Jul 21 18:44:28 2015 UTC,Zobrist should be at the top of the list.
buccos,3e22m2,raft_man,3,Tue Jul 21 16:11:06 2015 UTC,Agree the infield is priority or someone that hits and has some degree of club control.

I wouldn't be surprised if Huntington makes a call to figure out how much they would cost, but I don't think he's going to pull the trigger for rentals. I think an infielder like Zobrist, Uribe or Ramirez is far more likely and beneficial."
buccos,3e22m2,Gameroomvids,2,Tue Jul 21 16:29:04 2015 UTC,I have no reason to believe Cespedes will cost anymore than what we gave the Mets for Marlon Byrd in 2013.

buccos,3e22m2,tonytroz,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:02:17 2015 UTC,I loved the idea of Price last year when he was under contract another year and we didn't think we'd have AJ and Liriano back.  Not so much this year.  He'd be a sure-fire rental and would definitely cost a top prospect.  I don't think it's worth it.
buccos,3e22m2,PhantomJB93,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:49:53 2015 UTC,"Polanco could be a trade piece. Maybe not for Cespedes or Price, but for someone like Brett Lawrie or a pitcher with more control. Also, any chance the Dodgers deal Puig? Maybe they could work something out with the Pirates..."
buccos,3e22m2,mtk180,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:25 2015 UTC,Puig is basically Tabata who is actually good.  I don't think he's available.

buccos,3e22m2,mtk180,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:37:39 2015 UTC,i'd say there is a -100% chance that Puig will be traded to anyone at the deadline.

buccos,3dzuq1,Dleeu2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:56:06 2015 UTC,I think it was because Neil walker is eligible for free agency this year I believe
buccos,3dzuq1,Pittsburgh_Pirates,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:50:01 2015 UTC,Neil Walker isn't eligible for free agency until after the 2016 season.
buccos,3dzuq1,pghgamecock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:50:10 2015 UTC,It was because he was inconsistent at Short. I don't think it had anything to do Walker.
buccos,3dzuq1,maltrab,3,Mon Jul 20 23:27:31 2015 UTC,"It's a combination of both. If Walker wasn't a long term plan, they wouldn't put a great prospect at 2nd who didn't have a chance to start in the near future. They would have kept him at SS and worked through the pain. A lot of major league shortstops have growing pains. Troy Tulowitzki had 25 errors in the minors the year he got called up to the major league roster. Clint Barmes, who is one of the best defensive shortstops/infielders of the past decade had a ton of defensive problems in AA and AAA."
buccos,3dzuq1,IamNotYourBuddy,4,Tue Jul 21 12:47:37 2015 UTC,"My thoughts:  This is very interesting and seems different to how we're used to seeing Neal and the front office operate.  Neal has never struck me as the most reactionary guy -- he generally sticks with his plans which can often be slow and deliberate,  and there's been very few (if ever) times where he's done something extreme with a legitimate prospect to accelerate him to meet a need in the majors.  So that's why this is quite against the grain. It's nice to see."
buccos,3dzuq1,wbaumbeck,3,Mon Jul 20 21:39:23 2015 UTC,"True but maybe the internal position on Hansen is that he is ready but just doesn't have a starting spot on the roster yet and that mercer going down opened one up for him. It's actually the only thing that makes sense to me as, like you said, nh is not the reactionary type at all"
buccos,3dzuq1,stealthycanadian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:28:04 2015 UTC,Some people are saying he could be called up within the next couple of weeks which would be very different.
buccos,3dzuq1,jedwar05,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:46:01 2015 UTC,"NH also said this was the plan for Hanson all along (at least recently), the injury to Mercer just sped up the process. Either way, it will be nice for Hanson to offer positional flexibility and hopefully the bat can play in the bigs. I say give it two weeks or so and he should be up."
buccos,3dzuq1,Dr_ButtToucher_PhD,2,Tue Jul 21 01:12:14 2015 UTC,"Also, it's important to think of the opportunity cost of this situation. If we do indeed see Hanson as a solution at third base, we likely wouldn't be in the market to acquire a rental 3B, which means we wouldn't have to devote prospects towards such a trade. Furthermore, we could devote those potential prospects as part of a more needed trade, like for a first baseman."
buccos,3dzuq1,wbaumbeck,0,Mon Jul 20 22:05:50 2015 UTC,"Does this open the door for a more realistic possibility of working a deal with Walker? He's not having as good of a year this year so maybe they can ""buy low"" in a sense."
buccos,3dzuq1,Dr_ButtToucher_PhD,9,Mon Jul 20 22:53:20 2015 UTC,"walker is not signing a long term deal with Pittsburgh, plain and simple. It just doesn't make sense from either side.   On his end he is going to want to cash in as much as possible (i.e. Hit the open market) he's only gonna have one chance to do that as he will already be 30 by that time, effecively eliminating any possibility of a short term deal with the pirates.   From the Pirates end why should they want to pay market rate for a second baseman with limited range and a bad back when he will in all likelyhood severely decline over the life of said contract.   It doesn't make sense from either side and walker will walk after next year or be traded in the offseason, which I think is the more likely scenario. It will probably result in some bad pr for both especially the Pirates as they will look cheap and it will be right up the haters (mark madden and the like) alley. But it would be a mistake to sign walker to a long term deal because of the reasons outlined and also because of their depth with both Harrison and Hansen being able to play their long term"
buccos,3dzuq1,tonytroz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:24:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of that. But Hansen has never even seen a major league pitch and as good of a story as Harrison is, I still have my doubts of him being a long term every day solution."
buccos,3dzuq1,tonytroz,3,Mon Jul 20 23:28:40 2015 UTC,"and as good of a story as Harrison is, I still have my doubts of him being a long term every day solution.   He followed up an all-star season with a .280 first half, and that includes a .213 April. He's been batting over .300 ever since. I think it's time to give up the ""not an every day player"" talk. They didn't just give him a $45M deal because of one season."
buccos,3dzuq1,Dleeu2,0,Tue Jul 21 01:25:38 2015 UTC,"Your points are solid, but I wouldn't completely rule out the ""hometown discount""."

Heck, even Pujols said he would have taken less money to stay in St. Louis if they could come close to LAA.  It's getting more rare at this point, but it still happens. Liriano took a discount to stay here in Pittsburgh as well."

buccos,3dzuq1,jmb_412,2,Tue Jul 21 13:51:42 2015 UTC,"Walker is not coming back. In an extension, we would be getting him on the wrong side of age 30. Why would a team that works with a tight budget spend millions of dollars on a player in his 30s when there is a pretty good prospect ready to take his spot? Walker's history of back problems and his terrible defense (which thankfully is being hidden because we shift a lot) make him far from a good extension candidate.  I'd rather them spend that money elsewhere. Use it to get another starter."

It's great they'll both be back for the playoff run at least.   I could see us bringing back our old friend Clint Barmes.   No. Appreciate what the guy did here but he's not even remotely an upgrade for the Pirates. Kang to SS, get a 3B with power. Last thing the Pirates need is a defensive specialist in the lineup. The pitching is carrying the defense and the Pirates swept because they couldn't hit the third worst pitching staff in the league."
buccos,3dzct1,tonytroz,4,Mon Jul 20 20:21:07 2015 UTC,"If it makes you feel better, you missed our worst two pitchers (Garza/ Lohse), Jungmann is a rookie who has only recently been called up, and Fiers is very hot right now.

buccos,3dzct1,MoreThanWards,3,Mon Jul 20 20:22:52 2015 UTC,"I mentioned Aramis Ramirez in another thread, only problem is his average dropped considerably this season and he's not great defensively so it wouldn't be much different than moving Pedro back to 3B. There are definitely better options available at 1B."
buccos,3dzct1,tonytroz,5,Mon Jul 20 20:34:21 2015 UTC,"Aram has actually been quite strong defensively. I know this is not the entire tale, but it does show good for Aram."
buccos,3dzct1,theamazingkiwi,4,Mon Jul 20 20:59:37 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Baseball Reference has him as a -0.4, but I believe the difference is they use a position adjustment.

buccos,3dzct1,tonytroz,4,Mon Jul 20 21:03:47 2015 UTC,"Just letting you know now he still hits those, only now he is slower."
buccos,3dzct1,theamazingkiwi,2,Mon Jul 20 21:10:12 2015 UTC,He's got the same amount of them as home runs and almost half as many K's as Pedro. I'll take it!
buccos,3dzct1,tonytroz,3,Mon Jul 20 21:15:48 2015 UTC,"Aramis also had his traditional slow start because he's old, but his bat has been getting much better lately.  He's hitting .378 so far this month.  For what it's worth."

buccos,3dzct1,MoreThanWards,0,Mon Jul 20 20:57:54 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind bringing in a defensive specialist at shortstop. It's the most important defensive position on the field, and it wouldn't be the worst thing bringing in a sure-handed glove like Barmes in the end of games, like we do with SRod for Pedro."
buccos,3dzct1,tonytroz,3,Mon Jul 20 20:24:37 2015 UTC,"Kang has been flashing his glove all year, albeit mostly at 3B. Mercer will also be back to the playoffs. No reason to waste a bench spot for another infielder for 6 weeks."
buccos,3dzct1,mtk180,4,Mon Jul 20 20:31:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's much of a waste. Say we did acquire another shortstop, and then Mercer came back in September. At that point, you've got roster expansion."
buccos,3dzct1,mcurl67,2,Mon Jul 20 21:22:35 2015 UTC,6 weeks is a significant percentage of the remaining season and the Cards keep winning. We can't afford to blow games because they were unwilling to upgrade at the deadline to help out while Mercer is injured.
buccos,3dzct1,jmb_412,0,Mon Jul 20 21:59:32 2015 UTC,"Barmes is good against lefties. He would definitely add offensive value to this team against them. His career splits against them are like .272/.331/.443, and he's better than that this year in limited abs. Not sure how is d is anymore, or whether the Pirates would want to shuffle Kang around to allow Barmes to play SS against lefties, but that would make the team better offensively."
buccos,3dzct1,jmb_412,4,Tue Jul 21 15:08:38 2015 UTC,"Pirates have a shortstop in Kang. What they need is a 3B with Harrison out. Also, I don't understand the reasoning in the Pirates being interested in Upton. Sending Polanco down isn't going to help him.

buccos,3dzct1,Monahan_424,3,Mon Jul 20 20:03:54 2015 UTC,I don't think it would send Polanco down. Just make him a 4th OF.
buccos,3dzct1,drunkenviking,6,Mon Jul 20 20:05:27 2015 UTC,Which won't help him because he'll get less at bats. Terrible idea
buccos,3dzct1,Monahan_424,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:07:56 2015 UTC,Apparently Hurdle sat Polanco down and asked him if he's worried about being sent down because it wasn't going to happen.

buccos,3dzct1,jmb_412,3,Tue Jul 21 04:54:08 2015 UTC,"I heard it on one of the radio shows on 93.7 the fan. Hurdle told him he will not go down and it isn't something he has to worry about. Shortly after I heard that, Polanco got go-ahead hits in back to back nights against the Padres and the walk off against the Cards. I also heard on one of those shows that Huntington never even had a discussion with anyone about sending him down."
buccos,3dzct1,tonytroz,4,Tue Jul 21 05:05:04 2015 UTC,"Also, I don't understand the reasoning in the Pirates being interested in Upton. Sending Polanco down isn't going to help him.   This isn't about helping Polanco, it's about winning games. .240/.318/.344 vs. Upton's .252/.331/.426. He also has the same amount of SB as Polanco. It's an upgrade all around, Polanco moves to the bench and becomes a great option there. Sucks for his development but you have to bat better than .240 on a World Series contender. He'll be back in the full time RF role next year for another go."
buccos,3dzct1,pghgamecock,3,Mon Jul 20 20:18:19 2015 UTC,"You know how much Upton will cost though, right? If this was a multiple year thing, I wouldn't have a problem because I do enjoy Upton, but because it's a rental thing, is it really worth it?"
buccos,3dzct1,Doublehalfpint,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:20:15 2015 UTC,"Expensive for sure. I'd really hate to see them lose Bell, Meadows, Glasnow, Taillon, or McGuire for a rental. If they could get him for other prospects I'd absolutely consider it though."
buccos,3dzct1,borski88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:36:46 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, since it's a rental thing it might be easier to get him. I imagine that Upton for multiple years would require a shit-ton of prospects. Just as a rental, the Pads might be willing to trade him for whatever they can get.  Not saying I want to get him, but Upton being a rental could help the Pirates get him without having to sell the farm."
buccos,3dzct1,Doublehalfpint,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:58:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I don't get the interest in Upton either. I wouldn't do a damn thing to Polanco after the July he is having. The kid is playing the good ball that his raw skill should suggest. From July 1 to July 20, he is .288/.400/.407. I personally am willing to gamble that Polanco keeps hitting, and that the outfielders stay healthy. Getting another outfielder would not make enough of an impact for the price they would pay for an Upton. Pirates' front office would never make that kind of move."
buccos,3dzct1,MoreThanWards,2,Tue Jul 21 14:11:47 2015 UTC,I like the idea of getting Zoberist
buccos,3dzct1,tonytroz,3,Mon Jul 20 20:04:14 2015 UTC,"To me, this seems like the most likely target for the FO. As others have said though, it will be very dependent on price."
buccos,3dzct1,mtk180,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:13:35 2015 UTC,I also like Zobrist. If I were Neil I'd be on him like flies on shit.  I think this is the year we may see one or (hopefully not) two of our big prospect chips traded. I just hope to hell we don't trade Tallion.   Edit: I meant Glasnow. Not Tallion.
buccos,3dzct1,MoreThanWards,8,Mon Jul 20 20:25:01 2015 UTC,"I just hope to hell we don't trade Tallion.   If we're going to trade a pitcher I'd much rather trade Taillon over Glasnow. Glasnow is still on track to be an ace, Taillon's projection has been dropping since they drafted him. Still wouldn't mind seeing both on the roster late next year though. You can never have too much pitching.  I think Meadows is the most likely candidate to be traded. Glasnow is too valuable with Burnett retiring, Taillon's value is way down, the Pirates desperately need Josh Bell to replace Pedro, and McGuire is the long term catching replacement since Tony Sanchez didn't pan out.  Meadows could be a great replacement for Cutch if he chases the money, but that's potentially 2019, and with Marte and Polanco there already he'll probably never see the field until then."
buccos,3dzct1,tonytroz,2,Mon Jul 20 21:13:23 2015 UTC,"Apparently though, The A's want AAA guys, not lower minors guys. So getting Zobrist might cost Hanson or Taillon plus another guys, so I'd be interested to see how that one would work out. Might not be the best fit."
buccos,3dzct1,Rorbotron,2,Mon Jul 20 22:02:57 2015 UTC,I actually meant to say Glasnow. I wouldn't mind if we traded Tallion at all at this point.
buccos,3dzct1,tonytroz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:03:49 2015 UTC,I would rather it be Kingham.
buccos,3dzct1,Rorbotron,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:03:18 2015 UTC,I don't think any team would take an injured prospect. It's extremely rare.
buccos,3dzct1,The_Arcadian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:34:47 2015 UTC,I would be shocked with Cutch chases the money.  Absolutely shocked.
buccos,3dzct1,Rorbotron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:22:51 2015 UTC,"It's tough because it's going to be a similar situation to Russell Martin. The Yankees/Red Sox/Cubs will offer him 5 years/$125M. Even if he wants to stay and the Pirates want to keep them, paying a guy $25M when he's in his mid-30s is just something the Buccos can't afford to do. It's also enough money that it's nearly impossible to turn it down no matter how much you want to stay."
buccos,3dzct1,The_Arcadian,5,Tue Jul 21 03:31:54 2015 UTC,"Hell I could be wrong and maybe I'm WAAAAY too sentimental with certain pro athletes in the Burgh but Cutch WAS the turnaround with this team.  He signed and the team started turning around.  The Pirates then became a desirable destination.  Sure I could see someone offering him a ridiculous amount of money but I don't know that we'll ever see it be tempting.  I could see him just signing extensions until he retires.  Burnett took a big pay cut to come back, I think Cutch rides it out as a bucco for life.  I guess we'll find out someday, I'm just glad it's someday and not soon :)"
buccos,3dzct1,Rorbotron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:01:07 2015 UTC,Burnett also got his huge contract. Cutch has been payed well below his value for almost his entire career. I can't see one of the games best players going his entire career without getting a market value contract.
buccos,3dzct1,drunkenviking,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:35 2015 UTC,I also can't see the Pirates letting him go and with the contracts in baseball what IS market value?  He could have signed for more when we signed him the first time.  He is the pirates and our team is different.  There is a brotherly bond there I believe few teams in professional sports have and guys that come in from the outside feel it immediately.  Either way I will be shocked if he finishes his career somewhere else.  If he's terrible with his money (I doubt it) who knows but he could live in the lap of luxury for the rest of his life with the contract he's already signed.  Professional athletes do exist that aren't allllllll about the biggest pay day possible.
buccos,3dzct1,Ohtoko,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:24:03 2015 UTC,"He'll be an UFA at the end of his age 31 season in 2018. I can't see the Pirates, as they operate now giving him 5/$125, let alone the kinds of contracts that Cano and Pujols signed. It would be pretty naive to think he could leave $100m+ on the table, I sure as hell wouldn't turn down a double salary for much of anything. Then again who knows, Nutting could break the bank for him, revenues could go through the roof, the Bucs could win a series or two, we've got at least three more seasons of him, lets enjoy it."
buccos,3dzct1,MoreThanWards,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:19 2015 UTC,"Totly agree and I plan to enjoy it.  However there have been a bunch of top tier athletes that sign home town discount style contracts.  We lost for 20 years and Cutch has been a huge boon for the turnaround.  As I said before maybe I'm too sentimental BUT when a team has created the kind of bond that exists in PNC, the guy that ""made the glue"" so to speak leaving would be pretty shocking.  Baseball and the lack of salary cap allows for ridiculous deals but that doesn't mean ball players are all out there looking to sign those enormous contracts to play for a team that doesn't feel like ""home"".  Either way let's enjoy it but I think we will be enjoying him until he retires."
buccos,3dzct1,Ohtoko,2,Tue Jul 21 18:07:13 2015 UTC,"I think the thing with Cutch though is that he knows he'll have a legacy here if he is a lifer. If he takes the payday and puts on pin stripes, he'll get his big bucks, and a hall of fame plaque. If he stays here, he gets less money, a hall of fame plaque, ""Andrew McCutchen Field"" or two,  a street named after him, number 22 retired, and a bronze statute staring back at Pops. I think he might value that more.   But if he takes the money and runs, I wouldn't fault him for a second, and I'd still wear his jersey proudly."

buccos,3dzct1,mcurl67,4,Mon Jul 20 19:45:25 2015 UTC,As I said in my post... my only caveat: Be realistic.  We both know Tulo isn't realistic. He's under control through 2021 and would cost the farm. That ain't happening.
buccos,3dzct1,bengraz13,0,Mon Jul 20 19:50:32 2015 UTC,"well i'm not sure what he would cost, only the rookies do i imagine.  but if he's on the block then it is at least somewhat realistic.  having him under that much control would be great too.    i'd be shocked if Hunnington didn't at least put forth a bit of effort to inquire and check costs on players like him and Abreu.  The cost might be astronomical and not worth it but that doesn't mean you don't ask."

Eventually The Guy stopped to look over the trail railing and I gained some ground on him. A little while later he stopped again, this time climbed up on the railing and leaning over. I get like 5 yards away and notice up ahead a girl and woman are heading my way on bikes so I shorten the dogs leash and step off the trail because the dog is big and kind of intimidating.   The bikers pull off the trail beside The Guy and WHAT DOES HE SAY TO THE KID? ""Hey kiddo!"" That's what he says, and then he hugged the woman and kissed the kid's head.

The Buccos desperately need power but a .250 guy isn't much better than Pedro and he also has a negative dWAR.  At this point, I think the Pirates should consider going after a righty 1B with power. Move Pedro back to 3B until J-Hay gets back, then platoon him. Pedro's dWAR at 1B this season is -1.6, much worse than his -0.5 at 3B last year."

buccos,3dvegn,wbaumbeck,8,Sun Jul 19 21:10:25 2015 UTC,"This one is on hurdle, we needed to avoid the sweep and he sent out the b squad. No reason clutch shouldn't be out there when he had the whole week (minus a few innings in the asg) off.   Also he one again sticks with Locke too long, don't get me wrong he has pitched  really well lately but he should have had the hook on him as soon as they had 1st and 2nd in the seventh, but hurdle doesn't even have anyone warming at that point. Anyone with eyeballs could see we were gonna have to win 1-0 with the way the offend  was going, you have to manage way tighter  in that position and let you bullpen throw up a couple zeros to get  you the W. But instead he sticks with Locke we go down on the next battle  and the ballgame was  effectively over.  Don't get me wrong it's a bad weekend not the harbinger  if doom but man it would have really been nice to avoid the brooms today."
buccos,3dvegn,bobosaurs2,5,Sun Jul 19 21:24:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean I don't disagree with sending Locke out there again, but you've gotta have a shorter leash there. The offense has been putrid. They should have to walk to KC"

buccos,3dvegn,tonytroz,2,Sun Jul 19 22:00:58 2015 UTC,"The Mercer injury might force Huntington's hand now. All signs are pointing to it being serious.  Curious to see what others think the right move is. Kang to SS seems like a given unless we see Hanson called up? He's batting .283 in AAA this season and seems to be fine after his broken pinky last month. Other option would be to trade for a 3B, or alternatively a 1B and move Pedro back to third (RIP fans behind first).  I was fine with the Buccos merely making a small move for a bench guy, but now I think they have to make a splash for a corner infielder in the next two weeks, preferably before the Nationals series. The division race might be over heading into August if they keep playing like this."
buccos,3dvegn,borski88,2,Mon Jul 20 00:40:30 2015 UTC,"Or trade Pedro, though I don't know how much value he has.  Great potential. but he has mediocre offensive production and makes too many defensive errors.  I would rather have a mediocre production offensive 1B that doesn't commit the errors."

buccos,3du1q9,witzelsuchty,5,Sun Jul 19 18:08:12 2015 UTC,"I realize we're sticking to the normal rotation schedule, but why aren't we going with Cole today? His last start was 9 days ago, and I can't imagine 18 pitches on Tuesday did anything for him. We're on the verge of getting swept by the Brewers. And in addition, the sooner we can use our top of the rotation, the better chance they have at getting an additional start by the end of the season. Doesn't the Break allow you a chance at restarting your rotation?"
buccos,3du1q9,mcmiler436,5,Sun Jul 19 14:59:02 2015 UTC,In the past we have always reset the rotation. This time around Hurdle has stated he didn't want Morton and Locke to go too long without pitching. His reason for delaying Cole and Burnett was Cole pitched in the all star game and AJ has pitched a ton of innings in the first half.

Like the explosive, full lineup offense on Friday? The Pirates need offensive help ASAP. Brewers have the third worst pitching staff in the league plus nothing to play for and they can't do anything. Heck, even two of their runs yesterday came via a wild pitch and an error. Meanwhile the Cards have a good chance to sweep the Mets who are in the playoff hunt.

buccos,3du1q9,witzelsuchty,8,Sun Jul 19 19:36:44 2015 UTC,Between the eyebrows. Subtle and tasteful.
buccos,3du1q9,witzelsuchty,4,Sun Jul 19 19:39:27 2015 UTC,It'd be like a unibrow but better!
buccos,3du1q9,OHVespista,2,Sun Jul 19 19:40:32 2015 UTC,"That's the tricky part. I want to be able to hide it, but I want to be able to show it off too. My plan for an earlier idea was behind my ear but i don't want to go that small. Maybe the back of my neck, I'm not sure."
buccos,3du1q9,witzelsuchty,2,Sun Jul 19 19:39:55 2015 UTC,"Back of the neck would work. You could easily hide it under your hair, but it'd still be placed in such a way that it's easy for you to show off."
buccos,3du1q9,kmhokies35,2,Sun Jul 19 19:41:59 2015 UTC,That's the top contender right now. My head is too big to have really short hair so it'll always be long enough to hide it.
buccos,3du1q9,unoriginalRambone,4,Sun Jul 19 19:45:36 2015 UTC,Do it on the back of your thigh. Just about the knee pit.
buccos,3du1q9,purplepenned,2,Sun Jul 19 19:48:35 2015 UTC,"I wear shorts a lot at work, while my current boss wouldn't care much I'm not sure about down the line  Knee pit made me laugh though."
buccos,3du1q9,unoriginalRambone,2,Sun Jul 19 19:55:21 2015 UTC,The wife's first tattoo was on the back of her neck. It's a good spot. From what she says the pain wasn't too bad.
buccos,3du1q9,purplepenned,2,Sun Jul 19 19:47:55 2015 UTC,That's good to hear. I have a pretty high pain tolerance but it still worries me.
buccos,3du1q9,Baytee,2,Sun Jul 19 19:56:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, unless it's on your ribs or your elbows, any pain you'd have is pretty minimal."
buccos,3du1q9,fishbulb00,2,Sun Jul 19 19:57:09 2015 UTC,Definitely avoiding both of those areas.
buccos,3du1q9,stich09,3,Sun Jul 19 20:03:47 2015 UTC,That is a pretty spectacular idea.

buccos,3du1q9,PhantomJB93,3,Sun Jul 19 20:55:47 2015 UTC,http://i.imgur.com/iWKad22.jpg?fb
buccos,3du1q9,reggiecide,13,Sun Jul 19 20:56:07 2015 UTC,"What a dirty play. So far away from the bag, no excuse for that."
buccos,3du1q9,PhantomJB93,13,Sun Jul 19 18:39:33 2015 UTC,"If you're Gomez, you try to break up the double play.  If you're close to the bag, that means a hard slide.  If you're dead to rights like Gomez there, it usually means slowing down to delay the tag.  Was the play intentionally dirty?  Possibly but there's no way to definitively say that.  It's entirely possible Gomez,  thinking that Mercer would flip it to 2nd, got confused between his two options and slid. Many, myself included, won't give the runner the benefit of the doubt just because it was Gomez, who has shown himself to be a bit of a dick over the years."
buccos,3du1q9,witzelsuchty,9,Sun Jul 19 18:43:53 2015 UTC,Most others would stop. Gomez is going to go all out and I agree he probably got caught between two minds here.
buccos,3du1q9,PhantomJB93,6,Sun Jul 19 18:55:59 2015 UTC,after my emotions cleared I realized this was a good point. I don't want this to escalate.
buccos,3du1q9,reggiecide,5,Sun Jul 19 18:48:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah Gomez always plays his hardest, I'm sure he wasn't intentionally trying to do that"
buccos,3du1q9,Novowelsnomercy,7,Sun Jul 19 20:05:23 2015 UTC,Should that be an automatic double play? The slide wasn't close to the base.
buccos,3du1q9,unoriginalRambone,8,Sun Jul 19 18:38:04 2015 UTC,"Nowhere near the bag, swinging his legs to the right. Garbage. There needs to be punishment/suspension for trying that kind of crap."
buccos,3du1q9,OHVespista,2,Sun Jul 19 18:36:41 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you, it'd be hell to prove it was done intentionally."
buccos,3du1q9,purplepenned,4,Sun Jul 19 18:37:39 2015 UTC,"What a great lineup.  Rodriguez, Ishikawa, Decker all out there.  Good Lord Hurdle."
buccos,3du1q9,witzelsuchty,2,Sun Jul 19 18:39:07 2015 UTC,You say that like some of our regulars are doing any better.
buccos,3du1q9,kmhokies35,4,Sun Jul 19 18:40:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Pedro -> Ishikawa is more a lateral move at this point."
buccos,3du1q9,Cardozos,4,Sun Jul 19 18:42:52 2015 UTC,"Our 5, 7, and 9 hitters have 3 hits.  This season.  Combined.  2 of those three hits are from the pitcher.  Half of this lineup is a complete black hole and it was easily avoidable."
buccos,3du1q9,sdogg,2,Sun Jul 19 18:47:05 2015 UTC,Sean Rod hasn't been doing bad
buccos,3du1q9,witzelsuchty,2,Sun Jul 19 18:42:26 2015 UTC,"I don't mind him off the bench, but it really, really sucks when he is the 6th best hitter in your lineup.  This is why you should never bench more than 1 starter at a time.  All of a sudden you could have another one go down like Jordy and be forced into a situation where you're fielding a AA team because of your stupid management decisions."
buccos,3du1q9,purplepenned,4,Sun Jul 19 18:50:25 2015 UTC,Things you didn't expect to hear today: Locke drives in Decker!

Against the rest of the majors, the Pirates are 17-7 on the road.  6 of those 13 loses came early in the season when they were swept by the Reds and Cardinals. The Pirates as a team got off to a slow start. Outside of those 2 sweeps, the Pirates were 4-7, not great, but not horrid. Before this last Cardinals series, the Pirates were 14-22. Even if you don't the early season sweeps, it still isn't a divisional record you'd expect from a playoff caliber team. The large amount of divisional games the Pirates have to finish the season is what is going to keep them from winning the division if they keep this poor divisional play up. They seem to do great against non-divisional teams, 36-12, which is a winning percentage of .750."
buccos,3dsrkr,IamNotYourBuddy,8,Sun Jul 19 08:22:48 2015 UTC,Ridiculous that were letting the Brewers walk all over us after what happened just a week ago. Hopefully Locke & The Bats can prevent a sweep tomorrow.

But the last time I did a lot of baking, I ended up having to make the icing by hang because my mixer (my hand mixer, that is) broke mid-recipe. This is a recipe I vow to get to eventually. And this sup will be the first to know, I promise"
buccos,3dsrkr,Nude_Gingrich,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:58:13 2015 UTC,Why would Gin and Tonic be in two separate refrigerators?? That makes no sense. My gin basically comes with a sidecar of tonic.
buccos,3dsrkr,bucsfan67,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:29:28 2015 UTC,"This is a valid question. The gin is from awhile back when I took a trip up to the Canadian side of Niagara Falls. Picked up a couple of Liter bottles of Tanqueray for $11 apiece. Drank one up there and saved the other for the summer. Came down here to Virginia, knowing nobody. I don't usually enjoy drinking alone so I didn't really touch it much.  Enter today. One roommate out working overtime at the fire dept. The other out god knows where. Me feeling lazy and wanting to drink. I have a bottle of gin in my room, but nothing else.  Enter Wegmans: I go there, pick up a bomber of a beer I haven't had, pick up a bottle of tonic water, pick up a half pound of gummy worms, pick up dinner. In that order, going by importance. Bring all home.  I get home, put the tonic and the beer in the fridge. Dig into dinner, a sub from the cafe section. Delicious. Only eat half so I can eat the rest later. Open up bomber. Drink bomber while watching Orioles game on tv and watching Pirates GDT here on reddit. Finish bomber. Still comfy on chair. Pose question to reddit.  Before you posted: Find cooler in bedroom after running up and down stairs multiple times trying to find the best solution. Ate some gummy worms in that time period. Finally find a cooler in my bedroom. Put bottle of gin in cooler. Run downstairs and fill cooler with ice. Put bottle of tonic on top of ice. Zip cooler. Run back upstairs. Look for something to watch. Get stuck between the next episode of Aquarius and Nightcrawler on Netflix. Decide to check reddit while deciding. Type this message. Hi."

Why the hell do they keep calling up people with no track record whatsoever who will inevitably hit .120 and be sent down in 2 weeks? I know, Tabata's .270 is an empty .270.... but an empty .270 is better than the absolute shit we've gotten from guys like Gorkys, Decker, and Lombardozzi."
buccos,3dnyg2,pghgamecock,6,Fri Jul 17 21:00:20 2015 UTC,"I keep hearing that they think Tabata is a ""bad influence"" on Marte/Polanco.  If so, whatever, I guess I can understand not wanting him in the clubhouse.  What I can't understand is keeping him in our minor league system when he is obviously the best option for our bench.  He's literally exactly what they keep saying they are looking for (outfielder who can hit for average and play CF defensively in a pinch).  If you're not even going to turn to him over freaking Gorkys and Ishikawa, just trade him already."
buccos,3dnyg2,PhantomJB93,3,Sat Jul 18 00:13:36 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they'd love to trade him but he has a pretty high contract that I'm sure no one wants. I'm pretty sure he cleared waivers last year, so no one wanted to take him on for literally nothing."

buccos,3dnyg2,witzelsuchty,4,Sat Jul 18 12:45:16 2015 UTC,"These are grown men, some of which drafted out of high school and have never been in the real world really. Polanco himself joined the Pirates at 17.   The bad influence part would be what I assume is Tabata hanging out with him all the time and getting him to not practice as much, goof off more, staying up partying, etc. Sure you can argue that Polanco needs to man up and not be influenced by class clown Tabata, but that doesn't mean he will. He could be incredibly immature for all we know. Just because these players are adults and make a lot of money doesn't mean they don't have their own issues. One thing I wish people payed more attention to in sports is the psychology of the players. We like to think they are robots, and nothing outside of the sport distracts them, and everything is in a vacuum. Well it isn't. Players have personalities, they have personal problems, they have feelings."

buccos,3dnfiy,Pizzaplan3tman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:04:20 2015 UTC,"I think they pull the trigger on Hamels because both Taillon and Kingham, the two starters who were closest to the majors have suffered injuries (both Tommy John, Taillon last year and Kingham this year). One or both may not be the same ever again.  I also think Hamels will be good into his mid to late thirties. Will he be dominant? no. Will he be a steady number 3 after cole and glasnow? yes. But the thing is we will be overpaying for a good third starter.  I think the only untouchable prospects should be Glasnow, Bell and Hanson because they fill roles in the near future. This leaves players like Meadows and Harold Ramirez to work with.  If not Hamels, then I like Kazmir or if the Tigers tank in the next month, Price would be a good rental."
buccos,3dnfiy,jayond,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:20:20 2015 UTC,"We did have interest in Price before, I think he is signed to a long term deal though for a few years?"
buccos,3dnfiy,xSincosx,-1,Sun Jul 19 00:30:42 2015 UTC,"Chapman and Cueto would be interesting. Chapman for the 7th. Cueto for the 4th starter. Obviously, this will never happen. It would just be fun to have them on our side for once."
buccos,3dnfiy,jayond,8,Fri Jul 17 23:10:02 2015 UTC,Chapman for the 7th? Are you insane? Have you ever watched him pitch ever?
buccos,3dnfiy,xSincosx,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:45:50 2015 UTC,I'm not sure which way you are going here. His issues with control don't seem to be a problem anymore and don't think Watson or Melancon should be moved from where they are right now. I thought bring a 100 mile + hour fastball would be cool to setup Watson and then Melancon. Please enlighten me. I don't watch the Reds that often.
buccos,3dnfiy,tonytroz,6,Sat Jul 18 07:20:56 2015 UTC,Chapman is better than Melancon and Watson.
buccos,3dnfiy,jayond,2,Sat Jul 18 15:33:35 2015 UTC,"This. He's the best closer in the game. Watson is having a down year by his standards. Melancon is obviously having a great year but same as the previous years: what happens when he has to actually close against good teams instead of padding his stats against bad ones?  The Buccos would never shell out top prospects for him so the point is moot, but you'd be crazy to choose Melancon over Chapman."
buccos,3dnfiy,grasspuddle,2,Sat Jul 18 16:12:19 2015 UTC,It's a moot point probably. We aren't going to rent Chapman.
buccos,3dnfiy,jayond,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:31:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i could dig those 2. Reds would want too much for that deal."

buccos,3dmjw5,mtk180,9,Fri Jul 17 19:02:19 2015 UTC,"I'm so confused by our pitching schedule... Chuck today, Frank tmr, then Locke Sunday? Then what! Cole, AJ, then Morton or does it go back to Liriano?"
buccos,3dmjw5,BITW92,13,Fri Jul 17 15:04:50 2015 UTC,Methinks they're setting it up so we have Cole/Burnett squaring off against Scherzer/Gio in the Washington series and Cueto/Leake against Cincy.
buccos,3dmjw5,bucsfan67,3,Fri Jul 17 15:11:49 2015 UTC,"Morton has pitched the least recently of our standard starters, Locke is being skipped whenever possible, and Cole/Burnett get skipped due to the ASG, so it comes back to Liriano on 6 days rest.   I'd expect Cole to start on Sunday, followed by Burnett, then a Locke start or giving someone else a chance, then back to the normal rotation with Morton/Liriano/Cole/Burnett/PlayerToBeNamedLater"

Home stand against the Cubs and Dodgers, then on the road at the Cardinals and Mets.  The stretch from August 24-September 3 will be really nice. At Miami, home vs. Colorado, and at Milwaukee.

He's not going to come cheap in terms of players/prospects in a trade.  He's already making $4.1M & has 2 more arbitration years of control, so it'd be a stretch to say they'd let that money sit on the bench (Kang is a different story). If he wasn't on the bench, that would mean they'd have to demote/trade/give up on Polonco, which they don't really seem inclined to do (and for good reason).   Am I missing something here?"

buccos,3dl1g7,AaadamPgh,2,Fri Jul 17 12:42:14 2015 UTC,"I won't say you're missing anything, but I think your points are overblown.   Gregory Polanco is our RF. End of story. He won't be going anywhere, will not get demoted, and they are not going to give up on him. Adding Revere would not hamper his development at all, it would be as a complementary piece. I think the money is becoming less and less of a worry for Pittsburgh. The payroll is increasing every year and it's not uncommon for other teams to have a $4-6M/yr player not playing every day. Huntington said he has been told he has payroll flexibility and adding somebody like Revere shouldn't be an issue. Don't think he will cost all that much in terms of prospects assuming we take full salary. A middling low B-level guy and a couple C guys should get it done. Revere isn't as much of an asset as Papelbon or Hamels (the sky is blue), and I think maybe something with Barrett Barnes or JaCoby Jones as the best player will work."
buccos,3dl1g7,jedwar05,2,Fri Jul 17 15:06:40 2015 UTC,"If we can get him for a decent price to be the 4th outfielder & the Bucs are willing to pay him, I'm all for it then."
buccos,3dl1g7,AaadamPgh,-2,Fri Jul 17 16:05:24 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go after Revere personally but...  Point 1> Probably cheaper than you would think.  I would say sending Polanco and a B or C prospect for Revere and Cash or PTBNL would be feaseable and reasonable. In other words, If i wanted revere i would find it acceptable.. if i wanted to get rid of revere i would find it acceptable.  Point 2> Revere's pay i smuch more than Polanco, for good reason.. he is currently better and will likely continue to get nice sized raises through out arbitration.  Revere would be the starting right fielder and lead off man not Polanco (if he was still on the team)  Point 3> Trade Polanco to get Revere.  OR use Polanco get get a full time first basemen or decent pitching depth.  I think in a year or so Polanco will be generally better than Revere, but Revere is more of a 'win now' option should the pirates want to go that route.    That said.. someone is going to offer way to much for Revere and the Pirates will not be that someone and that is Okay :-)"
buccos,3dl1g7,redrage97,6,Fri Jul 17 15:51:07 2015 UTC,Stop with this nonsense of getting rid of Polanco. Will not happen.
buccos,3dl1g7,jedwar05,-3,Fri Jul 17 16:22:32 2015 UTC,"Stop with the nonsense?  Never said it would but if you are getting Revere it makes sense to trade Polanco and get something useful.  That is unless you feel Polanco is never going to be more than our 4th OF..   I wouldn't do a Revere<->Polanco trade, but would understand it."
buccos,3dl1g7,redrage97,5,Fri Jul 17 16:34:49 2015 UTC,"It makes ZERO sense to get rid of Polanco. 23 year olds with his tools do not come around often. You're looking at a perennial .300-20-80 guy with 30 SB a year during his prime. What does Revere do? Run fast? Polanco does that too. Huntington would laugh anyone off the phone who offered up Polanco as a potential trade target.   My biggest problem with your ideas were trading Polanco PLUS a prospect for Revere. Out of 100, Polanco's trade value is about a 94 while Revere's is probably a 40-50. Just absolutely no way in hell you would swap those two."
buccos,3dl1g7,jedwar05,-2,Fri Jul 17 16:49:48 2015 UTC,"I will say it again because people are missing the point.  I wouldn't do this trade.   TL;DR: If you are going for ""WIN-NOW"" Revere over Polanco makes sense because he is a proven bat.  Here is what Revere does right now:  Fast, stolen base guy.  Proven lead off hitter.  Career .292 hitter  also decent fielder with little power.  is not BAD against lefties.  Here is what Polanco is doing NOW:  stealing bases and strikes out a lot.  Revere is at or near his prime a fast .300 hitter that will get on and score runs  and doesn't need to be subbed because he cannot hit lefties.  He has done it for years.. you can expect similar.  Polanco is young and may never find his groove.  You and I are pretty sure he will be that .300, 20 hr hitter with 30-40 SBs but, not a sure thing.  regardless he has too much talent to be sitting on the bench as a 4th out fielder for the next few years.  You trade him and get something you can use IF (big if) you trade for Revere.  EDIT IMO People are under valuing Revere and over valuing Polanco"
buccos,3dl1g7,redrage97,6,Fri Jul 17 17:13:46 2015 UTC,"I guess we can just agree to disagree. Revere will not be more valuable than Polanco this year, next year, the next five years. Maybe Revere over Polanco against some lefties would help the tiniest bit, but nothing that causes an extra win or anything. GP is gaining confidence by the day and showing much better appearances the last few weeks. Nobody would make the trade, in the matter that it wouldn't even be feasible for Huntington. You just do not trade away the star potential of six years of GP for a Revere type player. You trade away minors depth for that type of guy. Again, not opposed to acquiring Revere, but he would be a 4th OF for us."
buccos,3dl1g7,jedwar05,-1,Fri Jul 17 17:37:38 2015 UTC,"never agree to disagree it is an insult in disguise.  We actually Agree to Agree.. don't trade Polanco :-)  I will even go farther and say don't trade for Revere :-)  I'm just saying that Polanco would be the odd man out if they did because right now and probably next year too Revere is superior and fits team needs better.  You are seriously under valuing Revere.  He is a star.  a .300 hitter good glove, lots of stolen bases..  he lead the NL in hits last year and is up there again so far this year too.  Revere would be the lead off hitter we've been looking for.  Revere would not be the 4th OF he would be starting  I also think you are seriously over valuing Polanco.  you are saying he is going to be like Cutch and maybe even Marte.  He is not.  Good yeah sure but a .310 30/30 I really don't think so. But he is not going to get good by sitting on the Bench as the 4th OF, so If you get Revere you trade Polanco and get something you need ( like a first basemen ) or send him back to AAA with all the other OF prospects fighting for playing time."
buccos,3dl1g7,redrage97,2,Fri Jul 17 18:29:00 2015 UTC,"Here's what it comes down to: Acquiring Revere and trading Polanco is NOT a zero sum game. Just because one happens doesn't mean the other will too as a result. I AM a fan of acquiring Revere, but he is what he is. A light hitting, low on base guy that is super quick. For us, a 4th OF and a great replacement in case of injury. He can pinch run late in the game. Sure he led the league in hits...with 184. The lowest league leading number in the modern era. More a credit to everyone else than him. He doesn't walk (doesn't K much to his credit as well) and would not be a guy that we need to drive in runs like Polanco can be. There are no tradable assets on the market that are worth giving up Polanco for. He can, and WILL BE, a star. You just have to give him some time to develop."
buccos,3dl1g7,jedwar05,-1,Fri Jul 17 19:25:57 2015 UTC,You are still under valuing Revere.  Revere is a hits machine with a decent on base percentage NOT a low OBP.  Yeah its not .400 but its better than all the pirates starters except 'Cutch and Walker.  He hardly never strikes out and hardly ever walks he is a contact batter who gets singles and triples and scores a hell of a lot of runs considering the team he is on.  You say the 184 hits is a low.. maybe true but if the rest of the league is not hitting and he still is and is repeating it near the top using that against him is a weak argument.  Now if he only was on pace for 150 this season then i could see your point.  For the Pirates he would be the starting Lead off hitter at least for the rest of this season leaving Polanco out (baring another injury)  You maybe right in not trading Polanco for Revere as i wouldn't do it either but with Revere you use Polanco to get a better first basemen or another starter or send him to AAA.
buccos,3dl1g7,redrage97,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:48:40 2015 UTC,I also think you are seriously over valuing Polanco.  you are saying he is going to be like Cutch and maybe even Marte.  He is not.   You honestly should just stop commenting on baseball in general. Polanco was the top prospect in baseball last season. He hasn't even played a full season yet (barely two halves even considering he spent most of 2014 on the bench). The Pirates have been negotiating a Cutch/Marte level contract with him since the off-season.   You have no idea what Polanco's career is going to end up like. No one does. But he absolutely has that level of potential. If you asked any GM right now if they would take Polanco the vast majority of them would offer their top tier prospect for him in a heartbeat.
buccos,3dl1g7,tonytroz,0,Sat Jul 18 15:20:16 2015 UTC,"Polanco hasn't been on the bench that much and when he has it was mostly against lefties.. at least this season.. considering he hasn't been on the bench as much as you say he has over 650 PAs which would be about right for a starter who doesn't play against lefties these days for a full season.  The contract talk.. no one really cares about..  You cant use it to judge a value of a player. Cutch came in practically an all star and Marte not far behind.  If you know anything about baseball you'd know that cutch/marte level pay is EXTREMELY team friendly especially now when average players are making 4 million.  By the time  Marte will start seeing 10 million the average salary will probably be closer to 6 or 7 million.  You tell me a Cutch level salary and i tell you a better than average player but not perennial all star which I agree would be great for Polanco cause i think that's where he fits.  Don't forget Bobby Bo is still being paid by the Mets for his play ;-)   Top prospect.. top prospect.. Jose Tabata was the Yankees top prospect, Brandon Wood was number freaking 2 on the prospect list for the MLB.  while Yasmany Tomas barely made the top 100 (80s i think) Remember that when talking about Top prospects.  What you said is 100% true, I, you, the coaches, the management have no idea what Polanco will do will end up being.  I dont' think he'll be pulling of Marte or Cutch level performances and as i stated trading him for Revere outright probably would be a mistake.   As I said repeatedly, In the win-now attitude Ben Revere is worth more to the team on the field than Polanco this season and probably next even more now since we have no lead off hitter.  (but pricks don't bother reading they just find one or two lines and jump on it)  After that.. /shrug  If you want to talk more about this please do so in message format instead of comments.  I don't want you do embarrass yourself further."

buccos,3dhx1x,TrooWizard,10,Thu Jul 16 13:12:33 2015 UTC,"Start looking at maps, our road layout is one of the worst in the states. But other things that are Pittsburgh-y:   Duquesne Incline Primantis (Strip location- check out the Strip District too!) We have an awesome cultural district (that you're probably staying in) if you're into art/museums The casino is brand new, if you wanna check that out (21+ only) The Pittsburgh Zoo is pretty great, but dunno how different that would be from an Aussie standpoint? Point State Park/Schenley Park are nice to chill in (if you are active, grab a bike tour of the city- we just added a buncha bike lanes) Nationality Rooms at the University of Pittsburgh are pretty special (funded by the country and decorated accordingly- sign up for tours to get access) South Side is great for a bar crawl/food... I've heard its the most density bar area in the states? (Not sure if true)   I feel like I'm scraping lower on the barrel but those are some things that seem ""must-see"" like for Pittsburgh   Edit: format/one more add"

If it's before a 7:05 game get here at like 4:30 to get a table so you don't have to wait, if so you'll only wait like 20 minutes. Also for parking, park in the greyhound bus garage and walk to the strip and then to the stadium. I'm usually on the 3-11 every day except Friday, Monday, and Wednesday."

buccos,3dhx1x,KeepItApathetic,2,Thu Jul 16 18:32:28 2015 UTC,"Also if you're tired of traveling/driving you can rent a kayak and see the city that way. Rentals are on the North Shore by the 6th Street Bridge, so basically right across the river from the Renaissance. If you've ever watched a Pirates afternoon game and seen a ton of bright yellow kayaks in the water outside the stadium, a good number of those are probably Kayak Pittsburgh rentals. https://www.ventureoutdoors.org/kayak-pittsburgh/  Spend a Saturday morning in the Strip District as well. It's one of the uniquely Pittsburgh places in the city. Most of the food shops won't appeal to you since you're traveling but if you're looking to be surrounded by a sea of black and gold merchandise (much of it hilarious knock-offs), that's the place to go.  And this is probably a no brainer but since I haven't seen anyone else mention it, make sure you spend some time on the river walk before the game. It's a really nice walk. And generally before Friday & Saturday night games there's a block party on Federal street right outside PNC Park."

buccos,3dgtqw,devolved707,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:15:30 2015 UTC,"The correct answer is yes.  Seriously, though, the plain gold P is a classic that's been used off and on since the 1940s. But the yellow and white P has been gradually going from being the alternate to being the every day hat. Personally, I love both, but prefer the black/white/yellow version slightly more.   As for frequency of wear, from what I understand, the starting pitcher makes the call as to what uniform they wear most days. Burnett and Liriano always choose the black/yellow/white style, Cole usually picks the tradional black and gold, and the other two seem pretty random. So, really, it seems to be about 50/50 these days (excluding the camo hat for Thursday home games and 70s gold hat for Sunday home games)."

Not saying he can't make it there but  I think its gonna take a little bit longer for him to crack the big leagues; not at 21/22 in three years.
buccos,3dhjxf,2xtimes,2,Thu Jul 16 20:41:16 2015 UTC,Yeah it was a best case scenario list to say the least. I just thought this would be something cool to look back on over the next three years.
buccos,3deb1q,migosversace121,17,Wed Jul 15 16:30:38 2015 UTC,"Blame Bud Selig. After the tie at the 2002 ASG, he's the one who came up with the moronic ""this time, it matters"" nonsense that makes managers manage competitively.  ASG should basically be dirt-lot rules, everyone clowning around having fun and putting an actual human fun face on the game for fans (and kids), it should in no way matter this, or any, time."
buccos,3deb1q,npcdel,8,Wed Jul 15 16:38:02 2015 UTC,Yeah! It should be unwatchable just like every other all star type game!
buccos,3deb1q,shadowslayer978,8,Wed Jul 15 17:18:35 2015 UTC,"In the NBA its easy to not try. Players don't play defense and on offense they just dick around and jack up three's and alley oops. The Pro Bowl in the NFL is massively slowed down and defenders don't seem to give a shit if they get burnt for a 60 yard bomb. I don't watch hockey, but to my understanding, its very similar.  Here's the thing with the MLB All-Star Game, and I think this would hold true if it was just for fun: Once a player is in the batters box or in the field, its really hard to not try. Baseball is a sport, more than any other, built on muscle memory. If a guy sees a 96 mph pitch, his instincts are going to kick in. If a third baseman see's a shot smoked in his direction with a chance of going down the foul line for extra bases, he's going to dive for it.   So I really do think a competitive baseball all-star game can exists without some stupid, contrived narrative."
buccos,3deb1q,cytopathic_effect,4,Wed Jul 15 17:29:38 2015 UTC,It already was that way for a very long time...the All Star game used to be a pretty brutal showdown between AL and NL before interleague play if you believe baseball historians

buccos,3deb1q,npcdel,0,Fri Jul 17 01:09:42 2015 UTC,"I'm saying make it crazy-fun, like a magic-8-ball colored ball a batter can call for at an at-bat, that counts as 8 runs if he homers, but 8 outs if he makes an out. Or have all-time batters and use ghost runners (ghost running provided by Billy Hamilton) and have the pitchers use wiffle-balls. Go nuts, make it fun"
buccos,3deb1q,shadowslayer978,2,Wed Jul 15 17:28:47 2015 UTC,"How about as a compromise, you have the coaches of the bottom teams in the AL and NL coach the ASG teams? The A's and Phillies certainly aren't going to make it to the WS, so there's no point in them trying to be super competitive and screwing over older players like Burnett, but at the same time they would actually try to some degree, so the game isn't unwatchable or, as you described, a bunch of super star athletes looking like window-lickers playing Calvin-ball."

buccos,3deb1q,pghgamecock,5,Thu Jul 16 00:13:24 2015 UTC,"The NL had 14 active pitchers on their roster last night, and there were only 9 innings. It was going to be natural that some pitchers weren't going to get in. The Pirates got 3 players in the game, including 2 pitchers. Pirates fans really have no right to complain."
buccos,3deb1q,jwt155,3,Wed Jul 15 23:15:45 2015 UTC,"Yea, we weren't going to have 3 innings set aside for our pitchers. Melancon was a previous All Star but even he didn't pitch in his first All Star game. It would have been great to see him pitch but oh well."
buccos,3deb1q,mtk180,11,Wed Jul 15 23:28:42 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. It's bullshit that Kershaw gets in as the last guy, yet he gets to pitch and Burnett doesn't. Seriously, what the fuck.. Also, K-Rod pitching? First of all, the dude is garbage. Second, he's been to six all-star games. This was AJ's only chance at it. I live out here in the Bay Area and I'm gonna give Bochy hell the next time I go to a game. Dude is a shitty guy."

buccos,3deb1q,IamNotYourBuddy,10,Wed Jul 15 20:38:56 2015 UTC,Also screw him for picking Grandal over Cervelli as a reserve. Cervelli had way more votes.
buccos,3deb1q,TheDawawa,8,Wed Jul 15 17:01:39 2015 UTC,Cervelli did not deserve to be in over Grandal.  Just stop it.
buccos,3deb1q,Kodyak77,3,Wed Jul 15 21:35:10 2015 UTC,"First you said Grandal, then you changed it to Molina.  Pick one.  Grandal > Cervelli > Molina"
buccos,3deb1q,Joshduman,3,Wed Jul 15 21:59:09 2015 UTC,Molina getting in was a player vote.
buccos,3deb1q,TheDawawa,2,Wed Jul 15 22:53:04 2015 UTC,"What defensive categories is Cervelli better than Grandal at?  He is 2% higher at throwing base runners out.  That is it.  Cervelli has a higher but that is where it ends offensively.  He does not having a higher OBP.  He is DRASTICALLY lower in homeruns and slugging.    Grandal is having a very, very good season for a catcher thus far.  Cervevill is doing quite well for his expectations and situation on the Pirates, but their numbers are not even close."
buccos,3deb1q,pylon567,3,Wed Jul 15 23:05:06 2015 UTC,"Probably didn't go with Cervelli based off his numbers. Average was great, but if he had more HR/RBI, he'd be a shoe in."
buccos,3deb1q,IamNotYourBuddy,6,Wed Jul 15 23:27:42 2015 UTC,I assume he probably didn't go with Cervelli because Grandal is in his division and he see's him a lot. Seeing a good player a lot will make someone think they are better than someone they rarely see. Notice how a good portion of the reserves are from the NL West.
buccos,3deb1q,bucs_and_squats,2,Thu Jul 16 01:04:12 2015 UTC,"That, and Grandal was better?"
buccos,3deb1q,chuckberry314,-1,Wed Jul 15 17:30:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, this, as well. Double screw Bochy."
buccos,3deb1q,jeremy8826,-2,Wed Jul 15 19:21:18 2015 UTC,agreed.
buccos,3deb1q,Kodyak77,3,Thu Jul 16 01:04:05 2015 UTC,I can't complain to much. At least we got 3 of 4 pirates in the game. That's pretty good. And if I remember correctly neither Wacha nor Martinez got to pitch either...
buccos,3deb1q,mtk180,5,Wed Jul 15 17:31:08 2015 UTC,You guys don't even know what happened.  It's entirely possible Clint or AJ told Bochy not to pitch him.  That happens way more often than you think.
buccos,3deb1q,THEcasanova,2,Wed Jul 15 17:06:50 2015 UTC,"AJ did say he was a little disappointed he didn't get into the game, which leads me to believe that he was available. Unless the Pirates are playing this one close to the chest, which I'm not really sure why they would do that."

I saw a justification above for Cervelli and am thus switching my vote.    Best Play:   Cutch walkoff homer.    Best Pitcher:   Tough, but I'm going Cole with Burnett as 1B.

buccos,3dci7w,stargellstar,3,Wed Jul 15 11:07:26 2015 UTC,"The Dodgers are still the most popular MLB team in SK.  This is because there's a huge Korean population in LA as well as the fact that a few popular Korean players have played there over the years (Chan Ho Park, Hee Seop Choi, and now Hyun Jin Ryu).  However, if the Buccos finish strong and go deep in the playoffs and Kang has a hand in it, I'm sure there'll be a lot of Bucco fans in SK.  I'm actually hopung the Bucs make a bid to sign Kang's 1st baseman teammate from Nexon."

buccos,3dci7w,stargellstar,2,Wed Jul 15 15:18:08 2015 UTC,"I think if they went for this guy it would be more about depth than as a starter (like Kang earlier this year), so I don't think this would block Bell.  $11 mil over 4 yrs (Kang's contract) is not expensive for potential good bench depth and insurance at 1st.  Remember, Pedro could be traded this off season.  Might be more competition next year to bid for KBO players, though."
buccos,3dci7w,AaadamPgh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:54:51 2015 UTC,"I think Kang's versatility in the field played a role in his signing, along with the potential for Walker to be gone after next season, opening a spot for Kang as a starter. Park, on the other hand, is primarily a first baseman & Josh Bell is a switch hitter poised to play everyday at first for a good number of years. So, unless the Pirates decide to move Pedro before next year's trade deadline, I don't see them spending any real amount of money on a multi-year first baseman."

buccos,3dci7w,Pennsylvasia,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:26:06 2015 UTC,"Kang has done a lot to increase Pittsburgh's exposure in South Korea, especially since the team has been terrible the last two decades.  It'll never complete with L.A. and the huge Korean and Korean-American population, but it's nice to have Pittsburgh on the map there for baseball.  A decade ago, Pittsburgh was known for Hines Ward (half-Korean), and now the Pirates games are big news each day, especially when Kang does well.  He's even in the news when he's not playing; Sports Seoul did a profile on his apartment and what he does in his spare time:   http://pennsylvasia.blogspot.com/2015/06/sports-seoul-looks-at-jung-ho-kang-his.html  Kang is the second Korean to play in the regular season for Pittsburgh.  They had pitcher Chan-ho Park briefly in the 2010 season, and while in a Pirates uniform he set the record for most wins by an Asian-born pitcher.  Other Koreans in the system never made it out of spring training."

buccos,3d5oam,Treacy,9,Tue Jul 14 01:39:33 2015 UTC,"The article was written by DJ Gallo, the founder of the sports pickle. He's a huge Pirates fan too."
buccos,3d5oam,Pensfan66595,4,Tue Jul 14 03:26:00 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm not of the opinion to make huge moves now. I like what we have looking forward, and feel we don't have to seriously harm it to be very competitive. I mean, we lose Burnett this year. That will be a large blow. But even if we don't sign anyone in the offseason, we get Glasnow, Bell, Hanson (although he might be up this year), hopefully Kingham, and hopefully Taillon. The difference is that if we trade away a couple of these for a rental, I don't know if we can hope for sustained success. I'm fine with what we have now, and if we are ever going to push in, I'm still fine waiting at least a year.  If next year- Bell doesn't look like he can give us what Pedro gives us and the pitchers aren't as great as we hoped then we push in because the loss of Walker, Alvarez, Cervelli, Melancon, and Stewart might be too much to be able to overcome."
buccos,3d5oam,Joshduman,3,Tue Jul 14 04:04:06 2015 UTC,"Well like he said, even if we don't make a big move and rely on our prospects to give us long term success, thats not wrong either.

buccos,3d4p22,Rallyks,57,Mon Jul 13 14:32:10 2015 UTC,"Pittsburgher and Korean here! Been a Pittsburgh sports fan my whole life, so it's been surreal to see first Hines Ward and now Kang Jung-Ho play for my favorite teams. Some people are wondering, so for some background, Kang Jung-Ho is very popular in Korea right now, especially because he's the first ever position player to go straight from the KBO to the MLB without a stint in the minors. Though while having Hines did make quite a few people into Steelers fans, the Dodgers are probably the #1 MLB team there, with what Ryu Hyun Jin and the fact that there are a lot of LA/SK connections (though with Kang's recent performances, the Pirates are making waves!). Also, here's a rough translation of what the announcers were saying in the video for the bigger moments:     ""And Marte hits it to right! Where will Mercer end up... and he gets all the way to home! That's the first run, and now they're only down one. Up next is Kang Jung-Ho."" ""After the first pitch, the Cardinals are having a meeting on the mound."" ""Of his two hits against Rosenthal, he [Kang] hit a triple and a home run."" (As Kang hits the ball) ""That's it!!"" ""That's right! It goes to center and Marte makes it to second."" ""Now... if it's like that, that's Kang's third hit against Rosenthal. He's making a habit out of getting hits against Rosenthal, which is a pretty good habit to have."" ""Pitch outside AND IT'S..."" ""GO! GO! GO!"" ""And Marte HOME HOME HOME he's coming home! And Kang Jung Ho is SAFE AT THIRD! It's a tie game thanks to Cervelli!"" ""Wow..."" ""Do you understand what I'm saying about this team, now?"" ""You were right."" ""Now second year player Polanco to... WIIIIIIIIIIIIN AND END THE GAME!! AND KANG JUNG HO RUNS FOR THE WINNING SCORE! Today, Polanco made this victory happen!"" ""These two teams didn't make it easy. And Kang Jung Ho, today, after he scored the winning run, celebrated like this."" ""Look at how wide the eyes of the players go in the dugout!"" ""Now McCutchen wasn't able to get a hit, but he'll probably sleep very well tonight."" ""Someone like McCutchen, he's not going to care about something like that [his hitting streak ending]. He loves individual accomplishment and team accomplishments, but he's the kinda player who likes a team accomplishment even more."" ""Kang Jung Ho is in the middle of the celebrating players! The guy who was on the peripheries yesterday is right in the middle of the celebration tonight."" ""He's been kind of the one outsider on the team, so this is good to see."" ""And Kang Jung Ho is one of those guys who loves team celebrations more than his own on-field play! That they [Kang and his teammates] can't really understand each other doesn't mean anything right now."""

buccos,3d6u7x,superbob80,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:52:35 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but this is delusional. On no planet, does a very good starting catcher carry equal weight of a decent bullpen arm. It's not even close. I classify bullpen arms into three different categories: Legitimately good, dime-a-dozen good, and bad (there's obviously the Riveria's and Kimbrel's of the world, but those types are such an anomaly). Wilson falls into that second category. Is he a good bullpen arm? Yeah, it seems like it, especially if he can keep his control in check. Is he legitimately good in the same way Melancon or Tony Watson are? I don't think so. I think he's replaceable, as we've proved. And I'm not even going to get into the shelf life of a good reliever.  Cervelli on the other hand is an everyday catcher with premium defense, which alone, makes him infinitely more valuable than a dime-a-dozen relief pitcher. I'm not even talking about his offensive contribution this year, which are more gravy than they are an expectation.   And then there's the other variable: Cervelli is x10000 times better, and cheaper, than Brian McCann, who the Yankees essentially chose over Cervelli."
buccos,3d6u7x,migosversace121,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:10:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  They are spending $85MM on Brian Mccann for almost the same production that the Bucs are getting from Cervelli.  They have it to spend, but that does not make it worth it.  Spinning a deal that is hugely lopsided for one team as a ""good for both teams"" trade is such a Yankees fan move."

The Cardinals have been battered in back to back series and the Pirates have won 6 of their last 7. It's pretty black and white who the hotter team is."
buccos,3d52a9,jwt155,2,Tue Jul 14 04:43:18 2015 UTC,"Are they for who's hot and who's not?  If so, they're more useless than they already are.  Recency bias is for chumps."
buccos,3d52a9,bucs_and_squats,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:52:22 2015 UTC,"You don't think it's worth weighing the skill of a team based off recent games? If I'm gambling or picking winners and losers its most certainly useful information. I wouldn't necessarily weigh it more heavily than the current overall standings but if team A is 45-35 and is playing team B who is 40-40, it is definitely noteworthy to take into account that team A has lost 7 straight games while team B has won 8 straight before analyzing who you think will win/lose or is the current ""better"" team as of today. That's the entire rationale behind power rankings. It's like investing stock into a company, where do you want to put your money, the company with the higher prices but have flatlined or the company that's been gaining steam and value over the last month."
buccos,3d52a9,jwt155,2,Tue Jul 14 05:05:37 2015 UTC,"Recency bias is exactly that.  If a team loses 7 in a row and still has the best record in ball, then hell they must be pretty damn good.  Given the body of work, I'd still take the Cards over the Pirates.  Of course, sports is a game with infinite variables, so it's all moot."
buccos,3d52a9,bucs_and_squats,-2,Tue Jul 14 05:21:44 2015 UTC,"So if a team hypothetically wins 100 games and then loses 60 in a row, they should beat a team who's lost 100 but have won 60 in a row in a wildcard playoff game? Recent relevance is very important. If Team A has a much better record than team B but their team batting average has only been .230 in the past 10 games where as team Bs cumulative average the past 10 games has been a staggering .360 you would still side with the team with the overall better record? Baseball is a sport with so many variables and power rankings allows numerous other variables to enter the equation apart from wins and losses. The Pirates could have the best record in baseball by 15 games, but if Cutch and Cole were tragically injured tomorrow and out for the season, wouldn't you find an alternative ranking system more appropriate then simply wins and losses?"
buccos,3d52a9,jwt155,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:29:25 2015 UTC,"The Pirates could have the best record in baseball by 15 games, but if Cutch and Cole were tragically injured tomorrow and out for the season, wouldn't you find an alternative ranking system more appropriate then simply wins and losses?     We're talking about the first and second place team in the rankings with no drastic changes to the roster injury wise, both performing equally to their Pythagorean records (if you're into that sort of thing).  Since that's the case, any comparison of recent wins and losses seems a bit rash to me.  And again, I'm not saying you're dumb thinking the Pirates are better.  I'm saying it's not idiotic to think the Cardinals are still better.  The last two wins neither helps not hurts either case, unless you're a fan of all that narrative stuff about ""teams never quitting"".  That's good for documentaries, I suppose."
buccos,3d52a9,bucs_and_squats,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:42:55 2015 UTC,"That's a vastly more extreme case and you know it. Since record is the result of underlying truths about the team, you'd imagine that a team that's lost 60 in a row had its entire pitching staff killed or something--because such an extremal result wouldn't otherwise be possible.  But what we're actually dealing with isn't that--it's how to weight, for example, the whole season's record combined with the last two weeks' record to come up with a single measure of team quality. The latter is typically employed to identify what direction the team is headed, but that's often the opposite of appropriate--the team is more likely to regress to their full season record.  Power rankings are just narrative tools."
buccos,3d52a9,everyday847,0,Tue Jul 14 15:22:17 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I made the cases more extreme to show there is value in creating a rank system based on more information than just wins vs losses. Look at the NBA playoffs this past season and how Cleveland went from one of the best teams in the league and favored to win it all to being an underdog when Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love went down...  I just think it's pretty clear that when a team has lost 9 out of their past 14 games they shouldn't be ranked higher (let alone #1) than a team who has won 8 of their past 9. Having the Pirates beat the Cardinals in the last 3 games is just icing on the cake for my argument."
buccos,3d52a9,jwt155,3,Tue Jul 14 15:45:42 2015 UTC,"You're really investing a lot in small sample sizes. Suppose that PIT and STL are exactly as strong as their present win % up prior to the four game series (i.e. .647 vs. .595). The likelihood of each outcome, from STL 4 - PIT 0 to STL 0 - PIT 4, is: 0.074, 0.271, 0.374, 0.229, 0.053. So the present outcome had nearly a 25% chance of occurring assuming that seasonal win percentages hold true. If instead you use your arbitrary cutoff of 5/14, 8/9 (and you should be suspicious of your reasoning every time you decide to include more games for one team than another), the probabilities would be 0.006, 0.067, .282, .528, .149.  So the present result is only twice as likely to occur in a world where the Pirates' real quality on those four nights was that of an .888 team and the Cards' that of a .357 team. Which, sure--because we won that series, it's more likely. But if we had lost that series 1-3, you would be looking to justify how a STL team that was 0.500 over its past 14 games had beaten 3-1 a PIT team that had gone 6/9, and you would have the opposite problem!  Your statistics just aren't robust. Here's the relevant exercise. Imagine you're a gambler who bets on the team with the better ""last 10 games"" record every time, when the odds are based on the ratio of the two teams' season records. (So a .667 team playing a .333 team gets 2-to-1.) Do you think you'll make money?  A good metric will combine both factors, but--barring major injuries to key players that happened just before the ""last n games""--the seasonal record matters far more."

buccos,3d52a9,woodchuck10,7,Mon Jul 13 17:52:17 2015 UTC,"I think that's kind of the point, though. For how flippant these rankings can be, it's clear that Bucs bested the Cards and deserve the number one spot for the current power rankings. I don't think any of us are losing sleep over this, but it seems like a fairly straightforward sell that the Bucs are currently the hottest team in the game with that sort of series finale going into the ASG break. Frankly, those last two games were arguably in the top 10 games I've seen any team play, period."
buccos,3d52a9,art36,3,Mon Jul 13 18:45:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah in addition to the other places people put on here, Jonah Keri ranked us #1 on his All-Star Break edition of The 30."

buccos,3d52a9,FleetSevens,3,Mon Jul 13 17:11:45 2015 UTC,"They still have the best record in baseball and very easily could have won this series. It's kind of hard to knock a team for losing 2 extra inning games on the road without their #1 pitcher starting. Cards still have the best vegas odds to win the NL as well.  Obviously this was a huge series for the Buccos, but they still have ground to make up. A #1 power ranking doesn't mean much if they can't close those 2.5 games after the break. I'd rather the Pirates get snubbed in the media, it just makes them hungrier. Look at what happened early in the season when all the experts were picking them to win the division."

And they would always make comments about how bad the Pirates were and how it was stupid for me to want to watch them lose every night. This was during the Tike Redman (my favorite player at the time) days so they were usually right about the losing part.  But now in 2015 it's funny to see those same friends posting on Facebook about how awesome the Pirates are.  Long story short... I raise my glass and give a big ole cheers to the fans that have stuck through it, put in their time, and are now finally being rewarded."

So, now I think I'll have some time and it looks like it's the best time to be a Pirates fan hahaha.   I've kept following the scores and all, but how is going? What the major things that happened?

We won a four game series 3-1 against the Cards, with the last two as walkoffs in extra innings to pull within 2.5 games of first. Plus some controversy in Saturday's game with some horrible calls, bad umpiring, and general tomfoolery, but somehow the Pirates pulled it off to win in the 14th.   Otherwise, pretty much just some really solid baseball over the last few months and we're looking like just about the best team in baseball, so that's nice.   And welcome back!

But I bravely began the third sandwich. At this point what has been a delicious, even glorious, pastrami, egg, and cheese sandwich turned into a disgusting, revolting slop.

buccos,3d4t2y,PocketWater,6,Mon Jul 13 15:04:42 2015 UTC,Other than bench upgrades I think we are good. Team chemistry is under rated and more valuable than slightly better numbers
buccos,3d4t2y,AMcMahon1,5,Mon Jul 13 15:09:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd only have Hague and Byrd as platoon players to face LHP, and to pinch hit."
buccos,3d4t2y,Aaron15063,4,Mon Jul 13 15:17:13 2015 UTC,I would love to have Byrd back.
buccos,3d4t2y,AaadamPgh,2,Mon Jul 13 18:35:37 2015 UTC,"Bench guy, bullpen guy, maybe include Locke in a trade to try to upgrade the rotation (but no Cole Hamels-level guys). None of those would be major moves, trading away good really players/prospects though."
buccos,3d4t2y,NapoleonBlownapart87,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:11:44 2015 UTC,"I'd rather not include Locke in a trade to upgrade the rotation if we can help it. The pitching depth has been suspect given all of the injuries, so I would love to have Locke and Worley available to start since there isn't much in Indy right now."
buccos,3d4t2y,jedwar05,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:14:04 2015 UTC,"Matt Hague is an interesting name to bring up. Although I'm not against it, he's done it against AAA pitching. He doesn't have a history of doing it against MLB pitching. I work in the International League so have seen plenty of him, and the numbers don't lie. He's a great bat that could probably play off the bench. He's the Hit Collector for a reason. But what's to say he wouldn't need an adjustment period and be any better than Hart/Ishikawa/Lombardozzi etc?  Who would I go out and get? One guy that I think fits well would be Chris Johnson. Gives a little bit of positional flexibility and mashes lefties, exactly what we need.   I also think another bullpen arm is needed. I'm not sure what the price tag would be, and god knows Billy Beane wouldn't do it unless he gets what he wants, but Tyler Clippard would be near the top of my list. They're ready for Doolittle to close when he gets back and Clippard can walk at the end of the year. Couple mid level prospects for Clippard? Sign me up."
buccos,3d4t2y,jedwar05,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:30:44 2015 UTC,"Small sample size here, but Hague did hit .304 in 24 plate appearances vs. LHP in 2012, his largest exposure to major league pitching.   Here are his minor league numbers vs. LHP by year:  2014 - .500 in 24 AB's  2013 - .320 in 125 AB's  2012 - .319 in 113 AB's  2011 - .308 in 168 AB's  Tough part is he doesn't have much pop at all, but if he can be an on base machine in spot starts vs. LHP and the occasional pinch hit shot against a LH reliever, might be worth giving up not very much at all to get him since he is in AAA."
buccos,3d4t2y,cutchye,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:16:37 2015 UTC,"Way too small a sample size to merit any value vs MLB pitchers, but obviously a trend is there. He hits lefties. As a guy coming off the bench as a pinch hitter or spot starter the pop isn't necessary at all. The on base skills are much more important, as you allude to. Giving up ""not very much"" probably won't net him though. The Jays just happen to have the best offense in the league, and they want him receiving every day AB's. That has to be done at AAA. I don't think they'll just give up on him because another team comes calling."
buccos,3d4t2y,promoreader2,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:39:12 2015 UTC,"Hague struggled with the Pirates, and we really don't need him. I would love to see the Byrd man come back, however Polanco really stepped up this series and proved himself..hopefully a sign of good things to come. It would be nice to have another starter in the rotation and a platoon 1B with Pedro."
buccos,3d4t2y,webbbbb,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:33:40 2015 UTC,"Pirates used to have Matt Hague...Absolute trash.... screw finding a replacement for Hart; he's complete garbage as well. Either a bonafide Major League-level 2-3 spot in the rotation pitcher (Cole Hamels) or an effective, left handed bench bat (Ben Revere) is what they need, and I think this is the year Nutting goes balls to the wall. THE TIME IS NOW"
buccos,3d4t2y,redrage97,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:37:36 2015 UTC,"Guy only got 70 AB's with us, and only 14 games started, so I wouldn't say the guy is trash. It's not an easy thing to get a start here or there and most your AB's come from pinch hitting."
buccos,3d4hnh,pittguy578,9,Mon Jul 13 13:26:56 2015 UTC,"Pirates have the smallest TV deal of all the teams, roughly $30M $18M per year from local, $50M from national, and takes in roughly $55M a year in attendance (tickets plus concessions and souvenirs), plus revenue sharing. So yes, maintaining a high attendance matters significantly to the player budget, but those tend to lag a year (ie: they pay now based on last years attendance, which was also quite good).   For comparison, the Dodgers local TV deal gets them about $350M a year, so attendance matters less to them in terms of overall planning  Edit: The Pirates local TV deal is actually $18M a year."
buccos,3d4hnh,lost_thought_00,5,Mon Jul 13 14:49:47 2015 UTC,"The Pirates really let Root screw them with that deal.  As far as I can tell, they had one of the highest ratings last seasons in all of MLB.  Granted it is a smaller market, so that translates to less people than larger markets with lower ratings, but they are far from the lowest in eyeballs on the screen in the league.  When does the deal expire?"
buccos,3d4hnh,jimbo831,6,Mon Jul 13 17:25:27 2015 UTC,Deal expires in 2019. It was signed at the end of 2012 - aka the worst possible time from the Pirate's perspective.
buccos,3d4hnh,lost_thought_00,5,Mon Jul 13 17:57:46 2015 UTC,Exactly. You can't compare last season's ratings to 20 years of losing when they signed the deal.
buccos,3d4hnh,tonytroz,2,Mon Jul 13 19:19:16 2015 UTC,"Plus, that was right when DVR started really taking off, which turned sports in to the only ""appointment television"" on the air.  I really think that's what lead to the crazy numbers that we're seeing now.  I mean, who watches commercials on their favorite shows anymore?"
buccos,3d4hnh,yeti77,3,Tue Jul 14 04:39:53 2015 UTC,I'm kind of a baseball noob so it's pretty crazy to see how much money teams make from TV and radio. I always wondered how teams made so much money when a lot of team don't have their seats filled every game

When the Pirates win a bunch of years and we suck bad then maybe I'll hate you guys, but now you are a great city with a fun team. Easy to like. Hell, I even like the Cubs sorta...maybe all these good years have me drunk on winning. But not the Reds. And I do hate the Giants. Down with the awful Giants. :)"

buccos,3czf3b,PhantomJB93,6,Sun Jul 12 05:05:08 2015 UTC,Was listening to the game on my MLB app as I was driving down the 5 freeway in San Diego. Needless to say I screamed after that call of the walk off! Let's go bucs!!!!
buccos,3czf3b,callie06,6,Sun Jul 12 05:21:26 2015 UTC,In the last several years there are a few games that stand out. Obviously 2013 wildcard game. The MICHAEL MCKENRY THE FORT HR game. And now this one.   RAISE THE JOLLY ROGER!!!!!
buccos,3czf3b,PocketWater,6,Sun Jul 12 05:22:51 2015 UTC,The game last year right about this time where Cutch hit a homer to tie it in the 9th and then again to win it in the 12th also rings a bell.

buccos,3czf3b,OBJoyful,6,Sun Jul 12 05:37:57 2015 UTC,You guys want to bet that the Cards manager took issue with Cutch running around first with his finger up so he gets beaned tomorrow?

I listen to every game and I'm content that way. When I grew up in the 70's, they only put like 35 games on tv a year, and never a home game.  Radio was the normal way to follow them.   Now with the internet, we can see all the highlights anyway on mlb.com, afterwards, so that helps."

buccos,3d0jcc,rjromes13,3,Sun Jul 12 14:12:21 2015 UTC,"Francouer is mediocre, seems strange that they're even considering him. I feel like they're going to want a lot for Revere though. 27, speedy, career .292 hitter. Is it worth giving up someone like Meadows for him? I can't imagine they'd dump him for less than someone like that. Would be solid insurance in case Polanco continues to struggle, but would suck to take at bats away from him."
buccos,3d0jcc,tonytroz,4,Sun Jul 12 16:27:23 2015 UTC,"Tim Williams stated that based on relative trade values that Revere would be worth a top 51-100 hitting prospect or a top 26-50 pitching prospect.  But that is if the Phillies get a single player in return for Revere.  Williams went further to say that a far more likely scenario would be that a team would send a B prospect and a couple of C prospects.    The Pirates aren't going to part with Meadows, at least not for a league-average player like Revere.  If anything they'd part with a non-top-100 hitting prospect and some third tier prospects."

buccos,3d0jcc,TweetPoster,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:12:45 2015 UTC,I'd definitely be interested in Revere.  Wonder if something including Harold Ramirez or Cole Tucker would be enough to get that done.

buccos,3d0jcc,jmb_412,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:56:45 2015 UTC,We just drafted Newman. You don't think they'd part with Tucker for Revere?
buccos,3d0jcc,Kodyak77,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:31:54 2015 UTC,RAJ is going to want more than that. He asked the Mariners for Taijuan Walker for Revere.
buccos,3d0jcc,jmb_412,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:45:54 2015 UTC,"Right.  And part of a negotiation is asking for more than you want and having the other person do the same and eventually meeting in the middle, or not.  He can ask whatever he wants but everyone knew Walker wasn't getting traded for Revere.  Unless there are a lot of teams who really need OF help at the trade deadline, acquiring Revere isn't going to require any name-brand prospects."

I think this is more on the manager than anything. Clint constantly preaches the 'next game' mentality, and you hear it in interviews with players. They constantly talk about moving on and only thinking about tomorrow. With the Cardinals, you get guys who tend to be a bit more whiney, like Matheny. Even Cardinals fans think he's too whiny and argues with umps too much. Molina is super whiny and annoying, and he has a leadership role in the clubhouse, and I'm sure he rubs off on other players."

buccos,3cvift,ericfg,6,Sat Jul 11 03:05:46 2015 UTC,"He's one year removed from an all-star season as a reliever, why the heck would you mess with that? The only pitcher on the roster with a better ERA is Melancon and they've pitched almost the exact same amount of innings.  We have one of the best rotations in baseball and guys in the bullpen like Caminero and Bastardo with ERA's pushing 4. Taking Watson out of the pen means those guys suck up more innings and blow twice as many games.  Great bullpens are a huge part of playoff baseball. Don't underestimate setup men."
buccos,3cvift,tonytroz,5,Sat Jul 11 05:11:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge fan of turning relievers into starters at the big league level. With that said if we had to turn a reliever of ours into a starter (minus Worley for obvious reasons), Watson would probably be our guy.   I think we actually need a pen arm at the deadline, so I don't want Watson moving to the rotation tbh. Melancon, Watson are the only two guys I really trust in 1 run games vs a team like STL, WAS, or LAD, etc. Caminero has a shot to be in the group with those two, but is a bit raw still"
buccos,3cvift,DTX180,3,Sat Jul 11 03:20:52 2015 UTC,Maybe.. I don't think it's a move that I'd worth making in the middle of a season like this though. Maybe if we are strapped for starters in am off season a few years down the road.
buccos,3cvift,THEcasanova,3,Sat Jul 11 04:00:00 2015 UTC,"Neil Huntington said last year, or maybe it was 2013, that in an dire situation, Watson would be who they would make a starter. And they were seriously considering it for a period of time when they had injuries in the starting lineup.   But I don't think they need him as a starter. Why lose a good reliever when you don't have to? Pirates essentially have 2 closers with him and Melancon. The Pirates top 3 pitchers in their rotation are very good. They have a solid number 4 and an average number 5 guy. They aren't in dire need of Watson to be a starter.   What they need is a better middle reliever than Caminero or Bastardo."

buccos,3cs5dx,rolobrowntowntony,3,Fri Jul 10 12:49:20 2015 UTC,"I read Kuklinski's book a while back, since we also have an affection for mob-related stuff.   Not sure about him. I'm almost inclined to give his story a similar amount of disbelief (regarding the numbers, at least) that we commonly do that of Henry Lee Lucas.  Speaking of mob-related murders, have you read I Heard You Paint Houses?  There's a whole lot that's impossible to confirm in that one, too; but it's still a pretty good story."
buccos,3cs5dx,ksek,3,Fri Jul 10 13:07:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, Kuklinski was all about hyperbole. I find him fascinating for the complete lack of emotion he shows when he talks about the victims, but you can tell he loves his family so much.  I'll have to check that book out, though. I'm not much of a reader but I can't put any CJ non-fiction books down. I've read way too many that it's somewhat disturbing haha."

A lot has been cleared out or traded to the used book store, but there's still plenty there that would no doubt show up in a poorly-written and edited article accompanied by the arsenal found at the scene should anything happen.   Interestingly, this book I'm reading now isn't the breathless fear-mongering I expected. It's totally about serial killers and their prevalence and methodology and such; but it's also a story about manufactured statistics regarding serial homicides and abductions and all that by congress and the FBI as a way to gain funding."
buccos,3cs5dx,Elopeppy,3,Fri Jul 10 13:31:39 2015 UTC,"That sounds interesting too! Damn, I went to the FBI headquarters back in April and they had a memorial for the OKC Bombing victims.

It was such an honor to be there and see that, and my mom's friend (who works for the FBI as a victims grief counselor) said that there's a way better area that she can take me to next time I visit.   I get so psyched by anything related to this stuff, I really should've done more than minor in CJ."
buccos,3cs5dx,bucsfan67,3,Fri Jul 10 13:42:36 2015 UTC,"I really feel like a CJ degree, in and of itself, is pretty useless (this is borne out by the fact that my wife hasn't done anything even remotely related to that industry since she earned the degree — though she did get to meet and speak with John Douglas at length once, which is pretty fucking sweet).

buccos,3cs5dx,MoreThanWards,6,Sat Jul 11 01:58:01 2015 UTC,"That ""Run PMC: Polanco, Marte, Cutch"" shirt makes no sense.  First of all, there are so many letter's that rhyme with ""D"", so Polanco 's inclusion is tenuous (yes I know they are all OFs but I'm talking about pun quality here). Second, Cutch isn't even his full name, so it's another change that disingenuously props up a faulty pun.  Then third, there is absolutely no connection between between Run D.M.C. and baseball, or the pirates, or anything.  Bad pun, bad shirt, 2/10 would not buy"

Only 1 was earned tonight but he still 100% deserved at least 2 of those and all were preventable.  The Pirates lost this game simply because you don't beat a top team with multiple major mistakes. Cutch grounding into a double play on the first pitch against a shaky pitcher, Pedro swinging on a 3-0 pitch with 2 on no outs, and Jordy botching an easy potential double play. Capitalize on two of those three and you have a good chance to win.   This first game was heavily in favor of the Cards with the way Martinez has been pitching. We have better pitching matchups the rest of the way, but if they continue to make major mistakes they can easily lose this series. Drop the game tomorrow with Cole and this could get ugly."

buccos,3cr45m,jeb_the_hick,2,Fri Jul 10 03:11:01 2015 UTC,You all should hot glue some giant googly eyes on the top of that thing.
buccos,3cr45m,hail_satan666,3,Fri Jul 10 04:54:02 2015 UTC,That would be so awesome.
buccos,3cr45m,tonytroz,5,Fri Jul 10 09:51:46 2015 UTC,This was just disappointing
buccos,3cr45m,vecnyj,4,Fri Jul 10 02:39:09 2015 UTC,I went to chess and missed Peripheral & Gangam style. Go figure. Let's take 3/4 now.
buccos,3cr45m,hail_satan666,4,Fri Jul 10 03:21:15 2015 UTC,That's why there's four games this series. We'll get them tomorrow! And the next day. And the next day. And the next day. And the next day. And the next day. And the next day. And the next day. And the next day. And the next day. And the next day.
buccos,3cr45m,vecnyj,5,Fri Jul 10 03:13:02 2015 UTC,Embarrassing
buccos,3cr45m,hail_satan666,12,Fri Jul 10 02:39:24 2015 UTC,"nah, carmart is just unreal this year."
buccos,3cr45m,rosstimus,5,Fri Jul 10 02:54:56 2015 UTC,He had a LOT of help today. Polanco cost the Pirates a run in the first. Mercer cost them 3. Dumb luck cost the Bucs a rally in the 4th. These shenanigans only seem to happen against the Cardinals.
buccos,3cr45m,hail_satan666,6,Fri Jul 10 03:12:33 2015 UTC,Pure pure luck. If not for that lucky double play they had we woulda won...
buccos,3cr45m,vecnyj,3,Fri Jul 10 02:41:59 2015 UTC,Normal Jeff Locke outing combined with bs Cardinals luck.
buccos,3cr45m,hail_satan666,11,Fri Jul 10 02:38:02 2015 UTC,Honest question. How were we lucky? What makes us luckier than everybody else? Baseball in general is a game with luck.
buccos,3cr45m,tonytroz,7,Fri Jul 10 02:47:06 2015 UTC,Two weird double plays with men on third and <2 outs.   Also the Jordy Mercer bobble that could have been a double play led to the 4 run inning.
buccos,3cr45m,nittanylion,10,Fri Jul 10 02:49:08 2015 UTC,How are your own base runners making mistakes our luck?   As for the Mercer play I can't disagree.
buccos,3cr45m,hail_satan666,9,Fri Jul 10 02:50:16 2015 UTC,Lucky in that this shit never happens as often as when we play you.
buccos,3cr45m,hail_satan666,5,Fri Jul 10 02:55:00 2015 UTC,Well I have no defense for that because the only Buccos games I get are when we play y'all.   Carry on my friend.
buccos,3cr45m,hail_satan666,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:56:52 2015 UTC,Because the Pirates have been beating up on mediocre teams all year outside of the division. The Cards are the top team in the league. Mistakes are amplified against good teams. Look at the last Nats series.
buccos,3cr45m,Drew119,3,Fri Jul 10 05:37:11 2015 UTC,"Kang didn't really make a mistake, it was just a weird play. You got lucky in that Polanco made a dumb mistake at an important moment."
buccos,3cr45m,nittanylion,3,Fri Jul 10 03:18:28 2015 UTC,Hasn't polanco been somewhat bad at that this year? I'm honestly asking because I've only seen a handful of your games.
buccos,3cr45m,hail_satan666,2,Fri Jul 10 03:20:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, especially recently he's made some very dumb outs on the basepaths. So it's not totally unexpected but still unlucky."
buccos,3cr45m,nittanylion,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:24:46 2015 UTC,How many years has he been up? Could have sworn he was a rookie last year. Unless I'm confused with Harrison.

We will take 2 of the next three, at least, and make this series a non-factor in the grand scheme of things.  We'll go to the All Star break 4.5 back and I'm okay with that (after being down as much as 9 or 10 or whatever the hell it was).  We can beat these guys.  Cubs proved they can be beaten.

buccos,3co5tz,jmb_412,2,Fri Jul 10 02:26:21 2015 UTC,I noticed that and upvoted everything in the past 5 minutes. Sorry people are dicks.
buccos,3co5tz,HappyMan420,2,Fri Jul 10 02:31:00 2015 UTC,"Man I feel bad for y'all. Between the downvoting, and the trolls who come in here and argue.. Not even the Yankees or Bosox fans do that to us when we are playing each other. And we don't do it to them.  It's disrespectful and immature. Cards fans are SO insufferable."
buccos,3co5tz,nittanylion,2,Fri Jul 10 02:28:58 2015 UTC,"In fairness, it ain't only Cards fans. I'm getting to the point that I don't even like baseball anymore just from dealing with the fucking fans."
buccos,3co5tz,HappyMan420,2,Fri Jul 10 02:31:55 2015 UTC,I'm assuming you aren't a football fan? I can't fucking stand football fans.  The fans are part of the reason baseball is my favorite sport. They don't seem nearly as bad to me as football/basketball fans.
buccos,3co5tz,nittanylion,3,Fri Jul 10 02:36:16 2015 UTC,"I grew up more of a college football fan than a baseball fan, actually (grew up — and still live — in the South, so its to be expected).   Football is worse, though; you're right. The world ends every week to much lamenting and gnashing of teeth. Shit's exhausting.   I think part of how tired I am of this is because of dealing with people on reddit. Hard to pistolwhip somebody on the Internet."
buccos,3co5tz,nittanylion,0,Fri Jul 10 02:39:38 2015 UTC,It's not just Cards fans...at least I don't think. We have one unknown dedicated down voter who has been here since last year. It's pretty impressive

They mentioned the 2011 WS win, but I'm surprised that they left out the part that would annoy opposing fans the most. On August 25, the Braves were leading the race for the wild card spot at 79-53, while the Cardinals were 10.5 games back at 69-64 (20 was the magic number). Over the remainder of the season, the Braves proceeded to go 10-20, while the Cardinals went 21-8 and grabbed the spot on that epic final day of the regular season. The Cardinals then just kept on rolling until they won the title. Down 2 runs and down to their last strike twice in Game 6 of the WS, but it didn't matter."

buccos,3cou8i,burts_beads,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:08:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think they ever seriously were but it was discussed.

All players involved obviously trended in opposite directions since then to make it seem more lopsided."
buccos,3cou8i,PhantomJB93,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:10:32 2015 UTC,Since when is Taillon a top of of the rotation starter? I thought he was always billed as a back end guy.
buccos,3cou8i,drunkenviking,3,Thu Jul 9 16:38:27 2015 UTC,"No, he was definitely supposed to become a #1 or #2, middle of the rotation at worst.  Everyone was convinced he was ""the future"" at pitcher until we drafted Cole a year later, and even then they were viewed as a 1-2 punch sort of thing.  His minor league production never really blew anyone away and then he had Tommy John, but up until then he was always viewed as guy who would eventually be top of the rotation.  Now of course it seems like it would be a minor miracle if he ever even makes it here as a #5."
buccos,3cou8i,PhantomJB93,3,Thu Jul 9 19:27:17 2015 UTC,You don't draft a fourth or fifth starter #2 overall.
buccos,3cou8i,tonytroz,2,Thu Jul 9 19:40:38 2015 UTC,Yeah but I thought he was projecting recently as a #4 or #5 guy.  Decreased expectations based on performance and all that.
buccos,3cou8i,drunkenviking,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:48:33 2015 UTC,"Correct, at this point only Glasnow projects as a top of the rotation starter.

Instead of becoming sellers and trading away good players, they could rent them out at the end of the season and help bring in more money. There would have to be rules. Players could only be rented during the season. So if a team wanted said player for the playoffs, they'd actually have to make a trade.   It's probably a bad idea, but I love bad ideas.

Or i guess we just sweep everyone and not have nailbiters"
buccos,3cmigv,DTX180,8,Thu Jul 9 02:40:55 2015 UTC,I don't know. And maybe its better not to know. I think they didn't like that the reasoning behind the Z came out and I semi think that is why they changes it. Maybe they want to keep it just so then the team knows the real meaning. If they keep playing like this then I don't want in on the joke I'll just blissfully and ignorantly keep doing the weird little shoulder point

buccos,3cjqob,bjsmithwv,6,Wed Jul 8 20:14:43 2015 UTC,"Andrew Fillipponi was on the radio this morning all upset that pirates fans gave such a nice ovation to Barmes and shit all over Grilli when he was back.  Correct me if I am wrong, but didn't Grilli leave and bad - talk the organization? Also, he left after sucking horribly in a season where we lost the division by 2 games. Barmes came here and did exactly what we got him to do: play solid defense and hand out ice cream to the players after the game. He never complained when he started losing his job to Mercer. He just went out there whenever he was called on and was happy to be part of the team.   Edit: and as a caller aptly pointed out, the only time we will see Grilli with his new team is when we are losing or the game is tied. By default we have to either root against him or root to lose a game. Barmes came up to bat and there was a lot of game left, so rooting for him at that point does not feel like betrayal."
buccos,3cjqob,Cardozos,3,Wed Jul 8 16:14:22 2015 UTC,"Fans are mostly shitting over Grilli because he's an egomaniac, not because they don't appreciate the work he did here."
buccos,3cjqob,IamNotYourBuddy,7,Wed Jul 8 22:23:36 2015 UTC,"Yea, but Andrew Fillipponi is an idiot, who says shit to get people talking about him.  It's worked for him so far in this city.  Everything you said is correct though.  Barmes was the constant pro, while Grilli left like a tortured toddler."
buccos,3cjqob,Buccos,6,Wed Jul 8 16:24:06 2015 UTC,Grilli didn't bad talk us I don't believe. If I'm not mistaken he has nothing but love for Pittsburgh. He  sees it as a home.

buccos,3ckvbn,tonytroz,2,Wed Jul 8 18:24:26 2015 UTC,I fully back Jose and honestly believe he did nothing wrong   Of course he did nothing wrong. His job is to get on base. The umpire awarded him first base according to the rules. You can talk about baseball etiquette all you want but at the end of the day if you want to get someone out throw a strike. They can't lean into a strike.  Tabata isn't paid $4M to let guys pitch perfect games.

Offensively he wasnt good at all, but only about 3 or 4 clubs have actual good offensive production from their SS. Barmes defensively was great and was an average level player based on WAR each 3 years for us. Can't complain about that.  Plus if you believe in the ""Inge effect"", hes one of those guys."

It's free and you can walk the Riverwalk to the stadium past Heinz.  I usually load up at the buffet then head to the ballgame.  Pro-tip: It's creepy on the riverwalk late at night, so walk back to the Casino on the road, or have ninja skills.  I don't have ninja skills and my wife is a scaredy cat, so we walk back on the road."

buccos,3ci34n,IamChantus,3,Thu Jul 9 06:30:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not much of an expert, but I go to a few games a year.  Tickets  If you don't want to mess with buying tickets on the secondary market, the Pirates have discounts for various things (Giant Eagle card, Dick's Score Card, etc.) at http://pittsburgh.pirates.mlb.com/pit/ticketing/value.jsp   Parking  Also, you can park cheaper near one of the Downtown ""T"" stations and ride the train for free over to/back from the North Side station, or park in that same area and walk across the Roberto Clemente Bridge to/from the game.  http://www.portauthority.org/paac/SchedulesMaps/StadiumService.aspx"
buccos,3ci34n,rhino43grr,4,Wed Jul 8 03:28:45 2015 UTC,"Tickets/Seating  Third baseline > First baseline. You get a great view of the city behind the action on the field. I almost always buy weekday tickets on StubHub for below face value. Weekend games are starting to get more expensive, so it's sometimes better to buy those in advance directly from the Pirates. There aren't cup holders for the seats in the 300 level. It's not a big deal, but it's something I hear other people commenting on when they sit up there for the first time.  Parking  I always park Downtown and walk/take the T to PNC. The garage on Ft. Duquesne & 6th is right across the Clemente Bridge, and it's only $7 on nights and weekends. The T is free to ride from downtown to the north side, so you can park anywhere downtown and take it right to PNC Park.  Before/After The Game  Check out the casino if you're into that. It's a good parking option and they have a killer happy hour if you're going to a weekday game. After the game beers are only $2.50 in the Rivertowne Brewing Hall of Fame Club (above the left field bleachers).  Eating Outside The Park  I like to eat Downtown before games. Market Square has a wide variety of restaurants in every price range. It's a short walk to PNC or you can ride the T from the nearby Gateway Station.  For Sunday afternoon games, I'll usually go to the Strip District in the morning. Great street food, some good breakfast/brunch spots, and a ton of shops and street vendors selling all kinds of Pittsburgh merchandise. My usual spots there are the taco stand in front of Reyna or sushi or a fish sandwich from Wholey's Fish Market.  At The Park  Check out the statues of Honus Wagner, Roberto Clemente, Willie Stargell, and Bill Mazeroski outside the gates. If the lines aren't too long, sign up for a free rally pass and spin the prize wheel. They're located behind the bleachers in left field and on the river walk behind the right field seats (also on the club level if you're sitting there). Most of the prizes are small (magnets, stickers, etc.), but you can win free tickets.  My biggest gripe with PNC Park are the narrow concourses. They weren't designed to handle the capacity crowds the Pirates have been drawing for weekend games. Give yourself plenty of time to make your way through the main concourse because it can be a slow process, especially on a Friday or Saturday night.   Eating Inside The Park  I'm cheap, so I don't usually eat inside the stadium. That being said, my favorite thing at PNC Park is the Pulled Pork Pierogi Stacker. There are Primanti Bros. sandwiches, but there's only three choices, so you're better off going to one outside the stadium (or not at all because I think they're highly overrated). You can find Quaker Steak wings (a popular regional wing restaurant) at various stands around the PNC.   You can bring in food and unopened water if you don't want to pay ballpark prices. I've seen people bring in footlong subs.  Beer  Beers of the Burgh on the first base side has the best selection. Again, stick around after the game for cheap beer in the Rivertowne Brewing Hall of Fame Club above the bleachers in left field. Iron City and IC Light are the cheap local beers of choice (think Old Style in Chicago or Natty Boh in Baltimore)."
buccos,3ci34n,TheRealO-H-I-O,2,Wed Jul 8 14:35:55 2015 UTC,"Beer  If you're from outside of the Pittsburgh/PA area, you need to try one of the hugely overpriced Yuengling (pronounced ""Ying-Ling"") beers available pretty much anywhere in the stadium. On top of that, give an Iron City (pronounced ""Iron City"") a try if you're looking at trying some local mass-produced-but-still-beloved swill. If you want to get involved with some of the local craft beers, ""Beers of the Burgh"" on the first base side of the main course has you covered. They feature a rotating selection of the finest overpriced hops you can get in the whole city."
buccos,3ci34n,drunkenviking,4,Wed Jul 8 04:04:43 2015 UTC,"I was pretty sure Iron City was pronounced ""Arn City"""
buccos,3ci34n,Sgt_Hatred5263,3,Wed Jul 8 19:58:13 2015 UTC,2.50 beer after the game at the rivertowne above the left field seats. Plenty of selection
buccos,3ci34n,AMcMahon1,2,Wed Jul 8 05:09:08 2015 UTC,You can park for free by the park/Giant Eagle in the northside.  If you're scared of black people or a young teenaged girl by yourself this probably isn't a good idea.  I usually just park at the Casino now but if you're headed north after the game you can't beat the ease of leaving.

buccos,3ci34n,judehaz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:44:22 2015 UTC,"I make it to a good number of games a year so:  Tickets/Seating: Go third base side for the view if it's your first time. Great view of the city especially at a night game right before it goes dark. If you're going to a day game you probably want to sit 1st base side so you can get some shade. You can also get a standing room only ticket and walk around. The Rotunda is fun to watch the game from if you get there early. There's always a crowd at the budweiser bar but if you go to the Rivertown hall of fame club there's standing seats outside of it above the bleachers. Plus you have easy access to good beer. Note: Upper grandstand tickets cost as much as SRO usually so you might want to get one just in case you want to sit down.  Before the Game: Bars on Federal street right outside the stadium are going to be packed on game days. Grab a beer from them (usually a couple have beer stands set up outside) and walk around federal street. Go see the statues. If you want to go to a bar the ones on N Shore Drive are going to be less Busy. Rivertown has a nice selection of beers and McFaddens is usually busy but no so much that you won't be able to get beer.  After the game: Head to the Rivertown hall of fame club in the stadium for some 2.50 beers. Let the traffic settle down a bit. I often like to head across the Clemente bridge then and hit up one of the bars on 6th St. McFaddens is pretty nice or if you want to have some fun, drink on the roof at Six Penn Kitchen. It's classy inside but not many people know about the roof.  At the Park: Watch the game.  Eating inside the Park: There's a nice foodcourt behind section 128. There's a bunch of random places there also a beer vendor with the microbrews. There's also a Primanti's and BRGR in the stadium as well as a Rita's. In center field you will see Manny's which is Manny Sanguillen's place. He's usually there talking with customers and he'll usually sign autographs for you if you ask.  Beer: The main place to get good beer is the Rivertown hall of fame club but you'll probably only get there after the game. The new bar underneath the rotunda has a pretty good selection as does the place up in the 300 level behind the stands basically straight behind home plate. Budweiser bar isn't as good but if you want mixed drinks they're good for that. Any of the bars serve after the 7th inning so if you're in extra innings might want to head to one of them. Other than that all the food places will have beer, might have to go to a couple if you have a preference between Bud/Miller Lite/IC Light. There's also little vendors scattered around that have Microbrews."
buccos,3ci34n,apaq11,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:20:02 2015 UTC,Before the game  go out to center field and look for Manny's grille. The one and only Manny Sanguillen is out there from time to time signing autographs and talking to fans. My dad even got to talk to him about his days in Columbus once. Very nice guy.
buccos,3ci34n,mypantsRoffrightnow,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:05:23 2015 UTC,"Tickets/Seating   I always use StubHub, mainly because I dislike playing fees.   Sit on the 3rd baseline if you've never been to the park, otherwise anywhere is great. The 100's are my go-to sections.   Parking   Head to Ft. Duquesne & 6th and grab a spot in the garage for like $7. The walk across the Clemente bridge is worth it, especially after a win. Bonus tip: There's a store connected to the garage that sells Pirates shirts for decent prices and they sometimes have really cool designs.   Before/After The Game   This is my specialty, I live a few hours away so we always go up to Pittsburgh early to do stuff before the game.  Kayaking in front of PNC Park  Carnegie Science Center (check the exhibits/shows before you go, I've went and had tons of fun and I've went and it's been meh.)  PNC Park Tour  The arcade on Carson Street  The Zoo (my favorite part is the escalators)  The strip district is kind of fun, but it's been crowded when I go and I'm not a fan of people.  Walk along the river and over the bridge  The incline  Eating Outside The Park   I like Quaker Steak & Lube and the Bettis Grill. Avoid Mullen's like the plague, the food is meh and the service is horrible. Primanti's is okay, try it at least once.   At The Park   Make sure you hit up the prize wheel, there's one on the concourse in center field and at least one other.   If you're in the park early enough trek to the top of the rotunda.   Don't play on your phone during the game. JUST DON'T.   Eating Inside The Park   Crab fries are good. Manny's is good. Souvenir cups are good."

buccos,3ch0uc,migosversace121,4,Tue Jul 7 21:06:46 2015 UTC,"Polanco to me seems like a head case of sorts. He's showing signs of what Pedro was when he was first called up but the consensus seemed to be that he'll breakout out of it and be successful. Well we all know Pedro has found his niche hitting homers against righties but never really outgrew his growing pains. I fear the same for Polanco. Both have long swings and power potential. I get that they're different players with different skill sets but it's almost a dejavu.   That being said I still believe in Polanco and feel that the best way for him to get going is to play him everyday. I just don't know if that should be against MLB talent or AAA talent. Fact of the matter is, the Buccos may have their best opportunity to gain ground on the Cards coming up and with the trade deadline fast approaching its hard to imagine competing with the Cards and Cubs down the stretch with a .230 hitter with less than 5 homers. He's been hurting the team more than helping the team lately and if you're Clint Hurdle you have to be running out of patience with the kid.   Harrison's and Marte's injuries don't help either and combined with Tabata's ""issues"" for lack of a better word, the time is now, in my opinion, to make a move and solidify right field."
buccos,3ch0uc,brianwood65,4,Tue Jul 7 22:24:03 2015 UTC,"Fact of the matter is, the Buccos may have their best opportunity to gain ground on the Cards coming up and with the trade deadline fast approaching its hard to imagine competing with the Cards and Cubs down the stretch with a .230 hitter with less than 5 homers.   Matt Adams is batting .243 this season. The Cards don't magically have a full team of guys batting .300. It's hilarious that the Pirates have the second best record in baseball and ""it's hard to imagine them competing"" because of one player. The Cardinals have a 2.56 overall ERA and the Pirates have a 2.88, so I guess they can't compete either because of Locke?  Give me a break. The Cards are having a historical season and are due to slow down. The Pirates are fine. How did the Oakland A's do last year after dominating the first half of the season?"
buccos,3ch0uc,tonytroz,3,Wed Jul 8 00:36:33 2015 UTC,"The Cardinals have proven that they can overcome injuries. The Pirates now have their own opportunity to prove it. But the Cards are a better, more balanced team than the Pirates. St. Louis isn't nearly as streaky, has consistent hitters and as deep a rotation as the Pirates. Head to head I give it to the Cards right now but hell, if the Pirates can add another bat, perhaps in right, it could give them the edge.   All I'm saying is that I doubt the Pirates can't overtake the Cardinals with Polanco in right at his current pace.  EDIT: And of course he hits a triple to knock in the go-ahead run. You go, Polanco!"
buccos,3ch0uc,brianwood65,2,Wed Jul 8 01:08:05 2015 UTC,"Almost all prospects ever bust/don't live up to their hype. If he can generate 1 WAR a year for the rest of his pre-arb years, he will have been a great player. Also, as you mention, he's 23"
buccos,3ch0uc,npcdel,0,Tue Jul 7 21:56:50 2015 UTC,"I think that be fine for a guy who didn't have Polanco's expectations, but he was a consensus top five prospect when he was called up. Some publications even had him as the #1 prospect in baseball. If he were like, the #64 prospect, yeah being a 1 WAR player is great, but  not for guys ranked as highly as Polanco.  And then you look around baseball and see other top prospects success. Carlos Correa, age 20, already with a WAR of 1.5 in just 25 ML games. Kris Bryant, age 23, already with a WAR of 3.5 in just 70+ career big league games. Joc Pederson, age 23, with a WAR of 3.4 in about 100 career games.

Cole had almost the exact same hype and now could be starting the all-star game. Baseball is very random, that's why top players are worth multiple top prospects.  Look at what Cutch and Marte did. Those are our Correa/Bryant's. There aren't many of them. You can ALWAYS cherry pick the top ones to compare to the ones that haven't or will never make it.  Sky high expectations ruin lots of young players. Polanco still has plenty of time to catch up to them. He hasn't even played 1 full season in the majors yet."
buccos,3ch0uc,DTX180,0,Wed Jul 8 00:31:06 2015 UTC,"Taillon's reasoning for not making an impact is injuries though. Yes baseball is random, but Polanco's struggles are much different from Taillon's"

Some more than others, but still its plenty of names.  http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=taillo001jam  Going from the 8 to 11 range to the 26 to 31 range after Tommy John surgery....i just dont see how its comparable to Polanco's struggles at all....  Cole was a college experienced pitcher with NCAA World Series tournament experience. Taillon never had college experience. Sure hes only a year younger, and should be in the majors by now (and would be if he didnt have injuries), but Cole definitely was a bigger name going into the draft."
buccos,3ch0uc,tonytroz,-1,Wed Jul 8 15:46:39 2015 UTC,"The point wasn't to compare it to Polanco's struggles, the point was that no matter how highly ranked or hyped a top prospect is there's no guarantee they're going to be that 1.5+ WAR player (especially in the first full year). That would put him in the top 75 or so players in the league and even if he was batting .270 he might not be the 3rd best on the Pirates. That's why expectations are way too high."
buccos,3ch0uc,PhantomJB93,2,Wed Jul 8 16:34:08 2015 UTC,"One thing I don't get is why we've insisted for so long to bench him against lefties.  I get that he's struggling even against righties but all throughout his development there was praise for his ability to hit lefties as well.  He's not going to get better at it if we don't let him try.  I definitely agree that AAA will do him no good.  When a guy gets to the point where he just crushes AAA like he did to become one of the top prospects in baseball, there's nothing else he's gonna learn there.  He'll either work out his issues here or bust.  I guess it could be a ""confidence boost"" if nothing else, but those expecting him to go down and learn some magic secret that makes him a major league All Star I think are kidding themselves.  Anyway I get that prospects struggle and he's young and can improve and yadda yadda yadda.  For the type of crazy-good prospect he was praised as for years, the simple fact is, through a little over a full season of games he has been an extreme disappointment.  There have been brief stretches of time where he has shown what he's capable of but they have been very brief and very spread out.  I didn't expect him to come out batting .300 out of the gate but certainly at least being able to contribute .250 or so without being the near-automatic pop/groundout he's been would have been nice to see in his first full year.  The fact that he's been a complete clusterfuck on the basepaths certainly hasn't helped either.  He's got the speed to be a stealing threat but that doesn't matter when he takes horrible angles and slides off the bag half the time."
buccos,3ch0uc,Joshduman,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:00:27 2015 UTC,"To me, if seems his week pitch lately has been fastballs. Not hitting fastballs could explain week contact. Maybe I'm wrong, but a fastball strikes me as a pitch a professional player might just need to adjust too. I'm still feeling fine."
buccos,3ch0uc,ns156,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:02:01 2015 UTC,"He's already proven that he can mash it against AAA pitchers, so I don't see what sending him down would do to help his game."
buccos,3ch0uc,MoreThanWards,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:53:00 2015 UTC,"They've got to be working with him to shorten his swing a bit, right now it's just so long and loopy that his rhythm is very hit or miss. Tonight's triple was a great example of a compact swing from him, stayed on the ball, drove it with power.  He needs to learn to look for his pitch, and not whatever pitch he's getting. That will come with time and experience. I'm not worried about this guy at all."
buccos,3ch0uc,ha7on,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:22:23 2015 UTC,"For a guy that wants to get paid, he isn't helping his own cause. He needs to get his head out of his ass. I think he has ""it"", but maybe he's putting too much pressure on himself? I really hope he figures it out soon and ends up staying another 5 years."

buccos,3cg5ve,rolobrowntowntony,2,Tue Jul 7 18:42:58 2015 UTC,Depends what your into but Gaucho in the strip has one of the best burgers in the city.   The original Primantis in the strip is a classic.   You can go to the Original Oyster House to get a giant fish sandwich and a breaded oyster in market square (one of my dad and I's traditions)   There's a bunch of street food in the strip too.
buccos,3cg5ve,OHVespista,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:48:47 2015 UTC,"Just this last week when I was there we went to Colangelo's on the strip and had fantastic Italian sandwiches/salads and that kind of thing.

buccos,3cg5ve,witzelsuchty,4,Tue Jul 7 17:54:24 2015 UTC,"I always suggest checking out the views of the city from Mt Washington. It's an easy 2 minute incline ride from station square, across a bridge from town."
buccos,3cg5ve,OHVespista,4,Tue Jul 7 18:30:47 2015 UTC,"I have a list I made before with my suggestions, I'll find it when I'm not on my phone.   Edit: Found it! Some of it doesn't necessarily apply to you but I'll post the whole thing.    I prefer sitting down the baselines, there's not a bad seat in the house. The best Pittsburgh skyline view is between 3rd base and and the plate though and I'd recommend anyone visiting PNC Park for the first time sit where they have the great view.  As far as activities go, here's a list I gave to someone in the GDT the other day.  Kayaking in front of PNC Park  Carnegie Science Center (check the exhibits/shows before you go, I've went and had tons of fun and I've went and it's been meh.) PNC Park Tour  The arcade on Carson Street  The Zoo (my favorite part is the escalators)  The strip district is kind of fun, but it's been crowded when I go and I'm not a fan of people.  Walk along the river and over the bridge, especially before/after the game  The incline is fun too  My advice is to avoid eating at Mullen's Bar and Grill, the service was terrible and the food was meh. Bettis Grille is pretty delicious though and service is always great. Personally I am not a fan of Primanti's (I know, I know) but Quaker Steak and Lube has fantastic wings.  Make sure you drive into the city at least once through the Fort-Pitt Tunnel, it's really incredible no matter the time of day.  Kennywood is pretty close if you're a fan of roller coasters.  Ohiopyle/Falling Waters is on the way to the park depending on how you come in/leave Pittsburgh."

Josh Harrison's 9 errors with a .947 fielding percentage (.962 for his career) At third base alone.  Almost as bad as Pedro last year (in terms of errors).  Even worse he is 3rd in the NL in total errors.  Kang with 3 errors in 85 chances at third with a .965 fielding percentage (short stop is worse) In his pretty small sample size.. I'm hoping a larger sample will show he is better.
buccos,3cc63z,maltrab,4,Mon Jul 6 20:28:20 2015 UTC,"Errors are not a good stat for telling how good of a fielder you are. Example. Player X has 100 balls hit to him. He only gets to 70 of them, but he converts all 70 of those balls into outs. Then Player Y has the same 100 balls hit to him. He gets to all 100, but only converts 80 into outs with the rest counting as errors (assume the rest where just off his glove and no throwing errors). Player X will have the higher fielding percentage, but who is the better fielder? That will be player Y"
buccos,3cc63z,redrage97,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:31:51 2015 UTC,thats not i base it on but it is the biggest glaring stat.
buccos,3cc63z,maltrab,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:46:03 2015 UTC,Issue is it is unreliable at best. Exactly because of the scenario.
buccos,3cc63z,redrage97,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:50:36 2015 UTC,"go back and watch the dozen or so games around the time Locke Melted down and had 9 runs score.  Pretty sure only 4 where earned.  In those games where it looked like the pitching was regressing it was just as much the defense as it was the pitching.  It seemed like every infielder just gave up too early soft rollers through the infield with a third baseman and short stop just standing around watching it roll, at least stop the ball so they don't turn what should've been a close play at first into a double.  What stat measures that because there for at least a week he would've been the league leader with mercer and walker not far behind.  It was pretty bad though denieing it doesn't make it untrue.  Though Except this thread... i havn't been complaining about it as much lately so maybe it was the weather"
buccos,3cc63z,bassmachinejon,3,Tue Jul 7 15:05:21 2015 UTC,"I mean, if errors is the only stat we're going with here, let's compare Alvarez at 3rd base in 2014 to Harrison at 3rd base in 2015. Alvarez played 99 games at 3rd last year and accounted for 25 errors. If we round that up to 100 games and divide the errors, it means Pedro accounted for .25 errors per game. Multiply that by 162 games (which he obviously did not play but for the sake of this argument, lets say he did), it gives us 40.5 errors over an entire season.  Josh Harrison this year has accounted for 9 errors at 3rd base. Divide that by the 56 games he has played at 3rd base this year, it gives us .16 errors per game. If he keeps that going for an entire season of 162 games (which at this point, is obviously not possible), he would still end up with roughly 26 errors in the entire season.   Basing all of this information on errors alone (which can be a misleading stat, not unlike RBIs), Harrison is by far the much superior defensive 3rd baseman. However, there are many more advanced stats that further prove my point. I'm not discrediting your argument and I am not trying to start any arguments. I am only providing you with a solid counter claim to you saying that ""has been stinking it up at third this year."" Quite frankly, he's league average at the position. Far away from stinking it up. To say that his loss won't hurt the team is very shortsighted."

buccos,3cbiom,drunkenviking,3,Mon Jul 6 21:37:32 2015 UTC,People in this town will never be satisfied with Pedro unless he's hitting .270 with 40 HR every year. Never mind that he's cut down on his strikeouts and increased his walks.
buccos,3cbiom,Alch_Fox,5,Mon Jul 6 23:36:33 2015 UTC,"Pedro is kind of in a reformation period at the plate. He's hitting balls the other way, is actually hitting balls that are in different parts of the strikezone other than inside, isn't swinging for the fence every at bat, isn't looking for fast ball every pitch. We're seeing a whole new Pedro. THe problem though, is when someone changes their approach at the plate, it doesn't happen overnight. It'll take time before everything really clicks. That'll probably happen after Pedro is gone, but right now, we should be happy that he isn't just striking out on 3 pitches anymore. He's no longer the easy out he used to be."

buccos,3camac,AaadamPgh,3,Mon Jul 6 12:19:55 2015 UTC,"Cervelli if the NL squad carries more than two catchers (Yadier will be the primary backup, obviously). Or he can be a backup DH with his .300+ BA. But even if he doesn't get in, 4 All-Stars is pretty good."
buccos,3camac,Vitosi4ek,3,Mon Jul 6 13:15:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I had to look back to last year to check, but it looks like 2 catchers is typical."
buccos,3camac,Gameroomvids,2,Mon Jul 6 13:55:28 2015 UTC,"Obviously Cutch. I would be shocked if Melancon gets snubbed. I'm confident about Cole and 80% sure Burnett gets in. At the very least, Batman should be an option for the fan vote. I don't think Cervelli will make it because of his lack of homers and rbi (although I think he deserves it). With the number of outfielders hurt, I think there is at least a shot that Marte makes the team (but I would only give it about a 1 in 4 chance)."
buccos,3camac,tonytroz,2,Mon Jul 6 16:01:58 2015 UTC,I don't think we'll get 2 SPs if Melancon makes it. All three are certainly deserving though. Cervelli and Marte are both having great seasons but the competition at those spots is too tough for a borderline all-star first half (also both had pretty weak Aprils like the rest of the team which holds their stats back). Cutch also had a terrible April and probably gets snubbed if it wasn't for his reputation and the team's success.  Will be interesting to see how it plays out. 4 players would certainly be a good haul.  Edit: Glad I was wrong. With 3 catchers Cervelli is a huge snub though.
buccos,3camac,volleypuck,2,Mon Jul 6 17:24:11 2015 UTC,"I agree about the pitchers, but I think Burnett will be added after today once other pitchers start dropping off for injury/opt-out reasons."

buccos,3c8tf7,ns156,18,Sun Jul 5 23:48:32 2015 UTC,"Pitchers aside, McCutchen was the only player who I could say might have deserved to start. His slow start didn't help his cause."
buccos,3c8tf7,jwt155,10,Mon Jul 6 02:02:45 2015 UTC,Cervelli has the best resume and a solid case for being a starter at the All Star game.
buccos,3c8tf7,maltrab,20,Mon Jul 6 02:15:27 2015 UTC,"Not over Buster Posey though. Cervelli is a deserving all-star, but not as a starter over Posey"
buccos,3c8tf7,jwt155,2,Mon Jul 6 02:16:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I just think Cervelli has a much better resume then Cutch. Molina sadly has the name and the reputation and will be the backup."
buccos,3c8tf7,maltrab,4,Mon Jul 6 02:18:32 2015 UTC,"Yes but Cervelli isn't competing against McCutchen for a spot though, he's competing against Posey and Molina................"
buccos,3c8tf7,jwt155,2,Mon Jul 6 02:22:14 2015 UTC,"Op said only Mccutchen is the only Bucco who should be in contention for a spot at the All Star Game, i disagree and think Cervelli has a great resume."
buccos,3c8tf7,maltrab,4,Mon Jul 6 02:51:45 2015 UTC,"He has a good resume sure, but he's not close to Posey. Really, no one is"
buccos,3c8tf7,jwt155,6,Mon Jul 6 03:09:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed. We're arguing 2 different things. Op said no one other than Cutch could make an argument for being in the All Star game, where as I think Cervelli does. Of course this season Posey is playing lights out but that doesn't take away from Cervellis performance. It's like interviewing people for a job position, person A can meet all of the requirements and be an excellent candidate even if person B has more work experience, better credentials, etc."

buccos,3c8tf7,IndridCipher,6,Mon Jul 6 04:05:16 2015 UTC,honestly i don't really think any of our players deserve to be a starter on the All-Star team this year.  No one has had a career year to this point and no one has been consistently good since the year started.  Cutch is great but his numbers are not top 3 outfielders in the league right now atleast from a popularity voting stand point.    Then you have our Pitchers who deserve some All Star bids but Cole is not starting nor should he start over Sherzer.  We are the third best record in all of baseball because we have depth and have played consistently pretty good baseball.  Not because we have a bunch of All-Star talented players having really good years.  We have a bunch of All-Star talented players having pretty mediocre years by there standards so far.  Atleast thats how i see it.
buccos,3c8tf7,Joshduman,8,Mon Jul 6 04:54:14 2015 UTC,"We will, Cutch will be a replacement. He's the only deserving one, anyways. Posey has been better than Cervelli."
buccos,3c8tf7,ThatguyJake,2,Sun Jul 5 23:57:57 2015 UTC,Oh we definitely will. But none officially voted in as starters. It's not truly a huge deal anyway but I'm annoyingly amused by it.
buccos,3c8tf7,witzelsuchty,15,Mon Jul 6 01:32:23 2015 UTC,It also goes to show how were just a good team.  We don't have anyone carrying us. Just a group of guys who do their job everyday and pick up others when they're having a rough patch.  That's how I see anyway.
buccos,3c8tf7,el_capitan_obvio,3,Mon Jul 6 01:37:27 2015 UTC,"Good point.   Honestly games like this make me nervous that someone will get hurt though. Every time my sisters softball team plays a ""fun"" game someone gets hurt."
buccos,3c8tf7,ns156,4,Mon Jul 6 02:12:44 2015 UTC,"In the past couple days, I have heard both Cutch and Cole talking about the lack of attention/coverage they and the team get because they play in a small media market.   We all know it's true...but I wonder how it really impacts the way superstars like that feel. Does it give them an even bigger chip on their shoulders that makes them play even harder, or does it motivate them to eventually get the credit elsewhere they feel they deserve?"
buccos,3c8tf7,el_capitan_obvio,2,Mon Jul 6 01:56:55 2015 UTC,"This news doesn't include pitchers, just FYI."
buccos,3c8tf7,Followthatmonkey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:04:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thanks. I realize that. My question is more of a general one about the psyche of a superstar player in a small market and whether that perceived lack of respect/attention can be additional motivation for him to stay or leave. The ASG is just one of the more obvious places where those biases are evident."
buccos,3c8tf7,OHVespista,3,Mon Jul 6 02:21:29 2015 UTC,"I mean, Cutch made the cover of MLB The Show a couple years back, making him literally the cover boy for the league that year. Its not that stars in small markets don't get covered, its just that this year no one has the stats to warrent it."
buccos,3c8tf7,el_capitan_obvio,2,Mon Jul 6 02:27:10 2015 UTC,"Good question and point. The media market size discourse always confuses me a bit, since St. Louis is generally considered a small media market - and if we move outside of baseball, so is Green Bay - yet these teams get plenty of attention...as do the Steelers.   I guess that prolonged success trumps media market size?"
buccos,3c8tf7,OHVespista,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:30:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe. I just found it curious that our two best players were both saying the same thing within 24 hours of each other. Both Cutch and Cole are real competitors, and I tend to believe they will latch onto anything that will give them that extra edge."
buccos,3c8tf7,el_capitan_obvio,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:41:40 2015 UTC,I think you're spot-on about that.
buccos,3c8tf7,tonytroz,2,Mon Jul 6 02:46:37 2015 UTC,"I hope so. The risk is that they will eventually feel that lack of attention is turning into lost opportunities for bigger/better contracts, endorsement deals, etc.   This is a weird time in the history of the team. We're competitive and we have legitimate superstar players. We haven't really had to think about how to treat players of that caliber for a really long time."
buccos,3c8tf7,kmhokies35,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:36:31 2015 UTC,"I guess that prolonged success trumps media market size?   It does, as can star players. People will still use the small market in arguments (Roethlisberger doesn't get respect as an elite QB because he's not in Boston!) but when they're winning the media jumps all over them.  Also, the Steelers especially have a great national presence that transcends the Pittsburgh market. Same with Sidney Crosby himself."

buccos,3c809v,grasspuddle,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:12:45 2015 UTC,"Mostly a depth move.  The Pirates have NO first basemen close to ready for the MLB just players converted to first basemen the past year or two.  Travis is a good glove and not horrible at the plate.  Gives the Pirates an option to move Sean to another position or move another infielder to another team.  I'm talking about Kang, Mercer, Walker,Harrison, Hanson mostly here but Pedro as well.  If anything I'd say it more of a sign that Pedro is on his way out.  Even though I think Pedro is getting much better at the plate (on pace for a career low in strike outs) It is getting hard to carry his defense."
buccos,3c809v,redrage97,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:00:22 2015 UTC,His defense is perfectly acceptable for a guy who's played the position for less than a year. He's getting better every day.
buccos,3c809v,drunkenviking,3,Mon Jul 6 18:07:26 2015 UTC,assuming talking about Pedro.  understandable yes... acceptable no not at the MLB level. I do agree over all he is getting better in all aspects of his game but by the time he is actually average he will be a free agent.

buccos,3c7873,victims_sanction,3,Sun Jul 5 17:04:15 2015 UTC,"When I was little I wore those high, thick socks from the early 90s all the time, then I'd roll them down so they looked like donuts. Maybe it's all related?"
buccos,3c7873,witzelsuchty,4,Sun Jul 5 17:19:42 2015 UTC,I just realized that the Bucs have 3 starters with an ERA in the 2s. Morton has the highest ERA on the staff at 4.30. There was a time where 4.30 would be the #2 starter

buccos,3c7873,Gameroomvids,2,Sun Jul 5 16:56:31 2015 UTC,If they give up Frazier I'll be shocked. Seems like he's the bright spot in their team and he's fairly young right? I'd figure they'd build around him.

buccos,3c4q2d,jmb_412,3,Sat Jul 4 19:43:25 2015 UTC,Diaz might even be ready now. There's just no need for him because Cervelli is playing well.
buccos,3c4q2d,maltrab,2,Sun Jul 5 00:10:24 2015 UTC,I'd say Diaz joins the team as a 3rd catcher when rosters expand in September.
buccos,3c4q2d,Baseball_dusty,2,Sun Jul 5 16:23:27 2015 UTC,"At the very least. I'd imagine soon if Cervelli or Stewart get hurt. Even ignoring Cervelli's injury history, we have had a catcher injured every year in the past 3 at least. Probably longer."
buccos,3c4q2d,maltrab,2,Sun Jul 5 16:26:18 2015 UTC,"Idk about  Diaz, but the pirates are usually pretty determined to get position players 1 full year in triple a before calling them up. They made an exception with polanco, and he's struggling this year, which will make Huntington more weary of calling someone up too early again."
buccos,3c4q2d,IamNotYourBuddy,4,Sun Jul 5 04:17:32 2015 UTC,"If he keeps up this production all season long, I think he would command about $5 or $6 mil in free agency.   An under 30 catcher who can hit and play solid defense is something a lot of teams would overpay for (see Russell Martin).   Wouldn't surprise me to see Pirates resign him to a 2 year deal while Diaz and McGuire develop.  My prediction: 2 year, $11 million"
buccos,3c4q2d,Kodyak77,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:30:13 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong but Cervelli's a free agent after this season, right?  He's a strong defensive catcher with a BA that is elite for a catcher.  He's also able to finally make some real money. If he finishes the season healthy and still swinging a hot bat,  someone will give him much more than $6.5M/year over two years."
buccos,3c4q2d,fishbulb00,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:37:47 2015 UTC,We'll see. He doesn't have the power that Russell Martin has and no where near the consistency. Committing to a player long-term after one good season is risky. GM's are smarter than that.   By 'much more' are you saying Cervelli warrants $10 mil a year?   I don't see that happening.
buccos,3c4q2d,Kodyak77,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:16:53 2015 UTC,"Cervelli is actually free agent after the 2016 season. I'd say if he puts up 2 healthy years at the 3+ WAR per year level he has right now,not even counting pitch framing, $10 million per is pretty realistic."
buccos,3c4q2d,ginbear,3,Sun Jul 5 22:24:49 2015 UTC,"His catching was never in question it's always been his ability to make it through a full season.  If he does then I could see talks, but as of now he's still got to prove himself."
buccos,3c4q2d,IONTOP,2,Sat Jul 4 20:18:35 2015 UTC,"With Elias Diaz coming soon, I don't see a starting future for Cervelli. At best, a platoon like Slaught/Lavalliere or Nicosia/Ott."
buccos,3c4q2d,Bred-Rock,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:51:40 2015 UTC,"With Cervelli's injury history (knock on wood / basically every season prior to this year), I don't think any team would be willing to invest a large amount of money into him before a season or two of proving he can stay healthy & produce."
buccos,3c4q2d,AaadamPgh,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:45:06 2015 UTC,Doesn't he have another year of arbitration?
buccos,3c4q2d,k__e__n,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:39:11 2015 UTC,"If he says healthy through the season offer him a very team friendly contract with a lot of bonuses for playing time in the off season. He will probably refuse.   Stewart will then probably sign a 1 or 2 year deal for the '17/18 seasons.  A healthy Cervelli's price tag at this performance so far this year is probably closer to $8-10 million.. i'd probably offer 2 year $5-6 million with nice bonuses for 300-400-500-600 Plate appearances and other awards. and a team option for a 3rd year with a 1 million buyout.  That's just based on performance this year and his injury history  Stewart, Sanchez, Diaz, McGuire among others should all be close or near mlb ready and handle the job in '16/17  Diaz will probably see time in September and Sanchez will be back when Cervelli or Stewart get injured."
buccos,3c24bo,ericfg,11,Sat Jul 4 01:32:36 2015 UTC,"So while we get regular QS's from AJ, Cole and Frankie we gotta remember that two of them ain't getting any younger.   Liriano is only 31, just signed a 3 year deal, and actually has better stats right now than he did in 2013. Wouldn't worry too much about him. The Burnett spot is going to hurt next season, but they will get Cumpton back and should be able to spend Burnett's money to get a veteran replacement. Even with the prospect injuries at least one should be available at some point next year (probably 2nd half). The future certainly isn't bleak unless one of the starters goes down long term.   Also, we got the Locke/Morton toss-up every 4th and 5th day. Who knows what'll happen with these two: it might be a QS, it might be a meltdown   That's every #4 and #5 pitcher in baseball in a nutshell. Even the 2014 Tigers after the Price trade (arguably one of the best rotations ever) had a 4.54 ERA Verlander which is .01 better than Locke's 4.55. Everyone on this board needs to stop exaggerating about how 5th starters should be aces.  Also not really fair to lump Morton in with the ""might be a meltdown"" talk based on 2015. He's had one bad start and one mediocre start, the other 5 were more than solid. His 2014 and 2013 were solid statistical seasons for a #4 guy, and he was forced into a #3 role for much of that time.   Any of these five get hurt and we turn the Worley and Liz??? God help us...   The Pirates know this. I'm sure they're scouting out potential trades for starters. The problem is the contracts. Locke and Worley are out of options so you pretty much lose them if you replace them now. I'm sure they'll wait to see how July plans out before making a move. Locke had a sub-3 ERA June, so if he continues to pitch like he did last month and everyone stays healthy they won't need to force a move.  TL;DR - The sky isn't falling. The future rotations aren't sabotaged to the point of failure by the injuries. The Pirates aren't purposely neglecting the rotation just because they lost some depth. Sit back and enjoy what is arguably the best rotation in baseball."
buccos,3c24bo,tonytroz,6,Sat Jul 4 04:00:49 2015 UTC,"Everyone on this board needs to stop exaggerating about how 5th starters should be aces.   Yes please.   The existence and skill level of the average fifth starter is the penance one pays for being a baseball fan.  Like traffic and taxes, you just gotta learn to live with it."
buccos,3c24bo,killyouintheface,2,Sat Jul 4 04:30:57 2015 UTC,Only need 5 starters to get you to the playoffs then it's 3 in the playoffs.
buccos,3c24bo,Scoonz,3,Sat Jul 4 17:19:59 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping Cumpton recovers soon and can come back to the Bigs, he was always great up here but was unlucky because there was never enough room in the rotation for him to stay."
buccos,3c24bo,jwt155,5,Sat Jul 4 05:37:01 2015 UTC,Not good that he's missing 2 years of development. This has to hurt his prospect status even more than the Tommy John surgery.

buccos,3c1hmg,stargellstar,7,Sat Jul 4 22:48:22 2015 UTC,It just seems a little odd to only get cash. It was my understanding that he's a pretty good pitcher.
buccos,3c1hmg,Metroidman,5,Fri Jul 3 22:23:05 2015 UTC,"I guess it was a contractual thing: ""The Pirates made good on their promise and intent when they came to a Minor League agreement on Dec. 3 with veteran lefty Clayton Richard: to work him back to the Major Leagues.  Richard is coming, but not to the Pirates, who on Friday honored the ""upward mobility"" clause in his contract by trading him to the Cubs for cash considerations.""  His numbers in AAA were quite good, aside from a low, 4.02 SO9 rate.  He has a 1.18 WHIP.  Before he got hurt he was a fairly good 3rd or 4th starter for the Padres.  When I saw he was going to a NL Central team I figured we'd have gotten a fairly decent return.  Turns out it's for a couple boxes of new balls.  Strange."
buccos,3c1hmg,Aaron15063,0,Sat Jul 4 01:09:16 2015 UTC,"Despite his good numbers in AAA, the Pirates must not have been impressed what they saw in him.  Otherwise they would have found a place for him on the roster.  I think this shows how weak and desperate the Cubs are concerning the back end of their rotation.  Trying to be positive here!"

buccos,3c1hmg,cytopathic_effect,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:27:01 2015 UTC,"Not overly impressive last time in the majors, and that was at San Diego. ERA around 2 in AAA, but only 4K/9 so not sure how well it'll translate to the majors."
buccos,3c1hmg,tonytroz,-5,Sat Jul 4 01:55:45 2015 UTC,God damnit.. Why didn't they just call him up? He can't be worse than Locke.
buccos,3c1hmg,cytopathic_effect,6,Fri Jul 3 22:36:22 2015 UTC,Because it's a stupid move. Locke is out of options and is pretty useless in the pen with Watson and Bastardo. Richard's career ERA is worse than Locke's and he had a 7+ ERA last time he pitched in the majors. AAA numbers don't necessarily translate to anything and Locke had a June ERA under 3. You can't just dump him as there is no rotation depth due to all the prospect injuries. Richard's contract forced this move.
buccos,3c1hmg,TheRWGamer,12,Sat Jul 4 00:28:48 2015 UTC,There is a contingent of Pirate baseball fans that don't understand that your 4th and 5th starters aren't gonna put up a sub 3.00 ERA. Same people who think Charlie Morton sucks.
buccos,3c1hmg,iamnotacola,7,Sat Jul 4 01:17:16 2015 UTC,"Yep. Pirates are above .500 in Locke's games. That's really all you can ask for. If your rotation is healthy your 5th starter never pitches a game in the playoffs.   Locke is only 27 and has shown all-star potential. Almost every team in the league would love to have a guy like that at the back end of their rotation, even when he's struggling. He's also not a power guy so he could still improve and pitch well into his 30s like Morton who's worth $7M a year."
buccos,3c1hmg,TheRWGamer,4,Sat Jul 4 01:25:57 2015 UTC,"I think Locke's difficulties stem from the fact that he's a nibbler, and when he isn't getting calls he pitches to contact (as is the Buccos pitching philosophy) and he ends up getting rocked. But, when he hits his spots he is very effective."

If a Pirate gets hit, the other pitcher needs to be able to reign it in when he throws inside, and avoid hitting guys otherwise retaliation should be imminent whether it was intentional or otherwise  When a Pirate hits a guy, they were just trying to work the inner half, and it got away from him and these things happen."

buccos,3bzmyk,zylaxice,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:35:50 2015 UTC,I always thought the Cubs broadcast had the weirdest angles.
buccos,3bzmyk,Chris-T,2,Sat Jul 4 01:24:34 2015 UTC,We have the camera directly behind homeplate instead of offset (which a lot of parks have) if that's what you mean.
buccos,3bzmyk,zylaxice,2,Fri Jul 3 23:36:44 2015 UTC,"Is that a new thing? I was trying to compare the camera angles and some articles from 2-ish years ago show a really extreme angle, but obviously it's dead center now."

buccos,3bzmyk,Ikarise,2,Fri Jul 3 23:47:17 2015 UTC,I was more thinking the angle on the single and also Moss' homer
buccos,3bzmyk,MrReality13,2,Fri Jul 3 23:38:12 2015 UTC,its so much better. i hate the offset angle.
buccos,3bzmyk,LaPenta5594,3,Fri Jul 3 23:37:31 2015 UTC,It's so much better to know when the umpire is garbage.
buccos,3bzmyk,IamNotYourBuddy,2,Fri Jul 3 23:39:05 2015 UTC,"I do too, once you watch all your game from this angle (where you can perfectly see the strikezone) it sucks to watch from offset."
buccos,3bzmyk,unoriginalRambone,2,Fri Jul 3 23:38:44 2015 UTC,yeah our's is usually offset and it really annoys me. i really feel it gives you a false perception of the strikezone which therefore leads me to undeserved rage with the umpire.

buccos,3bwwpt,patstuart2,8,Thu Jul 2 21:45:04 2015 UTC,"I really think they should reorganize the playoff structure. If you win your division, you should make the playoffs but if a wildcard team has more wins than a division winner they shouldn't have to play in the wildcard game."
buccos,3bwwpt,purplepenned,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:47:03 2015 UTC,"Back in the good ol' days, you had to win your division, and there were only four total divisions. I remember the Giants winning 103 games one year and not making the playoffs because Atlanta beat them out.  Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_San_Francisco_Giants_season  And before THAT (1969) you had to win your league, period. No divisional round at all."
buccos,3bwwpt,patstuart2,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:37:29 2015 UTC,Having Atlanta and San Francisco be in the same division sounds like a logistical pain in the ass. So many pricy plane trips.
buccos,3bwwpt,9000miles,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:00:35 2015 UTC,It was. Atlanta and Cincinnati got stuck in the NL West while St. Louis and Chicago were in the NL East. The reasons were purely political too (something to do with keeping the Mets happy... not sure what).  That arrangement existed for 25 years.
buccos,3bwwpt,ns156,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:21:05 2015 UTC,"No way. Then you'd be forcing a division winner to play in the wild card game. At that point, why even have divisions? Might as well just have one 15-team division in the NL and take the top five."
buccos,3bwwpt,alphadelt,2,Fri Jul 3 02:28:14 2015 UTC,"I've had this debate with myself in other sports, too. On one hand, if you rank all playoff seeds by record instead of giving a home game/series to the division winners, you likely reward teams with inflated records from shitty divisions over teams with not-as-great-but-still-good records who had to slug it out in a tougher division.  On the other hand, it's total bullshit that teams like the Seahawks and Panthers got to host playoff games the first week of the postseason in the last couple of years with losing records(!!!) while a team with a 10-6 record didn't make the playoffs at all.   Ideally, I feel like there needs to be some other kind of way of sorting it out. I think if you're a wildcard team with both a better record overall and a better head-to-head record against a division winner, you get their playoff seed. This could work in baseball at least, right?   I'd care less if the wildcards weren't shafted with the one game bullshit where random chance plays such a big role, or gives a huge edge to the team with the best singular pitcher on the roster. A best of three or five series, would make the current seeding format nearly a non-issue."

buccos,3bvblg,Doublehalfpint,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:02:02 2015 UTC,Talk to us about these pitchers. I remember Bauer used to be a top prospect for the D-backs. Don't know much about Anderson. Salazar is your #2 right?
buccos,3bvblg,ajg2345,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:10:23 2015 UTC,"Well, our rotation doesn't go in order of ability as you would assume. Kluber is our 1 but after that the rotation is scrambled in terms of strength; I'd say Carrasco is our #2 probably followed by Bauer then Salazar, although they're interchangeable.  Basically our top three (Kluber Carrasco Bauer) were all unwanted and traded to us a while back, and our pitching coach Mickey Calloway has worked wonders with all of them in the developmental process. Bauer never really looked like that top prospect until this year, he's finally starting to look like what he's always been touted as. Salazar had control issues but now has like a 4:1 or 5:1 K:BB ratio. Anderson is our recent promotion and probably top pitching prospect that was left in the minors. He's a quality arm, but doesn't really have elite tools. Definitely more of a contact guy who won't get many K's and lets teams hit the ball, but does a good job of keeping them in the yard. High floor low ceiling type of guy.  Our rotation has had potential to be this good last year too, just now with more maturity and far less control issues they're becoming elite."

buccos,3btevu,pghgamecock,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:50:46 2015 UTC,It's at the point where when he gets excited for the opponents' fly balls I relax because I know they'll be caught.
buccos,3btevu,avar14,2,Thu Jul 2 05:42:57 2015 UTC,"I like him. He gets overshadowed a lot by the fact Brown is so exuberant and kind of a homer, but I think Neverett has a good voice, and can get excited when it's appropriate."
buccos,3btevu,montani,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:36:08 2015 UTC,"I like hearing Tim call a game once in awhile.  He's a little less.. biased (?) than Greg, but some people like a straight play-by-play call and some want an announcer who seems to be such a huge fan like Greg and dives into the ""color"" side of announcing.  I still think all of the announcers are great.  I watch/listen to a lot of other baseball during the year and I don't think any of the announcers from other markets do as good a job.  Obviously I'm biased, but I really think many markets are just pretty boring.  Bob Uecker was always fun to listen to, but once the Brewers moved to our division, less so."
buccos,3btevu,Tyze36,4,Thu Jul 2 19:52:31 2015 UTC,"I asked Robby Incmkowski on twitter, and he said they are good friends. My take is like others have said, Greg loves giving Bob a hard time."

buccos,3br9h6,jwt155,14,Wed Jul 1 16:19:36 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of fans dislike Jason Grilli because of his exit from the Pirates, but you can tell the dude loves Pittsburgh. I will forever like the dude for how vital he was to the 2013 team and how nice he was any time I interacted with him. This is a really touching tribute to Pittsburgh."
buccos,3br9h6,avar14,17,Wed Jul 1 14:42:36 2015 UTC,"I don't dislike him cause of his exit, I dislike his writing style. He comes across pompous and having a messiah complex. That being said, I do love Jason Grilli as a ballplayer, appreciate his efforts for the Pirates, and wish him the best of success in Atlanta and whatever may come next."
buccos,3br9h6,montani,0,Wed Jul 1 15:56:31 2015 UTC,I agree with you but I also understand why he is like that and why that is the only reason he never really washed out.
buccos,3br9h6,DTX180,0,Wed Jul 1 17:40:25 2015 UTC,"meh from what i understand he has that in his book. Not sure where in that particular article do you get that though, seemed rather normal to me."

There’s so much to do and so many good people to meet, and they all have such passion for everything they do, right down to their food and their art. Visit the Clemente Museum. Grab a sandwich at Primanti Bros. Hit the Strip District. I could go on all day…""    Pretty cool to hear this from a former player, and it's great the city made such a positive impact on him. Seems like there are a number of former players who wind up making Pittsburgh their home after their playing days are done."

buccos,3br1hn,avar14,2,Wed Jul 1 20:45:30 2015 UTC,You guys got the best of that deal.  I think Kessel got the short end of the Toronto media stick.    He might really thrive in Crosby and Malkin's shadow.  Your PP will be good...but I'm not sure who is playing D for you guys anymore.

buccos,3br1hn,Flying_Cs,2,Thu Jul 2 02:01:31 2015 UTC,"Wilkes-Barre defense.  If Bettman pushes for more expansion, we'll all have an AHL defense.  Still, this deal was one you couldn't pass up.  Not sure what Shanny was thinking, eating all that money on the deal.  And then the picks?  I mean, its not like Kessel was trying to import oxys or anything...  But your PP, or a late game ""power line"" will be cool for you guys.    Look forward to the match up. ."

buccos,3bmrws,hey_arnold93,0,Tue Jun 30 22:25:45 2015 UTC,"To be honest I'm perfectly fine with the Alvarez/Rodriguez platoon at first base.   In regards to the trade deadline I'd be more interested in the Pirates looking into a right field option. Polanco's struggles are perfectly normal and understandable, but come October I don't trust him in high-stress situations against playoff-caliber pitching.   Picking up someone like Josh Reddick would be amazing and could give be what we need to get past the NLDS.   That would also give us Polanco's speed in a late inning pinch runner situation."

If we could get goldschmidt, I would be okay moving bell for him. That's a no brainer. But in don't see any other 1B hopefuls in the trade market. Our only hope is Pedro gets hot. Which isn't likely."

buccos,3bmrws,maltrab,5,Tue Jun 30 23:16:38 2015 UTC,"While he has a high price tag that's ludicrous, no player is worth those guys."
buccos,3bmrws,TrueSouldier,2,Wed Jul 1 00:52:39 2015 UTC,"That's the type of package it would take to get Arizona to think about it though. He has the 3rd or 4th highest trade value in all of baseball behind Trout, Harper, and maybe Cutch. It is going to take a ransom and then some."
buccos,3bmrws,hey_arnold93,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:07:39 2015 UTC,"No it isn't. He has a high trade value but an Ace, an above average outfielder (who can still hit his ceiling), and three top prospects is ludicrous. It's just not the going rate, do you really think that Goldy is so good that you can deal your young bonafide ace as only part of the deal? That's hilariously undervaluing Cole.  I'm not saying we should go after him and it would take a considerable amount to get him but trading the top of the farm plus an ace plus an above average outfielder is so beyond what any player is worth that it's laughable."
buccos,3bmrws,AlbirdEinstein,-2,Fri Jul 3 13:29:23 2015 UTC,"I have no idea if he is or isn'. If you want to go down that rabbit hole I don't think it would be one for one. But if the question is would I make that deal, with bell as the center piece and a few tier c prospects, you'd be crazy to say no. It's fun to play GM and dream over trades like this, but people are really taking this thread too seriously. Trade speculation and dreaming happens on this sub every year around this team."
buccos,3bmrws,hey_arnold93,3,Wed Jul 1 00:42:44 2015 UTC,But Bell isn't even a top 100 prospect and you're talking about trading him for one of the best offensive players in the game right now!  I'll take one Kershaw for Pedro and some High A scrubs.

How does demoting a guy help him figure it out? He needs consistent playing time in the major leagues. We sent Polanco down late last year to ""get his head straight"" and it didn't work at all.  What Polanco needs to do is play everyday and shorten his swing."
buccos,3blun1,The_Notorious_HAM,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:30:09 2015 UTC,I'm not entirely sold on Polanco.  He makes too many bad mistakes.  The of market is meh at the deadline.  I think decker can put up the same numbers as Polanco without the bone headed mistakes.  Go for an rf (if decker doesn't perform like I think he can)  and a 1b in the off-season.  Hopefully I'm wrong about Polanco but from what I've seen his mental mistakes are horrendous.
buccos,3blun1,drunkenviking,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:39:25 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, he takes his at bats into the field with him. He lets his offensive struggles get to him which leads to him taking bad routes to the ball or being overly aggressive on the base paths. Its frustrating watching him struggle, but I'm confident he can work out of it.  You mentioned targeting a 1B and RF in the offseason. Im curious to hear who exactly you would target (I mean realistically, of course. The Pirates will not sign Upton).  Edit: I'm looking at the free agent list for the coming offseason. Encarnacion and Morneau's options will probably be picked up. So you're left with a 1B pool of:  Jeff Baker, Chris Davis, GI Jones  OF pool is a bit better. But the Pirates are going to be targeting a back up type because of Polanco's potential."

So they knew he was leaving, and all kind of gathered around his locker, and no one said anything. Tabata remained quiet the whole time.   Important side note, Mark Melancon bought these little motorized scooters for everyone on the team.   Back to the story. Tabata, who did not say anything, proceeded to get on one of these little scooters and ride off. One of the reporters called out ""Jose?"", like a kid calling out to his hero riding off into the horizon.

Someone is going to have to replace Burnett next year. No way Cueto resigns with the Buccos.  Pedro wouldn't be a huge loss right now, but it will be felt eventually. You can't just suck all the power out of a lineup and expect to win. Josh Bell completely lost his power in AA. If they get rid of Pedro you at least have to have a backup plan in place for 1B.

We really need a lefty besides Jeff ""Box of Chocolates"" (Because you never know what you're gonna get...) Locke. I wouldn't be against the idea of Locke in the bullpen replacing Bastardo or Worley.  I don't know what else honestly. The team isn't in a terrible state, we just need a piece or two to really put us over the top. Hopefully we see some moves made soon(ish) or at least at deadline.  Also, Paul Goldschmidt.

buccos,3bfnvm,DTX180,-17,Mon Jun 29 01:54:54 2015 UTC,Sooo Polanco's pretty much a bust.
buccos,3bfnvm,niggacock6969,8,Sun Jun 28 20:40:44 2015 UTC,Dude's like 23 and hasn't played a full year in the majors yet. pretty ridiculous to call him a bust.
buccos,3bfnvm,rosstimus,-5,Sun Jun 28 20:46:16 2015 UTC,He's been replacement level this year. Which means that basically you could plug in some scrub AAA player and get the same value. Dude was supposed to be one of the best prospects in the game.
buccos,3bfnvm,niggacock6969,3,Sun Jun 28 20:50:35 2015 UTC,"He hasn't performed well this year, but that doesn't necessarily mean he will never adapt to major league pitching. He could end up being a bust, but its too early to make that call imo. I think Hurdle is making the right decision by putting him out there in most games (against righties at least). I'm hoping he will improve with more reps."
buccos,3bfnvm,rosstimus,2,Sun Jun 28 20:55:44 2015 UTC,"Its frustrating how other teams prospects show up and dominate, and our highly touted guy is shit so far.  Dont get me wrong I like polanco as a guy, but he is very average."
buccos,3bfnvm,Samwise777,4,Sun Jun 28 21:20:14 2015 UTC,At least Gerrit Cole turned out alright.
buccos,3bfnvm,drunkenviking,2,Sun Jun 28 22:49:32 2015 UTC,He's a kid with a lot of tools. It takes a bit of time for that to turn into a baseball player. He's in the majors because the tools themselves play so well that they were making AAA look stupid.  He's going to be good.
buccos,3bfnvm,niggacock6969,-4,Sun Jun 28 23:52:35 2015 UTC,"Amen to that. Wish moobs would start hitting like he did last year, too"
buccos,3bfnvm,niggacock6969,-1,Sun Jun 28 23:11:31 2015 UTC,"I guess. It's just that he hasn't shown any improvement whatsoever from last year. It's disappointing. Marte and McCutchen both much better that early in there careers, and he was a better prospect than both of them"
buccos,3bfnvm,ns156,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:50:25 2015 UTC,"On the bright side, he turned down the Pirates' contract offers so we don't have a ton of money sunk into him should he never get better."

buccos,3bf060,montani,0,Sun Jun 28 17:09:34 2015 UTC,I think that rumor was about Marte. I figured this team could use a .300 hitter
buccos,3bf060,drunkenviking,9,Sun Jun 28 17:43:50 2015 UTC,"He was a bad influence on Marte, and they wanted to avoid that with Polanco. So you're both right."
buccos,3bf060,shooler00,4,Sun Jun 28 17:10:46 2015 UTC,"Of of curiosity, are there any details on how he was a bad influence? Or was it just the general poor attitude and lack of hustle."
buccos,3bf060,drunkenviking,6,Sun Jun 28 17:13:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think they made it public. But the guy married, divorced, and then remarried a chick 23 years his senior who stole a baby and told him it was his, has a tattoo of lips on his neck, and may be older than he claims. He has a history of poor decision making. I don't think he has any slack in his leash."
buccos,3bf060,montani,2,Sun Jun 28 20:27:16 2015 UTC,Whatever influences Polanco has had so far haven't really worked in his favor
buccos,3bf060,jeb_the_hick,14,Sun Jun 28 20:35:30 2015 UTC,Polanco doesn't even have 162 games under his belt.
buccos,3bf060,montani,-4,Sun Jun 28 17:16:37 2015 UTC,If the FO thought that would be an issue then why isn't Travis Snider on the team?
buccos,3bf060,fishbulb00,13,Sun Jun 28 17:37:19 2015 UTC,"You're really losing me here.  These are completely different issues.    Tabata got hurt a few years back and never really hustled after he returned from the injury.  He failed to continue to develop and was kinda stuck as a decent BA player with zero power, bad speed and a minus arm.  Then, following his injury, he stopped hustling - he'd let balls drop in front of him, he completely stopped diving and he would dog it on his way to first.  In addition to having on-the-field issues, Tabata also had a series of very strange personal issues including that he married some lady who turned out to be considerably older than he (23 years his senior) and that she kidnapped a child in Florida and told Tabata that the child was theirs.  They had married in 2008, then divorced in 2010 and then remarried in 2011.  So, to say that the FO shouldn't probably trust his decision making might be a bit of an understatement.  Polanco is still a really young player and he is pretty universally regarded as a player who is still going to develop and become a very good contributor.  The Pirates traded away Snider as they saw an opportunity to sell high on a borderline player and replenish the farm system.  It turns out that they were right about Snider too, by the way.  After getting off to a fast start, he has largely faltered since and the Pirates got several nice pitching prospects in return for him."
buccos,3bf060,montani,-6,Sun Jun 28 17:44:59 2015 UTC,"~.300 should negate all of the weird shit. Do you think Gorkys is a better player than Tabata?    Out of Snider, Gorkys, Tabata, a nd Polanco who would you want starting in RF today?  At this point in their careers I'd go with Snider and then Tabata. Polanco may be fucking awesome in two years but he doesn't give the team the best chance to win this year."
buccos,3bf060,fishbulb00,9,Sun Jun 28 17:57:24 2015 UTC,"For the purposes of this conversation, I'm not even going to bother including Hernandez because he's not even close to the same level of the other three.  Polanco absolutely gives the Pirates the best chance to win on any given day.  Polanco is the best defender of the three and he's really still learning the position.  He's fast, he's got a good arm and he's the only one of the three who have ever impressed me with a defensive play.  He's the only one of the three who can steal bases, which is pretty integral to the Pirates' offensive scheme.    Still don't believe me?  Let's do an individual comparison: Polanco is a better defender than Snider.  He can steal bases and Snider cannot.  Snider hits for power though, right?  Polanco actually has more HRs on the season than Snider.  So, not only is Polanco considerably more valuable in the outfield and on the base paths but he is hitting better for power as well."
buccos,3bf060,dekksh,0,Sun Jun 28 18:01:43 2015 UTC,"Gorky is probably the best defender of the lot, just cant hit at any level."
buccos,3bf060,9000miles,0,Sun Jun 28 18:40:49 2015 UTC,"Defense and speed are nice, but do they make up for a 50 point deficit in batting average? Tabata is currently hitting more than 50 points better than Polanco (small sample size, of course), while Snider is hitting more than 30 points better than Polanco.   Bringing up the power issue doesn't help your argument, considering that Polanco has a paltry 3 HR in 276 plate appearances. Snider has 2 in 186 PAs, so their HR rates are identical. Snider's OBP and OPS are far superior to Polanco on the season. Snider is at 1.4 WAR, Polanco at 0.3.  I think we all want to believe that Polanco is a better option than Tabata or Snider, and he certainly will be someday, but right now that does not appear to be the case."
buccos,3bf060,promoreader2,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:57:27 2015 UTC,The hat was deff Tabata's. Saw it in Spring Training
buccos,3bf060,Munkie91087,7,Sun Jun 28 22:57:45 2015 UTC,"He may hit .289 but it's an empty .289. All singles, no extra base hits. Dude hasn't homered since 2013! The lack of homers wouldn't be a big deal if he had any gap power. Dude is basically a singles hitter that hits only ground balls.   He puts the ball on the ground 68 percent of the time and hits line drives only 19 percent of the time. That might not seem like a big deal, but if you're putting the ball on the ground that much you're basically a singles hitter. Which doesn't benefit the team all that much. Not to mention his lack of speed and minus defense. Not something overly valuable as a bench bat."
buccos,3bf060,montani,0,Mon Jun 29 16:44:15 2015 UTC,What does Corey Hart give you?
buccos,3bf060,drunkenjagoff,3,Mon Jun 29 00:45:41 2015 UTC,"A little pop in his bat.  Depth at a position of need.  Probably a better teammate then tabata.  I'm pretty much with you though, ready to move on from Hart.  They may just be waiting for lambo to get healthy."
buccos,3bf060,tonytroz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:28:38 2015 UTC,Plus he is likely a good veteran presence in the clubhouse compared to Tabata's rumors of being a bad influence on the younger guys.
buccos,3bf060,darmike,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:46:47 2015 UTC,"Hart was supposed to bring power, which is one of the big things lacking from the offense this year and something Tabata doesn't have. Hopefully Hart will end up getting replaced before the pennant run as well. They both are pretty useless."
buccos,3bf060,AaadamPgh,2,Mon Jun 29 13:30:47 2015 UTC,Tabata is hands down the pirates biggest waste of money in a number of years. I've heard as most of you mentioned he is a douche in the locker room. Seems like when they pan on the dug out he's always by himself. That should tell you something there lol
buccos,3bf060,Baseball_dusty,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:55:25 2015 UTC,"They're just daring some other team to take his contract. Tabata has been an okay pinch hitter, but is very overpaid for his role."

buccos,3bdrrv,patstuart2,4,Sun Jun 28 13:50:07 2015 UTC,"Gambler's fallacy:       The gambler's fallacy, also known as the Monte Carlo fallacy or the fallacy of the maturity of chances, is the mistaken belief that, if something happens more frequently than normal during some period, it will happen less frequently in the future, or that, if something happens less frequently than normal during some period, it will happen more frequently in the future (presumably as a means of balancing nature). In situations where what is being observed is truly random (i.e., independent trials of a random process), this belief, though appealing to the human mind, is false. This fallacy can arise in many practical situations although it is most strongly associated with gambling where such mistakes are common among players.

buccos,3bdrrv,autowikibot,4,Sun Jun 28 13:51:06 2015 UTC,"Gambler's Fallacy only applies to random events though, like a roulette wheels, or rolling dice in craps. There are external factors influencing whether or not the Cardinals will continue to win."
buccos,3bdrrv,jesus_fn_christ,9,Sun Jun 28 17:36:53 2015 UTC,"Not quite. Those factors might tilt the chances further in one direction or another, but the gambler's fallacy applies to any phenomenon with randomness built into it.  Example: the last two weeks were extremely rainy. But that doesn't mean it will be drier (or wetter) than usual next week to make up for it - even though this time of year brings a higher likelihood of tropical storms."
buccos,3bdrrv,patstuart2,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:23:57 2015 UTC,"The theory may apply in some capacity to a situation like weather or teams winning percentage, but certainly not nearly like it does in truly random scenarios, especially in the short term.   Like J-fn-C said, external factors have to be taken into consideration.    Example: Weather is not a random output with no relation to the previous days/weeks input (although in the midwest sometimes it feels this way).  For example, if May 3rd is 90 degrees and humid, May 4th has a MUCH lower chance of being sub-freezing and dry as compared to the ""historical daily average"" for May 4th in that area.  Obviously, the further into the future from May 3rd (recorded temperature) you look, the less that future day will be affected by the weather on May 3rd and eventually the effect will be 0, reverting back to the random ""historical averages"".  At this point, the full extent of Gambler's Fallacy applies.  However, this does not take into account macroscale weather phenomenoms that have a compounding affect on future weather outcomes.  For example, severe drought greatly diminishes the amount of water evaporating in a particular area and thus the level of humidity/chance of rain.  These patterns can subsist for year-long periods (see southern Texas for the 5-10 years before this year) and become self-sustaining.  The same goes for player and team performances.  How a player/team performs one day (daily weather) DOES indeed affect their performance the following day.  This too can lead to macroscale phenomenon (in sports we call them streaks or slumps).  Steaks most certainly can span an entire season (see Luis Gonzalez's season in 2001) and the mental aspect of success can not be discounted. Thus, although gambler's fallacy may still apply, in non-random situations like weather or sports, it is most certainly blunted.   TL;DR. Things such as baseball and weather are non-random, particularly in the short term.  Thus theories requiring random events (gambler's fallacy) are less applicable. All that said, I see the Cardinals winning 104 games this year...but in a cruel twist of fate losing to the Dodgers in the playoffs with Kershaw winning 2 of the games."
buccos,3bdrrv,nbsixer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:02:21 2015 UTC,"Upvote for your intellectual response.  I'll read that right before I go to Rivers Casino ""for the buffet"".  As a psychologist, I would add that when measuring human performance (unlike slot machines) the assessed outcome is not entirely determined by the programmed performance of the players.    In baseball, there are many sources of error that could go on a run....all tilting in favor of the Cardinals.  Just a few examples might include getting calls from the umps, weather, and lucky bounces.  These variables should tend to normalize over time, pulling the Cardinals W-L record closer to their true level of proficiency...which I believe is far less than their record would indicate, yet greater than I believe the Pirates' to be."

If you're going to attend a Pirates game (or any level of organized, professional baseball game--or any sporting event, really), and there's rain in the forecast, you should absolutely bring an umbrella.  If the game (or event, as it were) enters a rain delay, far be it from me to stop you from opening it in the seating area.  But don't be a jagoff and open it during the game, please. And especially don't do it twice in as many innings. (because somebody did that in my section today)"

buccos,3bcqk0,seege12,7,Sun Jun 28 00:03:33 2015 UTC,Pedro has a lot more base running ability and awareness than people give him credit for. One of the few things I'd trust Pedro with is not running into a Tootblan

buccos,3bcqk0,Dleeu2,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:13:53 2015 UTC,"Issue is that because most of the time he can't, he's not adding any base running value. Still obviously nice knowing he's not going to make any dumb decisions, but you only get value out of it by the player actually taking extra bases."

buccos,3barpy,biggato,2,Sat Jun 27 12:27:51 2015 UTC,It's taxi or bus (28X) to downtown. Though you could take one of those airport shuttles to a downtown hotel too  http://www.portauthority.org/paac/SchedulesMaps/TripPlanner.aspx?mode=mini&from=Airport Pittsburgh International&to=Downtown Service Center&date=6/27/2015&time=6/27/2015 8:36:00 AM&aord=D
buccos,3barpy,lurkymclurkyson,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:41:00 2015 UTC,Thank you. Do you know if a taxi to the airport is a flat rate fee or should I try uber instead?
buccos,3barpy,lurkymclurkyson,2,Sat Jun 27 13:14:07 2015 UTC,"It should still be a flat rate.  Just go downtown, it's an easy walk from there across the Clemente bridge"
buccos,3barpy,judehaz,2,Sat Jun 27 14:05:36 2015 UTC,Taxi is going to be around $40 with tip. The bus is only $2.50. Google Maps has the PAT schedule.
buccos,3barpy,woodchuck10,2,Sat Jun 27 15:11:14 2015 UTC,Super shuttle I want to say is about $20 from the airport to the park. Could be wrong but they typically a flat rate
buccos,3barpy,g23john,2,Sat Jun 27 14:21:27 2015 UTC,"28x is like $3.50 and will get you downtown. It takes about 45 minutes though. It is the best way to get to and fro the airport, IMO."

buccos,3b7y5e,drewp3,3,Fri Jun 26 22:02:48 2015 UTC,Tulo has durability issues. Health is a serious question mark.
buccos,3b7y5e,burningheavy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:40:41 2015 UTC,"Valid, but I don't think it's a big enough of a question mark. He'd make the team better by miles when healthy and if God loves us he will usually be healthy. He will be under contract well past when those prospects will even attempt to make a difference at the big league level and remember, 9/10 prospects fail (I'm using a number quoted by a gm. Do some hard research and it's about that. Think about it. 50 rounds of a draft, if not more, and only 30 teams of 25... numbers don't add up). The pirates system is SOO deep that they can trade 5 top 100 prospects and have 3 still in the system NOT counting the fact that the pirates have recently gotten nobodies to devolope into somebodies (glasnow, kingham). The injury problem should get him to be had cheaper. Those prospects and Colorodo eats the contract. Pirates would rather the contract? Pirates eat the contracts and only give up Taillon (make him available already, he's going to end up a closer if we are lucky) and polanco (not sold on him at all but he's young with mlb experience. Should have value). Tulo makes sense. There are plenty of other players that makes sense but a SS with good defense that can hit and is under contract for the next 7 seasons... How the heck do you not go for that?"
buccos,3b7y5e,drewp3,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:01:00 2015 UTC,Looks like mercer's bat is coming around again though. You wouldn't have any questions about SS if mercer didn't start slow again cause the dude is solid in the field.
buccos,3b7y5e,burningheavy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:19:58 2015 UTC,You think mercer is better than tulo...

buccos,3b7y5e,ImBowser,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:04:55 2015 UTC,Which is fucking absurd
buccos,3b7y5e,burningheavy,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:00:24 2015 UTC,"Not just this sub but the Pittsburgh baseball community... It's like they don't realize 9/10 promising pitching prospects will end up duds and trading them for proven veterans is the single smartest thing you can do, unless it's a rental.... this article proves that point rather well.  http://www.mlbdailydish.com/2015/6/29/8860979/trade-deadline-prospects-jose-tabata-pirates  The ONLY prospect I've been hyped about is Gerrit Cole because he was dominant against excellent COLLEGE hitters and his skill AND stats were there. Less than a year and a half later he was a decent MLB pitcher and 2 years later he is an ACE. Any HS guy that ""looks"" like a stud will likely be a dud."
buccos,3b7y5e,vecnyj,0,Tue Jun 30 06:25:40 2015 UTC,"A Tulo trade would take a lot more than Josh Bell, probably Polanco."
buccos,3b7y5e,burningheavy,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:22:40 2015 UTC,"Oh, I never dreamed of a 1 for one. Bell (who's blocked. He's in the OF right? If he's 1b I wouldn't include him) Polanco (I've seen way to many mistakes from him to have a lot of faith in him. Base running blunders, sub par defense, swinging at balls in the dirt. He has potential but IDK if he will reach it. I USED to say that about marte based purely on stats and then I watched him play... BOY was I wrong. Gotta watch people play) Taillon (i've never seen him as more than an over hyped closer, crucify me, I'm ready) Glasnow (I'd take a proven SS that can hit and is signed  for 7 years over a guy that hasn't pitched above A ball and is in his early 20's) and Hanson (blocked, unless walker goes elsewhere).  Tl;Dr Polonco (Give Jaff Decker love, I'm not sold on polanco. Decker is just as young and playing well in AAA), Bell, Hanson, Glasnow and Taillon. Still have a stud pitcher in Kingham, still have a stud outfielder in Meadows (Decker can be a stop gap and if he doesn't play well not that screwed. POlanco is NOT playing well right now) and you are trading for a long future in the middle infield (where we've drafted a million recently). WE are giving excellent prospects (most of which are in the low minors where we ALL no shit can go wrong) without gutting our farm system (which people forget is replenished every season and we will have 7 seasons to replenish it before the player we traded for is gone..... Not asking for that package for a rental) I think it's a win win, but I""m talking to pirates fans who think unproven prospects are Gods...."
buccos,3b7y5e,vecnyj,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:52:40 2015 UTC,"Bell has moved to 1B this season, so he could get a chance soon if we trade Pedro.  Glasnow is in AA this year, and is still only 21.   That's probably what a package to get Tulo would look like, though.  Decker may be the same age as Polanco, but his ceiling is way way lower. If we do trade Polanco I'd rather see J-Hay in RF and Kang starting at 3B."
buccos,3b7y5e,burningheavy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:58:25 2015 UTC,You think that's all it'd take to get tulo? Who wouldn't take that.  Two promising prospects that might flop for 7 years of a guarantee vet at a prime position? Colorado would be fools to take that even if pittsburgh ate all of the contract

buccos,3b739k,cymmot,3,Sat Jun 27 00:38:33 2015 UTC,Balks are super confusing to me.
buccos,3b739k,call-tur,4,Sat Jun 27 00:41:50 2015 UTC,"which part?  The general premise is that only specific movements are permitted, and any deviations from those movements are deceiving to the runners, i.e. balks.    If you're in stretch, you either step off, go to set (in one uninterrupted motion), or throw (to an occupied base only).  Any deviation from those, or stepping off improperly, or dropping the ball, or starting to come set and stopping (which he did) is a balk.  When the runner sees you start a movement, he knows he has until you stop before you can do another movement (like throw).    If you're in set, you either step off, throw home, or throw to an occupied base.  Once you're set, if you move at all you're committed to do something... lefties have an advantage here with a runner on first because their ""pitch"" motion is exactly the same as their ""throw to first"" motion for a half a second.    Once you commit to an action, you're committed to that action until complete.  Stopping and starting is how most balks happen.  Then there are the technical ones like no straddling the rubber with your hands together (hands together = set), no touching the rubber without the ball (deceptive), disengaging the rubber has to be done properly (backwards - clear that you're disengaging, not throwing to a base)."

Actually I am going to go on a mini-vent.  I am allowed to, I stayed up until freaking 12:45 watching this bullshit when I have to be at work in 6 and 1/2 hours.  I hate when Hurdle plays small ball.  For example, last night they are down 4-0 and Harrison bunts a runner to 3rd with out.  Yet tonight when its an obvious bunt situation he doesn't, or another example last week Marte is up vs scrubby John Danks and he moves a runner to 3rd via bunt.  It really limits the opportunity to have a big inning by ""giving up"" an out.  Again obviously no one says anything if that ball is shot into right field and cutch scores but that isn't how it went down.    Maybe someone can educate me on this?   % chance a run scores with no outs from 2nd base  % chance a run scores from 3rd base with 1 out?   Maybe the % aren't that far off and swinging away wasn't a bad % play?  I dont know I am just frustrated.  I have been into the sauce a bit too, time to sleep this one off"
buccos,3b5qb5,unshifted,3,Fri Jun 26 05:05:58 2015 UTC,"You're expected to score more runs with a runner on second with no outs than you are with a runner on third with one out (1.0631 runs vs. .899 runs), however, you're more likely to score at least one run with a runner on third with one out (67.4% vs. 63.7%).

buccos,3b2p5f,puckhead66,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:15:59 2015 UTC,"I think a WS run has to start with us doing our best to take the Central. While the wild Card game is as intense a baseball game gets outside of Game 7 of the World Series, we've been there 2 years back to back and although the Giants won it all as wilcard last season, it's insanely hard to make it as a Wild Card let alone win the wild card game against another top tier team with their ace on the mound. I like our odds in a 5 and 7 game series but a one game playoff is anyone's game."

buccos,3b2op3,rolobrowntowntony,2,Thu Jun 25 15:31:24 2015 UTC,I'm looking how to use google adwords. so its quite dramatic because I'm so confused.
buccos,3b2op3,rolobrowntowntony,2,Thu Jun 25 16:03:43 2015 UTC,That's a small part of what I do (usually I direct its use instead of doing it myself). What has you confused?
buccos,3b2op3,rolobrowntowntony,2,Thu Jun 25 16:25:35 2015 UTC,"just the whole process of bidding and stuff. it makes sense to a degree. like i get it that you need to have relevant keywords, relevant content, etc to have a better ad score so it ends up bumping you up to the higher spots.   Like my company is going to be releasing an app soon. we have a small landing page to gain some attention and have an email signup for more info when it will be released.   So i got some ad groups together with the search terms that i think would be relevant. I just want to make sure i won't be blowing money if I'm bidding to high etc.   its just a very complex interface with a lot of nerd nobs that I'm not fully understanding yet."
buccos,3b2op3,plorange,2,Thu Jun 25 16:42:41 2015 UTC,"A lot of the interaction between AdWords, Google search, and your landing page is rooted in balance. You want the keywords you buy to be relevant to what you're selling, obviously; but it has to be a word or phrase that people are actually searching for. And you want those keyphrases to actually be in the text of the page; but they need to be placed in the copy (instead of stuffing them down at the bottom of the page). Additionally (and perhaps most important) is the quality score of the landing page. This is where all that other stuff comes together. Basically, Google looks at some combination of these things (they're fairly secretive about how they're weighted):   Relevance to the keywords entered (The first headline and first paragraph of the page, do they contain your keyword(s)?) Page load speed (if the page is responsive and displays well on mobile devices, Google gives you some extra love) Transparency (is your contact information easy to find, are you clear about what you expect of the user, etc) Does every image on the page use an alt tag so that search spiders and screenreaders can convey the content of the image?   That hits the high points"
buccos,3b2op3,Doublehalfpint,2,Thu Jun 25 18:41:12 2015 UTC,good God what have i gotten myself into. but that is good to know about the keywords should be in the copy of the page itself not shoved in the bottom. you're awesome kill.
buccos,3b2op3,OhwhatupCarlandJonny,2,Thu Jun 25 19:06:20 2015 UTC,"Ah, you do it enough and it becomes second nature. You'll do fine."
buccos,3b2op3,jesuschrysler,2,Thu Jun 25 19:08:16 2015 UTC,"Also, here's a fun fact:  Back in the bad old days when search engines were new and there wasn't even really such a thing as PPC, people would stick a whole shitload of keywords down in the body of the page and set their color to match the background color of the page itself. This was the beginning of keyword stuffing.  Eventually search engines got smart enough to not only block that stuff out, but if you're caught doing it nowadays, Google will blacklist your site so that it doesn't matter how much you pay for your keywords, you won't show up on any search results."

buccos,3b2op3,AaadamPgh,3,Fri Jun 26 03:29:35 2015 UTC,"Pelican's really great. If you like instrumental post metal like that, check out Russian Circles. Here's their first album, Enter in its entirety.   Perhaps also of interest is Mono, a Japanese instrumental outfit, although a bit softer and more atmospheric than Pelican or Russian Circles. Here's their album You Are There, again in its entirety."
buccos,3b2op3,The_Notorious_HAM,3,Thu Jun 25 16:06:41 2015 UTC,shweet! I'm digging the russian circles album at the moment.
buccos,3b2op3,rolobrowntowntony,3,Thu Jun 25 16:24:48 2015 UTC,"They're so good. Russian Circles and Pelican kind of run in the same Chicago scene.  For harder stuff, you might be interested in Isis. Also instrumental post metal, and also Chicago-based.   Celestial (full album) Oceanic (full album) Panopticon (full album)   You might also like Red Sparowes (which is LA-based, but includes members of Isis and other bands). These guys also have hilariously long song titles.   At the Soundless Dawn (full album) Every Red Heart Shines Toward The Red Sun (full album) The Fear Is Excruciating, But Therein Lies the Answer (full album)"
buccos,3b2op3,AaadamPgh,2,Thu Jun 25 16:44:22 2015 UTC,man it brings me back to my high school days. there was a band that used to play in the basement of a library who sounded a lot like russian circles and isis (from the little bit i skimmed through). that must be why i like it so much. ah youth. unfortunate name for isis though haha
buccos,3b2op3,Dleeu2,2,Thu Jun 25 18:10:31 2015 UTC,"Even though the band's been inactive for a long time, they still had to go and change the name of their facebook page to clarify that they're a band because they were getting so much hatemail. lol"

buccos,3b2op3,Dleeu2,3,Thu Jun 25 18:24:54 2015 UTC,"We're scouting the Red Sox. The speculation is that we are interested in Clay Buchholz. Decent groundball rate, $13 mil option for next year and $13.5 mil option for 17. Although, he is inconsistent."
buccos,3b2op3,jmb_412,3,Fri Jun 26 03:01:42 2015 UTC,What do you think the cost would be?
buccos,3b2op3,The_Notorious_HAM,3,Thu Jun 25 17:51:10 2015 UTC,"I think the Red Sox would want pitching. They will tell us that Buchholz is pitching like a #1 or #2 starter right now and has 2 more relatively cheap years under control. We will tell them that he is inconsistent, which is a serious downside.  I would try something like Adrian Sampson, Cody Dickson/Jeff Locke, and maybe Wyatt Mathisen. I don't think anyone in our top 10 is worth Buchholz."
buccos,3b2op3,IamNotYourBuddy,3,Thu Jun 25 18:05:28 2015 UTC,i wouldn't totally be against it... with our pitching staff I'm sure we could get him to be consistent. but like you're saying.. it has to be for the right price
buccos,3b2op3,The_Notorious_HAM,2,Thu Jun 25 18:09:21 2015 UTC,"That wouldn't be too bad. If they think they can fix his inconsistency, that would upgrade the rotation & he would essentially replace Burnett after this year."

buccos,3b3450,Gameroomvids,3,Fri Jun 26 04:34:51 2015 UTC,"None of these sound like great ideas. If you block Polanco you might as well trade him because he needs playing time to have any chance of breaking out. Trading J-Hay plus prospect(s) for more power isn't going to matter much if over a third of your lineup like Walker, Polanco, and Alvarez can't get on base.  This team is in the playoff hunt with a huge influx of potential prospects in the next two years. If they're going to mortgage that future at all it needs to upgrade one of those big holes, but all three of those guys still have potential to have strong second halves."

buccos,3aydhh,tonytroz,2,Wed Jun 24 23:12:20 2015 UTC,"While that all remains true, the score was more to the point. A multi-run top of the first isn't generally the best way to start a game.

buccos,3aydhh,AMcMahon1,2,Wed Jun 24 23:16:23 2015 UTC,I don't have the stats on-hand but Cole seems to struggle a lot in the 1st inning. Even in some of his dominant games he's had to pitch out of some jams early. I know this one was weird with two outs but it seems like he's vulnerable.

buccos,3aydhh,Kodyak77,2,Wed Jun 24 23:19:47 2015 UTC,Can't wait until we get rid of the homeplate umpire calling balls and strikes. This game is a prime example of how bad they can fuck the game up purely on calling balls and strikes
buccos,3aydhh,tonytroz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:26:38 2015 UTC,I'm wondering how they're gonna make this happen though.   You still need a homeplate umpire for any safe/out call at home.   But what about giving him an earpiece that relays the correct strike/ball call from the automated K-zone?  This would also eliminate players and managers arguing balls and strikes.

buccos,3awp9e,AMcMahon1,7,Wed Jun 24 02:50:46 2015 UTC,"Nope, he didn't go 5 innings, so it's up to the scorer to choose the most effective reliever.  Somehow that was Scahill, who gave up 2H 1BB 1ER in 0.2 IP.  Personally I would have gone with Caminero or Watson."
buccos,3awp9e,vecnyj,3,Wed Jun 24 03:00:27 2015 UTC,shhh... you're killing the vibe
buccos,3awp9e,AMcMahon1,3,Wed Jun 24 03:04:21 2015 UTC,The scorer probably looked at all the pitchers and just picked one at random.
buccos,3awp9e,IamNotYourBuddy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:52:03 2015 UTC,The game was already 7-4 going into that 5th inning so I think it made sense to choose between Scahill and Hughes rather than the guys that came after. Hughes only pitched a single out so I can understand the decision.
buccos,3awp9e,tonytroz,0,Wed Jun 24 15:31:47 2015 UTC,"No, they're supposed choose the relief pitcher who was ""most effective"". That was clearly not Scahill."
buccos,3awp9e,vecnyj,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:37:02 2015 UTC,The rule wouldn't be that vague if it wasn't supposed to be interpreted.
buccos,3awp9e,tonytroz,2,Wed Jun 24 15:39:35 2015 UTC,"Maybe there's some sort of unwritten rule to just give the W to the pitcher from the next inning, but I'm unaware of it."

I think someone complained because anytime we have a meeting in his office, he starts making coffee for himself or starts microwaving his food.

Some were legit concerns and others were silly. Eventually she got to play, which was great because she was a good player, but every time she did something good it was because the other team felt uncomfortable tackling her or they let her get away with it, every time she made a mistake it was because she was a girl.   Eventually a group of girls started playing football on the weekends, it wasn't considered a school sport but whatever, and all the drama dissolved and everyone was much happier.   I have to admit that id be uncomfortable playing a female dominated sport with one male, so I'd understand if other players and coaches would get upset.   I'm sure the resources exist to form a women's league, why not get the ball rolling?

buccos,3amx6c,ArmedSnobbery,11,Sun Jun 21 22:07:40 2015 UTC,"No, actually, I wouldn't have. Like you said, it's baseball, and Tabata is a baseball player, trying to get on base, no matter what.  Even Scherzer said he let the pitch get away and he would have done the same thing Tabata did.  He doesn't play for the Nationals. He plays for the Pirates and we haven't had a perfect game against us in our 129 year history. He was protecting the logo and being a baseball player. He saw an opportunity to get on base, and he took it.  Nice sweep, by the way."
buccos,3amx6c,CityOfChamps09,7,Sun Jun 21 23:50:04 2015 UTC,There was an identical play in the Florida CWS game and he was called out.    It wasn't identical.  The pitch wasn't a strike.  You can't call someone out on a ball.
buccos,3amx6c,m1stertim,6,Sun Jun 21 23:56:55 2015 UTC,"The best the ump could've done was called it a ball, since it was outside of the strike zone. It would've been a 3-2 count; even if the ump ruled that Tabata hadn't gotten out of the way, it was far from a sure thing that Scherzer would've gotten a perfect game."
buccos,3amx6c,skiman71,6,Mon Jun 22 00:42:15 2015 UTC,"Considering that 1) opposing batters have a .412 OBP against Scherzer on 3-2 counts this year 2) Scherzer was visibly nervous/tired, and even admitted so after the game, and 3) Tabata has been hitting well lately, I would say the odds of Tabata getting on base would've been pretty high. I'm not saying he definitely would have, but he might have so it's naive to assume that he would've gotten out had the umpire called it a ball"
buccos,3amx6c,skiman71,4,Mon Jun 22 00:59:47 2015 UTC,"Had the umpire expanded the strike  zone then the perfect game would've been meaningless because Scherzer wouldn't have truly earned it.  Now I'm not trying to take anything away from Scherzer, he's an awesome pitcher and he was insane yesterday. It really was a shame that his perfect game ended the way that it did. But all in all, Tabata was put in to pinch hit, and his job was to get on base. Had the Pirates wanted to hand Scherzer the perfect game they would've just sent Worley out there to bat. I know you guys say the game was out of reach, but crazier things have happened before. If you'd like, look up Brian Giles walk off grand slam, which helped the Pirates come back, down 6, with 2 outs and 2 strikes in the ninth"
buccos,3amx6c,skiman71,9,Mon Jun 22 01:32:10 2015 UTC,"Dude, just drop it. It was a baseball play. They very rarely call an out there in MLB for not getting out of the way.  One of the columnists in Pittsburgh likened it to the Strahan sack record and Favre just laying down. Tabata wasn't going to stand there; he saw an opportunity and he took it.  Sherzer didn't earn a perfect game; he earned 8 innings, 2 outs and 2 strikes of a perfect game, but you have to finish.   He didn't finish. End of story. A no-no is still a no-no though. Take it and be happy with that."
buccos,3amx6c,CityOfChamps09,10,Mon Jun 22 01:33:56 2015 UTC,"The rules state a lot of things that sometimes aren't enforced.  Let. It. Go. You aren't going to win this argument when any rational fan can and will see Tabata's side of the story. Go back to your subreddit and take your no-no and sweep with you, shut the fuck up, and sit down."
buccos,3amx6c,CityOfChamps09,10,Mon Jun 22 01:41:37 2015 UTC,"On the bright side, for the Pirates, they held the Nationals scoreless through 8.1 innings."

buccos,3amx6c,pylon567,5,Mon Jun 22 00:09:16 2015 UTC,"One bad game does not a season make, my friend. Morton's been pretty good this year. He just didn't have it today.  Before today, he was 5-0 with a 1.62 ERA. How can you not trust that?"
buccos,3amx6c,CityOfChamps09,3,Sun Jun 21 20:15:38 2015 UTC,"Morton isnt horrible, but the law of averages hit him like a truck. No way he was going to float around an ERA of 2 for very long. He's a mid 3 ERA guy at best"
buccos,3amx6c,IamNotYourBuddy,2,Sun Jun 21 20:30:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying I can't trust that, but since we got Charlie from the Braves, he's always been up and down. It was only a matter of time until he had a start like this and could possibly snowball.   I know he's been pitching well, but it seems like everyone has forgotten Charlie's ability to do himself in with overthinking."
buccos,3amx6c,pylon567,5,Sun Jun 21 22:25:14 2015 UTC,"To be fair, most teams don't have sure-fire aces as their #4 guy in the rotation."
buccos,3amx6c,ns156,2,Sun Jun 21 23:56:15 2015 UTC,"This. It just doesn't happen, especially for small market teams. Charlie is a #4 guy who most years was thrown throw into a higher role because of injuries or depth. His 5-0 start raised the bar even higher than it should have been."
buccos,3amx6c,tonytroz,2,Sun Jun 21 23:11:47 2015 UTC,"but I will never trust Morton.   It's doubtful the Pirates will ever have a 4th starter that you can trust to win the majority of his games. That's just not how baseball works. Charlie's problem is he usually gets thrusted into a role where he needs to be trusted, and this year he finally had expectations set right and his 5-0 start raised the bar even higher than usual.  He'll probably win 10+ games this year but get blown up a few times. That's a beyond expectations for most teams' 4th guy."
buccos,3amx6c,tonytroz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:50:56 2015 UTC,I was at the game... a guy (50-60 year old) was screaming for Gio to hit Tabata in the head. I thought he was kidding.. I was wrong.   I go to many pirates vs nats games in DC. I can promise you that nats fans (and caps fans) are classless.   Fuck the nationals.
buccos,3amx6c,talktomylawya,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:44:08 2015 UTC,"I was there too, 310, and more than a few were yelling for him to be beaned in the skull.  Normally I have no problem with Nats fans, Caps fans are a different matter but I understand that, we've knocked them out of the playoffs like 7 out of 8 times, I'd hate us too!  Also, some Nats asshole old fuck behind me yelled at my son because he was blocking his view.  Some shit like, ""WOULD YOU SIT DOWN AND GET OUT OF THE DAMN WAY, KID?!""  We had front row seats on the third deck and sorry, Nats fans, but that stadium sucks for watching baseball because the stupid railing is, for one, too low, and two you can't see shit if you're front row and a kid because there's this thick steel bar right at eye level.  Also, they have glass which means it gets shitty glares and water on it.  My son just turned seven and no, it's not at all cool to yell at him.  I was pissed as fuck, told the old asshole if he has anything to say about my kid then say it to ME, his dad, yelling at a seven-year-old is rude as hell and he's lucky he's too old for me to really be upset.  He tried saying he didn't think he was wrong and I told him he's full of it, he was wrong, you don't talk to someone else's kid like that and he was way out of line, not to mention it was the damn seven inning and they were up 9-0, go home and get some rest ya old bastard.  Best part was my five-year-old daughter said, ""Mommy, that old man just yelled at (my son's name).  My son sat back in his chair and couldn't see shit so I told him to switch places with me so he could sit on his feet and see.  I'm only 5'10"" but 290 lbs, a powerlifter, dude behind me kept huffing and puffing so I turned around and asked him if his view was better now then laughed.  The Nats fans next to us apologized for the old bastard and we shared some peanuts.  Sorry for the novel here, just had to get it off my chest.  After an inning my son forgot about the stranger yelling at him and had fun even though we were losing.  Also, after the game he got to run the bases so it was a good day overall.  Still, I'll think twice about going to a Nats game, just don't like the stupid glass and I always love getting front row seats, I'll stick to Camden I guess."

When I think of lineup, I think of everyday players and even semi-everyday players, such as Stewart, not pinch hitters. Tabata and Hart are pinch hitters. They may get an occasional start maybe 3 times a month, but that's it. They really aren't glaring holes in a lineup unless they start."

Granted, that team lost 105 games, but still. Take out that year, and he's a few games under .500 with about a 4.00 ERA for his career, a perfectly cromulent pitcher.   But today? My God."

buccos,3am7eh,Flexidry_,4,Sun Jun 21 18:09:21 2015 UTC,"Warning: pure speculation ahead, looking for discussion  The Pirates will be 7 games behind after today. The Cardinals are not slowing down and they likely won't. When the trade deadline comes around, the Pirates will make a few small-to-medium sized trades and the Cardinals will make the huge trades.   This means we'll face some team's ace in the Wild Card… maybe Scherzer, make Bumgarner. I like Cole against anyone but I hate our offense against anyone but league average pitchers.   Ugh. This is too overly pessimistic but I wanted to vent."
buccos,3am7eh,FrederickMercury,3,Sun Jun 21 18:09:07 2015 UTC,"It may be the weekend demolition / pessimism talking, but sigh... this seems too spot on, except you forgot to add the part where the Pirates finish with the 2nd or 3rd best record in baseball and still get stuck in that WC game."
buccos,3am7eh,chip42,2,Sun Jun 21 18:09:07 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't anticipate Scherzer being in the wildcard. We're far and away the most talented team in the NL East. I'd anticipate the wildcard pitcher being from either LA/SF, Chicago, or NYM, So only Kershaw/Bumgarner, Lester, or Harvey."

buccos,3am7eh,seppalepp,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:20:14 2015 UTC,I guess they are more apt to FA pickups (I don't follow them closely enough to know who was a trade/who was a FA).  But the point is… their GM will make moves Huntington won't.
buccos,3am7eh,FrederickMercury,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:13:17 2015 UTC,"What moves do we need to make? I don't like the depth of our starters. As we can see today, you can't really trust chuck. I don't think AJs numbers are sustainable and who knows with Jeff Locke. Our offense is really stagnating right now, but I think they'll pick it up as the season goes along. The only other move I'd make is upgrading from Cory Hart. I think the a trade for a 4th or 5th slot SP would be our main focus right now."
buccos,3am7eh,THEcasanova,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:09:55 2015 UTC,There's no way they can make all of the moves they need to make.   I agree with you on a 4th/5th starter. I think we also need another reliever and definitely something better than our current first base situation.
buccos,3am7eh,FrederickMercury,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:13:49 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the first base situation. We would have to give up a lot to get someone better than Pedro/Rodriguez platoon and they may only be a rental. The team doesn't need all that much. We have one of the best bullpens in the MLB with Watson as a very solid set up guy and Melancon is up there in the majors with saves. Between Worley, Hughes, and Caminero I think we are more than Ok there. Really I think a low rotation starter is the only move worth making right now."

The slider was way inside when he was trying to throw it to the opposite side of the plate. Jose Tabata leaned in and took his base, that's just baseball."
buccos,3al32m,wantstosavetheworld,19,Sun Jun 21 14:24:33 2015 UTC,"It's really true though, even Scherzer was talking about that pitch after the game like that. He knew it got away from him as soon as it left his hand, and he couldn't blame Tabata for possibly leaning in on it because even he would do the same thing if he was at the plate for that pitch. I got into a fight with someone in /r/baseball last night with a guy saying Tabata should've just stood there. I argued that Scherzer would've wanted to earn his perfect game and the guy called me an idiot saying he'd already earned it. I truly don't think you've earned a perfect game until the last strike. Scherzer earned 8 and a third and two strikes of a perfect game, but that ball got away from him and he didn't earn a perfect game. That's all there is to it"

It's one thing to say that a player should never take a pitch to the elbow. At least that's consistent. But saying that it's okay every time but a situation like this? That's just absurd. It's literally saying that players should take a play off.  I vividly remember Strahan's ""sack"" on Favre. It was embarrassing. If you really want to respect the game, you don't give someone an easy record just to say he got it."

You have to be perfect to get a perfect game. That is why there has only been 23 of them. It's not Tabata's job to help. If Scherzer wanted the perfect game he should have stuck him out, and no one knows that more than Scherzer himself. Congrats he and his team on the no hitter though."

buccos,3ajvm5,ramblin_gamblin,3,Sat Jun 20 23:06:11 2015 UTC,"You'll get two sides of the coins....  people who say a player should do anything and everything they can to get on base... regardless of the circumstances.    You'll get the people who say 'eh, two outs, one pitch away.... take the damn strike and give the pitcher his perfect game' because they are so rare.    Most of the Pirates fans will defend their player (as is their right) but just as many (like myself) will be sad the prefect game didn't happen.  It really isn't going to be one and only one opinion."

HOWEVER - I tend to think that when you're the last guy up at the end of a no-hitter or a perfect game, you need to pull out every trick you can.  Legal or otherwise.  Don't let your team be the victim of a perfecto.  Step out of the box.  Wear out the pitcher with a long at-bat.  Drag bunt if you can.  Or, in this case, get clipped when the pitcher is sloppy.  Good on Tabata.  Smart play, IMO."

buccos,3ajvm5,IONTOP,3,Sat Jun 20 23:00:55 2015 UTC,"That's fair enough.  I would admire a player who refused to go that route, but I also respect someone who is hellbent on not going into the history books.  If a player we don't even know yet one day comes up to bat in game 162 with the score out of reach, looking for the home run title... I wouldn't fault the pitcher for intentionally walking him and denying him the chance.  Don't be a statistic.  That's just how I look at it."

A pinch batter comes into the bottom of the 9th inning against a pitcher who has dominated his team the entire game. You're down 6-0, and he is 1 strike away from a perfect game.

Yeah, he's good right now.  Really good.  Really, really good.  No way this will last.  What happens first, another injury or another streak of 3 IP and 4+ earned runs allowed?  The odds, at his age, that he's finally gotten it all together are astronomical.  If he didn't get hurt every year he'd be damned good trade bait."
buccos,3afk76,ericfg,8,Sat Jun 20 02:29:43 2015 UTC,"The odds, at his age, that he's finally gotten it all together are astronomical.   Roy Halladay was a very similar style pitcher and his best years were in his early 30s. It's not that far fetched for a gimmicky pitcher to mature and do better relying on his experience instead of his youth.  That being said, no, he won't sustain pitching like an ace, but he's a #4 and he can absolutely pitch like he did in 2013 again which was a strong #3 quality. We don't need him to win 20 games for him to contribute."
buccos,3afk76,tonytroz,3,Sat Jun 20 03:38:11 2015 UTC,"I'm a tad skeptical. It wasn't that many years ago when Overbay was saying how Morton's stuff was as good or better than Halladay's and then he got hurt and fell back. It'd be nice to see him sustain it, but I'm being carefully optimistic. He's just got to stay healthy."

buccos,3ae7nf,Kodyak77,9,Fri Jun 19 12:01:51 2015 UTC,"I was hoping someone would post something discussing all-stars :)  Honestly I think McCutchen and Cole are locks. Cole may start, but it's Bruce Bochy so who knows. Either way they are too good and popular to miss out.   Next is what I call the ""cusp"" tier. These guys could make it but are lost in the mix of other guys who could make it. Usually they lack something or have some weakness that stops them from being automatic. This year includes:  Marte: Very good player having a breakout type season, at least it looks that way. Problem is he is either hot or ice cold, and as a result he doesn't have those undeniable numbers that makes you a lock. And I don't know how much Bochy will consider this but he does loaf around and take plays off, which works against him.  Burnett: Great numbers although the wins aren't there (and like it or not they matter for the All-Star game) and a lot of teams have good starters. He deserves to make it but there is just something that doesn't scream lock.  Melancon: The saves are nice but the ERA isn't like it is pristine. I could see this being a case of just not a big enough name in a league with Chapman, Kimbrel, and Rosenthal.  Watson: There just isn't a ton of demand for a set-up man when every team needs a rep and every team has at least one reliever that could make it. Might be a case of just too much for a guy who isn't head and shoulders above the rest.  Cervelli: No chance. The average is nice but he has no other counting numbers, like none. And HRs and RBIs, like or not, matter.  My honest predictions, taking everything into account: Cole (starter), Burnett, McCutchen.  And we are all gonna bitch about Mark and Marte."

buccos,3ae7nf,Gameroomvids,2,Fri Jun 19 17:15:56 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree, and I think he makes it (another solid W would make it almost a sure thing) I'm just saying there is reason for doubt when there are a lot of good pitchers."
buccos,3ae7nf,TrueSouldier,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:01:17 2015 UTC,Burnett: Great numbers although the wins aren't there (and like it or not they matter for the All-Star game)    Kevin Correia's 11 win/4+ ERA All-star selection come screaming back to mind
buccos,3ae7nf,burnout9492,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:51:20 2015 UTC,"Cole will get in, McCutchen will probably get in... the voting thing is really stupid since the game decides home field advantage in the World Series. Why can't we vote on pitchers again?  Anyways, National league team should be able to beat the Royals to win the game."
buccos,3ae7nf,bazzone,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:59:47 2015 UTC,"I can almost guarantee Bochy will start Baumgartner due to his he played in the postseason last year. It's not supposed to matter, but it will. It definitely should be Cole, but i feel that not only will not start, he'll get snubbed completely. Same with Burnett. Cutch will get in on name alone in some way or another. Nobody else will make it."

It would be a mockery of baseball if Bochy were to include any Giants starter (which he certainly will) and not include Cole. But I can see where you are coming from on Bumgardner getting the start, it just screams ""Bruce Bochy"" to do that."

Two of my favorite dealings with Kendall:  After beating Gary Sheffield up, they were both elected to go to the All Star game.  Sheffield was quoted as saying something like ""This game is diluted now, every team has to be represented.  A guy like Kendall shouldn't even be here, I wouldn't walk across the clubhouse to shake his hand"".  When told about it, Kendall responded ""I guess he's seen enough of my hands"".  I love it. And of course he took a fastball to the thigh to load the bases and have B Giles hit a walkoff grand slam against Billy Wagner and the Astros.  One of my greatest Pirate memories."

buccos,3abe83,Ndcraze,7,Thu Jun 18 18:56:33 2015 UTC,This team seems to revitalize people.  Cervelli is just the latest example.
buccos,3abe83,Pretentious_Rush_Fan,2,Thu Jun 18 19:16:26 2015 UTC,very true. Even in our shit years we would sometimes get the occasional career year from a guy who then would immediately get a bad contract from another club.
buccos,3abe83,DTX180,4,Fri Jun 19 05:11:33 2015 UTC,Cervelli is 3rd behind Cutch and whoever made the sexual doughnuts ad
buccos,3abe83,OhwhatupCarlandJonny,2,Fri Jun 19 04:01:46 2015 UTC,I'd say Cutch or Cole.
buccos,3abe83,vecnyj,3,Fri Jun 19 03:45:28 2015 UTC,"Cervelli is one of the bargains of the year for sure but look at where this team was a couple months ago when Cutch was batting under .200. He's the real MVP and this team isn't even in contention without him. Biggest surprise of the year? Absolutely Cervelli. But not the most valuable player.  Not to downplay Cervelli as he's having a great year, but Stewart has been catching for Cole with similar results and the pitching staff was strong both of Martin's years too. It's hard to give a catcher too much credit for pitch framing when they've all pitched well without him."
buccos,3abe83,tonytroz,2,Fri Jun 19 02:18:18 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree, Cervelli's bat is likely to regress and CUTCH IS THE GREATEST. However, Martin is an elite framer and Stewart is well above average at pitch framing. proof"

In mid-May the J-Hay haters were out in full force when he was only batting .177 saying that that was his ceiling and last year was a fluke. Nothing worse than the idiots that think they know more than the people paid to make baseball decisions. A .304 May and .344 June shut them up.
buccos,3abe83,barkballin,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:39:49 2015 UTC,"Not hating on Cervelli as he is doing a great job this year and exceeding everyone's expectations.  At this point in the season it would have to Ray Searage..oh he can't have it?? Ok, give it to Cole"

PEDs might give you a bit more power and help you recover from injury faster. Steroids may not be the best example to give to the young and impressionable (sorry, athletes -- you're role models whether you like it or not) because of the dangers of abuse. But you still have to see the baseball. You still have to hit the baseball. There's no drug in the world that will infuse anyone with talent. That comes naturally, and I will admit through gritted teeth that Alex Rodriguez has talent spewing out his nose holes. Nobody who's a baseball fan can deny that."
