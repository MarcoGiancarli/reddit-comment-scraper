LoMMarket,3e5v6n,WarriorSolution,2,Wed Jul 22 04:49:39 2015 UTC,"Well, there have been few trades for this item, so my pricing will be based off of how much I got it for in the past, and how much I think the demand makes it worth. Overall I'd say these are a bit more rare than the purple rebel armour, worth perhaps 3gd each at full durability."

LoMMarket,3e5d0u,hailthechief1,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:44:24 2015 UTC,"Appraiser here to save the day. I'd say that since it's just under 60% full, it should be worth instead of 2.5gd more around the 1gd 40gb range. Enchanting adds ~1-2gd of value so in total the pants are worth 2gd 40gb to 3gd 40gb. I'd say the good middle price would be the middle price of 3gd 8gb"

LoMMarket,3e49k1,MJFurman_16,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:41:09 2015 UTC,Superman Jr.s are worth 25gb
LoMMarket,3e49k1,MJFurman_16,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:42:34 2015 UTC,"I dont know if your pricing is accurate MJ, I wasnt there for most of the event, but I do a friend who ran a booth, and I did run around a bit to check out district booths. Most of the pricing on drinks were between 2-4gb, and that is at the end of the event where as far as I know prices were raised. I don't think a quadrupling, tripling, or more than doubling of the base price after only 3 days is a very fair price. I'd say ~5gb is a more fair price.  Now for Superman Jr.'s, well I dont know where they were sold or given out, but I think 25gb is a little steep."
LoMMarket,3e49k1,JamhaloS,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:37:53 2015 UTC,"I'm the one who distributed and handled the drinks, I know what they're worth my friend. Also, you don't even know how many of each drink was handed out, I do. Less than half a stack, perhaps close to 20 Superman Jr's were given out btw."
LoMMarket,3e49k1,Morselizer,1 point,Wed Jul 22 15:31:52 2015 UTC,"I understand you were the one who handled the drinks at the event, and I respect you for that. My main comment was talking mainly about the booth drinks I wanted, i.e the Puppy Love and Castle Cola. Not the Superman Jr., as I just tacked on that at the end. I don't know how the Superman's were given out, either gift bags, prizes or just costing a lot, so until I find out more information I will consider your 25gb price point fair.   You're right I don't know how many drinks were given out, but I can simply just look around the balloons and find the pricing of many of the drinks. In your post you're selling a ""Dusk in Dwarven"" for 10gb when at the event they sold for 3gb. Making an over 300% price increase in three days should not be market value.   Now to get more specific, things like Spyds Sangria as far as I know were still being sold for 2gb at the end of the event, but something like a few of the barrens/sand dunes drinks were being sold for 10gb at the event. There shouldn't be a flat out rate for the drinks, but they should differ on pricing for them depending on how much they were sold for at the event.  I.e Liquid Gold was finally sold for 4gb and instead of being sold for 10gb it should, at this moment in time be sold for perhaps 6gb. Things like a few of the Barrens/Sand Dunes drinks were sold for 10gb at the event and instead of being priced at 6gb market value it should be priced at maybe 12gb. As you can tell I'm just adding 2gb to the base pricing, but it only has been 3 days and It shouldn't be raised crazy high.  All I'm trying to say is that there shouldn't be just a flat rate for every booth potion considering many of them were different in base pricing. I respect your pricing, and am not asking you to change it, as everyone is welcome to their own opinion on what the pricing should be. I just don't want 10gb for EVERY booth potion to be the ""official"" pricing, as it doesn't take into account most of the booth drinks base price, and also is quite high all things considered."

Netherward was selling Lord Bosco's Skull Crusher. Molotov Vodka is Westshire's. Castle Cola was from Mainstreet.

LoMMarket,3dfv96,vK_InFaMy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:08:29 2015 UTC,You are an appraiser bot :) I've never seen an appraisal request that has gone unfulfilled for more than 24 hours.
LoMMarket,3d5w6c,WarriorSolution,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:43:31 2015 UTC,I have both and the jacket is enchanted. I am thinking about selling them but not sure yet. what would your offers be?
LoMMarket,3d5qwk,bayboy02,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:07:04 2015 UTC,Here is an idea of what all your drinks are valued at but don't expect these prices because the value has gone down a little due to the fact these prices were during the inflation of drinks.///  Nisovhisky is ~15-20 GB/// Invigorating elixer is ~25 GB/// Edible bricks is ~25 GB/// Devils deal is ~25 GB/// Green fairy is ~25 GB///  I'm sorry I cant help you with the rest of your items because I'm not 100% sure of there value myself.
LoMMarket,3d5qwk,Ozziedwarf,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:47:27 2015 UTC,The blank plot deed is worth 5-10 bars tops
LoMMarket,3d5qwk,dionwaigand,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:34:50 2015 UTC,Nisovhiskey- 15gb Invigorating Elixer- 15gb Edible Bricks- 10gb Swammie 2.0- 10gb Cake- 25gb Devils Deal- 25gb Green Fairy- 10gb Blank Plot Deed- 5gb

LoMMarket,3d5qwk,inventrax,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:38:18 2015 UTC,"I see 4 comments, and in my mind the most likely comment to appear was ""Hey it's the appraiser"" >_<"
LoMMarket,3d5qwk,hailthechief1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:03:35 2015 UTC,"of course. It is your blessing, but also your curse."

LoMMarket,3cyw1d,MBGx_Unknown,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:06:57 2015 UTC,I have a rebel jacket (the normal back one) I would be willing to sell for 1gd
LoMMarket,3cx29w,Cestida,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:12:44 2015 UTC,"Banners as far as I know, are quite rare but once placed cannot be picked up again, like normal blocks. If that is so I'd price the banner at ~3gd though i am not very well versed in the pricing of this item so correct me if wrong. Can they be worn as in dvz also?"
LoMMarket,3cx29w,hailthechief1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:30:19 2015 UTC,"They cannot be worn by peasants. As far as i know, there are only 2 people with pink banners including me. If there are more people they have not made it known."
LoMMarket,3cx29w,hailthechief1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:33:14 2015 UTC,"Hmm okay then, I'd assume that if placed they cannot be picked up again, so Id say my pricing is about correct, probably worth 3.5-4gd"

LoMMarket,3cw01u,redtps,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:14:24 2015 UTC,"the boots are the hardest thing to come by, not many people have them and alot of people want them, i will keep my eye out for you, i might know a guy"
LoMMarket,3cw01u,Austin_Rimben,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:03:48 2015 UTC,Ye a full durability chestplate will run you 1gd while a full durability boots will cost you 2gd
LoMMarket,3cw01u,hailthechief1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:36:44 2015 UTC,If I could find the boots I would buy them for 2GD

LoMMarket,3cvtpb,Austin_Rimben,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:11:41 2015 UTC,"mine was a plot loot, worth buying a 140 gold plot :P"
LoMMarket,3cvtpb,hailthechief1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:13:12 2015 UTC,Very lucky loot to get ;P  Best I've gotten was like 1gd lol
LoMMarket,3cvtpb,Fire_Fly_,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:22:10 2015 UTC,"Go talk to /u/Fire_Fly_, the guy found 19 diamonds, deadboots and who knows what else. On a related note I sold my minecart for 4gd"
LoMMarket,3cvtpb,hailthechief1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:26:21 2015 UTC,And around 10 double chests of stams ;P
LoMMarket,3cvtpb,Kobold_Number_4,2,Sat Jul 11 12:24:53 2015 UTC,"I did the math, and give or take you found 51-59 diamonds in plot looting O_o  19gd in gold, 17gd in stam pots (Selling, 25 using), 15gd for deadboots.. equals 51-59gd >_<"
LoMMarket,3cvqth,Balbur,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:27:52 2015 UTC,"Also, thinking about it, I wouldn't be surprised if it's frowned upon to sell these considering people paid actual money for some of these and we got them for free. Either way, I'd still like to find out if selling them is ethical."
LoMMarket,3cvqth,Austin_Rimben,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:29:01 2015 UTC,"i wouldnt think the same policy, but i dont think they should be sold, they were mistakenly given out. but if someone is selling them go for it. i gave mine away... againihaveaproblem"
LoMMarket,3cvqth,dionwaigand,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:30:01 2015 UTC,"ok, i missed out, what happend? he gave out a stam pot, if its just a stam pot i dont think its a gig deal"
LoMMarket,3cvqth,WarriorSolution,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:32:12 2015 UTC,Nisovin accidently gave everyone online(~60 people) a World Stamina Potion.
LoMMarket,3cvqth,dionwaigand,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:38:24 2015 UTC,"whoopty doo, its just a stamina potion either way, stamina shouldn't be sold on here in the first place."
LoMMarket,3cvqth,titleproblems,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:12:22 2015 UTC,"I think these are fine. It's the ""World Potion"" that gives everyone a stam pot when you drink it. Nisovin messed up by giving out loads for free, someone's gonna end up selling theirs anyway."
LoMMarket,3cvqth,bullseye2230,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:38:47 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think it should be fine to sell them. even if you can pay money to get them, they are ""rare"", and they aren't stolen, so there's no reason why selling them shouldn't be allowed.  that said, if its ones that were actually bought, I don't really see why anyone would sell them. I imagine that once all the ones Nisovin gave out are gone, there wont be any more on here anyway, and it wont matter anymore."
LoMMarket,3cvqth,WarriorSolution,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:28:37 2015 UTC,"60 people with >WORLD< Stamina Potions.  That means 60 Stamina potions for everyone, equal to about 3GDs.  It's not about the Stamina Potions, more so the money they give or people selling their World Stamina Pots."
LoMMarket,3cvqth,_Han,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:07:43 2015 UTC,I'd pay a diamond for it.
LoMMarket,3cvqth,dionwaigand,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:23:11 2015 UTC,"Oh ok, now that i know what they are, i would say no, if they were not meant to be given out then i dont think you should sell them just like the from outside the the walls."
LoMMarket,3cvqth,dionwaigand,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:08:30 2015 UTC,"Still really not sure as to whether I have a green-light to sell these things. So far two mods have said yes, and one has said no."
LoMMarket,3cve84,vmwareguy_2,2,Sat Jul 11 02:25:47 2015 UTC,"i dont know of any, but i will look out for ya"
LoMMarket,3cve84,Austin_Rimben,2,Sat Jul 11 04:33:24 2015 UTC,"unfortunately, swords are one of those items where you don't ask for offers, you go looking for them. most people with swords wont sell them or will charge a reasonably ludicrous price. (swords are really rare, and really nice).  but GL, and maybe you'll get lucky :)"
LoMMarket,3cve84,bullseye2230,2,Sat Jul 11 07:30:44 2015 UTC,"Ye, what bullseye said, better to ask for a price range than to wait for offers on a sword. I doubt you will get any offers here, not trying to be pessimistic but you'll probably have to go out in LoM and find one, since the community here probably wouldn't sell their swords. Anyway, even a used wooden sword will usually go for 4gd to I believe 6gd so happy hunting and good luck!"
LoMMarket,3cve84,hailthechief1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:29:49 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks for the feedback guys, I appreciate it."

LoMMarket,3crkkp,_Han,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:46:48 2015 UTC,"I'd say the being stacked doesn't really add price, But you can sell them for 1 - 2 GB each and make some good gold."
