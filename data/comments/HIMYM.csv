HIMYM,3e2pre,Winterlands,34,Tue Jul 21 14:32:56 2015 UTC,"This was the first ""first-run"" episode my wife and I caught from HIMYM, after finding it and falling in love with it - we went and bought the DVDs and caught up any way we could to get on board with the new episodes.  Its original air date, 1/3/11, also happened to be the anniversary of my wife's father's death (we were not married, so I'm not sure ""father-in-law"" is the proper term). Having that ending come out of left field, I took one look at my wife and just saw the tears forming. It was probably one of the most heart wrenching things we ever watched on TV.  Between that episode, and the fact that one of her father's favorite songs was The Proclaimers' I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles), HIMYM was quickly cemented as 'our show'.   To this day, Bad News and Last Words are the only 2 episodes we will not rewatch."

HIMYM,3e2pre,Zagann,13,Tue Jul 21 20:43:15 2015 UTC,My Dad was sick with terminal cancer when this episode aired. I was staying in his house taking care of him at the time. I remember sobbing at the end of this episode and going into my Dad's room just to hug him and tell him how much I loved him. I haven't re-watched the series since it aired but I'm not sure I would be able to watch this episode again.
HIMYM,3e2pre,leetyourmakeup,5,Tue Jul 21 16:35:58 2015 UTC,Similar story. My dad had just passed away from cancer a few months prior to this episode. I try my best to skip this episode on every rewatch because of it.
HIMYM,3e2pre,Holovoid,2,Tue Jul 21 17:36:29 2015 UTC,Similar story here too...he passed away 4 days after it aired.  I'm able to rewatch it now but if I'm already in a sad mood I have to skip it.

HIMYM,3e2pre,mbrw12,18,Tue Jul 21 17:21:20 2015 UTC,Knowing the director left Jason Segel and Alyson Hannigan in the dark for that episode and most of that ending is improvised made me watch it differently. It's like he's truly feeling the pain and you can see the shock in his eyes. Definitely one of the most memorable / intense scenes in the entire series.  http://m.imdb.com/title/tt1795967/trivia

HIMYM,3e2pre,Semper-Fido,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:16:48 2015 UTC,"This episode is why HIMYM is cemented alongside Scrubs as my all time favorites. They can do comedy, and in the next scene have you crying. They do it all so well! Like so many of you this one was rough for me too. My father has always been like a best friend to me. And less than 6 months prior, he had tried to commit suicide to escape the terrors of PTSD and depression (but survived due to nothing short of a miracle). Those feelings of nearly losing him were still fairly fresh, and I had always related to Marshall and his relationship to his father. So when the time came and that workshop was empty, ugh I can still feel my stomach drop. It was like the world just crushed me again. That ending could not have been done better, and while it hurt it makes me appreciate the show so much more because of how they treated these subjects."

I'll never forgive them for what they did to me! NEVER!!!  Actually, I don't really care much at all. I was disappointed with the rapid fire finale. I think the most interesting part was a point my friend made. She said that Robin - with all her professional success, her sweet apartment, her dogs, and her world travels - still needed a man in the end. What message does that send? I think my friend might be overthinking it but it was still interesting to me.  Speaking of rapid fire futures, the Parks and Rec finale was on FF for the entire episode. That finale was done really well and really enjoyable for me to watch. They even killed off a character without ruining the whole series. Good times."
HIMYM,3drmh4,mikeramey1,2,Sun Jul 19 00:08:18 2015 UTC,"PRetty much. The ending and how ""bad"" it is transcends just show watchers. Everyone knows the ending ""sucked"" even though personally I didn't mind it."
HIMYM,3drmh4,Mark_Zajac,7,Sun Jul 19 05:38:11 2015 UTC,"I did mind it.  We spend nine years hearing about Ted getting over Robin so he can meet the mother. He meets her and then she's dead. Ted goes back to Robin - someone he has never been able to have a successful relationship with. That's a real bummer.  I hated the ending so much that I don't ever watch the show anymore. In fact, I'm not even sure why I subscribe here, other than to commiserate with people who hated the ending."
HIMYM,3drmh4,mikeramey1,4,Sat Jul 18 23:35:19 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I can see why most people hated it. It just got to a point around the middle of the run when I accepted that the show was wrongly titled. This was never how Ted meets the mother, it was Ted's awesome life in New York with his friends - watching the show from that perspective, I never really cared all that much about the mother. If they'd have introduced her in the final episode, a la 500 Days of Summer and the ending of that, then I probably wouldn't have cared all that much.   Also he meets her, lives with her, has kids with her, gets married to her, grows old, then she dies. It's not like she dies the day after her meets her. But I'm not going to try and defend the finale, it sits well with some people and doesn't with others and that's fine."
HIMYM,3drmh4,Mark_Zajac,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:41:48 2015 UTC,"The idea of Ted ""getting over Robin so he can meet The Mother"" is an urban legend, invented by teen girls who went ""squee"" over Barney Stinson.     The writers left mountains of evidence that Ted was not getting over Robin.  We saw in ""Milk"" that Ted was offered his ""perfect match"" -- a woman who wanted marriage and children -- but Ted chose Robin.  He said ""I don't want perfect, I want Robin.""  We saw in ""Shelter Island"" that Stella asked Ted to speak with Tony but, out of loyalty, Ted chose to speak with Robin; consequently, Ted was left at the alter.  We saw in ""Doppelgängers"" that Ted said ""yes"" to whatever Robin wanted, without knowing what she wanted.  We saw in ""Symphony of Illumination"" that Ted skipped Christmas with his parents to cheer-up Robin.  We saw in ""Autumn of Breakups"" that Victoria was willing to marry Ted but, once again, Ted chose Robin.      Where did you get the crazy idea that Ted is ""getting over"" Robin?      The writers used “Sunrise” to address bogus fan theories directly; Robin’s mention of an “e-mail chain” makes her a proxy for the viewers. Speaking through Ted, the writers are emphatic that Robin was the only contender.   If that wasn't enough, Ted gave that whole speech on the bridge.     So, after more than eight season, there was absolutely no evidence that Ted was changing his views on Robin."

Never letting go isn't healthy and he was convinced that letting go would mean losing it forever. Do you really want to attach yourself to a balloon (that doesn't love you) for the rest of you life? Should your main reason be ""because I might lose it""?  I have to re watch that episode, I can't really remember why he let go, all I remember is that cheesy scene with Robin floating away."

There is a character in OHYOS named Remedios the Beauty; she is so impossibly perfect that she simply ascends into heaven one day. It seems that Robin recreated this, by floating away, reflecting Ted's view of Robin as perfect.     This is just another example of the ""magical realism"" that HIMYM borrows from the works of Gabriel García Márquez."

We saw in ""Something Blue"" that it was Ted who let Robin go -- she tearfully pled against parting.  We saw in ""The Final Page, Part II"" that Ted ordered Robin from the limo, setting her free to be with Barney."

As for the last sentence, I think it was season 8 episode 2 that summed it up best. It's classic Ted to do the chivalrous thing but then almost immediately regret said chivalrous action. His brain's able to override his emotional logic for a little bit.   It is interesting though that Robin, either via stage direction or just through Cobie's acting (though it could've been unintentional since Cobie didn't know about the finale until mid season 9), did always want to keep Ted on the hook throughout the series. Along with those moments, I remember a The Front Porch where Robin seemed disappointed when Ted suggested that they still need time apart and she brought up the 40 pact."
HIMYM,3dtewb,Mark_Zajac,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:47:03 2015 UTC,"So Ted wasn't over Robin then even after the wedding?   I don't think so.  He just found a way to love her differently.  The point of ""Sunrise"" was that you never stop loving somebody, even if you let them go.  You can let a person go without invalidating your love for that person.      His brain's able to override his emotional logic for a little bit.   To me, this does not give Ted enough credit.  Think of Ted and Marshall at MacLaren's in ""The Final Page: Part II"" when Marshall gives Ted permission to be selfish.  Ted refuses.  Yeah, sure, Ted is hurt about Robin choosing Barney in ""Band or DJ"" but that just makes him human.  Ted had days to decide about delivering Robin to Barney.  I think your words ""for a bit"" are too harsh.      People overlook Barney's sociopathic lechery but when Ted does the right thing it is discounted as ""false"" chivalry.  Harsh.      always want to keep Ted on the hook   To me, this does not give Robin enough credit.  We saw in ""The Magician's Code, Part 2"""" that Robin pushed Ted to reconnect with Victoria      via stage direction... in ""The Front Porch""... Robin seemed disappointed when Ted suggested that they still need time apart    It would be very interesting to know when Pamela Fryman was informed of the ending, since she directed almost every episode.  At the end of ""No Pressure"" when Marshall says that Ted is ""fine"" there is a moment there when Robin does not look fine herself.    she brought up the 40 pact.   Right!  Robin's idea!  Bless you!  So many people overlook this point."
HIMYM,3dtewb,Mark_Zajac,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:18:21 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to clarify what you thought Ted's mindset was after his actions this episode. As for the rest of it...   To me, this does not give Ted enough credit. Think of Ted and Marshall at MacLaren's in ""The Final Page: Part II"" when Marshall gives Ted permission to be selfish. Ted refuses. Yeah, sure, Ted is hurt about Robin choosing Barney in ""Band or DJ"" but that just makes him human. Ted had days to decide about delivering Robin to Barney. I think your words ""for a bit"" are too harsh.     People overlook Barney's sociopathic lechery but when Ted does the right thing it is discounted as ""false"" chivalry. Harsh.   I'm just saying Ted's able to recognize the right thing and do the right thing immediately even if he's emotionally unprepared for it, as exemplified in the episode where he let Victoria's ex-fiance move in with them.   To bring it back to letting Robin marry Barney, I realize there was a time clock for Barney's proposal, but emotionally he wasn't okay with Robin and Barney together. It's one thing to do the right thing, it's another to be okay with doing the right thing, and that's all I meant by that.   To me, this does not give Robin enough credit. We saw in ""The Magician's Code, Part 2"""" that Robin pushed Ted to reconnect with Victoria   To be fair, that example was also after Ted straight up tells Robin he can't be on her hook anymore because there's some part of him that'll be waiting to hit to happen.    We see in ""The Rough Patch"" that Robin sticks with Ted when Barney tries to offer Robin the ""marry at 40"" pact himself. If all Robin wanted was a fall-back position, she could have gone ahead and taken the deal from Barney.   Given the deleted scene between Robin/Ted, the story was meant to indicate that on some level, Robin always was hoping she'd be able to be with Ted once she's mentally ready, but at least in that specific example, she already made the deal with Ted when Barney brought it up. As to why she didn't take it again later on, it's likely because of the stigma of being Barney's ""ex-husband"" that made it impossible for the two on some level to get back together since they've tried it and got divorced. At least on Barney's end, Robin scarred him and only Ellie was able to level him out."

HIMYM,3dhusv,natlach,5,Fri Jul 17 03:03:44 2015 UTC,"This!  I too loved the ending plot-wise but there was a lot of wasted opportunity to flesh out the plot lines of the other main characters and get the audience on-board with the finale before it happened.   What really bothers me is that the producers/creator crumpled under the pressure of the fans and starting trying to appease them after the fact (the re-cut ending). There are plenty of TV shows that end where the fans didn't like the final episode (Sopranos, Dexter, Lost, X-Files, etc) but just stand by the product and people calm down over time."
HIMYM,3dhusv,venom02,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:04:54 2015 UTC,"yeah but neither way works. Sopranos, Dexter and Lost still are examples of crappy written ending as this show even with the re-cut ending which basically no one saw."
HIMYM,3dhusv,natlach,2,Fri Jul 17 09:48:10 2015 UTC,"Right, those shows had quite a backlash with the finale.  But when I hear people talk about Sopranos, the initial let down of the finale doesn't stop people from re-watching or recommending the show to others.  Dexter it's too soon to tell if that will happen.  With Lost, I again was in the camp that was ok with the ending but with that show it seemed to depend on why a person watched it in the first place.  If you just cared about mysteries being solved, then you hated the ending.  If you were invested in the characters then the finale got a better response.  With HIMYM, while I feel they could've done more to prep the audience for the finale, it covered the bases and made sense with how they told the story.  If they had cut out some of the filler episodes in the final season and maybe spent 2-4 episodes at the end exploring life for all the characters after the moment Ted met the mother, then it would be less rushed and more complete.  And probably cause less backlash.  2-4 episode arc we could have seen:   We could see the Robin/Barney marriage flounder and how it contributed to all their life changes. We could see the struggles that Marshall and Lily go through to adjust to family, friends, and career developments. And of course, we'd have much more time falling for Ted and Tracy's relationship so her death is more impactful to the story.  I actually would have loved to see a scene or two where he was coping with her death .   Overall, it was a story that really was about how he was ""totally in love with Aunt Robin."" and trying to get his kids on board.  This was the story all along, otherwise the focus would have drifted away from Robin as a love interest early on in the series.  The more I rewatch, the more I like the ending.  The recut version is very bland imo and was more an afterthought than anything.  But there are some that will never be happy because it didn't live up to potential and that's ok too.  Still a good show in my book."

HIMYM,3dhusv,DaveyCrickett,0,Thu Jul 16 22:34:49 2015 UTC,"I'll always make this argument. Ted didn't need to tell what happened to each of his friends in great detail. Both kids were alive for that to happen, and the reason why Ted is telling the story is to tell his kids how he meet their mother, not to pander to a crowd that he had never met before. We may have had a better ending if he was telling the story to his class at college, but that wouldn't make sense thematically. Also, I'm sure he doesn't want to take his kids through the death of their mother again anyway. It's a great ending thematically, but not perfect storytelling-wise."

HIMYM,3dhusv,Legend-WaitForItDary,24,Fri Jul 17 11:08:49 2015 UTC,"Im just gonna put it this way, I dont know how quickly you watched the series in its entirety, But when you started watching has a huge impact on how you vew the finale. For me I started near the beginning and this is how I feel, HIMYM became a weekly ritual for years me and my group of friends. For years I had this show that taught me thing showed me some perspective and made me laugh harder then any other show. And for all these years we as a fan base had this thing we could look forward to The Mother. It helped us get through Ted's promiscuity and telling stories about random girls he hooked up with it got us through the sad moments of bad breakups of Ted because we knew he had ""The One"" to make it all better. The show is literally called How I Met Your ""MOTHER"". So it set them up for this super hard standard to live up to. Then the fucking nail it, Tracy was everything we could of hoped for. The buildup was great everything was so well done (1/2)"
HIMYM,3dhusv,dys206,23,Thu Jul 16 16:39:33 2015 UTC,"It was awesome, it made sense and everyone was happy. But then the finale happened and it kind of destroyed everything. Not only did it destroy the entirety of the 9 season of the arch of the mother in way to quickly of a period. But it also destroyed the entirety of the importance of the wedding and the Barney and Robin narrative. It was basically a slap in the face to the long time viewer, everything they made us care about for the years of watching in one episode didn't mean as much. It just fucking hurt, and I understand the it began with Robin it should end with Robin argument, while it does make sense don't name the show HIMYM then because its not what the show was about. Ill try and stop rambling but that's why I don't like the ending there's other reasons but that's the main one. (2/2)"

HIMYM,3dhusv,HybridSamurai,4,Thu Jul 16 19:28:56 2015 UTC,What the fuck do you think real life is. The whole point is it was unrealistic.
HIMYM,3dhusv,WantedAnimalRapist,0,Fri Jul 17 00:40:29 2015 UTC,"Real life has no screen play. No meaning, no purpose, no plan, no justice, no karma, no appeal for a consumer of commercials."

HIMYM,3dhusv,One_Eyed_Bear,10,Fri Jul 17 16:15:57 2015 UTC,"If realism is crawling back to the person who caused you basically nothing but pain for years, is a known cheater, destroyed multiple of the happiest most fulfilling relationships and having Ted be willing to jump back into a relationship with one of his bestfriends ex wife  then yes it is realistic (And sadly that does happen). But heres my stance, him ending up with Robin makes no sense through out the seasons we learned why they didnt work and the characters grew to accept that, they moved on the grew and the changed. Robin want what she cant have and is scared of commitment so it doesnt make sense. I cant see how a guy like Ted who talks about love and relationships and heartbreak the way that he does doing that. But all that is besides the point HIMYM has never been a show based on realism. Its a narrative about characters that does teach us about life. While im ""ok"" with how it ended the realism defense makes the least sense to me."
HIMYM,3dhusv,lolthrowthis,3,Thu Jul 16 19:51:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the real reason I hated the ending was that I wanted the Absolute best for Ted, and he finally achieved that. Then it was taken away and replaced with Robin who I thought was annoying, rude, and not at all a good match for Ted."
HIMYM,3dhusv,SirRossington,0,Fri Jul 17 07:07:18 2015 UTC,"You are being too specific here. It's kind of like you live your life and you think it has some goal, or a purpose. You  make plans and then you make achievements. But in the end something happens and it turns everything upside down. What you thought is important becomes optional, your achievements turn out useless, what you thought was happening according to some plan turns out to be completely random. I am not talking about the characters here, it's more about the audience and the writers. Actually, what I was answering is your expression ""slap in the face"". The ""real life"" likes to deliver them sometimes. And from this point of view maybe we should thank the writers for that they didn't go full realistic :)"
HIMYM,3dhusv,ezrubie7,9,Fri Jul 17 10:35:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Waiting 8 years for 20 minutes of the mother, and for her ultimately to die is devastating. Also sitting through countless episodes (weeks) of Ted getting over Robin for him to do a 180 back to her is dissapointing. For all the netflixers that watch the show over a couple weeks, their total time spent anticipating the mother and the ending is a small fraction of the original viewers, so it's hard for it to hold the same level of dissapointment."

HIMYM,3dhusv,Lorigga,2,Thu Jul 16 19:21:26 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed the ending too, it was devastating and I probably used up a whole tissue box in that one episode but I loved it.   I feel like that ending was the best way to justify the whole premise of the show - Ted telling his kids how he met their mother, no one would sit through all that if their mother was alive & healthy.   It also justifies Ted talking about Robin so much, he needed to show his kids that what he wanted to do was the right move for everyone.  Ted talking about the wedding and the aftermath allowed him to explain what had happened to Robin and why she was also single, it all worked perfectly on my opinion."
HIMYM,3dhusv,mikeramey1,2,Thu Jul 16 23:22:37 2015 UTC,"no one would sit through all that if their mother was alive & healthy.   That was my response when people were coming up with their theories of how it was going to end.  Why was he telling this story in the first place?  My money was on her death from the beginning.  I felt like any time Robin was mentioned in connection to Ted's kids, it was pointing towards her filling void left by the mother otherwise, it might be kinda weird for Tracey to let her kids hang out with her husband's former love of his life."

The final season is bad, the finale is bad, and the ending of the series is bad. This series went off track long before the show ended but to spend so much time telling the story of Ted moving on from Robin, only for him to get back with Robin, is a pretty disheartening story. I don't watch the reruns anymore because the ending of the series was so disappointing to me.   EDIT: This has been marked a controversial comment? Take a minute to learn what those arrows are for.

HIMYM,3dhusv,satanpigeon666,2,Thu Jul 16 18:12:34 2015 UTC,"Yes. It's like we saw Ted do all these things to move forward with his life. For years we watched this guy learn hard life lessons and then what does he do? Goes right back to the relationship that has never worked out for him. Why did I even watch that?   It's about the journey. This show is full of memorable, fun moments along the way but the destination was terrible and that makes the trip a lot less fun. The ending ruined the show. So disappointing.  The creators admitted it was the wrong ending. I feel like this will probably hurt syndication and DVD/online sales. Watch HIMYM disappear from Netflix and other streaming services. I hope the consequences of this terrible ending will prevent future series from ending so terribly."
HIMYM,3dhusv,subtle_nirvana92,5,Thu Jul 16 19:08:11 2015 UTC,"That's because it was terrible, almost unanimously.  I feel like those that 'liked' it may not have totally been paying attention to what was really going on throughout the series.  It was a gigantic slap in the face.    The writers themselves have even finally admitted that they regret it."
HIMYM,3dhusv,flutterfly28,18,Thu Jul 16 16:00:02 2015 UTC,I feel like instead of not paying attention they may also just be watching at a fast pace on Netflix. I hated the ending because it completely disregarded personalities and eight seasons of character building were completely gone. Years and years of getting familiar with these fictional characters didn't even matter in the last season for those who had been watching since it was first on the air.
HIMYM,3dhusv,adamshell,3,Thu Jul 16 16:41:57 2015 UTC,It's because you didn't watch it when it was airing so you most likely binged on it. So Robin and Teds relationship was still somewhat fresh rather than dragged out for everyone else of 8 years.

HIMYM,3dhusv,The_Time_Master,5,Thu Jul 16 15:11:41 2015 UTC,"I'd say it was 100% pacing. That last season definitely has funny moments, but to spend all season, 30 minutes a week, watching it get drawn out to that ending was medicore. I don't dislike how it actually ended(I definitely don't love it) but the pacing was slow, and despite the funny moments, there are plenty without. Which hurt the ending for me.   During the middle years of the show I was a big fan, and thought it was consistently one of the smartest, funniest show on network TV. Hell, I grew up with this show. I was in 6th grade when I started watching it when it first aired. There are definitely better paths out there to a similar ending instead of the one they chose."

HIMYM,3dhusv,triculous,2,Fri Jul 17 04:25:20 2015 UTC,"At first I doubted the whole ""everything happens in a weekend"" time frame, but I understood that they did it so they could spend more time on the characters and the flashbacks than the actual plot. The way they introduced the mother was great. It was like they slowed down the narrative just to put more emphasis on the character's relationships (Ted and Robin, Robin and Barney, Marshall and Lilly, Ted and the Mother, the Mother and everyone else)  But after watching the finale, it kind of ruined that perception because most of the development was scrapped in just 40 minutes. If you had watch the last episode right after season 8 ends, you wouldn't miss a thing. And that's what annoys me, it's like wasted potential.   Imo, it would have been much better to end the wedding halfway through the season and spend the rest of it deconstructing every relationship or not undoing everything in the last episode."

I felt like the entire 9 seasons before the last ten minutes of the finale were just a setup for a joke about ted really wanting to bang robin. The show was always going to deliver a ""happily ever after"", it was called "" how I met your mother"" after all, not ""how your mother and met, had kids, lived, and died"", it was roughly supposed to end there. We didn't need the wrap up of what everyone was doing because we'd seen the future in the occasional flash forward or explanation of what people went on to be. Instead it went on to do a montage of character assassinations (barney is the big one, but Tracey is the literal one) just so they can make a joke about ted doing the unexpected thing of running after robin one last time (which is odd considering that they just spent a season talking about how they both moved past that and that barney and robin were actually the perfect couple)."
HIMYM,3dhusv,sorin255,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:53:53 2015 UTC,"I just finished going through the series again.  I've been a fan of the show since the beginning of the 6th season and it is the one TV show I always go back to.  It's hard for me to explain this to people who have never seen it or have written it off because it's a sitcom, but it's my desert island entertainment.    The finale wasn't hurt by the content or the story that it wrapped it, it was hurt by the entire structure of the final season.  They made so many ill-fated mistakes and took us to so may places that no one cared about, that when the finale came around it felt like the creators and writers said ""oh shit, right.  We have to finish this whole 'mother' thing and try to give some closure on these characters.""  This is the only season of the show that has episodes that I skip, because they are completely off base with the characters and distract from the overall storyline.  (I dislike the rhyming episode THE MOST, even more than the slap episode).  Some thoughts (not that these matter, but a fan can dream, right?) on how they could have finessed this final season and given the fans (devoted and otherwise) a better overall experience.   Get Marshall back to the group quicker; his little roadtrip was too drawn out and none of us wanted to see our group broken up for that long.  Spend more than one episode on the mother and her life, and continue with the crazy web of coincidences and missed chances that this show did so expertly well.  There is no other show that bends time as well as HIMYM and they seemed to forget everything they learned from the previous 8 episodes. get rid of the filler - I said this already and so have a number of other people, but I could care less about bedtime stories and fake history that lasts AN ENTIRE EPISODE.  Barney's fake histories and made up stories are wonderful and entertaining, but from Marshall's perspective and one that lasts an entire episode was like receiving that slap of a million exploding suns right to my face. show us more of Marshall and Lily in Italy - that small flashforward was great, and they could have tied that into Ted's life somehow. The finale had way more than 2 episodes of material in it, spread it out!   I feel like I'm saying the same thing over and over so I'm going to stop.  There are still great moments from the finale (Ted's speech about loving the mother as much as he can was fantastic, as was Barney's speech to his newborn daughter) and I'm not angry at the outcome (I liked Tracy, but if she's got to die, she's got to die, just SHOW US MORE!).  TL:DR - The finale suffered from the final season being too disjointed and too far removed from the rest of the series. Had they provided more of what we loved about the show and less filler, the finale wouldn't have been so much of a shock to us all."
HIMYM,3dhusv,Shrimpables,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:13:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think that someone who binge watched the show on Netflix has the same experience as those who spent years watching the show.   The first problem with the final season is that they had the whole wedding, which was only for the weekend, stretched out into this long and dragging plot. And then by the end of it all they have one mother-centric episode and then kill her off just in a passing narration.   And then Barney and Robin split up out of no where after dancing around the issue since forever.   Looking back, it was still a rushed bad ending."
HIMYM,3dhusv,AlvisDBridges,3,Thu Jul 16 17:55:31 2015 UTC,"As someone who liked the ending I agree with your post entirely. My issue (and I suspect a lot of people's ) isn't with the actual ending. This show was always How I Met Your Aunt Robin. The problem was the execution of the entire last season, where you meandered through 22 episodes at a snails pace and then rushed through the last hour you had on television. Everything could have been accepted more warmly by the fans had it been given the proper timing. The Barney and Robin breakup was entirely logical but needed to be more than a b/c-plot on 1 episode. Tracy dying would have been tough to swallow but even still acceptable. Robin and Ted ending up together would have been better if it was given more than a single ""I married the wrong guy"" line from Robin in again, one singular episode. They gave the viewers way too much to process all at once because they insisted on holding their cards close until the actual finale.    As much as I'd love to defend the ending and as much as I get/liked what they were going for, I just can't expect people to be as forgiving as I was when you had a 22 episode long wedding. I watch so many great television shows that don't get quite popular enough to where they struggle staying on air or get cancelled outright and have to cram their stories into much smaller timeframes to cry for people whose greatest fault was having too many episodes than they knew what to do with. Had this been handled like the Parks and Rec final season you'd be talking about at worst a 50/50 split."

There are so many arguments that constantly come up on this sub (character development, for one) that I could delve into my whole-hearted disagreements with, but the one I will talk about here is the pacing of the final season.  No. The final season was not good, in my opinion. There were some episodes that actually became difficult to watch. In a perfect world, it would have been half as long, or a lot of the season would have fleshed out what we saw in the finale instead of giving us weird rhyming episodes and Marshall not interacting with any of the core characters. But in reality, this wasn't possible. Jason Segal clearly didn't want to keep filming the show. He had moved on to other projects and that's why he was stuck in the car for the entire first half of season 9. Same setting (the car), same characters (Daphne and baby Marvin), same clothes (their not changing in the car), phone calls (can be filmed separately from the other characters) = significantly less time filming.  Everyone is constantly bashing the writers for their pacing choices for the final season, but they were kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place. There are definitely decisions they made that I disagree with, but I think they were more the result of circumstance rather than Carter and Craig randomly turning into horrible writers.   We can be upset because of the potential that wasn't realized, but this anger and constant pining over how season 9 should have been the finale but more stretched out simply isn't realistic and is so frustrating to constantly read."

HIMYM,3djlms,hayhaymonster,4,Sat Jul 18 05:03:21 2015 UTC,"Bingers see more and hear more about Robin, so Robin getting the happy ending makes better sense for them.   I had been thinking exactly this myself, though I'd like to express the idea in slightly different terms.  If a viewer liked Ted and Robin together, in the early seasons, it was easy to binge-forward past the rough patches, until the next point at which they reconnected.  The writers did give Ted and Robin little moments, along the way, and, if you binge, those moments come with just enough frequency to keep hope alive.      I read an article, somewhere, in which Carter Bays and Craig Thomas explicitly stated that they deliberately set out to make HIMYM good for binge watching.  I read a different article which claimed that ratings for HIMYM jumped significantly when it became available for streaming on Netflix.  So, in some ways the show was almost designed for binging and bingers are likely to enjoy it more.      You hit the nail on the head!"
HIMYM,3djlms,Mark_Zajac,2,Thu Jul 16 22:03:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I had the same feeling when watching Friends. I didn't feel that Ross & Rachel was that complicated because for me, it happened in 2 weeks, not 10 freaking years."

HIMYM,3dkbvj,rose_tattoo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:00:51 2015 UTC,"I feel like a huge part of why they were together and eventually why things didn't work out (the second time) was because of the timing and everything that happened with Victoria.

For example, we know from ""Milk"" that Ted wanted to name his kids Luke and Leia.  In the ""Star Wars"" mythos, ""The Mother"" always dies early.

HIMYM,3djkav,rose_tattoo,-2,Fri Jul 17 05:49:16 2015 UTC,"In retrospect, Barney was written with total consistency.  Fatherhood, not Robin, was the ending that Barney deserved, and (secretly) wanted, all along!     In the English language, “love” is an over-loaded word.  Wisely, the ancient Greeks had four different words: “eros” (carnal love), “philia” (brotherly love), ""storge"" (parental love) and “agapé” (abiding love).  Barney self-medicates with eros and philia but, throughout series, his heart is set on storge.     Barney is fixated on parental love.  He tries to seduce Ted’s mother, repeatedly.  When Robin calls for help with her locket, Barney dallies to play laser-tag with her father, choosing storge over Robin.  On the eve of his wedding, Barney is still obsessed with reuniting his parents.  Ostensibly, “The Lighthouse” reveals that Barney accepts Robin’s infertility but in the “scrambled egg” contest, Barney and (pregnant) Lilly both side with Loretta.  Her eggs are the best; she has storge to give, even a motherly hug for Robin.     With laser-tag and tantrums, Barney keeps himself in a childlike state, to stay elligible for storge.  He has a playbook, involving dress-up,  and he childishly begs people to play along: ""Just... OK? Just…”  He is a child, something Robin never wanted, as those who dislike her with Ted always carp.  The irony is that storge has two points of access: the child and the parent.  Barney attains storge — the love of his life! — through fatherhood, something that Robin can never give him.     Edit: Down-voting won't change the facts.  Seeing is believing: this happened!"

One thing though: I think the Downtown Train song should remain the background song during the scene on the platform. Otherwise, excellent edit."

Just think that's significant. I don't think the show meant to imply that Ted was putting it off because of Robin, but I do think that talk woke Ted up so to speak and made him realize he should lock it down.  2) the fan edit did it's best with what it got (and it was a nice touch in cutting out the comedic grounding), but there's still gotta be grieving room. Even with the montage of Ted/Robin with the scenes of Tracy's implicit permission, I wish they showed Ted grieving throughout the years, or Ted/Robin reconnecting during the mourning times. It's still a rather jarring jump.  3) wish the edit kept the Marshall/Lily deleted scene at the end with the bet. That was personally a great note to end the series on."

When Marshall and lily ask who the girl he met was, Ted said the bass guitar player from the wedding band and they knew who she was. He probably told the same thing to robin and barney... so by the time they met her they already knew who to expect."

HIMYM,3dgnxj,rose_tattoo,0,Thu Jul 16 05:49:12 2015 UTC,A) they shot multiple endings.  B) they abandoned the direction they had taken the show creatively to slap on some random ending.

HIMYM,3dgnxj,shiftry,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:10:06 2015 UTC,"Well, it's based on a real life relationship from what my half-assed reddit-research has told me. Even if it isn't, a divorce seems believable between the two. And they do it in a happy-ish way. I'm okay with the divorce. I wish the ending wasn't set up for a Robin-Ted ending in general. Seeing as it was I wish they'd make the weak joke they had set up for several seasons.   If they weren't going to close out the series on a weak one liner they should've ended much better IMO. How it would be much better, well, I dunno, I'm not a tv writer. I'm drunk and I'm sorry my response isn't up to par...still a better ending than HIMYM"

HIMYM,3d18aa,randomasesino2012,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:28:30 2015 UTC,Money from this era worth more than the face value of the coin
HIMYM,3d18aa,TheLateOne,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:33:03 2015 UTC,Oh I know. The coins get tarnished and taken out of service leaving very few high quality examples after a decent amount of time.

HIMYM,3d22jo,VoirLaLumiere,4,Sun Jul 12 22:09:51 2015 UTC,"I personally prefer the actual ending. The ""Downtown Train"" cover to Ted and Tracy's meet-cute on the train platform is non-negotiable and can not be replaced.  On the other hand, I would prefer it if everything stayed as it was, just cutting it after Ted says, ""And that kids, is how I met your mother""."
HIMYM,3d22jo,misken67,7,Mon Jul 13 06:13:48 2015 UTC,The ending isn't the real problem. It's the journey to the ending that caused all of the suffering. Final season was a terrible build to a disappointing finish.
HIMYM,3d22jo,mikeramey1,3,Mon Jul 13 00:55:54 2015 UTC,"Personally I think its the opposite, I think a lot of the reason the real ending didnt work was the way the finale was done (meeting the mother and then Ted going for Robin being back to back) but it made sense with where the show came from and had been going."
HIMYM,3d22jo,BuzzHickey,2,Mon Jul 13 01:06:37 2015 UTC,"Alternate. But I didn't like neither. I didn't care about Tracy's death, but the divorce thing was awful and heartbreaking in a bad way. I watched the alternative with the hope of the divorce not happening, but they did it anyway."
HIMYM,3d22jo,theonewiththev,2,Mon Jul 13 20:35:10 2015 UTC,"At first I hated the actual ending, but then when I re-watched the series, I liked it. Don't get me wrong there were still things that bothered me to no end, and I still feel like there were major problems. Though I think the real problem was the choice to have the entire 9th season take place in one weekend. It made the finale feel way too rushed. My fantasy is that the wedding weekend goes until the mid-season finale where Barney and Robin get married, and then the future is played out in the second half of the season. I think they could have done a lot more and then our goodbye would have felt less abrupt."
HIMYM,3d22jo,gayjewtrombone,2,Tue Jul 14 00:44:00 2015 UTC,The real ending is much better.
HIMYM,3d22jo,rhcp88,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:25:14 2015 UTC,Loved the actual ending. Thought it was absolutely perfect.  (Although seasons 7-9 should have been condensed into one to make the lead-up less infuriating. Finale redeemed it for me.)
HIMYM,3d22jo,flutterfly28,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:28:25 2015 UTC,"I prefer the actual ending, it's consistent with the entire series. The alternate ending is cheesy and sappy, but I watch it occasionally just to feel happy when I'm feeling too sad about the original. Though I think they could have made the alternate ending much better if they had put more effort into it and made some dedicated scenes."
HIMYM,3d22jo,RusVir,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:36:27 2015 UTC,Alternate. I don't care what anyone says. I cared more about Tracy after knowing her for one season than I ever did for another character. To kill the best character in the show (Ranjit being a close second) seems unfair.
HIMYM,3d4eo7,noodle-flinger,10,Mon Jul 13 12:57:37 2015 UTC,Barney was lying. His initials are B.S. We saw Blauman in Sorry Bro S4 E16 and again in Jenkins S5 E13
HIMYM,3d4eo7,rose_tattoo,4,Mon Jul 13 13:26:29 2015 UTC,"Barney has a history of telling tall tales. Also, he was trying to do some kind of perverse 'scared straight' with Marshall saying that Marshall would die."
HIMYM,3d4eo7,djSexPanther,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:30:49 2015 UTC,"Adding to everything that has been said, it isn't even part of the story, Barney just makes it up when someone (Marshall, I think) asks if that's how it ends.  Also, search before you post."

HIMYM,3czov7,HughyHugh,41,Sun Jul 12 06:19:07 2015 UTC,"Ted would have gotten his girl, his wish come true. But then he would see Victoria and have second thoughts, but he would ignore her since he's with Robin. However after the wedding Robin would tell him that she doesn't want to date him (because she only realized she had feelings for Ted when she saw him with Victoria). This would make Ted try to find Victoria, but it would be impossible since he didn't meet her, so he doesn't know her name or that she made the cake. Ted would then get together with Robin in Nothing good happens after 2 AM since he would not be cheating on anyone now. They would have the same relationship that ends at the end of Season 2.  Years later Ted sees Victoria in Season 7 at the Architect's Ball and talks to her, only to learn that she is engaged. They meet again later in Season 8 or maybe at Barney and Robin's wedding where, by a turn of events, she happens to be the caterer! She tells him that she was left at the altar and Ted shares his similar experience. They both bond over this and talk about their lives and search for love and how they couldn't get together in their previous encounters. Finally Ted asks her out. Victoria is the Mother."
HIMYM,3czov7,RusVir,2,Sun Jul 12 11:42:16 2015 UTC,"Only problem is Victoria wasn't enough to make Ted forget about Robin. Victoria would eventually resent Robin the same way she did before, even if there's no ""cheating"" involved in their history, sensing the What If spark between the two or them. Now Ted has no kids, barring some magical scenario where he meets Tracy in this timeline."
HIMYM,3czov7,gizmo1492,2,Sun Jul 12 19:50:35 2015 UTC,"But in this case Ted meets Victoria in the Finale, after he has already let go of Robin for good and Robin is married to Barney. So she shouldn't have much reason to resent Robin. Maybe later, in 2020 when Robin is divorced and pining for Ted and they have that weird restaurant moment (deleted scene), Victoria might start to feel insecure if she finds out, but by that time they would probably be married with kids so Ted isn't going to leave her."
HIMYM,3czov7,RusVir,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:25:09 2015 UTC,Ted reconsidering his relationship with Robin because he saw a pretty girl across the room seems kinda crazy yknow.
HIMYM,3czov7,BuzzHickey,3,Mon Jul 13 01:08:41 2015 UTC,Robin did go to the wedding after she finished. Do you mean go with Ted as his date?  EDIT: down voted for asking a question? That's cold

HIMYM,3czov7,Domyfranky,3,Sun Jul 12 13:04:46 2015 UTC,"Probalby they would have ended up together,just a few months earlier than how it actually happened. I don't think it would have changed so much,they would have broken up a year later anyway. The only change would have been that he would have never met Victoria,but she wasn't fundamental in the overall story."
HIMYM,3czov7,steelbubble,10,Sun Jul 12 09:34:10 2015 UTC,"We call that one the ""butterfly effect"""
HIMYM,3czov7,GetMoneySmokeWeed,2,Sun Jul 12 10:43:24 2015 UTC,"He never would have gotten the tattoo if he and Victoria never met. Ted and Robin would have got together earlier, Lily would have broken them up earlier, Ted never would have met Amy (the woman who convinced him to get the tat,) then he never would of met Stella, then he never would have been hit by a car, then Barney would have never been hit by a bus, then he and Ted never would have become bros again, Robin and Barney never would have married, and Ted would never even meet Tracy once. Well, he would have taken her umbrella but then she'd never get it back.  Victoria wasn't fundamental to the overall story?"
HIMYM,3czov7,rose_tattoo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:17:41 2015 UTC,I don't understand that logic. Ted hooked up with Amy because he was upset with his break up with Robin and with Robin and Gael. Victoria had nothing to do with any of that. She was long gone by then
HIMYM,3czov7,GetMoneySmokeWeed,3,Sun Jul 12 11:17:51 2015 UTC,"But what I'm saying is, they would have broken up months before that night. What are the odds that Amy was also there that night and hooked up with Ted by doing the exact same things? Impossible, that's what.  Not to mention the tattoo artist, Ed was his name? Either way, he was dating Amy, presumably the months/weeks leading up to that night, so again it wouldn't of happened."
HIMYM,3czov7,rose_tattoo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:28:48 2015 UTC,"He wasn't dating Amy , it was a one night hookup. Gael was the reason that Ted got upset, so what would be the odds that Robin would meet him again?  Impossible."
HIMYM,3czov7,GetMoneySmokeWeed,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:23:45 2015 UTC,"I literally said ""What are the odds that Amy was also there that night and hooked up with Ted"" I never once said they dated. Even so, and yeah Gael is the reason, but what I said still holds true, if Ted and Robin went to that wedding together, then Ted never would have met Tracy. But as shown in the ""Lucky Penny"" we saw that one tiny little thing in your life such as picking up a penny on the ground can have such a huge impact on the course of life. There are billions of things that if they never happen then Ted and Tracy never would have met."

It seems to me that Barney (unconsciously) kept himself in a childlike state (tantrums, laser-tag), as if he stopped aging at the moment when his father left.  I think he (subconsciously) hoped to regain his father's affections that way.     The irony is that paternal love has two points of access: the child and the parent.  Barney finally gains access to paternal love -- the love of his life! -- when, at last, he becomes a father.  His (unconscious) dream came true.     Edit: wow, this post has swung from +2 to -2 and back again!  I wish that I could see demographics on the voting."

HIMYM,3cadou,niftyjimmymack,8,Mon Jul 6 10:27:13 2015 UTC,"The whole series was great.  Of course the show declined slightly in quality near the end, but hardly.  9 years is a long time for any show to stay on the air and I think they did very well with it considering that."
HIMYM,3cadou,rhcp88,5,Mon Jul 6 15:37:13 2015 UTC,"I loved the show. There where good jokes and bad ones, no show is perfect. Some storylines where touching and heartfelt, and others were tacky and forced but still very enjoyable. The only thing i really disliked about the ending was not that the mother died (even though i would have prefered if she stayed alive), it was the fact that we had a whole ninth season focused on the wedding of Barney and Robin only for them to get divorced in the first ten minutes of the finale."
HIMYM,3cadou,SaturnApollo34,5,Mon Jul 6 21:01:15 2015 UTC,"I didn't have a problem with the ending, just the way they handled it. They spent 95% of the season on barney & robins wedding just to get divorced the next episode. Then crammed multiple years in the span of 2 hours. It felt rushed and there was no time to process and let any of the events sink in. They should have spent around 4-5 episodes on the wedding & the remaining episodes on the 20+ years that were crammed in the last two."
HIMYM,3cadou,LAUNCHERMONKEY,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:24:13 2015 UTC,Hmm yes that would of been a much better idea tbh
HIMYM,3cadou,SamK2323,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:26:50 2015 UTC,That was exactly my issue. The pacing was just horrible. If we had less time with Marshall driving a random car and Robin and Barney's mom fighting over scrambled eggs and more time on developing Ted and The Mother (can't even remember her name) as a couple then it would have been much better.
HIMYM,3cadou,AdaAstra,2,Sat Jul 11 11:48:29 2015 UTC,"I'm one of those rare ones that enjoyed the original ending.  If the show did end up with Barney and Robin staying together, I wouldn't have minded but it wouldn't have made sense to me.   As the entire time the show is going on, he is telling the story through his eyes and doing a poor job at showing that he has gotten over Robin.  Barney marrying Robin and him meeting the mother on the same day, essentially was the final nail in the coffin of anything happening with Robin (in his eyes at least). After the mother passes, his feelings for Robin resurface.  However, now he his battling his love of the mother and feeling guilt for considering moving on.  Ted, being the romantic at heart and seeing evidence of his love for Tracy in his kids, decides he can't love another woman anymore. This whole story was him trying to come to terms with him loving the mother, and why he could not love Robin.  His kids calling him out and saying it was time to move on, was his final ""wake up"" moment that he could love another woman again.  Either way, I can't fault people for not liking the ending, but I loved it and no one is going to change my thoughts on the ending.  One of my favorite series and I re watch it regularly."
HIMYM,3cadou,namesareforsinners,2,Tue Jul 7 22:13:42 2015 UTC,"I agree a 100%, how you just described it is how I felt about the ending. I always loved Robin and ted togeather, I just honestly thought that throughout the show neither ted or Robin where ready for each other. I lived tracy and honestly wish we had more of her and I'm glad she could give ted everything he wanted in a family. The kids where right he wasn't telling them the story of how he meet there mother it felt more like a story about much he loved Robin,  which he used go tell gomself he couldn't love her "" because they never worked"". Glad they have him permission in the end."

What was the one thing that changes Barney's life?  Having a child, which Robin was incapable of giving him.  When would Ted and Robin be able to finally work as a couple?

HIMYM,3bzp69,destiny24,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:41:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's necessarily true or exactly what /u/redpythongoon was saying. I think what s/he is referring to about timing being important is that the type of person that you fall in love with becomes different over time as you grow and change as an individual. Someone may be right for you and seem like ""the one"" at one stage in your life, but not another. Once you enter into a happy, committed relationship though, hopefully you change together as you get older and share experiences, so timing becomes less of an issue as it is when you're single.  Also, I think that most, but not all, people marry someone that they love. It's just that unlike what the fairy tales have told us, love is not the only answer to a happy relationship. It's very possible to be crazy in love and marry someone who is wrong for you. Factors like compatibility, chemistry, communication, sharing an outlook in life, and commitment to each other are equally important and are sometimes overlooked in favor of love (and yes, for some people because they want to be married by a certain time and their significant other seems good enough). When any of those areas are lacking, then it's more likely that you'll fall out of love or be derailed as a couple by life's ups and downs."

HIMYM,3bzp69,Kiiochii,3,Fri Jul 3 17:06:33 2015 UTC,"I can see where you're coming from, but something about leaving it up in the air seemed to fit for me.

I personally think she should've been the one that got away."
HIMYM,3bzp69,Oatmeal_Addict,2,Fri Jul 3 21:44:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree with you, if she just disappeared after his cheating I would thought that too, considering Victoria was created as the mother just in case the series ended too soon we could see Victoria as Max. I could accept either way really.   But they did a lot of closures in the series, Scott and Lily before marrying Marshall , Stella and her ex husband, Robin and Ted before marrying Stella, Ted and Robin before marrying Barney, Barney and the playbook. It would have been too long to make a - Victoria and Ted before marrying Tracy - I guess..   Maybe they thought Ted losing Victoria (in the Tracy -  Max way) was too hard because he would eventually lose Tracy too, then people would be even more mad because he goes after Robin instead of Victoria, the ex-mother. I think they wanted Tracy and Ted life even (the couple already have nearly everything in common in an unreal way) I know not everyone will agree on this but I always felt like the comparisons are :   Max to Tracy = Tracy to Ted (the one each felt was perfect), Louis to Tracy = Victoria to Ted (the almost but not enough), Ted to Tracy = Robin to Ted (the one after losing the one).   My brother told me ""It's nice that she had the opportunity to fall in love with Louis and thanks to him she chose to free herself from Max. They (creators) didn't  throw her into his (Ted) arms completely recovered after been alone all this years""   So comparing Victoria and Louis may be unfair but in the few minutes I saw Louis, he was a sweetheart to Tracy and loved her but she seemed harsh and unhappy with him mainly because she was still dealing with Max death. Louis and Victoria ended up heartbroken.   I'm just assuming the comparisons to understand why they didn't throw another woman instead of Victoria. I still think the main reason was to give him a closure and show to the audience that even with good timing they weren't meant each other =)"

HIMYM,3c1gpc,Mark_Zajac,3,Sat Jul 4 14:14:59 2015 UTC,"again in love with Ted   Again?  My point is that Robin was never completely out of love with Ted.  To me, your surprise and outrage is unjustified.     Here is a repost of my take on Barney.  In retrospect, Barney was written with total consistency.  Fatherhood, not Robin, was the ending that Barney deserved, and (secretly) wanted, all along!     In the English language, “love” is an over-loaded word.  Wisely, the ancient Greeks had four different words: “eros” (carnal love), “philia” (brotherly love), ""storge"" (parental love) and “agapé” (abiding love).  Barney self-medicates with eros and philia but, throughout series, his heart is set on storge.     Barney is fixated on parental love.  He tries to seduce Ted’s mother, repeatedly.  When Robin calls for help with her locket, Barney dallies to play laser-tag with her father, choosing storge over Robin.  On the eve of his wedding, Barney is still obsessed with reuniting his parents.  Ostensibly, “The Lighthouse” reveals that Barney accepts Robin’s infertility but in the “scrambled egg” contest, Barney and (pregnant) Lilly both side with Loretta.  Her eggs are the best; she has storge to give, even a motherly hug for Robin.     With laser-tag and tantrums, Barney keeps himself in a childlike state, to stay elligible for storge.  He has a playbook, involving dress-up,  and he childishly begs people to play along: ""Just... OK? Just…”  He is a child, something Robin never wanted, as those who dislike her with Ted always carp.  The irony is that storge has two points of access: the child and the parent.  Barney attains storge — the love of his life! — through fatherhood, something that Robin can never give him."
HIMYM,3c1gpc,Domyfranky,0,Sat Jul 4 14:31:54 2015 UTC,"""something that Robin can never give him.""  And this is another reason why the ending is a big insult to all the B/R shippers,and has also a mysoginistic tone.   Anyway,if they really wanted us to believe that Robin was still in love with Ted all this time,they did a very bad work of storytelling. In fact,all the people who watched the show at that time had the impression that Ted was going insane with his ""love"" unrequited for Robin,and only wanted to see him to move on. Wow,what a great romance to root for."
HIMYM,3c1gpc,Mark_Zajac,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:02:09 2015 UTC,mysoginistic tone   Infertility can affect both men and women.  Suggesting that infertility might put stress on a relationship  does not in any way suggest misogyny (hatred of women).
HIMYM,3c1gpc,Domyfranky,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:38:53 2015 UTC,"in love with him for at least 7 seasons   Seven?  You make it sound like they were together this whole time.  Not so.      First, we saw in ""The Goat"" that Robin regretted her tryst with Barney.  It was not 'till ""Miracles"" that her feelings for Barney were more positive.  That was the very end of the third season.  That puts Robin and Barney together for six seasons, at the absolute most, not the seven that you claim.      Second, during those six seasons, Robin chose Don over Barney, in ""Twin Beds"" then chose Kevin over Barney in ""Tick Tick Tick"" and in ""The Rough Patch"" she chose to be single, over Barney.      Things were always tumultuous, with a mixture of good and bad moments.  It's not like Barney and Robin had seven blissful years that inexplicably led to divorce."
HIMYM,3c1gpc,Mark_Zajac,0,Sat Jul 4 15:16:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think you know the series very well...she wasn't in a relationship with him,but she was always in love with him,it was evident. She was over Ted since season 3,and look,Ted was over Robin too until season 7! Then,suddendly,Carter ""Nice Guy tm"" Bays remembered ""Oh,i have to kill Ted's love life and make Ted and Robin together because in this way i can get revenge of the girl who rejected me back in collegeh! i have to insert again Ted's love for Robin!"" and suddendly we had Victoria who said that Ted was in love with Robin (and i remember a lot of people that,when that episode aired,said ""wtf? the return of Ted/Robin? after all these years?"" because it really came out of nowhere,Ted was completely over Robin) and Ted saying ""i love you"" to her in ""No Pressure""...what a bad writers,guys...i can't believe it."

The trope is called Tough Room and HIMYM is actually notable for avoiding it.   Averted because the creators hate this trope. Any time a character is intentionally telling a joke, the actor playing the character telling the joke will be the only actor in the scene who's been told the joke beforehand. This ensures that the rest of the characters will laugh, or at least smirk, at the joke because the rest of the actors haven't heard it before."

HIMYM,3bohe2,Mark_Zajac,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:24:12 2015 UTC,"Here is a point that would not fit in my initial post.  I have already claimed that Fermina Daza, Juvenal Urbino and Miss Barbra Lynch are doppelgängers for Robin, Barney and Nora, respectively.  Upon reflection, Miss Barbra Lynch has a second doppelgänger: Kevin.  Among principle characters of european descent, Nora, Kevin and Miss Barbra Lynch are all conspicuous exceptions.  Urbino is married to Farmina when he has an affair with Miss Barbra Lynch.  With slight reversal, Barney and Robin cheat on Nora and Kevin, respectively.  Urbino is a doctor and Miss Barbra Lynch is his patient.  Kevin is a doctor and Robin is his patient.     Is this next point a stretch?  Miss Barbara Lynch is always Miss Barbra Lynch or Miss Lynch, never Barbara.  No last name for Nora is ever given, which is odd, though not unprecedented for a recurring HIMYM love-interest."
HIMYM,3bnz7e,fededm97,9,Tue Jun 30 19:13:30 2015 UTC,"From start to finish, I'd day that ""Nothing Good Happens After 2:00 AM"" is my absolute favorite episode.  I like how it starts and ends with Robin brushing her teeth, contrasting tumultuous heartbreak with mundane, day-to-day routine.  Sometimes, all you can do is just keep breathing.     The accumulation of little frustrations that gradually wore Robin down were extremely relatable -- we've all been there.  It rang so true when Robin named Ted as the only person with whom she wanted to share all the ups and downs of her day -- that sentiment spanned the arc of their friendship.   Years later, thought slightly angry with Ted, Robin echoes that sentiment in ""The Broath"" when she describes Ted as ""the one person I want to talk to most.""     The heartbreak as Ted and Robin each went to sleep alone was palpable.  To me, this was not an episode of television; it was a 30 minute film.     In terms of favorite scenes, the two minute date in ""Ten Sessions"" is spectacular.  The light-show from ""Symphony of Illumination"" always clenches my gut.  The cab ride from the airport in ""No Pressure"" is enchanting; when you have true affection for a person, you want to tell them all the mundane trivia of your day and, if that person reciprocates, then they want to hear every boring detail.      The last scene of the finalé was a dream come true."

HIMYM,3bitn8,lawre179,50,Tue Jun 30 12:34:11 2015 UTC,"I'd say Marshall's flaw was his perceived perfection.  He lived in this dream world and wasn't fully present in the real world.

HIMYM,3bitn8,Philofelinist,21,Mon Jun 29 17:16:31 2015 UTC,"Tongue-in-cheek fanboyism aside, I'll bite :P  I think he and Ted shared this trait, to a certain extent; but where Ted was arrogant, delusional, and at worst, self-defeating, Marshall was more or less confident and optimistic, if not to a fault.    Every character handled conflict and stress pathologically; Ted would internalize and wallow in self-pity, Lily would run away (sometimes literally) and hide from her problems, Robin would project on others, and Barney... well, was Barney, but I think Marshall would at least try to rationalize his emotional turmoil.  You're right in a way, but I still would argue he had the healthiest approach to conflict out of the group."
HIMYM,3bitn8,Mixcoatll,6,Mon Jun 29 19:33:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I also think he's a bit too conservative. He loved Lily but she was feisty but made her into the dutiful housewife. Not saying she didn't accomplish some of her goals but the show put Marshall's first and in a more positive light. He often acted like he just found himself in situations without really admitting that he wanted to do them, like the jobs and whatnot."
HIMYM,3bitn8,TheGuyYouKnowThatGuy,4,Tue Jun 30 11:23:40 2015 UTC,Did you not see him coach basketball? Life is unfair and that there are losers was his mantra. He fought hard with his brothers growing up. He isn't a poofy little fairy tale guy.
HIMYM,3bitn8,theblackfool,17,Tue Jun 30 12:35:09 2015 UTC,"What's funny to me is that Marshall is basically universally lauded as the best character when it comes to judging them as a person, but if you did the same thing for the actual actors, Jason Segel would probably come in 5th out of 5 based on his antics in the last season or two while NPH and Alyson are universally loved.  I'd argue the rankings would basically be flipped.  I wonder if Jason Segel the man gets a lot of positive vibes purely based on his role as lovable Marshall.  By the way, I'm not saying JS is a bad person, just that a lot of people would probably hold it against him that he was really the only main actor who contemplated quitting early and then basically mailed it in at the end."
HIMYM,3bitn8,TheGuyYouKnowThatGuy,22,Mon Jun 29 19:14:17 2015 UTC,"Well for the record, the last season was hot garbage, and it's not really his fault he didn't want to do it anymore. He's talked about it, and how he doesn't like how the character just turned into an exaggerated version of himself from previous seasons. I don't think he was ever overly disrespectful about it, he just didn't want to do it.  JS seemingly likes really putting his heart into projects, and just didn't have interest in it anymore."
HIMYM,3bitn8,theblackfool,15,Mon Jun 29 19:20:32 2015 UTC,"To be fair though, that's JS putting the best spin on it possible.  I think it's fair to say that a big part of the reason his role in Season 9 sucked was that he spent most of it in a car, filming separately from the rest of the cast.  I have a hard time believing that was a writing choice.  More likely, he was on the fence about coming back at all and preferred to work on different projects, but the show convinced him to come back in part by offering him a version of his role that required less of his time so he could go do those other things.  So to the extent that Season 9 sucked, at least some small portion of that is attributable to JS."
HIMYM,3bitn8,Eshajori,3,Mon Jun 29 21:35:50 2015 UTC,"Right, but what I'm saying is you can't really blame him for not wanting to come back. He's put 8 years into it and his contract was up. He's allowed to want to move on and do other things."
HIMYM,3bitn8,Mark_Zajac,3,Tue Jun 30 09:25:01 2015 UTC,"he doesn't like how the character just turned into an exaggerated version of himself from previous seasons   This is commonly referred to as Flanderization, and honestly it was a lot worse in the 3rd quarter of the show than it was in the final season.  Ted had degraded to Pathetic-Love-Moron, Lilly was Tisk Tisk girl, Robin was Suzie Unstable, Barney was Zany-Sex-Guy and Marshal was Mr. Kindblivious. All of which had been important yet realistic facets of their character, blended with many human traits and problems.  I'd say the worst of this was somewhere around Season 5 or 6. By the last season they'd almost completely recovered."
HIMYM,3bitn8,TheGuyYouKnowThatGuy,3,Mon Jun 29 22:22:56 2015 UTC,"I had feared that ""The Muppets"" would be a crass, corporate cash-grab.  To me, Jason Segel defied the greedy corporations and infused that movie with child-like innocence, in a very Marshall-esqe way."
HIMYM,3bitn8,ristoman,3,Wed Jul 1 14:49:57 2015 UTC,"I know I sounded like I was dumping on Segel, and I sort of was, but that's not really fair as I actually have a very high opinion of him as an actor and a writer.  I think he's got a real gift of vision for these projects, and I think the fact that he's so self-aware is really his great comedic gift.  He was right about the last season of HIMYM: we all agree that the show probably lasted too long.  The only thing I didn't love was that it was basically known that the show wasn't going to go 12 seasons and that season 8 or 9 was it, and I think he allowed his desire to go do other stuff to override his professionalism of finishing the HIMYM project well, especially given that the sitcom is what brought him to the masses and allowed him the trust from studios to do these other projects.  I love Jason Segel, but it does bum me out that he let his desire to do new things kind of kill his joy for the HIMYM show.  By comparison, NPH seems to have really enjoyed every moment, found time for other projects, and he's given his all to everything he's done.  I'm impressed with his motor that doesn't stop, and his professionalism to try to crush everything he says ""yes"" to doing."

HIMYM,3bitn8,Hellmark,2,Tue Jun 30 00:45:32 2015 UTC,"This is true. But IASIP and Seinfeld pride themselves on not building toward anything, just routine and gimmicks. HIMYM had a goal from the start, heck its in the title. What bothers me is not that many of the characters have flaws, its that there character arc seems to dissolve in the final season/two episodes. Ted, Robin, and Barney seem to resort to their old selves except Barney has a kid now. I guess they were building towards these monumental arcs were Robin can be unselfish and learn to depend on others, Ted can stop being so uncertain, Barney was becoming less Barney, and Lily ...Lily was always Lily. Anyhow, theses arcs were never achieved and it seemed like the characters just settled, which is upsetting but probably a very realistic view of human nature and goal setting.  Marshall achieved his, but there was never any doubt. Right?"
HIMYM,3bitn8,Domyfranky,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:26:33 2015 UTC,"That's my complaint too. Character development goes out the window in the finale. Barney is the only one that sort of gains it back, when he sees his daughter for the first time."

HIMYM,3bjk28,yaitskov,15,Mon Jun 29 19:16:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they know who their mother is, but the way he introduces the story he doesn't necessarily explain whether it really is the mother or not which is also what created the mystery for the audience.  For example, when he first met Victoria, he never told the kids or us her name when they met at the wedding. After we find out the name, it just turns into Ted telling his kids a story about another girl."

HIMYM,3bi95a,callmethundercock,84,Mon Jun 29 14:07:30 2015 UTC,"IIRC, Alyson Hannigan was pregnant and needed a convenient way to skip a few episodes."
HIMYM,3bi95a,MamaCash,17,Mon Jun 29 14:15:28 2015 UTC,Yep. If you watch the eps before that one she is very obviously trying to hide a big bump. The break was set so she could have the baby with some time off. The next one she shows up in she's only there for like 30 seconds in the very end.
HIMYM,3bi95a,pburydoughgirl,7,Mon Jun 29 15:36:36 2015 UTC,"Robin, too, has an obvious bump. They gave birth 2 months apart.  I can't imagine being Cobie and having to go to the producers right after Allyson did. I'm in a similar situation at work right now myself."
HIMYM,3bi95a,BlakePlacid,-18,Mon Jun 29 20:02:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she needed the time off. But the way they wrote her off the episodes for that month was terrible and lazy. Just write it that she's at some art thing."

HIMYM,3bi95a,Indosay,4,Mon Jun 29 17:02:59 2015 UTC,I thought it was great.  My friend and I counted to make sure she was actually gone for the amount of time Future Ted said they didn't see her.  It was unique and I had never seen it done like that before.
HIMYM,3bi95a,MamaCash,3,Mon Jun 29 17:12:38 2015 UTC,"I think it may have been a last minute thing. She did an interview where she said she got really tired, really quickly and needed to get some bed rest. It did feel rushed, but it wasn't distractingly so."
HIMYM,3bi95a,Lov1ng,3,Mon Jun 29 17:53:20 2015 UTC,"I don't remember what episode it was, but in the episode where there is talk about resumes and how lily was a champion hot dog eater, at the end she breaks her previous personal record and throws her hands up, showing a sizeable belly. IIRC, this actually Alyson hanigans pregnant belly."
HIMYM,3bi95a,rbarton812,2,Mon Jun 29 23:53:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, a very funny bit.  Titus had a similar bit when their lead female got pregnant. Instead of writing her off, they just broke her character's leg and put her in a wheelchair."
HIMYM,3bi95a,soccerburn55,3,Sun Jul 5 12:17:39 2015 UTC,"Yes her and Colbie were both pregnant. You can play a fun drinking game with that season. If they hide a pregnant belly badly, like you can tell, take a drink."

HIMYM,3bl0hb,Purpurix,13,Tue Jun 30 02:08:44 2015 UTC,"What made me angry was that it turned into the Barney Stinson show; co-starring Robin Scherbatsky , featuring Lily and Marshall Eriksen with special appearances by Ted Mosby. Purely because Barney was the breakout character and they focused on him. He isn't the kind of character that should be focused on he was better as a side kick in small doses"
HIMYM,3bl0hb,rose_tattoo,-1,Tue Jun 30 10:43:14 2015 UTC,"When you have a talent like Neil Patrick Harris,you can't let him stay only like a side kick...and let's face it,Barney is a more interesting character than Ted,Tes is the most boring character in the group. Also,if it wasn't for Barney,i don't think that the show would have lasted more than 2-3 seasons."
HIMYM,3bl0hb,Domyfranky,4,Tue Jun 30 11:42:22 2015 UTC,"That's not the point, they should never have let his character overshadow the others. No wonder Jason Segel was bored."
HIMYM,3bl0hb,rose_tattoo,0,Tue Jun 30 12:49:07 2015 UTC,Well i don't think that Marshall's less importance it's Barney fault. I don't know if Jason would have liked to stay in a show lasted only 2-3 seasons where he was the main character (altough he was never at the centre of the show) or maybe he prefered to stay in a great success lasted 9 seasons with Barney as the main character.
HIMYM,3bl0hb,Domyfranky,3,Tue Jun 30 13:34:05 2015 UTC,"I think the quality of the jokes is always good,even in the latest seasons,and there is a good combination of comedy and drama (since season 6) but yes,the plot is a disaster,they spent 3 seasons building up the Barney/Robin wedding and then they destroy it in 20 minutes. And they made Ted seeming like a creepy stalker about Robin...in the first 2 seasons,they were cute together,but in the latest seasons that wasn't a healthy relationship anymore for Ted. People saw him depressed,and the only thing people wanted was to see Ted moving on...instead,they killed his wife and made him coming back to her."
HIMYM,3bkjc9,MangoMarx,5,Mon Jun 29 23:44:21 2015 UTC,"For me its Vesuvius all the way (S9E19)  I don't want to give away why, but its the scenes with Ted and the Mother that do it. I never noticed it on the first watch through, but the second time around Ted said one line towards the end of the episode and I instantly lost it.    For those who caught it, you know what I'm talking about."
HIMYM,3bkjc9,moffitts_prophets,9,Tue Jun 30 06:47:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but the saddest by far is the dead of Marshall's dad. Every time I hear ""What? My dads dead?...... I'm not ready for this..."" I just cry."

HIMYM,3bkjc9,AvsFanInSTL,2,Tue Jun 30 02:20:02 2015 UTC,That is a sad episode no matter which ending you pick (Tracy lives: it's sad because he was so lonely that night and he couldn't wait to meet her. If she dies: it's sad because he wanted those extra days with her.)

HIMYM,3bgyli,jelatinman,14,Mon Jun 29 03:22:04 2015 UTC,I didn't know people hated this episode. I actually have always loved it and think its one of the fourth season's best episodes.
HIMYM,3bgyli,samandwhatnot,8,Mon Jun 29 04:27:14 2015 UTC,come on who likes Karen. She was so not bourgeois
HIMYM,3bgyli,chochotrain65,3,Mon Jun 29 11:13:29 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it's just the constant manipulation of Lily's behavior that she was shown to have that episode which makes people dislike it, but I do think that if there was another reason for certain fans to dislike the episode, it's because this episode allowed Robin to openly keep Ted on her radar again. I mean, we know that from Ted and Stella's wedding along with the flashback to hiding the locket that she wanted Ted to be in her back pocket, but she was the one that instigated the 40 year promise. Plus, look at her face of disappointment when Ted suggested that maybe Ted/Robin still needed to figure out their own paths.   Personally, even though this episode kinda snipes Lily's character and defines her role as a manipulator, I rather like the episode."
HIMYM,3bgyli,gizmo1492,2,Mon Jun 29 05:38:02 2015 UTC,"I love Lily and felt that Ted blamed her for breaking up with him and Robin. I felt that Ted still had regret about him and Robin, despite his life with The Mother and subconsciously blamed Lily.  Lily cared about her friend enough to help him out. It would have been hard for her to see her friend make horrible mistakes despite all of them thinking that the relationships were wrong. And if relationships were broken up over minor things, then they were never good to begin with. I think her Front Porch test is so bittersweet and beautiful. Not saying her actions were good but the reasoning behind them were fine. I'd rather my friends interfere in my lovelife than see me get hurt.  Robin had Ted on her hook, awful of her."

HIMYM,3bgaq3,Webify,8,Sun Jun 28 23:38:59 2015 UTC,"Here is my take on Barney.  I never guessed but, in retrospect, Barney was written with total consistency.  Fatherhood, not Robin, was the ending that Barney deserved, and (secretly) wanted, all along!    In the English language, “love” is an over-loaded word.  Wisely, the ancient Greeks had four different words: “eros” (carnal love), “philia” (brotherly love), ""storge"" (parental love) and “agapé” (abiding love).  Barney self-medicates with eros and philia but, throughout series, his heart is set on storge.    Barney is fixated on parental love.  He tries to seduce Ted’s mother, repeatedly.  When Robin calls for help with her locket, Barney dallies to play laser-tag with her father, choosing storge over Robin.  On the eve of his wedding, Barney is still obsessed with reuniting his parents.  Ostensibly, “The Lighthouse” reveals that Barney accepts Robin’s infertility but in the “scrambled egg” contest, Barney and (pregnant) Lilly both side with Loretta.  Her eggs are the best; she has storge to give, even for Robin.    With laser-tag and tantrums, Barney keeps himself in a childlike state, to stay elligible for storge.  He has a playbook, involving dress-up,  and he childishly begs people to play along: ""Just... OK? Just…”  He is a child, something Robin never wanted, as those who dislike her with Ted always carp.  The irony is that storge has two points of access: the child and the parent.  Barney attains storge — the love of his life! — through fatherhood, something that Robin can never give him."
HIMYM,3bgaq3,Mark_Zajac,2,Tue Jun 30 23:27:45 2015 UTC,"I really do like this, I feel like Barney himself used sexual experiences as a way to deal with not knowing his father. For those who don't remember, in a scene where the trio are ""single"" in the first season (or second), Barney goes off to say something along the lines of ""wherever any women with daddy issues are, we'll be there"" (not a direct quote) in restrospect that women with daddy issues often use sex as a way to deal with it. I feel like Barney has also done that as a way to try and validate himself if he did ever meet his father, which is shown when he does meet him and is disappointed when his father isn't similar to himself.  As for the child, I think because of how he's dealt with his childhood and not having a father, the one thing he really does want is a child and he wants a child that he can solely look after. Sort of the opposite of his upbringing, to always be there for his child unlike his actual father was for him."
HIMYM,3bgaq3,Mark_Zajac,2,Wed Jul 1 08:45:18 2015 UTC,"""wherever any women with daddy issues are, we'll be there""   Barney echoes this in the ""Robot vs. Wrestlers"" scene from the finalé.  He laments missing his ""George Clooney"" years, in which younger women with daddy issues will flock to him.      It struck me as significant that Barney parted from Nora a the moment of meeting her parents -- almost a jealousy thing.  He went back to Robin, a kindred spirit with ""daddy issues"" of her own.  To me that was the basis for his attraction there.  He basically says this when Robin asks why he would chose to be with her."
HIMYM,3bgaq3,Mark_Zajac,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:24:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I legitimately feel like Barney's relationship to his father actively provoked his own instinct to try and seduce women such as himself. In some ways, I feel like his one night stands and playbooks, mistreating women essentially, is justified to himself due to him somewhat acknowledging his daddy issues and feeling that they will feel similar to him on one night stands.  I still feel like it was too sudden, but I agree with how they did it. Instead of having a season based on their wedding, I feel like they couold have taken an episode for each character (~5-6 episodes) as mini finales which explores the ending for each character instead of just killing the mother off, giving barney a kid and having ted/robin hook up. Again."
HIMYM,3bgaq3,XenlaMM9,2,Wed Jul 1 12:30:19 2015 UTC,"You wrote:   Barney himself used sexual experiences as a way to deal with not knowing his father.       I wrote:   Barney self-medicates with eros and philia but, throughout series, his heart is set on storge."

HIMYM,3bgaq3,postmalone,3,Wed Jul 1 12:35:11 2015 UTC,This is exactly how I felt. They reduced Barney to a total degenerate after developing so much and then the baby thing...with 31??? Didn't like it.

HIMYM,3bcebs,ThatOneChappy,110,Sat Jun 27 21:58:03 2015 UTC,The entire series is easier to follow if you just accept that the entire thing is told from Teds perspective and he has a tendency to exaggerate or possibly omit the details to make his point.

He never bothered to remember Carl's last name in a decade of patronage, not awful, but c'mon.

HIMYM,3bcebs,Poco585,32,Mon Jun 29 16:08:54 2015 UTC,Weird. I'm on my second round of the series post finale. Third round total. But I don't buy into the anti-finale hype.
HIMYM,3bcebs,CarbonCamaroZL1,2,Sun Jun 28 02:09:43 2015 UTC,"Same. I have watched the whole series with the exception of Season 9, about 5 times now. Not necessarily all in order, because I would watch on TV when it came on every day. But I have probably seen all of the episodes at least 5 times, with 3 full watch throughs.  Only reason I have only rewatched Season 9 twice is because I did one rewatch before Season 8 finished.  And the finale I believe worked out well as a story, but they really shouldn't have shown it the way they did. Whole season is about the wedding weekend, then dedicating a whole 2 episodes to meeting the mother, and everything afterwards. I wish the Wedding weekend was only like 4 episodes, then the rest of the season was things that happened after meeting the mother. Maybe more episodes about the mother's life before the wedding too."
HIMYM,3bcebs,Poco585,5,Sun Jun 28 02:39:32 2015 UTC,"I understand the wish for more episodes post meeting the mother, but I understand why there wasn't and I like how they did it. Ted's story was about how he met her, and so meeting her was the conclusion of that story. If he met her earlier on in the season then he rest of the show wouldn't really align with what the point of the show was in the first place. And I can't help but think I would start to get bored with it. Ted concluded the story of how he met their mother, then gave a brief description of what happened to the gang after that. I think that's how he would have done it."
HIMYM,3bcebs,Poco585,2,Sun Jun 28 02:48:01 2015 UTC,I don't even think the finale was shitty. I actually thought it was a pretty good ending.

HIMYM,3bcebs,rose_tattoo,18,Sun Jun 28 21:30:10 2015 UTC,"She made Marshall give up on his dream job 3 times! Once because he needed a job that paid more to pay for her spending addiction,   Wrong! Marshall took that job at the Amusement Park because he thought it would be fun and easy BEFORE he knew about Lily's debts.   one because he liked his corporate job and she just didn't like that,   She wanted Marshall to follow his dream of being an environmental lawyer.   and the third time is because she wanted to go to Italy...    She turned that job down twice because of his work. Marshall then begged the Captain to give Lily the job."
HIMYM,3bcebs,Amonette2012,3,Sun Jun 28 04:20:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Also when Marshall did get his dream job it ended up with him spending most of the time making excuses to do stupid shit with his boss.   Personally I like Lily because she's so uncompromising, and I think it's interesting that despite her own dark side, she's the moral compass of the group a lot of the time. Part of her meddling is down to her wanting the best for her friends and her motives are often good. For example she always knows when Robin is lying to herself about something, she always knows when Ted is about to do something really stupid - she's a mother hen, and that can be a bit annoying sometimes, but her heart is in the right place. Also to be fair, she does have to put up with a fair bit of crazy from Marshall. A lot of wives would not put up with some of the things he and Ted get up to. Jeez the guy shaved his hair off right before the wedding ceremony and accidentally stabbed her with a sword, it's not like she's married to Chris Pratt!"

HIMYM,3bcebs,radiowinner,6,Sun Jun 28 13:46:46 2015 UTC,I really stopped liking Robin after season 1. And man are you right. Season 8 she just turns into the worst person imaginable.
HIMYM,3bcebs,Mahojo,4,Sun Jun 28 23:29:35 2015 UTC,Even in season 1 she plays with Ted's heart so much :/
HIMYM,3bcebs,Amonette2012,4,Sun Jun 28 03:33:30 2015 UTC,I think he overwhelmed her a bit. She's clearly not used to the kind of closeness Ted is capable of and he tells her he loves her on the first date. It's kind of amazing she didn't just run. I think I'd have a similar reaction to a guy being that full on!
HIMYM,3bcebs,radiowinner,2,Sun Jun 28 05:25:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly though. I never even thought she was that funny either. I feel as though her only point in this show was to present a roadblock for Ted throughout his life. Please, just leave the guy alone and let him live his life."
HIMYM,3bcebs,Tomtrocity,7,Sun Jun 28 13:40:12 2015 UTC,"I found towards the end Lilly was the worst character, but had the best character development out of all the characters. Most of the characters to me remained the same as the show goes on, but Lilly is not at all the same as she was in season 1 or 2. The main thing i hate  the most that Robin did was leave Ted out of her thank you at the speech she gave when she got an award in season 1 when Ted thinks he brought a prostitute."
HIMYM,3bcebs,alexlistens,38,Sun Jun 28 16:37:45 2015 UTC,"IMO, Ted was the worst person in the main crew. He cheated on women like crazy and had no real conscious once he felt lust towards anyone. The fact that he had to ask all his friends for advice, and then blatantly ignored it anyways, just shows what kind of person he really was.   Marshall and Lily were my personal favourites."
HIMYM,3bcebs,Disgruntled_Fridge,38,Sun Jun 28 13:50:55 2015 UTC,He cheated on women like crazy   Once. He cheated once.

HIMYM,3bcebs,rose_tattoo,8,Sun Jun 28 00:31:53 2015 UTC,Besides Victoria who did Ted cheat on?
HIMYM,3bcebs,TheRealDJ,8,Sun Jun 28 03:56:31 2015 UTC,"Did he actually cheat on victoria? He definitely was about to attempt to cheat on her, but got called on it before it happened."
HIMYM,3bcebs,rose_tattoo,7,Sun Jun 28 13:39:30 2015 UTC,Technically no he didn't. He did lie to Robin about them breaking up so it was his intention
HIMYM,3bcebs,azizinator25,3,Sun Jun 28 03:35:18 2015 UTC,"I mean, Ted and Robin made out while Ted was still dating Victoria. I'd say that counts as cheating. I would guess most people aren't cool with their SOs making out with other people."
HIMYM,3bcebs,alexlistens,12,Sun Jun 28 08:27:46 2015 UTC,Even he becomes a scum bag eventually. He got Victoria to leave a dude at the altar and then left her for Robin.  I like dirt bag characters but when a show tries to make you sympathize and root for them it makes no sense.
HIMYM,3bcebs,TheRealDJ,16,Sun Jun 28 08:35:48 2015 UTC,"You're right. That's why Breaking Bad was so good to me. Walter played an important role, but you didn't need for him to get what he wanted."

HIMYM,3bcebs,Disgruntled_Fridge,8,Sun Jun 28 00:58:58 2015 UTC,How did he get Victoria to leave Klaus? All he did was ask if Victoria was doing anything later on. He had no idea she was getting married. Victoria was the one who ran away (and Klaus)
HIMYM,3bcebs,Sakheteu,4,Sun Jun 28 01:05:25 2015 UTC,"The one who ran away and he ran away with her. At first when he was about to return her to the altar, that seemed like great character growth for Ted. Klaus leaving doesn't really matter since they had no way of knowing back then."
HIMYM,3bcebs,Amonette2012,5,Sun Jun 28 03:09:06 2015 UTC,"He got Victoria to leave a dude at the altar   He didn't get Victoria to leave Klaus. Victoria clearly wanted to leave Klaus, and Klaus didn't want to marry her either. Ted's hands are mostly clean in this incident.   then left her for Robin.   Also not true. She asked him to stop being friends with Robin, which he couldn't do. It was a reasonable request by Victoria given their history, but Ted isn't a dick because he couldn't do it."
HIMYM,3bcebs,Dondarian,2,Sun Jun 28 03:38:00 2015 UTC,"But the way she did it, how is that right exactly? he agrees to leave with her, how are his hands clean in that situation?  Its a dick move because she left back alot of things to get Ted. She even says when a girl leaves a person for another at the altar, she's madly in love with that person, and he still chooses Robin. Although ultimately you can kind of justify this one to go both ways."
HIMYM,3bcebs,alexlistens,3,Sun Jun 28 03:57:39 2015 UTC,"He didn't leave her for Robin, she wanted him to never see someone, who he concidered basicly family, ever again. He couldn't do that and she left."

HIMYM,3bcebs,bebito79,3,Sun Jun 28 17:28:05 2015 UTC,"My main issue with Robin is they wrote her completely inconsistently -- her personality changed in order to accommodate the plot, rather than the plot being affected by her characterization, which made her by far the weakest and most WTF of the gang."

HIMYM,3bcebs,MangoMarx,2,Sun Jun 28 00:17:34 2015 UTC,"One of the things I like about this show is that the people aren't perfect little caricatures. They have bad sides, they don't always do the right thing, and that gives them more depth. I empathize with Robin in many ways because I suppose my life situation is closest to hers - I'm also a child free career driven woman who tends to be mean without really meaning to sometimes, so from my perspective it's nice to see a character I can relate to in the show even if she isn't the nicest person on it.   I guess what I'm saying is that the character's dark sides - Lily's selfishness, Marshall's irresponsibility, Barney's tendency to treat women really badly and Ted's self obsession and shallowness all serve to make the cast much more real than if they were all a bunch of one dimensional goody goodies."
HIMYM,3bcebs,Amonette2012,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:11:07 2015 UTC,"That's not the problem. The show tries to make you sympathize with those people, tries to make you root for them and be happy for them. In the case of Robin, I felt none of those because she was such a knobhead.  As someone pointed out in this thread, Breaking Bad has Walter White as a protagonist, one of the biggest assholes on TV, but it works because the show acknowledges this and doesn't try and make you root for them or sympathize."
HIMYM,3bcebs,PowayMermaid,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:37:03 2015 UTC,"I guess that's a fair point, although I think it tries to get you to sympathize with them despite their bad points rather than trying to make out that they don't have any."

The group would have probably disbanded, a lot of their quality time together is when they are as a 5, and Robin brings something that the group didn't have and that's somebody Lily can, as a woman, relate to. We haven't really seen in the show the friends they all have outside of the group, they have some, but none to the same extent or even close AS the group. Just from that alone, i'd bet it'd be difficult for Lily if Robin didn't join.  As for the show, which obviously couldn't have gone on, if the slip didn't happen and the events happened similarly, it would have been a worse show. The initial ""I think i'm in love with you"" opens the audience up to Ted. Ted does dumb shit, he says ""I love you"" way too quickly, ends up heartbroken etc.   Without the initial ""I think i'm in love with you"" we wouldn't have been opened up to Ted's relationship habits, which is a fundamental part of the show."

When Lily needed a ride to get the six pack, Ranjit risked his profession to help her with such a small but special routine of the Erikson's, and he knew she was supposed to have one.   He was at Barney and Robins wedding, and whenever he was needed he helped. If that doesn't make him at some level part of the gang, I don't know what does."

Barney picks up Ted to take him to the party and Ted reveals that he knows that Barney and Robin had sex. Ranjit is driving the limo, rolls down the window to the back and scolds Barney in English for sleeping with Robin. Then in Farsi he says a bunch of shit.  First were three words that my friend didn't understand. She assumed they were curses that her parents never taught her. Then he says something along the lines of, ""I can't believe you would do that."" And then he starts saying something about what would happen if anyone did that in his homeland but it cuts off because he rolls the window back up. Ranjit was pissed at Barney."

Lily on the other hand is definitely a bitch. She is manipulative toward other people's relationships and handles stress by spending money she and her husband don't have. Destructive spending is one thing when it's yourself, but when you have a family you need to get your act together. She can be compassionate when she needs to be but overall I would not want to be her friend."

(IMO, if they didn't drag the show on so long, Ted wouldn't seem as whiney. Because as I see it, the first few seasons are largely about Ted and his romantic journey, but then the writers wanted to squeeze as much from the show as possible, so they focused a lot more on other people in the show for the later seasons. All the while Ted didn't have much going on (because if he found his girl the show would be over), which—I feel—causes some people to find him more whiney and annoying, but I certainly can't blame him. If anything, I can relate to him more than any other character.)  Edit: Word Choice"
HIMYM,3aytvk,jonath_n,4,Thu Jun 25 00:53:39 2015 UTC,"Robin had her moments, loved it when she would talk ""Canadian""   As a Canadian, they did this well. There was a scene in the first or second season where Robin speaks Canadian and the show had ""American"" subtitles. It was perfect because I didn't need them, and it really wasn't a stretch what she was saying.  I love her purely for the Canadian angle. I have to praise HIMYM for that, they did that so well. Typically American shows take insulting jabs at Canada, or ignorant jokes. Such as a Simpsons episode where they call Canada ""American Jr."" which goes to show how ignorant the shows creators are. Or in Cheers, when Cliff's girlfriend moves to Canada, she comes back and suddenly has a southern US accent.. What? we don't even remotely speak like that.  Or there was an X-men cartoon where Wolverine (A Canadian) speaks with an Aussie Accent. (ugh)."

HIMYM,3aytvk,MrTimmannen,5,Thu Jun 25 10:43:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly I hated Ted in the beginning because he was a straight psycho with his whole ""I love you"" to Robin on the first date, but he really grew on me."
HIMYM,3aytvk,MissRepresentation,9,Thu Jun 25 00:06:56 2015 UTC,"I can see why that would garner him hate, but I loved him for it.  That firmly established him as the hopeless romantic guy who is looking for the one.  He was thinking it was a love at first sight type thing, whereas Robin had a more grounded view on the whole encounter."

HIMYM,3aytvk,theblackfool,47,Wed Jun 24 18:52:01 2015 UTC,"I dislike Lily and Robin. I never liked Robin again after she fucked Barney over by not dumping Kevin like she said.  I love Ted. He's whiny, but overall a good guy. I also love Marshall.  It's hard to have feelings either way towards Barney. He's endearing, but kind of an asshole. That being said, Barney is such an unrealistic character, it's hard to argue either side.  Also, Gary Blaumann..... I LOVE that guy!"

HIMYM,3aytvk,masternarf,11,Wed Jun 24 19:41:29 2015 UTC,I am actively looking for my Marshal. If I find him I will marry him immediately. And why do we hate lily again?
HIMYM,3aytvk,rocklikeastone,5,Wed Jun 24 22:02:53 2015 UTC,My friend says I remind her of Marshall.
HIMYM,3aytvk,StayPuffGoomba,7,Wed Jun 24 22:33:43 2015 UTC,You live in FL?
HIMYM,3aytvk,rocklikeastone,2,Wed Jun 24 22:35:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I dont live in Florida, and my friend is married. But maybe she was just trying to reassure me im not Ted."
HIMYM,3aytvk,StayPuffGoomba,3,Wed Jun 24 22:41:39 2015 UTC,"Feel you. I'm not quite a female Ted, maybe a bit more Robin."
HIMYM,3aytvk,rocklikeastone,2,Thu Jun 25 01:27:45 2015 UTC,"Dude, Robin is awesome! Id totally date Robin. Well, as long as she kinda doesnt have all the relationship issues."

HIMYM,3aytvk,rocklikeastone,2,Thu Jun 25 02:17:36 2015 UTC,"Also, she has a crush on you"
HIMYM,3aytvk,rocklikeastone,3,Wed Jun 24 22:36:10 2015 UTC,"What is there to like about her? She manipulates the important relationships of her closest friends, finds herself in massive debt and lies to Marshall about it, steals valuable items from people to teach attempt to teach them a lesson, leaves Marshall for some absurd pursuit in San Francisco and then expects to get him back after that utterly fails. And that's just off the top of my head."
HIMYM,3aytvk,mfranko88,6,Wed Jun 24 23:00:08 2015 UTC,Yeah. You're right. Except I never understood the San Fran thing. Marshal is the most understanding guy ever. I never understood why he wouldn't be supportive of her spending a summer Pershing more art education and then coming home. My mom went to NYC for a summer for her acting education. My cousin lived with us for the summer and took care of me. Dad worked and was ok with it. Granted she didn't consult him. But she was scared and emotional. It can be hard to do something you know is for yourself. But yeah. A lot of the other stuff is pretty shitty.
HIMYM,3aytvk,rocklikeastone,4,Thu Jun 25 01:30:34 2015 UTC,"I think his issue was because, as he viewed it, she was putting her art directly above them starting a life together.  She went behind his back for the interview she had, even making his best friend swear he wouldn't tell him.  Marshall never put himself first for the entire series, and I think he was tired of it by that point, even though it was season 1."
HIMYM,3aytvk,blames_irrationally,3,Thu Jun 25 01:42:06 2015 UTC,"I guess I sympathize with her. I left for a job. Granted my ex was not a good fit. He wasn't a Marshall at all. He was more a Barney. It was difficult but what I resonate with in this show, as a woman, is the many times there is a choice between what is right for yourself and what is right for another person. Robin does it many times. She chooses her career which is very important to her. It also leaves her lonely for quite a while. Same thing happens to Lilly. But should she never have experienced San Fran? Should she not have asked for Rome? No I think she had to. The reverse was selfish in a less obvious way. If she never went to San Fran, she would have done what Marshal wanted. She would have then supported his time as an intern for the EDC. She would have stayed in NYC and supported him being a judge. And she wouldn't have fulfilled her dreams. All their life would have been her sacrificing for him. Of course the result is he had to sacrifice for her. Which he actually loved Rome and got to be Fudge Supreme. Plus she gave him 3 children he always wanted. I like how the show made people think about the struggle of woman independence even though many people over look that that is what the conversation is really about. Even with the mother. It was about her struggle to let go. To not let her past love hold her back. From her ex's perspective she also was 'selfish' dating him only to turn down the proposal and say to herself 'I deserve to be happy.' And then you see this in Barney. It isn't just women. Barney decided that being true to himself meant more than following Robin around the world while she followed her dream.   I know this was long but I hear people get so upset with the characters. They hate the ending. They judge the choices. But the reason I love the show so much isn't just the humor. It is that the writers never strayed from true life. This shit is what happens. People make decisions. Sometimes they are seen as selfish and then other people call them 'strong and independent.' The line there is very blurry. I'd like to think more people walk away with a broader understanding that everyone is fighting their own battle. Be kind."
HIMYM,3aytvk,rocklikeastone,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:13:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of this, however, you skimmed over the fact that Marshall sacrificed every time she wanted him to.  While he did like the end result, that doesn't mean it was fair to him.  He worked at GNB, which he hated, to provide for her, when she wouldn't even get a job.  And yeah, Rome was great, but Marshall gave up his dream job for it."
HIMYM,3aytvk,blames_irrationally,3,Thu Jun 25 05:44:43 2015 UTC,"Marshall was the one who pressured her into Rome when she had misgivings. And after he persuaded her, took a job behind her back.  I don't recall exactly why he worked at GNB but wasn't it because Barney pressured him by having him buy a super expensive suit? If you're referring to her debts, she supported him through law school and then owned up to her debts later buy selling her clothes. She was willing to divorce him so he could his dream home.  Lily is my favourite character. I hated her stealing things but I feel that Ted blamed Lily for his and Robin's initial breakup."

HIMYM,3aytvk,henrykazuka,3,Thu Jun 25 01:41:47 2015 UTC,Yes and the only thing that I can think of that defends Barneys is that he is supposed to be that way. Lily's real personality falls through the cracks of the facade she puts on. Or maybe its a TV show and i'm thinking way too much into this
HIMYM,3aytvk,MCI21,9,Thu Jun 25 02:25:19 2015 UTC,If you re-watch anytime soon pay attention to how poorly she treats all of her friends by lying to them and manipulating them.  Shes just an all around bad person - but it's entertaining and she plays the role well enough that you barely notice how dis-likable she is on the first or second watch through.  Props to AH for that...

HIMYM,3aytvk,Vaccino,-1,Mon Jun 29 04:29:55 2015 UTC,Tracy was too good for him.
HIMYM,3b27mn,DestinyCE,4,Thu Jun 25 11:12:13 2015 UTC,"I actually found it really fitting. Just think:  Tracy said just after Max died to Barney or her friends (Can't remember) ""Everybody has just 1 person in the world, and I've already had mine.""   And Max died prematurely into his and Tracy's relationship. Then, what happens to Tracy? She dies prematurely in her and Ted's marriage. Leaving Ted to not only live the life with the woman that had his kids, but also then to the woman of his dreams (Robin)  I think Ted was never in love with Zoe, or Stella, or even Robin until later on, I think he was in love with the idea of having kids with them and growing old with him.   Lily and Marshall always had eachother, obviously. Tracy and Max are now back together. Ted and Robin found eachother again, because we all remember their pact, right!? I even have a similar one with my school best friend. And finally, Barney is still single. We've always wanted Barney to be normal, but he wouldn't be Barney if he were normal. He has his little girl and it's perfect!   I loved the ending as well, I was balling my eyes out for the whole 1 hour and then refused to watch HIMYM for a year because it was too sad (And that's the TV mourning period for me) but it's the 2nd best ending of all time imo."
HIMYM,3b27mn,GetMoneySmokeWeed,-1,Thu Jun 25 15:25:22 2015 UTC,"Barney and Robin regressed to how they were back in season 2 (when they wrote the ending) only to plot reasons. The ending completely ignores everyhting happened between seasons 3-9. Tracy has to leave her children motherless,and everybody acts like they just didn't care. Even Carter Bays said that,jsut a few weeks after they finished to shoot the show,he understood that the ending didn't work,so he shoot an alternate ending."
HIMYM,3b27mn,Domyfranky,2,Thu Jun 25 15:52:28 2015 UTC,"Don't you understand it? Barney reverted back to his old ways because he couldn't cope with any other way. Robin did not in any way regress to her Season 2 state, and actually neither did Barney - because even he grew up. That still happens regardless of Tracy dying. Motherless, yes. Do you honestly think that never happens? Lily, single father, Barney, single mother, Robin, single father - see what I'm getting at here? And it didn't happen 20 seconds before Ted told them the story, it happened YEARS before. YEARS. can you contemplate that for a second?   Carter Bays may have thought after that it didn't work, and I don't blame him - it's a very successful and huge show even after coming off air and I'd feel that I made a mistake, it's Carter freaking out over 10,000 light bulbs.   But just because Bays says something, does that immediately mean he's right? Nope. So that was irrelevant, because it worked perfectly and if he ""understood that it didn't work"" then he wouldn't of ever aired it. Source please?"
HIMYM,3b27mn,GetMoneySmokeWeed,2,Thu Jun 25 22:18:44 2015 UTC,I neither love nor hate the ending. I guess the running after robin thing only makes sense with this ending....else why would he tell his kids about how much he loved robin

HIMYM,3ay41w,SpartanAttire,5,Wed Jun 24 12:56:25 2015 UTC,"Also, we knew the mother's name from season 1. In the episode in which Barney, Robin and Ted go to the thanksgiving buffet at the Lusty Leopard. At the end of the episode, Ted is approached by a stripper who hits on him and says her real name is Tracy. 2030 Ted says jokes that the stripper was the mother. The kids then yell ""what"", at which point Ted says ""only kidding"". Although the kids yelled out, they obviously believed him for a second, which they wouldn't have if he had said a fake name. EDIT: *Lusty"
HIMYM,3ay41w,henroble,3,Wed Jun 24 15:54:35 2015 UTC,"You're obviously right, but I'm not sure that logic holds. I don't think the writers put that there on purpose.  At the end of the pilot, older Ted shocks the kids (and viewers) by saying ""how I met...your Aunt Robin."" Why would the kids have been surprised the woman he met in the pilot was aunt Robin and not the mom if he had been calling her Robin the whole time?"
HIMYM,3ay41w,dorkwithastake,3,Thu Jun 25 09:53:11 2015 UTC,"Yep. I think when Ted is telling the story to his kids they don't know as many of the details as we do. We are seeing everything from Ted's perspective. When Ted is telling the story to his kids he might have said ""this girl"" or ""that women I met"", but since that wouldn't flow well in the TV world we see it from his point of view and he's able to use actual names. I personally don't think he said the girls name at the Lusty Leopard. He might have said ""This girl came up to me....and that is how I met your mother."""

HIMYM,3ay41w,rose_tattoo,8,Thu Jun 25 00:53:47 2015 UTC,"MORAL OF THE WHOLE SHOW IS THIS: DON’T REJECT A GREAT PERSON BECAUSE THEY LIKE YOU TOO MUCH YOU MAY NOT GET LUCKY... I thought that was a great conclusion   She didn't reject him because he loved her, they wanted different things in life. Robin didn't want kids and Ted certainly did. No matter how much you love someone you cannot pretend to want something you don't"
HIMYM,3ay41w,rose_tattoo,2,Wed Jun 24 13:49:44 2015 UTC,"yes she did she liked that emotional indifference that barney supplied. She was not mature enough to settle down start a family, be with someone who truly cared about her she in that attracted to the bad boy stage."
HIMYM,3ay41w,ANBU_Black_0ps,2,Thu Jun 25 00:52:45 2015 UTC,"yes she did she liked that emotional indifference that barney supplied.   No she didn't because that's how her Father treated her which she even compared Barneys emotional distance to her Fathers. She settled for Barney because she didn't think any man would want to be with her because of not wanting / can't have kids, as she states when she broke up with Kevin   She was not mature enough to settle down start a family,   She didn't want to start a family, she wanted her career. Ted wanted the family"
HIMYM,3ay41w,AdaAstra,2,Thu Jun 25 10:53:39 2015 UTC,I didn't love the ending but I also didn't hate it. I thought it had great symmetry in that the show started with him meeting Robin and stating that he would marry her one day and he does.
HIMYM,3ay41w,ender89,2,Thu Jun 25 02:51:55 2015 UTC,"Meeh, it is difficult to argue the case for or against the finale.  Everyone has their own opinions and interpretations of it.  I personally loved the finale and the entire show.  Every episode I thought was great.   The way I look at the finale, it is Ted telling a story from his perspective.  He was more lying to himself the entire show, by trying to point out why him and Robin didn't work out, when it is painfully obvious he loved Robin.  He couldn't move on from the mother's death. Him, being the romantic that he is, didn't think he could love another woman even after the mother died.  Especially when he is reminded of her for by seeing his kids.   So when his kids finally acknowledge it, it was the slap in the face he needed to understand what he has been looking for since his wife's passing, has always been there from the beginning.  That said, I can't fault people for being annoyed with the ending. I get people are upset and that is their right too.  I just can't stand when they try to tell me I'm ""wrong"" and shouldn't like the show based on their opinions of the show.  I've given up defending the finale."
HIMYM,3ay41w,GreenLuma,0,Thu Jun 25 04:52:56 2015 UTC,"There was hate for a couple of reasons. While you could say that it was obvious from the beginning (why else would Ted be lecturing his kids?) and there are hints throughout the final season, it was still a huge build up to a couple of appearances in the final season and a brief death. Which is disappointing but whatever. Okay, so they've just announced that Tracey was dead and you have about 5 seconds to begin to process the death of a character you've fallen in love with over 9 years and they smash cut to a joke about banging robin and stealing the blue french horn. I get that Ted was ready for it, the audience was not.  Then there were the character assassinations. They take Barney, who we've learned was basically a terrible human being because he was using it as a way to protect himself from the very real emotional trauma he's faced his entire life is revealed to just actually be a terrible human being until the point when he finally finds himself a father and looks into the eyes of his daughter who be is certain to fuck up, because remember that we thought robin fixed him and that turned out to be a giant lie.  Then we have robin. The entire last season was a tribute to why robin and Ted don't work, that while they have loved each other from the get go, they never loved each other enough to make the kinds of major sacrifices that any serious relationship demands. The last five minutes throw all that away and basically say that while this shit never worked once in five years, this time will be it.  Then we have Tracey's assassination (or more like their relationship). Remember that Ted has had many, many relationship over the years and that every single one of them, even ones that nearly got Ted married, failed because Ted loved robin more. He was unwilling to leave her out of his wedding with Stella and he was unwilling to leave her for his wedding (and life) with Victoria. Before Ted revealed that he was still carrying the torch with robin the assumption was that Tracey was finally Ted soulmate, a love that trumped robin, to the point where ted's ex and great love was the aunt of his kids. The woman that broke up two of ted's weddings was not only at his wedding with Tracey, but is aunt to their kids. Before Ted leaves to go bang robin one last time, we could assume this is because he was finally able to move past robin and fell deeply in love with Tracey to the point where robin didn't matter. Instead we realize that it only worked because robin was married and Ted seemingly respects that above all else (the second they both become available Ted jumps on the robin train again) because ted's been carrying a torch for robin the entire time."
HIMYM,3ay41w,Domyfranky,-1,Thu Jun 25 07:46:32 2015 UTC,"This is why I personally disliked the finale: For the ENTIRE show they build up the mother... just to have her killed off and replaced by Robin. I like Robin and all, but I would have preferred her not ending up with Ted tbh"

I'm not really an outdoors type and I have no interest in the government or politics.  I finally gave it a chance though, got past the first 5 episodes (which were still good) like people told me to and I've been hooked ever since.   I am looking for a sitcom that has good comedy (not over the top, or forced comedy)..and a decent cast.   Parks and Recreation has comedy that is definitely not over the top. It is quite simple comedy that has incredible delivery. The characters are unique and lovable. And they all come together to form quite a nice team and cast overall.  You said you were looking for a show that is currently playing, but as I understand it Parks and Rec did finish earlier this year. It is still playing as far as I'm concerned though. And you should definitely give it a shot.  Also, I'm going to just say it. It has the same style as the office but I love this show way more than the office!"

Straight up top 5 favorite episodes.   Same with ""The Platinum Rule"" in Season 3.  I love the non-linearity of both of these episodes; the different story lines tie together so seamlessly.

HIMYM,3aj8fr,MirRelevant,17,Sat Jun 20 21:59:21 2015 UTC,"A similarly great episode is Right Place, Right Time (4x22) which consists of ""I did ... because earlier ..."" eventually leading up to him meeting Stella for the first time after she left him.  Also, two episodes I really liked are Brunch (2x03) and The Burning Beekeeper (7x15) where the storyline is too complex to wrap up in one telling so Future Ted splits it up by couple and room respectively. Both contain links from start to end so when you re-watch the episode and know what's coming, certain parts of the conversations make much more sense. :)"

When Ellie is a little girl, he goes to a birthday party with her, and while Ellie plays with a little boy, he meets the mother of the boy, who happens to be Quinn. They start dating again and are quite happy. Ted and Tracy: They are really happy, but less exagerated. Before Ted proposes, they work out with great grace their past lovelives so there's no doubt they are sure they want to be with each other for the long run. They share a very sweet and cozy life together, and are great parents. After 10 years, Tracy gets diagnosed with Leucemia, and is given one year to live, top. This break Ted's heart to no meaning, and he spends the year taking care of her and being extra close to his family. She dies a peaceful death with Ted and the kids by her side. Back to Robin: When she moves back to New york, her feelings for Ted start to come back, and she feels jealous and guilty. Eventually though, she realises she is being nonsensical, and decides to catch up with the gang and be good friends with everyone else again. She actually becomes a great friend of Tracy, and when she heard about her illness, she came right up to see her and cried a lot. Tracy, calm as she can be, tells her that everything is gonna be allright, and asks her to take care of Ted when she passes away, knowing and sensing about the bond they share. Ted and Robin: The first year after Tracy dies, Ted is wrecked, but deals with it while being with his kids all the time and giving them everything they need. He is very tired. Little by little, Robin, who now is a reporter at a local station, beggins helping him with the kids, so he can also go to work. As time passes by, Robin comes to be very close to the kid, being the cool aunt Robin she is. Three years after Tracy's death, Ted and Robin begin to come closer too. Robin stays for dinner at least 2 or 3 times a week, and they always have much fun. Slowly, old feelings begin to get stronger and stronger. There's a mix between a genuine love and friendship between the two of them, and a sexual tension that grows but they chose to ignore. After six years, Ted wins a holiday on the beach for 4 people, and he invites Robin to join them. Accidentally, they give them a room with a double bed, and the hotel is full so they can't change it. The last night, the kids go out and Ted and Robin head to the bar in the hotel and while talking about old times, they get a little too drunk. Back in the hotel room, they kiss a passionate kiss for a minute or so, until they realise what they are doing, and a very confused and guilty Ted pulles away. They say nothinh, and awkwardly go to sleep. When they get back to New york, Robin talks to Lily about what happened, and confronts Ted. She says she loves him very much, and can't help but to carry the feelings she has, and that she understands him about Tracy and everything, but that she can't keep lying to herself, and that if things keep on going that way, she will have to need sometime apart for herself to work out what's going on, because being so close gets confusing. Ted is flustered and can't say anything, so Robin leaves. After an entire day, he finds an old picture of him and Tracy and stares at it. He begins to talk to her. About how much he misses her, and how hard it's been. However, he remembers what she said about not leaving in his stories. He goes out, with the wind howling in, and in reference to the scene in How your mother met me when she asks Max if she can let him go, he asks her if he can do it one last time, and then go on with his life, telling the wind he will always love her and that she will always be a part of him. That night, Ted is determined to tell the kids the story of how he met her, how he came to be the man he was to met her, and also, he was to analyse what was going on between him and Robin. He tells the story, the kids call him out about being in love with Robin, and they tell him that it's okay, it is about time and they support him. So then we come to the final scene. And of course, in my canon they get back together, im not sure if they eventually marry or not, but they are very happy, and die side by side when they get old.  I know it's fucking cheesy, but it's love sitcom!"

HIMYM,3ajhg0,Petrichor02,4,Sun Jun 21 17:54:02 2015 UTC,"I've got a few:  1) Max died during a mugging gone wrong. That's why the Mother decides that the thing she wants more than anything else is to end poverty. She believed that if there was no poverty, Max would have lived.  2) The Love Solutions girl was the Mother. I think that, after the Mother had sulked around their apartment for 8-9 months, her friend set her up on Love Solutions, filling out the Mother's application without the Mother's knowledge. The friend also lied about the Mother's age, saying she was older than she actually was, so that the Mother would be more likely to be matched up with an older/more mature guy.  This is also why the Love Solutions girl was so flexible with Ted in setting their date. The friend had left her own contact information on the forms, so Ted was speaking to the friend when he was setting up the date with her, and the friend was okay postponing the date because she hadn't yet managed to convince Tracy to actually go on the date after revealing what she had done.  Ultimately though, the friend couldn't convince Tracy to go on the date. This led to Ted believing that the Love Solutions girl wasn't calling him back asking what happened because he stood her up, and on the other end Tracy's friend thinks that Ted isn't calling to reschedule with the Love Solutions girl because she thinks Ted believes that she stood Ted up.  3) When Ted talks about doing things that causes a sign to be put up, we see three different signs before the ""Absolutely No Boogie Boarding"" sign. These signs are ""No smoking on carousel"", ""No punching llamas"", and ""No motorcycles on the show floor."" It was later revealed that Barney and Marshall were responsible for the motorcycle sign too, so that makes me think that the gang is responsible for the other two signs as well. So I think that when Barney saw Ted and Robin holding hands at the carousel, he lit a cigarette to calm himself rather than go over and confront them, which led to some sort of altercation, which distracted Barney long enough to keep him from going over to Ted and Robin right then until the moment between those two had passed (and a sign ended up getting put up because of the altercation). I also think that at some point in his life, Ted ends up in a petting zoo (maybe he takes Penny and/or Luke there?), sees Missy the Goat, takes a swing at her, and misses, accidentally punching a nearby llama, which leads to the situation where that sign gets put up.  4) The Mother is the one who dropped the penny on the subway which led to Ted staying in New York back in Season 2, and that's why they named their daughter Penny. (This is almost certainly what happened, but since it's never explicitly confirmed, it still counts as head-canon.)  5) Marshall really was mugged by a monkey. The zookeeper who brings the monkey to Robin's talk show is the same guy who keeps appearing in Marshall's story as the mugger, which leads me to believe that since neither Marshall or the zookeeper seems to indicate that a mugging occurred between them, Marshall really was mugged by a monkey, and he just used the zookeeper as the mugger because the zookeeper was nearby when it happened."

He circled ""get her drunk"" and ""emotionally vulnerable"" on a white-board, as part of an elaborate, premeditated scheme to have sex with Robin, regardless of her wishes.  There's a word for that: rapist!"
HIMYM,3ajhg0,Mark_Zajac,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:32:47 2015 UTC,"Edit: sorry for the long post. Getting into the defebition of rape is a big can of worms  I do agree with you that intentionally getting a girl drunk to have sex with them is a form of rape.   However we know that he never did it. For all we know he struggling with his feelings at the time, and as Barney does, came up with many different ideas, circling the ones more likely to work.  I don't believe that considering it as a option makes you a rapist. To be honest that option is available to many people most of the time, its clear that once Barney gave it a second thought he didn't go through with it.  However again, their are many situations throughout the series where consent comes into question, with Barney and Ted.   A few examples include:   the playbook being all lies and shenanigans, this brings up the question, if a person is consenting to sleep with Lorenzo von Matterhorn, did Barney get consent? Many of his plays involve lying, and manipulation, consent wouldn't be given if he was honest, or at least it was given under false pretenses. So is this rape?   On that note, the time where Ted pretended to be gay to sleep with that girl would fall under the same argument.  In addition, outside of the show, I think the broader defebition of rape is too unspecified. Everyone can picture the classical sence. However manipulation and even getting someone drunk with the intent of a chance at sleeping with them with lowered inhibitions ( not talking blackout drunk), whilst you yourself are under the influence is such a grey area that the law flails to define."
HIMYM,3ajhg0,Domyfranky,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:21:05 2015 UTC,"we know that he never did it   Not by choice!  Barney did not act of his own volition.  He did not sheepishly erase his whiteboard.  Au contraire,  with premeditation, he summoned Robin from Japan, callously using Ted's wedding to bait his trap.  Barney took no deliberate action to abandon his ambush of Robin.  Instead, he was defeated by his own lechery when he succumbed to the blandishments of two other women, that weekend.  It was a narrow escape for Robin.     I offer ""Sandcastles in the Sand"" as further evidence.  Robin was in a vulnerable state.  Barney and Robin lingered at the bar.  We saw Robin drinking (probably scotch) the whole time and she had a head-start on Barney.  He arrived late.  If Barney had waited, even a few hours, 'till Robin was stone-cold sober and less heartbroken, would Robin have consented to a tryst with Barney?  We know from ""The Goat"" that Robin was embarrassed and remorseful the next day.  Whatever feelings Barney might have had, it was his duty, as a friend, to resist.  Barney took advantage of Robin.     Compare this to ""Doppelgangers"" in which Robin was again heartbroken and vulnerable.  Ted warns Robin that he and she are drunk and he then seems hesitant when she leans forward.  Yes, it was lucky for Ted that his awesome hair broke the spell -- he was pulling it off! -- but Future Ted notes that a relapse with Robin that night would have been a terrible mistake.  By contrast, back in ""The Goat"" we saw Barney collecting ""BPEGs"" for his mental hard-drive.  He had no regret.  He said so.  Ted is human and nearly stumbled; he was relieved that nothing happened.  Without remorse, Barney consciously set out to recreate ""Sandcastles in the Sand"" with his ""Shelter Island"" scheme -- utterly despicable!      Too often, a narrow definition of rape is used to rationalize sexual assault.  Rape is rape.  Giving ""lovable"" Barney a free pass sends the wrong message."

He actually says he prefered the alternate ending even back in March 2014,but ""we were a team and people prefered the other one""...honestly i don't believe it,he was in charge so if he and Thomas really prefered the alternate ending they would have chosen it without any problem...so i think that now he probably understood his mistakes and he is regretful to have done that original ending. In the video he also talks about his new project,a sort of movie/musical set in a hospital with surreal vibe called ""Molly and the Moon""."
HIMYM,3a9xt0,AnghellicKarma,26,Thu Jun 18 11:55:59 2015 UTC,"I agree that he could've easily pushed what he wanted for the ending.     My guess is that he's finally acknowledging the shitstorm of the ending of his most prolific body of work and hopes to earn back some good will so that his future projects aren't outright ignored.    Honestly, I attribute How I Met Your Dad not taking off due to the scathing reaction to the finale. Hell, even the new show that was on after the HIMYM finale did poorly, likely (IMO) as a collateral damage."
HIMYM,3a9xt0,Bartimus_Prine,14,Thu Jun 18 14:48:17 2015 UTC,"The story at the time was that How I Met Your Dad wasn't given the green light because Bays and Thomas refused to make changes CBS wanted them to make. Given their refusal to make those changes, the immediate and immense backlash to the finale, and the fact that this finale was based on a refusal to change things probably made it pretty easy for CBS to pass. Additionally, how many people did the ending alienate? I know I myself haven't even been able to bring myself to watch the show again since the finale. It left such an incredibly bad taste in my mouth that I can't even get psyched about re-watching some of my favorite episodes. The dwindling viewership of HIMYM, the backlash, the refusal to change-all of these things contributed to the downfall of How I Met Your Dad."

HIMYM,3a9xt0,YAYYYwork,6,Fri Jun 19 16:39:27 2015 UTC,"I think it probably has more to do with the fact that due to how poor the final season in general was I don't know how many people would willingly want to watch a spin off. By the final season, with how terrible the episodes were I was just watching to get it over with. I liked the finale and have no issues with it. I think everyone made way too big of a deal about it as fanboys do with everything. I  really don't think I would have watched How I Met Your Dad, spin offs in general usually suck.  Edit: Also to attribute the show after the finale's failure to it seem unduly harsh. It could be due to the fact it was not a show anyone cared to see. I chalked up CBS shows years ago as they tend to be really bad. HIMYM was the only reason aside from the NFL that I put that channel on."

It seems like for complex shows, it would be good to have a lot planned out, but at the same time, any changes in the cast (leave due to pregnancy, not getting along with other cast members, quitting the show, etc) would have a drastic impact on extensively pre-planned plot, derailing the whole plan."

HIMYM,3a06sr,chas11man,42,Tue Jun 16 07:35:53 2015 UTC,I have been saying that HIMYM was based on Love in the Time of Cholera for like 3 years and I've never seen anyone else mention it! There are many similarities that I noticed even before the finale. I actually wrote an essay comparing them. Florentino and Ted have very similar characterizations and there are specific scenes that are also alike (e.g. Ted mistakes Zoey for a prostitute and Florentino mistakes Leona for one and they both end up being important relationships). Thanks for further confirming my suspicion.
HIMYM,3a06sr,partywitharetha,9,Tue Jun 16 15:32:38 2015 UTC,Were you not around this sub during and after the finale?  There were dozens of posts about this at the time!
HIMYM,3a06sr,Homitu,2,Tue Jun 16 19:26:58 2015 UTC,"Ted mistakes Zoey for a prostitute and Florentino mistakes Leona   It goes much deeper than that!      Leona comes from a poor family, just like Zoey (Season 6, Episode 22). In the novel, Leona is nick-named ""the lion"" by Florentino (and, of course, ""Leona"" is the feminine of ""Leo"" which is the lion from the zodiac). On the show, an ornate stonework lion-head is pivotal to the interaction of Ted and Zoey (Season 6, Episode 23). In the novel, Leona Cassiani attains high rank in the shipping company of rich and powerful Don Leo XII Loayza. This is like the marriage of Zoey Pierson and George ""The Captain"" van Smoot, on the show (Season 6, Episode 8). Don Leo XII Loayza and George ""The Captain"" von Smoot are doppelgangers."

HIMYM,39x5ny,PM_ME_YOUR_PANINIS,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:21:32 2015 UTC,"Ted losing his balloon   If it helps, the final season of HIMYM borrowed several plot points from ""One Hundred Years of Solitude” (OHYOS) by Gabriel García Márquez. There is a character in OHYOS named Remedios the Beauty; she is so impossibly perfect that she simply ascends into heaven one day. It seems that Robin recreated this, by floating away, reflecting Ted's view of Robin as perfect.     This is just another example of the ""magical realism"" that HIMYM borrows from the works of Gabriel García Márquez.  You were OK with ""super-date"" and the ""cockamouse"" but the apotheosis of Robin Scherbatsky?"

HIMYM,3a0ty9,rose_tattoo,2,Tue Jun 16 13:51:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah,it could be. Also,maybe they had issues with Fox because Fox really wanted to keep alive the HIMYD project but they didn't want to write it...in the last few weeks,Bays talked about the fact that some other writers could write the possible new version of HIMYD..so i think that the rights of the ""How I Met Your"" brand remains to 20th Century Fox."

Finally, we get to see the star: a grizzly bear with a ring around its neck. Although... what? CORNFLOWER BLUE! The sequence is finally played out after 3 seasons of foreshadowing. And that's how Robin met your mother: sneaking out of her own wedding and getting cold feet. Luckily Barney came through. Lily and Marshall's new vows are pretty sweet. Why is all of this crap important to Robin now? Is it wedding stress, because she never cared about that type of stuff until this season. Ted coming through for her all the time is a moot point, she's the one that ended things with him twice. Ted has finally moved on from Robin. Now the show can properly end. :'(. Final slap has been slap-ministered to calm Barney's nerves. That's Marshall's gift: freedom. Depending on which ending you like best, this is the final episode to feature Bob Saget as Future Ted. He was a calming presence for the show, and I'm kinda disappointed that he didn't play old Ted. Maybe some makeup or something. I like his voice, okay!   Only late season HIMYM could make the actual wedding ceremony between two main characters feel inconsequential."

HIMYM,39si0n,keremy,16,Sun Jun 14 09:28:55 2015 UTC,"Ranjit got a happy ending :) Gary Blauman is not dead. Barney is a liar, I'm surprised people believed this theory until this episode.  Jeanette + Kevin = two sociopaths finally finding each other. Kevin is a serial patient dater who blatantly used Robin's insecurities against her to stay together, and Jeanette is Jeanette. Zoey is still fighting the good fight. Now that she's divorced and lost Ted, is she broke? Blah-blah is revealed to be Carol. Though this reminds me of when the janitor on Scrubs revealed his name to be Matthew after 8 years, then remarks that JD/you probably won't remember and will just call him the janitor.  A lot of people were disappointed in the curly fry bit because of its resemblance to the famous ""Joey doesn't share food"" bit on Friends. The show is similar in a lot of ways but few times quite like this.  Maybe Ted is a Cracked.com writer considering the love for Teddy Roosevelt. His duel with Blauman going on for 3 days was hilarious. Am I the only one who felt the James conflict was extremely rushed? Instead of the jokes about marriage, maybe they could have given an idea of who he cheated with so it wouldn't come out of left field? Billy Zabka, world renowned poet. Eventually wins a peace prize for it. And thank HIMYM for bringing his career back to an extent. Or at least, more recognized in his current form.  HOW DID I FORGET THIS IS THE ONE WITH TED AND THE MOTHER'S FIRST DATE?! It was my favorite sequence in season 9. It felt very realistic, showing Ted doesn't need to resort to cartoon stuff to win girls over. It's so sweet how it worked out."

HIMYM,39nfkn,djSexPanther,146,Sun Jun 14 23:56:33 2015 UTC,"I can say with 100% logical certainty that grinch is a euphemism for ""cunt.""  Lily finds the word so offensive that she won't say it.  Yet, she says the word bitch repeatedly, most notably in her catchphrase ""You son of a bitch.""  Logically, grinch can't refer to the word bitch, since Lily is clearly OK with saying that word.  The only other word that makes sense in context is ""cunt.""   I'm calling it for the wife, sorry bro.    EDIT:     In support of my argument, in S02E20 Lily gets called a bitch by her seamstress after saying ""I lost all this weight without trying,"" and just shrugs it off. Also on a meta-level, Ted won't say the true word ""Grinch"" to his kids, but says bitch about a million times in the story. Ted is sitting in the bar later and says ""Grinch"" out loud, and a woman stares him down with a scowl.  Works for ""cunt,"" not bitch. Finally, some people are referring to the writers implying some kind of rhyme between grinch and bitch, but that is never actually implied in the script. http://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/view_episode_scripts.php?tv-show=how-i-met-your-mother&episode=s02e11"

HIMYM,39nfkn,snidgetphoenix,2,Sat Jun 13 15:47:24 2015 UTC,In the very first episode Lily calls Ted a little bitch for not kissing Robin. I think Grinch was used because it was a Christmas episode nothing to do with rhymes.
HIMYM,39nfkn,rose_tattoo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:59:56 2015 UTC,"If you ignore the context, then you have a point. Ted wasn't using it in a joking or lighthearted way, though, he was putting all the negative connotations that go along with the word with it. In that sense it doesn't matter how common place the word might be these days it takes on a deeper, more powerful meaning. Not something one would want to hear their future husband's best friend (not to mention her friend as well) call them.  It's important to remember that it is a sitcom and just because they could use the word on the show doesn't mean it isn't funnier to replace it with grinch."

HIMYM,39nfkn,edennov,13,Sat Jun 13 00:41:16 2015 UTC,"Bitch can be said on TV, fuck can't. Grinch fit the seasonal theme of the episode so I figured that's why they chose it as a stand-in. Sure, Lily might have still freaked out at being called a bitch by Ted, but there wouldn't have been a good reason to censor it out. And I think, at one point, she mentions there's nothing you can call another person that would equate with ""grinch"". I'd say dick and bitch are pretty similar on the offensiveness scale, but cunt blows them both out of the water.  At least here in 'murica."

I do like the metaphor that the suit didn't fit Barney until he felt confident. He will eventually have issues with his tie, but that's another story for another day. The Wedding Bride 2 is (predictably) terrible and makes no sense, but there's a special piece of trivia involved. The character Narshall (Jon Heder) ate the chocolate cake that Jed Mosley wanted in his fridge. This is a reference to a joke in This is the End where Jason Segel tells Kevin Hart the troubles of being in a sitcom for so long and how unfunny it can be after years of doing it, but Kevin Hart still keeps laughing... which in itself is a reference to a 2010 interview with GQ that references that cake bit to his TV wife about how generic HIMYM is and how he's bored of playing Marshall. Robin + Lily... Meh. But it was nice to see Robin's sister seven years later. Still haven't seen your sister again, Ted. Is she banished from canon or something? First appearance of Tracy Ullman as Robin's mother, which is really weird casting if you think about it. Still really freaking sad even in rewatching it. Ted always lives through his stories, even now, and he loves his wife so much. The ominous ""what kind of mother won't show up at her daughter's wedding?"" made me ponder what the show would be like. Now that I'm rewatching, it's one of the more blatant attempts at foreshadowing in the whole show whereas the rest of it was kind of subtle.   To be quite honest this episode isn't that good outside of The Mother."

I was shocked at how anyone could possibly interpret all the Ted/Tracy scenes to mean anything other than she was going to die. I posted this multiple times on this subreddit when the episode aired.  If people could just stop bandwagoning on the finale-hate and just rewatch the show... A lot of you had the same misconceptions/misinterpretations while watching the show the first time.

HIMYM,39gt3r,lisztoma42,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:59:29 2015 UTC,"I really understand what you're saying and i used to believe it as well (that there were so many obvious hints at the ending) but the more and more i rewatch the show, the more i think these 'hints' were far too subtle and open.   It's easy to go back and think ""how could you people be so stupid to not pick up on these hints"" after knowing the ending. The emotional scene in this episode could have easily been interpreted as ted's mum dying/had died and wouldn't be at her daughters wedding (Ted's sister). There could have been another reason seeing as Tracy was the one who said ""What mother would miss her own daughter's wedding"" so nonchalantly and yet Ted was the one who started crying, not the mother herself.  The same can be said for the emotional scene in The Time Travellers Ep where Ted says he wants those 45 more days with her. Of course it seems obvious now knowing the ending but it could also just be interpreted as Ted being so in love with her that he wanted every moment he could have with her."
HIMYM,39gt3r,flutterfly28,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:52:29 2015 UTC,Well in my case I believed all of this extremely strongly while the show was still airing. Look at my post history for evidence...

In the ""Star Wars"" mythos, ""The Mother"" always dies early.  Anakin's mother died early, setting him on the path to becoming Darth Vader.  Luke’s mother died early. Guess what? Luke (Skywalker) was raised by his aunt!"

HIMYM,39gt3r,flutterfly28,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:42:53 2015 UTC,"Because so many people whined about the the quick transition between finding out Tracy was dead and Ted moving on to Robin.  No she's been dead the entire time Ted's been telling the story. The show has dropped about a million hints about this. They confirmed it three episodes ago. This was not subtle. (You had to really fucking want it be false to believe that Ted/Tracys reactions would be appropriate for Ted's mom dying or any other theory.) You had plenty of time to wrap your head around it before the finale. But nope going to stay in denial and then hop on the bandwagon of blame.  Not saying this is true of you specifically, but that is the mindset of a lot of people here. And many of us did love the finale, so don't claim that it was objectively bad."
HIMYM,39gt3r,bookant,2,Fri Jun 12 13:20:38 2015 UTC,"You seem to have trouble separating the in-universe fiction from critique of the writing out-of-universe here in the real world.

I've seen the series from beginning to end about 3 times since the last episode aired.  I watched it on my own, once through with my roommate (around season 5), with my brother (season 6), with my mom (mid season 8), and three times with my SO before the final episode aired.  To ""catch up"" my number of watchings of later episodes, I've re-watched seasons 6 through 9 about 5 times (at least) on their own.  Additionally, it's my go-to show to put on when I have nothing to do and don't know what to watch.  I can guarantee I've watched some episodes over 60 times (examples include all the Robin Sparkles episodes).  All this doesn't include how many times I've thrown it on for background noise while on my computer or working.  I'd say I wish Netflix had totals that I can compare to, but a LOT of my watchings were from downloaded episodes I watched before I got Netflix.  When I get around to it, it'd be interesting to see if my personal server keeps a tally of the number of times I've watched a particular file!  Bottom line: I've probably spent all that time and more JUST on HIMYM...  I need a life...  Lol!"

HIMYM,390nzk,Domyfranky,16,Mon Jun 8 11:39:05 2015 UTC,"I didn't like the ending of that show, either. I know life isn't like TV or movies, but for this and HIMYM I would have liked it to be."
HIMYM,390nzk,kenba2099,37,Mon Jun 8 14:11:59 2015 UTC,"For the people who never watched that show (i just saw a couple of episodes sometimes) the sense of the interview is this: At the beginning of the story,they wanted the main girl (Joey) to ends up with the protagonist (Dawson) but then trough the series she developed a deep relationship with another character (Pacey) so,when they wrote the finale,they knew that their story evolved and turned into something else,it wasn't anymore the same story they wrote at the beginning. So they made Joey and Pacey ends up together,because that was the most natural ending in that period of the story.   ""I don't know.This isn't what the show set up to be. Maybe that's where it started,but it evolved and the show has turned into something else""."
HIMYM,390nzk,FleetwoodMacNCheese,7,Mon Jun 8 11:44:34 2015 UTC,I thought it was about killing Dawson off as opposed to Jen. I figured they could have kept that and an alternate ending be Joey becoming the amazing renowned filmmaker because she wants to tell the amazing story of the boy she grew up with. Wouldn't be too far fetched as she was already writing.
HIMYM,390nzk,RusVir,-2,Mon Jun 8 20:47:34 2015 UTC,Himym was different than that. It had a very broad timeframe. It's not like Ted ended up with Robin right away in the present day. He goes for her after seventeen years. The story and character progression were perfect. Only the pacing was the problem.
HIMYM,390nzk,II_Productions,3,Tue Jun 9 15:11:19 2015 UTC,"I didn't watch HIMYM as it aired, so I don't have the time investment others did. However I found no problem with the ending. Another season probably would have helped, but having said that, season nine did feel extremely dragged out and the bright spots were genuinely Tracey, that was when they picked up.  I love the show, I love the characters and I think the ending worked. I'm not going to preach from a mount and say it's the best ending ever, nor am I going to say it's the worst. It simply worked, doesn't change my love of the show and doesn't make me hate anyone who worked on it (seriously, some of the comments I've seen have veered onto death threats...come on guys)."
HIMYM,390nzk,ATCaver,6,Tue Jun 9 06:52:34 2015 UTC,"I just realized why I can't relate to the people who hate the ending.   I binge watched the whole show on Netflix when they released season 8, then, uh-hem, uh ""found"" season 9 and binges it too.   I didn't develop the commitment others did. Maybe that's why I'm able to stomach the ending.   Huh."
HIMYM,390nzk,sharkbait_oohaha,6,Tue Jun 9 07:23:19 2015 UTC,I watched the entire series as it aired from the first episode. I loved the ending
HIMYM,390nzk,delta_tau_chi,-1,Tue Jun 9 07:31:33 2015 UTC,"Here's why it is a bad finale:    (spoilers) After 9 years of watching the show and a whole final season devoted to a wedding between barney and robin, which ends with the beginning of ted's love story with the mother (whose name i forgot), they just add on in the very end that he is in love with robin Again."
HIMYM,390nzk,strickzilla,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:26:09 2015 UTC,"my problem with the ending was simply that of all the women Ted dated the (LOVE OF HIS LIFE) Tracey we get a 3 minute rundown of their courtship, parenthood, marriage her illness and death but we got a full 20+ episodes if Zoe, Stella, hell Victoria got damn near 2 seasons. we got to see the Krav Maga (sp?) chicks friends and 2 birthdays. even Blah Blah had more screen time with Ted than Tracey.   to be perfectly clear I'm ok with Ted and Robin ending up together, but they basically shoehorned ""the mother"" into the last episodes.   my fix would have been cut teh wedding to 6 episodes hell even 10 episodes, some of that stuff was funny, but give us a chance to see Ted FINALLY get what hes been chasing for 9 years, and then yes have it taken away from him.   THAT is life you meet the perfect person but shes taken away, just like Marshall's dad's death it would have been real, moving, touching and true to life.    all in all 6 good seasons off 9 i loved it just the ending left a bitter taste"

HIMYM,390nzk,sevintoid,-15,Tue Jun 9 17:56:52 2015 UTC,Himym was entirely built with the premise of Ted and Robin getting together at the end with misdirection and trickery. Dawson's creek was a teen drama it wasn't being built towards anything when it first started. They are completely different and taking one small piece and being like SEE!!! Is pretty stupid. There's a lot to dislike about the way Himym ended but this comparison is just lame.
HIMYM,390nzk,Willowsatine,2,Mon Jun 8 16:47:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think that HIMYM was written with the premise of Ted and Robin getting together...actually it was the opposite,then in the middle of season 1 the writers decided their Ted/Robin ending,and they stuck with it even if the series then evolved in a different direction (look at all the develop of the Barney/Robin relationship)."
HIMYM,390nzk,rose_tattoo,3,Mon Jun 8 19:07:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing with what you are saying, but I think the show was built on the premise of Ted and Robin ending up together. Even if the first 6 episodes were written with him ending up with the mother and ending there, the other 95% of the show was written with that intention.   I'm not disagreeing with people disliking the ending, or disliking the writing, or feeling like the characters outgrew their planned ending.   I just find it silly to compare a teen drama that had no overarching plan to a comedy about adults that had a very clear cut ending and story planned. It's not that one of them knew their writing better than the other, its that Dawson's creek when they went into writing the finale they took into account the progression of the characters because they had no pre-thought of what the ending would be for their characters in previous seasons.  HIMYM was built on a premise and they stuck to that premise to the end. If you want to say they ignored the progression of their characters, I won't disagree, but Dawson's creek didn't know their characters better, they just didn't have a plan, which helped them write their finale with character progression in the fore front of their minds."
HIMYM,390nzk,jelatinman,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:50:40 2015 UTC,of course they had a plan. the plan was for dawson and joey to end up together because they are soul mates. thats like a big thing for that show. but in the end they realized that while joey and dawson were soul mates it was pacey she belongs with because that is what felt right. just like how it felt right for barney and robin to be together. so yea the writers for himym just wrote for themselves as opposed to writing for the characters.
HIMYM,390nzk,anonymousflash,2,Mon Jun 8 20:55:01 2015 UTC,"just like how it felt right for barney and robin to be together. so yea the writers for himym just wrote for themselves as opposed to writing for the characters.

HIMYM,390nzk,anonymousflash,-41,Fri Jun 12 08:48:11 2015 UTC,"A few tips:   It's not a good idea to post things repeatedly bashing the talent involved with the show in a forum dedicated to it (seriously, go to /r/community and criticize it at all). You're one of the more frequent posters here, so you clearly like the show. Your comment history shows nearly every comment you've made about this show (is this an alt?). Why keep coming here if you both detest and love a show?"
HIMYM,390nzk,snidgetphoenix,26,Mon Jun 8 14:00:17 2015 UTC,"What are these ""tips"" of yours for exactly other than to stifle the actual opinions of fans of the show? Personally, I HATED the ending but loved the show. I think they did a real injustice to the show by centering an entire season around a wedding only to break it up within minutes of the finale without giving their audience a chance to understand it before quickly moving on to the next point. The writing was sloppy and I think they deserve to be called out for it on reddit or other public messaging boards. There is no reason to try and sugar coat the show when the ending was really sour to many of its fans.   Why keep coming here? I keep coming here for stuff like this to be honest. I'm glad I'm not alone in feeling this way. There is a real community of people that loved the show but hated the ending. And I've seen plenty of people state their opinions about it (which I agree with for the most part). I don't see people being attacked more or less. I do see disagreements. But I rarely see people giving out little tips to people like you did to OP.   The content in this post IS relevant to the show. It shows how even though a show started with one ending in mind, the show evolved to a point where the ending had to be different. I think the writers of HIMYM could have taken a page from their book."
HIMYM,390nzk,tiffac,16,Mon Jun 8 15:03:54 2015 UTC,"A few tips from me too:   -Not liking the ending isn't the same thing that not liking the show.

HIMYM,390nzk,mbrw12,3,Mon Jun 8 14:48:29 2015 UTC,"How does liking the ending or not liking the ending have anything to do with level of devotion to the show? I've watched the entire show three times and it's gotten me through some hard times, and I love the ending. It wasn't executed particularly well (they cut some very important scenes that made it clear Ted loved Tracy more than he ever loved Robin which would have quashed the ""Ted always just wanted Robin"" nonsense) but the concept was really good, in my opinion. The real issue was season 9 entirely taking place during one weekend (which to my knowledge was partly due to Jason Segal's demands that he be allowed to do a large percentage of his scenes off set, hence all the car driving green screen stuff), which forced them to jam pack vastly too much information into the finale."
HIMYM,390nzk,AnghellicKarma,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:58:47 2015 UTC,"Because the more one got pissed for the ending,the more means that he/she really cared about it.

Anyway,i don't doubt about your attachment on the series,of course."
HIMYM,390nzk,markermagic,4,Mon Jun 8 15:07:23 2015 UTC,"The more pissed you are the more you care?

I do think that my all-time favorite scene is the one in Vesuvius about ""mothers missing weddings."" I think that Ted's reaction to that comment was the best acting that I've ever scene. It seemed so pure and realistic when he just stared at her and broke down. I've rewatched that scene several times and it still brings tears to my eyes. For a similar reason, Marshall's reaction to his father's death is also incredibly moving. I don't mean to pit the two shows against each other, but I've just finished both Friends and HIMYM and I prefer HIMYM because it was able to bring me to this emotional level."
HIMYM,393hwm,TacticianMagician,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:56:17 2015 UTC,"I can't even compare the two shows. I watched Friends as it was airing, and I got really emotional when it ended because I grew up on the show. I came into HIMYM during season 3, so it was also an emotional ride and ending for me. But, the two of them are so different. They're painfully similar in a lot of ways, but they're very different. Friends is more wistful and light hearted. One of my favorite things about HIMYM is how many small connections they have to everything. In the end, it all ties together, so I agree that the ride to the end is more emotional and the show itself brings up more emotion.   And the scene in Vesuvius is so... heartbreaking. I definitely think the acting is amazing on both of their parts. Josh Radnor does an amazing job portraying real sadness!"
HIMYM,393hwm,TacticianMagician,2,Thu Jun 11 23:07:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I see the similarities, but they were almost completely different in tone and content in the end (I watched HIMYM first and was praying that Jack Geller wouldn't die the whole time I watched Friends)."

Plus he probably should have died since they kept feeding him drinks til 2AM. So now we know the real fate of Barney and Ted's mom, the only other woman to really steal his heart: got to first but got thrown out trying to make a single into a double. Ted can live with that somehow.  What does Barney do for a living? Heh, please. Seriously though, Barney's takedown of the man who ruined his first relationship was badass, but not very well thought out. He could have very well been incriminated for all of the stuff he did with the company despite reporting it to the Feds.  Speaking of the Feds, his loyal cooperation with them leads me to believe his womanizing ways were seriously exaggerated by Ted, because episodes like this prove he can be a normal guy.  Barney really does love Robin that much that he'd bring in the best ring bear(er) possible. We still don't know whether it is a ring bear though. See? Look at that fight with Marshall and Lily. It was intense and probably the highest stakes the couple has had since the beginning of the show. ""You broke up with me and moved to San Francisco. Were me and Marvin and any future kids we may have just a consolation prize?"" Marshall would never have stood up for himself if it weren't for the bullying and coaching Daphne gave him.

Alright I at least laughed at how they got Carl to agree to saying ""this is much gold."" This episode was notably controversial due to the accidental yellow face that happened, when the creators clearly we're going for a Kill Bill-type tribute. Looking back, only the Robin segment really looked like Yellow Face, though I'm going to have to watch again to make sure. This is HIMYM's ""The Puerto Rican Day,"" a Seinfeld episode banned from reruns for years because it depicted a scene of Kramer accidentally burning a Puerto Rican flag. It came out right before the finale, and hurt some of the momentum it had but overall the show is unscathed.  This is the one with Boyz II Men right? I remember the specific face Jason Segel had: extreme, uncomfortable regret and a need for the show to end.    The first 2/3 are funny, though I do realize why people hate it. It's a breather episode, and it's actually the last breather because every episode thereafter is important to plot and/or character development."

I guess they do more than economics now considering they're playing at a wedding.  And that's how Marshall met your mother: walking on the road to the chapel. Of course it took this long for Marshall to get there, he's out of shape and carrying an Eriksen baby. The timeline between Bedtime Stories and The Rehearsal Dinner and this episode is unclear, however.  The driving gloves! Being a bassist! She's still perfect for Ted, though how she knew that Marshall was Lily's husband is kind of a mystery to me. At least she stole the van, and revealed a flaw: she's afraid of confrontation.  Lots of big confrontations and plot development in the form of a plot device within a character. It's exaggerated, but I have met people like Darren who love drama and will do anything to keep it going.  Barney is such a good friend for knowing why Ted is leaving in an exchanged look.  Why yes Lily, you've been so obsessed with your own crap you can't enjoy your best friend's wedding. This is consistent with her character though. Good way to bring back the pause button.   Great episode, Cristin Milioti really fit in with all of the characters and this episode was really good.

HIMYM,380fw7,P15T0L_WH1PP3D,2,Mon Jun 1 03:20:58 2015 UTC,I usually prefer lyft as a rider because I've found that the drivers tend to be happier but the few times I use lyft or uber usually ends up being during surge times so whichever has lower prices ends up dictating my choice. Consistent prices and setting a time ahead of time  are the only two things I like about actual taxis.

HIMYM,3832d4,xie323,6,Mon Jun 1 14:29:19 2015 UTC,"I think most of the characters, except for Marshal, maybe, are pretty morally dubious. Though, it is a comedy, and comedy usually comes from misery (like having a bowling ball fall on the toe of a character, who screams in a high pitched voice). So, for the sake of comedy, the characters either inflict suffering, or suffer something. The main characters being ""bad"" people is pretty common in this genre."

HIMYM,3832d4,masternarf,3,Wed Jun 24 19:51:20 2015 UTC,"You know,you are right,Ted is so much better than the ""typical Nice Guy tm"" but the finale put him in a bad light,not for his fault,but for Carter Bays and Craig Thomas's fault. Because they basically wrote the ending like a ""dream"" of a ""typical nice guy"",where the girl ends for regretting the nice guy,and she suffers alone until he is finally ready to give her a chance. You know,it just sounds like a sort of ""revenge"": ""ah ah you didn't chose me,now i'm happy with someone else and you'll cry me a river"". And i know that Ted would never think something like that,but the moral of the story it's that...it's like a typical plot of a classic rom-com,you are right when you say that it's evident that it was written back in 2005,when society was different from now. For the modern audience,this plot sounds a little ""sexist"" just a little bit. Anyway,you are right,the B-R shippers usually are too hard on Ted,but there is also a few people here on reddit that are at the same time too hard on Barney...i think both the approaches are wrong."
HIMYM,3832d4,Domyfranky,3,Tue Jun 2 11:48:03 2015 UTC,"Had ""C&C"" tried a little harder to make the audience/viewers feel that 6 years had passed since Tracy's death, all would have been fine.  I think Robin looks the worst out of the characters- she was developed poorly over the last 2-3 years, and then appeared to be a regretful whiner when she complained about not being a part of the group and being jealous of Tracy.  THAT made things look really bad in that last 20 minutes of the finale."
HIMYM,3832d4,Ericws,3,Wed Jun 3 13:26:32 2015 UTC,You have to keep reminding yourself that it's Ted who is telling the story. He is the one that's portraying himself in a negative light. He could hage made himself a super hero but he is telling the kids what he was like mand why he needed to change to be with Tracy.  Ted is my favorite character.  The Swarkles fans are in denial and refused to see Barney and Robins relationship disintegrating throughout Season 8 and 9
HIMYM,3832d4,rose_tattoo,2,Tue Jun 2 05:52:32 2015 UTC,There is no objective reason as to why people like Ross but not Ted aside from nostalgia (it happened when i was younger so it´s better) and bias (i like Ross with Rachel but not Ted with Robin so i will critizise one and love the other even though there are so many similarities).
HIMYM,3832d4,diegoft,2,Mon Jun 1 18:15:45 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the problem boils down to bays/thomas ruining years and years of character development within 21 minutes: Barney (as much as i like his character) is a male slut again, Robin is a workaholic and Ted is (after all those years) still searching for someone to be with...  God, I loved when he met TM and I loved every second of them on screen together ... and honestly if you wrote her to die, so be it. but seriously, dont make Ted regress 10 years and fall back into his old habbits of someone who's giving his life for a woman, who doesn't feel the same way for him..."

Thats why none of his previous ones worked."
HIMYM,37zvq3,Domyfranky,5,Sun May 31 20:50:22 2015 UTC,"I did want that after the born of Barney's daughter,Robin and Barney try another shot together. Honestly it would have more sense than Ted and Robin together. I still can't buy the fact that Robin suddendly falls in love again with Ted,and completely forget her love for Barney. People who defends Ted and Robin together always see the things from the Ted point of wiew,he always loved her etc. but what about her point of view? Isn't that important? From a writing standpoint you can't show a Robin in love with Barney for the last 3 seasons (at least),and suddendly show her in love with Ted again. That's just feel wrong,even if it makes sense (which it doesn't,for me) it still feels wrong,because just in the previous episode she was still in love with Barney."
HIMYM,37zvq3,rose_tattoo,-5,Sun May 31 21:51:30 2015 UTC,You do realize that when Ted went to Robins it was about 10 years after Barney and Robins divorce. How long do you want her to sulk about Barney?

I know that life doesn't work out great sometimes, and I didn't need to be reminded of that in what I thought was a romantic sitcom.    I was just so disappointed with the overall direction of the last season.  I actually haven't watch HIMYM since the finale, it's pretty much ruined for me.

HIMYM,37zvq3,Domyfranky,3,Sun May 31 23:42:59 2015 UTC,"To the people who says ""did you wanted a fairytale? life isn't perfect"" i remember to them that we already saw trough the series that life wasn't perfect,we saw loss of parents (Marshall),serious daddy's issues (Lily,Barney,Robin),fertility issues (Robin),loss of boyfriend (Tracy),loneliness (Ted) and other stuff like that,perfectly written (""Last Words"" or ""Symphony of Illumination"" are some of the best episodes of the show). Did we really need to see that even in the ending? I don't think we needed it at any cost. Also,i want to remind to those people that even tv shows darker than HIMYM like Mad Men or Dexter had an happier finale than the HIMYM one,so i wonder why only HIMYM felt the desire to show us that ""life isn't perfect""."

He wanted to try to be a better man,and he thought that with a woman like Nora (who is sweet and caring,and she wanted a family) he could improve,but eventually he never truly loved her so he cheated on her with Robin. With Quinn,he had a connection with her because the two were very similar,but in the end he just sabotaged himself with that absurd prenup. Instead,he really loved Robin,so it's strange to see a Barney that after the divorce acts like he didn't care at all. I expected to see him at least regretting that maybe he was a bad husband,or maybe just appear sad when the gang was talking about Robin...instead they made him act like he always was a playboy and he could never change,but we know that's not true."

I can't believe it took this long for Ted to know the Lily secret since Robin has known for quite a while. The puppy surprise was really messed up.

HIMYM,37uam1,Domyfranky,47,Sat May 30 13:22:37 2015 UTC,I felt the ending was really rushed when they finally got to the point. As for the twist I'm not so much annoyed with how they killed off the mother but rather how they trivialised it right after. In my opinion they could have just cut after Tracy's death with a sort of glimpse of their life together. Whether Ted ends up with Robin later could have been left up to imagination.
HIMYM,37uam1,beardedferret,80,Sat May 30 14:35:16 2015 UTC,"1) Quality > quantity. Tracy gave Ted his children, and didn't leave by choice. So it was the most meaningful period of his life (true love, kids).   2) It's a trade off between feeling sad about their loss (which realistically they only remember their mom for a few years) and watching their dad grieve/be alone for 6 years. Makes more sense to hide their feelings and push their dad to be happy. Kids adjust faster than adults.  I still say the finale was lost on people because they weren't able to empathize with two people who were alone in their mid to late 50s. That's when history and friendship can be enough, and other types of love exist than ""true love"" or whatever you define it as.  Life isn't linear and clear cut - all those arcs of growth/failures had to happen, and new arcs need to be made after loss. You don't reach some arbitrary wife/2 kids/house/dog and roll credits."
HIMYM,37uam1,aversion25,28,Sat May 30 14:12:27 2015 UTC,"I agree. And when you think about it, Tracy had the same experience Ted had. She was with a guy for years. He was perfect. I don't remember it being said but I can only imagine that she intended on being in that relationship for the long run. Then he died. She went years grieving. She was miserable. But you know, she eventually moved on. I can only imagine that she would want Ted to do the same thing. Sure, she was unimaginably important to Ted, and I was heartbroken when I watched the finale, but at the end of the day, life goes on. And Ted shouldn't have to be alone. Ted and Robin will always love each other. Maybe not the way Ted and Tracy did, but in the end, Ted got what he wanted: a wife, kids, a house, etc. As upset as the finale made me, I think everything worked out pretty well."
HIMYM,37uam1,ThisIsntCheese_,12,Sat May 30 15:23:51 2015 UTC,"This isn't really lost so much as rushed.   They could have done this tale beautifully, but basically the last episode would have been a whole season."
HIMYM,37uam1,aelysium,5,Sat May 30 15:25:43 2015 UTC,Yep I agree! But I think its okay given their constraints (20-22 min sitcom that is allowed 40 minutes for finales). This type of show that built up the series the last episode needed a 1.5-2 hr finale to do it justice.
HIMYM,37uam1,aversion25,19,Sat May 30 15:53:26 2015 UTC,"Or they could've not spent 20 episodes on a wedding that lasted 10 minutes in the finale. The last season was horribly mismanaged, in my opinion"
HIMYM,37uam1,ramesali786,5,Sat May 30 16:14:47 2015 UTC,"The flashback length lasted from the first episode-->final meeting on train platform (with a few flash forwards thrown in as an epilogue of sorts) to get to the point of why Ted was telling the story (asking permission to move on). An epilogue gives you a glimpse of the characters for closure but not much more (and that's exactly what we got in the finale).   The focal point of the wedding weekend was that it was the last time the whole gang was around ; after that they got busy traveling, having kids, and leading their own lives. The point was not about the marriage and how long it lasted. And on rewatch you notice a lot of the misdirection showing the marriage wouldnt last on top of the theme of them separating (with the whole Blauman/losing touch thing).   S9 wasn't that great, but it basically let the production team/cast/crew pay homage to the show in their own way/end their job of 9-10 years."
HIMYM,37uam1,aversion25,5,Sat May 30 16:54:10 2015 UTC,"It kind of makes sense that in their (Ted's) memory, the last time they're all together would be such a long story. It's almost like he's trying to savour the last hurrahs of his group by stretching out that final weekend."
HIMYM,37uam1,speenatch,10,Sat May 30 22:48:59 2015 UTC,"I think you are missing, and a lot of people do, the point of the entire story telling. Ted told a story about meeting Tracy, and Tracy was barely in it. He wasn't telling them the story to talk about their mom, he was telling them the story to talk about Robin. This whole damn show, all 9 seasons, was about Ted and Robin. Yes, Tracy was Ted's dream woman, but dreams fade and life happens. Life is ""nasty, brutish, and short"" and when things happen out of your control, you must be able to adjust to them. He will never have any less love for Tracy, she was and always will be the love of his life, but people are capable of loving, even romantically. This show, this story, was all about Ted telling a classically long-winded story about how he, 6 years after Tracy has died, that he still has feelings for the woman he saw across the bar. He's allowed to live his life and that's what his kids tell him to do, especially now that they are teenagers a don't need as much direct supervision. The concept that the entire show was about the audience meeting the mother was turned on its head in the finale to show you this exact point."
HIMYM,37uam1,ferfer1313,5,Sat May 30 15:47:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah i know,and that is the thing that compromise Tracy's importance in the story...we thought that this was the story of how Ted let the past (Robin,and all his failed relationships) go,and opened his heart to the true love,instead in the finale they revelead that this was the story of how Ted managed to move on after his wife died and how Robin was always important to him. It's a complete change of the main theme of the story! For nine seasons we believed that Robin was Ted's past and Tracy was Ted's present and future. Instead,in the ending they suddendly revealed that Tracy is Ted's past and Robin is again Ted's present and future."
HIMYM,37uam1,ferfer1313,6,Sat May 30 16:37:27 2015 UTC,"The thing I feel you are missing is that Robin was never Ted's past. She was always part of his life and he always loved her. That does not take away from the love he had and certainly would still have for Tracy. The love of one person doesn't make loving another less meaningful. Just because he loves Barney doesn't mean his love for Marshall is lesser because of it. Love is something you give to another person because you feel they deserve it and you're inclined to give it. His love for both Robin and Tracy is completely sincere on both ends. It's also different and in no way means that his love for Tracy is diminished because he moved on after.  The other thing is, the writers had this planned from Day 1, whether everyone knew or not. The whole point of the show was to lead in one direction and then show you that you were mistaken. To make you think there's such a thing as ""true love"" and then pull the rug and make you realize that all love is true love, if you're honest and sincere about it. The show was absolutely about love, but it actively worked to clearly up the crazy romanticism we have about the term and showed us that love is love is a choice, it takes work, and it can be incredibly painful, but to never give up on love no matter how many times it kicks you in the teeth."
HIMYM,37uam1,rose_tattoo,7,Sat May 30 16:52:47 2015 UTC,"Tracy was very important to Ted..not to the audience.  We have watched these 5 characters for years, enjoying the journey. So it's good to see them together.  The kids will always miss their Mother and probably got the chance to say their good byes to her, but at this point when you consider that Robin came back into their lives in 2020, she has been in their lives longer than Tracy. She has obviously filled a void for them"
HIMYM,37uam1,NeoMegaRyuMKII,6,Sat May 30 14:48:20 2015 UTC,"Ted went back to Robin because she was a woman in his life that he knew, trusted, and (as you said) one with whom has built a relationship for YEARS. He couldn't use Marshall or Lily since they were married and had their own difficulties and Barney was Barney. Ted never loved Marshall or Lily or Barney the way he loved Robin. But he also never loved Robin the way he loved Tracy. Robin does not become the one true woman in Ted's life. Robin became the person Ted could go to for sanity. For some time, yes, Robin was the woman in Ted's life but this was all before Tracy. The story isn't so much about meeting the mother so much as the journey to meeting the mother. Robin played just as important a role in Ted's life as Marshall, Lily, and Barney - it's just that he didn't feel the exact same feelings there. And don't forget he waited - he didn't just go to Robin right away. Nobody seems to remember this. Tracy died in 2024 or 2025.   The kids don't act super touched because they actually understand what he is trying to say. And as for FDR/""Mosby-style"" jokes, well... it can be pretty amusing to hear about all the funny things one did in one's stupid years.  The ending was rushed, no doubt about it. The wedding stuff should have been shortened a little and given us more of Ted and Tracy. It should have. But Tracy dyeing and Ted hoping to reignite with Robin fits one of the biggest themes in the series, which is moving on. Marshall had to move on (initially) when Lily left for SF. Ted and Marshall had to move on with their careers. Robin (and in some ways, Barney) had to move on from her career-mindedness and having minimal desire for relationship. Ted, Robin, and Barney all had screwed up relationships and they moved on. Even Tracy moved on when her boyfriend died.  <might edit later for more>"
HIMYM,37uam1,DickieIam,3,Sat May 30 16:06:32 2015 UTC,"I think the reason why the story overall takes 8 years to tell in our time is to illustrate how ridiculously long and protracted an explanation Ted is giving to his children as to why he is justified in dating Robin now. And even though from our perspective the end is sad really just kind of disappointing. From the children's perspective it's really a pretty exciting moment because they can finally get him to shut up.  And even though from our perspective Tracy just died and Ted is all of a sudden, right on schedule, back on the Robin train! For them, they already know the story of ""How I loved your Mother"", he had to tell them, ""How I met your Mother"" to justify getting back with someone finally after however many years they've moved on and Ted has been mopping around the house picking at Tracy's things.  The kids are ready for him to move on from this story that's who's perspective we're supposed to be visualizing from. Even though we're cheated from knowing every god damn detail of the interim 17 years. We as the kids are ready for him to go or do what he has to do so we can get back on the holophone or whatever."
HIMYM,37uam1,awesomeness0232,5,Sun May 31 18:22:31 2015 UTC,"The thing that really bothered me is that the kids said something about the fact that Ted didn't really tell the story to talk about how he met the woman of his life, but so that he could as out Robin. So they were pretty directly saying ""Hey you know how we called the show 'How I Met Your Mother' and built her up for nine years? Well we got you! It's not even really about her! You stupid viewers!"" To me this was the real slap in the face, and really makes your point. It just shows that the show was NEVER about the mother. It was about Robin. And the creators thought it would be funny to lie to the viewers and then point and laugh when it was over. The whole show which had always, through all the comedy, been so poetic and sweet, was reduced to a joke in the last episode."
HIMYM,37uam1,rose_tattoo,5,Sat May 30 16:13:57 2015 UTC,The kids already knew how their parents met. Now he is telling a much more detailed version of the story...so there was a reaon for it.  You saw how they met didn't you?
HIMYM,37uam1,awesomeness0232,4,Sat May 30 17:02:32 2015 UTC,Yeah but they outright said that his real motive for telling the story was to get permission to ask our Robin.
HIMYM,37uam1,rose_tattoo,1 point,Sat May 30 17:07:12 2015 UTC,Who said that?
HIMYM,37uam1,awesomeness0232,5,Sat May 30 17:08:58 2015 UTC,"The kids. Go watch it again. I'm not making assumptions, it's explicitly stated."
HIMYM,37uam1,awicybob,4,Sat May 30 17:24:03 2015 UTC,"It's called that because Ted thinks that he is telling the story of how met their mother. Ted isn't intentionally focusing on the robin parts, he is doing it subconsciously. The kids, as listeners, notice this before he does. So the title is not necessarily what the show is about, but what the unreliable narrator of the show thinks he is talking about the whole time."
HIMYM,37uam1,awesomeness0232,2,Sat May 30 22:54:51 2015 UTC,"Right, but Ted isn't a real person he is a fictional character dictated by the script of the show. And the show was really about Ted asking permission to date Robin."
HIMYM,37uam1,rose_tattoo,2,Sat May 30 23:11:54 2015 UTC,"Then how does the script from the Brunch episode fit into your black and white world?  TED: ""When I have kids, I'm going to tell them everything about how I met their mother, the whole damn story"""
HIMYM,37uam1,awesomeness0232,0,Sun May 31 08:09:39 2015 UTC,You're right I'm the only person that thought that Tracy's importance was way understated and Robins was way boosted in the finale. It was clearly a perfect and poetic finale with no flaws.
HIMYM,37uam1,awicybob,2,Sun May 31 12:56:53 2015 UTC,"That's true but you're missing the point of unreliable narrators. The show is about ted telling the kids how he met their mother. Hence the title 'how I met your mother'. Any other subconscious motives he had don't factor into the title of the show because that wouldn't make sense. The title clearly relates to the framing device from the narrator's perspective. If the title were 'how the viewer meets ted's wife' then it wouldn't make sense because, you're right, that's not what the show is ultimately about. But since it is clearly titled from ted's perspective and that's the story he thinks he's telling it makes perfect sense even if it is not completely true."
HIMYM,37uam1,awesomeness0232,2,Sun May 31 21:18:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it doesn't make sense, I'm saying that it was a disappointing direction to go. It's certainly plausible that Ted thinks he is telling the kids the story of how he met their mother but is subconsciously trying to get permission from his kids to start dating. That's not the issue. The issue is that from a writing standpoint, it was an upsetting way to end the show. My point is that the show is still written by writers and they could've ended it in a more satisfying way for the audience. At the end of the day that is who TV shows are directed at. I'm not saying that the ending doesn't make sense, it makes perfect sense. I totally understand what happened. I'm saying that the ending is badly written and not satisfying for the viewers who were loyal to the show for so many years."
HIMYM,37uam1,awicybob,2,Sun May 31 21:32:12 2015 UTC,"This. The defenders of the finale always defends it saying that the ending makes sense,that Ted had to move on etc. but we know that,we are not saying that the ending doesn't ""make sense""...but from a writing standpoint,the ending is bad because it completely changes the main theme of the show,and it completely ignores almost everything happened between seasons 3-9."

Good guy Marshall standing up to Daphne and still helping her out. Marshall's arc will be continued for the next few episodes as Ted/Robin/Barney take a bit of a backseat.  Final appearance of John Lithgow as Jerry, Ben Vereen as Sam, and Loretta. Introduced the funny recurring gag that the world really doesn't like William Zabka, aspiring poet and former actor. Though the plot was done in a really dumb way with ""Zabkatage."" Ted Mosby has proven time and again that if he actually used his intuition to find a conclusion as well as he finds evidence, he'd be an ace sleuth. But I'm a sucker for being a detective lover so this plot had a soft spot for me. Ted with a beard and a board involving the Pineapple Incident is one of the best jokes of season 9. The main plot is as weird as it sounds. Ranjit kidnapping Jerry's wife, Barney sabotaging an elevator, both Barney and James hoping their mom gets with their respective parents... It's not executed very well aside from an I Love Lucy homage from Hell. ""GIVE ME BACK MY WIFE, YOU SON OF A BITCH!"" John Lithgow, could you have pulled a Liam Neeson if you wanted to?"

This is what IMDb's FAQ section says on the matter:  Fandom is divided into two camps on this issue: Those who believe it's the four-letter ""c word,"" and those who believe it's the five-letter ""b word.""  The ""c word"" camp's argument is that the ""b word"" has been used repeatedly on the show (even by Lily herself) with no major negative reaction, so the word must be significantly more offensive, particularly to women, to get the reaction it did from the different people exposed to it in this episode.  A now defunct section of the official CBS HIMYM website had a glossary (""Motherspeak"") that defined ""grinch"" as ""a four-letter word you can never call a woman.""  Those in favor of the ""b word"" note the rhyme shared by the two words, and contend that context plays enough of a part in the offensiveness of the word that Future Ted would censor it in this instance and not in others.  The creators once mentioned in an interview that the incident in this episode was based on real-life events, and the word in the real-life instance was the ""b word.""  So it looks like there's evidence either way. Ted doesn't seem like he'd ever say the ""four letter c word"" to me."

Last Forever, the final episode of How I Met Your Mother, is so shockingly bad, fans were begging for it to all be a dream or for it to be some sort of practical joke. Unfortunately, it was neither.  For a while in the ninth season, How I Met Your Mother seemed to be working towards a pretty great ending. Sure, the ninth season had a whole lot of dumb filler, like the rhyming episode or a subplot about whose mom makes the best eggs. But all the big emotional moments were pulled off pretty well, like Ted finally letting go of Robin before Barney and Robin’s wedding. But just kidding! Remember how so much of the series was about letting go and moving on to a better future? The finale features Ted, seemingly not having learned anything from the past nine seasons, running back to a decade old, failed relationship. The mother dies off screen, Barney and Robin get divorced, and everything is miserable. We don’t even have any time to process the mother’s death before we get a moment with the kids that’s played for laughs, and then Ted goes running back to Robin in an ending that’s supposed to be seen as a victory but is actually just sad.  Way to ruin the entire series in the span of one episode."""

It has since become either revered in hindsight or even more reviled, but the show itself is still somewhat popular despite many people knowing the ending. But overall, it was a finale to a sitcom. Coming from a guy who finds this his favorite show (the only one I can rewatch multiple times), it's just a finale to a sitcom. Personally I enjoyed it after my initial hatred died down, as it was smarter and gave great rewatch value to catch hints towards its ending. Though the scene with the kids is one of the biggest mistakes of not just the show, but all of American television.  Then again, one of my closest friends still avoids the show after binging to the finale, not giving it any thought. Perhaps there is credence to it almost ruining the show after all."

HIMYM,37hhck,allblackhoodie,17,Wed May 27 17:48:51 2015 UTC,"This always bugged me but I eventually concluded that this was because Robin realised Barney wasn't playing around, he was 100% serious about being with her, and was willing to marry her to prove it"
HIMYM,37hhck,EVH98,7,Wed May 27 22:24:56 2015 UTC,"You can only make that argument if you ignore Barneys engagement to Quinn. They were engaged and living together then they broke off the engagement because of trust issues in November, and now Barney is proposing to Robin in December with the same issues. This was the recurring issue for the rest of the series. So their divorce wasn't unexpected for me."
HIMYM,37hhck,rose_tattoo,8,Fri May 29 05:52:20 2015 UTC,"This initially bothered me, too. And I'm sure if I were to re-watch the episode, it would again.   For me it was the ""Hope she says yes"" that made Robin forget all of that. For example, if Barney would have written ""She says yes"" - Robin would have been another number, another conquest that he tricks and makes a fool of. It would have been just another one of his plays. But with ""hope"" it shows that Barney is not want to trick her to say yes; he is giving her the opportunity to decide for herself. It shows that he values her.   It's the first play where the girl is in control of the situation. And because Robin and Barney had feelings at different times S6-S8, it had to take a very drastic ploy to get them both on the same level regarding their relationship."
HIMYM,37hhck,starfunkel,10,Thu May 28 00:31:49 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from here but it is important to remember that Robin (if not in this episode then in others for sure) was trying to get Barney out of her system because she didn't want to love him, but did anyway. That's why Ted kept telling her to get out of the car and go to the roof; because all the things Robin mentioned that you listed above are true, but even Ted, the guy who loved Robin for years, knew that she loved Barney. Make sense?"
HIMYM,37hhck,Chrispocrunch15,2,Wed May 27 18:09:13 2015 UTC,"At this point Robins self esteem has hit rock bottom. She seems so desperate to be in any kind of relationship that she is wiiling to put up with this and more to come. When Barney got engaged to Quinn a few months earlier, he said to Robin this was their last chace to run off together, she said no, she was happy for him.   Now she is wiiling to go and destroy another womens moment, even if it was a con, she didn't know that. Maybe it was because she thought it was Patrice that was why she went up to the roof to ruin it for her.   It was also shitty of Barney to do this on Teds big night."

HIMYM,37e43g,Swankified_Tristan,2,Wed May 27 15:13:36 2015 UTC,"My headcanon is that Ted call the kids home after school and started to tell them the story of how he met their mother.  The kids were in their pilot clothes during well... The pilot. The pilot is the most important because as we know now the point of the story is Ted's connection to Aunt Robin. That being said, Ted probably took the longest to tell this portion of the story.   Then he decided he would take a break from telling the story and pick it up a few days later.   The furniture also looks different.  Of course the real reason is because the producers didn't know whether they were going to get picked up or not so they didn't need this to look too fancy.  However, I decided to make up a deeper reason. I believe after Tracy passed away, he rearranged the living room because seeing it preserved in the way that he and Tracy enjoyed it for so many years hurt too much.  However, now that he was ready to move on but still keep the memory of he and his wife time together, he decided to put it back the way that she and him liked it.  So after he and the kids rearranged the furniture and the kids got into some more comfortable clothes, he started taking up the story again which is why his first line in the next episode is "" alright, where was I?""   The story from there starts relatively early in the morning and finishes later that night when Ted is convinced by the kids to go after aunt Robin.  Hope this gives you something to become your head canon as well."

HIMYM,376non,Domyfranky,41,Mon May 25 09:03:21 2015 UTC,"""Here's a warning to TV writers: Never plan too far ahead. HIMYM co-creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas reportedly decided early in the run of their sitcom that they wanted the hero Ted Mosby to end up with his ex-girlfriend Robin (Cobie Smulders) — even though they'd explained in the show's premiere that she wasn't his kids' mother. After dedicating the entire final season to Mosby finally meeting his lovable future wife, Tracy (well-played by Cristin Milioti), the showrunners turned her into a footnote; the episode revealed Ted's series-long story to have been about how he never stopped loving ""Aunt Robin."" That’s a twist that might’ve made sense if How I Met Your Mother had only lasted a couple of seasons. But after nine years of asking the audience to care about the identity of the woman in the damn title, the sudden about-face wasn’t just jarring. It was enraging.""   And that write-up is only taking into account the Ted/Tracy side of it. It didn't even get into the Barney/Robin side of it, or their individual character assassination, or the misogynistic tone, or the many contradictions to canon. Just looking at the Ted/Tracy part alone makes the ending terrible writing. Taking in account all the rest, it's an absolute disaster of epic proportions."

HIMYM,376non,ImperfectSanity,3,Tue May 26 09:35:48 2015 UTC,"I'll take some downvotes with you, the finale was the perfect ending to the show.

HIMYM,376non,DoctorHypothesis,0,Tue May 26 02:32:13 2015 UTC,"I think the finale was fine however long the show may have lasted. It's all in the time-span of the finale. Eventhough the show had changed after nine years of development, there was still another 17 years until 2030, more than enough time to revert those changes.  Also, since the kids are told the entire story in one go, for them season 1 would be as fresh as season 9. Ergo, the finale works better when you binge watch the series."
HIMYM,376non,DoctorHypothesis,2,Tue May 26 16:33:42 2015 UTC,"What I found about the ending was it was just about life. Things happen, you can plan all you want, but unexpected events will take place. Then you just do whatever you can to keep surviving. I felt that's what the last episode, and in particular the final 10 minutes, was trying to say. No matter what life throws at you, you just keep going any way you can.   I really liked the ending. I wish it had perhaps been strung out over a few episodes and not condensed into just the final ep (with the rest of the season comprising the 48 hours of the wedding, cool concept but tough to execute), but felt it fit. I'm glad they didn't give in to pressure to change it. They had the ending planned and stuck with it (given some perhaps minor story fluctuations that may not have fit as well as one may have hoped lol...)"
HIMYM,376non,Ericws,2,Tue May 26 05:13:06 2015 UTC,"It's not a realistic ending,it's a fairytale ending for Ted and Robin. And to realize this perfect fairytale Ted/Robin ending,the writers killed a beloved character like Tracy and a beloved couple like Barney and Robin,only to permit their Ted/Robin couple,a couple that was dead at least since season 3,to come back together. That's not realistic at all,in real life Robin would never have been alone and miserable for years only to waiting for the moment Ted would be ready for her. In real life Robin would never suddendly fall in love again with Ted only because she see him happy with Tracy (and even if it's realistic..should we really route for her instead of Tracy who's his wife? I don't think so) we already saw trough the series that life wasn't perfect,so many sad events happened trough the seasons..we didn't need a crappy finale to see that ""life isn't perfect"". Also,tv shows darker than HIMYM like Mad Men or Dexter,had an happier finale than the HIMYM one,and this says all."
HIMYM,376non,RusVir,3,Tue May 26 08:00:37 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS (do I need to mention in a thread such as this? Lol...)  Well, I understand where you're coming from, and I'd counterpoint with another opinion of mine: I had mentioned I did feel the final episode (and the final 10 minutes specifically) was too condensed. Nothing really happened ""suddenly"" IRL (in the characters RL that is...), I forget the exact timeline, so I apologize for not being absolute here, but it's something like 6 to 10 years after Tracy's death that Ted remains alone and single and sad. There is plenty of time for ""life"" to happen to both he and Robin (Barney & Robin had been long over by that point too) before he asks his children's permission to ""try again"" with Robin. And I don't think we know enough about Robin's time in those years to say she ""waited"" for Ted or suddenly fell for him again. If I recall, she spends a significant portion of her life post-Barney traveling for her career? Rewarding for sure in many ways, but significantly lonely (just as Ted is). I think the final scene shows that they are both lonely, and both willing to gamble on just trying once again. We don't know if they make it as a couple (as our story ended here with this final blue horn scene), but I don't think that's the point...The point was that after all they've been through in life, after all the happiness and sadness both have been through, they're both in a place now to be willing to risk what they currently have (their friendship? I guess is the best way to put it...), and put their hearts on the line again, so to speak, to attempt to find happiness and companionship again. Will it be love? It might be, but that wasn't the point of the story, the point was they were willing to try...  So I guess my counterpoint is simply that none of that just happened. It took years for things to come about. The problem in my opinion was a lot of people felt THIS segment of the episode felt rushed (considering all the tiny little detail Ted put into his story for his kids leading up to Tracy's death, then he glosses over the next 6-10 years in a few seconds - perhaps because IRL the kids would now be aware of what happened since then, so there was no need for Ted to explain more, though it may have benefited the viewer). And I too felt it was a little rushed, but I believe that was the intention (and hey, I could be wrong of course lol!) of the story, and thus I loved the finale. Sure I felt there were missteps in some ways, but overall I feel like I ""got"" what they wanted to say about Ted and Robin coming full circle and trying to be together again. I dunno... I felt it was realistic enough (in so far as TV shows can be so of course haha!)"
HIMYM,376non,Ericws,2,Tue May 26 11:45:25 2015 UTC,"Perfectly written!  And that is exactly the problem- we watched 9 seasons of excruciating detail of his life, only to have the finale gloss over 10 years of his relationship/marriage to Tracy and basically skip 6 years post-Tracy, so that we as viewers did not ""feel"" that sense of loss, or what Robin had been through as an all-alone career-focused woman, to get them to that point of being ready to spend time together again."

HIMYM,374r4y,misselletee,7,Mon May 25 13:33:20 2015 UTC,"Theory 3: the kid is never mentioned because he/she is not important to the plotline of future events  Sure, it's nice that Marshall and Lily had a 3rd baby. The reason why the first baby is a huge deal is because IT'S THE FIRST BABY, but also because the day Marvin was born, Ted and Robin reconciled. When the gang realized she was pregnant the second time, Marshall gave up his judgeship in order to go to Italy with Lily, and we eventually see the family of 4 on a terrace in Italy. The day everyone learned of the third pregnancy is the same day Robin and Barney announced their divorce.  In all of the cases, each pregnancy was used as a plot device, and though we never see or hear mention of the third child is because the pregnancy has served its purpose"
HIMYM,374r4y,Echo_of_Hope,2,Tue May 26 00:35:40 2015 UTC,Nice theories. I prefer the second one though. It sounds cooler

I understand the ""aww"" was a joke in nearly every instance, but they're also used to resolve no less than 3 dilemmas. I think they sensed it was bad after a while since it's not seen past episode 9 or 10. Good for subdued Barney and Robin! One of the few pop culture references is the knight judging Ted's choices for the night. It's 2013 in this universe, not 2013-2014. Any new references would seem dated... So I'm glad there's no Man of Steel references like season 8 doing Ghost Protocol.  First appearance of Anna Camp as Cassidy, a whiny clingy girl who's parents hate her and life in general is giving her a kick in the nards.  Oh is this the one with the priest? I think he was funny and brought out some schemes in Barney and Robin. Barn-mallow and Robin-pad.  Yikes... Both of these characters did do some bad things in the past. Feeling up bosses, cheating with SOs for each other, and 250 sexual conquests is enough to kill the Reverend... Literally.  Marshall and Daphne were actually funny. Not many people notice that this scene is the first imagine spot to use someone else's voice in their place since season 1. I think it was only done in ""Purple Giraffe"" and it's a great callback. ""YOU DIDN'T TELL HER? WHAT THE DAMN HELL!"" Oh right, ""what the damn hell"" is a new catchphrase that everyone seems to say. Ted must remember somebody saying it and applying it to everyone.  Surprised CBS let them do the scene where Ted is contemplating taking advantage of the poor girl for sex, but didn't. Got a real Animal House vibe (should the boy rape that drunk passed out chick). Glad they both made the right choice.    In the spirit of me catching up on the rewatch, I'm also going back and doing facts for the episodes I missed."
HIMYM,377ho2,Mark_Zajac,1 point,Mon May 25 15:14:13 2015 UTC,"the knight judging Ted's choices   This is the episode in which Daphne and Marshall role-play defense of his unilateral career move. “He chose… poorly,” was the old Knight's haunting refrain. Was that verdict just for Ted?      Ghostly visitation is a recurring motif from from ""One Hundred Years of Solitude” (OHYOS) by Gabriel García Márquez.  Several plot points from HIMYM were borrowed from this book, which also provides a doppelgänger for Jeanette Peterson.  So, it seems fitting that ""Sunrise"" featured Jeanette and three ghosts in the same episode."

HIMYM,375oiu,Auldstar,5,Mon May 25 02:30:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Sadly,the writers didn't care to characterize better Tracy,their only concern was to show that she was a nice person and that she suffered so much for the loss of Max,but besides that,they didn't go deep with her character. They wanted us to care about her,but at the same time they wanted to tell us that the story was about Aunt Robin and not about her...this is a big contractidion. Anyway,Cristin Milioti did a wonderful job,she is a great actress and if we love Tracy the most part of the credit goes to her."
HIMYM,375oiu,Domyfranky,4,Mon May 25 09:44:31 2015 UTC,"I think part of it has to do with the fact that Ted is telling all of these stories. His wife passed away and he probably know to never speak ill of the dead. Since he's telling it to his kids, he can't say that she had any problems or flaws or anything because he wants them to remember her as an angel. I love the mother, but I do agree that her character was way under developed. We didn't get a chance to make our own opinions of her with such a short amount of time and it's really upsetting."

HIMYM,375oiu,Ericws,4,Tue May 26 13:34:13 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong. She is definitely a flawed character in the sense that she's so perfect. I honestly think that has to do with the fact that the writers were trying to stick to the whole ""AND THIS IS HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER BUT HOW I'M TRYING TO CONVINCE MY KIDS TO LET ME FUCK AUNT ROBIN"" thing. That would've been find had the show ended six or seven seasons earlier but by the goddamned ninth season, the whole show had changed so much that they should've went with it. Season 8 should've been how he met her and season 9 should've been showing her development.   Season 9 was just so fucking awful. It makes me sad because this is one of my favourite shows. And season 9 has my all time favourite episode but even that can't make up for the terrible way season 9 was presented. This is coming from someone who loves the mother and will watch anything with her in it. Anyway, I agree with you. I don't like her characterisation, or lack thereof either. I just wish she had more screentime."

HIMYM,375oiu,ImperfectSanity,6,Mon May 25 17:06:42 2015 UTC,"The writers were going for perfect - which is why she had such little screen time. If she needed to actually develop it would showcase her flaws. It fits in the story because the narrative is being retold by her Husband after her death. The bad parts are intentionally glossed over (all the stupid fights, moments of jealousy we had etc...part of his speech).  Also I think the whole poverty thing ended up with her writing a childrens book about economics/business? Something along those lines.  The Barney meeting was pushing suspension of disbelief, but it made sense she met the rest of the gang on the wedding weekend. It was a small inn and they were all heading to the same location. Plus a few of her meetings lasted a minute or two. Brief, but memorable."
HIMYM,375oiu,aversion25,3,Mon May 25 19:49:47 2015 UTC,"It was cheesy for Tracy to meet all of Ted's friends   Other than the Barney meet I guess it was quite plausible - obviously very low probability, but still a slight chance because they were all headed for the same wedding.  The flashback episode with Barney was so contrived, played too hard with the fate thing, and made Tracy either a super-psycho-analyst or a presumptuous prick - this falls in line with your third point.  Right at the opposite end was Bass Player Wanted. One of my favorite meets. It had Marshall and Tracy mutually helping each other, with Marshall in fact helping her more. And it called out on a flaw she had - too nice.  Bah, ""too nice"", what kind of a flaw is that? You may ask. But believe me, I know a person who's biggest flaw is being too nice. She is an absolutely great  person, but I often have to ask her to stop being too nice. Being too timid, not being able to stand up for oneself, always trusting others too much. It's bad for the person possessing the flaw, bad for people close to them. Hell, you can't even argue straight with them because they are too nice.  I do agree when you say she wasn't given much time to develop. Considering she's dead, Ted can only glorify her. But amidst that, I appreciate the writers giving her at least one flaw.    u might say that her encounter with Mitch when she says she will ""end world poverty"" shows progression, but none of her later scenes show expansion on that idea.   She did write a book that could solve world poverty. Though I suppose that too was glorified by Ted, considering Tracy's response that he's the only one who says that."
HIMYM,375oiu,do_not_ask_my_name,2,Mon May 25 05:53:14 2015 UTC,"From my experience, I have seen widows and widowers speak so highly of their deceased spouses that they idealize them to the point of sainthood (even to the point of forgetting or changing their flaws to make them ""saints"").  If you consider Ted's story-telling 6 years after Tracy's death, in that light, her being made into a ""perfect being"" makes total sense.  Regarding her meeting all of the characters:  well, it's a TV show."
HIMYM,375oiu,Ericws,1 point,Tue May 26 13:37:05 2015 UTC,"She was the Deus ex Machina.  The unknown element that comes in from nowhere, ties up all the loose ends and saves the day to help the story be complete."
HIMYM,375oiu,stratdog25,0,Mon May 25 14:31:53 2015 UTC,"She was a special character who was intentionally kept rare and not characterized fully. The story was being told by Ted about his dead wife, so he only focused on her good qualities and what he liked about her and left out her flaws, making her appear perfect. Her screen time was kept minimum to emphasize that the story wasn't really about her - she was just the end point of it. Remember before season 9 happened, their plan had always been to show her only in the last episode where we just see her face and learn her name, no backstory. She wasn't meant to be developed as a full character, they just had to show how she was different from all the other girls Ted had been with that made her his soulmate.  About her meeting the others, I guess it was kind of cheesy but it was the best way to introduce her into the story before Ted meets her. And I think the meetings were all plausible. Barney has probably hit on every woman in New York, so he was bound to hit on Tracy sooner or later. She met Lily and Marshall on the way to the hotel, which may be a bit forced but surely possible. And she only met Robin minutes before her wedding where she was performing, not unlikely at all."

HIMYM,3730v6,Selcin,20,Sun May 24 11:52:22 2015 UTC,"Yes - it didn't end the show that people were watching! it was an ending that was designed for the show in season 2, not the show as it was. The writers had to unravel the characters and situations to make their pre planned ending relevant again. Everything that fans complained about - the Mother dying, barney and robin divorcing, barney reverting to a womanizer again, all that collateral just to make Ted and Robin happen again. Ridiculous!  I was disappointed with the ending because it nullifies all the characterisation and messages of the show building up to the finale.  All the voiceover reflections about love and moving on from robin - pointless. All the developments of barney's character maturing and committing to someone - pointless. All those times of saying Robin and Ted weren't right for each other - pointless.   i've never heard of a show's finale being so hated. Fans of the show have literally been transformed into haters of the show because of the finale. What a disappointment - so funny to think the creators didn't even understand their own show! i could have written a more satisfying ending.   P.S no one better give me any BS replys saying how the show was reflecting real life with the mother dying blah blah blah. what a load of crap! the show had robots vs wrestling and cockamouse and robin sparkles and ted having conversations with future versions of himself. it was a sitcom not a freaking John Steinbeck novel"

HIMYM,3730v6,PiratesWrath,15,Tue Jun 2 16:28:40 2015 UTC,It felt rushed for me. Still loved it though.
HIMYM,3730v6,tvwatcherguy,5,Sun May 24 14:22:17 2015 UTC,"I agree. They spent an entire season on a weekend, and the finale covered decades. Obviously this was done so the big twist would be revealed in the finale, but the pacing of the entire season feels off, particularly compared to the previous 8 seasons."
HIMYM,3730v6,haplessabandon,2,Sun May 24 17:02:27 2015 UTC,"The writers didn't know how to end the show for a while, I read an interview that was about that IIRC, that's why it was so rushed. All of that time spent on the wedding of Robin and Barney. Yes, it shows how Ted met Tracy but Barney and Robin were a joke, the number of episodes wasted on that wedding was ridiculous. Lily & Marshall are important and their wedding happened in like two episodes."
HIMYM,3730v6,nicksteron,2,Mon Jun 1 16:34:06 2015 UTC,"I've been rewatching a bunch of random episodes ever since the show ended and honestly I keep finding little bits and pieces all over that make me believe that the ending isn't so farfetched as some purists make it out to be. I'll admit they mixed in a healthy dose of gimmicks for storytelling purposes though.  I'm not gonna go into the whole 'real life' thing because this show has swung so hard on both ends of the spectrum that neither is justifiable on its own. In that sense the show is weak: there were a lot of deep moments that showed the true potential of the series and the finale definitely doesn't live up to it (or at least tries with little success). On the other hand this is a sitcom and a brilliant one at that.  The show for me has always been about timing in life (or lack thereof), especially with Ted always trying to steer the situation to his benefit, expecting some higher power to give him back what he put in, only to come up with awful results. I'm not talking just with relationships, but with his career as well. The rest of the characters at some point have also struggled with having an opportunity but either not taking advantage of it, failing miserably at it or realizing it's not what they wanted. That, to me, is the thread that runs through the show. A lot of events and dynamics end up not being meant to be for whatever reason, regardless of the character's willpower.  I think people are quick to jump on the 'Tracy didn't matter at all / he was in love with Robin the whole time' bandwagon, but I think that's an extremely superficial conclusion. Tracy mattered, a lot! She gave Ted exactly what he was looking for when, for once, he wasn't even looking. He could finally live that romance that he had been chasing throughout his life. The coincidence, the moment, the surprise... The perfect timing. But all the timing in the world doesn't guarantee everlasting happiness. Despite that, they both lived the relationship to the bone, had kids, were truly happy as long as they could. I think that Tracy did help Ted forget about Robin because they had truly fallen head over heels for one another. But it didn't last forever. I like to think that Tracy made Ted stop caring about 'the one', he lived it and could finally stop projecting his fantasies onto his romantic life.  As for Robin and Barney: they both tried so hard to grow out of who they were and it backfired horribly. They are the two most traumatized characters on the show. Both of their lives were built on denial. When they decided to get married, they were lying to one another and hoping nobody would notice. Note that I'm not saying they didn't believe in it. They truly believed this would put their past behind them. But it wasn't meant to be. Barney had to go back to his old self to make a mistake to really change. You might not agree with the writers going down that path, but I see it as coherent with the overarching theme. The fact that the entire last season unravels at the wedding is a bit of a gimmick and a bit of misdirection: sure it's about Barney and Robin, but everyone else is deeply affected during those 2-3 days in more ways than one. The wedding is just a pretext. Once again, saying it was all for nothing is extremely superficial... There's a lot going on with every single character.  Throughout the series Robin and Ted tried to make it work as lovers, friends, roommates, they did everything they could to be together and help each other one way or another. But other things would get in the way, sometimes themselves. I'm sure Ted wanted to get over Robin but for some reason he never could, or maybe he did until Tracy died. Besides, let's not forget the whole story is being told through Ted's eyes; he's an unreliable narrator. He needed to hear it from his kids that this whole story had an obvious underlying motive (unbeknownst to him? I think so), to shake him out of his loneliness and realize he could try again with Robin. He needed someone to tell him it was time.  So yeah, maybe it could've been handled differently and there was a lot to work with, but I honestly don't think it's as awful as some people say. Personally I think there's a lot more going on than Ted being in love with Robin for 9 seasons."
HIMYM,3730v6,ristoman,6,Tue Jun 2 20:27:36 2015 UTC,"The majority of the fandom still hates the ending and they'll always do,because it was disrespectful of the charachters that we loved. CB and CT used an obsolete 2006 script,and reverted the character to where they were back on season 2. That finale completely ignores all the events happened between season 3-season 9,especially the events regarding the Barney/Robin relationship. They really thougth that people would not have noticed this? They were disrespectful of their own fans,and now they are paying the price.

They tried to compress over a decade of important character development into 1 hour. Something they wouldnt have had to do had they ended it earlier. And if they kept it going a bit longer then that story could have been fleshed out properly.   They shouldn't have spent the last season so heavily at the wedding. I was hoping for the season to be about 50% present, 50% flashforward. Would have given them alot more to work with.  It's a good story, poorly written."
HIMYM,372nxq,keremy,7,Sun May 24 08:07:35 2015 UTC,"In the span of mere hours, Tom goes from being devastated by his divorce to making jokes about how bad marriage is to crying that he can't have his wedding ring. That was one of the biggest complaints of season 9: wild mood swings in the span of 3 days.  Loretta half-naked... ewww. Final appearance of Stuart and Claudia. Surprised they ended on the note of Stuart being a complete asshole since the role is usually delegated to Claudia. They're both still alcoholic and probably raised a toxic environment for Esther. Esther. Loved the gift plot because of the sheer amount of callbacks they did. Stuart stealing it was pure genius. Though Ted getting Barney and Robin multiple gifts... Dude, you just said nothing was weird between you and Robin. Give it a rest.  This plot gets an exciting conclusion in ""The Lighthouse""... Three episodes later. I do enjoy Marshall's soliloquy about Gazzola's considering how terrible it is. It's basically an extended callback to the Amadeus reference in season 4's ""Best Burger in New York.""   My apologies for being gone and letting the rewatch slip (even though I said I wouldn't). I've been busy getting settled into summer and overall just burned out on the show in general. I've taken a break from watching it, and have been going purely off memory (which is why the facts seem kinda sucky)."

I'm a pretty big fan of HIMYM as well and it's had its own effect on my life. I was never the kind of person who felt much of a connection to people. In that regard I'm kind of your typical redditor. I tend to think that people are lying to me or that people in general are somewhat less than good. Even as I write this, it occurs to me that your whole story could be fabricated, but, on the chance it's not, a little of my kindness might go a long way.   When I started high school, I started with, quite literally, no friends. It wasn't that I was a loser or that I couldn't get along with my peers, it was that I could never seem to form more than a superficial bond with people. It was never anything more than the basic niceties that we're all taught at a young age. Being a teen, in the angsty way that teens think, I was convinced that I was just the kind of person who would never have real friends. It didn't sadden me too much because I felt like it was an answer to a question that I'd been pondering my entire (what I felt at the time to be quite long) life.   One day in gym class, it was decided that we would stay inside with the other classes (block scheduling meant that the there was more than one gym class being held at the same time) and have a sort of free for all gym day. Volleyball nets were set up, goal lines for hockey taped down, and a whole rack of basketballs brought out. It was my choice to just walk around the gym doing laps. I was never really good at sports and I hated going through the selection process for the team sports, so this seemed like the perfect choice. Ahead of me, while I was walking, was a group of people who I only really knew by name. We were friendly enough, but I would not have called them more than acquaintances that I'd happen to know for awhile. Among them was a guy I'd not met before. I'm not by any means anti-social, and since they were coming towards me, I figured what could be the harm in introducing myself.   So I did just that. He replied in kind with a sort of genuine warmth that I had never encountered before. It was refreshingly new. Now, it could be that it was entirely in my head, or that I've fabricated the memory of this feeling in the almost ten years since the time; but it was not a day that I will forget any time soon. The man I met that day spent the next four years of his high school career having to deal with me as his best friend (or him as mine, but let's not get into that.) Through him, I met dozens of new people, some of whom I call friends today. He also introduced me to my first real girlfriend. That didn't end well, but what first love does?  I don't really have a point here, I know I'm not a particularly good writer, and I'm not sure why I picked that story anyway. But, right now, the man who I call my best friend on this planet is moved 3000 miles away from me on the other side of the country and I miss him more than I would care to admit to a bunch of strangers on the internet. But he's coming back to me in time, and looking forward to that day brings me a lot of joy. He's the Marshall to my Ted and I know we've got a bond even better than you could see in a TV show.   I know how scary life can be. As, I'm sure, do you. I cannot imagine what it must be like to have your own flesh and blood attempt to take her own life, but I can imagine the relief you felt the one and only time you were glad to see your daughter fail at something.   I'll leave you with my favorite quote from the show. It isnt really relevant to your situation, but I'm not going to lie and pass off another as my favorite. It's from the episode where Ted has a chance to get Maggie, the perfect girl next door. ""If you're not scared, you're not taking a chance. And if you're not taking a chance, then what the hell are you doing anyway?"""

To dad - you earn a gold star for reaching out to the community and sharing your story. Thank you.   To daughter - like you, I have been captured by the personalities of HIMYM. At times, I feel much more connected to the characters of the show than I do to others on the real world because these people are just so incredible. But I have to say that you must also be incredible to truly empathize with these people and consider them a part of your life. Like Ted, you are willing to love and experience heartbreak, but be resilient enough to take a chance again. Like Robin, you are independent, headstrong, and bold. Like Lilly, you have the ability to laugh and cry with the people you love. Like Marshall, you hope for the best in others - and the best in yourself. Like Barney, you will find the fun in life. I hope that you know there's a reason that these characters have the power to speak to us and affect us more deeply than others can imagine. At the end of the day, it's because, like you and I, they are just trying to make the best of their days and to cherish the moments they can spend with each other. You clearly have an incredible father who loves you dearly, and I can only imagine that there are many others who feel the same way he does. Allow those people to enter your heart just as Ted, Robin, Lilly, Marshall, and Barney have. Embrace that. And share it with others. Much love to you and your dad."

Wisely, the ancient Greeks had four different words: “eros” (carnal love), “philia” (brotherly love), ""storge"" (parental love) and “agapé” (abiding love).     As befits the hero, Ted finds love in every possible form, leaning to agapé with Tracy and leaning to philia with Robin. His kids have storge covered, even for Robin: ""Dad, we love Aunt Robin!"" In a gross devaluation of the word, I loved it!"

I'll never fully understand the magic of film and TV, even when it looks like crap.  Marshpillow 2.0 was great to bring in because it allowed not only a physical presence of Marshall, but it allowed Lily to vent to it when she really needed to later on.  Barney has every right to be mad at Ted, but they also don't bring up the Robin of it all like /u/rosetattoo says; much like the Ted/Barney feud after Barney hooked up with Robin in season 3, nobody ever lashes out on Robin for doing the same shit Ted or Barney do. Robin even pointed it out in season 3. Robin's new hockey friend would have been cool to have around! I've met hockey loving girls, they're fun to be around. But why does Lily destroy the friendship forced by Robin's hatred of women? Well, she's Robin's psycho... And still has a seriously repressed sexual attraction to Robin that's never criticized or portrayed as wrong for the whole series. This isn't Phil Dunphy ogling Gloria Delgado from a distance, she is near-willing to leave Marshall (or make an open relationship) just to hook up with Robin (which, by the way, has already had two pecks)."

For Teddy Westside, it was years.   I like the ending for a couple reasons.    Everybody got what they wanted. Marshall his supreme court judgeship and children. Lily, her time in Italy and 3 children. Barney, had Robin (who he loved, they didn't fall out of love) for a bit and his child. Robin, got her career. Ted got his wife, kids, and eventually after time he got Robin. Robin was always his number two. ""There's no Top 5 Robin, there's a Top 1 and is you. It's always been you."" Ted ended up with someone we all loved. We had very little time with Tracy and to get to know her but she's basically female Ted.  Remember the driving gloves? The most important part, life isn't perfect. It doesn't always work out the way you plan. That lesson was told throughout the entire series. Robin not having immediate success when she moved to New York, up to the point of almost being deported. Lily with her art. Marshall's work life and him sacrificing what he wanted to do for the good of his future (working at GNB instead of environmental law, for some time). Barney with Nora. Ted with his career change. Tracy with Max.    Edit: spelling"

Robin had her career but honestly Bays and Thomas showed her always sad and alone (like in the party scene or the deleted restaurant scene) so i don't know...they said that she was happy with her career but actually showed us a sad woman. Barney had his kid,and he find happiness where he thought he could never find it...but,i still think that it would have been more sense if Barney and Robin tried another shot in 2020 or in 2030,considering that in the latest seasons they were always in love with each other..it would have been more sense than Ted and Robin,i think."

HIMYM,36l1vw,Domyfranky,1 point,Fri May 22 08:52:10 2015 UTC,"If you didn't understand the story it's not the writers fault. If it was about Tracey then she would have been in more episodes and referenced in Teds timeline, but she wasn't. She was only in about 6 episodes and probably had screen time of less that two episodes."
HIMYM,36l1vw,rose_tattoo,0,Fri May 22 10:27:50 2015 UTC,"The writers didn't understood their own story. Bays was stuck in his 2006 dream ending,the story evolved in a different direction in all this years but he didn't care,he wanted his Ted/Robin dream ending at any cost..and we saw the result. People got pissed,they've lost HIMYD and now no one wants to even produce their new show,let alone watching it."
HIMYM,36l1vw,Domyfranky,2,Fri May 22 10:42:07 2015 UTC,People were mostly pissed because it was poorly executed not because of the content.
HIMYM,36l1vw,rose_tattoo,0,Fri May 22 13:41:02 2015 UTC,it's the same thing if you think well about it.
HIMYM,36l1vw,Domyfranky,2,Fri May 22 16:56:11 2015 UTC,"It's not the same thing at all. You're saying that people hated her dying and Ted and Robin getting together, well a lot of people would have been ok with that had it not been rushed. Tracy wasn't an obstacle it was just that her story had finished, Teds hadn't."
HIMYM,36l1vw,rose_tattoo,5,Sat May 23 02:39:22 2015 UTC,"What I think would've made sense: 1. Barney and Robin's wedding at the end of season 8, with Ted meeting Tracy as the finale. 2. Most of the season 9 flashbacks and two episode finale spread out over half of season 9, leading to Tracy's exit from the show. 3. The last half leading toward Ted and Robin, thus the finale (ie. the dinners the kids mentioned).   I've gone through the show multiple times since watching the finale, and while most of it leads up to the finale and makes sense, I still have difficulty with the last half of the last episode because it was too much development at once.  While I understand ending the show they way they did, even Josh Radnor expressed wishing they had even ten more minutes to develop it further.  Edit: Formatting"
HIMYM,36l1vw,Chouchouko,2,Wed May 20 05:59:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Story-wise, everything works. It was just poor execution."
HIMYM,36l1vw,LukaTheSecond,3,Sat May 23 21:43:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. They spent a while explaining why Ted and Robin wouldn't work, then threw it all away on that. It just sort of came out of nowhere. It was a good show, ignoring the ending. I'm still trying to find something to fill this HIMYM void so if you find anything, let me know"
HIMYM,36l1vw,LukeSkynoober,3,Wed May 20 04:54:26 2015 UTC,"himym extending to 9th season in the middle of 8th season sorta shifted the priority from robin/Ted, to robin/barney/Tracy. If they decided to end at season 8, we wouldn't have to waste time on the wedding and Tracy's backgrounds, and go straight to divorce, moving on, death, etc."
HIMYM,36l1vw,jiwon0522,2,Wed May 20 07:43:27 2015 UTC,"I took it so literally! I loved everything about this show and really enjoyed the ending! I took it just as the title says, ""How I MET Your Mother!"" That is exactly what the show did, Ted explained to the kids how he met their mother. The show was never meant for us to get to know the mom, just to MEET her. We met her and that was that."
HIMYM,36dlak,fratbro710,24,Mon May 18 15:23:52 2015 UTC,"I think I've said this before, but part of the problem with Lilly is that her flaws are depressingly realistic. Racking up mounds of credit card debt? Being the nagging one of the group but insisting they're the ones that hold everything together? And really Allyson Hannigan plays the character really well. I have trouble watching that episode where Lilly steals the baseball because it just makes me cringe. The other characters have cutesy tv flaws (Barney's womanizng, Ted's dorkiness, Robin's fear of commitment) so when you see a manipulative bossy person who reminds you of someone you've met in real life it really rubs you the wrong way.  Meanwhile, Marshal is absolutely perfect. He went to Columbia for law school, can go back and forth between being corporate counsel and an environmental lawyer pretty easily, and eventually becomes a judge. (I still can't get over the last season... feminism/equality in a relationship aside, you don't give up a judgeship to fuck around in Italy, why is this a debate????? and having it all was kind of a cop-out) He still makes time for his friends and comes to the bar every night, even when he has kids. He's close with his family, we all have feels when his dad dies. His only ""flaw"" is being too nice and Jason Segel is a pretty lovable guy. So then you see Lily's flaws, especially in an episode where she's fighting with Marshal (which is often, because how the heck else can you keep the married couple in the show interesting) and it's easy to dislike her even more."
HIMYM,36dlak,invaderpixel,6,Tue May 19 02:27:10 2015 UTC,"Marshall should have talked to Lilly before accepting the judge position. Making a huge move like that without talking to your partner is a bad idea.  I mean, I don't like Lilly either for all the reasons people have said ... but you can't just take a life-changing job when you're in a relationship with kids without talking to them first."
HIMYM,36dlak,InvaderDem,0,Tue May 19 13:48:31 2015 UTC,"Lilly is far from perfect for sure, but worse than Barney!? Nothing ""cutesy"" about him. Though HIMYM definitely doesn't support his behavior as opposed to Lilly's so...i guess you have a point."
HIMYM,36dlak,Furiousa,19,Fri May 22 00:36:02 2015 UTC,"When I'm in the wrong mood, Lilly ruins the show for me.  All of the characters have some deep deep flaws that over the course of 9 seasons I hoped to see become more resolved - but Lilly's issues bother me the most and seem to hurt the group the most. They accept her as she is, but I certainly couldn't."
HIMYM,36dlak,Slice_0f_Life,105,Mon May 18 19:03:26 2015 UTC,"Yo it wasn't even the last couple of seasons yo.

What a stuck-up bitch! Right from the start of the series. For shame."
HIMYM,36dlak,eiknarflol,19,Mon May 18 17:39:11 2015 UTC,Remember when she had Ted drive to the middle of nowhere to rescue her than left him stranded?

HIMYM,36dlak,kevster2717,44,Tue May 19 10:41:27 2015 UTC,I wouldn't hold it against her for breaking up with Marshall and establishing her individuality before committing to marriage and she puts effort into winning him back. but she definitely manipulative and intrusive in everyone else's lives in later seasons.
HIMYM,36dlak,ewewmjuilyh,19,Mon May 18 18:27:03 2015 UTC,"Nah it was just selfish.   Edit: I get the establish individuality thing, yeah.  When I first watched the series the thing that had me pissed the most about the whole situation was the way she just walks back into everybody's lives again. She never apologized for all hurtful things she did (at least not until later in the series) and she was just scared because she had nowhere to run after her art program failed in SF (that's what they call it there). She just expects everyone to be cool with it and that is the part that is truly selfish."
HIMYM,36dlak,eiknarflol,29,Mon May 18 18:55:32 2015 UTC,I still don't see how it's selfish to leave someone when you're not sure you want to get married

HIMYM,36dlak,kitcatkittycat,13,Mon May 18 23:51:09 2015 UTC,"Don't get why you're getting downvoted man - I agree with you. Yes, it was shitty of her to leave Marshall, and yes, she probably could have found an equivalent program in New York as Ted says, but marriage is a big commitment. Despite knowing that you love the person immensely, being with one person for your whole life and sacrificing your dreams (Rome, although we didn't know that at the time) for a relationship to work is very important. You'd want to be 100% sure, and Lily wasn't, so the best thing for her to do was to work out what she wanted. Unfortunately for Marshall and Lily, their dreams weren't 100% compatible - Lily's wish to live as an art bohemian doesn't exactly meld well with Marshall's dream of saving the planet through an established law career. Telling Marshall about her dream to experience life independently wouldn't achieve that, as they'd inevitably communicate and be together, which was what she was trying to work out whether she wanted for the rest of her life. What Lily did was messy, and she could have handled it better, but she had no other choice if her and Marshall were ever going to work."
HIMYM,36dlak,faithhoven,6,Tue May 19 03:38:39 2015 UTC,"In a dream world Lilly would have told Marshall about the art program from the start. I feel like he would have been supportive of it and she could have gone to SF and maintained the relationship long distance. It would've worked, because despite how much we all hate her and how much she truly sucks, her and Marshall are pretty much perfect for each other."
HIMYM,36dlak,eiknarflol,2,Tue May 19 05:27:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly!! Lily didn't handle the situation well, but if it was a month before my wedding and I was freaking out, I don't think I'd handle it well either!"
HIMYM,36dlak,kitcatkittycat,15,Tue May 19 13:35:51 2015 UTC,"Except she could've gone to an art school in New York, she clearly wanted San Francisco to escape the marriage, not pursue her dream."

HIMYM,36dlak,platonic_spooning,45,Mon May 18 17:52:23 2015 UTC,"Yes! Even if you take out the fact that she's controlling and manipulative, Marshall is a mostly-successful lawyer who is so nice to everyone that Robin has to get on his case to speed him up.

HIMYM,36dlak,GingerStardust,21,Tue May 19 05:22:52 2015 UTC,"At first you think Marshall and Lily have this fairly tale relationship where they are happy. Everyone has kinda stated the SF thing, and the debt thing. Over the course of the show you find Lily getting more and more selfish, and Marshall's continuing to be selfless. One thing you forget about is that Marshall didn't want to live in the city after college. He was willing to give up the suburbs and moving back to his home town for her. Granted he ended up moving back to the city later. But still the fact remains that he was willing to give it up for her. The Rome thing struck a chord, because he wanted to be a judge, and their relationship was all about sacrifice in his part. Maybe Marshall should've talked to her about it, but still was incredibly mad about him choosing his dream because it would wreck her's. I was so happy when Marshall finally said something about the SF thing and instead of owning up to it, she freaked out and left. The only reason she wouldn't go to Rome is because she was pregnant and it would be too hard, not because it would be best for Marshall. Honestly until this thread I didn't realize I didn't like Lily, but as you go through out the series you find more and more not like about her."
HIMYM,36dlak,dylang92,14,Mon May 18 20:40:41 2015 UTC,"To the writer's credit, I appreciate when they would show these glaring problems and horrible deeds. My problem with the writers is when everything gets resolved a few episodes later with no lasting negative on the person who was horrible. When Ted almost cheated on Victoria, he lost both her and Robin for a long time. He had to take responsibility. But with Lily, she should've ended up divorced and alone."
HIMYM,36dlak,TheRealDJ,4,Tue May 19 01:06:06 2015 UTC,"That's not true. Lily said that the only reasonable solution was to stay in New York after Marshall got the judgeship, but it was Marshall who said that they should go to Italy because she was pregnant again and something about living her dream.   The reason why Lily was pissed was because he didn't discuss it with her and just made the decision by himself. She had no problem seeing that the judgeship was more important than Rome."

Better try to force myself back in his life.  I make no money as an artist? Better ruin my credit buying everything.  My husband wants to buy an apartment? Better hide my awful credit from him.  My husband wants me to sell my paintings to make up for my terrible credit? Better bitch at him about not supporting me and then fail at selling my paintings because I suck at painting and then become a kindergarten teacher and spend my days napping and giving time outs before coming home and bitching at my husband for going to law school and trying to save the environment and working long hours at the office. I don't like your girlfriends because I can't picture spending the rest of my life with them on some front porch? Better break you up.  Every character has their flaws, but what are Lily's benefits? Ted gives his apartment to Marshall and Lily and tells Robin to go marry Barney. Marshall always has Ted's back and puts up with Lily's shit. Barney pulls all kind of awful shit and then gets Lily to come back to Marshall, buys them a ton of crap for their wedding, doesn't propose to Robin without Ted's blessing and genuinely tries to improve as a person throughout the series. The only one who fucks up as much as Lily is Robin but at least she owns up to it. Lily has done so much fucked up shit and the worst part is how superior she acts toward all of her friends and every time when she gets caught on her bullshit her go to response is to blame someone else for her actions.  Ted gets so much hate for going back to Robin and being boring and complaining too much but Lily is a horrible friend and a worse wife.  Man, fuck dat bitch."

Especially the episode where she finds out Ted calls her a bitch for walking out on Marshall. I'm not saying she didn't have the right to leave, but she did it in a really really shitty way. Then she treated Ted like shit for calling her out on it in a rude but honest way.

Wanting to steal Zoey's scarf at the bar because she's against Ted building the GNB headquarters? Makes even less sense.   Then to take a stuffed Turkey from Zoey's apt because Zoey got mad at Ted and kicked them out? Again no fucking sense.   Taking a crystal ashtray from The Captain for...I don't think they really gave her reasoning then, did they? Even if there was one, still makes absofuckinglutely zero sense, when that night Ted and Robin both were huge embarrassments!   So yea. There's my thoughts on Aldrin Justice."

Setting aside the occasions where she is clearly in the wrong and gets away with it more easily than the others would (Where their transgressions would lead to multi-episode arcs, hers are often resolved within the episode), there are times like the argument between her and Marshall over how to coach basketball. The conclusion of the story, as stated (Unchallenged) by Lily is that ""[her] way isn't completely stupid...[his] way is completely stupid.""  Regardless of what you may think about Marshall's coaching style for the kids, Lily's style is at least as stupid as Marshall's, and Marshall's is merely too extreme. Lily's ""way of coaching"" is to not coach them at all. Marshall is at least teaching Basketball, he just needs to tone it the hell down and be  less aggressive. Lily's method won't teach them anything, and therefore is completely stupid. Despite that, even if the conclusion had been that neither way was completely stupid it would be fine.  Instead, Marhsall's method is dismissed as being clearly completely wrong with Lily's having some merits. Despite the fact that it's almost (And that's being charitable) the exact opposite of the truth. Why? Because Lily is never wrong.  It's ridiculous."

HIMYM,36dlak,MissRepresentation,21,Mon May 18 17:07:10 2015 UTC,"Let's see, the whole baseball incident, where she decided to punish a grown man the way that one would a child, and didn't even care that someone could lose their job over it, in fact she pretty much never admits that this was wrong. She apologizes that she could have put Ted's job in danger, but she couldn't give two shits about the random employees that were about to be fired. She didn't want to tell the man she was going to marry about being tens of thousands of dollars in debt even though once they got married it also legally became his problem. She also thinks it was her right to mess with Ted's ex's to end their relationships because she didn't like them. Regardless of how shitty the ex's were, that wasn't a her place at all, especially when her criteria involved whether or not she could picture them on a porch together. She also leaves Ted stranded in the middle of nowhere so she could go to an interview for the art program, and broke things off with Marshall. This wasn't just about Lily following her dreams either, because it's pointed out that there were similar art programs in New York and she deliberately chose one far away. On top of that incident, she steals all the Christmas decorations after finding out that Ted called her a bitch for the incident, even though 1. It would ruin Marshall's Christmas, when he had nothing to do with the incident, and 2. Ted was trying to get Marshall to cheer up over the break-up, and while calling someone a bitch isn't exactly nice, it was an extreme reaction to the incident.  I don't think anyone in real life would stay friends with her after all those things."
HIMYM,36dlak,theblackfool,16,Mon May 18 17:18:37 2015 UTC,"That's a fair assessment.   This is somewhat off-topic, but I'm guessing he calls her a cunt, not a bitch. They used the word bitch other times in the show without issue. I think the idea was that it was supposed to be pretty much the worst thing you could call someone (especially a woman), so cunt would make more sense than bitch."
HIMYM,36dlak,GumbandsNAt,5,Mon May 18 18:21:42 2015 UTC,"I'll dig around, but I'm pretty sure the producers confirmed it was bitch. I used to think it was cunt too, and I remember reading some article that changed my mind. That easily could have been them back-peddling too.  Either way, given the situation where she left him (and admits she was in the wrong later on), and Ted was trying to help Marshall get over her, you'd think Lily would be more forgiving. Especially at the expense of Marshall's Christmas, which he'd been working insanely hard for all day at law school so he could come home to it."
HIMYM,36dlak,theblackfool,9,Mon May 18 18:47:33 2015 UTC,"It just wouldn't really make sense though since bitch is one of the most commonly used swear words in the show and has been used other times uncensored. Even though the context of using it in casual conversation is different than if you're calling someone that word, I can't really see everyone reacting that strongly to Ted calling her a bitch. One of the reasons I think it was cunt, not bitch, is because Lily wasn't more forgiving. Her reaction indicated she was called something pretty extreme.   Remember that's Ted's little cousins who accidentally overhear also have never heard the word before since they ask what it is. Even though they are sheltered Christians, most kids that age have heard the word bitch somewhere before. Cunt would be more uncommon though, especially in the U.S...I probably had heard the word bitch used by age three, but I don't think I heard the word cunt until I was a teenager.   I don't know, maybe the producers did confirm it was bitch or at least hinted at that when asked. If you have the article I'd like to see it. But they could have gotten a ton of backlash if they ever publicly admitted it was intended to be cunt since Americans have their panties up in a huge twist about that word, so I would imagine that they would err on the side of it being bitch in interviews. Also, they've used more edgy stuff like that before but always kept the meaning elusive...just Google ""peanut butter jam joke.""   We'll probably never really know what they initially intended the word to be, and they obviously left it up to interpretation on purpose, so maybe they never even had a preference between the two words. It's all just speculation.   I agree that Lily should have been more forgiving though regardless of what the word was."

HIMYM,36dlak,kitcatkittycat,16,Mon May 18 23:54:23 2015 UTC,"Everyone on the show has flaws, that doesn't mean they would never have friends in real life. Barney lures away nanny candidates and sleeps with them causing his friends who are stressed about childcare to not have anyone to watch their new baby. Marshall runs away from his wife in New York, lies about his Mom needing him, and forces his grieving mother to care for him. Anything can sound bad out of context. People are flawed. The show isn't trying to show perfect characters."
HIMYM,36dlak,Labeled521,4,Mon May 18 17:50:58 2015 UTC,"Of course, and I still love the show and don't let my problems with the characters ruin the overall humor and feelings.

HIMYM,36dlak,GetLohh,2,Mon May 18 19:11:46 2015 UTC,"A lot of the reason I don't like Ted comes down to his views on relationships, because he takes the whole ""The one"" thing too far. He doesn't really learn anything from his relationships, and when they all fail he acts like it's just because they weren't the right one, without gaining any insight as to why. It's like he lives in a fairytale that only really works on TV. I don't think he's an unrealistic character because a lot of people think this way, but I do find it grating over time. It just doesn't ever seem like he puts real effort into working out the problems in his relationships."
HIMYM,36dlak,theblackfool,8,Tue May 19 10:00:20 2015 UTC,The whole debt thing with her clothes. Ruining relationships The whole Italy argument and how Marshall basically had no say in it. Her running away from the relationship to pursue selfish needs.   the list goes on friend.

Of course their journey will continue,but the Mad Men story ends there,we can only imagine their future but we should not see it,because the ""Mad Men story"" ends there. The characters will continue their journey,but is right for us to only imagine it......with HIMYM,instead,we continued to see their journey (even when the ""How I Met Your Mother"" story was finished) and we saw what we saw...storylines came out from nowhere,and some other unnecessary things.

HIMYM,36cpek,itdothstink,3,Tue May 19 14:34:27 2015 UTC,"How is it a mistake? In Himym, this is the very premise of the show! The story was told FROM THE FUTURE, so it had to end there with revealing what the situation is in 2030 and how the kids react to the story."
HIMYM,36cpek,Ericws,1 point,Tue May 19 16:51:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's because most viewers were unable to internalize the fact that there was going to be a 15+ year gap in the storytelling and weren't prepared to deal with it.  A lot of confetti can go down in that amount of time, and it did.  This is the fault of the creators for choosing to tell the story in such a way.  It's also a little bit the fault of the viewer if he/she was expecting some kind of happily ever after ending."
HIMYM,36cpek,RusVir,0,Thu May 21 03:45:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it could have ended like the alternative ending, with Ted just saying ""that is how I met your mother"", and the overall finale did not need to deal with Barney's/Robin's divorce, etc......"
HIMYM,36cpek,Ericws,2,Tue May 19 17:37:37 2015 UTC,That would feel incomplete. The alternate ending feels incomplete to me for this very reason. I always wanted to know what the kids would say after the story is finished.
HIMYM,36cpek,Ericws,1 point,Tue May 19 18:11:54 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I found what the kids said to be highly unpleasant at the time I watched the finale.  But I thought the alternative ending felt incomplete as well.

HIMYM,36cpek,rose_tattoo,1 point,Tue May 19 16:47:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know,i think the writers put themselves in this narrative trap...i know,it's a story told in flashback,so we had to come back in 2030...but at the same time,going forward with the future,showed us new storylines that we didn't see trough the 9 seasons of the show (Barney and Robin as a married couple who has a long-distance relationship,Ted and Tracy who gets sick in 2024) you know,it's almost like a new show,because the situation it's completely new,it's not the same gang anymore...i think that's one of the reasons why people didn't like the ending...it basically wasn't the same show anymore."
HIMYM,36cpek,rose_tattoo,2,Wed May 20 08:05:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.    In a way, the show became a victim of its own success.

I didn't hate her as much as everyone else did, but she was really aggravating to be around because everything she said was sassy. Some people hated her for being a bad actress, but this girl was good enough for 30 Rock so perhaps it's just a bad role.  First flash-forward of Ted's life with Tracy, which brings them back to the Farhampton Inn several times. Also, what's the volcano on Ted's crossword? Vesuvius. James got divorced, starting his arc of being messed up from it and casting off blame for his own promiscuity. First appearance of ""Thank you Linus."" Was going to have a counter for how many times it appeared, but that's too much effort for a joke I didn't find to be that funny. First appearance of Curtis, the clerk who takes pity on Ted despite Ted not wanting it. He does eventually become the ultimate wingman later on. The Stinson horniness curse. Not too many times does this season indulge in Barney's fantasies (presumably because the old sets could almost never be used and thus this season's budget was used on its main locations). Russian Barney and Russian James are great. I love Wayne Brady."

HIMYM,36274c,cormega,5,Sat May 16 05:58:30 2015 UTC,"First appearance of Cristin Milioti as The Mother. She doesn't get a full name until the series finale so even her boyfriend has to avoid using her name. She's pretty young compared to the rest of the characters, but is really delightful. Milioti's looks are what happened if Lily and Robin decided to put their genes into a pool. Milioti also appeared in NBC's A to Z and was a supporting actress in The Wolf of Wall Street as Jordan's first wife (in a perm!). Like her character in the show, she can also play bass. Did you know Farhampton isn't a real town in New York? I didn't. This is also where Victoria's botched wedding was going to be held.  The locket did turn up... Or did it? The contents of the gift(s) are in a future storyline. Ted's house is finally flipped... Just when he decides to move to Chicago to get over Robin. I know everyone got sick of his love for her, but come on, we've all been there once.  This is the one where Ted holds Robin's hand in the rain right? Or was it last week? Either way I was upset because I thought Ted finally moved on but then Robin was getting second thoughts. This is also a big season 9 conflict.  Marshall is a judge after being in St. Cloud for too long! (Final appearance of Minnesota). This directly contradicts the Rome plans Marshall and Lily were so excited for. Isn't it great that Ted and Lily are having scenes together because of Marshall's abcense? They're great and don't have enough individual time together. This is the one that made me notice how much Alyson Hannigan has aged compared to the rest of the cast, with liverspots and such when she used to be the youngest looking cast member."
HIMYM,36274c,consuellabanana,3,Fri May 15 14:04:42 2015 UTC,"I noticed Alyson's aging since ""Who wants to be a Godparent"". She looked significantly older and her belly fat was so obvious with the dress. Of course she's the oldest in the group, but I think it's also done on purpose because Lily just had a baby - that look is natural for any woman who just gave birth. In ""Sunrise"" of season 9, make-up helped Lily look in her late 20s again."

I don't think this was meant to be a laugh filled episode; much of it like every episode before their season finales is purely set up. Robin's locket is so strange for the character to focus on because she has hardly ever been the sentimental type unless it involves animals. She's always had a hidden girly side, so maybe it was just a bit repressed before it happened? They should have set this up better since it's one of the biggest Chekhov's Guns in season 9. Ted and Marshall and Lily? Inconsequential. Already been covered by that episode where Robin tells them to move on with their lives back in season 4."
HIMYM,35xzrc,gizmo1492,3,Thu May 14 18:54:31 2015 UTC,"Robin and the locket brought out aspects of Robin that are so unlike that it kinda bothers me that it became such a huge thing in the final season. It's understandable that there was likely some aspect of Robin that is an inner romantic, but it's used in a way to bring out a side of Robin that goes against what she's been like as a character throughout the series, and used as a clutch in the final season. Her freaking out and getting jitters makes sense, but her using sentimentality as a sign to determine who is ""the one"" for her just seems to go entirely against Robin's worldview. This episode even points out the very notion of a locket is very not like the Robin we've grown to know for 8 seasons at this point."

HIMYM,35vrzj,btrpo,0,Wed May 13 22:39:56 2015 UTC,"Sigh..if only Tracy did have some kind of profound last on screen conversation with Ted, maybe even suggesting he move on and find someone else after she's gone, maybe then the ending may have been easier to accept among fans rather than what we have now where fans who were so bitterly disappointed that they never fail to mention the finale on the himym Facebook page."
HIMYM,35wk24,Hamstreak,2,Thu May 14 02:42:21 2015 UTC,"I had this idea too, but I came to find out that it wouldn't work. If you compress the show into 2 hours it would have to be focused entirely on Ted and Robin and leave out Barney, Marshall and Lily's arcs. And the result would just be a typical rom-com. If you try to squeeze in all of their stories and all the gags then it would feel very rushed and jarring like the finale. So two hours is too short a cut, it would have to be much longer. Maybe a trilogy of three 3-hour movies?  But here's what you can really do that would work - make season 9 alone into a movie. With its slow pace set over a weekend it already feels like and is best to watch like a movie. So you could cut out all the fillers and compress the 22 episodes into an hour and a half followed by the finale."
HIMYM,35wk24,RusVir,1 point,Fri May 15 19:34:00 2015 UTC,"I really recognized how it really can't work as a movie, the sense of long waiting cant be matched by a simple movie. The years of the show actually help emphasize the point that this is a LONG and arduous search for ""the one"". That Trilogy Idea sounds interesting though, focusing on 3 ""eras"" in Ted's life. Sadly a trilogy has it's own problems, like how are they gonna handle being good on their own? A movie has to work well on it's own regardless of the other pieces of the puzzle. How does the second movie work, it's a bit hard to see the second movie as nothing but filler for the third.   Still love the idea that this might work as a movie if done right, even with the liberation of an extra hour and three movies to do it."

HIMYM,35wk24,Echo_of_Hope,1 point,Thu May 14 20:04:23 2015 UTC,"We can try to make it into a 2 hr movie but we may have to omit a few running gags of the series such as the slap bet and please. We might have to focus more on the last 2 seasons especially the 9th one. take scenes of how ted met robin,zoey and stella. The rest can be given just a couple of minutes. we can skippen robin and barney's first break up and show how they get engaged, married and divorced. I guess we should show a little more of ted-robin to hint to the audience that they are end game. Lily and marshal can be shown having their big moments. In the end you won't know how importance can be given to each character unless you make the movie but it can never do justice to the show"

HIMYM,35tf86,rose_tattoo,2,Wed May 13 13:07:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's a little more complicated. Tracy thought she would never be able to love anybody else, until she met Ted. Ted pined for Robin because he thought she was the ""one"" but that changed when he met Tracy. In the end, after having lost the real ""one"", he learns that it's ok to find happiness again with the ""almost one"".  They cleverly told us next to nothing about Max, so we don't know if Tracy loved him more or Ted."

HIMYM,35tf86,GL96,1 point,Thu May 14 17:49:28 2015 UTC,She said that because she had ended up with him. But I don't think it reflects what she thought of him in comparison to Max.
HIMYM,35tf86,RusVir,3,Thu May 14 21:17:41 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  I think they both thought they had lost ""the ONE"" (Max and Robin), only to learn that there IS NO ""ONE"" love.  Maybe a great love, and you hope you end up for the long haul with that great love, but there is not just a ONE."
HIMYM,35tf86,Ericws,1 point,Thu May 14 15:30:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think Ted ever gave up the notion of the ""one"". He agrees with Klaus' idea of lebenslangerschicksalsschatz. Before he met Tracy he just believed Robin might be that ""one"" and she got away. After meeting Tracy he knows for sure she is the actual ""one"" and still believes that in 2030 - he will always love her till the end of his days and beyond, even though he moves on with Robin. Here he doesn't see Robin as a ""one"" again, but just settles with her to be happy again.  In Tracy's case I think it's not clear exactly how she felt about Ted."
HIMYM,35tf86,RusVir,1 point,Thu May 14 17:22:10 2015 UTC,That's fair.  I'd agree with that.

Ted did invite Robin to his wedding, but she didn't respond, Tracy was the one who gave the invitation that Robin accepted.  In both cases it was not an ex that invited an ex to their wedding, it was their partner.  The lesson is really, “unless your ex is also important enough to your partner that they want them there too, inviting an ex drives a wedge with your partner to be on the day you are supposed to be married.”  But that isn't as concise."

I wonder if the fact that Bays/Thomas wasn't given writing credits and therefore probably didn't provide as much input as they would have in episodes they were credited in was the reason."

She was in 14 episodes of HIMYM, one of which focused entirely around her. So 20+13(averaging a minute per episode), and that's about 33 minutes, but it really depends on how much time was focused on her in each episode which I'm not sure about. That's as far as I'm going.

They replace bogart' name with another famous Italian actor because nothing translates to bogart in Italian. Also, when Lily is being comforted in Italian, he just keeps repeating that sentence and changes inflection. Due to telepathic conversations, they know what the other is saying. Aww. This is the foundation to the conflict that lasts throughout season 9, though it's all sunshine and rainbows right now. Yes, if you google the girl she has a ridonkulous body. I think CBS avoided showing it because just showing her majesty would be considered too hot for network TV. Ted is absolutely right: while Robin is much more of a bro and will support him in much of what he's doing, Barney has to know that Robin has her limits. When Ted rightfully calls him out on it, however, Barney coldly calls him out for caring too much about her in what is the matrimony of Barney and Robin, not Ted and Robin. Ghost Protocol is the last big topical reference I see in the show, thankfully. One of the good things season 9 did was keep their pop culture references to a minimum and more timeless. Not talking about the newest Mission Impossible for instance, but Indiana Jones and stuff."

HIMYM,35ed0c,Domyfranky,8,Sat May 9 16:07:14 2015 UTC,"This episode its great, and had me in tears at the end of it. I was sure the mother was dead after watching this episode. I also loved Marshall and Robin's fight for the cocktail.  Here!    Best quotes of the episode:    Ted: ""Hi. I'm Ted Mosby. In exactly forty-five days from now, you and I are gonna meet. And we're gonna fall in love. And we're gonna get married, and... we're gonna have two kids. And we're gonna love them and each other so much. All of that is forty-five days away. But I'm here now, I guess, because I want those extra forty-five days. With you, I want each one of them. And if I can't have them, I'll take the forty-five seconds it takes before your boyfriend shows up and punches me in my face. Because... I love you. I'm always gonna love you. 'Til the end of my days, and beyond.""  Marshall (to robin):  ""oh and you think you can step up to me? You think you could step up to the streets? To me? You think you could step up, over me, to the streets?"
HIMYM,35ed0c,mikeavb,21,Sat May 9 16:17:27 2015 UTC,"This episode went from 0 to 100 real quick. I thought the plots were funny but unusually inconsequential. The ending sequence shows why it's like that and it was ballsy and depressing and wonderful. For the Longest Time! Favorite technical detail that leads to foreshadowing: when Robin and Marshall go to the booth, where are Future Ted and Barney? Gone.  Marshall acts especially goofy and doesn't act like himself... Is this what Ted thinks Marshall is like? ""Present"" Barney's jokes about his wives... At least they're wives now! The Minnesota Tidal Wave/Robin Scherbatsky is awfully high in sugar, isn't it? Robin's bathroom wall thing was also extremely detailed for someone who'd been gone for about a minute.  What is Carl's last name? Dude, it's McClaren! It's confirmed in season 9 as it's stated to be a family business. Jayma Mays returns as Coat Check Girl from way back in season 1. I presume Mays showed up because she was promoting The Smurfs 2 with Neil Patrick Harris. But it did bring up the central conflict in Ted: you didn't call her seven years ago, and your love life is a complete failure, why even bother trying? This episode also reveals Louis, The Mother's boyfriend at the time. Season 9 gives him a much greater role and a bit of a backstory.  First episode to blatantly foreshadow a). When Ted met the mother and b). The possible fate of The Mother. Fans like me believed at the time that she could have been dead based on Radnor's monologue, which had real tears."

Because of the special design for plastic, this product is marketed for plastic, but can in fact be used on any regular surface (wood, metal, etc).  That being said, it's usually sold at a higher price point because of the plastic compatibility. People are stupid and should buy the slightly cheaper, regular blue paint. Generally $1 less.

HIMYM,35b330,Scapone22,1 point,Sat May 9 15:40:27 2015 UTC,Yup I understand all that but it is also true that the most appropriate spray paint for a metal surface is not paint designed for plastic.

HIMYM,35akh3,jelatinman,3,Fri May 8 14:23:21 2015 UTC,"Marshall, Lily and Ted all get addicted to ""Woodworthy Manor,"" and is one of the few times that the show blatantly goes off something pop culturally relevant and makes a plot out of it. It may seem dated but because it's placed in 2013 it's okay because the show was crazy popular then. Other shows don't have good excuses for it.  Normally IMDb is fine but that seriously is a bad plot summary. Marshall would never cheat on Lily. The Ho-Be-Gone system (patent pending) is a weird gag. It's obviously an exaggeration by the writers because a). apartments aren't designed like that b.) because Robin gets out without any notice. Also if Barney killed people it'd make him bad (though he may have sold a woman, which I doubt). The Jor-El hologram returns, and it's really the only funny thing in the episode.  Who knew being an art collector was so demanding? Granted Lily is probably making a shitload of money but it's still odd.  I just don't like it that much; it's kind of a bottle episode since most of it takes place at Barney's and it's not written very well. Marshall and Ted as a gay couple, really?"

I felt the same about Scrubs and its ending, when JD watched the ""movie of his life"" on the hanging banner as he left the hospital.  That satisfying ending unfortunately did not happen for me in HIMYM.  I think it was because I personally wanted a bit more of a glimpse into the happiness of ted and Tracy.  Just a bit.  It could have helped me feel that closure as a viewer.  But, as I have said to domyfranky before, we are all right- this is opinion, and our reactions to what we read/watch/hear are our own."

The truth is: that finale could have been good back in 2006 when they (Carter Bays,because Craig Thomas in that occasion was only a ""yes man"") wrote it,but after all those years,it just didn't work anymore. But you know,Carter Bays it's a very nostalgic person (like Ted) and i also think he's a sociopath,so he can't let something go. I think that he had a crush back in college and she never wanted him,but today he still thinks that ""she should have been with him"" because he is ""the best man"" and things like that..so he wrote this ""wet dream ending"" when the woman of his dream says ""it was a mistake to being with someone else,i should have been with you"" and he is the hero of the situation than gets both the girls...honestly that's a little creepy.

But I think this was a subtle clue showing that Barney couldn't change and escape his ways, as another episode has him pass his teachings onto young boys, The Bro Code is extremely popular and how Barney in general just sucks at relationships. Jeannette is still crazy! She trashed Ted's place (Quinn's?) and blew up the Playbook with a bazooka. She's about as good of a cop as Chris Dorner was. Ted's desperation is better here because it's not sadsack in the forefront and whining. Ted can be desperate but it's either a melancholy loneliness or just something subtle (i.e. why this plot happened in the first place). Marshall's Skittles thing was funny but was probably the exact thing Jason Segel was complaining about when he got sick of sitcom hijinx. ""Oh my God, I have to have these Skittles. WHOOPS!

I was fairly certain before that that was what was going to happen but after this it's basically slapping you in the face.    Though their story telling seemed really out of place too.  Why would you not remember telling such prominent stories in each other's lives?  That's not something you forget.  I was for a few moments concerned Ted might have Alzheimer's disease after that scene.  I found it to be fairly poor writing.  I understand the need to get the characters to share their stories but another way would have been better imo.

HIMYM,35185z,rose_tattoo,1 point,Wed May 6 15:43:24 2015 UTC,That didn't have the kids pre-shot. It's pretty clear what the ending was meant to be the whole time.

HIMYM,35185z,ThisDerpForSale,7,Wed May 6 14:24:52 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess it comes down to the following:   Tracy had told Ted about Max, and Ted managed to have enough self-control to not ruin the relationship right then. Hence, why he waited 2 years. Then, while they were planning the wedding (so Ted did intend to marry Tracy a lot sooner than he eventually did,) Tracy announced she was pregnant with Penny. Then, life got in the way, and it didn't seem as necessary as Ted had insisted upon for most of his 20s/30s.    I guess Tracy just matured Ted enough that the most important thing they had was each other, and not a ring or marriage certificate."

HIMYM,35185z,AsianKitchenGuy,13,Wed May 6 17:43:31 2015 UTC,Show got so dumb at the end.

HIMYM,35185z,AsianKitchenGuy,23,Wed May 6 17:45:25 2015 UTC,Season 9 was the worst season by far. SO much time wasted. They clearly were stalling to make more money at the behest of the network.
HIMYM,35185z,RizzoFromDigg,0,Wed May 6 18:04:39 2015 UTC,"Watching every week not know what was gonna happen next, I liked it. But to me, the finale just threw everything they built up to away."
HIMYM,35185z,AsianKitchenGuy,9,Wed May 6 18:14:20 2015 UTC,"But how many episodes were pointless, and devoid of story?  How many episodes of pointless wedding shenanigans that didn't go anywhere did we sit through? Stupid Barney plans that were totally implausible.   We missed out on really getting to know the mother as a character because they spent the whole season on that crap.  They could have plotted better and it wouldn't have felt so cheap when they killed her off."
HIMYM,35185z,RizzoFromDigg,2,Wed May 6 18:17:09 2015 UTC,"You do bring up some good points, and Season 9 is not without it's flaws, that's for sure. But the episodes felt more like they were focused on the individual episode rather than a whole overarching plot which I loved, I mean Barney IS stupid and his plans ARE implausible one of the reasons I started watching was because he'd go on legendary adventures that were far too stupid for his own good, like the Murtagh list!    But again, you make some good points, I'd have liked a few more episodes where it shoots forwards to when Ted and Tracey are together already and he's telling her a story, instead of most of it being crammed into the finale."
HIMYM,35185z,AsianKitchenGuy,2,Wed May 6 18:36:27 2015 UTC,Barney's stupid plans were made much more implausible when you remember the scale of the episodes they were in.  If we grant that he has unlimited time and money to do what he does (Which isn't unreasonable) then it's okay when he decides to do the Murtaugh List. He's got nothing else going on that week.  The same goes for getting a makeup artist to dress him up as an 80 year old man for a complicated pickup routine.  But in the wedding episodes he had 6 or 7 ridiculous plans and they all came together in a day or two. That's just too much. It's impossible. It strains the show beyond ridiculous into Flanderization territory.
HIMYM,35185z,Gefen,2,Wed May 6 18:42:53 2015 UTC,"You just have to look at it from a different light. I know it has a lot of imperfections but sometimes you just have to look past them, and I'll always have a soft spot for HIMYM. And besides after seasons 6 through 8, which sucked pretty horribly at times, it makes season 9 look that much better."
HIMYM,35185z,RizzoFromDigg,1 point,Wed May 6 18:54:05 2015 UTC,There was never intention of showing in details their life together. So you can't really blame the last season for wasting time on road trip on account of Tracy and Ted wedding honey moon (or something).

HIMYM,352f2z,jelatinman,3,Wed May 6 15:18:08 2015 UTC,"I find this a much better version of ""The Burning Beekeeper,"" in which one single story is shown through three vantage points. Ted and Robin's points are skewed because Ted got baked while Robin was drunk as anything. When I first watched this I really did believe that The Captain wanted to do Robin because her story made the most sense. Revealing her to be drunk made the story even funnier. Boats Boats Boats! How did Becky go from respected journalist (by everyone but Robin) to commercial starring D-lister (which lets me bring up the greatest failure Robin has ever had) all the way to a random image in Ted's head? Becky does reappear in the show one more time in season 9's ""Daisy."" Lily just up and quits her kindergarten teaching job without a second thought to become an art scout, The Captain's plan for her all along. This is her final job of the series, kickstarting the main Marshall and Lily drama for the rest of the series. I always wondered how Lily got away with leaving her job for kindergarteners. Would the children be sad she's gone?"

HIMYM,352f2z,gizmo1492,2,Thu May 7 03:01:53 2015 UTC,Aldrin Justice in general is one of the dumbest things in the whole show. It makes her a great character but man is she an unlikable one.
HIMYM,352f2z,Domyfranky,3,Thu May 7 03:58:27 2015 UTC,Here's something I've noticed. This episode was written by Bays/Thomas. Something that I've taken heed during these disucssions is how much more Ted/Robin are in sync and see how much more Barney acts like a sleaze and notice how not in sync Barney/Robin are.  Ted/Robin shutting down Barney in unison as he tries to shoehorn his way into the crazy story and then coming up with a lie together to make Barney feel better is something I would add to the Ted/Robin are compatible list. Doesn't help that Barney's bragged about the hot chick he banged at the end of the fake story and her even hotter sister even though he's going out with Robin.
HIMYM,352f2z,TotesMessenger,1 point,Thu May 7 04:52:17 2015 UTC,"Right. I see this difference too,in the episodes written by Bays/Thomas the Ted/Robin relationship it's always put in a good light,and the Barney/Robin relationship in a bad light. Instead,in the episodes written by other writers is the opposite. So i really believe that only Bays and Thomas knew about the ending,because the differences trough the episodes are very big."

HIMYM,34x3ji,LittleHelperRobot,1 point,Wed May 6 01:06:14 2015 UTC,"Rent control in New York:       Rent Regulation in New York State takes the form of rent control and rent stabilization programs.  Each city in the state may choose whether to participate or not, and as of 2007 [update], 51 municipalities participated in the program, including Albany, Buffalo, and New York City, where over one million apartments are rent-regulated. In New York City, only buildings with six or more apartments are subject to rent stabilization.   In 1920, New York adopted Emergency Rent Laws, which effectively charged the courts of New York State with their administration. When challenged by tenants, rent increases were reviewed by a standard of ""reasonableness."" The definition of reasonableness was subject to judicial interpretation. Certain apartments were decontrolled beginning in 1926, and the Rent Laws of 1920 expired completely in June 1929, though limited protections against unjust evictions were continued.   New York's current rent control program, which began in 1943, is the longest-running in the United States. New York City is the only large city in the United States that has strong rent control laws.  From 1943 to 1950, rent control was administered by the federal government but has been administered by state government since 1950, although state and city agencies shared administrative work from 1962 to 1984.

HIMYM,34tqm6,jelatinman,3,Mon May 4 14:16:18 2015 UTC,This was really just a strange episode. I like the Robin Sparkles videos but to have a whole fake documentary on a character was kindof pushing it big time. It's awesome they got all those cameos but it also felt like a bit of a waste of their talent to say one line. Just more weird attributes to Robin's character  Also why would they ruin the whole Marshal Lily story like that? For the sole reason of justifying what Ted is doing by being a stalker? Had they seriously ran out of that many ideas at that point? Seemed totally unnecessary to make Ted feel better
HIMYM,34tqm6,ZDHELIX,1 point,Mon May 4 18:15:46 2015 UTC,It was an oddball that never got particularly referenced again outside of Jeannette. The Marshall and Lily story went back to normal after this episode and Robin Sparkles was not mentioned again until the finale's deleted scenes. It's like The Burning Beekeeper: it doesn't really have a purpose and felt like the writers spitballing ideas until something stuck.
HIMYM,34tqm6,TotesMessenger,2,Mon May 4 21:54:51 2015 UTC,"It's Robin Sparkles 4, y'all! This is the last time this chapter in her life is referenced in the series, unless you count the deleted scene in the finale. Much of the episode takes a break from its structure to show the ""Behind the Tunes"" MuchMusic special, with guests such as Paul Schaeffer, Dave Coulier and Alex Trebek (who somehow did not recognize Robin when she auditioned to be the coin flip bimbo in season 6). There's also no laugh track for extended periods of time. It was just a bizarre joke that really started to strain its credulity. First episode with Jeannette played by Abby Elliot, who is the daughter of the actor who plays Lily's father (Chris Elliot). While she is absolutely insane and the breakdown of her craziness is funny, she eventually becomes a pivotal character in the search for The Mother. I guess Lily is good crazy because she did find the love of her life; compared to what Jeannette does now, Robin did in ""Lobster Crawl"", Ted did in episodes such as ""Matchmaker,"" her scheme is relatively tame. It sucks they kinda ruined the meet cute they had established for 8 years though."

Carly is played by Ashley Benson of Pretty Little Liars fame. The scene in the club with the children is pretty accurate to when you outgrow things. Remember how excited he was to go to the club in season 1? Now it's just a relic of the past. There are some clubs that have 40 year olds regularly go though. Marshall and the gigantic baseball glove hand never fails to make me laugh. And how he was going to bang Lily one last time and immediately passed out. Great physical comedy there. For how silly Barney was acting it lead to a bigger truth: he no longer wants one-night stands and only wants Robin. Robin, honey, your fiancee is obviously more important than gifts. She was, however, exaggerating to make a point as the musical sequence showed us.   Good episode, I laughed enough."

They just thought it was obvious that Ted and Robin had feelings for each other, and didn't want to be an obstacle to what Ted and Robin could have."

It should have been more heartwarming and included more laughs in the years between 2013 and the ""present.""   ""Dad... You clearly have feelings for ant Robin.""  ""What, no I don't!""  ""Dad it's okay. I know how hard you've been taking her death. I've seen you look at the photo albums much more than usual. And she told us about the Max thing so she would want you happy. More than anything dad.""  ""But I just told this story which was short and to the point about your mother and how much she means to me!""  ""But she was barely in it...

Nothing is going to change and they gave everyone fair warning years ago that people may not liken the ending, but they kept with it and stood by their work.    they simply treated that show like useless garbage! CBS asked them to recast and to try another shot for the show,but they refused to do that because (Carter words) ""They needed to do something different"" so why did they accepted to do the pilot in the first place??    Do you have a link to that? I read they would have re-shot the pilot and re-cast if they got the order for 13 episodes which CBS refused to do. CBS didn't want to do it because they don't own HIMYD"

They all did a wonderful job with HIMYM,and i also said in the post that Bays and Thomas are still good writers (altough they are only ""good"" and nothing more) i simply said that i'm not a fan of them anymore,they disappointed me with their behavior. Can i be disappointed by them (and i'm not the only one) or have i to be considered a troll by you (i remember to everyone,the guy who always speak badly of Barney and said that he married Robin only to get revenge of Greg of GNB) only for this?

Carter tweeted : ""An easy narrative but 100% wrong. Himyd went away on its own merit!"".

I find the entitlement here to be so far over the top. You're upset because you didn't like XYZ and now you think it's their job to fix it. It's not, they are not beholden to you in anyway and they probably don't think it needs to be ""fixed."" You want a show that goes exactly the way you want? Make one."

ALL the showrunners speak with the press and the media,and cares about the relationship with their fandom. But i guess you don't know nothing about how those things works."

When it's focused on the big things it's great, when it's not it's very mediocre.  The jinx rant is fucking great, hilarious physical acting by Neil Patrick Harris.  Likewise, the first part was mostly done to set up Ted's inability to keep the secret that Barney will ""propose"" to Patrice on top of the WWN building. The Three Hackmigos may have worked if Seth Green wasn't at his Seth Green-iest. His style of talking and comedy in general just doesn't fit this universe... Though we did all know a guy like that growing up. And Marshall and Lily being assholes to him makes it all the funnier when he keeps the money. Ted's building is done, but you wouldn't have known it was still being done since the demolition waaaaay back in the season 6 finale. I actually forgot about the plot line until it came. Their workers are really fast, even the new World Trade Center took over 3 years to make.  The Pit thing was dumb. Robin should have been fired for her actions toward Patrice or at least reported to HR. But you're all here for the big thing: Robin gets proposed to by Barney in a long scheme devised by him, complete with fake-but-real confessions of love, security cameras showing him burning the Playbook, getting her friends to go along with it, and simultaneously get Ted's blessing for her to go chase after him. Oh Ted, how I feel for you. The unrequited love has gone on too long but Josh Radnor's pained expressions sell it every time.   Not bad overall, maybe a 7/10. I laughed enough, I felt for them, I hated Marshall and Lily."
HIMYM,34enea,ZDHELIX,3,Thu Apr 30 15:07:34 2015 UTC,"This has been brought up recently on here but seriously why did Barney propose on Ted's big architecture night? Yes he wants Ted's blessing but it didn't need to happen then. Plus Marshal and Lily barely showed up. I think that really piled on for Ted, the fact that his friend's got engaged and no one even showed up for him. Poor chap"
HIMYM,34enea,rose_tattoo,3,Fri May 1 03:36:20 2015 UTC,"If it really was about gettings Teds blessing, Barney should have told Ted what he was planning and getting Teds permission face to face. Instead it was just a series of manipulation and lies and screwing Ted at his biggest career event."

HIMYM,34enea,itdothstink,2,Sat May 2 03:56:50 2015 UTC,I feel like doing it then was the ultimate test for Ted because he had all the reason in the world to just leave things as they were and have Robin accompany him to the party.  The problem is that Barney is apparently unaware of Ted's desire to do the noble thing at all cost.  I thought it was worse that Marshall and Lily bailed so fast because Marshall was fully aware of what Ted was going through and he would have known what it meant when Robin didn't show.

HIMYM,34ac1e,gameryamen,15,Wed Apr 29 22:10:19 2015 UTC,"I was hoping they wouldn't reveal it myself, but big props to you for predicting it."
HIMYM,34ac1e,Sakheteu,8,Wed Apr 29 22:33:08 2015 UTC,"I think we all want to know, how did you figure it out?"
HIMYM,34ac1e,Harleequin,24,Thu Apr 30 00:09:04 2015 UTC,"It was a while ago and weed is legal in my state, so the details are fuzzy. But if I recall, Barney had a throwaway line when the gang was grilling him to figure out his job. I can't remember what it was, but something about the line tripped my foreshadowing alarm. From there I just asked myself what secret fits the hint, and got an idea that stuck with me about Barney being a professional fall-guy. It made enough sense that I ran with it, though even then I didn't catch the ""Oh, Pleas"" hint."
HIMYM,34ac1e,gameryamen,9,Thu Apr 30 00:43:55 2015 UTC,"Something to the effect of, ""One day I'll wash up on a beach with no fingerprints, but I don't wanna talk about work""?"
HIMYM,34ac1e,Syphon8,9,Thu Apr 30 04:10:08 2015 UTC,"I think it was closer to ""you can pay people to say anything"", but it's hard to separate the show back into episodes mentally, my brain just holds the story."
HIMYM,34ac1e,gameryamen,2,Thu Apr 30 04:47:46 2015 UTC,Haha was weed legal in any state two years ago? XD
HIMYM,34ac1e,xchx,10,Thu Apr 30 01:24:25 2015 UTC,Washington (the state) has had legal medical weed since the 90's :)

HIMYM,34ac1e,gameryamen,2,Thu Apr 30 04:49:42 2015 UTC,"Right. . . what's your ""medical condition""?"
HIMYM,34ac1e,ThisDerpForSale,4,Thu Apr 30 05:17:39 2015 UTC,"My qualifying condition is chronic back pain, which I honestly suffer from after a particularly destructive sneeze about 10 years ago. (Protip: don't sneeze with no air in your lungs!)  I additionally use cannabis medically for digestive support and stress relief, but unless I'm diagnosed with IBS, those conditions aren't a part of my medical authorization.  Plus, I occasionally use cannabis recreationally to get stoned :) Though that's a lot less common as I have quite the tolerance."
HIMYM,34ac1e,gameryamen,2,Thu Apr 30 05:47:13 2015 UTC,"Well, no need to worry about the details anymore.  It's all legal in the PacNW!*  *Ok, almost all legal down here in OR."

HIMYM,34ac1e,Pandibabi,12,Wed Apr 29 23:06:39 2015 UTC,"It's a thing that has happened before, but I think it is probably less common than people believe.   Actually, come to think of it, scapegoating is extremely common; what's rare is for the scapegoat to be actually in on the game. When that happens, and the golden parachute is revealed, it can trigger a legal process known as veil piercing, which empowers courts to overcome corporate liability shielding and hold executives personally liable for corporate actions."
HIMYM,34ac1e,NotRoryWilliams,5,Wed Apr 29 23:15:08 2015 UTC,"You're mixing up a lot of legal and economic concepts there.  Golden parachutes don't have anything to do with illegal activities or corporate fall guys.  It's the contractual exit package that corporate execs negotiate.  And piercing the corporate veil would be the method to find the real person behind the corporate alter-ego, not the fall guy.   Anyway, the more important point, I guess is that, as you say, corporations do sometimes use low level flunkies as fall guys."

I still don't get to say IANAL anymore though, cause it's never quite true, unless I insert subject matter or jurisdiction to the comment; and in this case, I am New York, but am not white collar crime, and my studies of the latter were merely incidental to a writing class."

HIMYM,34d67m,Adrianrg,4,Fri May 8 05:40:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Those premises could've worked if they'd stretched the events of the last two episodes out over most of the season, but instead they crammed it into forty-four minutes."
HIMYM,34d67m,gamedemon24,2,Thu Apr 30 10:37:18 2015 UTC,"I finished the show recently as well, I personally did not like the last season at all. The whole wedding spanning 22 episodes didn't do it for me. We should have gotten more of Ted and the mother IMO."
HIMYM,34d67m,darkknight915,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:22:24 2015 UTC,"And then trying to cram everything that happened after the wedding into just 2 episodes! broke my heart. Glad Mosby finally got back with robin, but if that was the whole point they could have showed more of the mother and maybe like a few more episodes of ted finding his way back to robin. not just his kids saying ""go get her dad"" and ending it"
HIMYM,34d67m,FlusteredNip,1 point,Mon May 4 01:27:54 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the club, they ruined 9 years of good TV and with 40 minutes of fan-fic bullshit. Actually the last 4 years all kinda sucked, but especially that last 40 minutes."
HIMYM,34d67m,ZDTRFGHL,1 point,Sun May 3 22:45:05 2015 UTC,If they wouldn't have spent so much time with Robin and Barney getting together and Ted letting go of Robin I think the ending could have worked
HIMYM,34d67m,whty383,2,Fri May 1 02:13:52 2015 UTC,They spent 7 years of the show shoving Ted letting go of Robin in your face until it made you sick. Then they pull that finale crap.
HIMYM,34d67m,ZDTRFGHL,-2,Sun May 3 22:47:58 2015 UTC,"Couldn't disagree more.  I thought the ending, as well as the entire show, was nearly perfect."
HIMYM,34d67m,rhcp88,-1,Thu Apr 30 05:05:19 2015 UTC,Sucks for you. I loved the ending.
HIMYM,34d67m,mbrw12,-2,Thu Apr 30 05:36:23 2015 UTC,"Even though I loved the ending, as well as the show. I think like this post by /u/Domyfranky stated, the finale was only a tribute to Robin & Ted, not the whole series. You should still be able to enjoy the earlier episodes even though of how bad you think the finale is.  Also there's also an alternative ending to the series, found on the DVD box set or on YouTube. It's a lot more happier ending, also it leaves Barney's and Robin's relationship open.  Also may I ask, what was so bad about the finale?"
HIMYM,34d67m,Seksuaali,3,Thu Apr 30 10:26:48 2015 UTC,"Give him some time, took me about 2 weeks to get over the finale and see why it's fine."

HIMYM,349zwr,jelatinman,4,Wed Apr 29 14:08:19 2015 UTC,"The Over-Correction is real. It's that thing you do when you avoid Arby's for 3 years after getting sick from it once, going for a job in a totally different job market after your boss was a dick one time, and when Barney dates Patrice, the complete opposite of Quinn. Look, she's even Filipino! Everyone borrowing Ted's stuff was funny. I loved how it just became a running thing throughout the series too, such as it being the subject of one of Marshall's bets back in season 7. The Playbook is burned! Something big is happening if that happens. If anything comes up, I will say so ;). Despite making me laugh I do wish we could have had one episode of Judy properly grieving her husband, because when we last saw her in season 6 (not dream sequence), she seemed to move on in about 2 weeks with the only freak out being that she's obsessed with planning the funeral.  ""We're family... With benefits!""   Great episode, was the start of a great run of season 8 episodes. The second half of this season destroys the first half by a long shot."
HIMYM,349zwr,mbrw12,4,Wed Apr 29 14:14:19 2015 UTC,Decent episode actually. Marshall's mom is a funny character when added in small doses throughout the seasons.

HIMYM,344ttv,Seksuaali,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:34:03 2015 UTC,"I doubt that Marshall and Lily told him about their sex life.   I think they did. They were frequently shown talking about it openly in front of the others. In other cases Ted could use his imagination ;D  And the story being focused on him makes sense - he's telling his kids about his young life, of which his four best friends were a very huge and important part."
HIMYM,344ttv,jtbatman,3,Thu Apr 30 16:55:56 2015 UTC,"maybe it would have been better if they showed all the gang together (into the McLaren's Pub,or maybe in a ""Robot vs Wrestler"" game) and Ted and Robin looking at each other,smiling,and you know that those two will end up together.   Yeah I would have liked that too, I think. But I'm guessing they just wanted to show that in 2030, Ted still is kind of a hopeless romantic.  But I agree it would have been more likeable for the most of us."

HIMYM,344ssz,Domyfranky,9,Tue Apr 28 08:29:14 2015 UTC,"People say that the womanizing in the finale was a serious step backwards, but he basically had a psychotic break and was seriously depressed. He hinted at it after his first breakup with Robin, nearly gave up entirely after Robin turned him down after he and Nora broke up, and went so hard with him and Quinn broke up that any breaks from it would cause immense depression.  Barney is a tragic character. I always feel like the womanizing was exaggerated by Future Ted. If he hadn't had such cartoonish schemes, would people had groaned at it or would they realize the patheticness of being 40 and acting like a 24 year old. Him having a baby really fixed him."
HIMYM,344ssz,jelatinman,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:15:45 2015 UTC,Well said.
HIMYM,344ssz,Ericws,5,Tue Apr 28 15:25:25 2015 UTC,"After bad divorces or similar ""tragedy-style"" events, people often revert to prior behavior as a means to cope.  It is totally understandable and believable that Barney's reaction to realizing that he and Robin were not meant to be was to become the same shameless womanizer he was before he fell fo Robin.  It was a shield he could raise against the pain of a failed relationship."
HIMYM,344ssz,Ericws,2,Tue Apr 28 15:27:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah,i wrote that too. But so why Lily or Marshall didn't say that,instead to show us a Barney who says ""this is me,can i please just be me?"" and then Marshall says ""okay"". Barney wasn't only that,he was suffering in those years,but the other characters,except maybe for Lily,acted like he wasn't."
HIMYM,344ssz,Ericws,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:30:03 2015 UTC,"What are they supposed to do?  They accept Barney as a friend unconditionally, have told him they want him to be happy, but he chooses a self-destructive womanizing path.  They love him as a friend regardless."
HIMYM,344ssz,Ericws,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:00:58 2015 UTC,"That ""this is me,can i please just be me?"" it's simply trivalization of Barney's character. Barney is more than that,and we saw this trough the seasons."
HIMYM,344ssz,Ericws,0,Tue Apr 28 17:36:38 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you.  Put yourself in the place of a friend of Barney- what would you do or say if he said that to you?  Exactly what Ted, Marshall and Lilly did.  Barney needed to bounce back on his own.  They told him what they thought, he rejected it, they stayed friends with him anyways.  Very realistic."
HIMYM,344ssz,Ericws,0,Wed Apr 29 13:38:22 2015 UTC,"If Carter Bays think that Barney ""is just that"" he doesn't know his character,i think we owe Barney's evolution only thanks to Craig Thomas and Neil Patrick Harris. If it was for Carter he should have let Barney womanizer all the time."

And when he had the baby, he snapped back and became himself again.  man, that is totally realistic and well-written.    i think everyone who says ""Barney regressed"" missed this well-written story line."

I mean it made more sense that he went back to the old him than him searching for love again.  But yeah, him going back to the old ways, that he knew that wouldn't make him truly happy in the end, made it look like he had given up on happiness. And it annoyed me a lot. But his ending helped it a bit.  My English isn't really good, I hope you get my point."
HIMYM,344ssz,rose_tattoo,1 point,Tue Apr 28 12:11:53 2015 UTC,Then why didn't they work out the first time they dated? I can't see anything that's different about them to think their marriage would succeed
HIMYM,344ssz,Seksuaali,2,Tue Apr 28 23:01:33 2015 UTC,"They both clearly loved each other but they were growing in ways that were very different of each other. The first time they dated they were becoming unlike themselves though.   As much as I hate to say it, the schmoopsy crap at the wedding had a point because they were at the height of their love. If the show went through the three years of marriage more there would have been more bro-moments between them and more developed heartbreak."
HIMYM,344ssz,Seksuaali,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:14:30 2015 UTC,"Well you can say the same for Robin and Ted,so if they didn't work the first time,why in 2030? I think that Ted and Robin in 2030 can work,but honestly also Barney and Robin could work."
HIMYM,344ssz,rose_tattoo,1 point,Wed Apr 29 07:38:40 2015 UTC,Ted and Robin broke up because the wanted different things. Barney and Robin broke up because they made each other miserable. They weren't happy.
HIMYM,344ssz,Seksuaali,1 point,Wed Apr 29 09:03:48 2015 UTC,"I think they broke up because she was always around the world and he felt alone without her in New York,and when he went with her she had to work so even in that case they could not spend time together. In 2030,Robin had her career and now she lives in New York again (like she says to Ted in the deleted scene) and Barney has his baby,he grow up so much. So,why don't try again? I think that Carter Bays was so focused on his 2006 vision of Ted and Robin together that he forgot that the same obstacles that put Ted and Robin far away were the same for Barney and Robin. For this reason he deleted the Barney/Robin love from the series,because he wanted the ending with Ted and Robin at any cost,no matter if he had to come back on season 2 to make it happening."

HIMYM,342ezp,Domyfranky,2,Tue Apr 28 08:10:49 2015 UTC,"I think they would have worked. Ted mostly came back to Robin only when he was single. I mean he really loved Stella and Victoria too, he proposed to them; but they just didn't marry him. If he had gotten married, I think he would have lived happily and eventually forgotten about Robin. Even more so with Tracy, because once he met her he would realise that she is the one he had always been looking for and didn't need Robin anymore.  I don't think Victoria was fully right, she was just jealous of Robin. For example Ted and Zoey didn't work for completely different reasons that had nothing to do with Robin."
HIMYM,342ezp,RusVir,2,Mon Apr 27 23:03:57 2015 UTC,"I guess she meant eventually they will all stop working because of Robin. With Zoey they didn't get to that point, because the relationship failed on its own before Robin was a factor."
HIMYM,342ezp,RusVir,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:44:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this would happen to all of them. At least in Stella's case, Ted said that if he had gotten married to her, he would still be with her in 2030, even though she also had her own issues with Tony.  And Ted definitely loved Tracy more than Robin, so I think there's no question there."
HIMYM,342ezp,Gefen,2,Tue Apr 28 16:16:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure Robin was there the entire time. We do know she and Barney were traveling a lot for her job. So maybe she wasn't really around that much and the Victoria Prophet was still correct.   It's a hard question, because we are getting informed quite stubbornly how Robin distance herself from the gang. (Myself, I claim she does that so Ted would have a shot with Tracy as she was aware of the issue.)"
HIMYM,342ezp,Seksuaali,2,Wed Apr 29 09:33:41 2015 UTC,"If Ted met Tracy before the wedding, when Ted was still trying to win Robin, even though she was already engaged to his best friend, Ted and Tracy would have not lasted.  If something else as big as his best friend and Robin getting married had happened, which basically forced Ted to get over Robin, then Ted ans Tracy would have lasted.  So I think, he had to completely let go of Robin, before even thinking about starting a family with someone else than her.  But the again, Ted almost married Stella, even though Robin came to the wedding and confessed her feelings for Ted."
HIMYM,342ezp,HarrisonEric,4,Mon Apr 27 20:13:36 2015 UTC,"True, but she basically said she wanted to have him as an option if she decided to do the whole married & kids thing. Not exactly a great offer."

The site is first introduced in the episode The Bracket of season 3, where Barney is going to apologize to Anna, but instead continues to pretend he is Ted, telling every woman there to stay away from Ted Mosby and lock up their sisters and mothers. The real site also contains a 20 minute song performed by Charlene Amoia (who plays Wendy the Waitress), as Anna. A link to the real site can be found here.  Let it be noted that the girl who made the website thought Barney was Ted. Barney proved that the whole architect thing worked and slept with her. Then he snuck out when she was in the shower and left a note explaining that he was a ghost, although the prepared note used the name Barney Stinson. It can also be noted that the section ""portraits of Ted"" shows drawings of a man resembling Barney Stinson getting injured and or killed in several ways, Ted the Porn star, and a letter from Barney and the girl started it was from TED. So Ted Mosby actually isn't a jerk, after all, as shown at Ted Mosby is not a jerk.com"

HIMYM,341flu,RusVir,-1,Tue Apr 28 01:27:32 2015 UTC,"Well she obviously at the start of the show was in love with Ted. And I think her feelings got back to her when Ted told he loves her on the roof. But on her trip to Russia she had time to think. And she knew she had to let Ted go, so both of them can follow their dreams.  Edit: loves* not love"
HIMYM,341flu,gizmo1492,0,Tue Apr 28 11:45:40 2015 UTC,"I think that Robin said ""no"" to Ted because she knew that Ted wanted a family and that she couldn't give it to him. She did the same thing with Kevin in the previous episode. Sadly,the writers rarely showed us Robin's point of view,so we'll never know what she thought during that week in Russia."
HIMYM,3414rp,jelatinman,7,Mon Apr 27 14:08:18 2015 UTC,"If I could change one aspect of the show, it wouldn't be the finale, Ted's ever longing pining for Robin, Stella being a bitch or anything else fans complain about. I'd make this a one hour episode that actually follows proper legal procedure. No jury can consist of 12 women, no court would allow Brad to sell his pitch by basically, no, literally saying nothing constructive, and this case would be taken very seriously. Look at that recent video of the Guatemalan company screwing with the Rainforest and how pissed off people got. This is a high profile case and deserved to be treated seriously as a one hour episode, since it's the biggest thing to happen to Marshall onscreen with his career.   But I still have to give bullet points.   Why is Lily always portrayed as a badass? It's not believable in her character anymore because of how soft she is. The badass should have been Robin, who rather than being the chain smoking gun toting scotch drinking lumberjack journalist, they focus on her Robin Sparkles phase when she's nice to Mounties and complies with them... Which in itself will eventually could have been used as foreshadowing to her turn in P.S. I Love You. Barney and Robin kissed! I missed that last episode. The ending with Barney giving up pursuit is cold but realistic, though it did seem like a red herring when it first came out.  Barney was in Magic Camp!    It's a meh episode that had a lot of wasted potential."
HIMYM,3414rp,Domyfranky,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:15:38 2015 UTC,"Well if you complain about the realism of the trial in this episode,you should watch the last 3 episodes of ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"",i ensure you that the trial in those episodes it's very worse in terms of ""realism"".

HIMYM,33wyp7,bhyman09,5,Mon Apr 27 01:54:15 2015 UTC,"Me too, but it was because Robin is a terrible g/f for Ted. She makes fun of him for everything he loves. Whether it is caligraphy, ren fests, or just being Ted. He kills himsef for her and gets nothing back from Robin besides sex.   I get why Ted loves her. Sometimes there are people in your life you can't shake. People who you will kill yourself for and you can't stop yourself. But that isn't real love, and hell Ted even knows this. It is obsession, it is unhealthy, and that is why the ending of this love story sucks. Because it isn't a love story. It is about a junky getting his fix."
HIMYM,33wyp7,RusVir,2,Mon Apr 27 02:02:48 2015 UTC,"The finale for me was more like ""wow. I'm so glad you spent 10 years telling this story to pretty much ask your children permission to bone Aunt Robin."" Fucking creepy."

And I don't feel the ending negates this scene.  Even the writers admitted this scene was ridiculous but they said it had to be done. It was to show that Ted genuinely moved on from Robin and never thought about her again until 2030.

Good filler that works to the strengths of HIMYM: a truth about modern American life shown through its quirky style, though for once this isn't about dating.

HIMYM,33t7n8,lauraj423,50,Sat Apr 25 12:06:23 2015 UTC,"I get why they got divorced, I mean Robin almost ran away from the wedding. It's just a shame, because of all the great moments they had."
HIMYM,33t7n8,MissRepresentation,32,Sat Apr 25 12:08:47 2015 UTC,Don't forget Barney's shitty behavior before the wedding as well (getting blackout drunk and getting lost the night before the wedding).
HIMYM,33t7n8,MissRepresentation,36,Sat Apr 25 14:24:16 2015 UTC,I think it was more about Barney freaking out. Unlike Robin who was actually going to leave the wedding if Tracy wasn't there to stop her.
HIMYM,33t7n8,Air0ck,16,Sat Apr 25 14:26:49 2015 UTC,"I'm agreeing with you here. Both of their behavior is why they weren't meant to be. TBH I'm surprised more people thought they should end up together when the entirety of the 9th season basically existed to show how Barney and Robin weren't right for each other and that Ted cares more about Robin than Barney ever did. I watched the season with my ex boyfriend (after the show was over, so he knew what happened in the finale but I did not), and I just kept saying ""Shit, Ted and Robin really should have ended up with each other"" to him during the 9th season. When I saw the finale, it all started making sense to me. Like, okay, this is why the writers made the ninth season the way they did... Because Ted and Robin really did end up together in the end."
HIMYM,33t7n8,wooloow,16,Sat Apr 25 14:40:00 2015 UTC,Yeah. For some reason the season 9 made everyone think Barney and Robin were meant to be together. And how the whole season was useless just because it was about a wedding weekend of a failed marriage.  The wedding weekend lasted almost a whole season just because of its importance on Ted's life.
HIMYM,33t7n8,MissRepresentation,13,Sat Apr 25 14:46:30 2015 UTC,"As Barney would say; it wasn't a failed marriage, but a successful one that ended after three years.   Why drag it out and end up hating eachother?"
HIMYM,33t7n8,Domyfranky,5,Sat Apr 25 17:07:24 2015 UTC,"Totally agree on that.  When finally Ted rings Robin's door bell, it is like everyone is making the same old mistake, over and over again.  OK, the kids try to justify that, and say ""it is 6 years since Tracy died"", but what is the purpose of finding ""the one"", and feeling true love eventually, just to go back with Robin?  Robin made it clear once: «Ted, the future is scary. But you can’t just run back to the past because it’s familiar. Yes, it’s tempting, but it's a mistake»."
HIMYM,33t7n8,Domyfranky,4,Sun Apr 26 04:34:28 2015 UTC,"I was confused when I read that everyone thought the 9th season showed that Barney and Robin were meant to be together, when I thought it was the opposite. I also think the season had to be really long because the show really is called ""How I Met Your Mother,"" and the premise is Ted telling the kids how he met their mother, so the show couldn't really explain a whole lot that happened after meeting the mother because the kids already know all that. So the season had to be really dragged out to show as much of the mother as possible via flashbacks before Ted officially meets the mother in the chronological sequence. I do think the last season and finale could have been done a bit better though."

And their original plan was to end it with only seeing The Mother as little as in season 8. But I think showing more of The Mother was better."
HIMYM,33t7n8,Domyfranky,5,Sat Apr 25 15:04:20 2015 UTC,Well i don't think it's true at all. The writers did a bad job if their intention was to make people to root for Ted and Robin.

HIMYM,33t7n8,Slevo,7,Sat Apr 25 15:37:20 2015 UTC,"Well i think it was a mistake to develop the B/R relationship so much,if they wanted Ted and Robin together. T/R should have stayed the center of the show,like it was on the first two seasons. Since season 3,the show took a different direction. They introduce the Yellow Umbrella (the first sign of the ""humanization"" of the Mother) and they developed the Barney/Robin's relationship (That,at the end of the day,was totally pointless. Barney could have continued to sleep around and he would have had a daughter one day)."
HIMYM,33t7n8,outtokill7,2,Sat Apr 25 16:31:17 2015 UTC,T/R should have stayed the center of the show   A tremendous amount of Season 9 screen-time was dedicated to the Ted and Robin relationship.

HIMYM,33t7n8,Domyfranky,2,Sat Apr 25 22:13:42 2015 UTC,"Well I guess I have to agree with this. Carter & Craig actually told us that Barney & Robin was meant to just to be a small thing, no more than them sleeping together a few times, or something like that.

Robin and Barney were flawed as a couple but they had a lot in common and Barney supported her when she couldn't have kids. Robin and Ted fought over things like her messiness.

HIMYM,33t7n8,ij3k,18,Sat Apr 25 12:28:30 2015 UTC,"I agree, but they really loved each other. I was just hoping they would have lasted, because I liked them together. And they must have really wanted for it to work. I mean they lasted 3 years, that's a long time."
HIMYM,33t7n8,kurutemanko,7,Sat Apr 25 12:30:02 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I never really liked this as the big ending for Barney Stinson. We know what he really is and getting tied down in a marriage, without the chance to be the father he never had, isn't what I thought was best for the character."
HIMYM,33t7n8,rose_tattoo,9,Sat Apr 25 12:34:05 2015 UTC,"Very much agreed. I think Barney and Ted fake-adopting a kid back in an earlier season kind of gave us a hint into the fact that Barney didn't mind the idea of raising a kid, but didn't want to be tied down by a marriage. And as far as Robin and him are concerned, yes they had chemistry and lots of love for each other, but as we have learned from the show many times, love alone isnt enough to make it last forever."
HIMYM,33t7n8,kurutemanko,3,Sat Apr 25 12:38:33 2015 UTC,"And as far as Robin and him are concerned, yes they had chemistry and lots of love for each other, but as we have learned from the show many times, love alone isnt enough to make it last forever.   Bingo"
HIMYM,33t7n8,rose_tattoo,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:38:33 2015 UTC,But they needed to explain it more. It's just not good to resolve the thing only in the first 5 minutes of the finale. It should have filled more screentime. We went from their wedding day directly to the fight of the divorce. There should have been a period of interval.

HIMYM,33t7n8,Festeroo4Life,23,Sat Apr 25 22:18:41 2015 UTC,I wish Barney and Nora lasted. I'm still bitter about the ending so Robin can go fuck herself.
HIMYM,33t7n8,RusVir,4,Sat Apr 25 23:07:47 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest reason why Nora & Barney didn't last was because Barney felt like Nora was too good for a guy like Barney. But sure they would have been great together.  About Robin still after all they have gone trough, not a big surprise still loved Ted. I wouldn't blame her for anything."
HIMYM,33t7n8,Justice_Prince,2,Sat Apr 25 13:28:05 2015 UTC,"Argh no! The reason Nora and Barney didn't last is because Barney was going to leave her for Robin, and Robin didn't have the courage to tell Kevin she slept with Barney. So Robin basically ruined the lives of everyone. I agree with OP's sentiments on the matter."
HIMYM,33t7n8,AnghellicKarma,9,Sat Apr 25 13:32:05 2015 UTC,"We all could have stomached it if it hadn't happened 15 minutes into the episode after they got married.  Season 9 execution was so poor. Wedding could have been midseason, and we could have gotten time to see it fall apart. Having everything happen in the finale made a bad episode exponentially worse."

It wasnt, they were in love, they both wanted to get married, and they were a good match for a short time. Their marriage lasted for years, and it seemed to be a whirlwind of fun. Their marriage ended in a way that relationships end, and pretty well.   I also think that her relationship with barney opened her up to later be with ted. So I think it is pretty full of points, and I dont think that the writers did wrong in focusing all of the last season on it."

HIMYM,33p3df,jtbatman,4,Sat Apr 25 00:46:13 2015 UTC,"They didn't have enough time to fit in anymore scenes in the finale. And they didn't want to do season 10 either. Another reason is that as Carter & Craig said, they didn't want the finale to be focused on the sad events of life. So that's why they didn't spent time on Ted mourning over Tracy.  And in my opinion there were enough scenes to show that Ted was in love with Tracy, not Robin (while he was with Tracy)."
HIMYM,33p3df,Seksuaali,8,Fri Apr 24 12:04:32 2015 UTC,Yes.  That is why I think C&C made some poor decisions as far as usage of time in the season as a whole and in the finale.  They could have eased up on the shock value a little.
HIMYM,33p3df,Ericws,-1,Fri Apr 24 13:18:26 2015 UTC,"I think the wedding weekend was really important to be as long as it was. I think it was the most meaningful weekend of Ted's life. Also the episodes they got there were pretty important in my opinion.  But sure, they could've deleted at least 2 episodes worth of scenes to use in the finale. For an example I think the Marshall's road trip took way too much time and it wasn't really important anyways."

HIMYM,33p3df,Ericws,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:24:30 2015 UTC,"That's really beautifully said, I agree with you.

It may have only been about 5-10 more minutes, or a couple of additional scenes.   I agree. What do you think they should have added? More scenes of Ted, to explain to us what he was thinking?"

That is not what happened, but it felt like it."
HIMYM,33p3df,Ericws,3,Mon Apr 27 16:11:23 2015 UTC,"I agree I think that is one of the most important weekends of his life which is why there is a whole season dedicated to it. But I also think that everything that happened in the finale had to be in one episode. Because if some of the main events happened over a few episodes, like the divorce or Tracy dying, then there would be so many people turned off for the finale.   Edit: Also to your top comment. Yeah there was enough scenes to get some insight on to how great Ted and Tracy's marriage was. But I think a lot of people forget that they had an awesome life together that we don't get to see. Yeah she dies within minutes of meeting her and we really hoped to see their relationship but that wasn't what the story was about. I think we were shown enough to know how great it was but if we really want comfort we have to just imagine what their marriage would have been like in between the few minutes we saw when they met and when Tracy was sick."

Yes, Barney and Robin are getting married and Ted is about to meet the love of his life, but it was also the last hurrah for the gang,  That's why the argument that the whole season was a waste because it was all about Barney and Robin's wedding and they quickly divorced in the finale is silly to me."
HIMYM,33p3df,itdothstink,2,Sat Apr 25 08:09:39 2015 UTC,The finale was perfect and made complete sense based on everything we know about the characters. Love it.
HIMYM,33p3df,mbrw12,2,Fri Apr 24 19:31:58 2015 UTC,"Yes.  That is the error of the finale.  In the ""myth"" of the story plot itself, everything is there- in Time Travelers, Vesuvius, and a small handful of other shows, he expressed that longing and mourning of a widower to his lost wife.  So they did pull this off.  And 6 years had passed since she'd died, as well.  BUT, when it comes to the final scene, the fact that they did not reveal Tracy's fate beforehand, leading to this undue suspense, and that most if not the vast majority looked forward to enjoying her character a little more, what happened was unnecessarily jarring and had possibly more shock value than expected even by the writers."
HIMYM,33p3df,Ericws,2,Fri Apr 24 13:17:15 2015 UTC,"The deleted scenes really helped the episode out, they should have gotten it super sized like The Office did. There's a diner scene that really shows that Ted and Robin are in different places in their lives. Ted has truly moved on, and only allowed himself to try for Robin again after being alone for 6 years since his wife died."
HIMYM,33p3df,jelatinman,2,Fri Apr 24 14:22:00 2015 UTC,"I thought the ending was fine.  Not quite what I had imagined, but fine.   The only thing that I would nit-pick was the almost maudlin acting on part of it, but who can blame them.  A good comparison is the finale of That 70's Show.  The finale was relatively funny, but they had to get all of the last catchphrases and lines in before it was over.    All in all.  I was very happy with the end.  After all, if the mom was alive, why would he have gotten away telling the story of how they met without being interrupted or corrected?   #somewhatsexistbut????"
HIMYM,33p3df,MyronFloren,0,Fri Apr 24 19:52:13 2015 UTC,"And then trying to cram everything that happened after the wedding into just 2 episodes! broke my heart. Glad Mosby finally got back with robin, but if that was the whole point they could have showed more of the mother and maybe like a few more episodes of ted finding his way back to robin. not just his kids saying ""go get her dad"" and ending it"
HIMYM,33p3df,FlusteredNip,-1,Mon May 4 01:29:01 2015 UTC,"the two big developments of the story (the Barney/Robin relationship and the apperance of the Mother) were killed in a few minutes only to come back to 2006,when Robin was in love with Ted,Barney was only a womanizer and the mistery of the Mother was not important like it was on the latest seasons."
HIMYM,33p3df,Domyfranky,0,Fri Apr 24 17:09:54 2015 UTC,"Robin loving Ted again didn't destroy her character development. At 2006 she chose her work over Ted.  And Barney, yes it was kind of weird how he started sleeping with random women again. But it was just him realizing that relationships just were not for him. And I think they showed that well on the whole season 9. In the end he did end up happy, after his child was born.   the mistery of the Mother was not important like it was on the latest seasons.   Why is this a bad thing? I liked that they showed more of the mother, unlike they planned."
HIMYM,33p3df,Seksuaali,0,Fri Apr 24 17:20:53 2015 UTC,"All of that it just needed more explanation. It's ok for Robin to fall in love again with Ted,but you need to explain it more,after all the years where she was in love with Barney. In the way they did it,it seemed that Robin wanted Ted only because she saw him with Tracy. For Barney,it's ok for him to come back to womanizing,but they needed to explain better his pain after the divorce with Robin. They needed to tell us clearly that Barney was broken after the divorce,because he tried to change for her,but it didn't work anyway. I think Barney really suffered after the divorce with Robin,but in the way they showed  the situation it seemed that his relationship with Robin was pointless and that he didn't care at all. In their 2006 script,i think Barney never had a relationship and he simply knocked up a girl and had a baby. So at the time they didn't need to show him suffering.  But in 2014 they needed to change their script and focus more on his pain after the divorce with Robin,to show us that their relationship mattered to him. But they didn't. About the Mother mistery,i meant: In 2006,it's ok to kill the Mother offscreen,because at that time the majority of the people rooted for Ted and Robin,and the wiewers didn't care so much about the Mother. But in 2014,all the people loved her and the majority of the fans hated Ted and Robin together,so they neeeded to change their script and give more focus on the Mother death,show us Ted's grief and explain us why Ted and Robin this time will work. Instead,they just didn't care,they said ""Ted and Robin together because this is what we all wanted in 2006!"" and they didn't care to explain us the things in a better way."
HIMYM,33p3df,Domyfranky,0,Fri Apr 24 18:28:52 2015 UTC,"They showed us only one reason why Barney and Robin divorced. But they were together for 3 years, they must have had more problems with their marriage. So even though they may have still loved each other, I don't think they really were unhappy.  Robin didn't start having feelings for Ted right after her divorce with Barney. And yeah sure, seeing Ted together with Tracy made her regret that she didn't go for him. But I think she would have regretted even if Ted was single, but who knows.  And for Barney, sure he put everything he got in to the relationship with Robin. But he finally got to know that it's not for him, as not even Robin could make him happy.  C&C original plan was to only show The Mother as much as in season 8 final episode and then tell about her death and Ted get together with Robin. I guess that could have been a better ending, for most of the people. But I don't think there's nothing wrong with showing 1 season of The Mother."
HIMYM,33p3df,Seksuaali,-1,Fri Apr 24 20:39:47 2015 UTC,"And why don't give more focus on her death? Why kill her off-screen? This is just bad storytelling,we didn't even knew for sure that the Mother was officialy dead,that the kids were already talking about Aunt Robin..come on! Why so rushed? They really didn't have sensibility on the theme. -About Robin,you said right: ""Who knows?"" This is the major problem salute major problem. They didn't show us anything,the first rule of a writer is ""show,don't tell"" and they broke it. We can only assume things,but we don't know nothing for sure,and this is just bad storytelling."
HIMYM,33p3df,Domyfranky,0,Sat Apr 25 08:11:51 2015 UTC,"They have been asked a question about why not focusing or Tracy's death. Their answer was they didn't want the finale to be focused on the negative things of life. Why is it so important to show the obvious, Ted mourning over Tracy and the gang comforting him?  Maybe Robin wouldn't have had feelings for Ted in that halloween ~2016. But I think in the end they would have ended up together in 2030 anyways."
HIMYM,33p3df,Seksuaali,0,Sat Apr 25 08:48:52 2015 UTC,"So,Carter and Craig wanted to kill Ted's love life,but at the same time they didn't want to ""focus on the bad things""? This is a little incoherent from them,let me say it. It's not ""show the obvious"" it's good storytelling,showing us Ted's grief,to suffer with him and understand better his pain and the reasons of his choices."
HIMYM,33p3df,Domyfranky,0,Sat Apr 25 09:05:26 2015 UTC,The kids know she is dead. Ted doesn't need to rehash that

Robin married Barney because he was the only one she knew who wasn't interested in having kids.  When Robins career takes off Barney is bored with nothing to do, and Robin is not going to give up her career that she has worked hard for.

I think it's because of how badly executed it was rather than any actual content that made me upset (though it is kind of racist). But this is also the one where Barney has a dog for a wingman, so there was at least some actual comedy in there. Chatting up the fatties and helping Brover get some action is just hilarious.  Poor Barney, Quinn really did a number on him. Even though it was a dark suicide joke, nothing outside of the finale made him as depressed as losing the dog.  Ted and Victoria break up for basically the reason Victoria said she wouldn't date him a year ago. My problems with these breakups is that they're so abrupt it's just bad. Victoria could have created a great bookend to the show, where she isn't the One and actually acts like herself. Being a single woman at 32 is tough and leads to desperation but it could have been handled better. Hopefully The Jim Gaffigan Show treats Ashley Williams well. Oh wait, this is the one where Nick drives the moped. He's also revealed to have a cooking show and is terrible at catchphrases. I'll cave, it made me laugh.

Robin's too emotional, Barney's not kind enough to children, Ted is being all sadsack, Marshall has no energy because Jason Segel doesn't give a crap, Lily is even more emotional. Oddly I have seen clips from this episode become popular on this subreddit, such as how Barney would help Marvin get over a breakup. The ending was nice because it ended the ""8 or higher"" rule that seriously constrained Marshall and Lily for a while. Where did the wheel come from? Who knows! Obviously a re-hash of the classic Friends episode ""The One with the Embryos"" in which an impromptu game show was made between Joey/Chandler and Rachel/Monica over their apartments.

For example, I find it completely ruins any of Barney's development because I know he'll just regress about 8 years in the last 20 minutes of the entire series.  As a matter of fact, you can pretty much erase 6 seasons of events and many aspects of the ending would have made more sense to me."

So that ending with Barney is even worse. Barney has done this string of repeatedly hitting on girls after break-ups before; after Shannon dumped him he started it, after Robin broke up with him he did it (and became so good at it it tore her apart and became a plot point), and he did it with Quinn with ""Bang-toberfest."" He's only not done this after a break up with Nora, because he got too devastated over Robin in ""Tick, Tick, Tick."" The nanny from St. Cloud being dissuaded because they're friends with Barney was about the only funny part of this episode. I'm one of the few people who believes babies don't ruin sitcoms, but this episode could make a pretty good case for it. Ted and Robin competing over Victoria/Nick... ugh where do I begin with this? Completely derails Victoria because of the stupid ""getting back with your ex is just pausing the relationship"" rule. It worked with every relationship in the show but this one, because it made Victoria not cool and fun but kinda shrill and filled with unmentioned flaws.  With Nick, being emotional isn't bad Robin! But they made Nick too emotional, just to show that Robin is right. Normally I'm okay with sensitive guys, being one myself, but Nick is a drag. Also the moped thing vs the motorcycle thing? Yeah, okay, whatever."

However, there's also Barney flirting with a German woman to help a bro and Quinn blatantly hitting on a guy without caring about Barney's feelings. I probably won't ever understand this couple. First appearance of Nick... I don't understand the point of his character. He was treated as a super-serious boyfriend and great guy in the group, but then is also used as competition fodder to say ""this guy is hotter than Barney and Robin!"" but is also really dumb and shallow. Robin herself could be just as dumb as Nick when they were dating, and this is the only one where they are of equal intelligence. Which tie is better? It was clear from the beginning this would be about insecurity, and this was later used with the big suit in season 9."
HIMYM,338rrp,mbrw12,3,Mon Apr 20 16:11:23 2015 UTC,Nick is one of the most forgettable 1 dimensional character in the whole show. He just kinda shows up out of nowhere and I guess we're supposed to be interested in him. The other guys Robin dates at least make sense
HIMYM,338rrp,RusVir,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:42:30 2015 UTC,Like her therapist?!
HIMYM,338rrp,rose_tattoo,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:18:21 2015 UTC,This is not the first appearance of Nick. He was introduced in s6e21 Hopeless.
HIMYM,338rrp,mbrw12,2,Wed Apr 22 15:02:32 2015 UTC,THAT was Nick? Wow! Good catch!
HIMYM,338rrp,TotesMessenger,2,Wed Apr 22 15:34:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah he was Robins crush guy. We never saw how they met again which was annoying. He just appeared, which is probably why you didn't catch it."
HIMYM,334w0h,jelatinman,9,Sun Apr 19 16:02:10 2015 UTC,"How could an episode go so right and so wrong at the same time?   Believe it or not this is the first hour-long episode in the entire series. Some things that seem like they should be aired in an hour (ex. The Wedding/Drumroll, Please) actually aired in two separate weeks! Didn't hurt that both parts of this episode were funny and progressed the plot, so kudos. Marshall being drunk off his ass is one of the funniest things in the whole show. I wouldn't be surprised if the sequence with the stairs inspired Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street and its infamous Quaalude scene. Robin is not only uncomfortable with babies, but also human birth. A nice crack to her tough exterior despite her helping give birth to cows. ""I'm having a heart attack."" Great Spartacus reference, in a time when most have become tired and uninspired. Oh great, Doctor Sonia. This is her final appearance in the show, so she's put at her most angry. No motorcycles on the casino floor! A nice callback to the Boogie Boarding incident at McClaren's.  Marvin (aww) Eriksen. No scratch that, Marvin Wait-For-It Eriksen. Since this is never commented upon for the rest of the series, I assume Marvin just goes by Marvin W. on his checks. Robin's right, Victoria was the only girl besides Robin at the time that was even close to being Ted's one true love. They had really good chemistry and she was quite mature throughout the relationship and so swee- Victoria what the fuck?! I only have accepted this because of the possibility that Ted is Victoria's Robin, a guy she should have given up on but can't let go of the feelings for. I hope she's happy in the future since she's not the mother (obviously). Never liked that ""8 or higher"" system Marshall and Lily instilled, which hurt a lot of the early season 8 episodes. New parents really are that messed up though. Soulless, even. Barney proposes to Quinn!... But doom can only be spelt for the lovebirds. The vacation was far too early, but Quinn quit stripping just so Barney would be happy. Giving up your career, no matter how awful it seems, is not something you do for people! But even then, they finally complete the flash-forward of Barney's wedding to show the bride to be Robin. Ted, what the fuck?! So you really do take Victoria to ride off into the sunset? It doesn't matter what happens in the season 8 premiere that justifies it and shows his conflict, this episode ends with them riding into the sunset. This was the last shot people were left with for 4 months in 2011! Remember how awful it was when you got left at the altar, and how you didn't move on from that until The Wedding Bride forced you to confront it? God... Really details Victoria's character too."

HIMYM,331580,jelatinman,4,Sat Apr 18 14:32:01 2015 UTC,"Do I think they spent too much time on Ted getting over Robin? Heck yes. Is this really the amount of time it can take to get over somebody? Heck yes. In fact, it takes roughly the same time for Ted to get over Robin as it does for Marshall to get over Lily in season 2, but it was accelerated in season 2 for 2-3 episodes over 4 months while it takes like 5 episodes over a few months here. Barney, what the fuck bro? I'd be jealous if my girlfriend were showing her body off to other men, but you also have to remember that she likes doing her job and doesn't want to be pressured into quitting stripping just because you don't like it. It's like being married to an actor; they're gonna play things up for the audience. Ah yes, I fucking love this plot with Marshall and Lily. It's short and dumb but sets up one of the best comedic set-pieces the show has ever done: Barney and Marshall getting drunk off their asses in Atlantic City while Lily goes into early labor."

In the same humor type than Parks & Rec, you have Community (which is excellent, especially seasons 2-4), Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Friends is similar to HIMYM. Chuck and Big Bang Theory are very good too. Those are my all-time favorites. So many laughs and hours invested (not lost!) in watching these shows!!!"
HIMYM,330ij8,Domyfranky,7,Sat Apr 18 08:47:00 2015 UTC,"I don't hate the ending at all, but I agree with this. The fact is, they needed 1 more episode to draw it out. There needed to be mourning time for the mother, and there needed to be a gradual break-up for these two."
HIMYM,330ij8,AlvisDBridges,6,Sat Apr 18 09:03:36 2015 UTC,"This would have helped for sure,but i think a lot of people would have been pissed off anyway,because they spend 3 seasons building the relationship between Barney and Robin,and a lot of people believed in their relationship and though that they were meant to be (not me,but i know a lot of people loved them together) but surely giving at least 1 more episode to draw it out would have helped so much."
HIMYM,330ij8,gizmo1492,3,Sat Apr 18 09:27:07 2015 UTC,"because they spend 3 seasons building the relationship between Barney and Robin,and a lot of people believed in their relationship and though that they were meant to be   I'd argue even more than 3 seasons, given Barney finally admitted his feelings for her starting in season 4, and the two slept together and had small moments then as well.   In fact, I'd say the show spent as much if not more time on building up Barney's crush turned love for Robin and their will-they/won't they dance together than they did Ted/Robin."
HIMYM,330ij8,rose_tattoo,1 point,Sat Apr 18 09:42:28 2015 UTC,I think Season 9 clearly showed that Barney and Robin were not going to make it as a couple
HIMYM,330ij8,rose_tattoo,2,Sat Apr 18 10:58:56 2015 UTC,"I would not use the word ""clearly"". Yes,they had issues,but the writers also showed us that they cared about each other a lot. Anyway,the problem isn't in the divorce itself,the problem is in the fact that they deleted their relationship from the story,like it never existed,only in the purpose to come back in the ""2006 scenario"" of the story."
HIMYM,330ij8,RusVir,0,Sat Apr 18 12:05:30 2015 UTC,They didn't delete their relationship they are still in each others lives. Just not as a married couple. They ALL cared about each other a lot
HIMYM,330ij8,gamedemon24,2,Sat Apr 18 13:18:18 2015 UTC,"Barney and Robin were close friend even in season 6 when they weren't together. In the finale,Robin it's all around the world and the few times she is with one of the group she refers only to her love for Ted and doesn't mention at all her pain for the divorce with Barney. For Barney is the same,he went from ""I'm hopelessly in love with her"" from ""i was always a playboy and i won't change"" and he never mention his relationship with Robin again. This is because Bays and Thomas came back to 2006 in the last episode. They came back to their 2006 script,when Barney and Robin weren't even a thing."
HIMYM,330ij8,rose_tattoo,1 point,Sat Apr 18 13:56:40 2015 UTC,"Barney does mention his relationship with Robin, go watch the finale again. He feels guilty about scoring a girl's number in front of her and tries to hide it. He said ""If it wasn't going to work with Robin, it's just not going to work with anyone."" And when he meets her at Ted's wedding - ""Whoa Robin I don't think of you that way anymore.""  Besides they got divorced by mutual consent, both agreed that it didn't work out. There wasn't much else for them to say after that."
HIMYM,330ij8,gamedemon24,2,Sun Apr 19 15:43:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah i know,i watched the ending more times than any other episode. You know,that quote ""Robin i don't think of you that way anymore"" it's a clear sign of their willing to delete the Barney/Robin relationship from the story. It's a clear sign that they wanted us to think that their relationship was not important,it was only a footnote of history.But trough the seasons they showed us a Barney who was ""hopelessly,irretrievably in love with her"" and every time he tried to move on (with Nora,with Quinn) he always came back to Robin. And now,they want us to think that Barney after the divorce completely deletes his love for Robin,and they even try to tell us that he isn't even sexual attracted to her?? This is too much,we could accept this in 2006,but not in 2014 after at least six seasons where they showed us a Barney 90% of the time in love with Robin. I think Bays (not Thomas,i know he loved the development of the story in the latest seasons) really wanted to delete the Barney/Robin relationship from the story,he never liked them together,and in the ending he finally did it. I wonder why Thomas let him do it."

HIMYM,330ij8,RusVir,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:20:17 2015 UTC,"I blame NPH  As this show has progressed, have you guys been rooting for Barney and Robin to make it as a couple?  *Neil Patrick Harris: *I have. I’ve been actively trying to make that happen. I talk to the writers and I was pitching it, and I’d try to do little things in our scenes together where I gave her an extra look and an extra glance or would stare only at her during a whole scene just to see if anyone was noticing. I thought there was a nice wrinkle about Barney liking the chick that Ted wants. Though really I was just hoping that I’d get to ‘F’ her once and get it out of my system, but it was a good ‘F’. It was a capital ‘F’!"

HIMYM,330ij8,RusVir,0,Sun Apr 19 19:21:31 2015 UTC,"Well the writers were in charge,so you can't blame NPH,he was the star of the show,let's face it,so i think Bays and Thomas developed the Barney/Robin relationship because it took highest ratings to the show. The point is: you can't develop a relationship like that and then delete it from the story in the last episode,almost like it never existed."
HIMYM,330ij8,itdothstink,1 point,Sat Apr 18 12:03:13 2015 UTC,"Yes Bays and Thomas should have told NPH how it was going to end and to stop wasting his time, but they didn't so what they did is to write them as a crappy couple    i think Bays and Thomas developed the Barney/Robin relationship because it took highest ratings to the show.    No it wasn't,season 5 was the worst season of the series and it continued to decline. Barney fans hated ""boyfriend"" Barney which is why they split them up pretty quickly"
HIMYM,330ij8,rose_tattoo,2,Sat Apr 18 13:14:45 2015 UTC,"Not true about the ratings. Season 7 and season 9 were the most viewed. ""The Final Page"" was one of the most viewed episodes,same for ""Symphony of Illumination"" (The one after the cliffchanger ending ""i'm pregnant"" that Robin said to Barney in 7x11). And you can go on Twitter and Tumbrl and see how the majority of the fandom rooted for the couples Barney-Robin and Ted-Tracy,it's not a mistery that those were the two most beloved couples. Anyway yes,Bays and Thomas should have told to NPH and the rest of the cast (and the rest of the writers staff) the ending so they could act and write Barney and Robin like a couple ""not meant to be"". Instead,Bays and Thomas prefered to don't say nothing to anyone,so the other writers wrote Barney and Robin like a romantic couple who belongs each other(and they wrote the Ted/Robin relationship like a wrong couple,look at episodes like ""Hopeless""),and NPH and Cobie Smulders acted in the same way. So unprofessional from Bays and Thomas to do that."

Love in the Time of Cholera has been an inspiration for the story and has been referenced since season 1 by Ted as his favorite book. I think someone on reddit once made the comparison of HIMYM to a modern retelling of the book.
HIMYM,32unrl,gizmo1492,2,Fri Apr 17 01:43:42 2015 UTC,"In Milk, Ted gives us his perfect woman list which includes Love in the Time of Cholera.

HIMYM,32u34x,Seksuaali,0,Fri Apr 17 05:28:27 2015 UTC,Probably because a) she still loved Barney and b) Barney went ALL OUT for her.

She was the one that got him to go all out. A challenge for Robin was far more exciting and it probably increased her attraction to Barney.    It's fun to go after a person everyone wants and no one gets, rather than go with the one that is literally searching for someone to love and marry.   Maybe that's why?"

Sad Ted is sad :( Oddly enough has no sideplot, a rarity for modern sitcoms. The women are mostly in the fantasies of the men, and Barney's affection for Quinn is to show how much he's changed. Back-boobs have surprisingly good prosthetics, but it's still creepy to look at. First reveal of when Ted's daughter is born (2015), which gives one of the first blatantly overt signs that the show is in its final act."

Ted mentions exceptions a lot, like 3 day rules, bro codes, etc . Barney even does too some.  In his play ""The Robin"" he has some part (don't remember details) where he makes sure Ted is okay with it and he has Teds blessing.  I think this kinda is similar to the end, meaning that the blessing thing was needed.  I wouldn't think Barney would truthfully be okay with it until I saw him when he saw his daughter.  I think his daughter filled the void that Robin left, meaning he could give Ted his blessing.  Obviously we don't see this happen, but I like to think it did."

HIMYM,32k2r0,Gefen,8,Tue Apr 14 12:49:05 2015 UTC,"Tracy was not a compromise. If Ted was given the choice between Tracy and Robin, he would definitely choose Tracy, because she was the true ""one"" and he really loved her the most. Getting Robin back was his consolation prize for losing Tracy."
HIMYM,32k2r0,RusVir,3,Tue Apr 14 17:10:22 2015 UTC,"As I watch the ""last"" monologue of Ted, I feel he had some kind of realization that their time together is limited. ""I have to love her"" wasn't about forcing himself to love her. It was not wasting any of their time together on any other thing. Still, I guess there is a limit how much we can argue around that with so much Robin experience and so little of Tracy..  I feel it makes me feel a bit better about it. Still, rough ending for a sitcom..."
HIMYM,32k2r0,Seksuaali,6,Tue Apr 14 20:25:40 2015 UTC,"I feel like Ted really did stop loving Robin... at one point. Does this make Robin ""wrong"" for Ted? I don't think so.  And also I think you shouldn't even compare Robin and Tracy, Ted loved both and was happy (I think) with both of them and that should be all that matters.  Ted found two loves of his life."
HIMYM,32k2r0,Seksuaali,2,Tue Apr 14 18:29:53 2015 UTC,"I can relate to that, and as I said, I think she also cared for him as a dear friend and knew he will struggle to go on (date Tracy) with her around. Which is one of the thing bothered me about it.   I think that more about the choosing between the two of them, I struggle with the idea that he did find his ""happy ending"" just to have it taken from him.   I think I would have felt the same if it was Victoria dying after the first season if she would have gotten such a montage of how prefect they were for each other before pulling that rag away. Victoria was a great character, but they did a great job with the actual mother (or was it just the greatness of Christin?)   I guess that finishing the series with the Blue French Horn instead of the Yellow Umbrella was quite a statement from C&C. Probably having the kids actually saying casually how stupid we are (the crowd) not realizing this is a story about Robin, didn't make it any easier. We are getting ""This is a story about getting back to Robin"" while the crowd was still on ""What a lovely couple Ted and Tracy was""  Well, I will not forget this ending for a while, and I don't think I will have the courage to follow any of C&C work (and if I did, very very carefully, and I mean GOT carefully)"
HIMYM,32k2r0,Seksuaali,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:46:52 2015 UTC,"Well said, I fully agree with you.  I loved the idea of the ending, but I would've liked to see more build up to Ted getting together with Robin for it to make more sense.   And also a scene where we get to see that Ted isn't thinking about Robin and him together, while married to Tracy to show that he's happy with her (like in the deleted lunch scene).  Liked the idea of the ending, but it was a bit too rushed I think."
HIMYM,32k2r0,klapaucius,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:59:26 2015 UTC,"It is true, we all would have enjoy more of the gang in its final form. I think this is also what was so charming about the mother. While we saw all the other characters in their best and worst moments, Tracy was only shown at her best (even when she denied the purpose). so she got this angelic aura over her which maybe is what made her so charming.   I think that I'm starting to accept the ending for what it was. But it was a bit rushed (though, I'm not sure how they could have shoved it all to one episode without getting a 1 hour special or something)  It seems like you are a bit more in the Robin group, do you feel the Blue Horn got any more or less symbolism compared to the Umbrella? Can't say if I'm biased, but I do feel the umbrella become more iconic. Also, I wonder if there was any meaning to the colors of the items.   And finally, what deleted lunch scene? I probably have to see it."
HIMYM,32k2r0,Seksuaali,1 point,Wed Apr 15 10:24:20 2015 UTC,"Yes you're right, I always liked T&R. But I don't think Blue French Horn was more iconic than Yellow Umbrella. And Ted living the rest of his life with Tracy would've been great too I think. But it made sense that he in the end, got together with robin.  And also the fans have been talking about the meaning of the colors a lot, but I don't think there's a real meaning to them.  You get all the deleted scenes in the dvd box set, but you can see the lunch scene here."
HIMYM,32k2r0,Seksuaali,2,Wed Apr 15 11:29:35 2015 UTC,"Personally I always associated the horn with Ted's failings. It's a symbol of how obsessed with Big Romantic Gestures he is, which ends up backfiring on him more often than it succeeds, culminating with his relationship with Tracey, where he doesn't bother with trying to Prove His Love, he's just himself.  The yellow umbrella, on the other hand, is a symbol of hope, of opportunity, of enduring because the future has good things in store.  That scene where Ted steps outside and everyone is wearing yellow umbrellas, that's one of the most powerful images in the series to me. The blue French horn always just made me think ""damnit, Ted, get over that and over her"".  Then today I saw the finale, which erases all that. Oh, well."
HIMYM,32k2r0,klapaucius,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:14:19 2015 UTC,"Oh, I saw it now, and I think I understand what you are saying.   Yeah, I do feel better about it. The show was a misdirection, but the mother still have been ""The One"""
HIMYM,32k2r0,klapaucius,1 point,Wed Apr 15 11:40:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seems like Ted really got over Robin (at least for the years when he was married to Tracy).  But I didn't like the fact that after Robin divorced Barnie, she immediately goes after Ted and regrets everything. Even though, I think she was happy with her job accomplishments."
HIMYM,32k2r0,Seksuaali,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:42:58 2015 UTC,"I also mentioned it in the OP. I think everything went down hill for her only so Ted would be able to be with Tracy.     Ted already told her there was always only ""top 1"" in his list. She had to distance herself in order for him to move on. By doing that she sacrificed both her marriage and her friendship with most of the gang.   Do you have any idea when the lunch scene happened? how long after the divorce or something?"
HIMYM,32k2r0,Seksuaali,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:55:27 2015 UTC,"The lunch scene happened like the next day when Ted met Robin at the GNB building,so Ted had been engaged with Tracy for 5 years (So, what 6 years from Robin's and Barnie's wedding?).  So yeah, she had been single for 3 years, so I guess she didn't go after Ted right after she got divorced, but it still seems like Barnie didn't matter too much to her. I mean, Ted was together with Tracy and had 2 kids and Barnie was single."
HIMYM,32k2r0,proffessor-westside,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:22:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe other deleted scenes would have made it clearer?  The jumps were quite huge. And usually the writers were quite good at compressing a lots of events into 1 shot scenes. We can see it in the entire season, especially in the ending and ""How you mother met me"". This is what make it weird with all the uncertainty. Maybe there are missing parts and maybe that is part of why these scenes were deleted (or at least, other was chosen over them)"
HIMYM,32k2r0,communitygeek,2,Wed Apr 15 15:52:33 2015 UTC,"I agree, I was really disappointed at the ending... I saw it coming since, as the kids admitted, his storytelling was all about Robin and the Mother was barely in it. Like you, I really really liked Tracy and never really liked Robin (especially not how she acted towards Victoria in season 1, who I also really liked) so I guess I'm just biased in that way.   So I think the ending makes a lot of sense...it's just sucky when you don't agree with it. LOL"
HIMYM,32k2r0,Domyfranky,1 point,Wed Apr 15 07:28:19 2015 UTC,"I think that this was one of the main techniques to make her so likable. We didn't get enough of her, and only of her best moments. Even when she denied the proposal, or get herself super drunk, she was still her usual charming good nature. Which is probably part of what made her end more tragic."

HIMYM,32k2r0,Seksuaali,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:00:43 2015 UTC,"It makes sense from a character perspective in-universe, but as a story that was told to us it's a massive cop-out. Story after story about how Robin represents Ted's desire for a Big Romantic Story with the Love of His Life and how he has to let go of that in order to get where he really needs to be.  Then, wham, Barney and Robin's character development goes away, then, wham, Tracy goes away, and we're left with Ted back where he was in the pilot, except he got the kids Robin couldn't give him and Robin has the solo career she couldn't get with Ted."

HIMYM,32kiwi,TotesMessenger,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:44:24 2015 UTC,"This episode is among the biggest ""love it or hate it""s of the whole show. I personally liked it because it made Quinn into more than some money sucker out of Barney, but something resembling a character.  It's a strange episode, but this is the first of a few that fixes the Ted/Robin friendship. Quinn having the nicest apartment is one of the mysteries that makes me say ""it's a TV show, just like how Robin owned 5 dogs for over 35 episodes."""

HIMYM,32kiwi,mbrw12,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:15:50 2015 UTC,Horrible episode which really shows how tired the whole Barney shtick got by season 7
HIMYM,32irax,nonshyintro,15,Tue Apr 14 02:58:23 2015 UTC,Wasn't that part of his plan in order to get Ted's approval? He decided Robin should go to the building instead of going to his event.
HIMYM,32irax,cintelik,6,Tue Apr 14 03:37:51 2015 UTC,He forced Ted to make a decision; either have his friends there to celebrate the biggest night of his career or to give Robin a chance at happiness. Of course Ted is going to do anything to make Robin happy even if it means sacrificing his. It had nothing to do with Ted giving his blessing to Barney or letting go of Robin
HIMYM,32irax,rose_tattoo,6,Tue Apr 14 11:04:06 2015 UTC,It was 100% to get Ted's blessing. He says that word for word in the episode. The reason he does it is because if Ted sends Robin to meet Barney instead of bringing her to his event it means that he approves. This is very important to Barney because he knows that Ted still has feelings for Robin.
HIMYM,32irax,awesomeness0232,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:57:04 2015 UTC,"Barney assumed that, he couldn't comprehend that Ted did that for Robin and as we saw in later episodes Ted wasn't OK with it"

HIMYM,32irax,Seksuaali,4,Tue Apr 14 08:40:38 2015 UTC,"I've always found it odd because Barney was a senior employee at GNB and was heavily involved in choosing Ted as the architect. So even if he wasn't concerned about supporting Ted as a friend it's strange that he wouldn't turn up to a work event where he would probably have been expected to be a part of the proceedings.   (I know that he subsequently turns out to be less committed to GNB than we had previously believed, but even more reason to go to the opening to keep up the pretense.)"
HIMYM,32irax,TrappedUnderCats,2,Tue Apr 14 16:02:21 2015 UTC,Well he was only a scapegoat / patsy for the company. He probably wasn't invited which is why he chose that night
HIMYM,32irax,rose_tattoo,1 point,Wed Apr 15 22:57:35 2015 UTC,"Yes it was a really shitty thing to do. It was even shittier when he txted Ted about it. Marshall and Lily weren't much better, but at least they showed up for a little while"

HIMYM,32irax,cathysige,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:57:00 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one feel that Barney's been tormenting Ted all these years? He always talks about turning Ted into an awesome man but that's just an excuse to shadow his failure as a normal human being. He's jealous of Ted and craving for a normal life, even though sometimes it means he needs to sabotage Ted's life to get what he wants. I'm not saying Barney's awful, but his legendary life is hardly bearable. It makes good TV, but I do feel bad for Ted."

I loved Barney and Quinn,and yes it was weird to see her fool him like that,and we can totally understand how messed up,needy and vulnerable Barney is in that moment,but anyway i loved their relationship. Ted talking with ghost Robin made me think of the theory about Robin's dead in the finale."

HIMYM,32g2jr,cathysige,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:00:02 2015 UTC,"Quinn, played by Becki Newton, recurs quite a lot for the rest of the season. She eventually was on The Goodwin Games on Fox, which is Bays & Thomas' other short-lived sitcom.  I wish the subplot with Robin was funnier, because a lot of the stuff in the episode is so true about the suburbs... and also shows how unpleasant New Yorkers can be about anywhere but the city at times. Ted and Ghost!Robin was kind of sad in a pathetic way, but it was also somewhat relatable in that it is tough to get over somebody you've had a crush on for a long time. Well yeah Barney, you go to the strip club every night and not only do not recognize her, but don't recognize her tricks that you've probably seen from other strippers? Love makes you stupid, I guess.   I've always been split about whether or not I like Quinn. Barney was always manipulative and conniving, but he's also got real depth and his schemes are cartoonish (aside from season one when he was far more creepy). Quinn never got a chance to develop herself in the episodes she was in, other than being more like Barney than Nora or Robin ever would be. I think part of it may be due to Becki Newton's performance: she falls into ""Kaley Cuoco syndrome"" where something that plays to the laugh track as cute and snarky comes off as bitchy and bitter. Newton just isn't a very good actress."

HIMYM,32bchu,mbrw12,5,Sun Apr 12 10:52:48 2015 UTC,I think the only reason Ted chose that day was because his best friends were getting married and it was the first time he wanted to settle down.
HIMYM,32bchu,Seksuaali,1 point,Sun Apr 12 09:48:31 2015 UTC,This makes me feel like the only reason Robin was the ultimate object of Ted's desire was because she was the first woman he saw after he decided to settle down

HIMYM,32bchu,bludevil22,2,Sun Apr 12 18:40:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure he used that as a reason for using that date. But for Future Ted, it certainly does serve as some sort of affirmation on how destined he and Tracy were for each other, in the sense that both Ted and Tracy start their own journeys toward each other on the same date.  Maybe subconsciously though Ted uses it because of the parallel between his later story and Tracy's. Just like Tracy lost Max and moved on to find somebody new, Ted lost Tracy and has to move on. It's a subconscious way of helping his kids relate to the fact that Ted wasn't Tracy's first love, and adjusting them to the idea of him asking Robin out 6 years after Tracy's death."

Acts as a second part to The Drunk Train, due to Kevin being gone, Ted's immediate aftermath, Barney in Marshall and Lily's pad heh , and Barney still being obsessed with Quinn, who was introduced last episode. Poor Barney. You can see the true heartbreak in his eyes when he recounts everything that happened. I don't believe that's why Robin wasn't attracted to Ted anymore, but it's awful. Yes, this is the episode where Marshall says ""I slap my own ass."" People put this episode with the best of the series, but the subplot is too mean-spirited and out of character. Even for Lily, to bet on their friends' personal lives is pretty messed up, though it's been established that the characters are horrible people from time to time.   Unrequited love sucks, guys. It really sucks. Whether it lasts eight weeks, eight months or eight years, it always hurts. It made Ted do crazy things that are very nice, but his end-goal was tragically unable to be had. People say that these type of nice things are manipulating but being in that position, it really is out of love and not to force somebody to fix your problems. You want to hear about their stories and spend your life with this person and grow in emotional ways, but whether they want nothing to do with you or they truly are not attracted to you and just want to be friends, it hurts. I've always had a soft spot for the Ted-Robin thing because of it. Come season 8... well, that's a different story."

There were multiple cuts/references to Barney when theoretical questions about why Robin wouldn't be with Ted happened.  The reason Robin gave was that Ted represented stability in Robin's life and she just wanted to keep him in his back pocket not complicate things because she didn't love him.  The popular fan theory is that Robin did love him but denied him because she knew Ted wanted kids and Robin knew she could never provide Ted with them.  Of course the real reason it never happened is because the creators already had their plan in place so they couldn't have Ted/Robin backslide again in season 7, but I never knew which answer was the reason Robin said no to Ted, or if it was a mix of all three reasons above."

For the longest time he was who I considered the sensible one in the group until I read this. I didn't even realize how many stupid decisions of his I had missed. Namely, the one about Ted selling the car. Lily has always pissed me (and almost everyone who watches the show) off, and her compulsive need to control makes her just insufferable. Kinda reminds me of Monica towards the end of Friends. But for those hating Lily, I suggest going back and watching S1 over again. That's BY FAR Lily at her most likable, and plus her combined with Marshall (who by the way isn't a pushover yet) make for some really funny and cute moments."

There was an episode where he kept asking Ted over and over how he would react to someone dating his ex, whether he was over Robin, etc. and 'tricked' Ted into saying it would be OK, then his big reveal (which Ted knew all along) was that the real subject of their conversation was Robin.

The reunion is very sweet. PUZZLES IS FINALLY FULLY REALIZED! Aaaaaand it turns out running a bar sucks, a lot. I actually did like Kevin in this episode, as him being awkward and shoehorning himself in is much funnier than him having temper tantrums. This episode finally kickstarts Robin's journalism career. She's been working at WWN with Sandy Rivers, but he blew his career up. Her success eventually becomes incredible, but we'll get to that.

HIMYM,31gfoi,soneverkickadog,8,Tue Apr 7 14:26:14 2015 UTC,"I thought it was good. I wasn't hoping or expecting any particular ending (though I didn't think it would end that way). I think there were multiple plausible, enjoyable ways the show could end. Unlike a lot of people, I was not upset by the pace of the finale. I kinda liked how quickly it moved through everything. I think in some ways it helped set the tone.   I was shocked, and initially mad, but I actually enjoyed the ending. I think it still would've been good if it ended differently, and who knows, maybe it could've been better. But I can't complain.  EDIT: One thing that tends to anger people is the idea that actually Ted loved Robin most the whole time. I disagree with this. In my opinion, the show made it pretty clear that Ted firmly loved Tracy more than anything, anyone, and most of all.....but she died. The fact that Ted ends up reuniting with an old love and good friend doesn't mean Robin was best for him, or they were soul mates. They're still not wildly compatible in a lot of ways. But as you get older, especially if a SO has died, I think it's rather realistic to turn a loving companion into a loving companion if you know what I mean. Another large component of the show is timing. The time of narration is the first real time Robin and Ted can fit into each other's lives without screwing up one or the other's dreams and goals."

HIMYM,31hmvf,MysticGrill,2,Sun Apr 5 04:02:20 2015 UTC,Here are two great tributes for them:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUXVz0u7tVc  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbFM2lUWhI8  I think they were meant to be together but I do agree that it should have been handled better
HIMYM,31hmvf,RusVir,2,Sun Apr 5 15:18:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with Jou95. I've been shipping Ted and Robin since the pilot, cried out of happiness when they ended up together (Hey! Don't judge).   Perhaps the viewers would have connected to the ending more if it didn't seem so rushed. The problem was the execution, not the twist.  Somebody on this sub posted a finale they edited, which I thought was fitting. You should try that out. :)"

HIMYM,31g6ix,rhcp88,2,Sat Apr 4 19:54:56 2015 UTC,"Ted seemingly valued Robin over the mother   I don't agree that Ted love Robin more than Tracy. I think both Robin and Tracy, were loves of Ted's life, but in very different way.   The audience falls in love with her—and then in the last five minutes, we learn she dies and BOOM, Ted is off to declare his love for Robin. (Although years have passed since Tracy’s death.) But for us, the fans, we have ZERO time to mourn.   The show focused on the good things from the relationship between Ted and Tracy, not for example the sad times after her ted, which I liked."
HIMYM,31g6ix,Seksuaali,2,Sat Apr 4 22:26:22 2015 UTC,I literally just finished the series again this morning and while I agree they glossed over the mother's story with Ted (I wish we got at least a season to get to know her) I'm not really bummed that it ends the way it does. We probably didn't get to know Tracy very well because the writers didn't want people to get too attached to her before she dies and Ted moves on to Robin.

HIMYM,31he37,Seksuaali,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:03:48 2015 UTC,"The finale wouldn't have worked if the show were like this. The point is that the story wasn't about the Mother, it was about Ted and Robin (but it doesn't mean Ted didn't love the Mother, it's just that he was telling the story because he was contemplating getting back with Robin).  Anyway, what you described is actually what the premise of How I Met Your Dad was going to be - the main character meets the ""Dad"" in the first episode, but doesn't actually fall in love with him until the end."
HIMYM,31he37,RusVir,1 point,Sun Apr 5 19:05:45 2015 UTC,"I understand the show, as constructed, wouldn't work this way, I'm simply saying the show as a whole would have been better if it was.  When I watched in the earlier season I always thought we'd meet the mother, but the show would still go on for a few more seasons to develop their relationship.  Like I said before they were always willing to stretch the premise to allow the show to continue (again see season 3 premiere where Bob Saget basically says ""I'm gonna tell you a bunch of other shit instead of actually how I met your mom"")."
HIMYM,31he37,RusVir,3,Sun Apr 5 19:12:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would have been better, that would have made it just another cliche romance, because we would all know they're going to end up getting married and have kids. What made HIMYM unique was Ted chasing after ""Aunt"" Robin, who we knew he is NOT going to end up with (or so we thought).  Anyway your first argument in the post was   I think the real problem with the final was the mother should have been a permanent cast member from the very beginning.   So I was saying no, that would not have worked for the finale."

HIMYM,31fpr7,RusVir,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:48:59 2015 UTC,"Another user in another post asked to me ""Where was this audience for The Goodwin Games?"" but The Goodwin Games was already canceled before to go on air (Fox canceled it after 7 episodes,while they were shooting it)so it's not audience's fault. It was just that Fox didn't believe in the project anymore (and they were wrong,because TGG was a great series). I think the finale already damaged Bays and Thomas,because i really think that CBS canceled HIMYD mostly because of the complains about the HIMYM finale. And i also heard that DVD sales for the season 9 weren't very good (but i don't have official numbers to confirm it). I really think that the most devoted fans were the B-R shippers,they were always supportive of the show and defended it from the criticism trough the years,they bought the merchandising,and now...they just hates Bays and Thomas so much (because let's be honest,it's ok for Barney and Robin to divorce,but it was too rushed,and after the divorce Barney and Robin almost never interacted at all.It was like their relationship never existed,and of course they took this like a betrayal to this fandom). So i really think that Bays and Thomas wants to find a new audience,they already said on Twitter a few weeks ago that they want to write for cable tv,and not for the network tv."
HIMYM,31fpr7,RusVir,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:28:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think CBS really cared about the negative response to the finale, all they cared was that it got the highest viewership. And they didn't outright reject HIMYD, they tested the pilot and asked them to redo it, but C&C said no. DVD sales for season 9 weren't very good because well, let's face it the season wasn't very good. But the complete series box set probably must have sold more.  Every show always has to find its own audience, it doesn't depend on the creator's previous audience. Sure, it's a start, when their new show comes out Himym fans will be the first to check it out, but ultimately the audience will be formed by whoever the show appeals to. It depends on individuals' interest in the plot, setting, style etc.  I think they want to write for cable TV because it would allow them more creative freedom and flexibility, and that would be great. I mean, imagine if Himym had been a cable show, I think it would have been even more awesome, they could have done a lot more things with it. Maybe even made the finale of proper length instead of truncating it to fit a one-hour slot. Great shows like Breaking Bad could only be made on cable. I really think Bays and Thomas are capable of reaching that level."

HIMYM,319qsk,gizmo1492,6,Fri Apr 3 03:09:12 2015 UTC,"Well, I think that Ted says that because he finally could take the leap. After so many years of saying what he has to do, what the so called ""dream"" was, like being an architect, have his own firm, and that a teaching job is for when you don't have anything else left. He matures a lot by taking the leap, and he starts to learn to take more risks, and pursue his own happiness rather than stick with a plan. I always see that he refers to that moment as great discovery of what he really want, and what he really loves to do."
HIMYM,319qsk,jtbatman,2,Fri Apr 3 05:15:35 2015 UTC,"He said that because he's a widower. This is what I realized rewatching the show after the finale, noticing how some of the things Future Ted says are so poignant and moving, like this and the 45 days speech. Now we know why, it's because his wife has died and he is sad and lonely. That's why he's so nostalgic of the past.  I mean if she wasn't dead, he wouldn't have called it the best year of his life. He said that to stress how grateful he was that all that suffering led him to Tracy. If Tracy were still alive, he would have talked in a lighter way.  Anyway, the real best year of Ted's (and Tracy's) life was 2021, as he says in Rally."
HIMYM,319jx4,i_cant_find_a_name,12,Fri Apr 3 02:08:39 2015 UTC,"Three days. See, when Robin came over to Ted's house for dinner, she hinted that she was ready to get back with him and asked him to call her. But Ted had to wait three days to call, because the three days rule. So he decided to pass the time by telling the story to his kids."
HIMYM,319jx4,RusVir,8,Fri Apr 3 16:48:28 2015 UTC,"I always took it as we see things Ted doesn't tell the kids. Like he will say ""And then Marshall and I fought each other with the swords, eventually Lily walked in, the coffee table broke under Marshall and she got stabbed in the shoulder. Was not pleased kids""  So it takes 12 seconds to say, but is 6 minutes on screen. The only things we know for sure Ted says to the kids is the narration we hear."

HIMYM,317b40,CindersRojas,4,Thu Apr 2 15:46:22 2015 UTC,"While I do agree with most of what you said, I'm going to have to disagree with what you said about Ted. You make it sound as if Ted immediately went back to Robin after Tracy passing. No, he grieved for six years. Six years is a long time and even though Ted wasn't explicitly shown grieving in the last episode, I really don't think its fair to portray Tracy as just another girl in Ted's life.  And how did Ted undo all the lessons that he learnt? With Ted finally letting go of Robin during Barney's wedding, he was able to fully commit to Tracy when he meant her.  'Vesuvius' and 'The Time Travelers' are a clear indication of what Tracy meant to Ted. When you watch the season 9 extras where Robin runs into Ted when he was still with Tracy and she confesses that she still has feelings for Ted, you see Ted respond by saying that he's happy with Tracy. We don't see that same old Ted who was always in love with Robin. Instead, you see a Ted who finally moved on and who doesn't have any second thoughts about choosing Tracy.   About Ted not being a good man for Robin, I'm pretty sure the reason why Ted and Robin broke up in the first place was due to them wanting different things in life at that time. Sure, you could say that they did have their little problem in the episode where Ted was supposed to move in with Robin but I'm pretty sure they moved past that and continued dating. So when Ted finally met Robin, the problems that they had that caused them to break up in the first place (Robin wanting to travel; Ted wanting kids) were more or less resolved. That's not to say that Tracy's sole role was just to provide Ted with kids so he could move on the Robin. Tracy will always be The One. And now that I think of it, that scene in Time Travelers towards the end where Ted gave the speech really emphasizes that she will be the one that he always loved and will continue loving for the rest of his life. And I guess you could say that it was the one and only grieving scene that we get to see of Ted after Tracy's death.  I do agree with what you said about Robin though. I would have preferred to see her being developed a bit more. I myself am not a big fan of the finale. I really wanted (and still do) Ted to end up with Tracy and for it to be a happily-ever-after ending. And I also agree with what you said about Barney and Robin's relationship. With Barney moving on from his playboy life, I guess I too expected Robin to be a little less career oriented. That's just my take on it, I doubt there's really a right or wrong answer to any of this."
HIMYM,317b40,Snycs,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:03:33 2015 UTC,"Well said.  And looking back, I totally agree with you on Time Travelers and Vesuvius in particular being the points where Ted grieved for his long dead wife.  It was tough to see that at the time of the finale's airing though.  That is why the finale is generally poorly received, in my humble opinion......"
HIMYM,317b40,Ericws,0,Thu Apr 9 17:48:08 2015 UTC,"And I also agree with what you said about Barney and Robin's relationship. With Barney moving on from his playboy life, I guess I too expected Robin to be a little less career oriented. That's just my take on it, I doubt there's really a right or wrong answer to any of this.    Barney isn't interested in just one woman, he likes the variety. The deleted scenes from Sunrise clearly shows the realization on Barney's face. Much like the Sexless Innkeeper epsiode  We have know from the very first episode that Robins career was important to her. We also knew from ""Something Blue"" Future Ted tells us that Robin does go and live in Greece, Morocco etc. We also knew from Symphony of Illumination that Robin does become a famous journalist and a successful business woman.   So to say that you expected Robin to be less career oriented proves you weren't paying attention to the story"

HIMYM,317b40,Snycs,2,Fri Apr 3 06:10:01 2015 UTC,Robins character was destroyed long before the finale. Barney and Robin were a train wreck and ruined the last part of the show for me. I started watching the show for Teds story the it all started to focus on Barney. So I'm glad they sort of fixed it at the end.
HIMYM,317b40,rose_tattoo,0,Thu Apr 2 15:57:49 2015 UTC,"I feel like Barney was written off too at the end; yes, he had an amazing part with the baby. But that too was after all these unknown women. He went back to just banging random chicks and didn't even want the child until he held her. The divorce/marriage to Robin didn't leave him changed (and neither did a decade apparently), he just reverted to playboy and then reverted back to good human being when he got a daughter.   The end of the series was already miserable, ruining several key parts of characters. To have to sit through all that and still get that ending was terrible!"
HIMYM,317b40,Justice_Prince,-2,Thu Apr 2 17:06:31 2015 UTC,"I heard a theory that actually makes Barney's story a lot better.  First assume the he actually did want a child.  That's actually the real reason he broke up with Robin.  Also Barney isn't actually able to have children, and that's why none of his other sexual encounters ended in accidental pregnancies.    Barney who is a fan of elaborate lies descended to trick his friends into thinking that his adopted child was actually his real child.  There was perfect month, and he went through 31 pregnant women before he found one that would agree to let him adopt her child, and participate in his con.  I've got my own theory too where Tracy never died, but rather ran off after having a brush with death.  This takes assuming that Ted was lying about what a great person she was, but if you watch the episode they never actually say she died.  I think this makes Ted & Tracy's story a lot more satisfying.  I don't know of any theories to make Robin's story better though."

Over the years the same, only thing that made them not good together was Robin not wanting to settle down and have a family. Finally on 2030 she was ready in my opinion. Why wouldn't it work?  I think Ted had 2 Lebenslangerschicksalsschatz (lifelong treasure of destiny), Tracy and Robin."

HIMYM,313ew4,Ludachriz,3,Thu Apr 2 15:34:04 2015 UTC,"I've been smoking daily for a couple of years now (to help with my social anxiety/depression). I feel like the stoners depicted in television/movies or in general are not realistic. I haven't been paranoid since the first month of smoking and no matter how much I smoke I won't loose any grasp on reality. Reading your comment I can only think that you don't smoke that often because feeling relax and less stressed are the standard effects of most cannabis (ofc some exceptions depending on the strain) and feeling paranoid and restless are common things to experience when being new to marijuana, often caused by smoking to much, not being used to it  or just having a bad trip. These things go away the more you smoke however, you kinda build up a defense for it and that's why people who smoke regularly don't often associate cannabis with paranoia or social anxiety while people who only smoke occasionally or have just tried it a couple of times associate it with that.   Sorry for the wall of text I hope it makes sense."
HIMYM,313ew4,FrobozzMagic,2,Thu Apr 2 15:53:16 2015 UTC,"Oh, I used to smoke a lot in college. I had to give it up, though, because it was making me depressed and anxious and it just became impossible to actually do anything. Tasks like walking across (a very small) campus were so daunting, it was impossible to do work of any kind, my heart would beat very quickly and weakly, and I would experience really problematic patterns of thought, like stress and despair and self-deprecation.  I think these effects are actually quite common, just not among people who smoke regularly because when those are the effects it has on you, you don't smoke regularly."

HIMYM,3125rn,jelatinman,8,Wed Apr 1 14:25:38 2015 UTC,"Ow, my heart.   Everybody in this episode wears purple except for Barney and Robin. Interesting stylistic choice that the cheating just happened suddenly and abruptly, rather than having a long foreshadowed buildup. The threshold of rooting for a cheater: if they take responsibility for their actions and how much you like the character with one person or another. Jim and Pam of The Office started from cheating, but everyone cheered because her boyfriend was a negative, violently angry jerk. Here, Barney jumps through hoops with Robin and they both look like complete assholes. That is, until Barney unexpectedly owns up to it and ends his relationship to try something that he really wants. This is the most mature Barney has ever been or will ever be. Robin was planning on doing it, but ran into the safe and reliable comfort rather than taking a risk. Which leads to... Holy crap Kevin, you're a psychopath. Kevin knows Robin's issues with confronting her feelings and her insecurities, so he manipulates a situation that could have ended in a breakup into a desperate cling to her. You'd rather live happily in denial of anything wrong than actually discuss what could be a very serious thing for Robin. You're a jerk. ""Lily doesn't even know I'm high."" Barney's cold stare, the moment that would never end, seeing the one woman he loves cruelly reject him after all that he did for her, is the saddest and most real moment of the whole show. Like I've said before, if Ted brings out much of happiness from the good and bad of life, Barney shows how cruel and awful it can be."

It would make sense for Marshall to go back to corporate, for Lily to feel guilty about ruining Marshall's life again (albeit temporarily), for Robin to succeed and still regret her choices, for Barney to slip back and only permanently change when he had a daughter, and for Ted to cling onto Tracy six years after death."
HIMYM,30wwsc,jelatinman,16,Tue Mar 31 16:58:49 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's been a year, but I'm still kind of pissed. Bays and Thomas obliterated the character arcs of 60% of the cast in that finale. Barney, Ted, and Robin all had journeys that ended up being pointless because the secret moral of the series is that people don't change in any substantial way.   22 episodes of a weekend wedding, then it's all undone in 20 minutes. Mother dies of a vague, unspecified illness so that Ted and Robin, a pairing that was definitely closed off with the worst CGI balloon person of all time comes back into play as the supposed endgame of the series. Lily delivers a ""poingnant"" speech looking like a sperm. ""A lot of stuff"" is supposed to be a heartwarming line. Barney's character is thrown out and then suddenly an accidental pregnancy magically changes him when NINE FUCKING YEARS of character development failed to do that.  This finale is pathetic. Carter and Bays are good storytellers but end their stories like mediocre fan fiction writers who can't get over the fact that Ted and Robin broke up in season 2."

HIMYM,30wwsc,Domyfranky,4,Tue Mar 31 13:37:07 2015 UTC,The ending could have worked. What should have happened was the show should have ended in Season 8. The Season 9 finale should have just been a TV movie. Also you guys should watch the table read for the finale there was some good stuff that got cut and some of that stuff made the finale feel more whole. At first I was really upset but now that I've had time to process I'm still disappointed but I understand what they were going for.

IMO, I think this is why you still hate the finale. I really suggest you to watch it again. Because I hated it the first time too, but after rewatching it it got better, and still does for me. Again IMO, the finale has so much in it that it needs to be watched multiple times to be fully digested. Then you realize it ties with the show very well.

HIMYM,30xwsi,maverickLI,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:36:20 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way.  I had a pretty good feeling that Tracy was going to be revealed as dead in the finale.  I was hoping for another 15-20 more minutes with Tracy to ""feel"" her relationship with Ted a little more.    I still think that the writers could have, and should have, given us that- they could have easily fit all of that in and still had their overall story line for every character.  I feel much better about the overall plot and the ""myth"" of the show as time goes by.  But I still think that the writers could have told their own legen-wait for it- dary story better."
HIMYM,30xwsi,Ericws,1 point,Wed Apr 1 14:27:27 2015 UTC,"They could have even made the 2nd to last episode all about Ted and the Mother, but then many fans would say that they fell in love with her character and then she was killed off in the next episode.

She'd be great in sitcoms. As unrealistic as this episode may be, this was a necessary plot thread to end for fans. Ted's romanticism is deconstructed in that his anticipation killed his enthusiasm (and ergo her's). Ted has held out for so many false hopes that ultimately it kills his chances at love. I appreciate any and all references to Rocky IV, the best of the Rocky series outside of the original. ""Living in America..."" If nothing else, I like that Barney and the group actually do accept Jerry since at least Robin is Facebook friends with him. Lily and Marshall officially own this house for a little while after this episode. They don't get it now but they do eventually. With how cheap the house is, it actually does make sense to try to move to the suburbs. It's a really nice house and has a nice community. Apparently ""pregnancy brain"" Lily is based on how absentminded Alyson Hannigan really gets when she's pregnant."

Plus, unlike Stella or Zoe it's not like the Slutty Pumpkin did anything that hurt Ted personally, they just realized the two weren't compatible in the end."

The thing is sitcoms were already an outdated genre twenty years ago when Friends started. People don't laugh the same way and of the same jokes. That's why I will always say HIMYM is superior: it's an homage to sitcoms more than an actual sitcom, self-aware but never in a pretentious way. So it's likely to age better."

Barney and Robin come back together? awesome! but i would like to see it! not only their looks and FT saying ""people falls apart but maybe they come back together"".

Ted getting back with Robin did not flow with the show after like season 6 pretty much.  The show evolved and the writers tried to shove it back into the box they wanted. Not the one it deserved and needed.  Obviously the finale in general had scores of issues.  And the future timeline should have been the entire season, not the wedding.  The whole process they did to end it was just poorly executed.  But I think through all of that, the alternate is the best and closest to the real ending for the series."

The important stuff can be crapped out in like a minute.   Field Trip: Kevin and Robin are dating, yay!...? Mystery vs. History: Ted dated a black girl! Oh, and Lily and Marshall are having a boy. I found that Kevin was fine with Robin, but his very presence severely threw the group off in a way that hasn't been seen since Don. Is it a mean thing to say his voice may be part of it? He's extremely serious compared to most of them but constantly has to throw temper tantrums. ""I just want somebody to curl up and watch Annie Hall with me!"" I feel like this girl could be the perfect match found in season 1 that Ted skipped out on. I personally appreciated the gang's traits being deconstructed by Kevin, showing how codependent, socially awkward, invasive, narcissistic and just plain weird the group can be. But I'm a sucker for psychology type things. Deconstruction is a big theme in this season, done at a slow pace.  A yellow room would have been fine if it were golden, but that bright yellow is an ugly color.  What's funny is that I find that ""look people up before you go out with them"" thing already a bit antiquated. You seem like a total stalker if you look up their interests on Facebook (as opposed to an actual online dating site). Most people I've seen talk to the one they like in person or text, see a couple of pictures and statuses, and go on the date. Or get all insecure and become super stalker as detailed in a good Aziz Ansari bit, but still, not really checking interests."

And thank God, thank every god there is, or ever was, or will be, and the whole universe, and anyone else I could possibly thank, that I was too lazy to do so, stumbled upon this, and decided to watch it.   You took an ending which was for me (and many, many others) easily the biggest letdown in TV history (not to mention the frankly insulting-to-the-viewers alternate ending), and made it into, in my completely non-hesitant opinion, the most emotionally satisfying end to a TV show, ever. Forget Breaking Bad's ""Felina"", even forget the end of Parks and Recreation. This is how you bring an end to a series. How you managed do so much with so few edits is really incredible.

The reminder of Ted and Robins intensity, the recap with the mother telling Ted life only moves forward.  That chemistry / timing line from Robin was perfect, that's exactly what needed to be said and I think may be the most important line alongside the no longer wondering ""what if"" speech.  It lets us know that it was all pure, the situations that led to this ending were impartial.  The official ending just felt like the mother got thrown under the bus so Ted could finally be with Robin, like they forced that plot point to make an ending happen but this makes it play out so much more naturally and honestly.  And it was all there, we already knew all of this, it was just presented so poorly originally.  This really makes me realize how awfully they handled the ending.  They had everything they needed right there.  Bravo man, I'm very happy I got to see this.  So much more powerful than the original."
HIMYM,30hef3,brownj99,54,Fri Mar 27 22:29:23 2015 UTC,"Be sure to watch all the way to the very end because I honestly think the final frame is my favorite addition. Feel free to share this with anyone you'd like as well as the password for access but please give credit to Tristan Frower; me.   The finale of HIMYM was beautiful but it wasn't completely presented in the most beautiful way. However, I realized that not too many additional scenes were needed in order to make it work a little better. In fact, no new scenes were needed at all. (However, the deleted scenes have been incorporated [including the cafe scene between Ted & Robin which IS rather important])  Through a bit of editing magic, I kept the writers' original ending but shifted it around a bit so that the kids were placed in a better light and Ted's final decision made a bit more sense. I wanted to show that Tracy really WAS a special part of Ted's life and certainly not a place holder until Robin was available again.   Please enjoy and let me know what you think. I've made the video available for download so you can save it before it gets taken down. Please also tell me what you're favorite added part was.

HIMYM,30hef3,Morningxafter,39,Fri Mar 27 12:12:14 2015 UTC,"I was always a fan of the original finale. While it's heartbreaking what happens with Tracy, I get the same thing the kids do, that the story is more about him and Robin finally getting together when the timing is right. The Cafe scene is super important and really gets that point across. The only problem I had with it was it felt so rushed, ""Here it is, the moment he meets her! Aaaaaaand.... she's gone.""   That said, yours doesn't feel rushed at all. You really see that they led a pretty full and happy life together, and you really get the feeling that Tracy would be happy for him to finally move on when he's ready. This is definitely my new favorite version. Thank you for sharing this. I'm going to download it and put it with all the seasons on my hard drive and label it ""Best Ending""."

HIMYM,30hef3,juaninamil,3,Fri Mar 27 19:50:46 2015 UTC,In my opinion the reason behind spending most of the season on barney and robins wedding is because ted and Tracy only truly met because of it.

Yet, I don't completely agree that it was all about building to their wedding weekend.   A lot of stuff happened in the last season in between the wedding shenanigans. We got to see Ted go through one of the biggest challenges of his life, got to see how many little things can happen over a tiny weekend to make sure someone ends up at the right place and the right time.   And, as sad as it is, the last season proved to me that Barney and Robin don't work. They love each other and that's a given. But throughout the season, we saw proof that they rarely consult each other on decisions, honesty is here and there (that issue appears to get fixed though), and they fight.... a lot. Seriously, they get into a lot of arguments throughout season 9 and when you consider the fact that this is only over the span of two days, it makes you wonder how meant for each other they truly are.   Again, they do love each other and I love them as a couple but they aren't meant to spend the rest of their lives together."

Your ending was a lot better. I was either similing or tearing up through the entire piece. Great work, your edit showed excellent understanding of the storyline. You delivered every event that happened in the original series with the exact same story line (unlike alternate ending), the only differnce being your episode was far smoother in developing the intended series ending where ted gets together with robin.

HIMYM,30hef3,FellKnight,2,Sat Mar 28 06:51:57 2015 UTC,"I was late to watch it but anyway, excellent work! Great effort. Looks like you've managed to turn a lot of fans around on the ending. Now, I don't mean to criticize your edit, but I just have a few suggestions to make it even better and more professional.   The deleted scenes are a little dull in appearance. I don't know if this is possible, but it would be great if you could color-correct them to better blend in with the main episode. The cut from the high infinity scene to the Let's go to the mall scene is a little abrupt. I think you removed the ""Worth it - So worth it"" part because it dissolves into the train station scene, but maybe you could try to get it back in. In the Let's go to the mall scene you've included a close-up shot of Tracy, I think it would be nice if immediately after this you added the shot of Ted watching her which is found in s8e13 'Band Or DJ'. Based on this comment, I think it would be great to enhance Marshall's ""Just all kinds of stuff"" by having a brief montage of all the great and cool things that happened in the bar just before that line. The montage should be silent and quick-cut. Include this picture (can't find a better quality right now) at the beginning of the Tracy photo montage. It's supposedly from a deleted clip of Ted and Tracy getting into Ranjit's limo right after their wedding. You cut out parts of the kids' dialogues to make them seem less rude - I never thought of that! However, I think you should have left in this part: ""What I just call her up on the phone and ask her out on a date?"" ""Yes."" ""And that's something you guys would want?"" ""YES!"" Because one of the main reasons Ted gets back with Robin is because the kids want them to be together. The Lily paying up Marshall scene should be moved to the very end, after the text credits. Your watermark kind of comes in the way of watching the video. You could move it to a corner like a TV channel logo.   Also, please do upload the music pieces from the finale that you singled out."

HIMYM,30hef3,IdleScV,2,Sat Mar 28 01:02:17 2015 UTC,"You have no idea how perfect this was. When I first saw the HIMYM finale I wasn't moved. Sure I was upset that my favorite show was ending (who isn't sad about change?), but the ending didn't do it for me. It seemed that robin and Ted simply weren't supposed to be together. I was too upset and it was too hard to process all of the break ups and then Tracy's death.  But watching it now, a year later with an older perspective, I can appreciate how magical the idea is. And your edit truly showed the magic that, in my opinion, the shows creators did not manage to capture. This moved me to tears through the many different ways. The ending, with the flashback especially (where Tracy says ""life must move forward"") helped me understand that there really was a moving on process (something that the audience wasn't able to fully comprehend).  This is a beautiful show, and I'd say that this IS the final episode!"

HIMYM,30l0ma,do_not_ask_my_name,5,Sat Mar 28 08:21:43 2015 UTC,"My headcanon is that Ted call the kids home after school and started to tell them the story of how he met their mother.  The kids were in their pilot clothes during well... The pilot. The pilot is the most important because as we know now the point of the story is Ted's connection to Aunt Robin. That being said, Ted probably took the longest to tell this portion of the story.   Then he decided he would take a break from telling the story and pick it up a few days later.   The furniture also looks different.  Of course the real reason is because the producers didn't know whether they were going to get picked up or not so they didn't need this to look too fancy.  However, I decided to make up a deeper reason. I believe after Tracy passed away, he rearranged the living room because seeing it preserved in the way that he and Tracy enjoyed it for so many years hurt too much.  However, now that he was ready to move on but still keep the memory of he and his wife time together, he decided to put it back the way that she and him liked it.  So after he and the kids rearranged the furniture and the kids got into some more comfortable clothes, he started taking up the story again which is why his first line in the next episode is "" alright, where was I?""   The story from there starts relatively early in the morning and finishes later that night when Ted is convinced by the kids to go after aunt Robin.  Hope this gives you something to become your head canon as well."
HIMYM,30l0ma,Swankified_Tristan,1 point,Sat Mar 28 13:13:12 2015 UTC,"Good one. You have a great imagination, you write fan-fiction?  Anyway, your theory brought me to the question, how long did it actually take for Ted to narrate the ENTIRE story?  I'm guessing he wouldn't have gone into too many details, inappropriate details like his sexual activities.And I think Vesuvius was the only episode not actually narrated? And I suppose each episode must take at least 10 minutes to summarize...  Leaving out the Pilot from your theory that it happened on a different day, and Vesuvius because it had no voice over gives us 206 episodes.  And the kids don't change clothes after Purple Giraffe, which means the rest of the narration took place over a day.  206 X 10 = 2060 minutes.  2060/60 = 34 hours.  34 hours.  One and a half days. And this is simply the time-span that excludes meals, toilet-break, shower, and generally a life outside the couch.  Goddammit Ted."

I think this is the episode that convinced me that Barney's shenanigans are an exaggeration made to make a point that Barney was a bad womanizer, albeit with extensive connections. Believing in my happy delusional world let's me accept the fact that Survivor was once sponsored by the boob doctor. I always wished the show would explore Robin's therapy more, or at least gotten Ted in it. Especially in this season, Ted had some serious issues to work out. He built a fucking skyscraper and is still having issues with abandonment. No Lily, you ignorant slut, don't listen to Dr. Sonya.

So I've been planning this out for a while now but have never been able to act on it since I had no way of getting the finale in a format that was able to be edited.   I finally sucked it up and just bought myself a DVD ripper and I have to say it's probably one of the greatest purchases I've ever made.  The finale of How I Met Your Mother was beautiful. But the way that it was presented took away from its beauty. So through a bit of editing magic, I have put together an ending that will remain both true to the fans and the writers.  I won't give too much away but I will say that the scene between Ted and the kids is still there but has been edited in a way where its a bit more emotional and for lack of better phrasing, doesn't make the children look like such assholes.  The decision that Ted makes in the end becomes more understandable and while there isn't too much added time, it definitely doesn't feel as rushed.  Its taken some planning, some DVD ripping, and some music finding, but I hope you will all be very pleased. Have a nice day, everyone!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I hope to make you all cry very soon.  Here is a VERY small preview. This is what the opening will look like!  http://redd.it/306ew3   or go right to the video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIj01Xa09ZU  Update: the first cut has rendered and I watched it. For the most part, it looks great but there are a few things that I need to work on. For one, the big ending scene that I've reedited, you know, the most important part, is completely blacked out. So I need to fix that. The music needs a bit of readjusting and there's something that I want to add in at the beginning.   I want to assure you all though that I'm still working on it and to let you know where its progress is at. I'll keep you each posted. Promise.  Update: It's finished. Will be trying to upload tomorrow or today (depending on when you're reading this.)  FINALE UPDATE:  Here it is!

HIMYM,305m7e,Fajkowsky,3,Wed Mar 25 13:51:25 2015 UTC,"Being honest here. I unfortunately don't. It is indeed for personal use and acts more of a dedication to the writers, producers, and of course the fans.   It all started when I finally convinced my girlfriend to watch HIMYM with me. She of course got really into it and we're already to Season 6.   It occurred to me that I had a vision for a different ending that was still staying true to Craig and Carter's vision. Because Craig and Carter's vision is beautiful. It just wasn't presented in the right way.   I wanted my girlfriend to see a finale that put Craig and Carter's writing in the proper lighting. And then midway through the process I realized that it was turning out better than I'd expected and knew that the community would also like to see it.   It is my hope that maybe one day the producers WILL see it and they'll think of it as a compliment.   I have no interest in gaining any money or fame from this. I just want to share my editing capabilities and enjoy the finale that we all deserve as fans.   Edit: We might have a breakthrough. Person I'm connected with is connected to Craig Thomas.

Not a fan of the related boobs storyline. Ridiculously cheap and boring.  Victoria is still a darling in this episode, until her reapparance in the season finale after which they had to get rid of her somehow and ended up demonizing her. I suppose they wanted to give resolution to her character, but sometimes things are better off as they are. She was the only ex who seemed like a real person, the only girlfriend who wasn't a villain. Her coming back in Season 8 became such a half-assed waste of time.  Mixed feelings on Ted here, as usual. Trying to redeem himself, yet ending up an asshole.  Loved the list of Ted's past girlfriends, and the bang-bang song made a pleasant return!"

I've always been confused as to whether Ted cheated on Victoria. He was convinced they broke up, so he took the plunge, so he accidentally cheated? Ted just says he cheated.  I think this is Barney's greatest con in the entire series, even beating the eventual big one. Six years of Pavlovian conditioning, six months learning to cook a food style he hates, and getting the chef to go along with it, then Lily inadvertently give into what Barney truly wanted. Though he was trying to be with Nora, which makes it a ""what the hell dude"" moment, I liked it for how in depth it got.  No, we don't see Lily's boobs because Ted somehow never had. Even in college.  Victoria is getting married! Ted seriously screwed up her feelings. She never could quite get over him.  Bless you."

HIMYM,301eth,G8kpr,2,Tue Mar 24 21:12:32 2015 UTC,that's crazy. They sure as hell don't look nearly ten years older.
HIMYM,301eth,rib-bit,61,Tue Mar 24 02:52:12 2015 UTC,"I always thought Marshal and Barney change the most.

He looked too young and fresh-faced or something with that old haircut.    I'd argue that Marshall changed the most throughout the series, what with weight loss/gain, hair length changes, etc.  If someone has watched the series enough times, they could probably do a pretty good guess on which season an episode is in just based on a random shot of Marshall."
HIMYM,301eth,MissRepresentation,8,Mon Mar 23 19:52:10 2015 UTC,Lily too because of her ever-changing hair.

You can really tell because of the forehead wrinkles. I mean he's still hot, but the forehead wrinkles are what gives his age away.

HIMYM,301eth,northenden,9,Mon Mar 23 19:04:48 2015 UTC,They got older and got better stylists it seems. It's most noticeable in Cobie I think
HIMYM,301eth,ThisDerpForSale,1 point,Mon Mar 23 21:23:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe that comes with fame?   Nope, that comes with money. By the end of the show they would have all visited a stylist before stepping out, and would have all been taking much better care of themselves health-wise vs. the time when the show started... Jason and Alyson notwithstanding as they went into it with moderately good careers."
HIMYM,301eth,ranchdepressing,3,Tue Mar 24 13:20:29 2015 UTC,Jason Segel changed the most when he stopped drinking IRL mid-series. He lost a bunch of weight and started looking fit again.
HIMYM,301eth,Semper-Fido,2,Mon Mar 23 23:12:01 2015 UTC,"So . . . I gotta say, they didn't really change that much.  Sure, change their hairstyle/color, give or take away facial hair, gain or lose a little weight. . . but overall, they didn't  really change that much."
HIMYM,301eth,tholgrr,2,Tue Mar 24 01:36:58 2015 UTC,"When is ""then?"" How old are these pictures?  Analysis: Josh discovered blotting papers, got a few wrinkles, looks pretty much the same and ironically more like a professor.   Cobie looks the same age, more or less, but upped her makeup game. Neil looks like he went from civilian to military.   Jason aged well, looking leaner, tanner and healthier. Would not say it looks like a 10 year difference. He also has more hair, possibly altering his hairline.  Hard to judge Alyson because the lighting in her ""before"" is so generous. She definitely looks older, but still doesn't look her age (40.)"
HIMYM,301eth,muffin_sangria,2,Tue Mar 24 02:24:49 2015 UTC,Josh Radnor looking classy as fuck
HIMYM,301eth,r_skyward91,6,Tue Mar 24 03:04:54 2015 UTC,Am I the only one getting a sense of subtle nose work from the ladies? Or is just lighting and angles? Either way they still look great!
HIMYM,301eth,tahonng,4,Mon Mar 23 20:55:34 2015 UTC,It could be makeup too.  Contouring had become more and more of a thing.
HIMYM,301eth,OrdigitalGngstr,3,Tue Mar 24 04:21:07 2015 UTC,"If you compare Alyson from the earlier seasons to now, you can see see an obvious change in her nose, especially her profile. It looks like she got her bridge done."
HIMYM,301eth,ThisDerpForSale,2,Tue Mar 24 06:02:14 2015 UTC,"I was getting it from Cobie. Looks like the tip of her nose is slightly narrower, maybe. It's a slightly different angle, but I don't think that would account for it."

Worst play Barney has ever done: dress up in blackface to get a girl who only dated black guys, and call himself Barno. But she reached for the check... Barney really did grow up, didn't he?

I like how we've used /r/HIMYM to follow and support Carter and Craig with their recent projects, as well as hunt down deleted scenes, but I feel like we could use something more to work for and keep experiencing this story together in new ways.

HIMYM,300mgz,do_not_ask_my_name,5,Mon Mar 23 17:41:43 2015 UTC,"So many things in this episode!   Mosbius Designs has failed. Surprisingly popular in Finland! Once again the gang ends up in Cleveland for a wedding they probably shouldn't have been invited to, aside from Ted.  I like Barney's idea of using off-market research to find out what plays may or may not work, even if it just is to distract himself from Nora not calling.  Robin still likes Barney! She looked great during the dance. I like her shorter, bushier cut.  Marshall and Lily are having a baby. Marshall gets so drunk to compensate he ruins the wedding. He almost falls in the cake, almost hits someone with a football... But accidentally revealed Punchy's wedding was a shotgun wedding of sort because the woman was pregnant.  Never mentioned in the previous episode that Barney's the groom of the future wedding. It took a pretty long time to reveal who the bride was."

The show has always been terrible with legal stuff. Zoey's tape would be withheld evidence, right? Not even acknowledging how Ted changed his mind? Furthermore, the removal of the Lion head was a genius move, highly illegal, highly unlikely (seriously, save a building for a lion head?). And though I hated Zoey in this episode, I always felt like this episode was too cruel of an exit to go on. Since her movement failed, Ted's career is amazing. Now she's divorced and broke on top of that. Yippee? Marshall still doesn't go back to GNB, and in fact starts his environmental kick soon after losing this case.

As badly executed as it is, it was clear the point of Ted moving on is him finally giving himself permission to move on from Tracy. After 17 years of growing beyond that wedding in 2013, Robin is much more open to love and actually admitted to having feelings for Ted. She was the one stuck in the past. Ted using the mistakes of the past to move forward is how he is going for Robin."
HIMYM,2zru92,jelatinman,1 point,Sun Mar 22 16:07:54 2015 UTC,"I don't believe in ""victim of timing"", quite frankly.  In my experience, love is love, and the single biggest problem is that Robin, for better or for worse, was never capable of giving it.  The single biggest issue with the character was that there was never a time where she gave love, freely.    Remember what we learned from Barney in season eight, when he got engaged to Robin?  A big part of Barney's plan was that he realized what Ted never did: Robin only wants things that she cannot have, to get Robin to want you, you have to make yourself unavailable.  I have known tons of girls with the same personality characteristic, its very real.  Its a neediness born of narcisism, people who want what they cannot have are not chasing love, they're chasing their own ego (they don't understand why everyone doesn't love them, so when someone doesn't, like Barney says ""it will drive Robin nuts"".)  Whenever I meet a girl like that, and their are plenty of them, I quietly excuse myself from the conversation.  Girls like that aren't worth relationships and they aren't worth getting to know, they're nothing but trouble.    How many relationships, with decent guys, did Robin ruin over the course of the show?  Whenever I hear people talk about Robin and Ted's timing, I want to reply that Robin is the Taylor Swift of HIMYM.  Taylor Swift has nothing but bad boyfriends, but what is the common denominator in all of Taylor Swift's relationships?  What is the likely problem?    25 years later, and Ted is still doing the same thing.  The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.  Remember when Robin stiffs Lily at the halloween party in Last Forever?  What the hell did Lily do?    If I saw that Robin had, at some point during the 25 years, grown up, I might be supportive of Ted trying again, but there's no evidence of that.  Ted, more than anyone, ought to know why it worked with Tracy and why it never did with Robin, Ted ought to be able to tell since he's been with both women.  Tracy is everything Robin wasn't: mature, grown-up, not narcisistic, and capable of loving outside of ego.  Maybe Robin grew up sometime between 2013 and 2030, but in my experience, people like Robin don't change, they just get older."

HIMYM,2zru92,RusVir,1 point,Tue Mar 24 07:52:27 2015 UTC,"It wasn't meant to be sexist, one of the reasons why people in TV shows use stereotypes for characters is because it reasonates so much.  Lily is a spendthift and a shoplifter.  Barney is into nothing but sleeping with every girl he can find, and then never calling them.  Ted?  Well, let's not go there, since Ted has tons of personality flaws too (He's pretentious, for one).  No one in HIMYM is perfect, because no one in real life is.  We all have personality flaws, I do, you do, everyone does.  Its not a man thing or a woman thing, its a people thing.  Men can be even more commitment-phobic then women are (part of the irony of HIMYM is the creators turned the commitment-phobe angle from a man to a woman), we're all like that.    The other thing to understand is that some people work well as friends.  People may be flawed, but we're still friend with them.  Its not that people don't have grating personality traits, because of course they do, its just that they don't bother us so much from our friends.  There's a lower threshold for friendship than there is for romantic relationship (at least, there is for me, I'll be friends with girls I don't want to date).  Ted and Robin clear the ""friends"" threshold, but not the romantic threshold.  Tracy and Ted clear the romantic threshold, because Tracy is wired differently than Robin is, not that she's a more ""perfect"" human being, just that she's different.  Tracy is more mature, for one thing, which can be a positive for many relationships, but a negative for others (it makes you less spontaneous, and there are people who like spontaneous)  Its not that Robin dated just nice guys, she didn't.  Don was kind of a dick, to be honest.  However, over the course of the show, we saw Robin duck out on relationships often enough that we know what the issue was.  Some people can't commit, and they can't make up their minds.  Robin had plenty of options in life.  Understand, narcisism doesn't just mean that you look at yourself in the mirror all day and think about how perfect you are, its subtler than that, but Robin clearly has it, just like all the characters have their own flaws.  I do not believe that the Robin we see over the course of the show's run was emotionally capable of ever being in a committed relationship, I just don't see it.  If she changed sometime between 2013 and 2030, it was never shown on the show."

It wasn't shown but she did change, it was subtly implied while Ted narrated the story. For example, Robin loves kids now, she spent a lot of time with Luke and Penny. This was actually the premise of the show all along, that in 2030 things are very different from how they were 20 years ago. Ted has changed too; he doesn't see Robin as ""the one"" anymore, he had gotten that with Tracy. He isn't after Robin again the same way as before, but the thing is that in 2030 life has put them back together, the situation is such that Ted can finally be with Robin even if he wasn't interested in her anymore.  And Robin did love Ted, she just wasn't ready for him during the span of the show. But she knew that some day she could, that's why she insisted on their ""single at 40"" pact."

So in-universe it makes sense as Ted doesn't need to tell his kids what they already know.   And the pact was revoked later on.   It was only revoked because Ted said it kept him from trying to move on. But anyway, the point is that they both did love each other enough to consider each other their backup spouses. And Robin still talked about it again in the deleted lunch scene."
HIMYM,2zru92,lestranger92,0,Wed Apr 1 19:11:08 2015 UTC,"Listen,i think you missed one point. You said that Ted,trying again with Robin,is coming back to the past. But,in 2030,Robin is his PRESENT,not his past. In 2030,his past is Tracy,while Robin is the present. And Tracy wanted Ted to be happy,so i think that,if she could,would give Ted the same advice that Penny and Luke gave to him. Because you have to consider we have two very different scenario:  -In 2013,Robin is Ted's past and Tracy is Ted's present and future,so he moves on and lives 10 beautiful years with his wife and his family.  -In 2030,Tracy is Ted's past and Robin is Ted's present. She is a full part of his life,she is always with him and his family (like Luke says) so Ted moves on and try to live his future with Robin,like Tracy would (and like Tracy DID,she moved on from his past love Max,and found happiness with Ted,so she knows this lesson very well). Both Ted and Robin grow up,and now they can be happy together (they were happy together also during season 2 anyway,the only obstacle between them was the different goals for their life,but now they had reached it). I know the ending was too rushed so they never explained this concept very well,but i think this is an important thing to consider thinking at the ending."

The whole show was about looking back at the lessons life experiences taught you. Almost every episode had a moral or lesson. That is how you move forward. You take a risk, make a mistake, learn from it, move forward. That is part of the reason the show was so good. Something was always learned. The finale tried to be clever, but it blew the whole ending. Ted needed to move forward, and that is exactly what Tracy represented. Why they killed her off we will never know. Tracy was the lesson. Be yourself and you find someone who actually likes you for being you."

That can be upsetting, obviously. But she was completely unwilling to admit that she was called that because of her own actions and how what she did affected not only Marshall, but Ted as well.  Racks up thousands of dollars in debt, doesn't tell Marshall about it, lets him think his student loans are the reason they can't get decent rates for a home, then when she's exposed she refuses to sell her clothes (i.e. the reason they're in debt in the first place) and then flips the blame on to Marshall, accusing him of being insensitive because he was being realistic in saying selling her paintings may not be the best thing to do.  Forces Marshall to take a job he hates at first to pay off her debts, and then berates him for ""changing"".  Constantly meddles in everyone's personal lives. (i.e. the ""Front Porch Test"", Robin and Barney, Ted and Robin)  Has a completely juvenile form of ""justice"" in which she steals things from people who are not behaving the way she wants them to behave.  Nearly tricks Ted into letting her leave for Spain without telling Marshall.  Throws a tantrum insisting they're going to Italy without giving Marshall a chance to speak.  Accuses Marshall of being more selfish and when he brings up completely legitimate concerns (Marshall and Marvin being a ""consolation prize"", San Francisco) she storms out. If Marshall had brought up San Francisco completely out of nowhere, it would have been uncalled for. But as a response to what she had said, it was a legitimate retort.    And these are just the things I can think of off the top of my head. The problem with Lily is that she is never held accountable. She does selfish things, and plays a victim constantly and then gets her way. Never truly understanding the consequences of her actions or taking responsibility."

HIMYM,2znymf,jelatinman,6,Fri Mar 20 15:20:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, I also really liked the 9th season for the Tracy-Ted parts, how sad they might be. But dedicating an entire season (you could even argue two) to a wedding and then ripping the marriage apart 15 minutes into the last episode without any prior indication just didn't feel right.   And, oh my gawd, was the final episode bad. It was atrocious. The whole episode felt rushed and just like they were trying to hard to give every character the perfect ending (except for Tracy of course).  The main reason though, why so many people (including me at first), didn't like the ending, was because the timing of Ted meeting Tracy the very first time and the viewer being informed about her death was absolutely horrendous.  I mean, the scene an entire series of 9 seasons and 208 episodes is leading up to, the scene the show is named after, one of the most beautiful and historic scenes in the history of television, being within 2 minutes of the viewer being told the most crushing and disheartening message of the entire show? ... I can't even describe how pissed I still am about that timing and the whole last episode.  Sorry for going somewhat off-topic, it seems like I still haven't gotten over the last episode. (and I re-watched HIMYM three times since I saw the ending the first time) Maybe that's because I just love the show so damn much.

I did hope a little bit that the reason ted was crying was because his mother didn't make it to his wedding, and since they were talking about what sort of mother misses her daughter's wedding, it was just a complicated way to call ted a girl one last time."
HIMYM,2znymf,ender89,3,Fri Mar 20 18:31:06 2015 UTC,"I wrote my own little analysis on this episode a little while back. It relates to what you're saying and I will copy it into this thread.  I watched this episode myself after watching an episode of Malcolm in the Middle called “health scare.” In the episode, Hal, the father in the family waits in agonizing suspense for results of some tests after doctors find a lump during his checkup.   It got me thinking about “Vesuvius” and what was going through the heads of our main character along with the titular Mother character.   There are two possibilities for the plot of the episode. The first is that Tracy, like Hal, was warned of a possible hazard during a checkup and she and Ted escaped to the inn to get their minds off of it. If this is the case, then their fears are of course confirmed later on when the results come back (unless you follow the plot of the alternate ending, in which case, it’s only the first part; there was a health scare but it was a false alarm.)  The second, and more likely possibility (due to the fact that Ted seems very sure of what’s going on) is that the mother’s illness is confirmed and the “old married couple” is there for the same reasons; to get their mind off of it.   The episode begins with a very slow, sad, and hauntingly beautiful piece (most likely composed just for the show) as we see the Farhampton inn during January or early February. We then fade in to see Ted and Tracy. Now, when the episodes were still airing, and it began with a flash forward to Ted and the Mother’s life together, I would always tell myself, “Oh! This is definitely going to be a good episode!” But something felt off this time. That would be established as the episode progressed.   Most of the episode takes place during the early day of the wedding. That isn’t what the episode is about though. The episode is Ted and Tracy and the sadness that has entered their lives. Ted tries to distract himself by telling his wife (and us) the story of the broken lamp in order to lighten the mood and I realize now that that’s what the writers were doing for US. After all, did anyone else notice that this episode isn’t told to the kids? Bob Saget doesn’t narrate this episode; Josh Radnor does.  I’m getting ahead of myself though.   Throughout “Vesuvius” we see Ted and the Mother in the dinner hall and watch as reality slowly hits Ted. It begins with them both laughing and smiling and celebrating that they’ve become an old married couple (….ouch. Guess we know why they’re celebrating now. However, that’s been said before.)   We skip ahead to the second time the story has been interrupted (the first time being by Curtis the help desk clerk, but that’s not important outside of comedic reasons) when Tracy remembers and reveals that she knows this story on top of Ted’s other stories. But did she actually “remember”? I think that Tracy knew all along about this story but allowed her husband to continue so that he could escape reality for a little longer. But then she realizes that that’s a mistake. She can’t allow the love of her life to do this to himself; she can’t let him live in a fantasy world where problems aren’t real until the very last second. And she wants to discuss what it means for them, as much as it pains her to do so.   She tells him that he is indeed the love of her life. But she worries about him. She doesn’t want him to live in his stories. “Life only moves forward,” she says. Alright. Something is definitely up at this point. If it wasn’t clear to the audience before now, hopefully they can see that this isn’t just a fun little flash-forward. When I first viewed this episode (on the air date), that realization came to me right away but I told myself I was being paranoid. This was a comedy after all. The dead Mother theories were ridiculous and always had been.   Before we move on to the next part, let’s relook at what Tracy says to Ted again; “[Don’t] live in [your] stories. Life only moves forward.”   And there it is; the reason for this series! Ted telling Luke and Penny the story of how he met their mother wasn’t just about asking permission to date Robin. It was his way of honoring what Tracy wanted. He told his kids the entire story so that he could live in them one last time; relive all of his great memories and then finally, after six years of grief, fulfill Tracy’s wishes and move forward in life.   Time to move on. We take a look at the second to last flash-forward. In present time, Ted has just established that everyone knows he’s moving to Chicago and Robin says the painful truth; they don’t know the next time they’d all be together. “And then I think it hit all of us,” 2024 Ted says, “We DIDN’T know the next time we’d all be together. And it’s funny, in a moment like that when what’s really happening is too intense to deal with sometimes its best-” and he breaks off, looking at his beloved wife, who gives him a reassuring smile and finishes his sentence; “…to leave it unspoken and just enjoy each other’s company instead.”   That’s when Tracy realizes that maybe forgetting about the current situation for now isn’t such a bad idea. It’s too late though. Reality finally has a firm grip on Ted and is ready to strike. The look he gives his love says it all; this is real. Running won’t solve anything.   Still, he manages to get through the rest of his story, concluding with Robin’s mother making it to the wedding after all which of course serves as a lead to what has become Tracy’s most infamous quote; “What mother is going to miss her daughter's wedding?”   And reality hits… and it hits hard. Ted begins to break down at his wife’s words. She tries to correct her error by teasingly telling him he’s being ridiculous but tears fill her own eyes because she knows it’s true. She’s never going to see her children grow up. She won’t ever become a TRUE old married couple with Ted.   Alas, she manages to distract her husband with another story from his past and send them back to the first step; the step we saw them at during the beginning of the episode. Who knows how long it worked before they inevitably arrived back at the final step?   As the episode concludes, the camera pans out to reveal the cold and lonely night as “If you see her, say hello” plays gently in the background.   It’s worth mentioning that one of the lyrics to the song is, “She left here last early spring.” I can almost guarantee that this wasn’t put in there by accident. It was the writers’ way of revealing that Tracy only lived for about another two months after the scenes we were shown.   It was a sickness that killed her and by the looks of it, they caught it too late. It’s why, when we see her in the hospital bed at the end of “Last Forever,” that she shows no signs of having been through chemo therapy. The illness was at a stage where simply “enjoy[ing] each other’s company” for as long as possible was all that they could do."

I kept thinking (before I got that this was foreshadowing) that it was about her wedding, and her mom didn't show up or something, but that didn't make sense. She's not going to be there for Penny's wedding. This is why I like the alternate ending. The fact that Ted waits so long, only to get her for a decade, just sucks. But this episode is really well done. When she says she doesn't want him to be the guy who lives in his stories... I really like what you said about how him retelling the WHOLE story to his kids is him reliving his stories one last time before finally moving forward. This whole show is so well thought-out.  Also, about the alternate ending, I like to think that Barney and Robin got back together. Otherwise, Robin gets a really crappy ending. They sort of hinted at this during the montage where Ted's giving his life speech and they show his and Tracy's wedding. There's a shot of Barney smiling and Ted says, ""Stuff gets broken."" Then there's a shot of Robin, smiling back at Barney and Ted says, ""Stuff gets put back together."" Anyway, that's my spiel."

Upon first watching I didn't pick up on this. The final season was terrible at times, but in saying that, it was very powerful. I only hated parts of it because I cared so much.  I think that my hatred for Tracy dying was that we all knew that Robin would end up with Ted... I dislike Robin, pretty much always did. The whole series I empathised with Ted and wanted him to find a nice lady, and then when he does, it is torn away in the end and he ends up with good old second best Robin who I'd never, ever see myself with. So in that way, it angered me.  The entire show was one big mix for me. Many of my friends would comment on how great Marshall and Lily are, but I never forgave her for the San Francisco antics."
HIMYM,2znymf,mini381,1 point,Sat Mar 21 11:39:27 2015 UTC,My hubby is finally watching season 9. We just finished this episode and he asked me why Ted started crying. I had to play dumb since he has somehow managed to make it this far without knowing the end. By binge watching this season with him I'm actually seeing how well done it actually was (although I still hate a full season being dedicated to one wrekend)

Wiki has it here   Throughout the episode, numbers appear on ordinary objects counting down from 50 to 1. This is a countdown from the beginning of the episode to the eventual bad news, which is told right after the ""1"" is shown. As the final scene of the episode closes, a parking meter is in the background displaying a red 'expired' state. The countdown was an idea taken from the 1988 film Drowning by Numbers; through the course of that film, the numbers 1 to 100 appear in order, sometimes seen in the background, and sometimes spoken by the film's characters.[3] According to Bays, the countdown was used to give an early signal to the audience that something big was about to happen at the end of the episode.[2]   also, cute trivia   In the countdown from 50 down to 1, the number 33 is seen in a screen at Robin's new job, within the sentence ""33 miners rescued from collapsed mine"".

I'm glad the side plot happened, because as sad as Marshall's dad's death was, his grief was becoming a little tired and was consuming his character entirely.  Robin did not know what The North Pole was despite living in Canada for much of her life, and being a journalist.

HIMYM,2z89oj,Purpurix,8,Mon Mar 16 13:23:38 2015 UTC,"If you actually paid any attention to the show at all   Sigh, okay.   the fact that the majority of Ted's story focused on Robin and not the mother? Ted even mentioned Robin a lot more than he mentioned the mother.   And he mentioned Barney a lot too. Is he in love with Barney? Or maybe the reason he talks so much about them is because he met the mother at Barney and Robin's wedding. Also, he didn't talk only about Robin, he mentioned a lot of his ex girlfriends.    Do you not remember the crayon drawings that Ted's kids drew of them and ""Aunt Robin"" taking them to the beach and the zoo, which were revealed in the season 3 episode, 'Little Boys'? Now, do you really think that would've happened had the mother would've still been alive? How many women would be okay with their husband's ex-girlfriend being that close to their children and spending that much time with them?    Tracy was the one who asked Robin to be at her wedding, even though one of Ted's stories is about never inviting your ex to the wedding. I guess she doesn't mind Ted hanging out with Robin, he has let her go.    Why do you think Robin is spending all this time with Ted and his kids in the future?   What would a single person who travels a lot do? Visit friends and their families. It doesn't seem she advanced much on the love department after divorcing Barney.    Or how about the season 7 episode, 'No Pressure,' which established the bet that Marshall and Lily made on whether or not Ted and Robin would end up together? After Robin moves out of Ted's apartment at the end of the episode, Lily once again asks Marshall to pay up, as she has so many times before. And like he's done so many times before, Marshall just looks away, smiles coyly and says, ""not yet,"" as the screen fades to black. Are you telling me that you're unable to notice a clear case of foreshadowing? The writers were practically screaming that Ted and Robin were by no means over.   Except Marshall pays up after Ted's wedding. Watch the finale again.    Then there was Ted and Robin's 40 year pact, that they'd end up together when they were both in their 40's   And Ted breaks the pact because Robin doesn't love him. Plus she also made a pact with Barney, so what?    Ted's 45 Days speech to the mother in the season 8 episode, and 'The Time Travelers,' which clearly foreshadowed the mother's death long before the season 9 episode 'Vesuvius' left no doubt.    If you remember the 45 days speech, this was Ted's darkest hour. He was all alone while his best friends were happy and starting a family or getting married. I'm sure that meeting her 45 days early would have been good for him, no matter what.    And let's not forget Robin's locket and her ""sign from the universe"" moment with Ted in Central Park   This was retconned on the last season. Barney also went to Central Park. If Ted hadn't gone, she would have met Barney. This isn't a sign that Ted and Robin are meant for each other, it's a sign that he couldn't move on. But he did move on later (the whole scene where Robin flies away).   or the fact that it was revealed in the very next episode(the season 8 finale) that Lily found Robin drunk and depressed at MacLaren's shortly before Ted's wedding to Stella, where Robin asked Lily, ""why isn't Ted marrying me?"" Does that sound like a woman who isn't in love with Ted? And isn't it odd to have both of those episodes right before Robin's wedding to Barney? Seriously, this isn't rocket science.   Well, you have one episode where Robin says that he doesn't love him. I don't think rocket science ignores information that conflicts with the narrative.    One thing that Ted and Robin repeated to each other at several points during the show is, ""if you've got chemistry, you only need one thing - timing.""    Which is exactly what happened with Barney and Robin too! But let's ignore that because reasons.    Ted had his family and gave up his childish notion of ""the one,"" and Robin had done everything she wanted to do with her career and had settled down into a quiet life spending all her time with Ted and his kids after Tracy's death - something she wasn't willing to do when she was with Barney.   Yeah, but then again she married Barney, something she wasn't willing to do with Ted. But she chose love over work when she was with  Don, something she wasn't willing to do with Barney. It's safe to say not even Robin knows what she wants.    Ted and Robin were actually great for each other because they brought out the best in each other.   Are you sure about that? Wasn't he about to cheat on Victoria because of her? Didn't he asked her to give up her dogs after a fight? Didn't he become friends with benefits with her for a while?    And they were never happier than when they were with each other. Ted and the mother were a couple that was thrown together at the last minute with no relationship development at all; they barely had 20 minutes of screen time together in the entire season.    Screen time =/= relationship time. How do you know he was happier with Robin than with Tracy?    As for Robin and Barney, the writers spent the better part of seasons 8 and 9 showing just how dysfunctional and wrong for each other they were, and how Robin's doubts about whether she was marrying the right man kept growing right up to her wedding. Barney's immature antics kept angering Robin with each day they got closer to the wedding. Robin spent the morning of her wedding walking barefoot on the beach with Ted, and not too concerned about searching for her missing, inebriated fiancé.    But they also spent the better part of those reasons seeing how to fix those problems and how  Ted lets Robin go.    And when Robin was ready to run off with Ted just minutes before her wedding to Barney, can anyone truthfully say they were surprised when the marriage didn't work out?   Well, Lily also ran away from her engagement. Plus Robin wants what she can't have (the lobster theory), so I'm not surprised she suddenly wants the best man (Ted) on her wedding day.    So, there were those of you who didn't like the fact that the writers used trickery, misdirection, and twist endings in their story?    Wasn't your whole argument that the ending was obvious from the start?    getting the audience to think a story is going one direction, only to reveal that it was something completely different all along.    So you are saying the finale was the completely different direction the series has been going? You can't use contradicting arguments to make a point."
HIMYM,2z89oj,henrykazuka,8,Mon Mar 16 21:05:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with much of what was said, but the thing that bothered me most (besides how much they crammed into the finale) was the Barney & Robin marriage and divorce, it was entirely unnecessary.   My final season would have had Barney getting back together with Nora (and ultimately having a kid), then at their wedding, Robin would be the one who introduces Tracy to Ted, saying she'd be perfect for him. All the rest of the group could still have interactions with Tracy, much as they did, but only Robin would be the one who immediately recognises how perfect she is for Ted.  Having now realised that she has introduced both Barney and Ted to their futures wives and with Marshall & Lily having kids, Robin feels like an outsider to the group, so she goes off travelling the world, living the life she always wanted to, while Ted is living the life he wanted. As it went originally, Tracy dies (but with much more screen time for their relationship and the mourning period etc), but then one day Ted hears from Lily that Robin is finally moving back to New York, so he sits down to tell the kids the story of how it was Aunt Robin that introduced him to their mother..."

In fact i think the plot of the finale is very good,it's okay to end the series with Ted and Robin together,it's okay for Barney and Robin to divorce and him having a daughter. But,i think execution was too rushed,and this influenced the perception of a lot of viewers. Like i said in another topic,we didn't even know yet if the mother was officially dead,that the kids were already talking about aunt Robin. Why all that briskness? That scene should have been a little more calm. Also,i agree that during the show we had hints that Barney and Robin were not right together,but at the same time we had so many hints that they were ""meant to be"" (i think at episodes like ""Ring Up"" or ""The Reharsal Dinner"" or ""Platonish"") i think this happened because the other writers of the staff didn't know about the ending until the very end (only Bays and Thomas knew) so maybe the other writers thought that Barney and Robin were meant to be so they wrote them in that way. But still,this compromise a little those episodes,hindsight. Anyway i agree with a lot of things this user said,he/she surely knows the series very well."
HIMYM,2z89oj,Domyfranky,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:00:32 2015 UTC,"I agree - had the finale not been as rushed, and the timing of the story plotlines told a bit more carefully at the end, I would have bought in to everything."
HIMYM,2z89oj,Ericws,23,Thu Mar 19 16:20:36 2015 UTC,"I stopped reading at ""You were plainly unable to understand the story"". What an asinine thing to say to anybody.   People understood it. It might even have been alright if it weren't atrociously executed.  EDIT: I'm not done. Frankly, you don't see those of us who disliked it running around, telling the fans who did that they don't understand storytelling, or screenwriting. I'm HAPPY for you guys. You guys didn't have to watch something you loved become something you hated, and I would never try to take that away from you.   But if a television show's ending blows up in its own face, then the writers were not in-tune with their audience. How dare anybody blame the audience for something like this. It's not our responsibility to like a story, it's their responsibility to tell it, and that entails feeling out your audience, paying big changes their dues when you write them, and making sure nothing comes out of no-where for people.   If your audience hates a character that you need them to love, then you are responsible for figuring that out. It's just petty and teenage to lash out at someone with ""I'm perfect, you just don't GET me!!!"""
HIMYM,2z89oj,captainpotty,3,Mon Mar 16 14:23:25 2015 UTC,I never had a problem with the idea of Robin hanging out with the kids or Ted knowing a lot about her because I'm not so insecure in my relationships that I can't let my partner hand out with his best friend.

HIMYM,2z89oj,MissRepresentation,2,Mon Mar 16 16:11:22 2015 UTC,"The ending was strange for me; I liked it, but felt like certain things didn't add up. I'd been watching over the course of several years, but the last two seasons were a binge. That made me feel like the ending ultimately had the wrong conclusion.  Then I went back and watched the whole series again. It's painfully obvious that the show is about Robin the entire time. Watching it a second time made me catch all of the little hints and all of the foreshadowing. If you are paying attention and can catch the foreshadowing (some is less obvious than others), then I think the ending was clear. If you watch it (like I did) over the course of years and have the chance to forget much of the small details, you get distracted by the dangled carrot that is the occasional tease about the mother. Then you get to the end, see how wonderful she is, then get upset about the ending because it feels like a betrayal of the story."
HIMYM,2z89oj,xDragod,3,Mon Mar 16 15:11:41 2015 UTC,"This exactly. If you watched it over the years, and not in one binge-marathon, it sort of upsets you how they treated the ending. I wanted to know more about Tracy when it came down to it, and wanted to see how things panned out for the two of them. However, we were given only the 20 or so minutes, in total, of the final episodes.   After rewatching the series within a few weeks, I do see the subtle hints and foreshadowing for how the ending turned out, and I respect that. It just felt, to me, as though Tracy's whole presence was undermined and was only used to satisfy Ted's desire for a family, then to move on to Robin.  The Youtube commentor brought up some great points of character development, some I didn't even think about, that I found spot on. That is what I took from the post."
HIMYM,2z89oj,Candman91,2,Mon Mar 16 17:01:25 2015 UTC,Wow. That completely just changed my attitude towards the finale and the end of the show in general. Thank you kind stranger
HIMYM,2z89oj,jgchi12,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:47:17 2015 UTC,"The point of the story is that Ted and Robin's timing wasn't right when they first met because even though they were perfect for each other, they were at different places in their lives and wanted different things. Ted wanted to meet ""the one"" and have a family, and Robin wanted to travel the world and pursue her career. But over the course of nine seasons as their characters grew and changed, they both reached a point where they did want the same things and were ready to be together. Ted had his family and gave up his childish notion of ""the one,"" and Robin had done everything she wanted to do with her career and had settled down into a quiet life spending all her time with Ted and his kids after Tracy's death - something she wasn't willing to do when she was with Barney.   I keep saying this and nobody believes me. Thanks for gathering up all this extra evidence, I think I'll be able to link to this to support my claim that the ending was actually good."
HIMYM,2z89oj,Farren246,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:38:33 2015 UTC,"I really do agree with the points from the above comment (it in fact sums up why I loved the finale, and was hugely surprised when I read the reviews the next day).   However, the previous comment also seemed correct to me - the set up of Robin and Barney did take too long, for something to end abruptly between 2 scenes in the finale - I think a far more logical ending would have been for the wedding to have been called off (and one I'm not sure that the writers weren't initially planning for), but they realised that it would cast both Robin and Barney in fairly unlikable (yet understandable) lights, which would be hard to recover from with only 40 minutes of screentime left, so they reversed the decision.  As much as I do enjoy shippers on TV programmes, I really do think its a mistake when writers change their plans because of it, and can potentially ruin characters in a far worse way than their original writing decisions do. Just look at Arrow for example, the character of Felicity Smoak was originally just going to be there for one episode, but as she was a great character, they introduced her full time (a good reaction to fan decisions). However, after a while, the fans shipping her and Oliver (the main character) became quite vocal, and made her a love interest. Her character became bland, and nearly unecessary to the show. The writers then reversed their decision, and immediately her character went back to being the one it was before.  Tl;dr - both comments have points, but it feels like a last minute change may have been made by the showrunners, which made the finale worse, due to fears of upsetting fans"

Last episode, and since you said that you have seen it all from the beginning to the end, I feel disappointed that you not even noticed that Marshall actually pays Lilly, in Maclaren's at Ted wedding.  Another point you have focus on, that Robin get to spend a lot of time with the kids. There I think is because Tracy and Robin is good friends. At Ted and Stellas wedding, there is a sentence which is repeated some times: ""no exes at a wedding""  Robin still comes to Teds wedding, and that is only because Tracy talked her into it, Ted also says that in the last episode.

HIMYM,2z4deb,Domyfranky,22,Sun Mar 15 13:30:19 2015 UTC,"The only thing i disagree with it's about Barney spending the entire series as a playboy. I think it would have been cool introducing earlier a new character like Quinn and develop a good will they/won't they between Barney and her. Also,Barney/Robin could have happenend anyway,but it should have stayed only a casual thing in season 3 and at the height in season 5,and then it should have been finished for good."
HIMYM,2z4deb,vedderer,3,Sun Mar 15 13:33:59 2015 UTC,Part of Barney's place in the story is how he contrasts with Ted.  This wouldn't have been as clear had Barney developed a true love interest earlier on in the series.
HIMYM,2z4deb,RusVir,2,Mon Mar 16 02:02:19 2015 UTC,"I agree. For me Barney and Robin's relationship felt forced sometimes. They could have made their initial relationship in season 5 a few episodes longer, showing how they got together because of their similarities but it didn't work out, and that have been the end of it. I didn't like that they still had unresolved feelings for each other after that and became on-off. But I know this wasn't their original plan for the show and they did it because of ratings."
HIMYM,2z4deb,GallbladderGone,11,Mon Mar 16 21:30:05 2015 UTC,"yep, this pretty much nails everything on the head of why i felt the finale sucked. good read thanks for highlighting this."
HIMYM,2z4deb,takimoto23x,8,Sun Mar 15 18:02:06 2015 UTC,"Agree fully with this.  I also think the story arc could have worked if they hadn't have rushed from Ted and Tracy's wedding, to her death, to the kids telling him to go after Robin in like 45 seconds. I needed more of Ted and Tracy fighting for time, and a whole lot more of Ted, alone, for years, being a good dad to his kids but still missing something. I needed maybe four episodes of Barney and Robin's wedding, and then the rest of the season could have been spent doing what they crammed into the last ten minutes of the last episode."
HIMYM,2z4deb,vedderer,0,Sun Mar 15 20:05:10 2015 UTC,"Its ""How I Met Your Mother"", not ""Stuff That Happened After I Met Your Mother""."
HIMYM,2z4deb,MissRepresentation,3,Mon Mar 16 12:31:21 2015 UTC,"I definitely disagree with pretty much all of this.    The entire show would have been predictable and boring if Robin and Ted had played the ""will they or will they won't"" game during the entire series. I appreciated the fact that you find out that Robin is not the mother in episode 1. That's what made the finale so much more surprising to me. I disagree that Robin and Barney's relationship was more developed than Robin and Ted's. Ted's feelings towards Robin were focused on in nearly every single season, not just the two that they were together.  I disagree with this because I thought it was interesting to see that in the end, no woman could truly tame Barney and turn him into a good husband. If even Robin couldn't do it, then no woman will. Only him having a child could truly get him to settle down.  I disagree that the entire audience should all want one ending. Even after endearing Tracy to the audience, I was still sad that Ted never ended up with Robin (until the finale). Choosing not to show her would be a huge cop-out.    The only thing I agree with was how Barney and Robin's divorce was handled and how more than 5 minutes and a cop out excuse was shown. Other than that, I disagree with pretty much everything the poster said. Even at the end where they mention that Robin would never choose her career over Barney because she chose Don over her career - well, look at what happened the first time she chose her job over her partner. It didn't end well for her, so why would she want to do it again?"
HIMYM,2z4deb,vedderer,3,Mon Mar 16 13:01:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed with the fact about Robin and Don. That was a very important step,and of course no one can blame Robin if she chose her career."
HIMYM,2z4deb,gamedemon24,3,Mon Mar 16 14:19:57 2015 UTC,That's a great point about Don and Robin.  Just another great example about how we all come by our strengths and weaknesses honestly.

HIMYM,2z4deb,Akintudne,7,Sun Mar 15 17:07:51 2015 UTC,"I know that I'm going to get downvoted for this, but here we go.  First off, the argument that something ""doesn't make sense"" is never a good one.  In art, the piece of art only needs to make sense in the artists mind.  The argument holds even less water in other areas.  For example, I couldn't go to the mathematics department at my university and criticize an equation simply because it didn't make sense.  Bob Dylan said it best: ""Don't criticize what you can't understand.""  If it doesn't make sense (to you), then you should try to figure things out before you criticize them.  Second, read this thread explaining how HIMYM is a retelling of Love in the Time of Cholera, Ted and Tracy's favorite book: http://www.reddit.com/r/HIMYM/comments/21bfrw/doppelg%C3%A4ngers_from_cholera/  Third, had they only shown the Mother as a quick meeting at the train station, the audience would have no idea how and why she differed from all of the other women that Ted dated.  It's my opinion that having Tracy meet everyone else first gave the audience a sense as to why she was different, why Ted went about their relationship differently, and why she ultimately was the love of his life.  You might remember an episode in season 1 called ""Game Night.""  This episode was supremely important in telling the story of how Barney became the person that we was.  On one hand, you've got Ted, who is stubborn in finding love.  On the other hand, you've got Barney, who gave up on love and settled for banging chicks all the time.  That makes 1) Barney a good comparison to Ted and 2) his story about him going back to trying for love again.  I disagree that Barney and Robin showed more growth than Ted and Robin.  Their relationships were completely different and almost can't be compared.  Barney and Robin made sense in many ways and Ted and Robin made sense in many ways.  Ted's relationships with Robin is a good contrast to his relationship with Tracy (and not just because of the rain and color schemes).  With Robin, Ted had to force things to work.  With Tracy, Ted (and Lilly for that matter) treated things differently.  Ultimately, the story is about a person whose biggest weakness is also his biggest strength.  The things about Ted that made him a lousy person to date were the same things that made him really good at loving that specific person for that (or any) amount of time.  That's my take, at least.  Edit: grammar"
HIMYM,2z4deb,vedderer,2,Mon Mar 16 01:20:11 2015 UTC,"In art, the piece of art only needs to make sense in the artists mind. The argument holds even less water in other areas. For example, I couldn't go to the mathematics department at my university and criticize an equation simply because it didn't make sense.   I can agree with everything you said except this. The argument only holds up if the artist's intention is to keep the piece locked in their basement. If they want it to be successful, accepted, and marketable, then it has to make sense to an audience. Plus, few people enjoy asking what a piece is about and getting an eyeroll accompanied by a pretentious ""I guess you just don't get it,"" as if the failing is entirely in them rather than in any way a failure on the artist's part to effectively communicate their vision.  Using your math dept analogy, it's true that I can't walk in off the street and criticize an equation. But if I've spent my college career majoring in math and the professor of my final 4000 level course puts some incomprehensible formula on the board that stumps half the class and expects us to just ""get it,"" that's not the students' fault but the professor's."
HIMYM,2z4deb,RusVir,1 point,Mon Mar 16 12:57:40 2015 UTC,"My response was not a ""pretentious 'I guess you just don't get it'"".  The original post admitted that he/she didn't get it when they said it ""didn't make sense.""  If something doesn't make sense, it could be because it wasn't presented in a digestible way or that the audience was missing something.  To criticize a piece of work because ""it didn't make sense"" assumes that it was the artists fault.  Plus, this isn't complex mathematics we're talking about here.  It's a sitcom!  I wouldn't want for them to have presented the story in any other way.  Just like I wouldn't want Aphex Twin to start making pop music.  I don't get Wes Anderson movies and don't enjoy them.  I would never claim that they didn't make any sense, though.  I just assume that there is something that I'm missing."
HIMYM,2z4deb,vedderer,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:10:46 2015 UTC,"The thing about the art of the finale is that it doesn't matter if it didn't fully make sense to the viewers, because they are not the direct audience of the story. The direct audience is Ted's kids, and they get the story because they know a lot more about what happened in the future. That is why they jump to the conclusion and tell him to go after Robin."
HIMYM,2z4deb,vedderer,1 point,Mon Mar 16 21:50:26 2015 UTC,"I think we didn't need to know Tracy at any cost. Tracy was important for what she represent for Ted,not as a character herself.

You can't put Barney and Robin at the center of the story for 3 seasons,and then say ""they got divorced but it's not a big deal,let's talk immediately of something else"" i agreed with the divorce,but they had to face this situation more time. Same thing with Tracy's death. Has she to die? ok,but we as viewers need a little more time to deal with that. Instead,we didn't even had the official confirm yet of her death that already the kids were talking about Robin. So,it needed to be a little more calm and less rushed."
HIMYM,2z4deb,AverNL,1 point,Mon Mar 16 08:41:56 2015 UTC,The story is How I Met Your Mother.  The things that happened afterwards weren't the focus.  That's why he didn't speak much of Barney and Robin's divorce. It's also why we don't see him mourn after Tracy's death.

Once you get that, mix with water and yeast (I only know industrial portions), let rise two hours covered in plastic wrap in an oiled container.   Punch down dough, turn out and roll to roughly 3/4 inch thickness. Use a pizza slicer to cut a rope about a yard long and 3/4 inch wide.   Roll into a uniform cylinder. Grab each end in one hand, and bring hands together, twisting so each hand returns to starting side.   Grab the ends, roll under the ends so it forms a loop around the bottom of the pretzel. Dip in baking soda solution (it was like a 1/4 cup to a couple gallons - don't remember, I was 16). Set an inch apart on trays, cook at 400 Fahrenheit.   When beginning to brown (4 minutes?  5?) nudge each pretzel apart and rotate the tray 180 degrees. Cook four or five minutes more, so pretzels are golden brown but not charred. Immediately dip in melted butter. Let cool, eat."

The image someone posted below are all TV tropes and clichés that are not only found in both sitcoms but countless others. So could you be more specific?"

I suppose it's all borrowing from other places?"
HIMYM,2z0mnf,catsandblankets,6,Sat Mar 14 16:11:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly, they're similar in some ways (adult friends who live in New York in large apartments) but they're different entities who take their own paths. And even like you said, the little things that did happen the same weren't invented by friends. I think the viewer maybe just goes into it like ""this is gonna be just like friends"" and then when something down the road happens it's ""yep told you, that one thing also happened once in friends""  What really grinds my gears is when people use terms like ""blatant ripoff"" and ""completely exactly plagiarized"". Like okay, that's a little heavy."
HIMYM,2z0mnf,Zaiya53,1 point,Sat Mar 14 16:45:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is annoying. But I don't think that people mean to do it, they just don't understand that it happens more than they realize. So if you've only ever seen friends & himym, I could see how you'd fall into thinking that way.   I think it hit me the hardest when I was watching the episode of Buffy where she was in the psych ward. I was fascinated by the concept. Then, Supernatural did it & I was like ""hey.... Hold on a minute......"" Then more & more shows I watched had an episode like that & I found out Buffy wasn't even the first one. I can list like ten of em off the top of my head. My world shattered a bit but now I more so look at it as borrowing ideas vs stealing them.   So, I mean, I understand because it happened to me, just was never explained to me that way."

HIMYM,2z0mnf,ezrubie7,2,Mon Mar 16 02:02:48 2015 UTC,"Aside from the basics (5-6 friends living in NYC who hang out together, and some of the group dynamics for dating) how are they really similar? All the story arcs are pretty different, and Friends in general is a much ""lighter"" show imo.   I think initially it comes across the same (hanging around a coffee house vs bar) but the context/growth is pretty different imo."
HIMYM,2z0mnf,aversion25,11,Sat Mar 14 16:18:31 2015 UTC,"Okay so I'll just name a few things since I'm on my phone, but I wanna preface this by saying I am a HIMYM fan first and foremost I prefer it over Friends and I am in no way bashing HIMYM.   Firstly you have Ross and Ted. Two nerdy guys who have weird passions (Ross likes dinosaurs Ted likes architecture). They both fall for a girl in the first episode (Rachel and Robin) and the whole series is a will they won't they, with the couples dating for a year and then breaking up only to ultimately end up together at the end. They both become professors who then go on to date students.   The relationships between the two main couples eventually gets strained when the womanizers of the group (Barney and Joey) develop feelings for the main women. (Rachel and Robin) but in the end it does not work out obviously.   Rachel and Robin are two women who are ultimately career driven and strive to be taken seriously and it causes problems in their relationships. Rachel and Ross break up for the first time because Ross can't handle Rachel working so much, and Robin constantly puts her work ahead of everything else in their life.   Marshall and Chandler are similar in that they are both goofy lovable oafs who are bad with women but still end up with the loves of their lives and they are constantly making jokes and being witty. (A cliche in many sitcoms as one of you mentioned but it needs to be said anyway)  Lily and Monica are both extremely controlling and are both really into cooking. Not that much with those two admittedly.  I lose my train of thought trying to type this all and have it make sense so I'm just gonna rattle some off nonsensically please forgive me    Both Marshall and Chandler can't take a good picture, Marshall and Lily, Chandler and Monica struggle to have kids at first. Joey and Barney become ordained ministers and officiate their best friend's marriages. That chick gets dumped on her birthday in both shows. Ted and Ross buy cars and end up getting rid of them. Barney and Phoebe have long lost dad's. Rachel and Robin are really good at getting out of tickets while Barney and Ross are not. The characters try to make a habit out of going to the gym.   Admittedly there are a lot of sitcom cliches and whatnot, and if I were watching Friends again I would be able to rattle off some more but off the top of my head that's all I got."
HIMYM,2z0mnf,idwthis,2,Sat Mar 14 17:40:39 2015 UTC,"Oh there's an article floating around that mentions a lot of the stuff you said - and I definitely agree there are similarities. I just feel that a lot of it boils down to sitcom cliches as opposed to being a rip off. Both shows ran for slightly too long, and the characters boiled into parodies of themselves to some extent. So once these characters are developed there's not many options for them to go. We either get 1-off episodes that aren't referenced again or go in circles (person loses job, gets new job, person A goes back to person B for a while, etc).  The context is so radically different between the shows probably to make up for the fact that they have similar dynamics. Like Ross is a guy who married young and is proud of his PHD + accomplishments, whereas Ted played the field and was more average. Both have passion in their field (which isn't unique or nerdy - Chandler/Marshall got mocked when they talked about work stuff too).   Ross is reuniting with someone he's had a crush on for years, so his first love. Ted is trying to chase the one and get a fairy tale ending. Ted winds up with Robin as an afterthought when hes a widow, whereas Ross/Rachel had a baby together and clear feelings throughout the show. Even that initial breakup is totally different - jealousy + sex with another woman, as opposed to a semi amiable breakup b/c they were two people who wanted different things.   Another thing that falls into the category is Ross/Ted both start off as teachers in the relationship as well - Ross teaches Rachel how to survive on her own (like do laundry, etc) and Ted teaches Robin how to be in her first serious relationship.  Marshall makes puns and is very lovable, but hes nowhere near as cynical or sarcastic as Chandler. They both had polar opposite upbringings and dilemmas. It's totally opposite sides of the spectrum in terms of humor. And Chandler can flirt, whereas Marshall (and Ross) can't.   Eh Lily baked and made Thanksgiving dinners, but that was just bc they needed someone to get the gang together for holiday dinners and stuff. It's not something unique to her character, whereas Monica is literally a chef. She got really disciplined after losing weight and became super organized, and is super competitive (something Lily always thought was immature).  Also Friends was much more on point with recurring characters/guest stars. HIMYM was smaller and a more self contained universe.  Basically I feel like sit coms are very formulaic, and they're the same show b/c the base elements dont change much. You have the funny guy, the party guy, nerdy guy, or unique guy. You have the career girl, or quirky girl, or super nice girl. Once you pick out careers/situations you can only do so much to keep things realistic yet different.  Overall I think Friends was much lighter show than HIMYM (I liked both) and that tone/underlying themes keep the two apart. Think about the breakups in Friends - most were comical. Guy was too young, or guy was too friendly with his sister, or guy shot a bird, girl is too immature, girl is annoying. We had very few serious breakups/losses (maybe Richard, David, actor girl who moved with Joey, Kathy for Chandler etc). Didn't really touch upon death/grieving. Phoebe met her dad, but that wasn't explored. Ross had 3 divorces and 2 illegitimate children and that was hilarious (we never once saw him depressed about it).   Whereas HIMYM dove into it with death, grieving, loss, hard break ups, etc. I mean they ended with the main character being a widow. They always tried to be much more bittersweet when it came to their scenarios which allowed their show to resonate more with viewers.  Sorry I definitely rambled on for way too long. Friends was a hit not because it was the first sit com but because they had a great cast + used the building blocks in a refreshing way. Same with HIMYM."
HIMYM,2z0mnf,ezrubie7,1 point,Sun Mar 15 01:06:39 2015 UTC,"You forgot that Lily and Monica are both meddlers! Monica called up Mike to get him to get Phoebe back otherwise Pheebs would end up marrying David, and Lily was a master at breaking Ted up with his girlfriends.   And also, there was Carl and Gunther. Both the manager/owner(respectively) of the hang out spots, who knows the gang, and is invited to parties or helps look out for them when they're drunk, whatever. And they did the same joke of having Carl ask Marshal what his last name was as they did with Gunther, when he asked Joey what his last name was."

HIMYM,2ywvg1,jelatinman,6,Fri Mar 13 14:31:58 2015 UTC,"I appreciated all of the Predator references, as it shows how weird romantic traditions can come about. TV writers need to know that real people are not too cookie cutter or too quirky. First appearance of Nora! She is played by Iranian-American actress Nazanin Boniadi. She was born in Tehran, raised in London as a little girl, moved to the United states, and was originally pursuing a career in biological sciences at University of California, Irvine (the one with the flag controversy). She decided to pursue acting in 2006.  Marshall's man cave is a '90s paradise. And his mom gets him the godawful Sunny D? Hopefully it fuels their Dr. Mario runs.  Even Marcus is out of the house now. Robin must have taken her idea of a single ladies club from Parks and Recreation's ""Galentine's Day (2010)."" Why there are 2 Galentine's Day titled episodes is a mystery.  An overnight bag Ted? Seriously? You gotta find a classier way to bone the recently divorced woman trying to ruin your career! Nice touch to include Bill Fagerbakke in this episode. Marshall needs to move forward, as Judy clearly has."

HIMYM,2ysoru,AlWinchester,5,Fri Mar 13 08:28:37 2015 UTC,"Oh, honey...   Marshall's not home, he's in St. Cloud, Minnesota. Him being away brings a unique situation. I'm guessing that the bigger the guest star, the less likely they are to sleep with one of the main characters. There's a bunch of random bimbos, and the one time Barney can't get it done with a girl he wanted was when Katy Perry guest starred. Katy Perry guest stars as... Honey! Nobody can remember her actual name, but her extreme gullibility makes her a target of pity for the gang/target for Barney. Damn Ted, I know you didn't know Zoey and The Captain were divorced but she was more than enthusiastic to hook up with you. You got so lost in your own feelings that you couldn't even notice hers! Marcus is home! He seems a lot better adjusted to his dad dying than Marshall, to be honest. Judy may not like Lily, but she sure likes the rest of the gang!   Now the big problem with Zoey is that she's a great character, but she's so mismatched with Ted it's fucking ridiculous. I think this is pointed out by Robin in more than a few episodes that Zoey was both a great girl and a terrible girlfriend."

She overworked herself and hadn't eaten in 3 days. She truly loved her husband, but she doesn't really grieve Marvin so much.  Marshall's idiot brothers are back! They show up around once a season for the rest of the series, but their moments with their dad were pretty poignant.  New actor for Robin Sherbatsky Sr., Ray Wise. The original actor didn't feel his part was ""substantial enough"" to come to the show, so they just blatantly recast him.  The tiny priest is Trey, played by Buffy's Danny Strong. God, what an asshole that guy was.  Barney finally decides to talk to his dad and find out who he is. This comes not too long later in the season.  I think this may be the last time Ted's dad shows up for the rest of the series. He's taking after Barney, and is dating Ted's prom date. Boy it isn't pretty.    It's a great episode, despite my trivia entries sounding like I'm trashing it. A lot of shows avoid the grief someone may feel when going through that situation.

HIMYM,2ynys9,Domyfranky,4,Wed Mar 11 10:47:20 2015 UTC,"I've heard from writers that stories do evolve from what was originally planned and the ending has to change accordingly. And I do think that HIMYM could have been one of those cases where the story could have taken out the Ted/Robin ending and been all the better for it.  I also do believe that you can stick to an ending and have the story still be good, and I see what you're saying in that the story as written didn't do a good job transitioning the story. They seemed to have the major plot points in place and manipulated the characters so that they reached those plot points at a certain time. And I think the story became more artificial because of it. Like Barney and Robin have to get married. That's gotta happen because we decided it a long time ago. So we need to get them together. But we're going to split them up in the finale so try to make their relationship feel forced on paper and don't dig deep into their actual relationship as to what makes them work/not work. If we dig too deep we might find something that alters what we already have in store, so don't explore the situation too much and just keep repeating the same things over and over like trust is an issue or we're both alphas instead of diving deeper into the psyche of the relationship and finding out what makes them tick/not tick.  I didn't mean to make this about the issues of Barney/Robin but since I'm typing it one of the biggest writing exercises that I feel like the writers avoided like the plague was Robin's vows to Barney. Just writing those up and finding out why Robin fell in love with Barney in the first place (A) should have been in the episode of their wedding and (B) was necessary in order to see the relationship and how it works. But no, the show can't go into that. They know that Robin/Barney divorce later and never get back together down the line, so we can't dive into why they're in love now. That could change the story. But they still need to get married! Ted meets the Mother there! That's happening!  Rant basically boils down to the story stopped feeling like a story at certain points and just started being about a series of events that they needed to check off the list and made sure they hit, which is bad. Worse is that might have been less noticeable or excusable if the episodes themselves were full of interesting stories/concepts, and sometimes they are. I'll probably make a thread soon enough to ask about the good of season 9 since there is a fair amount in the season that's enjoyable. But there's also a lot of flimsiness as well."
HIMYM,2ynys9,gizmo1492,1 point,Thu Mar 12 01:58:08 2015 UTC,Very interesting analysis.
HIMYM,2ynys9,rose_tattoo,6,Thu Mar 12 09:01:28 2015 UTC,"I think Bays and Thomas only wrote about 60 of the 208 episodes. The fact that people are still on message boards discussing the show a year after it has finished is testament to the characters they created   I loved the HIMYM ending,but thinking at the complete story,i think their writing trough the series was very confused sometimes,and i think that maybe they were too closed-minded about the ending of the show. They should have been more open-minded to change the ending if necessary,instead i think they used the exact script they wrote in 2006,and they didn't changed almost nothing of it.   Writers normally have a start, middle and end when they create stories, why should they have changed theirs? Were they supposed to have a different ending because certain people thought it should be that way? A lot of posters predicted that this how the story was going to end and even why Ted was telling the story in the fist place.  They needed ratings and they got extra seasons. The show lost a lot of it's heart and become over the top slapstick comedy.  I would watch any project that Bays and Thomas create"
HIMYM,2ynys9,rose_tattoo,2,Wed Mar 11 13:17:03 2015 UTC,"I think the story evolved in a different way. They wrote the ending in 2006,during season 2,when Ted and Robin were together and they were the center of the story and Barney was only a comical sidekick. Trough the years,the story took a different direction (and they were in charge of it,so they knew it) Barney became more and more the main character of the story,his relationship with Robin became one of the central themes (Almost all the cliffchangers of season finales and season premiers are dedicated to them) and Ted was often relegated to B-Plotlines with Marshall and Lily. So i think they should AT LEAST try to think to a different solution...then of course they can decide what they want. I think they never tried to think at a different solution...they said ""in 2006 we decided this so it will be this,end of the story"" but i think that if you have a story that is 9 years long,you should at least try to reconsider to change something. It's only my opinion,of course,and i really loved the ending. But i don't blame the people who believed in Barney-Robin  and then they saw this couple disappeared immediately and never mentioned again. I agreed with the divorce,but after it they should at least show more Barney and Robin talk about it,and deal with it a little more...instead,it was ""we got divorced,end of the story,now Robin is in love with Ted again and Barney came back to womanizing"". I mean,i agree with the plot choice,i loved that Robin was in love with Ted again and Barney came back to womanizing,but i would have prefered if it would have passed more time to elaborate this new situation for what it became the central couple of the story (for a lot of people they were it)."
HIMYM,2ynys9,rose_tattoo,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:03:27 2015 UTC,"The story didn't evolve differently.The popularity of Barney changed and the writers wanted to cash in on that to get the ratings. Season 5 had nothing to do with Ted meeting the Mother. real or fake. Had Barney not been as popular we probably would not have gotten that story line. Since we did get that storyline then they had to change Robin or Barney to make them fit, since they didn't want to change Barney, Robins character underwent a major change (salute) to the point where people started hating her character.   Robin and Barney for me were a horrible couple and they were written that way, so if people were watching through shippers goggles the writers can't help that.  Regardless of the screen time Barney and Robin got, it was still going to be Teds story at the end.  If you loved the story why do you care about other people who didn't?"
HIMYM,2ynys9,ZDHELIX,1 point,Sun Mar 15 02:47:00 2015 UTC,"Listen,i think you did a good analysis but you missed some points: You said that Barney and Robin was written in a horrible way,but i don't think it's true. Of course they had their issues,but they wrote them as a romantic couple,a couple meant to be.Look at ""The Final Page"",look at ""Ring Up"",look at ""The Rehersal Dinner"" for example. There's a reason if a lot of people believed in them. I think this writing was confusing toward the viewers,and i don't know if it was intentional or if it's because the other writers of the staff didn't know about the ending,so they wrote Barney and Robin like a couple meant to be...but in this last case,it's still Bays and Thomas's fault,because they were the showrunners and they knew about the ending,so they had to say to the other writers ""we can't write Barney and Robin in a certain way"" and they didn't. And i think this was a very serious mistake. Then you said ""Why do you care about the people who didn't like it"" well,in this topic we are talking about the Bays-Thomas's ability in writing,so of course we have to care and to consider the perception of the viewers,because i think that a good writer has to consider the perception that the viewers will have of his story."
HIMYM,2ynys9,rose_tattoo,1 point,Sun Mar 15 10:24:09 2015 UTC,"They were never written as a romantic couple. The characters the themselves acknowledge that they are not into that romantic crap. People saw them as two broken people with commitment issues and Daddy issues and decided they should be together because of that.   The episodes that you mention are all about Barney and his ""plays"" how he lies and manipulates Robin that's not healthy. Even Marshall says that you can't have relationship continually waiting for the ""gotcha""  Nobody is going to to like the sames things, that's a given you only have to worry about whether you like it."

HIMYM,2yk33o,henrykazuka,3,Tue Mar 10 16:33:19 2015 UTC,"I was pretty disappointed by the finale as well but it's been two or so months since I've finished the show and I've learned to appreciate some things about it. This comment from /u/darwin2500 helped me accept some truths about the message of the show.   The series doesn't show us that Ted and Robin shouldn't be together. It shows us that Robin can never be 'The One' for Ted, and therefore, Ted rejects her and looks for other options. In the finale, it's revealed that Ted has realized that his idealistic fixation on 'The One' was in fact juvenile and counter-productive, preventing him from appreciating the amazing things in his life and sabotaging his otherwise good relationships (that's why the story of 'How I Met Your Mother' doesn't involve the mother, he's teaching his kids to appreciate life by showing all the amazing things that happened to him before he met The One, and how his fixation on The One made him disengage and not appreciate it all enough at the time). That's why he ends up going to Robin - she can't be 'The One', but she can make him very happy right now and they can have a much better life together than if they are both sitting alone in their homes, depressively mourning the absence/loss of 'The One' in their lives. There, I've actually defended the ending and told you what it means and why it is appropriate to the message of the show. What's your response?   However, I still think the last episode was too chock full of big event anouncements, one after another to work very well. It was hasty and the pacing was all wrong.  Still the best sit com I've ever seen."
HIMYM,2yk33o,jeteaway,3,Tue Mar 10 16:35:54 2015 UTC,"The pacing and production was definitely an absolute mess, for a number of reasons.  I'd only defend the semiotics of the episode, not the overall quality."

HIMYM,2yk33o,jelatinman,2,Thu Mar 12 04:42:34 2015 UTC,"I have caught a few episodes on rerun after the finale, but have the same troubles getting through them as you do. I know it's a broken record, but the finale pacing really just left me in a wash after the end of S9 to the point where it seems almost futile, knowing how it ends. I used to look to the show for inspiration and paralells, thinking ""hey, these are my 'McLaren's days' with my friends, and I totally know a Barney, or totally know a Robin!"", and now I approach it thinking that they told some fun stories but it's not happily ever after. I often used to wish that as I got older, I would have some of the same types of crazy stories to tell my kids, but found that Ted has a future that I don't wish for parallels with anymore.  Somewhere around S5 or so Ted crosses into more of a 'learn from my mistakes' type character than a direct relational one to me. And I thought in S8 and into the speech he gives Robin at her wedding we were finally done with Ted and Robin being pushed together. Ted was just about to meet Tracy and move on to what he had been waiting for all of his adult years. Turns out that life is rough, and sometimes the worst and unexpected happens no matter what you do and we lose Tracy just as quick as we met her (quicker, as an audience). And while Ted had over a decade to process those emotions, we are immediately met with talk from the Mosby kids telling him to 'go get Robin'!   I've meant to watch the other cut of the finale, supposedly it spaces things out a little bit, but I honestly lost the sort of draw and magic that I used to have for the show and its characters. They handled some real subjects like 'Marshall's dad', 'Robin's infertility', etc very well, but I don't believe that the 'Tracy's sickness and beyond in 5 min or less' was one of them.   The best thing about the HIMYM finale is that it made me really appreciate how well P&R handled theirs in comparison, lol."
HIMYM,2yk33o,CaptQueso,2,Tue Mar 10 19:47:34 2015 UTC,"With the deleted scenes inserted, it goes at a much better pace. In particular there's a diner scene that shows why Ted went for Robin after the mother died, while still indicating that the mother would always be his first choice."

It's like the finale revealed that ""How I Met Your Mother"" never existed, only ""Why I want to date Aunt Robin"". And now when I go back and try to watch all I ever find is the second show, the first show is gone forever. And I really, REALLY  miss the first show."

HIMYM,2yh6a8,maverickLI,13,Mon Mar 9 20:31:51 2015 UTC,"It added a realness to the show that is absent in many sitcoms, as did how Ted and the Mother's story ended. While from a TV show stand point it seemed wrong or unnecessary, the realness of the show differentiates it from others and to me makes it better than others. (if that makes sense)"
HIMYM,2yh6a8,Shortyspade,3,Mon Mar 9 21:46:42 2015 UTC,"The thing is: a whole season for the wedding, few minutes for the divorce. I understand and accept that they divorced, but I wish it was better developed :/"
HIMYM,2yh6a8,arthurazs,3,Tue Mar 10 06:17:16 2015 UTC,"I think it was a good story to show. It added a realistic element, and allowed the finale to show a variety of outcomes for a love story- breakup (Barney and Robin's divorce), lifelong love (Marshall and Lily), early death of one of the partners (Ted and Tracy), and moving on past that death (Ted and Robin).   That being said, I think that while the Barney-Robin pairing made the most sense, Carter and Craig were probably pressured to give more screen time to Barney and Robin because they got more viewers. I loved hearing about Ted's story, and the last few seasons of the show felt like the adventures of Barney and Robin (and sometimes the rest of the gang). Barney went from a comic relief and foil for Ted to the focus of a majority of A-stories in later seasons. The Barney-Robin pairing made sense, but the amount of attention it got was frustrating for a big fan of it being Ted's story."
HIMYM,2yh6a8,bludevil22,6,Tue Mar 10 17:44:33 2015 UTC,"Like Maverick said, I think it was a good idea, and the ending was realistic.  Marriages don't work out, as much as 50+% of the time, in the US.  It is totally realistic that they would have decided to marry, both tried to change who they are to make it work, and then see the marriage fail because one or the other would become upset over the issues in the marriage...."
HIMYM,2yh6a8,Ericws,3,Mon Mar 9 20:56:56 2015 UTC,"The idea was good, I just think the execution was horrible.

HIMYM,2yh6a8,NikolaiHabibulin,4,Tue Mar 10 06:57:24 2015 UTC,The original story could have worked with better execution. The story could have also worked and had Robin/Barney stay together with better execution too. The way it ended up being written wasn't very good though IMO.

I thought they would've tried to work it out better since they're awesome communication with each other and willing to work out. Don't get me wrong, Ted and Robin have a great dynamic with each other but they've worked out best as best friends. The writers said that they've planned the ending for years and I don't agree with the ending whatsoever. All though, at the same time it was beautifully written with all of the hints throughout the whole show. Re-watching it recently, I see all of them. And it's annoying but sweet at the same time. My most biggest complaint about the ending though I have to say, It's way too rushed. I wouldn't even mind keeping that same ending, but I would've liked to seen it more drawn out, building the suspense the way HIMYM should've ended, would've been more beautiful that way. Also, I thought the last episode should've had slightly more humor but that's just me personally to not end on such a serious note."
HIMYM,2yh6a8,Sanaria21,1 point,Tue Mar 10 08:59:28 2015 UTC,"I feel like they were a missed opportunity in a lot of ways. Yes, they got together but I feel like it was just bungled so badly. I thought they would've been better as a very unconventional couple. Like their relationship would be considered open but both of them would never really stray, they just had the option to stray. And they'd never label themselves as boyfriend/girlfriend and so on. Making them be all conventional as hell just really put a damper on the pairing. They were sitting on a goldmine with them and never unearthed it."
HIMYM,2yh6a8,pineyfusion,1 point,Sat Mar 14 22:32:28 2015 UTC,"Anyway i'm not just asking about the wedding,i'm asking about their entire relationship: Was it a good idea to develop this couple so much during the latest seasons? Or they should instead better focusing on Ted-Robin relationship? Some people believed that Barney-Robin was the center of the story (and in fact,almost all the season finale and premiere seasons were dedicated to them) but they were wrong. So why give them all this screentime?"
HIMYM,2yh6a8,RusVir,1 point,Tue Mar 10 08:59:32 2015 UTC,"I have a theory - Barney and Robin's relationship was heavily focused because Ted exaggerated it in his story. He focused on them a lot because he wanted to explain to his kids that even though they got divorced, they really loved each other while they were together. Ted believed that Robin was better off with Barney than with him, which is why he was hesitant to get back with her in 2030; and that is why he was telling the story."
HIMYM,2yh6a8,Ericws,0,Tue Mar 10 19:06:41 2015 UTC,"Because C&C were trying to extend out a show that they expected would run for a far shorter duration?  The better alternative would have been to bring Tracy in earlier.  It was clear from the pilot that Robin was not ""the mother"", and the Ted-Robin storyline was a consistent them throughout, so i can't see what more could have been done with them."
HIMYM,2yh6a8,Ericws,-1,Tue Mar 10 17:13:31 2015 UTC,"Other relationships? Or maybe they should at that point change their plan for the story,like all the other writers do."
HIMYM,2yh6a8,Ericws,0,Tue Mar 10 18:36:43 2015 UTC,"Well, they did that too, didn't they?  How many more relationships could they make those characters go through?  Ted got jilted more times than i can count.  Barney got laid more times than i can count.  And Robin got laid more than that."
HIMYM,2yh6a8,Philofelinist,0,Tue Mar 10 21:09:37 2015 UTC,"I mean other serious relationship,not just ""one episode-relationships"". Anyway i think the writers was very,very confused in their writing...sometimes i ask myself why they wrote episodes like ""Baby Talk"" when they had that ending in mind...it just doesn't have sense,it's a confusing writing...and i wonder if they understood their mistakes or they'll do it again in their next works...judging bt their behaviour post-finale,i think maybe they didn't understood their mistakes."
HIMYM,2yh6a8,gizmo1492,0,Wed Mar 11 10:38:17 2015 UTC,"Another question i forgot to ask in the title: Was their break-up handled well by the writers? I mean: during season 9 there wasn't one hint about the fact that Robin would have started to travel after the wedding,and that Barney might don't like this..i think this issue was valid but almost came out of nowhere. What do you think about it?"
HIMYM,2yh6a8,rose_tattoo,1 point,Mon Mar 9 21:51:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think it came out of nowhere.  Robin was always career-oriented, and the new position would call for that.  She chose it.  barney tried to accommodate, to his best.  This again is how marriages go sometimes.  his resentment led to conflict, which led to the marital breakup."
HIMYM,2yh6a8,rose_tattoo,1 point,Mon Mar 9 22:11:17 2015 UTC,"It seemed to. It was never really shown that Barney would be opposed to the travelling and it implied that the divorce was Robin's fault. The travel would have provided good material for Barney's blog.  Ted married a very busy woman as well, sigh."
HIMYM,2yh6a8,rose_tattoo,3,Mon Mar 9 22:46:37 2015 UTC,"Robin gave an out, yeah, but Barney did agree to it. The divorce ultimately was a mutual decision even if Robin was the instigator.  Barney's side of things though definitely needed to be shown more. I think the finale showed that even during travel Robin never made time for him, but Barney being opposed to traveling in general should have been shown better than ""there's no wifi for my blog"" especially since a blog is one of the few things can literally can be done during travel."

If you want to start a new direction, go ahead and try.  It is hard to overcome the fact that no new material will ever be made so there is nothing much new to talk about.  The finale was particularly ""final"", in that it referred back to the pilot and tied up everything in between, so it is hard not to analyze the series as a whole- it is what the series creators designed!    So, good luck with your hope. Controversial finale + storyline from start to finish where the finale truly impacted the entirety of the series = this discussion goes on forever!"

I think people get that the show had a mixed ending. Calling it out for the 100th time does not make it anymore true or right. It is not like new people are coming out of the woods to say the ending sucked, it the same people who have posted over and over again flooding this sub-reddit with it since the finale ended."
HIMYM,2yfrqm,Ericws,2,Mon Mar 9 13:27:47 2015 UTC,"I will give this sub-reddit some credit.  After my initial shock at what had happened, talking it through on here helped me to gain perspective on how ""time travelers"", ""HYMMM"" and ""Vesuvius"" served the role of Ted's honoring Tracy's memory, so that the actual ending was not as jarring and tone-deaf as it initially seemed.  This place helped me see the overall myth of the story better."

People have a right to complain about anything, and I believe the finale was supposed to be relatively controversial among fans, similar to the rest of the series, but the finale bashing is getting rather old in my opinion.   Maybe create a 'Finale complaint' thread to give people a chance to get it out of their system.   Even if you absolutely hate the finale (and if you do I respectfully disagree) There are 206 legendary, often impactful episodes of television you are ignoring by saying that two could ruin the series.  This show has meant so much to so many of us. Don't forget the power it has had."
HIMYM,2yfrqm,Sir-Zeph,1 point,Mon Mar 9 22:48:23 2015 UTC,I loved the finale and didn't find anything wrong with it. The whole serious was indeed based on detailed accounts of his journey up to the point where he met the Mother. However when Ted is done telling the story of how he met the mother the creators of the show take it a step further to show how his life ends up back in the present. The show is about how he met the mother but it is also about how he found the one (Robin) but hasn't really 'found' her till the end where his kids push him to go for it. It was the perfect ending to the story. After over a decade he still pursued what he believed in from the start.
HIMYM,2yfrqm,Domyfranky,1 point,Tue Mar 10 08:36:32 2015 UTC,"I loved the finale but i disagree with you. I think the finale was done by Bays and Thomas with this purpose,they knew it would have been divisory. So it's perfectly normal to continue to speak about it,especially considering that there is nothing new in the horizon (No HIMYD,No new Bays-Thomas's series yet,No new tv shows with HIMYM's actors yet) so in this period there isn't anything new to talk about."

HIMYM,2yawo0,gizmo1492,19,Sun Mar 8 02:59:27 2015 UTC,"I always enjoyed the ending simply because it explains so much that was wrong, and weird about the show in the first place. When watching the show two things always seem out of place; the focus on Robin, and the long tales of all the other girls Ted loved/banged. The show definitely shows how Ted has loved many a lady before he met the kids mother but still married her over them. For me the finale, really explained this by Ted saying he loves Aunt Robin. It kind of shows how a person doesn't just have one love, they have many  tl:dr the show explains how there are many loves in ones life time, not just one"
HIMYM,2yawo0,themenace95,7,Sun Mar 8 12:41:17 2015 UTC,"In a way this is even alluded to in the pilot. Ted's first line is something along the lines of ""in 2005, before I was dad, I was a completely different person"" with the advent of the finale we see that HIMYM was about how we live many lives over the course of our years and age in out of the various people we are in those lives.  HIMYM is in a way simultaneously about at least 3 Ted's. Ted BM, a young insecure guy who doesn't understand what he wants in a relationship and who has unrealistic expectations about love. Ted WM who has matured into being with and so totally loving a woman enough to start over and begin a family. Ted AM a single father who while still deeply in love with his deceased wife recognizes that life is a short and beautiful thing that needs to be shared with the people we love most deeply.   I have my structural issues with the series' final seasons and even the finale but while and imperfect piece of art it's a story that is hopelessly absent from our media and when taken at a glance easy to discredit. Love is too big for happily ever after."
HIMYM,2yawo0,bandit515,5,Sun Mar 8 17:16:32 2015 UTC,"That last sentence,  that was beautiful man"
HIMYM,2yawo0,themenace95,22,Sun Mar 8 22:58:44 2015 UTC,"Most of this is good, but personally I would switch between timelines, similar to the Parks and Rec finale for those of you who saw that.  Move along, show us all of this good stuff, introduce Tracy, the illness, Barney&Robin's relationship collapse, etc. throughout the series, but for me, the final episode has to end with Ted and Tracy finally meeting at Farhampton."

HIMYM,2yawo0,FreedomAndTruthiness,2,Sun Mar 8 16:27:40 2015 UTC,The problem with that would be how they would be able to go so many episodes without ever speaking the Mother's name.
HIMYM,2yawo0,RusVir,2,Mon Mar 9 16:05:28 2015 UTC,"I think they could. Remember, they didn't say her name for 9 years (Except for 1x9 and 9x24) They could very easily have avoided it, as they did throughout season nine, sticking with pronouns, pet names, etc."
HIMYM,2yawo0,FreedomAndTruthiness,1 point,Mon Mar 9 19:54:00 2015 UTC,"Till then it was easy as they were all just meeting her, but in expanding the finale's story where they all know her and she's part of the group it would be really hard."
HIMYM,2yawo0,RusVir,1 point,Mon Mar 9 21:58:16 2015 UTC,"Never doubt the magic or pronouns.   If they wanted to, the writers could have made it a joke with the fans, intentionally dodging the mother's name, how far will they go to to hide it?"
HIMYM,2yawo0,FreedomAndTruthiness,4,Mon Mar 9 22:23:09 2015 UTC,"This article raises two big creative choices for the show's ending, and fans can agree to either, both, or neither. The first is Tracy dying. The second is the final season being all about the wedding weekend.  I think Tracy dying is a fine ending to the show. I could see the show breaking out of the one-weekend format, but it hardly ruined anything for me.  I think the suggestion to drag out the Barney/Robin divorce is a mistake, though. The writer is forgetting that we all figured out Tracy's death from a hand hold and a meaningful glance. A few unspoken words in a preceding episode were enough to completely telegraph where the plot was heading. Foreshadowing the divorce wasn't necessary beyond the spats they had leading up to the announcement that they were splitting up. We saw them together, and it was already believable enough that they didn't work."
HIMYM,2yawo0,transmogrify,1 point,Sun Mar 8 17:03:59 2015 UTC,Agreed on the Robin-Barney divorce.  That was a marriage destined for divorce from the get-go.
HIMYM,2yawo0,Ericws,7,Mon Mar 9 17:32:05 2015 UTC,"Did you forgot Tracy's backstory? (That we saw in episode 9x16) I think it's important. Anyway,this idea is interesting,but i think that in this way the story would have been ""too slow"" and i think so much people would have complained anyway."
HIMYM,2yawo0,Domyfranky,8,Sun Mar 8 11:09:58 2015 UTC,"Gotta say I agree with pretty much everything written here, minus some nitpicky stuff. (For example, I agree Tracy needed more screen time, but I do think what she was given was enough for us to care about her, including the way she interacted with Lily/Marshall and the future scenes with Ted).  Some of the ideas for episodes are kinda silly too, but pretty interesting. So I guess I'm also wondering if you were trimming season 9, what would you keep/not keep?"
HIMYM,2yawo0,RusVir,2,Sun Mar 8 03:02:57 2015 UTC,"Yes this all looks good on paper, but I'll say again it couldn't really be made that way. The finale's plot could not be extended into multiple episodes. Here's why:   Ted's story ends with him meeting Tracy. The future events of the finale are a different phase of his life and are not part of that story. Ted didn't have to tell his kids about what they already knew. Being a sitcom it wasn't practical as there wouldn't be place for comedy with all the sad stuff happening and it would become a soap opera.   One thing I agree with is that there could have been just a couple of additional scenes showing Barney and Robin very happy together in their first year of marriage and then slowly breaking apart.  The finale really was thwarted by the contrasting pace of the over-stretched wedding weekend, but that was all Jason Segel's fault."
HIMYM,2yawo0,RusVir,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:50:15 2015 UTC,"1-2) Given the kids seemed to have heard the short story about how he met Tracy, and the story was ultimately about Robin anyways, it'd probably be justifiable to have Ted continue the story after he Met the Mother, plus even though they were ""alive"", a lot of the story would have been when they were too young to remember/fully grasp the situation anyways. Plus, we saw glimpses of their future together anyways in season 9.  3) I'd argue though having a sitcom finale be so bittersweet/sad is also the incorrect way to go out.  I'd also argue it would have been easier to film scenes without Marshall after the wedding and have it be less jarring during the year they were in Rome since he'd be in Rome and Lily could have just had scenes doing her job."
HIMYM,2yawo0,Ericws,1 point,Mon Mar 9 18:21:07 2015 UTC,"1-2) You have a point but as I said after he met Tracy it was a different time of their lives and a different story, which he may have told them before already or some other time. And more specifically for the later years, he didn't have to go into the details of things like Tracy's death and mourning of which they had first-hand experience. Also flashforwards in the show were always brief and shown as either the result of or a framing device for what happened in the past, but not the focus of the main story.  3) HIMYM is a sitcom but not a traditional sitcom, it had lots of dramatic and emotional moments so I think a bittersweet ending was fitting for it. At the same time, the dramatic episodes had comedy too and it couldn't go all the way to the other end by having episodes that are all drama with no jokes."
HIMYM,2yawo0,RusVir,1 point,Mon Mar 9 21:42:22 2015 UTC,Why was it Jason Segel's fault?
HIMYM,2yawo0,Domyfranky,3,Mon Mar 9 17:31:15 2015 UTC,"He wanted to leave the show after season 8 when everyone else was on board for season 9. They did a lot of negotiating with him but he refused to stay on. So season 9 remained uncertain and they wrote season 8 as if it were the last. When Jason finally changed his mind it was too late, they were already through most of S8 and all that was left for S9 was the wedding weekend. Jason also gave a condition that he couldn't follow the filming schedule and his scenes be shot separately for the first half of S9. Hence they had to put Marshall on a road trip further holding back the plot progression.  If there had been no issues with Jason and they had a confirmed S9 from the start, they would have paced it better by slowing down S8 and expanding the first half of the year so that Barney proposed to Robin at the end of the season rather than mid-season. Then S9 would have been an expanded second half of the year, i.e. the second half of the S8 we got plus a shorter wedding weekend."
HIMYM,2yawo0,Tall_Rassman,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:30:01 2015 UTC,"because if he would not have signed for season 9,the series would have finished in season 8 (and,according to me,it would have been better,like RusVir said)"
HIMYM,2yawo0,Tall_Rassman,-10,Mon Mar 9 19:33:37 2015 UTC,"The finale is over, move on already. I love this sub-reddit but the continuous winning is getting to be too much. Was the finale perfect, no but it could of been a lot worse. Let's celebrate the show going forward instead of complaining constantly and filling this place with the same recycled garbage ideas on how they would of made the last season great."
HIMYM,2yca0l,jelatinman,10,Sun Mar 8 15:05:15 2015 UTC,"Oh shit. This one.  Two things I wanna mention; this was one of the funniest episodes in the series which, in my opinion, made the ending even harder to watch.  The second is that this was the realest HIMYM had gotten so far. They'd done some pretty real and dramatic things, but this episode really proved that they were able to go the distance.  And the fact that Marvin Erikson was a recurring character and we'd Seen his and Marshall's relationship first hand helped the audience know what to feel.  While I loved the finale, I think this is where they went wrong with Tracy's death. They proved to us in this episode and the episode that followed it that they knew how to handle a death scene and make it meaningful.  The fact that a character as beautiful and amazing as Tracy simply got a one second montage while a minor character got such a moving send off, made a lot of fans feel as though they'd lost a slap bet."
HIMYM,2yca0l,Swankified_Tristan,3,Sun Mar 8 22:23:39 2015 UTC,"One of the first new, first-run episodes my wife and I saw, as we caught on late and binged through Netflix and DVDs to catch up.   It aired in early January of that year, and coincidentally enough, aired on the anniversary of my wife's father's death. I recall seeing the ending and looking over at her and seeing the tears rolling down, as that day is clearly sensitive.  Up to that point, we loved Marshall and Lily as a couple and loved the entire show... That episode just put our connection to the show on another level."
HIMYM,2yca0l,rbarton812,3,Sun Mar 8 21:09:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this has been suggested or not, but something that might be nice is to include a link to a review that was done at the time of the episode  For example AVClub to see how people reacted at the time. Alternatively if there were reddit threads previously it might be cool to link them, but I don't think the community on reddit was large enough at the time.  It let's people compare how people felt at the time and reflecting back at now after time has passed."

HIMYM,2y82do,gizmo1492,1 point,Sat Mar 7 15:08:34 2015 UTC,Yeah. I see Barney/Robin as the same scenario but it's what would have happened if Ted's mom pursued her passion instead of falling complacent and living out the life Ted's dad wanted.

Ted points out in the episode that his mom and Clint got married that that he believes she was never happier than during the time after she married Clint. The exact words were ""being with your Grandpa Clint was the best decision your grandma has ever made""."
HIMYM,2y82do,rose_tattoo,3,Sat Mar 7 15:27:52 2015 UTC,Ted meets and marries Tracy and they are together for 11yrs. Robin has had her career and is a successful business woman now. They now have the opportunity to re-connect. Why are they incompatible in 2030?

I'm saying your statement of Ted/Robin being the opposite of Ted's parents isn't really the case. The two very much share the same views as their younger counterparts.  To play devil's advocate though, Ted's parents had kids that grew up. Why did they end up getting divorced still, and after the kids left too?"

Anyways, I can find times where Ted is being a dork and Robin is appreciative (like during the Weird Al episode, she seems amused when Ted was telling the story of Like a Surgeon), but then there's other times like Not a Father's Day with the shredded tweet joke.   I guess Robin also just seemed less in tune with the dorkier sides of Ted as well. The penny's one big example (and played a big enough part in his life with Tracey to name their kids after a Penny). I also can't see Robin being excited to go to something like the Renaissance Fair or the like. Or at least I can see that perspective."

But she fell in love with Ted even with those idiosyncrasies and dated him for a year, Jen and Ted didn't last one date so on some level Robin must have accepted those. We also saw in Ted Mosby: Architect that even though they have different tastes in movies and careers Robin wants to be the one Ted bitches too. Ted/Robin actions were the opposite to Al/Virginia. Having kids was the one thing broke up Ted and Robin; even though she did rick getting pregnant in Something Blue.   To play devil's advocate though, Ted's parents had kids that grew up. Why did they end up getting divorced still, and after the kids left too?   It's a tricky question. The counter question would be why didn't they get divorced a lot earlier if they were so unhappy. We saw Al move on to make beer and hook up with younger women and Virginia seemed to be ""baked"" alot but still a house wife.  Do you think if Clint died would Al and Virgina get back together?"

HIMYM,2y332w,GoochMasterFlash,15,Fri Mar 6 02:53:56 2015 UTC,For me it's more that we had to watch Ted get over Robin so many times just to see him wound up with her in the end.

That is the big issue with the series, because over the 9 seasons, Ted actually learned to let her go(one of the important steps in that process, that's why he goes into detail about their relationship so much).  The finals said ""oh fuck what this show became, let's use the stupid ass ending we planned from the beginning, which no longer fits with the series, and ruin it."

It may be what they wanted, but what hey made didn't deserve that ending.  They unintentionally worked themselves out of that ending, which is why it was so out of place and angered so many people.  The ending no longer fit what the series had become and they were too stubborn to change it."
HIMYM,2y332w,Oatmeal_Addict,4,Fri Mar 6 16:12:25 2015 UTC,"Why does there need to be a reason other than Ted wants to tell the story to his children? Its very obvious throughout the series that he loves this story and telling it, why wouldn't he tell them just to tell me them? That's good enough reason for me.   Because you don't tell your teenage kids how you cheated on a woman to be with their ""Aunt"" Robin or how their ""Aunt"" Lily walked out on their ""Uncle"" Marshall; or how their ""Aunt"" Robin and ""Uncle"" Barney cheated on their partners with each other.; or how their ""Aunt"" Robin wanted to run off with him before her wedding, just for the sake of telling a story.    It may be what they wanted, but what hey made didn't deserve that ending. They unintentionally worked themselves out of that ending, which is why it was so out of place and angered so many people. The ending no longer fit what the series had become and they were too stubborn to change it.   It angered the Barney/Robin shippers. Most people didn't like it because of the speed of the execution not the content."
HIMYM,2y332w,rose_tattoo,-1,Fri Mar 6 22:37:39 2015 UTC,"Cheating on Victoria was part of the process, it needed to be told, so they could understand the full extent.  Lily and Marshall breaking up was a huge event in their lives and something they all had to deal with.  Same with Marshall's dad dying.  If those events were huge events for Ted, and they were, why wouldn't he include them in his story?  I've been told weird ass stories by my parents.  I've been told stories about how they lost their parents.  I was there for one of them, and will be for the last one in a few years.  They are big moments for people and affect everyone around them.  Ted and Marshall are so close, Marshall's father dying probably felt almost as bad to Ted, if only because of how bad Marshall was feeling.    Those parts might not have been completely essential to How he met their mother, but they were big moments in his life he wanted to tell them about.  As for Robin and Barney cheating, that's part of their love story and showed them getting back together.  It was important to their story and while that fact may not be the best to include when telling his kids, he did it anyway.  Ted's a perfectionist.  And he also makes bad decisions, this was one of them.  And this is just an argument in general, it has the same issues with either ending.  If he was asking them for permission to be with Robin, why would he need to tell them about that anyway?  It did anger the shippers, sure.  But it also angered people who loved Ted's character development and the evolution of the story.  Throughout the course of the show, there was always the question of whether Ted was truly over Robin or not.  And the answer was always no.  UNTIL the final season.  They did an entire episode showing that he finally and truly was letting her go, and she floated into the sky, away from him, he was finally free.  He could never have been with Tracy if he had not gotten over Robin.  That was by far the most important step.  And when he finally reached that point, he met her.  Because it was time.  That's the point of EVERYTHING with him and Robin, she was important in his life.  But when he finally was able to let her go, and be free, he could meet the perfect woman.  He wanted them to understand the gravity (no pun intended) of the situation and how important it really was to him.  The writers didn't need to add this part in, but they did, because they needed to.  Because Ted needed to be done with her.  He had to be done with her.  Had they truly wanted him to end up with Robin, they should not have had this happen.  Ted would still love Robin, and after the mother dies, would make sense for him to run back to her.  This of course would shit all over Tracy, but that's basically what they wanted to do anyway.  My point is that they told the story the natural way, and naturally, Ted was over her completely, and the whole final scene completely ruined that development and felt weird, unnatural, and just downright bad writing.  Just because you WANT to do something a certain way, doesn't mean it SHOULD be that way.  The best example I can give here is George Lucas.  If the original trilogy was the way he originally WANTED it, it would have been dreadful.  That is why the prequels are so terrible, because he got his way for them.  The original trilogy, before he had the power to demand things done a certain way, smarter people said no to stupid ideas because they didn't work.  Then he went back and kept trying to change the original trilogy over and over again.  NO.  It was done and perfect, that was not something he should have done, and people hate him for it.  The writers wanted Ted to be with Robin, but because of that scene and everything leading up to it, it was wrong.  It no longer was the way the story was going and they forced it back in, which is the issue."
HIMYM,2y332w,Oatmeal_Addict,3,Sat Mar 7 05:47:38 2015 UTC,I think you should rewatch the alt ending..
HIMYM,2y332w,Domyfranky,1 point,Sat Mar 7 06:25:11 2015 UTC,You should rewatch the show because you have missed the point. Why do you think that Ted is telling the kids the story in such detail. The kids already knew how their parents met.
HIMYM,2y332w,Spritesgud,0,Fri Mar 6 13:22:15 2015 UTC,"The entire (alt) ending is a recap of how love kicks him down over and over again, all starting with Robin, until it all became worth it when he met Tracy. The original ending makes all the in-between pointless* because he just ended up at square one all over again, the story's still good, but it's a different lesson/reasoning. He's telling them in detail so that they take away that everything, every single failure and turn in life, happens for a reason. The story isn't about him winning the girl in the end, it's about him accepting his losses until he's finally ready to win the jackpot.  Whether or not that jackpot could be considered Tracy or Robin is up to the viewer and which finale they chose to go with. I won't argue that him ending up with Robin doesn't make sense, all I'm saying is the story makes just as much sense (if not more) that he ended up with Tracy. It's the same story, different end goal.  Saying that Ted was just bragging about his bangs while Tracy sits idly by isn't fair. He ached and ached, learning how hard life is, so that he would be ready to meet and love her. That's why he tells the story, so his kids can take away how important all the little things are. Ted sees his endless banging of chicks as a warning, showing his kids how sad and desperate he was and how he needed to go through all that, all the shit, so he could be ready. If the story ends with Robin, the only take away is that if you're patient enough you get what you want, which, granted, could be argued is just as a good of a story since it shows determination and acceptance, but saying that Tracy's story is null and void isn't fair and is very narrow minded of you to say.  I don't like Robin as a character, I think she's selfish and only thought of herself, realizing how much she needed Ted after it was too late. I like the alt ending because it showed her as successful, but lonely, which I think she truly deserved. I like the whole recap part, I've always said that the series starts with Robin because that was Ted's wake up call, not because she was the one. I like the alt because it's realistic, yeah sure people die of cancer and other diseases every day, but you don't mourn their loss by telling their kids how many other people you banged and how you never actually stopped loving their aunt. The story he tells makes more sense as a warning, a story about how hard life can be but you should always move forward because in the end, it'll all be worth it. The original ending doesn't do that.  The two endings have both good and bad, like everything. Saying one is better than the other is fine, it's your opinion. Saying one is pointless compared to the other however, that's just not fair.  Edit; *I know I just said it's not fair to call something pointless after saying the original ending makes the in-between pointless but what I meant is that the original ending makes everything between season 2 and 9 just filler content, not necessarily pointless, just doesn't give it as much meaning as the alt ending. Sorry if this is really long and preachy, I just kinda wrote down my thoughts and went with it.."

HIMYM,2y332w,Ericws,-3,Fri Mar 6 13:25:25 2015 UTC,"Thank fuck someone agrees with me.  The mother HAD to die, the story would be weird and a little creepy if she didnt. The entire show was built around the fact that she was dead and Ted was reliving their story to his kids  But Robin...gah"
HIMYM,2y332w,BenjaminFGates,4,Fri Mar 6 13:58:04 2015 UTC,"Why? I think the ending makes total sense. If the mother was dead and Ted had to move on, and Robin was available, then getting back with her would be the best thing to do.  It would've been even sadder if it just ended with her death and Ted remained lonely and sad for the rest of his life."
HIMYM,2y332w,anubis2051,1 point,Fri Mar 6 12:17:30 2015 UTC,"True,  And why the finale would have worked better for the viewers if a couple of additional minutes had been there to address the loss of Tracy and Ted's having mourned her for 6 years.    Now, I know Time Travelers and Vesuvius, and even HYMMM, provide that when you look at the entire 'work"" of the series as a whole, but I still say just a minute longer, with a shot of the funeral, or a moment of ""tender"" dialogue with the daughter, may have sufficed...."

I mean, I can't blame them them. If I lived above a bar that was somehow almost never too full or too loud, I'd spend my life down there."

Robin living in Brooklyn and working odd production schedules wouldn't allow that. When you get closer to thirty, you'll find yourself going out a lot less.  Barney is probably out every night picking up girls and drinking is a side effect of that (let's say 10-15 stiff drinks a week. 4-6 on a heavy night). Ted, Marshall, and Lily probably 3 nights a week but one of those is probably just a happy hour or a drink with dinner and they occasionally have a beer on the couch (I'll guess 5-6 a week for the guys and maybe 4 for Lily. Marshall goes on benders from time to time so occasionally 10 I'm a night). Robin swills scotch and enjoys wine but likely just had a drink one she gets home (almost identical numbers to Barney"

Intentional or not, that pilot episode of HIMYM, where Robyn was declared /not/ the mother was a huge relief for viewers who were tired of the whole thing.  This is part of why the ending of HIMYM was such a betrayal.

HIMYM,2xur8y,rajinto,87,Wed Mar 4 20:06:56 2015 UTC,For me it was Barney getting rejected by robin when she chose Kevin over him. I felt his pain man. TV show or not it still hurt

HIMYM,2xur8y,gagsy92,3,Wed Mar 4 12:41:39 2015 UTC,I completely agree!
HIMYM,2xur8y,ArtSchnurple,3,Wed Mar 4 12:56:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly! I use this episode to illustrate to people how brilliant the writing is. They make you so incredibly happy with Ted and Robin getting together, them SLAM you the hell down with Marshall.  Side note: They did basically the same thing again with Marshall's dad. Finding out his sperm is okay and they'll be able to have kids then BAM! God I love this show."
HIMYM,2xur8y,teamfrictionKEVIN,2,Thu Mar 5 00:53:45 2015 UTC,These moments made HIMYM so special and great.
HIMYM,2xur8y,ArtSchnurple,18,Thu Mar 5 02:04:47 2015 UTC,"They planned this out so great because you could guess that she was going to leave but because Ted and Robin's story was getting so hyped and everyone was getting happy and caught up in it, it took your mind away from it and then it hits you with the result rather than showing you how it panned out. It would be like if you were having the greatest day in your entire life and then some news like a family member suddenly passing away (like Marshall's dad), it hits you a lot harder."
HIMYM,2xur8y,teamfrictionKEVIN,2,Wed Mar 4 13:42:29 2015 UTC,Yeah it definitely felt like they lifted us up just to crush us.  Almost to make it hurt more.  I know they had a plan for the series but it feels like they enjoyed playing with the fans.
HIMYM,2xur8y,godbottle,28,Wed Mar 4 14:03:43 2015 UTC,Best use of music in any tv show ever.
HIMYM,2xur8y,ArtSchnurple,8,Wed Mar 4 02:36:52 2015 UTC,I can hardly listen to that bloc party song without thinking of this scene and getting emotional.
HIMYM,2xur8y,godbottle,13,Wed Mar 4 14:31:50 2015 UTC,"I'm like that with a lot of the songs used in the show.  ""The Funeral"" by Band of Horses, ""Simple Song"" by the Shins, ""Sea Green, See Blue"" by Jaymay, from the season 2 finale... The songs elevate the show to another level, and the show adds another layer of feeling to the songs.  If the rest of the show was as consistently good as the use of music, it would easily be the best show ever on tv."
HIMYM,2xur8y,ArtSchnurple,5,Wed Mar 4 14:36:15 2015 UTC,Agreed. 'The Funeral' always got to me even before that episode.
HIMYM,2xur8y,MrZarq,3,Wed Mar 4 14:49:41 2015 UTC,"That Jaymay song is so perfect for ending that season 2 finale. I've listened to it so many times over the past few years. To be honest, I've found a lot of my favorite music from this show. I think it's in the episode where Ted uses the service to find his ""perfect match"" in season 1 where they use a Ted Leo song.  Somewhere else I believe there's a Damien Jurado song, used, probably in the middle seasons."
HIMYM,2xur8y,ArtSchnurple,2,Wed Mar 4 19:34:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've found a ton of great music through this show too.  Around finale time I made a playlist/mixtape of songs from the show, and it was a really impressive mix of music.  Besides the ones I mentioned above, there was ""Careful"" by Michelle Featherstone (gorgeous song), ""Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp"" by George Harrison, the Proclaimers of course, ""Glad Girls"" by Guided By Voices, Vampire Weekend's ""Oxford Comma""... It's a total rollercoaster listening to it straight through, by turns melancholy, inspiring, and fun, and damn near every song is a keeper."
HIMYM,2xur8y,MrZarq,1 point,Wed Mar 4 20:00:17 2015 UTC,"Shit when do they use a Guided by Voices song?? I found them not from this show, but from The IT Crowd, in which there's an episode that uses the track ""Game of Pricks"".  Love that band"
HIMYM,2xur8y,ArtSchnurple,1 point,Wed Mar 4 22:46:30 2015 UTC,"It's in the fantasy sequence where Ted goes around hugging everyone on the street because, kids, if it weren't for that moment, I never would have met your mother.  It's such an exhuberant, joyful song that it fits the scene perfectly."
HIMYM,2xur8y,MrZarq,7,Wed Mar 4 22:54:19 2015 UTC,Completely agree!
HIMYM,2xur8y,freeze123901,2,Wed Mar 4 02:55:52 2015 UTC,What song is it? The dvd has some generic music because there was an issue with the music rights.
HIMYM,2xur8y,AlWinchester,5,Wed Mar 4 14:49:43 2015 UTC,"""This Modern Love"" by Bloc Party. I think the scene is on youtube if you wanna see how it plays with it.    That thing about the music on the DVDs really bothers me.  I haven't bought any of the DVDs for precisely that reason, but even beyond my own self-interest, I think it's a damn shame that in a format designed to preserve the show for posterity, one of the best things about it is absent.  Music licensing these days is a total train wreck, with the result that a lot of good art is being preserved in incomplete and inadequate ways. This is far from the only show that's happened with."
HIMYM,2xur8y,soup2soup,3,Wed Mar 4 14:59:09 2015 UTC,"It's only the first season (which is also in 4:3 aspect ratio), the rest have the correct music (and aspect ratio). It bothers me too."
HIMYM,2xur8y,doctorpotterholmes,2,Wed Mar 4 15:00:38 2015 UTC,"No way!  That is very good news, thanks for the info!  I've been not buying the DVDs all these years for no reason.    Was the first season actually broadcast in 4:3, maybe?  A lot of people still had square TVs a decade ago..."
HIMYM,2xur8y,pxan,2,Wed Mar 4 15:04:21 2015 UTC,"I think it was all broadcast in widescreen, but I'm not sure. All forum posts about the issue say they were. IMDB says all of HIMYM was broadcast in 1.78, but the individual episodes list 4:3 for a lot of episodes (at least until season 3, I stopped checking there). Amazon also pretends the season 2 DVD was 4:3, but I'm certain that one was 1.78. Very confusing.  I had hoped they would fix it for the Blu Ray release, but it doesn't seem like such a release will even happen."

HIMYM,2xjl8p,ekraz11,10,Sun Mar 1 07:34:36 2015 UTC,"The alternate ending was just a cop out and was not planned like that. I am pretty sure that they recorded the narration from Bob Saget after they realized how badly the finale was received by most of the fans. That being said, I didn't really like either of the endings. I wanted a happy end, I wanted Barney and Robin to stay together. My main problem is how they did S9 and the finale. They stretched the wedding weekend over a whole season and then spent only 40 minutes on the next 16 years. Considering how many filler episodes S9 had I can't understand why they did this. Why didn't they put the wedding as the S8 finale, Ted and Tracy meet and we have a whole fucking season where we can see their lifes in detail. I know that Ted had 6 years to grief over Tracys death, but we only got like a few minutes to process that, and bam he's after Robin again. At least put in a funeral scene, or a scene where Ted says goodbye to her, just like Tracy did with Max. I think I would've been fine with the real ending if they did it this way, and not so rushed."

HIMYM,2xduwo,rose_tattoo,4,Mon Mar 2 02:09:51 2015 UTC,"In Bachelor Party Barney ignores Marshall's request for a normal bachelor party and instead interferes with Ted's plan and ruins the party. The reason this annoys me so much is because it's the beginning of a really annoying trend on the show. Barney lies/does something selfish/irresponsible and instead of admitting his mistake and learning from it they add in some ridiculous plot twist that gives Barney what he wants (in this case to be best man. Or co-best man) and makes him the hero. (In this case, with Marshall justifiably upset with his ruined bachelor party, he questions why he's even friends with Barney and in the end it's revealed Barney is the whole reason Lily came back from San Francisco.) Give me a break.  The way Lily acted in How Lily Stole Christmas. I understand someone calling you a ""grinch"" can be upsetting but Lily wasn't being very fair about it either. Everything worked out in the end so that's fine but I just hated that she was willing to ruin Christmas for everyone because of something Ted had said over 6 months ago.  Lily making Marshall feel guilty about him wanting to sell her clothes to pay for their slanted floor in their new place in Everything Must Go. (guyforceshiswifetodressinagarbagebagforthenextthreeyears.com? Seriously?) She didn't tell Marshall about her shopping addiction all the times when she should have. Then another time for her to take responsibility presents itself and she tries to make Marshall feel guilty for suggesting it. So of course they put in some plot contrivance that lets her keep her clothes and not have to accept the consequences of her actions. Yes what Marshall said was a little insensitive when Lily suggested selling her paintings but he never actually said she was a bad painter or that he didn't believe in her. He was just being realistic. The way Lily reacted afterward was immature.  The way they closed the Ted/Stella relationship with that Wedding Bride movie. Ted got screwed over and was extremely cool about the whole situation throughout most of it, even saving Stella and Tony's relationship when he could have just as easily destroyed it. Yet when they wrapped up that storyline he got screwed over again by the portrayal of him in the movie. And then everyone turns out liking the movie, even his friends. Not satisfying at all.  Robin floating away in Sunrise. I get that the idea was to show that Ted had finally moved on and let her go but they didn't have to have him literally let her go The kids reactions to the end of Ted’s story in Last Forever. Too unemotional. Barney and Robin getting a divorce in Last Forever. This didn't bother me because I liked them together (I didn't). It bothered me because they spent 3 seasons teasing this wedding, making us wonder who the bride was. When it was finally revealed to be Robin they spend another season building up to the proposal and then when he proposed they spent the final season focusing solely around the wedding only to divorce them in one episode. It was just too rushed. I wish they had spent only 3 or 4 episodes around the wedding and then the rest of the season building up to the moments that they crammed into the finale.  Lily making Ted feel guilty about him wanting her to take better care of herself while she was pregnant in The Stinson Missile Crisis. On it's own, this probably wouldn't bother me that much. This is one of the many times Ted starts in the right and then loses his moral high ground by acting like a lunatic. It's this, in addition to her making people change the way they tell stories in Field Trip so that the baby doesn't hear the foul language. Really? It's okay to eat sushi and drink wine but if someone says a bad word...Around a fetus...That's crossing the line? Manipulative ghost Lily in Unpause Robin's pathetic schoolgirl crush on Barney in Lobster Crawl.  Judy and Mickey sleeping together in  The Over-Correction. The entire situation just grossed me out."

HIMYM,2xahgu,NiftyMist,2,Thu Feb 26 23:37:12 2015 UTC,"My guess would be that the characters, especially Ted, learned over time to take messages quickly. Five interesting friends who are almost always together, of which three shift through romantic encounters, like to keep up with each other because of course everyone wants to be the first to know something or not miss out on what's about to happen. I know Robin got some calls for her job and took them, which is reasonable because she was always struggling to grab advancement opportunities. Ted wants his relationships to go perfectly, so I expect there to be some obsession over fate in his calls. Also in that respect, it's clear that everyone knows that the others are meant to be in their lives and that they're great for dealing with emergency situations (most of the time). I think it's that connection aspect that just gives the show the warm, friendly feeling."

HIMYM,2x0cy5,OnceUponaTry,10,Wed Feb 25 04:44:44 2015 UTC,"As a character I have to say Nora. There was something about Nora that made me think of her as a character on the show , and not just a crazy plot line for Barney. I don;t know if it was the writing or some of the acting choices both performers made, but I thought Nora was a better Character. That being said I totally loved the whole Barney -Quinn Dynamic and I think Barney ended up with the best woman for him .. the next woman ( self internet five) N.I.A.B. #stinsonOUT"
HIMYM,2x0cy5,Starburstnova,5,Wed Feb 25 00:31:34 2015 UTC,"That's interesting because I think the opposite. To me, Nora seemed like she was only a plot device that didn't mesh with anything else in the show. Quinn on the other hand had the right sensibilities and humor that made her fit right in. Plus, she just seemed like she could actually tame Barney because she had the right personality."
HIMYM,2x0cy5,nicko68,7,Wed Feb 25 03:41:34 2015 UTC,Quinn was perfect for him.  Didn't seem contrived like Robin.
HIMYM,2x0cy5,Fairylin01,6,Wed Feb 25 00:21:38 2015 UTC,"Quinn was perfect for him -  he should have ended up with her.  After a while every barney & Robin story was him trying to win her back / Her trying to justify marrying him.  No fun,  no chemistry -  so boring.  This is probably why they broke up so soon."
HIMYM,2x0cy5,AlphaBenson,2,Wed Feb 25 00:55:43 2015 UTC,"I felt like Barney and Robin did have chemistry throughout the show (which, ironically enough, is seen more while they were not together, like when Barney told her that he loved her tough demeanor), but as you've said, it got really boring when every episode became Robin thinking: ""Do I love Barney???!!""  It really annoys me how Robin and Barney seem to be perfect for each other, but as soon as they're together, the writers have to make up some convoluted, often out of character or lacking any logical sense, reason to split them up. Likely to make sure that Robin and Ted end up together at the end.  Like, their first break up was really poorly done. Barney decides to ""settle down"", and alter his lifestyle since now he has Robin? This is completely out of character, since in later relationships, Barney struggled to change his comfortable lifestyle to accommodate a serious relationship. There's a whole episode dedicated to this Barney overcoming this when he was dating Quinn! Yet in his first relationship with Robin, he does it at the drop of a hat, apparently."
HIMYM,2x0cy5,Starburstnova,6,Fri Feb 27 05:53:13 2015 UTC,"I definitely preferred Quinn. I didn't really like Nora. Everything about her character seemed out of place on the show, and I just could not see them together whatsoever. Don't get me wrong, she was nice and sweet...she just didn't really seem to fit."

HIMYM,2x0cy5,bisteot,1 point,Sat Feb 28 03:14:03 2015 UTC,"I preferred Quinn. She was more open minded and loyal, a better fit for Barney, in a relationship both could grow up.  Honestly, I hate Robin by the end of the series. She is one of the most selfish characters I have ever seen on a TV show. She only care about herself, her job, her problems. It was never about what she could bring to a relationship, it was about what could her partner bring to her.   That is why she ends with Ted in the first place, and why she ends with Barney. And when she can't have something is when she finally decides she want it. She deserved to be left alone."

In S7E18 Ted also finds out that Lily and Marshall hate living in the suburbs and gives them the apartment. At this point they probably just ""gave"" the house to Mickey because he had no other place to stay. In S8E3 we then learn that Mickey blew up the garage which caused the house to burn down."

HIMYM,2wrjzy,jelatinman,6,Sun Feb 22 15:23:42 2015 UTC,"No can-do's-ville, baby doll.   Doesn't this episode confirm that not only is Tony a jerk, but Stella is an even worse person for confiding details that only she would have known, such as the two-minute date? Film-nerd grievances: if The Wedding Bride became the fifth-highest grossing movie of all time at the time it was released (May 2010) with how little time it seemed to be out when Robin mentioned that (2-3 weeks), the movie would have been the fastest-growing movie of all-time. Funny how aside from a couple of sequels the movie is almost never mentioned again, unlike our Inception's and Titanic's. Maybe it's like Avatar where it was a short-lived but enormous success that was utterly forgettable and did little for American cinema. ""They got everything right! Even the part with the nunchuks!"" Yes, that is Judy Greer as Royce. This role is a bit weird for me to see her in because of how different it is compared to her other roles. She's a very capable actress, so for her to be the beautiful bimbo of the week is strange. Coupling that she's more conventionally pretty than TV-pretty makes it weirder. Maybe it's because she's closer to Josh Radnor's age when all the other bimbos are in their 20s?   I found it funny how it perfectly spoofed every romantic comedy that the show unabashedly loves. Chris Kattan is always nice to see too. This episode could have used more Barney. While it's mostly a filler episode, this is the one that Ted finally uses to try to truly move on from the pain of Stella. He eventually starts dating long-term again in season 6."
HIMYM,2wrjzy,TMWNN,2,Sun Feb 22 18:48:34 2015 UTC,"Coupling that she's more conventionally pretty than TV-pretty makes it weirder. Maybe it's because she's closer to Josh Radnor's age when all the other bimbos are in their 20s?   I agree that Greer, as lovely as she is, is an atypical choice for Ted's Girl of the Week.TM That said, it's reasonable to believe that Stella is as old as Ted (born in 1978), if not older, given her medical practice, Lucy's age, and Tony's apparent age.  On an age continuum of Ted's women with Carly and the Arizona Tech student in ""Three Days of Snow"" on the youngest end, Stella is probably at the other end with Royce and, relative to Ted's age, Natalie from ""Return of the Shirt"" and Karen nearby. Overall, though, during the show, Ted ages eight years before meeting the Mother while his women stay the same age."
HIMYM,2wt4t3,whoami4546,10,Sun Feb 22 23:04:06 2015 UTC,I loved Robin all the up til about season 8. It started with her yelling at Patrice which I just found really annoying. Then in Season 9 when she was fighting with her mother in law the day before the wedding was not funny it was just painful.  Finally she just continued to be independent to the point where she only cared for herself
HIMYM,2wt4t3,ZDHELIX,3,Sun Feb 22 23:37:25 2015 UTC,I liked everyone.
HIMYM,2wt4t3,rhcp88,2,Sun Feb 22 23:14:50 2015 UTC,"Lily was an absolutely horrible person. I don't blame Alyson, it was just the way she was written. I think anybody didn't hate Lily is just blind. She was the most meddlesome, selfish, high and mighty person I have ever seen in any TV show ever. She's messed with Ted's life so many times, but she always thinks that she took the high road and did the right thing. Perfect example of lily's horribleness: S9E19. Robin isn't freaking out over her wedding day. She's playing hockey with her sister and having a fun time. Lily thinks Robin is wrong for not freaking out (already an idiotic concept) and makes Robin looks through photo albums with her while she cries. Robin doesn't like touchy feely crap. Any friend worth a bag of rocks could figure that out. But lily didn't care about what Robin wanted, she only cared about what she wanted. So when Robin wanted to go back to not doing touchy feely crap, LILY PUTS ON A FUCKING WEDDING DRESS AND TELLS ROBIN SHE'S GONNA WEAR IT TO THE WEDDING. Seriously, that is such a bitch move. And for anybody who says ""oh she's just trying to get her to admit she cares about the wedding"" go fuck yourself. What does lily always say? It's the brides day. Whatever the bride wants goes. Always choose the bride. But she is purposely trying to sabotage her ""friend's"" wedding and trying to make her freak out? What kind of best friend would purposely try to freak out the bride on her wedding day and make her stressed. ANOTHER EXAMPLE: S9E2. Lily destroys Ted and Marshall's incredibly expensive bottle of scotch and then tries to cover it up like nothing ever happened. But when marshall and Ted do the SAME EXACT THING, instead of coming clean, she fucking punishes them. She makes her vikings fan husband wear a cheese hat. If my wife made me wear a Cowboys jersey I would divorce that bitch so fast her head would spin. Instead of coming clean like a normal person and saying ""it's ok, were even,"" she embarrasses them for nothing more than her own amusement. And then when Ted and Marshall find out what she did, she doesn't even hint at an apology, she doesn't even give a shit. Because she's a bitch. And I use these example because they are some of the weakest possible examples yet they still describe her perfectly. They're so small, yet they give you an idea If you look at San Fran, the credit card debt, the bashing of Marshall and his corporate job, the purposely sabotaging Ted's happiness to win a bet, the purposely sabotaging Ted's happiness because she couldn't sit on a porch with those girls, the stolen ball, the Rome trip, the stealing fucking christmas because Ted told marshall a 100% true fact about her being a bitch, the Spain incident, and the list goes on. She is the biggest bitch in television history. And don't give me this bullshit about how the show is fictional, subreddit who rioted online about the ending of the show. For 9 seasons, the goal of the writers was to connect you with Ted. These people get payed all the money they do and get the time slots they got because they are so good at sucking you in and making you connect with Ted on a level deeper than ""just another TV character.""  We identified with this guy, we watched him change and we went through relationships and felt feelings of sadness and happiness with him. She just pissed me off, almost to the point where I stopped watching because her character was written so horribly. sorry for the rant.   TL;DR - Lily is the worst character ever on TV"

Ted is hesitant to go that night, but he keeps the tradition even when others are too busy, and eventually when he meets the mother.  Darby Stanchfield plays Marissa Heller. She is best known for her role as Abby Whelan on Scandal. Fun thing to notice on rewatches: a character named Jefferson Van Smoot. This last name would later be used for recurring character George ""The Captain"" Van Smoot from season 6 to the end of the series. I presume the former to be The Captain's father.  Is Mexican wrestler Ted a reference to Josh Radnor's resemblance to a Mexican goalie in the professional football leagues?

It keeps it simple, though I'm sure there are a million different examples of them wearing a million different colors.  Another thing to consider is that Lilly often had red(ish) hair, so doubling down on red outfits too often would have been overkill. So they put her in blue."

HIMYM,2wbzjy,Domyfranky,126,Wed Feb 18 17:49:44 2015 UTC,"This has been said a few times, but I feel really strongly about this:  The problem wasn't in whether or not the finale was understandable, it was in the way they threw it all together way too fast.  After having to suffer through almost an entire final season that almost felt like it was made up entirely of filler episodes, the finale made us have to deal with so much in the span of 21 minutes.  There wasn't nearly enough time for anyone to deal with all of the HUGE life events that they put the characters we grew to love through.  They belittled Ted and Tracy's entire relationship into the space between two commercial breaks, and didn't leave enough time for the audience to experience each emotion as it was occurring before they wedged in a new, enormously emotional plot development.  All this made the finale a roller coaster of emotions that the pace of the show didn't allow us to even feel.  They had so much material that they could have extended the finale (and people would still have watched the shit out of it, maybe even more so) to an hour or two and still have kept us captivated through every damn minute of it.  TL;DR: why the FUCK wasn't the finale at least a two-hour special?"
HIMYM,2wbzjy,FrostySack,30,Wed Feb 18 19:41:08 2015 UTC,"| TL;DR: why the FUCK wasn't the finale at least a two-hour special?  Exactly. If they had 2 hrs it probably would have alleviated most of their pacing problems and been an extremely memorable/well received finale.  Practically it's bc of the way TV show slots are organized (packaged and negotiated at start of contract) and also b/c of the show. Basically the show was structured from Ep 1 to meeting on the platform, with anything shown after as an epilogue/bridge towards the last few minutes. So they had to backload all the information on us.  Problem is if they split up any of that information early (like Robin/Barney divorcing) they'd give away the ending weeks in advance. If you checked out this subreddit at all during S9 a lot of people thought Tracy had passed away and Ted winds up with Robin, but the main argument was that she was still getting married. So if we knew any earlier that she gets a divorce it would have given away the ending for sure"
HIMYM,2wbzjy,aversion25,2,Wed Feb 18 23:39:33 2015 UTC,"That's a good point.  I don't know what strings they would have had to pull, and other shows would have gotten bumped (and what would the world have done without a new episode of Two Broke Girls???), but they could have put everything that they put into the finale and just extended it with dialogue or jokes.  That would have given the audience time to process all the emotional shit they put us through."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,FrostySack,1 point,Thu Feb 19 05:14:06 2015 UTC,"Yea definitely. I mean after a freaking 9 season run I would have wished they had enough strings to pull the 2 hr finale, but I guess not. Who knows if they even tried to fight for it or were blatantly told no.   I'm at ease with it b/c we got the lunch scene atleast in the deleted scenes (which imo was really important). And we all can imagine what the funeral/death/grieving was like on Ted's side since they covered that in the show with how other characters handled problems.   So even if the execution was poor atleast the structure of how the story should have went is laid out clear enough to fill in the blanks"

HIMYM,2wbzjy,Rerichael,189,Wed Feb 18 18:22:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly this.  Understand doesn't mean liked it.  I understand why they ended the way they did but the way they went about it was a train wreck. Spent the entire season on the wedding, which at first seemed like a horrible idea but then it actually got pretty decent as the season continued, but then after 20+ episodes of the wedding, they rushed the final episode. By the time it got to the end, you could only scratch your head and say, ""Okay?"""
HIMYM,2wbzjy,Beeslo,170,Wed Feb 18 19:17:01 2015 UTC,"exactly. My biggest issue isn't the plot line of the finale, but rather the pacing of the whole season. To spend so much time on the wedding was fine, except to then rush the failure of the marriage just made it disproportionate.  If they had done half the season on the wedding, and the second half letting us see Ted & Tracy together, let us see Robin & Barney fall apart, let us see Tracey get sick and pass away, then I think I would have been more ok with it."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,Drim498,16,Wed Feb 18 20:59:08 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't understand you being down voted, I think that sounds like it could have worked; perhaps not half a season of Ted and Tracy maybe two or three episodes, though I agree with your principle of spending more time on it. 6-7 months of episodic build up to the worlds shortest wedding, culminating in one joyous scene of only a few minutes between ted and tracy and then to have it all crash and burn over the next 5 minutes and have Ted outside robins apartment with the blue French horn again was just too many emotions to have in such a short burst, I couldn't appreciate any of them. Given how shallow a lot of the season was in comparison to the other 8 I couldn't help but feel the series could have used the substance of the ending in a much better way. As other people have already stated, I understand it but that doesn't mean I have to like it."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,xerker,29,Wed Feb 18 21:24:21 2015 UTC,"Still, sounds a lot like reality to me.   Have you been through the ""best friends wedding"" scenario? Two people from your social circle get married to each other. The wedding is a huge freaking deal to all involved parties, more so if they have a core group of friends in common. But almost inevitably, everything changes after the wedding, and the biggest change is that the group as a whole lose touch with each other.   It's an unfortunate reality that the series very effectively portrayed. We share in the other characters' shock at the divorce. We share in their sense of disappointment and their lack of closure.   I've said before and I'll keep eating downvotes for saying it: the finale was perfect because it so closely mirrored the reality of life for the intended audience.   I'm essentially squarely within the target audience of the show; a single male who turned 30 and graduated law school while the show was airing. The gang and I grew up together. We both went through our series of disappointments. And through that, Ted gave me hope: knowing that whatever crap he dealt with, the mother was still just around the corner. In the finale, I shared Ted's reality check, along with Barney's. Life isn't perfect. Happy endings are never the epilogue.    Yes, the series could have ended on the train platform. In my opinion, the remainder of the finale beyond that point really was epilogue. Perhaps it would have been better, from an entertainment perspective, to have just left it off for the DVD extras. But including it just converted the fantasy into reality, bringing the series home to be completely, devastatingly relatable."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,NotRoryWilliams,15,Wed Feb 18 22:08:30 2015 UTC,"But in reality Ted and the other characters got to slowly get to know Tracy, spending time with her over a course of years.  We didn't get that.  I never cared about the relationship that the show revolved around.  They could have given us a season of the mother being part of the gang and then took her.  That would have been more in line with what the characters experienced.  I'm ok with the story, but hate the way it was told during the final season and don't feel it accurately portrayed how the characters felt.  Less focus on the Robin/barney wedding and more on the group dynamic involving the mother.  Robin and barney still marry and divorce, the mother still dies and Ted still ends up with Robin, but the viewer has more of an even relationship with the characters."

I'm ok with the story being exactly the same but I felt ripped off by not getting to experience this relationship that was built up for 9 years."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,Scapone22,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:04:14 2015 UTC,"Of course Ted is going to gloss over it. He's telling the story to his kids. They probably already know how she died, and they don't want to hear about it again. Ted also is still getting over it, so it's going to make sense that he won't actually address it.  The finale isn't about the ""build up"" to the relationship. It's about enjoying the moment while you still have it."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,joezn,5,Thu Feb 26 12:49:35 2015 UTC,"See, again, it wasn't the plot. Yeah, divorce, death, are part of life. And maybe the reality check and shock of the divorce were fine. But she didn't get sick and die in a week. We don't know what killed her, but we know they had enough time for them to do things, like visit the B&B where the wedding was/they met.  I think the rushed divorce of Barney and Robin wasn't the thing that surprised/upset me the most. It was the rushing of the mother's death. To spend 5 min on something that was obviously important and that they had months to deal with, we should have had at least a few episodes to deal with it too."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,Drim498,2,Thu Feb 19 01:03:16 2015 UTC,"The entire show was told from Ted's pov. He was telling a story to his kids, who knew the details about how she died and probably the stories about them living together before that. We weren't told those things because Ted wouldn't have told them during the story. What he was telling then was how they met. After he hit that point, he skipped thrift the rest of it quickly just to reiterate some of the later events without going into a ton of detail, because those events weren't as important to the story he was telling. If he was telling them how their mother got sick and died, we would probably have more info.   TL;DR: We didn't get that info because it wasn't relevant to the story we were being told."

People of that age really do believe that all of the awesome new friends they make in college will be their best buds forever and ever no matter what, their new girlfriend is 100% ""the one"", and that death only ever happens to other people."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,TMWNN,3,Mon Feb 23 18:40:26 2015 UTC,Said the exact same thing in an earlier thread today. The pacing was just god awful. There was so much filler that could have been cut out.
HIMYM,2wbzjy,Semper-Fido,1 point,Thu Feb 19 05:11:01 2015 UTC,"and the second half letting us see Ted & Tracy together, let us see Robin & Barney fall apart, let us see Tracey get sick and pass away   Pacing requirements are why having a season, or a large part of a season, of episodes that each depict a moment in the ""future"" wouldn't work for HIMYM.  In a full modern sitcom episode you need   an opening (whether cold or not) an A-plot a B-plot jokes based on running gags built up over recent episodes plot resolutions possibly a bumper ending with a separate joke   All of these depend, to varying degrees, on 1) context established over previous episodes or 2) exposition within the episode itself. An episode set in March 2020 can't depend on those cues being established in the previous episode, set in June 2018, so has to have exposition stuffed into the 22 available minutes. The result feels artificial and forced, because it is.  No, the only way for a sitcom to depict random out-of-context moments is to do exactly what HIMYM did from the first episode of the first season: Brief flashbacks and flashforwards that work regardless of context (and often better without it)."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,TMWNN,14,Mon Feb 23 18:38:28 2015 UTC,"With you on that. I get it, i wasn't surprised, I see the overall picture of what the Craig and Carter were trying to effectuate.   That doesn't mean that, after 9 years of watching Ted redundantly falling for Robin, I wasn't going to be disappointed by it."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,balic66,48,Wed Feb 18 19:31:10 2015 UTC,Same here. The big issue here - and with the Dexter finale - had more to do with AWFUL FUCKING EXECUTION.
HIMYM,2wbzjy,ITSABARE,9,Wed Feb 18 19:07:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I always liked Ted and Robin together, but at the very least they should've included the fucking lunch scene and Tracy's funeral. We needed some kind of transition and closure as viewers."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,InheritTheWind,1 point,Wed Feb 18 22:56:35 2015 UTC,The Dexter finale is just awful no matter how you look at it
HIMYM,2wbzjy,Dustin65,-13,Thu Feb 19 08:33:29 2015 UTC,I don't agree
HIMYM,2wbzjy,morphinapg,13,Wed Feb 18 19:09:47 2015 UTC,Well to clarify I mean execution of Season 9 as a whole.
HIMYM,2wbzjy,ITSABARE,-12,Wed Feb 18 19:12:41 2015 UTC,I really liked season 9 as it is
HIMYM,2wbzjy,morphinapg,12,Wed Feb 18 19:26:49 2015 UTC,"Me too, I thought it was excellent until we find out what actually happened to Barney and Robin. Then the whole season feels pointless. If you take it without the second half of the finale I would consider it one of HIMYM's greats"
HIMYM,2wbzjy,TheCrushSoda,-13,Wed Feb 18 19:49:46 2015 UTC,I think it was a great plan personally.
HIMYM,2wbzjy,morphinapg,2,Wed Feb 18 19:51:53 2015 UTC,"I agree and I'm sorry to see that this has become a place where you get down voted for having a different opinion. Sometimes people put a lot of time, money, and fuss into a wedding and then get divorced fairly quickly. I thought it made sense considering the characters and actually kind of liked that it didn't end up story book, and happily ever after."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,WhatABeautifulMess,3,Thu Feb 19 03:58:22 2015 UTC,I think it maybe that hes giving next to no input. Its okay to have an unpopular opinion about something but the responses are childlike and add absolutely nothing to the conversation that you are clearly trying to have.
HIMYM,2wbzjy,Hayreybell,-2,Thu Feb 19 04:46:35 2015 UTC,I have people who follow me on reddit who could be spoiled if they saw my comments on my profile. I'm trying to be vague with my responses on purpose.

HIMYM,2wbzjy,theunnoanprojec,9,Thu Feb 19 08:59:20 2015 UTC,"As soon as Ted's daughter said it at the end of the show, it all made sense.  The story was never about the mother.  The story was always about Robin.  Even if you don't like the ending, that's how the story ended."

After seeing everything altogether and being able to connect the dots, it made a hell of a lot more sense.  Still sad tho. And I think I'm mostly just upset because they're fucking right.. Life doesn't always end up perfect like in the movies. Reality can happen."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,what_a_cat_astrophe,1 point,Thu Feb 19 00:12:05 2015 UTC,"And that more than anything else is why I liked it.  I agree they could have executed it better, spending a little less time on the wedding and a little more time on the years between that and 2030. At the very least they could have given us something more about Tracy's death than ""it's been 6 years since she died"".  I do have a theory as to why they did it that way though...  The whole show is from teds perspective, obviously. So from teds perspective the weekend of Barney and robins wedding would have seemed like it lasted a looooong time.therefore we as the viewers saw it lasting a loooong time.   By the time Ted got near the end, he realized that he had to end the story soon, and actually get down to asking the kids if they're ok with him dating robin. Therefore he began to through in as much random info from the intervening year as he could so that he could stall for time."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,theunnoanprojec,98,Thu Feb 19 09:03:36 2015 UTC,"After I watched the first episode and you find out Robin is not the mother, I wanted a situation where the mother would be out of the picture so he could end up with Robin.   200 episodes later I just didn't feel that way any longer.  I wanted Tracy to have a happy ending with Ted.     Be careful what you wish for."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,chaos9001,11,Wed Feb 18 19:23:07 2015 UTC,"I felt like the writing was done in a way that they made sure everyone had a happy ending, and that really bothered me. It's not like everyone has to end up happy. Robin had countless chances to create that happy ending with Ted throughout the series, and she blew it. Her ending up unhappy and alone would have been a perfectly acceptable finish, and one I would have been a lot more satisfied with."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,trolledbytech,3,Thu Feb 19 03:37:02 2015 UTC,"Well said. I've always had the opinion that while I didn't necessarily mind Barney and Robin divorcing (although I was a bit bummed since an entire season revolved around them), and while the mother's death sucked, I could live with it, I never thought Ted and Robin should've ended up together. It was poor writing in my opinion. I understand why it was done, but just because I understand doesn't mean it was well done."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,dashn64,0,Thu Feb 19 06:42:22 2015 UTC,Except for the fact that this is a fictional sitcom. A comedy show about not real people.  In comedy people end up happy in the end. The people who are entirely written and made up by the creators for the purposes of comedy
HIMYM,2wbzjy,theunnoanprojec,6,Thu Feb 19 09:12:08 2015 UTC,You did it?
HIMYM,2wbzjy,gacman47,19,Thu Feb 19 03:35:46 2015 UTC,"Watched every HIMYM when it came out. I understood the finale.   I think what've could been done better is not limit everything after the wedding to just one hour-long episode. I think if you took three episodes away from the wedding lead-up and had four episodes dedicated to what happened after the wedding, it would've given breath to the major events in the finale.   For example, one episode about Robin and Barney breaking up, one about Barney becoming a father, one about the mother finding out she's sick, and finale about her dying and the realization about Robin by Ted."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,manmythmustache,7,Wed Feb 18 19:39:58 2015 UTC,"Problem with that is the ending would be 100% given away and the finale would be completely lackluster. A lot of people thought Tracy was dying after the Time Travelers speech and Ted crying in Vesuvius. If we find out that Robin gets a divorce 4 episodes before the finale it confirms the ending.  It's all over the internet, and a bunch of people predict in. Then during the death scenes everyone will be complaining that they can't believe Tracy is being killed off for Ted/Robin to wind up together.  By the time the finale actually airs (exactly how it was predicted) it'd be pretty bad imo. And I don't think the scenario I listed is unrealistic or exaggerated."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,aversion25,3,Wed Feb 18 23:48:40 2015 UTC,"As much as I feel like it shouldn't matter that people would guess the ending if it were done that way, to tv execs it would. You're right. Artistically, it would've been the way to go, but commercially, the way they did it was the right way."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,The_Puzzle_Maker,20,Thu Feb 19 02:46:11 2015 UTC,"You mean ""stuck with it"" through the myriad times when Ted discovered that Robin wasn't right for him? When his divorced parents revealed that their relationship was doomed from the start pretty much for the same reasons that Ted and Robin's was? Or when she floated away like a balloon? Or when Barney became a better person throughout the series? Because that was a part of it too and did a lot to diminish my understanding of none of it actually mattering in the end. I would have ""understood"" it better if it had been three seasons earlier."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,WalterSkinnerFBI,9,Wed Feb 18 20:51:31 2015 UTC,"I felt so bad for Robin as a character. It made her feel so shallow -- she spent so much of the entire series turning down Ted's advances, and then she marries+divorces Barney and then, what, ends up so jealous of Ted's wife that she can't stand to be part of the friend group anymore?"
HIMYM,2wbzjy,idkmybffyossarian,3,Thu Feb 19 05:49:33 2015 UTC,"Or when Barney became a better person throughout the series?   My point exactly too. Even till the Season 8 finale, I was never sold on him and Robin as a couple. He was still a liar, and she was still too distrusting. But Season 9 spanning over their wedding changed the deal for me. We see them compromise and work out all the issues that culminate in Barney's oath of honesty and Robin's consequent trust in him. And we learn that they never strayed from that - their two major issues apparently never became a problem in their married life, and instead some never-seen-before hastily-explained issue becomes reason for their divorce. Talk about a pointless build-up."

Ted never ""discovered"" that. They broke up because Robin freaked out when she thought Ted was proposing, and he realized that she still didn't want the marriage and kids he wanted for them. Conversely, after he decided he could forego those things, he made his quasi-proposal in ""The Drunk Train""."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,TMWNN,35,Mon Feb 23 18:45:44 2015 UTC,"They just threw out all the character progression. Like the last couple of seasons didn't even need to happen it felt like.  I don't care if Tracy died. That's fine. I just wish more story had been put into her instead of rushing it.  Also Barney and Robin's divorce was the stupidest thing I've ever seen. Why spend a whole season on it, and then have them divorce on the 1st episode of the next season? I wouldn't have been mad if it was like two episodes, but seriously, it was a whole season.  The ending was probably one of the worst out of any TV show I've watched, because it felt like the previous seasons didn't even exist. It's like they took the first 2 seasons and were like ""Yup, there's our ending!""."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,Ruari999,9,Wed Feb 18 18:52:25 2015 UTC,"Imo the wedding was the framework for the last weekend the entire gang was together. That's the focus point, and that's what was highlighted in the show. It's where Marshall + Lily found out they were having a daughter/renewed their vows/officially moved to Rome for a year. It's where Barney + Robin committed to getting married. It's where Ted was at his lowest, yet met his wife. It's where Tracy met the gang.  A lot of significant events happened that weekend which is why it had so much focus. Just because it's Barney + Robin's wedding doesn't mean their relationship should overshadow all the other stuff that happened"
HIMYM,2wbzjy,aversion25,2,Wed Feb 18 23:36:18 2015 UTC,Must have an utterly knackering weekend.
HIMYM,2wbzjy,IAmNoShakespeare,23,Thu Feb 19 14:44:46 2015 UTC,"For me, it wasn't even about the finale. It was the final season and how they set it up and stretched 48 hours into however many episodes (a stupid decision, in my opinion), and then had Barney and Robin break up super early in the episode. It was like a big ""fuck you"" to viewers."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,ImperfectSanity,6,Wed Feb 18 18:31:28 2015 UTC,"This! They wasted a season showing how perfect Barney and Robin were going to be, gave us no time with the mother, then rushed everything into the finale.  Why they didn't take the season to explore why Barney and Robin dissolved, Robin falling out of the group, Lily and Marshall's future escapades with the kids, and Ted and Tracy building a life together, etc. is absolutely beyond me."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,sedusa_su,3,Thu Feb 19 00:26:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said. Hell, the first five episodes could've been about the wedding and the rest of the season be about what happens after and I would've enjoyed that immensely.   I think they've (the writers, their names escape me at the moment) responded to this criticism which boiled down to ""Well the show is called 'How I Met Your Mother'"". Which is bullshit because at this point, the show had evolved into so much more."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,ImperfectSanity,114,Thu Feb 19 01:34:43 2015 UTC,"Ending made sense if the show had ended in S2 or S3.   Unfortunately after 9 seasons the last few minutes was terrible and didn't make sense.  Honestly I don't think him and Robin would have been as upsetting if  it was a flash forward placed earlier in the finale, but there was no reason for him and Robin to end the finale instead of the first time Ted and Tracy met."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,srad1292,39,Wed Feb 18 18:24:50 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. I would have been totally cool with it at the end of season 2. It was great writing in where we were for season 2.   The thing is, the show organically grew on it's own into something different. The characters grew into something different than they were in season 2. The ending didn't make sense in that context. Problem is the creators were adamant about trying to write around that original ending plan that they were blind to the fact that it just didn't work nine years later.  We've seen that they like to play these writing games like with ""Now We're Even"". This one just came back and bit them pretty hard.  I also don't like the ""But it's realistic!!"" argument. Real life isn't just tragedy."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,Shirubaa,13,Wed Feb 18 18:47:00 2015 UTC,"Also, HIMYM is not a very realistic show. Marshall singlehandedly saves the earth from his position as a state judge, and Tracy writes a book about economics that solves poverty for good."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,marymelodic,13,Wed Feb 18 20:45:16 2015 UTC,"I feel like they didn't actually do all of that, but that Ted kind of exaggerated their accomplishments to make them seem more important."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,ShadicNanaya510,4,Thu Feb 19 00:35:52 2015 UTC,"real life isn't just tragedy   Neither is the show.  Marshall and lily had a long happy marriage with several children.  Barney got to have the joy of raising a father  Robin got to see the world  Ted got to spend nearly a quarter of his life with a woman who he loved, and was able to fulfil his dreams of raising kids, not to mention he was in his ideal job.  And even though Robins marriage ended and Ted lost his love, the two of them (presumably) still were able to find happiness in their later years with each other after living lives they chose and fulfilling their own goals which they set for themselves."

I suppose in the greek sense if one looked at the whole series, it would be a comedy in that the characters all wind up in the same state they started in, but looking at just this episode, it begins with all of the main characters being perfectly happy with how things have turned out and no conflicts in need of resolution, and then horrible things happen to 3/5ths of the cast, which is colloquially considered tragedy."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,EulersPhi,2,Wed Feb 18 20:55:14 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, Barney finds his life's purpose in his child; Robin is finally a successful news anchor and winds up with the man she saw herself ending up with many times throughout her life; and Ted is able to happily spend ~11 years with the new love of his life and, after grieving her death for 6 years, end up with the old love of his life. Might not be the picture perfect ending when you throw in the divorce and the death, but it's certainly not all tragedy."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,Joeleus,6,Thu Feb 19 07:47:05 2015 UTC,On the other hand barneys entire character development over 9 seasons was negated for no real reason.

HIMYM,2wbzjy,srad1292,9,Thu Feb 19 00:16:17 2015 UTC,"That was their plan in case the show got cancelled after a couple of seasons.  It wasn't the ""point"" of the show, it was just a tacked on ending that they couldn't allow themselves to see past and see what the show had developed into."

I'm also not upset that he got back with robin (ok, maybe a little upset). I'm upset that those 2 things which are HUGE got pretty much glossed over. Also that they spent and entire season on an event that lasted a weekend and then sped through 10 years.   So in short. I'm not upset at the story, I'm upset with the story telling."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,do_not_ask_my_name,14,Wed Feb 18 19:23:45 2015 UTC,"There's also the tone. They go from glossing over Tracy's death and - giving the audience no time to grieve for a character they made the audience fall in love with - straight to a wildly unfunny sequence where they try to drag humour out of Ted's daughter telling us the story was ""entirely"" about Ted wanting to bone Robin and how cool she is with it and gosh darn it's funny how Ted thinks it's a big deal.  You're professionals, Bays/Thomas. You make your living on this shit. You should not need me to tell you: you can't do that."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,aversion25,0,Wed Feb 18 22:13:39 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of that came down to editing. They filmed ~75 minutes worth of material and condensed it to 40. They're professionals who were forced to put an ending that needed 1-1.5 hrs to be fully fleshed out into 40 minutes.  Which is probably why Radnor thinks the show will age better than it was received. The ending fits the story as a whole and is cohesive, but the sudden tonal shift/information being dropped surprised viewers."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,do_not_ask_my_name,8,Wed Feb 18 23:45:31 2015 UTC,"But it's not like they lacked time. They had a luxury that most shows never get - an ENTIRE FRIGGIN' SEASON to wrap up. Don't tell me Marshall's slap education or Barney's schemes to make his parents bang or Ted not receiving a thank-you note or a useless road trip partner or the theft of a curly-fry deserves more screentime than seeing Barney and Robin starting married life happily, but soon struggling with issues, eventually making the hard but inevitable decision for a divorce, Tracy spending more time with Ted, dealing with her sickness, having Robin help the family out, Ted mourning his wife, Robin taking care of the kids and finally the two developing secret romantic feelings for each other again.  They made a choice, and they chose... poorly."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,aversion25,0,Thu Feb 19 11:35:28 2015 UTC,"Imo there's two way of looking at it. One is thinking they spent the entire season inefficiently and wasted time on silly stuff. They could have fleshed out all the future stuff better. That's probably what the majority think.  The other is to see the show as ep 1-->train platform, with all the flash forwards + future stuff being an epilogue of sorts that leads you to the last scene. It's intentionally left vague and done quickly to give you a taste, but not it's ultimately not the focal point of the story (just like any epilogue from a book). It gives you closure on the characters.  I personally like the second one better because the story is backloaded - it all built up to his meeting with Tracy/the ending. They couldn't spread a lot of that info any sooner into the series. A lot of people suspected Tracy was dead after Time Travelers/Vesuvius, and the only roadblock there was Robin getting married.   If we saw the divorce ~4-5 episodes sooner, then we'd know Tracy was dying. And the minute we saw her die it would cheapen everything b/c everyone would be exploding about how shes only dying so Ted can wind up with Robin. And in the finale when he does wind up with her - the entire internet/forums/critics had all called it. The finale would be received even worse."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,do_not_ask_my_name,2,Thu Feb 19 16:01:45 2015 UTC,"Leaving things to the imagination is one thing, rushing too fast is another. They could have still introduced Tracy's illness and the couple struggling through it early enough. Same goes for Barney and Robin struggling through marriage. Fans would have still debated if ""it would happen or not."" If they wanted to really give ""surprise reveals"", they could have still left the outcome of Tracy's survival/the marriage to the last episode.  Anyway, the end reveal was still not really a reveal, it was still expected. Just that they glossed over major issues."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,aversion25,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:08:09 2015 UTC,I agree the pacing was off. I guess why I never got that upset is because they gave us all the info we needed with the deleted scenes + what they aired. The story is complete and cohesive - we can fill in the blanks for whatever is missing.  It was jarring to see them suddenly shift tones throughout the finale and there was a lot of info to take in for one episode. But hopefully it will age better as that same shock wont be there for anyone who rewatches it
HIMYM,2wbzjy,idomoodou2,2,Thu Feb 19 16:18:39 2015 UTC,"hopefully it will age better   Hopefully. But it cracks me up that the finale one-year anniversary is coming up next month, yet we see discussion posts here everyday."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,aversion25,-1,Thu Feb 19 16:21:41 2015 UTC,"Picture it as a book - start point is that first scene where he sits kids down, and end point is Ted meeting Tracy on the platform. All the flash forwards and everything else we got is essentially an epilogue which gives us a taste of how everything turned out, but not the entire picture.  Imo that makes it easier to digest/understand why those scenes were shown so quickly, as opposed to it being huge stuff glossed over and inefficient screen time. They aren't the focal point of the story, but complimentary info to give readers/viewers a sense of closure"
HIMYM,2wbzjy,Patron_St_of_Liars,5,Wed Feb 18 23:42:48 2015 UTC,"But that is not the end. The end is him telling the story. There's a better way to tell the exact same story, probably with the same footage, but this way was not the way to do it.   I'm sure there is someone out there who can re cut the finale to give off a better told episode."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,Holovoid,-1,Wed Feb 18 23:51:55 2015 UTC,"That comes to the other constraint - they had 1 hr to show the finale, and 20/60 min had to be commercials. They filmed ~75 minutes and cut out huge chunks to make the time allotment.   Probably adding in the ~5 min lunch scene where Robin admits she was wrong and gets rejected by Ted and fleshing out Tracy's death/funeral/aftermath for ~10 min probably would have been enough to make the finale much better received.   The tone shift wouldn't have been so dramatic (from Tracy dying to kids cracking jokes at Ted), and we would have finally seen Robin pining for Ted."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,S3atbelt,-6,Wed Feb 18 23:57:51 2015 UTC,"And I think you're in the minority of haters. If all the dissenting opinions were like yours this would be a very different discussion. But they're not, unfortunately."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,WalterSkinnerFBI,28,Wed Feb 18 21:10:44 2015 UTC,"I mean, I understood the finale. I get what Josh is saying, and I liked the finale to an extent. My issue is really about Ted going back to Robin, because he ultimately decided they were too incompatible. It felt like a step too far back for Ted, and it also hurt the character progression of Robin and Barney to get married and then split up.  Truth be told I would be fine with the finale if they had killed the mother and had Ted go back and start looking for ""The Next One"" instead of going back to Robin. But Josh does understand the show and character, probably more so than any of us, so I feel like if he's satisfied with the ending then I can be as well."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,aversion25,12,Wed Feb 18 18:27:33 2015 UTC,"Ted and robin aren't incompatible. When they were together in season 2 they were a great couple, but they wanted different things out of life.  Ted wanted to raise kids and robin wanted to be a famous and successful journalist. Both of them got what they wanted out of life, and Ted was ready to get back out there and find happiness. It only makes sense that he goes to the girl he had been after for such a long time especially considering that they were both at great times in their life to be together."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,WalterSkinnerFBI,17,Wed Feb 18 19:48:17 2015 UTC,"Even in that framework...  T: ""Well, the love of my life is dead and I have these great kids.""  R: ""Well, I travelled and am famous, but I'm divorced and barren.""  T&R: ""Heeeey, fallback!""   Relapse high-five!  It still doesn't seem romantic or a pursuit of happiness. It seems like a hollow chase of something that used to be."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,aversion25,10,Wed Feb 18 20:54:24 2015 UTC,"I think it makes much more sense when you factor in their age. It's not to 20 year olds relapsing - it's 2 50 year olds with ~25 years of history together (friends, not friends, lovers, etc). That experience is enormous, and is a solid foundation to be happy with someone and love them.  Almost any chase would seem hollow after the love of your life dies - who is actually going to replace Tracy romantically? Tracy will always be the love of Ted's life, but who he's with will be the one he loves now. He doesn't have to be resigned and die alone.  What I got from their themes is that love isn't all about ""the one"" or big romantic gestures or being perfect. Ted was in love with several people throughout the series who could have been ""the one"" if the timing/chemistry/circumstances were right."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,WalterSkinnerFBI,3,Wed Feb 18 23:32:31 2015 UTC,"A story like this is about the importance of the journey, and they negated many aspects of that journey through the events of the finale."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,aversion25,0,Fri Feb 20 14:44:31 2015 UTC,They didn't negate anything with the finale - we just got darker timelines. The journey of them growing up/maturing throughout the years is still very much there.   What do you think is invalidated?
HIMYM,2wbzjy,metalbracelet,2,Fri Feb 20 17:08:15 2015 UTC,Several seasons worth of growth.
HIMYM,2wbzjy,ZadocPaet,-1,Fri Feb 20 17:21:34 2015 UTC,"Not really. You only have to accept a few things for it not to invalidate growth.   The womanizer who freaked out about his wedding several times, kept constantly ""retiring"" from a playboy lifestyle he loved, and lied to keep his relationship smooth up until the alter wasn't able to make it work.   The workaholic who spent years and years striving to advance in her career (including moving to a new country, working at 4am/other ridiculous hours) finally achieves the success she always wanted and puts it first.    Ted realizes there is no such thing as the one (even Tracy had two loves). Tracy is the love of his life, but there have always been women Ted loved ""right now"". Ted ends up settling for Robin bc he has a vast history with her and they're in their 50s (where you look for companionship and chemistry, not fresh new love).  HIMYM was full of shallow changes and things that seemed one way but were another. Classic example of this is S2 when Marshall promises to stop being sad about Lily and go back to normal the next day, and narrator Ted steps in and says 'but he didn't, because life doesn't work that way'.   Just because you say something or promise something or deny something doesn't make any of that true. They've used that device several times throughout the series."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,bananashammock,2,Fri Feb 20 17:29:05 2015 UTC,"I agree. I was thinking about how this was sort of like the Dawson's Creek finale, and spoiler.

The finale will not age well, to summarize (because I'm not ranting again) the finale was a slap in the face because it did not take into account the length of the series and the growth of the characters. If the series had ended after the 1st-4th season then sticking with the finale would have been fine. But the growth of Barney, Ted, and Robin was undermined,"

HIMYM,2wbzjy,XL_Miro,7,Thu Feb 19 06:32:51 2015 UTC,"Not understanding and not liking are two very different things.  Why didn't I like it?  I didn't like it because when they first introduced the mother - I didn't like her. But they made it so you did - so you fell in love with her too.   The episode with her really hit the feels for me, because when I was young, I lost my boyfriend in a car accident on Thanksgiving morning. Some who have not dealt with that personal loss may have found some of her quirks to be very strange. The talking to objects, and the sky, and feeling like she didn't deserve love again.  I had a Lewis - the first guy after my loss, who I felt I should love, but couldn't. No logical reason for why I ended that relationship, at the time.   They went through all the work to paint her character. To make you fall in love with her. To make you see a little of yourself in her.  Then they just George RR Martin'ed that shit.   It's not because young people don't know how to deal with death. It's because death was presented in a way that seemed like a group of alcoholics created the storyline using post it notes without coherent thoughts connecting any of them.   I think death was dealt with and discussed rather beautifully when Marshall's dad died. I still tear up every single time I see that episode.  I'm not upset by the idea of death. I'm upset by the way the show cheapened it."
HIMYM,2wbzjy,Ericws,7,Wed Feb 18 22:24:39 2015 UTC,"I call shenanigans.  It should be: ""People who stuck with the series understood this was the finale that was written in case the show ended after season two""."

HIMYM,2wbzjy,tosswe44,2,Wed Feb 18 22:00:25 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more... HIMYM is not my favorite show, but a great show that is written very well and connects with it's audience as well as anything I've ever seen. The ending was not how we wanted it to end, but in reality, that is how things go. That is why the ending was amazing to me. Although the show is titled ""How I Met Your Mother"" it is a story of friends,their lives together, and finding love. To give a character that is in the show for about 10% of the series a main role and be the ending would just not be right. She was the mother and now we met her. Closure has been made from the name of the show. But what we REALLY enjoyed watching was the everyday hilarity and tragedy that was the show. The mother was just a plot tool to work towards that keeps us satisfied"

Instead of having the very lengthy, all season wedding, have it to where the last 3-4 episodes (dependent on the detail they would want to go) were about after the meeting with the Mother. More detail into the Mother's death. More detail into Barney and Robin's breakup. More detail and fun after the wedding. There were a few filler episodes that didn't need to be there in Season 9, and they could have taken those out and extended the finale a bit.  Everything after the wedding wrapped up into an hour was not enough time. It felt rushed and not cared about quite as much, compared to the rest of the show's history."

HIMYM,2wbn6z,TMWNN,3,Wed Feb 18 16:35:58 2015 UTC,"I wish the HIMYM finale didn't suck   Speak for yourself. I have never missed an episode of How I Met Your Mother since the night the first episode aired in autumn 2005, and enjoyed the ride start to finish. From the first episode on, the show prepares itself and viewers for the finale.  When people say ""the finale sucked"", they really mean ""there wasn't enough fan service and not everyone ended up exactly where fans daydreamed them to"". Life doesn't work that way and there is no reason to expect TV shows to, either.  (And, no, Barney never had any ""growth"" in the show to be ""taken away in the finale"". Only those who weren't paying attention think that 1) Barney ever had any ""growth"" other than, perhaps, coming to love his daughter (but, again, that occurred in the finale), or 2) there was ever any hope that his marriage to Robin would work out. The show relentlessly depicts from S3 on how the two are completely unsuited for each other despite physical passion, and all of S8 and S9 might as well be subtitled ""this marriage is competely doomed"".)"
HIMYM,2wbn6z,Bartimus_Prine,13,Wed Feb 18 19:18:39 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ. Get off your goddamn high horse. Every time this topic comes up some asshole comes in talking about how those of us who didn't like the finale are idiots who only wanted fan service, who can't appreciate how the ending was ""real"" (it was no more real than what many wanted for the finale anyway (and while HIMYM had moments of reality, the show was not very realistic throughout its run making a ""real"" ending out of place as well)) who just aren't old enough and don't understand, etc. it never ends, and it's always an attack on those who didn't like the ending instead of actually defending the ending. This leads me to believe that you either a) are just a contrarian asshole, b) think you are above the rest of the fans or c) you will just take whatever is put in front of you with no regard to whether or not it is shit.  Also, if the show shows us how Barney and Robin aren't meant to be together, that's fine, but it's shows and blatantly tells us time and time again that Ted and Robin aren't meant to be together either, in fact, outside of the series finale, almost the entirety of the show (maybe not the 2nd Season) is about how Ted and Robin shouldn't be together, and aren't going to be together. And of course you missed the point of the criticism about Barney and Robin splitting up 15 minutes into the finale. It's not that they split up, it's that we had to waste an entire season at their wedding only to have it all undone in 15 minutes of the next episode for bullshit reasons.  Additionally, the fact that you think Barney never grew as a character makes me think you weren't paying any real attention."
HIMYM,2wbn6z,darwin2500,13,Wed Feb 18 19:27:23 2015 UTC,"The series doesn't show us that Ted and Robin shouldn't be together. It shows us that Robin can never be 'The One' for Ted, and therefore, Ted rejects her and looks for other options.   In the finale, it's revealed that Ted has realized that his idealistic fixation on 'The One' was in fact juvenile and counter-productive, preventing him from appreciating the amazing things in his life and sabotaging his otherwise good relationships (that's why the story of 'How I Met Your Mother' doesn't involve the mother, he's teaching his kids to appreciate life by showing all the amazing things that happened to him before he met The One, and how his fixation on The One made him disengage and not appreciate it all enough at the time).  That's why he ends up going to Robin - she can't be 'The One', but she can make him very happy right now and they can have a much better life together than if they are both sitting alone in their homes, depressively mourning the absence/loss of 'The One' in their lives.  There, I've actually defended the ending and told you what it means and why it is appropriate to the message of the show.  What's your response?"

Good detail I never caught before: the mugger and the zookeeper are the same actor. Now this further confuses me on if Marshall got mugged by a monkey.  Barney once again displays his amazing gift of lying until if goes too far. He notes that the lie is far more interesting than the truth, and thus should stay true.    Despite not being that funny, it did bring up an interesting point about the series as a whole: how much of the story is really true/exaggerated? I believe just about every event happened, barring a few exceptions, but some of the stuff could be exaggerated, like Robin's toughness or Barney's obsession with girls. Interesting stuff to think about."

I concede that love is blind and anything is possible and I don't know with 100% certainty that Ted and Robin wouldn't work.  However, have you ever dated someone that you know that no matter what happens in the future, it would never work out?  No matter how much your heart wanted them, you knew it wouldn't work.  Maybe a bad boy or girl that you wanted when you were young and then grew older to think what was I thinking. Not that these people or robin are bad, but just not for ted.  Ted = family man, romantic, would do anything in the world for a friend or lover (locket, rain dance, etc. Robin = didn't want kids (Before she found out she couldn't have them), career woman, comes and goes as she pleases, into and out of the group when her career allows her to and she gets lonely, etc.  This couple just wouldn't work.  Also, people do change a lot, but not that much from their 30's or 40's on... hence, why dating at this age is more difficult because people are more stuck in their ways.  I just compare it to maybe a super strong republican and super strong democrat, trying to make things work. One is not necessarily better than the other, but their views on life are so different, that it is next to impossible to make it work."

But as far as my favorite episode for the entire series goes, I'd have to pick How Your Mother Met Me. The reason is because its the most we saw the mother in the entire show. Also, her playing La Vie En Rose makes me choke up every time."

Introduces the running gag of Barney (almost) never taking a bad picture. Hes like Superman, where if doing plays is his main superpower, then taking a good photo is his heat vision. Features the return of Natalie, last seen in Return of the Shirt.  Also Karen reappears, finally giving context to what Marshall and Lily's Paris trip was really like with Ted.    Overall nice bottle episode, but does demonstrate a problem with this season: Ted dates way too many random skanks and does not really get back to longer lasting relationships until season 6."

I always thought that Robin had a way of giving guys ""outs,"" such as when she and Kevin finally broke up, and she'd pretty much talked him into it. Same with Ted, and Barney. The one time she ever picked a guy for entirely selfish reasons (not to say she doesn't do other selfish things at other times) was when she picked Kevin. Kevin's response to ""why to you like me"" was far better than Barney's ""because you're almost as messed up as I am,"" which is anything but complimentary.

Same with Ted,    Ted and Kevin were different, they both wanted families. Robin wasn't going to let either one of them sacrifice that. That's why she made sure that Kevin knew that she didn't want kids, either by adopting or surrogacy, if he stayed with her then kids were out of the equation. The same with Ted, when he told her that he could look past Robin not being able to have children because he loves her, she told him she didn't love him. Barney came across as a whiny, needy man child who needed Robin to entertain him all the time. He couldn't or wouldn't support Robins career even though he didn't seem to have any job while they were married   dit: sorry if this rambles a bit, can you tell I'm tired? :P   You make more sense than alot of people"

She does okay with what she's given, but it's odd that she's treated like she's known for years but is only in this episode. I found that problem with The Blitz later on.  Filmed in front of a live studio audience... Which has the drawback that the only flashback type element is inside Barney's fantasy. It plays more like a conventional sitcom.  Accidentally proposing to Henrietta? Really? The teacup pig came at a time when the fad was considerably on its way out, so using the ""it was 2010, it can be justified"" thing does not work. Got a callback in season 9's ""Sunrise,"" though.  First appearance of Scooter, played by Neil Patrick Harris' real husband, David Burtka.    This episode showed what I believe to be the legitimate friend zone. Not ""I'm not attracted to you but please I like you. Let's be friends."" This girl blatantly manipulates Ted into being her backup and stringing him along, then takes advantage of all the perks of a relationship. And it is an uncomfortable truth that everybody has done this at least once because they were afraid of confronting their lack of feelings for somebody."

In response to the question, and some of the comments...here we go, he starts describing his ideal woman, and says that she can ""quote obscure lines from ghostbusters."" and to be honest, the line ""Ray if some one asks you if you're a ghost you say yes!"" isn't an obscure ghostbuster reference at all. Anyway, in terms of the Annie Hall thing, he gets hung up on one episode, or maybe a couple episodes, especially the one about Facebooking girls instead of actually getting to know them. He gets bent out of shape when girls don't enjoy Annie Hall while talking something about Woody Allen....plus Marshall says during the Stella era (i think) that Star Wars is Ted's favorite movie."

HIMYM,2vnxn0,tpowpoww,16,Thu Feb 12 16:31:21 2015 UTC,"Ted and Robin would have stayed together had they both wanted kids and Robin wasn't so career focused. After both achieving their side of it (Ted has kids, Robin has travelled the world for her job), there's nothing in the way of the two. It makes perfect sense.   Edit: and to add, yes it's a little insensitive to ignore the mother in this, but she died what five-ten years before the final scene? Are we to believe that our hero Ted who holds love and destiny close to his heart, is just going to say ""Welp my wife's dead, I guess I'll live the rest of my life and die alone."""
HIMYM,2vnxn0,Cferra,6,Thu Feb 12 17:52:52 2015 UTC,"This is why the diner scene was so pivotal. Time and distance can make the heart grow fonder - this happened with Robin - she realized that Ted actually moved on and that sparks feelings - which is why she left during the Halloween party and why she avoided the group - later on after reconnecting with Ted on a random day she felt the need to take a opportunity to basicly lay out her realization on the table but Ted being happy didn't reciprocate. After Tracy's death it was ok for robin to reconnect with Ted helping him through the grief he felt from the loss of his wife and for Ted to reconnect with his feelings that he shut off for Robin and that's why he tells the story and that's why the kids gave their blessing and why Ted then goes back to robins apartment with the grand gesture that started the whole tale.   You are right though, nothing is set in stone, it's just the beginning of a new story."

The indications are that Robin would have wanted a permanent relationship with Ted given the diner scene and her bitterness she expressed to Lilly when Lilly and Marshal were moving out of their apartment.  Also, clearly Robin had been a good friend to Ted and his children after Tracy died.  With that said, hard to teach an old dog new tricks, and Robin was not one to ever settle down completely.

HIMYM,2vnxn0,mikeabbo,4,Sun Feb 15 13:59:06 2015 UTC,"I think during the series Ted was looking for true love and robin wasn't. Ted found and lost his true love in tracy.  At the end of the show ted isn't looking for true love anymore, he isn't trying to replace Tracy, he is on his own. He is looking for companionship in someone who he once had a great connection with.  While robin may have changed, growing a greater aprociation for Ted (call it love or not), or even of she is the same as she was it doesn't matter. What matters is without the weight of the idea of it being true love or the idea of marriage and kids, Ted and robin could grow old together and they could be happy together on the front porch with marchal and lily.  Tldr: At that point in teds life he is just looking to be happy not for true love. Robin means happiness and companionship for him."
HIMYM,2vnxn0,starmapleleaf,2,Fri Feb 13 01:06:30 2015 UTC,"Firstly, in the alternate end they don't get back together because Tracy is alive and kicking still.   I agree with the rest to an extent. She only got herself to admit her feelings for Ted and consider acting on them when he was taken.   1) Robin only admitted her feelings truly after seeing Ted and Victoria. Yes she kissed Ted before, and broke up with Derek, but she hadn't truly admitted it and she put her career before the very important date.  2) Robin admits her feeling again for Ted when he's just about to marry Stella, or so he thinks. She had how many opportunities before?   3) Robin refuses to admit her feeling in Season 7 in The Drunk Train when Ted is very available  4) Robin's will to run away with Ted was more pre wedding jitters and she didn't truly mean it as she loved Barney then   5) Robin admits Ted was the guy she should have ended up with when he's very happy with a pregnant Tracy to Lily  I think she's moved past that though. Or at least I hope she did."
HIMYM,2vnxn0,rose_tattoo,2,Sun Feb 15 20:31:14 2015 UTC,There is nothing set in stone that any of them will be alive in 2031 either  It hasn't been all of a sudden  Why does Robin go to Teds reguarly for dinner?  Why is it obvious to Penny what is going on between Ted and Robin when she does come over for dinner?  Penny has pretty much told us what's been going on
HIMYM,2vnxn0,Domyfranky,5,Fri Feb 13 05:15:00 2015 UTC,"I know i will be downvoted for saying this,but i think that,saying that Robin never loved Ted,you said the wrong. Robin showed feelings for Ted so many times:  -First 2 seasons (of course)  -Season 4: She told him to don't marry Stella,and she says that maybe her feelings are still there. Then we discover in season 8 that during that period she got drunk cause she was sad for Ted's wedding with Stella. Then their ""friends with benefits"" episode.  -Season 5: She almost kissed him  -Season 7: She kissed him twice,and then after she came back from Russia,she said ""no"" to him,but maybe it was because she knew that Ted always wanted kids,so i think she did the same thing she did with Kevin the episode before (episode 7x16). We don't know for sure,of course,but i think it's possibile.  -Season 8: When Ted,in the episode 8x23,say to her ""We know what we really want,deep down"" she take his hand first...if Ted didn't ran off in that moment,what would have happened? We don't know,but Robin had so many doubts in that moment..i think she was thinking ""maybe i should be with Ted"".  -Season 9: She had that magic moment with Ted on the beach (episode 9x17) and then before the wedding,she realized that maybe she should marry Ted,so she ask him to run off with her,and only because Ted said ""no"" this didn't happened (like Carter Bays confirmed back in December on Twitter,she basically left Barney at the altar). So i think that actually we saw many signs trought the series that Robin had feelings for Ted too,she was scared by this and denied them,but they were always there."
HIMYM,2vnxn0,alligator___,1 point,Thu Feb 12 17:52:23 2015 UTC,I was bummed when Nora was out. She should be with Barney. And that leaves Robin for Ted. Or Tracy's character should be played by Nora. She is soooooo pretty to be just in a few episodes
HIMYM,2vjqw5,Domyfranky,124,Wed Feb 11 16:23:58 2015 UTC,"Then they should have made us still root for them (yes I know some people did but a lot of people did not). I was sick to death of Ted and Robin by the end. Scrap the Barney/Robin plot entirely, have Robin marry someone who isn't one of the lead characters, space things out a bit more (the finale stuff, no season long wedding!) and show Ted mourning Tracey before he asks his kids for their blessing to go after Robin and THEN I'd probably agree."
HIMYM,2vjqw5,BewilderedFingers,27,Wed Feb 11 20:11:17 2015 UTC,"Agree.  There are 3 specific stories that it betrayed :   the entire last season (why build up the wedding arc for an entire season and then throw it away at the end) ?  the barney arc - barney was revealed as a do good hippie who changes to take revenge upon the guys who stole his girlfriend. He did get his revenge, but now the change (womanizing, suit up etc) is shown to be a permanent and fundamental part of his character. Disappointing further because love for robin is supposed to have redeemed him.   The ted/mother arc - got over way too quickly. We might feel differently, if not for the entire last season and desire to compress the reveal into the finale."
HIMYM,2vjqw5,barath_s,3,Thu Feb 12 02:13:08 2015 UTC,"Barney was always about going on the rebound after having his heart crushed. It happened every single time. He just had a kid before finding the next person to settle down with.  Despite the joking about in the final season when Barney/Robin were to be wed, when Barney was committed to a relationship, he was committed."
HIMYM,2vjqw5,gizmo1492,6,Thu Feb 12 03:19:11 2015 UTC,"It felt like they really didn't know what to do with Barney after the divorce. I didn't even like his baby plot, NPH acted it well but it felt like lazy storywriting.   And I had gotten quite fond of the mother, I felt she deserved a better send off. HIMYM is still a TV show and we need to see stuff, not just be told ""oh yeah six years later now I am ready"". I heard there was a funeral scene, I'd love to see that."
HIMYM,2vjqw5,BewilderedFingers,3,Thu Feb 12 07:32:07 2015 UTC,"They didn't know what to do with Barney period.   His profession during his marriage was ""lifestyle blogger"".   He comes out of the entire run of HIMYM in much the same place as when we first met him, but without the cool factor, mystique, happiness, or yuppie career, even without as close a bro-ship/friendship in his old years.   This was disappointing because they laid the foundation for a much more intriguing Barney, who spent the first 20 years of his life with values etc, switching to ""suit up"" Barney in order to take revenge, accomplishing his revenge, and then just continuing on being the same ""suit up"" guy, except more tawdry and just sad, without the cool.   They showed Barney with Robin and the power of redeeming love, and then took away that too. Ultimately they show Barney just an extremely limited person.  In life, one may indeed have friends who are unhappy in their personal and professional life jumping through their personal relationships, but it kind of makes it just sad when it turns out to be one of the mainstays of the show. You'd never again be able to enjoy that character or the show so much again.  The baby plot  had no payoff. Just a throwaway line that she would be his life, without any particular significance for his own personal life, career, values, sacrifices that he would make for her or anything along those lines, growth on her part, redeeming story arc etc. So it just doesn't mean much. Just an afterthought/throwaway."

HIMYM,2vjqw5,BewilderedFingers,1 point,Fri Feb 13 12:22:44 2015 UTC,"I think others have explained it better than I could. They had spent seasons showing Barney's development, how he started off as this hippy and became the womaniser after his girlfriend cheated on him. Then they show him slowly learn that he does want to settle down eventually when he meets someone he really loves, he showed a lot of love for Robin but he also seemed to really care about Nora and Quinn too. They finally build up seasons into Robin and Barney getting married, he promises to always be honest to her (which is huge as lying is certainly somthing Barney does a lot) and then bam...divorce ten minutes into the final, done with that. After that he just regresses to womanising, and the writers needed some sort of closure for him since this was the finale...so it felt like they just pulled the baby thing out of their asses. It came out of nowhere, we never even saw the mother of this baby, and he is just instantly a changed man now despite not wanting the baby mere seconds before he saw her. I know mothers who didn't bond with their babies that quickly even after carrying and giving birth to them! It was all too ""convenient"", and it erases basically everything he'd learn about relationships. He didn't break up with Robin because he didn't feel right being married, it was because she put her work before their relationship. This ""I can't be tamed"" thing was a big step backwards from what we saw.   Barney having a baby could have been written better. If they didn't do Barney/Robin at all (I quite liked them together but would rather it didn't happen with the ending we got, I'd probably have rooted more for Ted and Robin without this entire plot), and instead expanded and further developed his relationships with Nora and Quinn to show the changes his character goes to, then perhaps the baby could have been an unplanned (and originally unwanted by Barney) pregnancy with one of them? It would feel much less like a deus ex machina."
HIMYM,2vjqw5,do_not_ask_my_name,2,Fri Feb 13 12:45:07 2015 UTC,"It felt like cheating to me - we're first told Barney changed due to Robin, then that he did NOT change, and then that he changed due to a baby with a hook-up. Why should I believe THIS now?"

HIMYM,2vjqw5,BewilderedFingers,3,Thu Feb 12 03:18:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe they were forced by CBS to focus on Barney and Robin (their relationship took highest ratings to the show,the last 3 seasons had the highest ratings of the entire series) we don't know for sure,maybe that's the reason why they focused on them so much."

I think I'd have liked the ending much more without that as I just felt like I'd been tricked and not in a good way. I don't see why it'd make fans happier to put Barney and Robin back together and split them up in the final, but it could have been purely about ratings which don't matter much after the show ends.

I know i'm in the minority,anyway.  Also,we have to say that during season 9 we also saw the weakness of Barney-Robin relationship (but not too much,sadly)."
HIMYM,2vjqw5,gizmo1492,18,Wed Feb 11 20:54:22 2015 UTC,"I always loved Ted and Robin   Why? I felt they had nothing in common and were an awful couple. They share almost no common interests, and Robin outright mocks most of Ted's interests. In fact, the only thing that kept them together was Ted pining after her. Ted was constantly doing things for Robin. What did Robin ever do for Ted? It also feels completely out of left field. Ted tries to get back together with Robin many times and gets shot down plenty. Robin never tries to get back together with Ted. Then, all of a sudden, Robin claims that Ted is ""the love of [her] life""? It just doesn't make sense.  Ted might have deserved Robin, but Robin never deserved Ted.   Also, if they knew Ted and Robin were going to end up together, they shouldn't have spent literally years establishing all the reasons Barney and Robin work better together just to shoot it down at the last second."

And Robin not wanting to marry is kinda null since by season 7 she is at a point where she's ready to take the next step, or so she thought. She even married Barney!"
HIMYM,2vjqw5,RusVir,5,Thu Feb 12 03:35:29 2015 UTC,Yeah but at that point we'd seen the show do everything in its power to convince us that Ted was over Robin.

HIMYM,2vjqw5,BewilderedFingers,2,Thu Feb 12 09:40:30 2015 UTC,"This. Being a network show, they probably didn't have full freedom to go about the story as they wanted. They were driven by ratings and had to cater to the viewership. Barney was the show's main selling point, he was center-stage in all the promos. So the later seasons kind of became all about him in order to keep the ratings going. Barney marrying Robin was not their original plan, they went with it because viewers loved their chemistry. Especially Season 9, I had heard that they had wanted to keep it short and just wrap up the story, but CBS demanded a full 24 episodes, hence the fillers."
HIMYM,2vjqw5,pineyfusion,0,Thu Feb 12 15:42:27 2015 UTC,I think I've seen some data that shows the last 3 seasons were actually the least popular.

HIMYM,2vjqw5,fco83,14,Thu Feb 12 07:23:33 2015 UTC,"I really liked Barney and Robin together but absolutely not the way that they wrote them. Barney/Robin was a potential goldmine that they just didn't know what to do with. And they put them together too early with Season 5. Sure they broke them up, but it was still really awful. I think Barney and Robin having an unconventional relationship where they just travel the world together and are that badassed couple who has an open relationship of sorts really suits them. Like they have permission to sleep with other people but they never do anyway. They wouldn't define their relationship because there was no point in that for them. That's the kind of couple I always envisioned them being and it pissed me off how they completely conventionalized them.  I'd still have been really pissed off with Ted and Robin even if this finale was after 4 seasons or so. I mean the finale would make a shitload more sense but I wouldn't be as ripshit over it as I was about this finale. I'd still be kind of mad because I watched the show initially BECAUSE of the fact that Robin wasn't The Mother. I loved the idea of Robin as The Almost Girl. The girl that was almost perfect for Ted but yet there were those things that didn't really come together. I liked that whole ""sometimes love isn't enough and that's okay"" message because it's a message that is true to life sometimes and is hardly ever explored."
HIMYM,2vjqw5,jackster1232002,41,Wed Feb 11 23:22:44 2015 UTC,"I don't really have a problem with the ending just how they went about getting there.  Spending the entire last season on Barney and Robin's wedding only to have them breakup in a 5 minute segment in the final episode made the whole thing feel pretty pointless.  Also, I think Ted and Robin ending up together would have felt more satisfying if the show had ended 3 or 4 seasons earlier."
HIMYM,2vjqw5,Fthefingsystem,6,Wed Feb 11 20:02:16 2015 UTC,"A comment about the finale I saw elsewhere (AVclub I think) and really agree with is this: a wedding weekend with all your closest friends is something that you'll remember every detail of for years, but falling out of a friendship with someone is a very gradual process, and I think the pacing of the show reflects that. Robin didn't just suddenly vanish and declare her friendship with the group over, it was just that over the years they saw less and less of her, and that kinda thing just kinda sneaks up on you, til one halloween you suddenly realize you're barely friends with that person anymore. But nostalgia will usually cause you to look back and see all the big, happy events as looming large, and to diminish the sadder events, which it would make total sense for Ted to do. Plus, many of his big events during this time were with Tracy and his kids, and they would already know all about that, so he has less reason to tell them"
HIMYM,2vjqw5,idomoodou2,9,Thu Feb 12 02:31:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, agreed on both points.   Ted and Robin wouldve been great a few seasons earlier before we basically went through more time and learned ""this is why these two will never really work together"".

HIMYM,2vjqw5,pineyfusion,5,Thu Feb 12 03:08:45 2015 UTC,"Going to be long but, I'll type it out.  Well Ross and Monica are brother/sister so that eliminated them.  Ross and Rachel was always the Ted/Robin of the show. Ross wanted her Season 1, but Rachel didn't want him until the end of the season. Then they end up dating, the infamous ""we were on a break"", and have an on/off thing for the remainder of the series similar to Ted/Robin. You just want to root for them, but they can never fully solve the relationship.  For Ross and Phoebe there was a flashback episode where Ross is drunk and crying, having them almost hook-up. But they keep bumping into stuff and gave a ""Just not meant to be"" vibe, with them even claiming that having sex wouldn't be the best solution.  Chandler and Monica eventually becomes the Lily/Marshal of the show. Before then, Monica and Chandler were typically so busy with other side characters that hooking up within the group was eliminated. Chandler/Janice and Monica/Richard were the main characters that stuck around, and even come back. Generally, the show kept them busy with relationships until it eventually landed them together. Therefore it eliminated any ""what if"" scenarios.  For Chandler and Phoebe/Rachel it was relatively easy because the show never really gave a vibe that there was any attraction. It's equivalent to Marshal talking to Robin or Ted talking to Lily.  For Joey and Monica, when they first met, Monica is attracted to him but he ends up doing the 'Naked Man'. Yes, Friends did it first haha. However, Monica isn't the 2/3 times and the attraction never really comes up until a drunken night where she is looking for sex. Instead of Joey she finds Chandler, and thats how that relationship begins. Again, preventing the Monica/Joey relationship.  Joey and Rachel was handled sort of like Ross/Phoebe, as a ""just not meant to be scenario"". They do try to date in the later seasons, but Rachel just slaps him anytime Joey tries to make a move because its wrong and weird since they've been friends for so long.  Lastly, Joey and Phoebe they do joke about eventually dating together but never actually do. In the last season when Phoebe gets married its finally justified that they have a father/daughter relationship. As in Joey is always looking out for her.  Woo, think thats everyone."
HIMYM,2vjqw5,Ashton42,2,Thu Feb 12 04:28:51 2015 UTC,"True, but it was Barney so introduced Ted to Robin. And that those two had other partners would be OK, but not Robin and Barney. But I guess it was inevitable."
HIMYM,2vjqw5,thegeekist,9,Wed Feb 11 21:09:52 2015 UTC,"Barney is hilarious but when you really think about it, he's a broken man. There's no way he can ""get married and live happily ever after"". It took a daughter, his own flesh and blood, to show there was someone out there for him. It's his instinct to be a better man than his father that will keep him on the straight and narrow with her. I don't think a wife is really a true interest of his, especially now with a kid."

Of course that changed him, I'm just saying he had potential for monogamy, and was not ""always like this.""  The other thing was, the wedding weekend went too far in justifying why the wedding should happen, leading to large character developments such as Barney's oath of honesty. And we found out he never strayed from that. If anything, Barney's philandering should have broken the marriage. Instead, it was a never-seen-before issue that was sprung to us suddenly.

HIMYM,2vjqw5,goldlion84,3,Thu Feb 12 03:24:40 2015 UTC,He is right. Even though Barney and Robin got more screen time they didn't develop their relationship at all. It was always played for laughs. There was never any depth to Barney and Robin.   Barney went from Nora to being engaged to Quinn to being engaged to Robin in less than 12 months. Season 9 proved that they would never last.  They should have left in the deleted scenes from Unpause with those guys. Barney wasn't happy just being with one woman

HIMYM,2vjqw5,reymysterioguy10,4,Thu Feb 12 02:53:30 2015 UTC,The ending is heavily misunderstood.   Ted and Robin definitely weren't meant to be together. They made that very clear multiple times throughout the series.   Remember the whole series is Ted telling a story. So he was aware of this. This was actually the point of his story. He was trying to tell his kids why he was afraid to get back with Robin.   Plus we had to sit through this awful scene all for nothing.   It wasn't for nothing. It was meant to show that Ted had genuinely moved on from Robin and didn't have feelings for her again until 2030.

HIMYM,2vji4h,jelatinman,6,Wed Feb 11 15:11:55 2015 UTC,"The big 100 is finally here!   This episode was huge progress to the story of meeting the Mother. We get an idea of what she's like (plays bass in a band, listens to Ted's music, read The World's End) and some of her quirks such as singing a Capella with an English muffin. Cindy may be the most important girlfriend in the whole series now watching this in hindsight, but we'll get to that. Or, if you have seen the whole series, Cindy eventually arranges the mother's band to play at the wedding.  Let's not kid ourselves, Barney is the B-plot despite him getting equal screen time. Albeit a very funny side plot. First appearance of Tim Gunn as Barney's tailor. Despite all of the famous guest stars the show accumulated over the years, Tim Gunn was the one the cast and crew were most excited about. Gunn would later recur throughout the rest of the series. This episode felt monumentous and not just because of revealing more clues about The Mother, but because of the increased budget allowing for a musical number. Neil Patrick Harris and Jason Segel kill it in the singing, and Josh Radnor and Cobie Smulders are decent enough. Alyson Hannigan... Well, let's hope she doesn't have to sing anymore.  ""He was Italian... Always had a way with the ladies.""  ""Oh you poor thing. How old was he?""  ""Seven."" Karina is played by WWE diva Stacy Keibler, and Cindy is played by The O.C.'s Rachel Bilson. Bilson currently stars in the CW's Hart of Dixie, which may get cancelled. Hot bartender Robin? More please.   Overall great episode that showed how funny the show can be when it wants to be goofy but still has a lot of heart. The only thing I find odd is Ted dating a student. I can understand a former student, but a current student usually isn't his forte."

HIMYM,2vj1zd,reymysterioguy10,2,Wed Feb 11 12:16:06 2015 UTC,"It's funny that you mention that episode, because everytime I watch it I think the same thing. I just rewatched the part you're talking about to check again and the Marshall thing is actually not a mistake. See Robin starts to tell the story ""It's about Ted.. and Zoey"" after that, Ted just reminds his kids about Zoey and then tells the kids about the night Robin cooked dinner, which must have happened before Marshalls dad died. He had to tell this to the kids because the rest of Robins story would not have made sense to the viewers otherwise. Robin doesn't even tell this part to Marshall, because he was there himself. Their conversation goes as follows: ""Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking."" ""Oh, that is too cute, say it again."" ""No, it's called manners, jerk. Now what's going on in New York, give me something"" ""There is one thing that's been going on. It's about Ted.. and Zoey."" ""Robin, I just want you to know, it's either this story you're telling me or another game of clue against myself, so make it good."" ""Oh, it's good. You see after that night non of us heard from Zoey for a while.""    I guess in this flashback where WE learn about the night Robin cooked dinner, she just tells Marshall ""You remember that night when I ruined dinner"" and then continues after that with ""You see after that night non of us heard from Zoey for a while."" So it is definitely confusing, but not a mistake. The celsius thing is a big mistake though. Kind of like the mistake where they screwed up timezones, when Victoria said she wants to talk to Ted at 11 pm, which would have been 5 am in Germany. They wanted to make it seem like Victoria meant 11 pm german time, but that would've been 5 pm in New York."

Of all the opposite gender interactions in the show, this one is such a contrast. Think of the mother-son/sister-brother relationship between Lily and Ted / Lily and Barney, or the on-and-off romantic/sexual relation between Robin and Ted / Robin and Barney.  Robin and Marshall, on the other hand, have an awkward relationship where the sole definition of each other seems to be limited to best-friend's-husband/wife's best-friend. They have an obvious discomfort for each other, and are cautious to not cross boundaries, and this paranoia brings out a lot of funny moments.  The Mermaid Theory elaborates on this, and this kind of unique relationship can be credible only if the on-screen interactions are less in number."

Barney enjoys cigars, but Robin has been known to smoke since season 2. The effects of smoking on the gang: Lily's voice becomes very deep and is voiced by Harvey Feinstein. Ted becomes exhausted after physical exercise. Marshall has been addicted since he was 13 and relapses at random points in time. Barney gets ash on his clothes. Robin... Is perfectly fine.  The withdrawal of the gang: everyone is on edge, Barney chews his nails, Marshall taps his foot, Ted is even more easily annoyed, they eat a lot.  This episode reveals the backstory of Don, which Robin becomes conflicted with. He has reached success and failed. Robin still wants to bang that guy despite him being a loser.  Robin, read the damn news like you claim you want to do with your professionalism! Funny how nobody has any long-lasting health effects due to their smoking effects.  The real last cigarette ever's: Robin in June 2013, Barney in March 2017, Lily the day she tried to get pregnant, Marshall's the day his son was born, and Ted's was two weeks into dating The Mother.  First reappearance of Arthur Hobbs, played by Bob Odenkirk. Not so much artillery anymore as he is dog lover.    I used to really like this episode, with how funny it is that Lily would sound so froggy and that smoking is basically proven not only bad, but actually shown on screen. This episode could never be made now due to smoking shortly-thereafter becoming highly restricted.  However, this episode is also the biggest continuity snarl in the history of the show. Ted keeping information from the kids (and ergo, the writers hiding it from the audience) abused the power of the unreliable narrator to the point that it showed that they can be willing to pull literally anything out of their ass, and pass it off as Ted being sneaky and retconning a lot of the show.  And what happens to the episode with Marshall and Barney having fake smoke breaks to play around and Barney gets attacked by pigeons? Don't they always smoke anyway, according to this episode? Wouldn't you know if your workplace offered cigarette breaks? It's really frustrating."

He's apparently just there to provide legal exculpation and sign everything, so a scapegoat for everything shady the company does.  Yet he's been shown meeting with North Korean military, influencing the decision for the HQ architect (a NYC skyscraper), firing various people, nearly getting fired for losing the company an important client, and the list goes on.  This was all to get back at a guy for sleeping with his girlfriend. His only motivation for this job he's kept for a decade has been to screw over this guy. But when his hippy tape is found he goes and bangs the girl, shows his friends the video, then we never hear about her again.  So we had an origin story for why Barney started sleeping around, caring about suits and being a corporate sell out. Or we have an origin story where Barney is going undercover as a sleazy guy just to screw over this one person for sleeping with his girlfriend, he then sleeps with his ex and leaves her immediately showing no lasting feeling of attachment to her.  Was his entire womanising/drinking/corporate personality a ruse? Part of his cover? If we agree that he's a moral bastion that's been working to take down this evil corp/guy then none of his character traits or storylines/growth as a person make sense.  If we take him as who he is and see him develop as a character then the whole 'he's been the good guy from the start' doesn't make sense either."

I agree with you to an extent, if it was such an emotional milestone for him then why didn't he have a bigger reaction to sleeping with the woman that caused all of the emotional distress? The idea works when you just look at the broader brush strokes of Barney's character, but when you see the actions directly related to the event it doesn't add up.   Usually in a show with such a big reveal about a character there's foreshadowing that you'll only see with multiple viewings. I was actually looking for hints at this being the plan for Barney all along and didn't see any. For a show that took great care with it's flash forwards, they could have put some hint in about Barney at some point in the show.

Over time he most likely would have come to be considered a fairly senior - and I imagine good - employee and got the other responsibilities (such as NYC skyscraper) which weren't necessarily specific to any one persons portfolio's.    The problem with this is they show us the guy who he's replacing being dragged out and shouting his innocence. There was an opening for a fall guy so Barney got hired on the spot. So it's a job that requires no knowledge of the company or it's affiliates, just someone that can take the blame and sign things. Or it's a job that involves conducting all of the companies illicit business, including deals made with North Korean generals and various other high ranking shady dealers, and can involve promotion to influential positions in the company.  The first one doesn't fit with what we've seen of Barney or his work. But it does fit in with the idea that Barney wasn't culpable so helped the FBI and the fact he was hired on the spot with nothing but a fake CV.  The second one doesn't fit in with him not being arrested, or him being hired on the spot. Why would you hire someone to conduct your companies highest level illegal activity and keep all their secrets if you've just met them and have no idea how good they'd be at the job or how trustworthy they are. If Barney is the one in charge of the shady deals to keep high level employees names off things then the evidence the FBI gather from him will make it look like he was the one making the deals anyway. Of course Barney might have had meetings with the higher-ups to be given orders, but that just comes back to why would you hire someone to the only position that can incriminate you or your company with no knowledge of that person?"

HIMYM,2vdxst,shauntp,1 point,Wed Feb 11 01:45:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly theres no point in analyzing his job. It will make no sense to anyone who has any familiarity with corporate structure/roles. Sometimes they painted him as a murky hybrid of of risk mgt/internal audit, and other times M&A. All of his roles were linked to law although he never went to law school. So it's not cohesive.  The PLEASE thing was a nice touch, but linking it all the way back to that random guy from the coffee house derailed it into a cheap joke that wrote off a lot of buildup (and created holes in the story)."
HIMYM,2vdxst,aversion25,1 point,Wed Feb 11 17:33:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to work out what his job was, I honestly don't think any answer would fit and there was no need for us to find out.

I was hoping it had already been pointed out or discussed, but when I didn't find anything here I went on my little rant. It's out of my system now though :)"
HIMYM,2vdxst,Doombot4291,2,Wed Feb 11 17:46:37 2015 UTC,"No I completely agree with you. The wrap up of that joke was very disappointing, and I would have rather they left it out. Even if they kept the PLEASE clause in it would have been way better if they figured out a way for him to ""distance"" himself from it as opposed to the SEC/arrest scenario. Like him creating another fall man, or even including a clause in the contracts that exempted him from fault."

It could also be Barney telling Ted BS to make him seem more important than he was.   It seems very strange that Barneys job and the fact that Robins family is massively rich came up at the same time. Barney tells Ted that he is not worried about the future because of Robins rich family. He still didn't have a job in the three years they were married

HIMYM,2vdxst,aversion25,1 point,Tue Feb 10 09:29:34 2015 UTC,"We did though - Ted still knew a lot about Robin (enough for her to be surprised/somewhat impressed he still remembered all that stuff), and when to be there. And Robin was always the one knocking him out of his confused/low times and getting him back on track. Plus they were both mutually weird around each other at many times showing that the feelings weren't entirely gone on either side.  The biggest thing imo was their talk in S7 when Robin comments about chemistry and timing. She had chem with both Barney/Ted, but the timing wasn't right for Ted. It didn't fit with Barney entirely either (he always loved kids throughout the series) but it seemed plausible.   Robin's flaw throughout the entire series was always denying/rejecting what she wants, or being confused about it. Easier to shut things down than open up. So if you take everything she said at face value she should have been alone the entire series."

HIMYM,2vdxst,aversion25,2,Wed Feb 11 17:45:55 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair the whole story is told from Ted's perspective - we always got his thoughts on morals, love, life etc. Rarely did we ever see the perspective of his possible relationships (Stella, Victoria, Tracy, Robin). In fact Stella definitely shows it by blindsiding him at the alter. The only outside opinion we get is Marshall - who still thinks they'll wind up together (after earlier saying it wouldn't happen).  We did see Robin reciprocate. In S1/S2 of course, and 3/4 they have those weird friends-yet-more-than-friends scenes (plus the friends with benefits stuff). Plus the scene where they're both pissed Lily broke them up is huge. They agree to the married at 40 thing (again fundamental issue is kids vs career).   Robin also gets super drunk when Ted's about to get married, and is clearly upset. She even asks Ted not to get married to Stella and hints that she thought she would marry him. Also mentions moving to Japan to get away from him getting married (same thing he tries to do by moving to Chicago in S9).  Then from S5-S8 Barney/Robin/Ted all kind of keep running back to each other after every break up. Robin almost kissed Ted after breaking up with Don (but instead laughed at his dyed hair and killed the mood). And after Kevin calls of the engagement she says yes to Ted (but gets a week to soberly think it over and say no b/c Ted still wants kids).  So there is reciprocation on both sides, but also a lot of confusion. And it always came back to the same thing - kids vs careers. That was the fundamental issue."
HIMYM,2vdxst,do_not_ask_my_name,1 point,Wed Feb 11 17:49:41 2015 UTC,"S1-S4 are well and good to make sense of the ending, but S5-S9 is the route to the end. And the two instances that you mention are the two moments when Robin is at her most vulnerable state, and is clearly not thinking through. We do not get a moment of clarity from her, or a moment where SHE is into Ted but he cannot reciprocate (like the Victoria moment in Season 1), and all these make the end undeserved for both characters."
HIMYM,2vdxst,aversion25,2,Wed Feb 11 18:04:08 2015 UTC,"Ted starts to get pretty vulnerable too - he starts to give up on finding love, and is still single by the age he planned to have kids by. S7 onwards is when it becomes a problem, and he gets pretty depressed by ~S8. His outlook is shot, which is why he does a lot of dumb things (including going overboard with the locket).  It was pretty significant when Marshall asks Robin to move out so Ted can move on. Them being roommates definitely held him back.  The two moments we get are when Robin asks him to run away with her at her wedding, and the lunch scene from the finale (which was cut for time constraints, but still pretty much cannon). He shuts her down both times. Also, is there any reason you don't count her asking him not to marry Stella? Ted clearly rejects that idea and says it's good shes not invited to the wedding.   Also I still think communication/reciprocating was Robin's biggest flaw. She found it easier to reject/cut off contact than express her feelings from s1-s9. Look at S1 - she rejects Ted constantly, but then immediately pines for him. She was battling with herself throughout the series too"
HIMYM,2vdxst,do_not_ask_my_name,1 point,Wed Feb 11 18:18:43 2015 UTC,"You are right about Ted being overwrought with finding love. All the more that I did not find his constant pining for Robin healthy. If their relationship had still had the freshness and sparks that was there in Seasons 1-4, I would have welcomed the end.  I do appreciate that Ted shut her down in the moments you've mentioned. But my biggest bother was that even when she tried to run away with him, or dissuade him from his wedding, it was the Lobster all over again. (Tell me a moment when she indicates feelings for him when he's available?) She as much as says it out that she views him as a safety stand and a grand gesture guy - her ""love"" for him never seemed genuine."
HIMYM,2vdxst,aversion25,2,Wed Feb 11 18:27:51 2015 UTC,"Yea admittedly I've seen the first 2-3 seasons way more times than the later stuff, so that's probably why it didn't bother me that much.   That's definitely true (it was always when she's not available) but it applies to Ted as well until his life falls apart. He wasn't missing Robin at all when he was with Stella/Zoey (I think Barney even commented on that too). He then get's fixated on the idea of Robin when he's feeling at his low.  The Victoria thing probably hurt too - an engagement fell through b/c he couldn't not be friends with Robin. So even when he's moving on she still is in the way etc.  I read on here a comment I liked to describe the situation - S1-4 Robin would never date someone like Barney, and S5-8 her wouldn't date someone like Ted. The show set up their writing so that she could have been with either of them, and then threw the clock 20 years in the future so anything was plausible.    The finale should have elaborated on Barney's shortcomings in the marriage (as some basis of comparison for why Ted was better other than him being the safety school) and kept the lunch scene for sure."
HIMYM,2vdxst,Domyfranky,0,Thu Feb 12 11:09:46 2015 UTC,"Yes,we saw her,she kissed him in season 5 and 7,two times,and she tried to run off with him before her wedding! she took her hand first in episode 8x23,and she got drunk during season 4 because she suffered for Ted's wedding with Stella."
HIMYM,2vdxst,do_not_ask_my_name,1 point,Thu Feb 12 13:58:20 2015 UTC,"The two moments in Season 5 and Season 7, were at Robin's most vulnerable moments. She obviously was not thinking clearly, and her kissing him screamed of rebound. While I accept that the carousel moment was indeed a sweet moment, it was still a vulnerable and emotional one, where she was confused over committing to Barney. Again, not thinking clearly.  Moments such as the drunkenness over Stella's wedding, and the Halloween rooftop party, are simply Lobster Theory. She only wants what she can't have.  And her attempted runaway bride stint was the most selfish, stupid thing ever, where she says outright that Ted is simply her safety stand. She only views him as the guy who'll give her security and big gestures. That's convenience. Not love.  My point is, we never saw a single solid moment where Robin showed feelings for Ted unconditionally."

HIMYM,2vdxst,aversion25,0,Tue Feb 10 13:38:42 2015 UTC,It did fit their earlier themes they laid out in the beginning of the series though. Imo it suits the show well when considered as a whole as opposed to season to season. People are caught up in excusing Barney as a character and loving Tracy bc they both acted phenomenally
HIMYM,2vdxst,do_not_ask_my_name,1 point,Tue Feb 10 14:19:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  When people say ""Watch the earlier seasons, you'll get the ending,"" isn't the show supposed to be a story narrated in an order, where an event leads up to another? How can dismissing the later seasons even remotely justify the end? When we read a book, can we say, ""Read Chapters 1,2,3 and the Epilogue. That's enough.""?"
HIMYM,2vdxst,aversion25,0,Wed Feb 11 17:40:52 2015 UTC,"You need the later seasons character growth to justify the ending though as well. The ending would be bad if it was after the first few seasons imo (albeit much better received).  You start with Ted being naive about love/""the one""/being ready to settle down, and Robin being closed off/distant/career focused. The first few seasons has them as the typical fairy tale love at first sight couple, whereas the later seasons dispels their naivety. And yet they still wind up together, but for different reasons.   I think people are uncomfortable accepting that Barney, a broken man, stayed broken. Even after all the effort he put into changing himself he was unsuccessful. His maturity point is his kid.  Similarly Robin, who was always hiding/stubborn about her feelings, winds up getting what she always said she wanted and then regretting it. Her maturity point is achieving career success and her failed marriage for perspective.  Ted matures by meeting Tracy and dispelling his idealistic notions about love and marriage. He's no longer spouting crap about the one or busting out those grand gestures. It's no longer being forced. And her death changes his perspective on his ""planned out life"", which is very consistent with all the seasons.  If you take the later seasons at face value you'll argue that Barney/Robin should have changed each other and the writing is a cop out. If you assume differing maturity points it becomes easier to digest/more consistent."

I thought NPH's acting when Barney meets his daughter was EXCELLENT. It didn't help that in the months leading up to the finale my buddy had been insisting the Mother dies, which I did not buy into. Cristin Milioti played the character so goddamn well that even though we saw her for about a season, Tracy's death felt as powerful as a main characters would have. In addition, learning that the creators had 30 extra minutes of content (In TV Time, actually 20 minutes with 10 minutes of ads) I was disappointed CBS chose to air a sitcom that wound up going nowhere in favor of a network and television legend. The extra footage apparently contained a funeral scene, which would have had a major impact on the episode itself, and ending the 'Ted jumped immediately to Robin' remarks.  I saved it on my DVR and re watched it a few months later. Same conditions (No internet, watch the ads, etc.) and, in short, it was better. Oh, so much better. In this viewing I thought the finale, for what it was, was perfect. Remember, this was the end of a nine year show, which could easily have went on longer. Closing off this went about as well as it was able to.   The show wrapped as well as it could have. The finale, like it or not, is a television masterpiece. The years and years of preparation that went into it, the scriptwriting was excellent, the directing and plot was beautiful. All credit to the staff and crew."

Maggie is a one-off character I'm surprised hadn't shown up yet in the HIMYM universe because of how relatable this girl is for young people: a perfect girl next-door whose window of opportunity to date her is really small due to her loving relationships. Everyone wants to date her, but to those who don't have her she's the one that got away. Maggie is played by Joanna Garcia Swisher. With the chestnut brown hair, realistically beautiful body and somewhat modest choice of wardrobe, she captured that essence of the girl next-door. Without that, the episode would have failed. Joanna Garcia Swisher is best-known for playing Cheyenne in Reba and Ariel in Once Upon a Time. She's also previously costarred with Josh Radnor in Not Another Teen Movie as Sandy Sue and Freaks and Geeks with Jason Segel as Vicki Appleby. The plot summary above doesn't mention Barney's quest to pick up a girl while wearing overalls, which gets him involved with the Maggie quadrangle because of his need to complete challenges. Fifteen-year-old Marshall is kind of a douche, isn't he? I think the sandwiches really mellowed him out. Are we just going to pretend that people were really interested in Barney with his overalls over a suit before Robin made farmer jokes?   This is one of my favorite individual episodes of the show. While it didn't progress the mother story at all (in fact, other than Girls vs. Suits this season doesn't really progress it at all), this is one of those stories that HIMYM can tell well: a sitcom spin on a modern truth about love.

HIMYM,2v8zof,Mixcoatll,14,Mon Feb 9 14:10:19 2015 UTC,"HIMYM has countless continuity errors, but that can be expected and forgiven when you consider this show ran for almost a decade. The ones I can think of right now: Lily and Marshall say they shared a toothbrush for years, but they have seperate ones in season 1. When we first see Tom on James' phone it's a completely different guy than later on. Marshall saying he was never in a fight in Season 1 and then in Season 4 knocking out Doug because he and his brothers always fought. I don't know when exactly this was, but somewhere early in the series Lily says ""My dad is not gonna pay for that wedding."", but we later find out that she and her father aren't even close and that he couldn't pay for a wedding anyway. In the episode where Marshalls Fiero get's trashed we learn that Barney never learned to drive, but he talks about having a car before that and he drove Teds mom to the airport, which happened before the Fiero episode. Marshall says that Barney cooks naked, but when Lily crashes at his place he says he doesn't want to have food in the house. Also his stove is a cardboard display. Not sure about this one, because I only noticed it recently: In the new years episode where Ted rents a Limo Robin is afraid of Not-Mobys gun, but we learn later that she is a gun nut. Not sure if this counts though. And the last one I can think of right now is in the Pilot/Finale combined. Robin was hanging out with a few friends in the Pilot, and one of them got dumped. In the finale, which begins with a scene right after ""Purple Giraffe"", Robin says ""to top it all of, I have no friends"".    I'm sure there are a lot more of these plotholes and small errors, but as I said in a series that runs this long I can easily look past it :)    Edit: I just thought of another one while rewatching. Lily tells scooter that she just dated him because he looked a little bit like Kurt Cobain, but we later find out that he looked completely different when they first met."

HIMYM,2v8zof,poi88,5,Mon Feb 9 03:09:42 2015 UTC,"That's true, but those episodes are 2 seasons apart so he could've easily learned how to drive in that time.

HIMYM,2v8zof,Minkelol,3,Mon Feb 9 03:15:13 2015 UTC,Barney not being able to drive is actually the worst.  Find out in Fieroasco - he can't and has never learnt to drive.  Literally the next episode Ted and Robin are moving in together and Barney steals the moving truck. Does he push it?  Also the next season in the bracket we have the flashback to Barney stealing the girls truck and leaving her in the woods.   Ugh.
HIMYM,2v8zof,me1ris,3,Mon Feb 9 12:22:52 2015 UTC,The part in the Fiero episode where Barney couldn't drive was a flash back. Barney probably actually knew how to drive when the Fiero was in the shop since he is seen driving the next episode.

She played more than one sport. :) Hockey is pretty much played all year around in Canada and Field hockey is played except during the winter months.  Kaboom! :)
HIMYM,2v8zof,AvsFanInSTL,1 point,Wed Feb 11 14:25:24 2015 UTC,"Field hockey in Canada:       In Canada, field hockey is generally restricted to spring, summer and early autumn seasons, except in southwestern British Columbia, where it can be played year-round. It is principally a girls' sport in schools, but is played by both men and women in adult leagues across the country. In the late 1990s, registered membership was just over 10,000 (8,200 women and 1,200 men) and the estimated total playing population, including school players, was 30,000.  The modern form of field hockey was first played in Canada in British Columbia. In 1896, the first recorded match in Canada was played by Vancouver girls, and the Vancouver Ladies Club was formed. Men were also playing at the turn of the century in Vancouver and Victoria, and a Vancouver League came into existence in 1902. The first women's organization in Canada was formed in Vancouver in 1927.  After World War II, the immigration of players to Canada from all parts of the Commonwealth of Nations influenced the establishment of field hockey across the country, and by 1959 the game was being played in the Maritimes, Ontario and Alberta. The Canadian (men's) Field Hockey Association was founded in 1961; the Canadian Women's FHA a year later. In 1992 the CFHA and the CWFHA merged to form Field Hockey Canada.

HIMYM,2v8zof,rose_tattoo,2,Fri Feb 13 14:51:00 2015 UTC,I don't think that's a continuity error. Robin lied about playing team sports since she was still pretty new to the others and was trying to hide her messed up past - I mean she had played in a boys team as a boy under pressure from her father.  Here's a big error that hardly ever gets noticed: In s5e18 Barney says he never has a bad picture while Marshall's eyes are always closed in pictures. But both of these contradict the title theme!
HIMYM,2v8zof,RusVir,1 point,Mon Feb 9 16:45:15 2015 UTC,They never really connect Lily's parents. Were they divorced? Separated? In the same house but never interacted? Why didn't she stop her dad from being so board game obsessed?   I've always had lots of questions about Lily's life growing up and the show does a terrible job with her back story besides how bad her dad was.
HIMYM,2v8zof,Mixcoatll,3,Mon Feb 9 14:09:46 2015 UTC,"They were divorced.  The show mentions it a few times.   Lily is young and getting her tonsils out, and her dad is rambling while sitting next to her on the hospital bed.  He almost mentions that he and her mom are ""getting a div...""  but stops himself as he realizes lily's face go from already scared to terrified and sad.   Another example off the top of my head is where Ted brings the blue stroller as a gift to lily and Marshalls baby shower, only to learn that Robin arrived early with the same stroller in red.  He apologizes for the issues he and Robin are causing by having a falling out, but lily reassures him: ""Ted, I'm a child of divorce...

Mickey would later show up in a few later season episodes as a more likable version of what he is here. Fun fact: Chris Elliot is only 14 years older than Alyson Hannigan. Not the worst TV parental problem, Chevy Chase's dad on Community was played by a younger man.  This is the introduction of the ""you're dead to me"" look. I thought it would be used more, though Marshall eventually perfects it in ""Say Cheese."" ""Diseases"" being lead based and all over the turkey makes me wonder what they eventually ate after they slapped Barney. Best gag of the episode: Ted lying about being in love with Robin just so he can slap Barney in his stupid face. Was anticipating a Robin slap, didn't expect Marshall to swoop in and get it done.    Other than the introduction of Mickey, there really isn't much to say about it. Lily's childhood is now getting interesting background, and Mickey was a horrible person in this debut.

It was still hilariously funny, but the later seasons are more dramatic as the gang really starts to find out where they want to go in life.  This episode, however, brought us back to their funny stupid misadventures in the bar. It had a good plot, funny one liners, and the characters really stayed true to the original designs.  And then the ending brought us back to where How I Met Your Mother was in that point in time . It reminded us all what the series was all about.

HIMYM,2v3j7f,jelatinman,7,Sat Feb 7 15:51:18 2015 UTC,"The Playbook was first introduced in this episode. It came off as surprising to me considering it's referenced a lot throughout the series. That's what you get for starting with reruns! The Playbook eventually became Barney's arc symbol. As it got bigger, his insecurities became more apparent. The Final Page is the culmination of everything his arc worked toward.  Barney's extremely high success rate is rather unusual, as he failed often in every season but this one. I personally found comedy in his failure to pick up chicks, because the wrong play can make Barney super creepy. Oh New York, how adorable that only 4 years later your civil union joke became outdated. The end of the episode shows the first appearance of Don, successfully fulfilling the prophecy that every chance you take to focus on your work leads you to a relationship. Ted would later fall into this when his biggest project yet lead him to Zoey.  This is tied with Slap Bet with the highest IMDb rating (both 9.4). The highest rated is season 9's ""How Your Mother Met Me,"" with a 9.5 rating.    I didn't like this episode too much, mostly because Barney can be a very dangerous character to screw up. One can argue that it's so over the top that it's hilarious and the girls deserve it, but I find it funnier when he's pathetic or doing it for the sake of a Challenge.   /u/All_For_Anonymous shoutout"
HIMYM,2v3j7f,All_For_Anonymous,1 point,Sat Feb 7 16:48:02 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks for the shoutout.  It is interesting this is the first time the playbook was introduced and I think it did so in good fashion. It tied together with his high success rate in just this episode to show how quickly he gets over the breakup, but I also agree that Barney isn't funny when he's going on about how awesome he is or successfully conning women, it's funny when he fails because of his overconfidence and the way he takes it even when looking like a complete creep.  Since the playbook itself is a funny concept given how interesting the plays are, it's not surprising that this is a highly popular episode, even if it was particularly funny in my opinion."

That's my take on it though"
HIMYM,2v5hew,PoisoningPerception,1 point,Sun Feb 8 09:39:45 2015 UTC,One thing I noticed on How I Met Your Mother is their inconsistency with the characters and plots. There are more than Gary Blauman. Anyone else with me?
HIMYM,2v5hew,alligator___,1 point,Tue Feb 10 23:38:08 2015 UTC,Gary blauman was in multiple episodes often having a different personality but almost always working at Barneys office. He was part of the Blauman and Billson duo. Unimportant: he's played by Tarren Killam who is on SNL but who is married to Cobie Smulders
HIMYM,2v69nj,brovin2,3,Sun Feb 8 07:16:10 2015 UTC,"I've seen different people complain about different aspects of the finale, but one I think everyone agrees with is the tonal whiplash of confirming that, yes, the Mother is dead, in a monologue from Ted over a montage in the end of scenes with Ted and the Mother together, without showing any scenes of Ted or anyone grieving after the Mother died.   Mind you, that's not the moment. It's that right after confirming the death to the audience via a monologue, the show immediately go to Ted's kids saying that the whole point of the story was that Ted was trying to get the kid's blessing to go out with Aunt Robin, and the conversation goes on from there.  I've seen the defense that from Ted and his kid's perspective, that the death happened years ago and they moved on, but the show never let the audience let the death sink in.   Only other aspect I've seen people generally agree on is that having the finale go through 17+ years of story in roughly two episodes was too much, and it was all the more aggravating given the final season seemed to stretch the wedding weekend unnecessarily.  The other reasons people are really hard on the finale vary depending on the matter of opinion and execution (and it's there where people are actually very vocal on the situation), but I think these two reasons are the show's biggest failings in the finale/final season."
HIMYM,2v69nj,gizmo1492,2,Sun Feb 8 12:34:28 2015 UTC,"Alyson Hannigan even agrees with it. She said if they could have included the 18 minutes of deleted scenes, the Ted & Robin tonal clash would be solved."

HIMYM,2v2cus,ILikeTurtles012,11,Sat Feb 7 05:07:01 2015 UTC,Loved the entire series and loved the finale. Only and only gripe was the lack of an extended finale. I really think it needed a solid 55-60 minutes to really nail some of the things they breezed through in the finale. Loved the ending though.
HIMYM,2v2cus,sevintoid,5,Sat Feb 7 07:06:56 2015 UTC,"I loved it, but i have a theory why people didnt, here's it. I ate the series (1-9 seasons in ~3 weeks) so first season and my feeling of ted-robin was really fresh on my mind, unlike people who have been watching the show for 9 years, the only change i would do to the finale is that they shoulda show a little more detail on some scenes of the finale, it made it feel a little bit rushed, on my opinion. But overall i loved it especially the last scene the song its just so good.  Excuse my poor english please :("
HIMYM,2v2cus,recr3t,1 point,Sat Feb 7 14:39:51 2015 UTC,I also watched the show in about 2 weeks but I still hated the finale. Guess your theory doesn't apply to me :P

Why would you tell your kids a story that bashes their dead mother.  When my mom talks about my dad she makes him seem like a saint. Her new boyfriend now is a great guy, but she does not talk about him like she did with my dad. You naturally want to shield your kids."
HIMYM,2v2cus,Zmooth,3,Sat Feb 7 14:10:32 2015 UTC,I Liked it too. The mother dying made me cry but Ted and Robin are met for each other.

HIMYM,2v2cus,sanitysepilogue,6,Sat Feb 7 08:37:43 2015 UTC,"Too bad it doesn't mean anything.  The finale told us that nothing changes and no one has any personal growth. He is just going to abonden the baby when it gets too hard, just like every responsibility he ever had."

HIMYM,2v2cus,jelatinman,5,Sat Feb 7 10:13:37 2015 UTC,"Exactly my problem with it. The finale would make sense if it happened at the end of the 3rd season, but they ignored 6 other seasons of character development."

HIMYM,2v2cus,gizmo1492,4,Sun Feb 8 10:56:52 2015 UTC,"Regardless, they undid way too much of his development. The daughter doesn't mean anything if we now see that every time he's given a life challenge, he runs. What you're basing your opinion on is a small glimmer in comparison to what we've actually seen. And the one time where he showed that not only did he want to change, but was making great strides for it, he ran out when things got difficult. Managing a child is way more challenging than a romantic relationship, so we can assume that he will cave on this as well"
HIMYM,2v2cus,Whine_Flu,2,Sat Feb 7 18:09:49 2015 UTC,"Raising a child is a REAL responsability,is not comparable to marriage. And you are saying the wrong when you say he run off the challenges. Barney ACCEPT the challenges,and even if his marriage failed,that doesn't mean ""he ran off"". I really think you missed the point of his character."

The girl who Barney remembers as Meg from her butt is actually April Bowlby, aka Kandi from Two and a Half Men. She played that role for six years. And another person now retroactively famous! Matt L. Jones, aka Badger on Breaking Bad, guest stars as the pizza delivery man! Currently he is starring in Mom as Baxter. While I loathe this episode, fat Barney is one of the funniest and unexpected turns I've ever seen from the show.  You think that version of Robin is ugly? ""Big Days"" makes this Robin look like heaven. Alan Thicke mentions at the end of the episode the existence of another Robin Sparkles media, this time a low-budget Canadian childrens' show. This would later be revealed season six's ""Glitter."" Unlike what most people say, Lily seems to have learned her lesson from ""The Front Porch"" and actually hasn't manipulated anyone's relationships until this episode. She meddles far less after this point, due to dealing with a baby and all, but her past manipulations are still coming out.   I really hate how they broke up Barney and Robin. I understand why the writers did it; they jumped the gun on this relationship and nearly killed what made these characters so great in the first place. But it was way too abrupt and completely played for laughs despite being taken seriously for the entirety of season 4 and the first few episodes of this season. It was a mess."

I keep coming back to the twisted image of these two not caring for their appearances when they later start (continue) to show an interest in one another and I just can't see it working again, although that does eventually redeem itself given how much airtime where they do work together.  Back to the ""old Robin"", I personally think they didn't go far enough. She still looks quite attractive, just like she'd had a bad night sleep and it was early in the morning.  Is it possible for someone to summon (/u/All_For_Anonymous) me each rewatch episode? I never look at my subscribed subreddits feed and I will never remember to check back each day."
HIMYM,2uzneu,ZDHELIX,0,Sat Feb 7 11:18:32 2015 UTC,"I agree that they rushed their relationship a lot. they dated for like 5 episodes? It didn't really help that the next episode was The Playbook, where Barney actually uses their breakup to his advantage. I didn't really like this episode either though it was painful watching Barney and Robin being total jerks to each other"
HIMYM,2uzneu,Slugggo,1 point,Sat Feb 7 20:43:08 2015 UTC,"Funny you should mention the Playbook, the thread has been up for a while! I'm not a mod though so I can't sticky it."

HIMYM,2uyczx,jelatinman,4,Fri Feb 6 05:07:59 2015 UTC,So he lied about a lie then...
HIMYM,2uyczx,Awesomeguyandbob,2,Fri Feb 6 05:56:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think he did consciously. At the very least, I think in seasons 4-6, Ted genuinely moved on from Robin and buried his thoughts of her deep down (which looking back I can now understand why people were annoyed it was brought back in seasons 7-9 saying it was a rehash). Other than the Twin Beds episode, the two were pretty platonic, even when they became sex buddies.  Great reminder though about Slapsgiving 2! Completely forgot about that one."
HIMYM,2uyczx,Jaspers47,2,Fri Feb 6 06:10:09 2015 UTC,He really wanted to slap Barney.

HIMYM,2uxjzh,jelatinman,2,Fri Feb 6 01:12:51 2015 UTC,Had to delete it because he has said in an earlier season that he never figured out how he got the pineapple. Continuity.

HIMYM,2uxjzh,kalila855,2,Mon Feb 9 08:23:41 2015 UTC,"Makes sense that given season 9 is the final season, that the team would try to put in as many references as they possibly can as a tribute to the fans that have been there since the beginning.  I highly doubt that every episode was referenced. I don't even think every running gag was referenced.  Did the line ""How dare you...and what is that?"" get referenced in the final season? I got sick of it early on in season 8 but I remember that being one of the more iconic gags from the season."
HIMYM,2uxjzh,gizmo1492,2,Fri Feb 6 04:36:08 2015 UTC,Didn't that line appear only twice?

HIMYM,2uuba8,jelatinman,3,Thu Feb 5 05:11:32 2015 UTC,"Hilarious episode that ended up being a punch in the gut at the end due to how severely incompatible Barney and Robin are in their first relationship (which had the worst breakup ever in ""The Rough Patch""; but we'll get to that).  Even in fantasy sequence, it's great to see Lily be with somebody alone that's not Marshall or Robin because too many times she never got to be someone's buddy or piece of misogynist cardboard. She was almost always with Marshall by the end, not helped by the baby.  Funny how Ted can always talk about sex, but when the story concerns sounds of sex it needs to be censored in the clever HIMYM way. Way to go, CBS!  Barney and Robin's coping methods are actually really funny, even if it does kill their first chance at a relationship. These two commitment avoiders hooking up showed that not only are they afraid of that, they're afraid of conflict in general. Robin is less afraid of an armed robber than a proposal, and Barney's less worried about being pinned for fraud than having an honest discussion of his feelings with a girl. I appreciate the character development from both sides, and their ""will they or won't they"" is, in my opinion, far better than Ross/Rachel and Ted/Robin."
HIMYM,2uuba8,gizmo1492,2,Thu Feb 5 05:18:58 2015 UTC,"I always attributed the two being able to resolve conflict and communicate properly as the reason for their breakup, or at least it should have been. (I mean, the two did talk about the whole work issue but that wasn't ever brought up or foreshadowed...ugh!!!)  It's just funny since that is why Ted/Robin didn't end up working in season 2. They weren't able to resolve their issues. But at least they talked about them. And iono, I always felt like the communication issue was the one thing that was highlighted with Ted/Robin in the second half of the show which is why I always thought the two could work, and it's in stark contrast to Barney/Robin trying to talk issues out ."
HIMYM,2uuba8,keremy,2,Fri Feb 6 04:41:35 2015 UTC,"When one person is okay with talking, they can coax the talking out of the reluctant one (and Robin still had problems really diving deep down, since at her core she's not into mushy emotional stuff). Barney and Robin were both the reluctant ones, allowing themselves to become extremely passive aggressive and annoyed at each other."
HIMYM,2uuba8,keremy,2,Fri Feb 6 05:06:42 2015 UTC,"Hey, thank you for doing that. The reason it was stalled (me not posting them often) was because people not showing interest to them. Hope it will get better if we do it more often.   I loved Robin's avoiding technique in this episode!"
