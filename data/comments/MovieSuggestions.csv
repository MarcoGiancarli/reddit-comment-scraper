MovieSuggestions,3e0ofj,curlyjazzman,16,Tue Jul 21 01:32:18 2015 UTC,"The common misconception about an 'anti-hero' is that it's an immoral protagonist. That isn't the case. The hero (i.e. the protagonist) can be moral or immoral (or change from one to the other, like Walter White). Practically all of Shakespeare's tragic heroes are essentially bad (or at least unpleasant) people.  An anti-hero is someone who goes against the traditional idea of the hero being this active person who does great (as in: 'big' rather than 'good') deeds (which, ultimately, drive the story he is in forwards). Homer Simpson is an anti-hero because he would always rather be sitting on his couch than doing anything significant. An anti-hero is someone who rejects doing notable, notorious or noble things and instead opts to sell happy meals like Lester Burnham in American Beauty or buy Ikea furniture like the narrator of Fight Club.  Anyway, to get back on topic, I wrote my masters dissertation largely focused on the idea of the heroes that start as good people and end up as evil tyrants. Walter White is a good example, but the original - and still the best - idea of this archetype is Macbeth. While we wait for the awesome-looking Fassbender version to come out later this year, I would recommend checking out either the Patrick Stewart version, or for something a little different: Throne of Blood, which is essentially Macbeth with Samurai."

It's not really ""scary"" in any way but, like The Babadook, it's an exercise in intriguing conceptual horror/social commentary.    I'm inclined to think that the slow pacing was done on purpose, because that's how the followers behaved.  They didn't run like the zombies in 28 Days Later, but the point was that they were absolutely inexorable - once you're infected, you will never be safe from them, unless you have a loyal partner to watch your back."
MovieSuggestions,3e0cpv,darknessvisible,0,Tue Jul 21 15:08:41 2015 UTC,"I'd actually prefer zombie movies with proper zombies then. You know the ones that walks slowly towards the closest human it notices, that wasn't fit to compete in the olympics, like the 28 days later ""zombies"" did. They were actually ""infected"" as far as I can remember, and never refered to as ""zombies"".  ""It follows"" is basicly like a zombie movie except it's only after 1 person at a time and no one else can see it.  I'd personally prefer ""Dawn of the dead"" (either the original or the 2004 remake, both are good) before ""It Follows""."

A ""scary"" movie is could be like a dark thriller, so no, I want legitimate horror without all the bullshit that seems to just re-innovate what we all know is going to happen due to archetypal plot points. I just feel like horror movies antagonists need to be developed further -  it's not fair to viewers to just throw a crazy murderer into a forest where teenagers are, or for ""that house to be haunted"" just as a new couple moves in after a death. It's as if they just drop down:   1. Evil 'noun'  2. Stupid people (victims) 3. Ex-machina at the end to redeem victims (and/or) twist explaining the Evil's intention   In my example films, T&DvE had the both-parties-misinformed plot for explaining both sides of the story; and CitW used the !SPOILER!. I just believe they were both done very well and didn't have to rely on intentionally dark shots, jump scares, or unrealistic plot points to be successful."

Without giving the story away, the main character doesn't have much of a life to live for and finds out something that sets him on a path for revenge.  Different type of character than the movies you mentioned but I think you'd like it."
