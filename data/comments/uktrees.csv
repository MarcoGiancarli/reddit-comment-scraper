uktrees,3dy283,Pupyshizz,15,Mon Jul 20 13:54:59 2015 UTC,"As long as you make an effort to keep it smellproof you should be fine in a tent bag. Smelly proof baggies are cheap as chips (get them from your local smoke shop, you want the ones with the big, thick sealant strip that are waaaaya more rigid than your average baggie. Failing this, get 'em here - they have discreet shipping as standard if you're worried.) Another method is to use a shampoo bottle (MAKING SURE YOU KEEP YOUR GREENS WATERPROOF) topped off with actual shampoo. This should get you past most checks.  The single best piece of advice anyone can give / get in this situation, however is as such: Don't make them want to search you / your bags.  Try your best not to look shifty or paranoid, don't go through the gates already high as shit, don't get seen blatantly scoping out the security measures, or doing the akward last minute shuffle as one your dudes decides he doesn't wanna take the goods through after all. COMMIT. And don't be hesitant to open your bag and let the guy take a look if he asks. Do your best to forget about the weed. In the event they have dogs at the check - remember that they're trained to detect drugs, yes - but also to act on command from the handler.  If you're really worried about ending up empty handed, split the weed up between you guys and leave gaps in your group as you enter so there's no association between you all. With 4 gs each, even if one of you gets caught you're not totally fuckin boned. This also applies once inside the festival. Have a stash well hidden back at camp so even if you get caught whilst in a crowd or by a random patrol you're fine for the rest of the weekend. Make friends with the people in tents near you (spread the love if they smoke too) and chances are they'll keep an eye on your shit. Try to find a space alienated from families or young kids. Many festivals I've been to have a check between the camping area and the stage area, so try to minimize your movement between the two.  This went on a little, my bad, man."

Festival security are unlikely to search your tent bag but they pretty much not allowed (unless theyve found drugs or something) to search u under your clothes and even if they pat you down they wont feel it. Also if one of you somehow did get caught you havent put all your eggs in one basket. I always strap everything to my gooch and they never find it even when patting you down.

From the looks of it (kinda propagandised FTB facebook posts so forgive me if I do fall for it) cannabis smokers even seem to be turning up at non specific smoker events having their sesh and getting along fine there.   That Earth expo event in Peterborough sounded fantastic too , hopefully next time the security at the event will be as level headed as they apparently were this year.   I'm also hoping the British Glass Scene starts to get more exposure too what with their big meet up having just been and gone too.   So whilst I agree that I kinda don't like the image that the mainstream media is unfortunately able to portray us as, its really up to us to big up the other parts of the culture too.   You know where I do think we are dropping the ball though and maybe again its just through my experience is at universities.   Cannabis still really isn't as accepted there as I'd have hoped and generally people seem to be unaware of the actual reality unless they've researched it or been told it enough times to repeat ""yeah it kills cancer doesn't it? Shame its illegal"" .  A louder pro cannabis/harm reduction voice in our universities would do good.   I'd imagine all the Student unions are bought out by all the booze companies they get their booze from but surely there must be some kinda argument that can be made to universities about tacitly supporting cannabis over alcohol.
