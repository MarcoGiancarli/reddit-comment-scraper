Out of a window in a truck I saw this tiny little kitty, at first I thought it was a wimpy little dog but it turned out to be a siamese kitten.  I turned to my friend and pointed out and we couldn't figure out for the life of us what was going on.  All cats I've had are scared shitless  of being in a car.  But I suppose some cats are more like dogs I suppose.  Still just weird to see a cat enjoying a cat breeze."

Other symptoms that may accompany this include compulsive pacing and circling, changes in learned (trained) behavior, seizures, damaged reflexes, and visual problems. Some of these symptoms may lead to lesions, for example, sores on the feet as a result of compulsive pacing, or injuries to the face/head as a result of pressing the head against a surface for long periods of time."

In a lot of small ways she acted different than other cats. Never got very good at socializing for example. If you pet her, she'd purr at first, but eventually bite you without warning, often while still purring. Had to bottle feed her/wipe her butt with a warm washcloth to get food in (and out) of her."
