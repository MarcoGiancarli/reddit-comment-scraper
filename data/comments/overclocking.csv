I think there may be a BIOS glitch with gigabytes new F3 bios because upon booting a failed OC, it will refuse to boot even if you lower it, but i just tried booting from a saved profile from earlier (4.3Ghz) and it works fine... it might just be a issue of needing to reset the settings to refresh the BIOS.  and about using prime, is Intel Burn Test ok too?"

overclocking,3e35qo,explodingpens,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:38:30 2015 UTC,"Depending on how you have your case fans hooked up, you might be able to set them to a more aggressive profile in BIOS. Same goes for the cpu fan, which is almost definitely PWM controlled and thus configurable, although unfortunately all CPU fan profiles are likely to run at 100% at 85+C anyway.   You could also look into reseating the heatsink on the cpu, and make sure you use the right amount of thermal paste of a quality brand (noctua, arctic, whatever, google it). Dot method, slightly less paste than a grain of rice. Very important not to use too much.   Be careful not to leave  the heat sink without pressure or let it lift even slightly from the heatspreader when you mount it. Maintaining pressure, it's also a good idea to twist the heat sink a few degrees back and forth before it's fastened in order to eliminate air bubbles and get a nice, even spread.  If you feel your cooler is already correctly mounted, or if reseating doesn't help, a new cooler is probably the best option. If yours is already good, maybe you should get a new case to lower ambient temperatures. Not sure what a H400 is, but if it's this, then I think it's something that could be improved upon. A quality case would be cooler and quieter as well as improve your CPU temperatures.  If your ambient temperatures are already low, your CPU cooler is already good and your fan profiles are set up correctly, a fun option would be to delid your cpu using the vice method. This voids your warranty and should only be considered if you can afford to risk the hardware for a few hundred extra megahertz of OC.   I also have a 4690K, and I went with the delid option. It was pretty easy and all it cost me was the liquid metal to put between the chip and heatspreader, but of course also the warranty and much of the resale value of the chip. So again, only consider it if you're an enthusiast with enough disposable income to go a little nuts, but I'm happy with my results. I stress test at max 83C 80C on a silent fan profile at 4.6 GHz / 1.275V on air cooling and the CPU fan isn't audible over the GPU no matter what game I'm playing.  Edit: New temp reading after letting the gallium settle."

overclocking,3e35qo,kluless,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:04:29 2015 UTC,He is right.  The difference 100 MHz makes is negligible and that heat will degrade your chip 24/7.  You can always pick up a better cooling solution if you want to go higher.

overclocking,3e22hr,Amavaa,3,Tue Jul 21 10:35:17 2015 UTC,Just use a fixed voltage and let speedstep and c state power savings do their job.  Also make sure the volts under full load are reported the same as what you set. Check CPUz
overclocking,3e22hr,Flerbenderper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:21:54 2015 UTC,"By ""fixed"" do you mean manual voltage? Even with C-states and Speedstep enabled the CPU doesn't undervolt on idle, which is originally why I switched to adaptive. Is it normal for the motherboard to supply +0.035v overhead on top of my set ""Max Turbo Voltage""? From my understanding, it should take advantage of all power saving features while never going above the set maximum voltage. The only way I can achieve this is by undervolting to ~1.216v and setting a negative offset to compensate for the motherboard's overhead. Am I missing something? Here are two screenshots, one from an overnight stress test, and one an hour into a game. Both are using my adaptive 1.216v with -0.035v offset.  Stress: https://i.imgur.com/Gsbyod6.jpg  Game: https://i.imgur.com/DyXnVnA.png  Am I reading the sensors incorrectly? It shows that, while gaming, my VCore went from the set maximum (1.216v) to 1.232v. Hopefully I can figure this out so I can run at the 4.7ghz 1.216v my CPU is capable of."
overclocking,3e22hr,Flerbenderper,2,Tue Jul 21 18:51:18 2015 UTC,"Ok so for adaptive you set the idle voltage and an offset for the load, so 1.1v idle would need 0.150v offset for 1.25 v at load.  I use fixed volts (yes manual) and it does undervolt and underclock at idle. Check windows power settings and set minimum CPU to like 15% Check each power save description for its purpose and usage. E aware that sometimes power saving will.interfere with an overclock so set it up without ant first, and keep testing as you enable them one at a time."
overclocking,3e22hr,Flerbenderper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:30:25 2015 UTC,"I was setting up adaptive under the impression it'd automatically adjust voltages below your set maximum voltage according to current frequencies, but my motherboard seems to be acting as you described adaptive. I can't set the offset to 0.0v, so if I were stick with adaptive (I have my doubts now..), and I know my CPU is stable at 4.7GHz @ 1.216v, should I just set my voltage to 1.200v with a +0.016v offset? Or should I bring it lower and increase the offset?  From the information I've received here, I'll probably be making the switch to manual. Any idea why my CPU doesn't undervolt itself on manual voltage with C-states set to auto? It'll underclock itself fine, but the voltage remains a constant. What is setting the Windows Power Setting to 15% supposed to do? I've tried 0%, 1%, 10%, 15%, and 100% from information I've found via Google, but no one ever states what it's supposed to accomplish. It doesn't seem to change anything from what I can tell."
overclocking,3e22hr,jbourne0129,2,Tue Jul 21 23:04:16 2015 UTC,"You can use Windows settings to custom configure how much it underclocks. That is the point of it, just set it to what you want, but anything less than 15% is ineffective. So you can set 50% if you want more speed for low usage tasks, etc.  If there's an option for c states to be (enabled) specifically and not just auto, use that, cause auto options can be silly.   For adaptive go by my example. Use a lower voltage for idle (say 1.0v (depends on what works) and make the offset do all the work for load usages.  I don't think adaptive is really that good and too much effort. Fixed volts and auto downclocking does a better job and is easier."
overclocking,3e22hr,jbourne0129,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:28:02 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot for all of the information. Manual with C-states works as specified and seems to be more effective than adaptive voltage.
overclocking,3e22hr,jbourne0129,2,Tue Jul 21 23:36:16 2015 UTC,"Check your VIN4 voltage in HWmonitor. Some asus boards are known to report the vore voltage differently. I had this issue for a while and was reading the VID which caused me a lot of confusion. Once I started referencing the VIN4 voltage, it all made sense.  I also checked CPU-Z which reported the 'core voltage' exactly the same as HWmonitor VID...so for me, both were incorrect readings."
overclocking,3e22hr,jbourne0129,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:12:19 2015 UTC,"VIN4 reports the same as VCORE in HWInfo. Oddly, it's even higher than the VID in HWMonitor, and Core Voltage in CPU-Z. I have two screenshots showing the anomaly:  Stress Test: https://i.imgur.com/Gsbyod6.jpg Gaming: https://i.imgur.com/DyXnVnA.png  This is with Adaptive Voltage @ 1.216v and a (-)0.035v offset."
overclocking,3e22hr,jbourne0129,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:41 2015 UTC,"well...im pretty lost on what to tell you. Because the VIN4 looks pretty damn close as well. Couple of things.   Why are you trying to use adaptive voltage? if it is so the voltage will change at different clock speeds (as in, it will lower the voltage at idle) you can achieve the same thing with better results using intel C-States The difference between what your setting for offset and what the readings are could be due to load line calibration. This setting will automatically apply higher voltages as the mobo sees necessary to increase stability. Regardless if using offset, or manual voltage, you should try and turn this off or turn it to the lowest setting use manual voltage, i started with offset and it 1) never worked how i wanted it to, and 2) can result in some pretty funky voltages (as you have seen)   After you set your voltage to manual, check your voltages in the monitoring programs you have. VID (as explained to me) for Asus boards, is bassically what is set in the bios, NOT what is being applied at any given moment. Its like an instruction for the bios to follow. You set manual to 1.20...VID=1.20...you set voltage offset at 1.20 +.02v...VID=1.20-1.22 (in a perfect world..which this isn't as we have seen). Again, this is just how it was explained to me for Asus boards. IF VIN4 is your true core voltage, and you set it to 1.20 then you should see the voltage vary from some really low idle voltage, below 1v to a maximum of exactly what you set in the bios."
overclocking,3e22hr,jbourne0129,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:01:16 2015 UTC,"I was attempting to use adaptive voltage to take advantage of the power saving and CPU health benefits, while also avoiding having to manually setup any power management. My Load Line Calibration was set at Level 8, it'll only go down to Level 1, which I seem to be stable with. After some research regarding LLC, this should have been the cause of my problem. I'll have to run some testing later to see if it's more efficient with its overvolting.  As for swapping to manual voltage, my voltage still remains constant. I have C-states set to Auto, should I manually enable and configure them? Once it's setup, is 1.216v with a +0.014v offset (=1.230v) a good/safe voltage for a 24/7 4.7GHz clock?
