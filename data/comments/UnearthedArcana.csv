I understand you want to flavor it towards darkness, but I personally would just say you can cast Misty Step once per rest (paraphrasing of course).

UnearthedArcana,3e4vtv,Carsonica,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:33:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for reading. I'm going to give it some revision.
UnearthedArcana,3e4vtv,the_singular_anyone,2,Wed Jul 22 13:24:55 2015 UTC,"Gave it a good peruse, like the general idea. Here's my thoughts:  Spell List - Both silent image and arcane eye are attainable from warlock invocations. This is okay, as the invocations still allow you to cast them at-will without a spell slot, but it's still something you should know and maybe think twice about.   Spiteful Shadows - You should maybe think on this ability a bit, based on what it does. Fey Presence keeps the targets within two squares of you from attacking you for a turn, but they're free to attack others. In combat, it's a get-the-mobs-off-me power. Spiteful Shadows keeps the targets within two squares of you from attacking anyone for a turn -  if the fear goes off, they can't do shit but run. If you limited this to one target, it might be more balanced.  Shadow Step - This really needs to be different. Making it exactly the same does zero for flavor, and makes the pact less enjoyable for not being distinct.   Fearful Gaze - Does anything happen when the target is immune to fear? Lots of targets with fear effects are immune to fear, like pretty much any big dragon.   Nightmarish Visions - Is basically a slightly-better Dark Delirium, because you get a shot at group-ganking the target at the end of it. You might want to redesign this.   As it stands, this is very close to a straight refluff of the Archfey pact with a changed up spell list. The abilities are essentially (or, in one case, exactly) the same; Spiteful is intended to be functionally similar to Fey Presence, Shadow Step is identical, Fearful trades up countercharm for counterfear, and Nightmarish is a buffed version of what Archfey already had.   I appreciate your dedication to balance and think it's something vastly underrepresented in the homebrew community, but you may want to go and experiment a bit with what you can do, and compare it to the parameters available pacts give rather than rigorously adhering to the structure of whichever pact was closest to what you want to do anyway.   Intended as constructive criticism and not trying to be a dick. I hope it's helpful."
UnearthedArcana,3e4vtv,Bronze_Johnson,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:41:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for reading! I've got a few ideas. Some of the features will change more than others.
UnearthedArcana,3e1x9x,JowyAtreidesBlight,3,Tue Jul 21 09:23:25 2015 UTC,So I had no idea what Oneiromancy was so I looked it up and it is seeing into the future. So I read the Divination arcane tradition and it is pretty similar. If  you want them to literally see into the future and have to interpret what they see I would replace Expert Divination and replace it with what you want. I would go with something like this...  Future Sight:  Beginning at level 6 you begin to get glimpses of the future in your dreams. Each night that you take a long rest you have a chance get a glimpse into the future. Make a DC10 intelligence check and upon passing you remember your dream and on a failed save you forget your dream. The dream shows a glimpse into the future but you cannot always understand what that dream means. At the DM's discretion set a DC based on the difficulty to discern the meaning of the dream. Make an Insight check and you learn the meaning of the dream. If you fail the check you learn nothing and are left with no insights into what is going on.
UnearthedArcana,3e1x9x,niXx3n,3,Tue Jul 21 12:18:53 2015 UTC,"The divination wizard archetype can be easily refluffed to being based on dreams.  ""Refluffing"" means you change how you describe a feature, while leaving the rules and numbers the same.  Most DMs are more open to refluffing than homebrew, since there are absolutely no ballance concerns and it tends to make things more interesting."

UnearthedArcana,3dzuuc,Carsonica,3,Mon Jul 20 21:38:34 2015 UTC,"I really like it on a quick overview, and I would add some flavor to the blood oath to make it more like having a muse. What comes to mind is an order of warrior bards who serve worthy, honorable heroes and create their legends. I see it less as a general and more as an honor guard. Tactically, it makes very little sense for the leader to be put in harms way regardless of how honorable that seems."
UnearthedArcana,3dzuuc,ButSeriouslyBacon,3,Tue Jul 21 05:19:59 2015 UTC,"I think the flavour is off, and it feels really disjointed because of that. This fits more in with a Paladin who is about their oaths and duties (sworn as a body guard).  A Bard at it's very bases is just as about knowledge as Wizards are. Instead of the theoretical bits of magic, they focus on practical knowledge (lockpicking), people (smooth talking) and the keeping of legends and lore (recounting). Perhaps the knowledge of all life has to offer from the more enjoyment seeking types.  If you're looking for a protective version of the bard, a made up example off the top of my head is ""The Collage of Mourning"". They're about recounting the stories of great sorrows so that they are not repeated, and easing the pain of the about to be departed."
UnearthedArcana,3dzuuc,Everspace,2,Tue Jul 21 08:05:43 2015 UTC,"I would disagree with that statement. The way I see this is a person not bound by the law and his oaths, but rather just his own set of morals, whatever they might be. The College of Sacrifice bard isn't helping others for an oath, he helps because they're his comrades and he has a sense of bonding. While it could be reflavored into a paladin, I still like it as it is. The other reason I made this a bard college is I really feel like bards need more college options. Feel free to re-skin it if you don't agree."

That's fine, but doesn't stop this from not feeling very bardic.  How does this fit beside the singers of glorious battles of the past and the keepers of forgotten lore? Find a concept that doesn't feel out of place, and then use that flavour to start dictating how the abilities complement and enhance that idea. Don't try and push the path into a class just because there's room."

I'm imagining a bullywug character whose ancestral lagoon has dried up due to drought. They hope to find someplace untouched by this peculiar dry spell to deposit their spawn, whom they carry on their back in a barrel.  Or perhaps a couple players might play a pair of bullywug who have been hired by the party to help escort them through a sprawling, ever shifting swamp. Locals know that the swamp is lousy with sinkholes and patches of ""bad air,"" but they advise that the real threat is in the zealous communities of hyper-religious bullywug who live there. Hopefully they will be more forgiving of parties who have bullywug allies."
UnearthedArcana,3dzqzo,Sad-Crow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:43:56 2015 UTC,Flavor can easily be reskinned on existing race. My personal thought is that if youre going to create a different race they should bring some new mechanics or combination of mechanics to the party.  Luckily DND is an open ended game.
UnearthedArcana,3dzqzo,Lord_of_Hydras,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:06:19 2015 UTC,"I'd drop the walking speed to 25ft to keep it a bit more in line with other ""slow"" races. The base Bullywug monster has a slow walking speed and a fast swimming speed. I think doing something similar to the Aarakocra might be a good plan. Bump up the swimming speed to 40ft to compensate for the slower walking speed.  Otherwise, the race appears to be just on the weak side of average. It has a swim speed, can breath underwater, and an alright leap, but that's all it really has going for it. Water environments, especially swamps, aren't generally all that common in campaigns. This means that the Bullywug doesn't really do anything special most of the time. He's only going to get use of his stats and, occasionally, his leap.  It might be breaking away from the base monster, but I'd consider adding some unique power to this race. Maybe it gets the Poison Spray cantrip for free at first level and a couple of swamp-style utility spells as the character levels up. Poison spray is cool, but not exactly game breaking. A couple of ""once per long rest"" utility spells will come in handy, but shouldn't push the race into crazy power levels. If it does, consider reducing the base Dex by 1 to tone it down a bit."
UnearthedArcana,3dzqzo,Slashlight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:22:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. When I was doing this I was trying to make sure they weren't overpowered. (In my mind, I'd rather they be underpowered and I get to add something instead of the opposite.) In the initial stage I had thought about giving them a cantrip, but I don't remember why I nixed it... I'm assuming you're talking about something akin to the drow's Drow Magic. Here's a first stab: Bullywug Venin: You know the poison spray cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the detect poison and disease spell once per day. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the protection from poison spell once per day. Wisdom is your spellcasling abilily for these spells."
UnearthedArcana,3dzqzo,Slashlight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:08:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, something like that adds a bit more ""oomph"" to the race without making it too powerful. It maintains the flavor of the Bullywug being swamp creatures, too, as they're more likely to know quite a bit about poisons and be best suited to protect themselves and others against them."
UnearthedArcana,3dtb3a,Level9Zubat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:31:29 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, there is nothing stand out as OP in this at all, in fact, it seems quite well balanced.  I'll be opening it up to my players as an optional class.    The only thing I cant figure out is if this is supposed to be an up close caster or not.  Most of its abilities and spells are <30' it seems. If it is supposed to be an up close caster, it seems very very squishy with only a d8 and essentially no armor, especially if you are on the paths that give abilities when not wearing armor (air being the stand out).  Perhaps a boost to base AC when not wearing armor would be needed, but I'm not 100% certain on that.  I may just be thinking of it incorrectly.  Perhaps the reaction for disadvantage at level 1 is enough, but I'm just not sure."
UnearthedArcana,3dtb3a,Da_Chief99,2,Tue Jul 21 19:42:19 2015 UTC,"They are indeed a close range Caster, and they have access to Unarmored Defense (which is technically better than Mage Armor if they don't use a shield) to boost their AC.

UnearthedArcana,3drekc,EnormousDwarf,2,Sat Jul 18 18:56:08 2015 UTC,"I felt that 5e gave little-to-no space for necromancers. The wizard school of necromancy has very little to do with raising the dead. One key goal while making this was not to break the action economy. Please let me know what you think, and how balanced you find this to be in comparison to other schools."
UnearthedArcana,3drekc,cr5ashland,2,Sat Jul 18 18:59:38 2015 UTC,"I love it, definitely a more classic necromancer vibe. Big question I have is what CR would you calculate a PC at for raising the dead? Also when a spell slot has been used to raise a minion, can that slot be refreshed over a rest or is it considered expended until the creature dies / is released. Finally my two cents is if you make the creature unable to make basic judgment calls, it puts the raise dead ability more in line with the summoning spells they introduced in one of the free updates (dont recall which atm) with the being risk tied to the spell. Example being don't allow the undead to differentiate friend or foe, just allow them an ""attack"" command and have them keep attacking the nearest target or an ""attack target"" in which they attack a chosen target and then idle until another command is given. This makes managing more zombies become a much more tactical task and more action intensive to manage efficiently.  Sorry for the novel  TLDR: I love this and have been thinking about how awesome this is all night"
UnearthedArcana,3drekc,OrkishBlade,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:27:58 2015 UTC,"What CR is a PC: This is a great question that I really have not considered. A method I can come up with is like this: Take the PC level. The DMG has a table on page 82 for xp thresholds. Using the ""Medium"" encounter difficulty, find the xp and determine what CR would grant that xp. For example, a medium encounter has a threshold xp at 1,200 for a level 10 PC. CR 5 monster give 1,800 xp and CR 4 monsters give 1,100. So as a DM I would probably place him as a CR 4.  When a spell slot is bound to a minion slot it is considered ""used up"" and cannot be used. During a long rest you may choose to release a spell slot from a minion slot and regain your original spell slot. If the minion is under your command while you take this rest it would die.  About your ""two cents"", that is exactly the intention. The necromancer would command his minions ""Attack the orcs"" or ""Attack the big orc"" or ""Protect Rodrick the Dwarf"". If the necromancer just says ""attack"", the DM could be mean and have the minions attack the party or even the necromancer himself.  EDIT: Regarding the first paragraph about the CR of PCs. The method works kind of. At level 10, a necromancer has 5th level spell slots that can be used to raise minions with CR 1. For the necromancer to raise his dead buddy he would need to lug around his body until he gets to level 13, where he unlocks 7th level spell slots capable of raising minions with CR 4. Alas, I would change the encounter difficulty to ""hard"" or ""deadly"" to make it a little bit harder to raise fellow PCs. A level 13 having a level 10 as a minion seems really strong. Using hard encounter threshold you would need an 8th level slot (unlocked at level 15) and using deadly you would need a 9th level slot (Unlocked at level 17). Since this is so specific I would leave it to the DM to choose the CR of the PC, probably using either ""hard"" or ""deadly"" as encounter difficulties."
UnearthedArcana,3drekc,ENTlightened,2,Sun Jul 19 01:37:55 2015 UTC,"The idea is bold, and necessary for proper necromantic awesomeness.

UnearthedArcana,3drekc,Alkapwn21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:09:22 2015 UTC,There's always one of those... ;-)
UnearthedArcana,3drekc,Alkapwn21,2,Tue Jul 21 22:04:30 2015 UTC,"I like this a lot.  It's a move in the right direction, I think, and allows you to have the minion-mancer feel at level 2, rather than waiting until level 5 (which, for many campaigns, isn't for a while, and around where many games end).  That being said, I do feel as though this is overpowered.  I like the idea of using a spell slot for each minion, and I was at first worried that the number of minions you can have may be too many, but then I realized you can't even get a regular skeleton until level 5, which seems fair.  Now, for sake of clarification, how exactly do you intend for controlling them to work?  As it reads, it sounds like you could use a bonus action to command them to ""attack that enemy"" and they would do so until the enemy is dead.  Is the one command your intention?  If so, I would suggest modeling it more after the Beastmaster, wherein you have to use your action each turn to command them.  This would likely help not break the action economy (so I couldn't command five minions to attack and also cast a fireball spell in the same round).  Can you use the Raising or Healing Minion abilities over the course of a short rest?  Can skeletons use elemental attacks?  I like the idea of a skeleton dragon spewing a cold or necrotic breath weapon, but since it doesn't have the anatomy for it anymore, is it possible?  I think the Swords of Death ability is overpowered.  At level 6, you're adding an extra 5d4 damage each turn.  I think having the attacks counting as magical is enough for the level 6 ability.  Also, does does this benefit apply when the minion is wielding a manufactured weapon?  Necrotic Mark seems unnecessary as well.  Take all of this with a grain of salt; I'm no expert and I don't claim to be.  This is all coming from a guy with a moderate amount of casual experience.  Keep up the good work!"
UnearthedArcana,3drekc,ClaraOswinOswalt,3,Sun Jul 19 00:49:04 2015 UTC,"Controlling them takes a bonus action, and I will explain why that is not as powerful as it may seem. Let us examine a 6th level necromancer versus a 6th level evocation wizard. At 6th level our necromancer has at most 4 minions to command, assuming at level 4 he put his +2 into intelligence. If he uses all of those minions up, he takes away 4 of his 10 spell slots. Having a crawling hand at your side at 6th level is entirely meaningless, so the necromancer must use a high level slot for his minion to be meaningful in combat. This effectively lags him significantly behind the other wizard, who at level 6 can cast a powerful spell like fireball three times.  That is exactly the balance here. Sure, the necromancer can command his minions and cast spells. But in order for his minions to be meaningful he must sacrifice the use of his more powerful spell slots, taking away a lot from his spellcasting capabilities.  The PHB says that during a short rest PCs eat, drink, read, and tend to wounds. If the necromancer wishes to raise minions or cure his current ones he cannot do this during a short rest.  Skeletons using elemental attacks is entirely up to the DM.  There is merit to your comment about Swords of Death dealing 5d4. What you ought to keep in mind is that this is the necromancers primary method of attack. His spells are much weaker compared to other wizards. This extra damage is his only way of not lagging too much behind his fellow casters.  Necrotic mark I also had an iffy feeling about. I didn't get to try a playtest it yet, so I have no comments on its usefulness. It was designed to sync with Swords of Death and The Angry Dead.  EDIT: All that being said I really want to balance this and am taking your thoughts into consideration."
UnearthedArcana,3drekc,AFuryOfOwls,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:56:42 2015 UTC,"Alright, so I've looked at the PHB a bit, and I am convinced about the controlling part, because it's pretty on par with the Animate Dead spell.  I mis-remembered its mechanics.  Additionally, while I am not entirely convinced about the Swords of Death ability, I am seeing now that part of the 6th level PHB Necromancer ability is adding your proficiency bonus to your undeads' attacks, which makes me feel more at ease about it. My thought process behind this was, if you're interested, that you were comparing Necromancer damage to Evoker damage.  Evokers are meant to blow things up, whereas the Necromancer had the added benefit of a non-meat shield and free labor for life.  My next suggestion would be to consider a limit on the number of times you can use ""The Angry Dead"" abilities.  As it is, for example, you could simply use ""Strike of the Dead"" on all of your minions at the beginning of your day and refresh it after each battle, which is a lot of free damage.  Infinite ""Death Shrieks"" seems abusable as well, depending on the number of encounters per day (or how much fun you wanted to have walking through a heavily-populated city).  Perhaps three or four uses (used however the player sees fit in any combination from your list) would be appropriate?  Hope this helps! This is definitely a necromancer I would want to play!"

I'd also cut the Arcane Proficancy from the spell book, esspeically the expertise part - having double prof in a skill is WAY better than prof in two different skills and players WILL pick a background with Arcana in it to absue this. I'd just give them flat proficiency in Arcana with the option to take another Sorcerer class skill if their background already grants it.  I think a casting time restriction on rituals really doesn't make any difference as well since you generally don't use them in combat anyway.

UnearthedArcana,3dpj0f,Pixie1001,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:52:16 2015 UTC,"This looks kinda cool, although the 18th level ability could get a little out of control (It lets you spent spell points to collect yet more spell points).     The 18th level ability definitely needs some tweaking, but unless I'm missing something, it doesn't actually give you infinite Sorcery Points. It only activates on spells above 3rd level, and all the spells that you can cast with just Sorcery Points (using the 14th level ability) are 3rd level or lower, as they have to be from your favored school. So you can cast a 6th level spell and gain enough SP to cast two spell-slot-free 3rd level favored school spells, but those spells don't refund any SP. Meanwhile, you can use SP to create spell-slots, but there's a hefty loss when doing so (the 6-point refund from a 6th level spell only allows you to make at-maximum one 4th level slot). However, I will be taking a further look into the ability, and if you caught some exploit that I didn't (which is pretty likely, knowing me), I'd love to hear it!        I'd also cut the Arcane Proficancy from the spell book, esspeically the expertise part - having double prof in a skill is WAY better than prof in two different skills and players WILL pick a background with Arcana in it to absue this.     I can see your point. I suppose I just wanted to make the spellbook a really cool thing, but now I see the problem with allowing Adept Sorcerers to have expertise in Arcana when even actual Wizards can't (unless they take some Bard levels...). I'll change it to be what you suggested, and take another look at it later.        I think a casting time restriction on rituals really doesn't make any difference as well since you generally don't use them in combat anyway. If you want to keep this feature as a Ribbon I'd set it so you can only learn 1 or 2 spells as rituals, and no more.     The casting time restriction was mainly for thematic reasons. I envisioned a Sorcerer sitting in front of their spellbook, messily mis-pronouncing words and sort of frowning confusedly at some of their scribbled writing. They can cast rituals, but man is it a struggle. Meanwhile, I'm unsure about limiting how many ritual spells they can cast (further than the favored school spell limit does already). One issue with this ability (and a key reason why I wanted it to be a ribbon) is that, depending on what favored school you pick, you might get nothing from this. I mean, sure, if you picked Divination, you might be able to pick nothing but Ritual spells for your favored school feature. But pick Evocation, Enchantment, Transmutation, or Necromancy? You get practically nothing. So that's why I figured I'd let the Divination Adepts go nuts (because Divination has always been a weak school).    However, in looking at spells to answer the above point... I've realized that this ""ribbon"" really does do nothing for around half of the eight schools. Then, out of the remaining four, only Divination and Illusion really get many choices, which leaves Abjuration, Enchantment, Conjuration, Evocation, Necromancy, and Transmutation Adepts out in the cold. I'm considering changing this because of that fact, or perhaps adding a second facet to the ribbon that will do something cool for those schools. Any ideas?       EDIT: Oh, and thanks for the great feedback! I really appreciate it :)"
UnearthedArcana,3dpj0f,Pixie1001,2,Sat Jul 18 16:45:59 2015 UTC,"And it looks like you've done the math on the 18th level ability - I'll admit I'm not all that familiar with the Sorcery point system, so I'll take your word for it.  Ok, so looking over the Sorcerer spell list I realise they only have like 3 spells they could use through this feature - all of which are pretty terrible. I might have missed a claus about the feature only working on spells granted by the Archetype as well since you seem to be implying that through your comment. So I guess it's probably fine as is then.  If your worried about it being to limited and shoe horning players into taking schools that work better with it you could just give them detect magic at-will or something instead. Alternatively you could let them use the sorcerer Rituals with it as well without having to learn them as Sorcerery spells. I think they include Water Walking, Water Breathing and Detect Magic - nothing that would break the game.  It looks like you've mostly thought a lot of this throigh though - I look forward to seeing what you think up next :)"

UnearthedArcana,3dklkb,Zetesofos,2,Fri Jul 17 00:56:39 2015 UTC,"Some feedback:  Bonus proficiencies: This is fine.  The cantrip early is a nice touch.  Harmonic verse: I like this as well.  the   Automatic success on concentration is pretty insanely powerful.  Really the purpose of concentration in 5e is a giant way to balance certain spells and negating it entirely is insane.  Change this to granting advantage on concentration checks and it is still a significant improvement on a rarely used ability but still workable.  Magical Inspiration - Seems like this leads to infinite inspiration dice (which you've already buffed).  Turns will consist of bonus action to give a die, cast a spell to gain a die.  You have a pool of you Cha mod in dice worth of turns every combat to take actions other than cast a spell, which likely won't be happening.  (also a small typo, bards only get Cha mod of dice, not Cha+1)  Now I'm not sure what to add in it's stead, my only direction is to take a look at the two other colleges features and find something similarly powerful (Lore gets to use dice on their own ability checks, which wont happen often because cutting words is amazing.  Alternatively they can already buff their allies in such a manor.  Valor gets an extra offhand attack when casting a spell as an action.  Both of these are what I would neat, kind of interesting abilities, but not great.  You should find an ability that makes the player say ""oh that's neat, i can see some places where I could use that and just a few situations were it might be extra helpful.""  if you find something that you want to use all the time then it's far too powerful for a level 14 bardic college ability)  College of Truth  Bonus Proficiencies: I like this.  It give interesting choices  Final Proclamation: this is good too, it's nice and balanced.  Words of Power: I'm not a huge fan of this.  bards can already grab eldritch blast and hex which lets them do the single thing that warlocks are designed around doing almost as good as them.  Giving them agonizing spear as well means that any College of Truth Bard is better at the one and only thing that warlocks are good at.  Add a cavaet that this ability only works once per cantrip and I'm sold; otherwise every warlock should reroll as a college of truth bard.  True Name: this seems like a really neat level 14 ability.  I would suggest the caveat that any damage you or your allies deals to the creature immediately cancels the effect.  All in all these seem like some interesting additions.  I hope this helps!"
UnearthedArcana,3dklkb,techiesgoboom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:01:12 2015 UTC,"Spellsong - The reason I think I did automatic success is because you do have to spend your whole action to do the effect, which means giving up any other attacks and casting most spells.  I was also worried that it would be too similar to the warcasting feat  Magical Inspiration - Keep in mind that at this level, a bard is getting inspiration dice back every SHORT rest, so every bard already has an unlimited number of uses - if a player wants to burn a spellslot just for the inspiration die outside of combat, that seems fair to me; otherwise people who use their spells sparringly won't see the effect play out - remember that the inspiration die itself only lasts for 10 minutes, so they can't put one on their party for the whole day.    Words of Power - I did consider this, but ultimately there are a few other classes that boost cantrips, and this problem is more with eldritch blast than anything else.  At present, a bard can take a level dip into warlock to get roughly the same effect; if it's too powerful for the warlock, it's too powerful for everyone else in my mind.    edit: I did have another thought though - rather than just cantrips, how about just Cha to any Thunder or Psychic damage spell - eliminates eldritch blast problem and also allows it's use on a few other bard spells, namely enchantments and spells like shatter."
UnearthedArcana,3dklkb,techiesgoboom,2,Fri Jul 17 12:42:04 2015 UTC,"I understand your wanting to make spellsong stand out but the point still is is that making everyone automatically succeed on concentration checks is nearly game breaking.  The existence of concentration checks is a very important feature to these spells; it gives enemies a chance to try to interrupt some of the most controlling effects in the game.  All you need to do is get your heat metal off, your cleric to get a bless off, and your wizard to throw a hold down and you can faceroll things with very little counter from the enemies.  And don't worry about any sort of similarity to war caster.  1) sacrificing balance is no reason to buff an ability 2) there's a reason war caster only grants advantage 3) there are already exist plenty of game features that grant a partial feat to just the pc taking it.  Taking an action to grant a partial benefit you everyone around you is pretty significantly different and 4) Because of the way advantage/disadvantage works things are going to have a tendency to sometimes look a little similar.  Any time you want to grant a mechanical benefit (or detriment) to an ability, you just slap one of these labels on it and walk away.  Magical inspiration - 5e is designed around 6 encounters a day with two short rests in between and a long rest at the end.  As such a bard at 14 (who likely has 20 cha at this time) has 15 uses of bardic inspiration at a time.  You are increasing that number to 32.  Not just that but the bard can selectively boost the number available for a single encounter to 22 if he needs and if it drags out long enough.  This is very significant.  And sure they can't load the inspiration die onto their friends in advance but it still means 100% of their bonus actions will be handing out inspiration dice.  My other main point is compare this ability to other colleges level 14 abilities.  This is severely out of line with the power of the rest of them.  if you really like the idea of extra spell slots being paired with spells than I would suggest trying it to the casting a 5th level spell or higher.  Now any good bard is going to be casting a spell every turn at this level in combat so getting a die a turn doesn't leave them with options.  If instead it only happens with high level spells then the bard actually has an interesting choice to make.  now while this is still a good ability, and still a healthy improvement on what the other archetypes offer at this level, it's a lot closer to maintaining balance.  Words of Power;     if it's too powerful for the warlock, it's too powerful for everyone else in my mind.   This is not the way balance works.  A fighter get 4 attacks; that's good.  Give it to a paladin (the highest burst damage available) and it's gamebreaking.  What works for one class doesn't necessarily work for another.  Warlocks are kind of the fighters of casting.  They can blast every single turn for nice, reliable damage but only have access to a few spells per encounter to do things with (not to mention a limited spell list) .  other casters blast for lower damage but have more versatility with more spells to really swing things quickly.  Giving a class both is not a great idea.  And while yes, they can dip 2 levels into warlock to grab that invocation, that can be fine if the player has to work for it like that; because if they are dipping into warlock like that they won't be able to also dip into fighter for the action surge, etc.  Now a very simple fix to words of power (especially in that you consider it a problem with eldritch blast) is to simply specifically state that you apply this ability once per casting, similar to how the similar ability works for scorching rays.  This way the spell works exactly as you intended it with the added benefit of not breaking when used with eldritch blast.  it also falls in line with the few other classes that boost cantrips that you mentioned."
UnearthedArcana,3dklkb,techiesgoboom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:49:48 2015 UTC,Spellsong. Fair enough that makes good sense.  Magical inspiration. Also fair point. What about sacrificing spell slots to grant inspiration without using base pool? Even have it so that you can target multiple allies with higher level spell slots.  Words of power. See edit
UnearthedArcana,3dklkb,techiesgoboom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:59:05 2015 UTC,"Magical inspiration: I thought about that, and while it could be balanced (although it would have to target a number at 1/2 spell level rounded down or 1/3, or something similar.  Basically a 4th level spell slot should very much not buff the whole party) it just doesn't feel right, you know?  Words of power - the text of magical secrets specifically states that these gained spells become bard spells, so the edit doesnt work.  Use the text for the errata on the wizards empowered evocation ""The damage bonus applies to one damage roll of a spell, not multiple rolls""  Lastly, something I forgot to mention before, is that not requiring any verbal components for spells is incredibly strong.  From a flavor perspective as well this simply doesn't work.  This archetype is all about gaining hidden knowledge, learning deep dark secrets.  This (along with the extra damage from the ability) really seem to imply some hidden language tied in more closely with magic than normal; almost as if the caster is making some deep, dark, old utterance that just resonates with magic and power.  Kinda like overtone singing.  if anything I imagine this being louder or at least deeper (although that wouldn't change anything mechanically)  This ability is good on it's own.  It works great as a low level ability.  Giving it something so good and out of place seems odd.  (this is one of those times when what works for one class wouldn't work another.  Bards are the only class to get silence as a spell.  They don't get any non-concentration, non-thunder damage useful combat spells until level 15 unless they grab one as a secret.  There's a balance reason for this; allowing them to both cast silence and hurt the enemies inside it is really powerful; so it's difficult and comes at a cost.  Allowing bards to cast silence on themselves and be unaffected is a really huge things.  Now if you took silence off of the bard spell list it wouldn't be so crazy or if another class had it it wouldn't either.  But not needing vocal components at all just doesn't fit mechanically or thematically."
UnearthedArcana,3dklkb,Omega_Advocate,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:24:02 2015 UTC,"So spellsong i can change then to advantage on those checks.   For magical inspiration im thinking you can grant an inspiration die for every 2 spell levels (min 2nd level) you sacrifice.  For words of power, that might be a typo, i meant somatic components (i.e. no gestures, just voice).   Ill take a look at the errata, but if the damage only applies to thunder or psyxhic damage how does that effect eldritch blast?"

UnearthedArcana,3dgdhu,Lord_of_Hydras,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:12:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, that's a good point. I was thinking it was a chance to take something that gave fewer hard mechanical benefits (like mask of many faces) that I had wanted to take when I played a warlock, but didn't. Do you think it's worth giving specific invocations or maybe even calling it something else that provides similar benefits?"
UnearthedArcana,3dgdhu,the_singular_anyone,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:09:07 2015 UTC,"Contagion is a really really broken thing to give a warlock to use with their spell slots. Any warlock can really easily start a plague anywhere by bapping people with it until they run out of slots, waiting an hour, and then doing it over and over again.   Weeping Wounds - not all warlocks will take Inflict Wounds - notably, a Tome 'lock would likely be at a severe disadvantage using that spell. Having a level 1 feature that hinges on the character having a particular spell presented as optional isn't something that any other warlock pact does. As far as balance goes, it's just fine though - maybe hinge it off of an attack (both spell and melee may apply), which everyone is guaranteed to have?  Invocation of Scars - unorthodox, but I like it. Makes the warlock very versatile, but they can't really do anything outside of what a warlock could already do. My only small quibble is that 8 hp will quickly be forgotten as the warlock levels up, and will likely be healed away first thing in the morning with hit dice - maybe something like taking 1d8 + Warlock Level in damage, which could at least eat up a couple hit die and be a detriment far down the line?  Coagulate - Level 10 pact features are universally defensive, and this one grants a minion, which makes this pact more offensive and less defensive than any other pact. But the real problem comes from the Death Saving Throw mechanic, because creatures never make death saving throws, and only PCs ever do. This is a problem because it essentially encourages you to actively teamkill to get a little minion you can throw at folks. Hurting your friends for advantages this far isn't a 5e mechanic, and it's that way for a good reason.  Blood Stride - You can use this one any time you meet the criteria, forever, which is something only the really wacky Create Thrall does at the same level. That said, I don't see much problem with it, other than it seems designed to deposit a ranged Tome 'lock right next to an angry monster. Maybe make the damage done either on the creature you're entering or on the creature you're exiting, so a Tome 'lock could jump into a monster, hurt it, and exit through an ally at range?"
UnearthedArcana,3dgdhu,the_singular_anyone,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:46:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this is really helpful.  Weeping Wounds -- This is a really good point. I hadn't thought about that. You're absolutely right. I was trying to keep it from being crazy overpowered by forcing use of a slot, and encouraging taking Inflict Wounds for flavor. What do you think about changing it to Eldritch Blast? Do you think it would be fair to say ""You may use this feature a number of times equal to your charisma modifier. After that, you must take a long rest before using this feature again""?  Invocation of Scars -- This should say permeant HP damage, that was my bad. Do you think it still needs the further 8+Lock Level?  I'm thinking about switching Blood Stride and Coagulate level-wise. Would that make more sense?  Coagulate -- So, I'll straight up get rid of the Death Save mechanic. I don't usually think of ways to teamkill, so that never really occurred to me. I was thinking for NPC types.  Blood Stride -- I intended for the player to have the option of doing damage so they could run away without worrying about hurting their allies. That may not come across with my current wording? I think I will add in the option to damage upon entry. I had thought about putting a limitation on it, but nothing felt quite right.  As far as contagion goes, I don't read the spell as creating a disease with an actual vector of transmission. While a Warlock could potentially create a small plague 12 cases a day (by my ruling, any hour you engage in spell casting/fighting you can't get a rest until the next ""hour."" Basically, I'm not going to play the how many spell slots can I eek out optimization game.) Maybe up to 48 if you're a super generous DM... so you could definitely create a scare, but you'd be pouring a lot of resources into something that might not be very effective. Failing 3 saving throws is fairly difficult. Do you read the spell differently?"
UnearthedArcana,3dgdhu,TotesMessenger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:44:42 2015 UTC,"Weeping Wounds  What do you think about changing it to Eldritch Blast?   Would shaft Blade 'locks. If you make it operate off just ""an attack,"" then EB will still work because it is a ""spell attack"" as will your pact weapon, which of course makes a melee attack.    You may use this feature a number of times equal to your charisma modifier. After that, you must take a long rest before using this feature again   That sounds just fine.   Invocation of Scars  This should say permeant HP damage, that was my bad. Do you think it still needs the further 8+Lock Level?   Ah, you mean to use the phrase ""Maximum HP decreases by..."" rather than say ""damage"". It shouldn't be 8+Lock Level, but it should definitely be more than flat 8.   I'd say in this case that lowering your max HP by 1d8 + your proficiency mod would be reasonable, scale with level, and not be too punishing.    Coagulate  I don't usually think of ways to teamkill, so that never really occurred to me. I was thinking for NPC types.   Yeah, I thought that was what you were trying to go for, but NPCs never make death saves without a DM flubbing the rules, so Coagulate really only has one, very-team-kill-y, use.   Of all your pact, this is probably what could use the most work. You may want to rework it into a defensive feature such that, when you are damaged, you can take an extra 1d10 damage and summon a blood minion from yourself. It'd be similar to other level 10 features in that it affects the way you get hit, and it'd be thematic with the pact in that it'd hurt you more to make more blood stuff happen.    Blood Stride  I intended for the player to have the option of doing damage so they could run away without worrying about hurting their allies.   Ah okay that totally works if that's what you were planning. Honestly the 500-foot as-an-action teleport between two creatures is worth it even without the damage.    Contagion   I don't read the spell as creating a disease with an actual vector of transmission   So, wait. The spell is named Contagion, and the disease it creates is not actually contagious. The fuck.  Well, your reading is right, but that makes no clear logical sense. In any case you have to be careful with warlock spells that have a duration of >1 hour because locks can just stack them right and left. The only spell that breaks this that comes to mind (outside of invocations) is Hallow in the Fiend spell list, which I guess occupies a similar enough niche.   Okay, Contagion gets a pass.  I'd take a look at Anti-Life Shell, which now just occurred to me might be a problem. It has a duration of only 1 hour, which is fine, but when it is up (and because of warlock spell slots, it can be up every combat), you're literally immune to melee attacks. Nothing melee can touch you - no save, no disadvantage, just straight up no-touching - which is almost guaranteed to trivialize some encounters if you are able to have it up roughly every encounter.   There aren't an abundance of 5th level spell choices for warlocks, but I'd still steer clear of Anti-Life Shell, if possible."
UnearthedArcana,3dez4t,zepplinsbass,4,Wed Jul 15 19:18:26 2015 UTC,"First bit to note, ""sanguine"" isn't a fancy term for ""blood"". It means ""blood red"". You could try ""hemomancy"", but it sounds a bit odd.  As for the archetype itself...  This is too complex to be an ""archetype"". Archetypes don't change or replace a bunch of features. They add on to existing ones. I know you want to add a bunch of ""blood stuff"", but I don't think fundamentally altering the way the sorcerer functions is the way to go about it."
UnearthedArcana,3dez4t,Slashlight,2,Wed Jul 15 21:49:34 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean. So, would you suggest a new class entirely then?  I guess the two problems I kept running into that I tried to avoid were (1) sacrificing hit points means heals can make you unbalanced and/or straight overpowered, and (2) trying to consolidate a system so the player didn't have to keep track of Sorcery Points, Spell Slots, and some other point system to track blood magic."
UnearthedArcana,3dez4t,Slashlight,3,Wed Jul 15 22:29:56 2015 UTC,"Hit Dice offer solid design space. You could allow the sorcerer to spend hit dice as though they were sorcery points.

I used a combination of lore, subclass features, and a new list of sanguimancy spells to try and accomplish this.   Thanks in advance for the help.  [Note 1] Regarding the spell list, the 'spilled blood' aspects and 'fresh blood' requirements in material components are mostly for flavor.

I would change its usage limitation and say ""A creature must complete a long rest before it can be affected by this feature again.""  Third Eye's Vision: It really needs a wording more consistent with the PHB. It also wouldn't hurt to simply the mechanic. ""Upon taking damage, you may expended your reaction to glimpse into your attacker's future. If your attacker targets you with an attack within the next 1 minute, it treats the d20 result as 10 - your charisma modifier (minimum of 1)."" This dodges the awkward situation of disadvantage.

It would be much faster to just say invisible and on the ethereal plane (so all things on the material plane pass through you).   Overwhelming Knowledge: I don't like this feature because it encourages some awkward use. Also, the feature is wasted if the target succeeds on a single saving throw.

Overwhelming Knowledge is the only thing I have a serious problem with. Compare it to the other warlock abilities:  Dark Delirium does one save, then removal indefinitely.  Hurl Through Hell does no save, 1 turn of removal, and 10d10 damage.  Overwhelming Knowledge has a save, does 10 turns of removal-but-allies-can-still-attack, and an eventual 10d10 of damage.   Essentially, anyone Overwhelming Knowledge is cast on will be dogpiled into oblivion. Notice how Dark Delirium breaks the spell if anyone attacks the effected creature? Your poor stunned target of OK gets wailed on for 10 turns with no save and there's not a damn thing they can do about it.   OK is strictly better than DD, because you can attack its target and OK deals HTH damage. OK is also strictly better than HTH, because it has ten times the removal and, as said before, you can attack the enemy while they're in removal.   It's like DD got glued together with HTH with all the strengths of both and only the saving throw as a weakness. It's very overpowered.   Also, you should specify whether or not OK is a concentration effect, and if you can have a concentration spell at the same time as OK. DD requires concentration - OK almost certainly should, too."
UnearthedArcana,3dbnkf,the_singular_anyone,3,Wed Jul 15 08:22:22 2015 UTC,OK actually ends if the affected creature takes damage. Which would mean it never last for more than one round.

UnearthedArcana,3dbnkf,zepplinsbass,2,Wed Jul 15 15:10:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe the Warlock could be incapacitated (or incapacitated and can't move) while concentrating, though still able to end OK early. You could also try decreasing damage or decreasing removal. Personally, I would do something like the first suggestion. I'm a fan of major drawbacks for major power.  Also, on the flavor side, I thought it'd be cool if the affected target permanently gained a piece of random knowledge. That knowledge might even be something about the Warlock, that could be used against the player (additional drawback for OK). Just a thought; by no means a criticism."
UnearthedArcana,3dbnkf,the_singular_anyone,2,Wed Jul 15 17:41:11 2015 UTC,"That's still HTH damage + 10 rounds of removal, even if the damage does take a long time to get there.  Personally, I'd recommend doing 3 rounds of removal with 2d8 per. You'd do almost twice the damage per round but half the damage overall (10d10 has a median of 55, or 5.5 for 1d10, while 2d8 has a median of 9, times 3 for 27). Three rounds of guaranteed removal is still a VERY powerful thing, but it's no one-full-minute to sit around and watch an enemy slowly take maximum damage while you build a campfire or whatever."

UnearthedArcana,3dc0st,DARKX62,2,Wed Jul 15 02:26:33 2015 UTC,"I feel that you can drop the Brainstorm points. Here's why:   Everything seems like it should just be a on long rest recharge anyway.  The singular? spell slot seems to be on a long rest recharge. If it's not, I feel that it should just a one spell slot that works like the Warlock Slot - it's always at its highest level, but like a Wizard Slot, you only use it once per long rest. I wouldn't bother with how many spells known - I would give a minimum like a Wizard, and allow the Factotum to learn spells like a Wizard. They just sort of remember them. If you need to, just grant them a Spellbook and Ritual caster too. Also it needs to cap at max spell level 5. The Lay on hands analogue should probably be on a long rest recharge also. If anything, just make it exactly as Lay on Hands, you gain an HP pool equal to 5 times your Rogue level, it does exactly as Lay on Hand, and the points don't replenish until you finish a long rest. If you want to deal with the class being more of a Mimic, reduce the pool to 5 + Rogue level. Cunning Surge should also probably on long rest recharge also. You can mimic a fighter, but you can't do it over and over again like a fighter.    The only ones I can see that okay for short rest are Insight and Breach. In fact, you should just drop brilliance and incorporate it into Insight, but stagger it for a different level.  Also it's too front loaded. I would like to stagger the levels you get one.  So here's what I would do:  Cunning Insight: at 3rd level, you have a variety of insights and experiences into anything and everything. As a bonus action before rolling an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you may add your Intelligence modifier to the roll. You must finish a rest before you can use this ability again.   (I personally don't think you need to add Int mod to damage, they still have sneak attack dice.)  Dabbler: You like to dabble, dangerously, some might say - one finger into the Arcane, another into Divine, and one more into the Martial. Choose from: Arcane Dilettante, Opportunistic Piety, or Cunning Surge.   (Change the features to be long rest recharge and don't bother with points)  At 9th and 13th level, you gain the benefits from another Dabble of your choice.  Cunning Feint: At 13th level, as a bonus action, any creature within 60 ft of you must succeed an Intelligence Saving Throw or grant advantage to you on your next attack against it. Alternatively, you may add your Intelligence modifier to the next damage roll you make against this creature.  (This doesn't stack with Cunning Insight, but it's an at-will essentially. Also at this point you should a +5 modifier to Int anyway. But Advantage also does a lot more for a Rogue than a straight bonus. This takes the place of Breach.)  The 17th level cap is something I'm not sure what to do with. I don't remember the Factotum too well at 20th level, so I don't know what to suggest.  Anyways, you don't have to take it all to heart, it's a pretty good draft; but those are my suggestions."
UnearthedArcana,3dc0st,Ceiling90,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:57:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the feedback! I have a reply and please know I'm not being defensive and just explaining my thoughts, I really do appreciate the time you put into giving me feedback. Reply:  The idea of the brainstorm points is to have the ability to mimic other classes during battle, but limit it during a fight so you aren't outshining those other classes.  So say you end up in a fight where your fighter is downed.  You would probably want to use that action surge.  But next fight on the same day, your wizard goes down mid fight.  Now you can fill that role.  The idea is that you are able to substitute in a time of need for other classes.   Giving them a spellbook wouldn't be the worst idea, but I was going for a ""I remember that guy doing something like this once"" feel.  So overall I wouldn't mind that.  I don't want the spell casting of this archetype to overshadow arcane trickster or eldritch knight, so max spell level of 5 would be unlikely as those classes can only get to 4.  I tried to give this archetype more of a half progression to that. Lay on hands is limited to a maximum of 5 uses in a day (giving the same healing pool as a paladin at level 20 as long as you have 20 Intelligence) but limiting it by making you choose between just healing like a paladin would for a standard action or getting to use another instance of cunning insight. I tried to balance cunning surge out so it could be used once per short rest but at the cost of over half of your capstone brainstorm points.  Using it prior to level 17 would put you at exhausted/almost exhausted points, making it a hefty choice when in combat.   To the point about damage on cunning insight, I would agree.  I don't think this is necessary.  I feel like this can be moved to breach, as you are passing the defenses of the enemy.  While the dabbler idea isn't a bad one, as I said before I was hoping to make the archetype more of a fill in for roles when they are downed or doing poorly.  This would definitely impede the archetype's ability to do this.  Cunning feint.  I actually like this.  This is almost certainly going to be the new cunning breach.  Great suggestion.  As far as the capstone ability it is my least favorite part of my draft.  I kind of threw it in as a ""oh I can't really think of anything but this makes sense and isn't bad mathematically.""  Level 20 factotum spend points to mimic the class features of other classes for a period of time (like monk flurry of blows, etc.).  But in 5th edition I don't feel like this would be a good practice.    And I understand that how the spells work can be confusing due to wording.  But the way it works is after you long rest you get to prepare spells equal to your spells known, but only one of your max level known.  You can not prepare the same spell more than once.  After you use a spell during the day you are unable to use it a second time. After a long rest your unexpended spells disappear and you repeat the cycle. You can prepare the same spells multiple days in a row."
UnearthedArcana,3dc0st,Ceiling90,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:27:55 2015 UTC,"I mean, the Arcane Dilettante, do you have only 1 spell slot?  - in 5e Spells prepared and Spell slots are not the same. A wizard at 1st level can prepare something like 6 (1st level) spells, but only have two 1st level spell slots.  - the way warlock spell slots work is that you get so little, but they auto-level, as in a 2nd level Warlock has 2 spell slots that cast as 1st level slots, but a 5th level Warlock has 2 spells slots that cast as 3rd level spell slots.   (this is all preface)  So, unless you're not following that, you can cast a total of 7 spells per day? You prepare a spell, and then you can vary the maximum slot level? I'm not sure how that works or why you choose to go that way.  Hmmm. You're right about not going above 4th level. That's fine.   Taking that as an example, it's probably your understanding of how the Brainstorm points work. I'm not a fan of them. I think they overly complicate it. Yeah, it's my confusion about casting them with the points.   Because if everything were working on an easy recharge, versus points that recharge - I think I'd redo Arcane Dilettante completely.  Arcane Dilettante: You get one spell slot that automatically casts at the maximum level as denoted on the chart (probably a lot like the Spell Thief), once you expend this slot you must finish a short rest before you can use it again. You can prepare a number of Wizard Spells equal to Half your rogue level + intelligence level per long rest. Spellbook, yada yada for how many spells you know. Also, since you don't have cantrips, which already differentiates it from many arcane/casting archetypes.   It gives you a singular spell slot that recharges per short rest, and it isn't as complicated - that is if you're not using brainstorm points.  You know what, it's the Brainstorm points and the front loading I don't agree with. Essentially, you go three levels into this and you're pulling in more versatility and possible abuse - because with this you're essentially getting more spell slots for ""free"", or getting what is essentially lay on hands for ""free"" or the ability to essentially bardic inspire themselves. With a 3 level investment all on top of the Rogue standard abilities.  That's why I feel that you should drop the Brainstorm points stagger out the Dabbling, and give everything simple but concrete recharges.   I'm not really arguing or being defensive of my suggestions, but once that realization hit, I finally figured out why I didn't like that front loading at all or the Brainstorm points.   Also, how about for the capstone, make it a complete mimic of an ability that affects or misses the Factotum? So let's say you get hit with a dragon's fire breath, you mimic it back once a day or something."
UnearthedArcana,3d775x,IAmOptimusPrimate,10,Tue Jul 14 01:35:54 2015 UTC,"A lot of my comments may come across as harsh, but I wanted to preface it with this is a really good start! The alchemist has always been a cool class to me.  The biggest hugest issue here is everything is super vague. I'm guessing this may be covered under the homebrew rules you mentioned or you simply know how these abilities work, but as it stands this class is impossible for somebody else to use without a lot more information. It's also hard to comment on balance of the class without this information.  If you're interested I can give you more ideas and suggestions to go forward, just let me know!  Class Features  Potion Brewing   At 1st level it's a DC 3 ... what? Intelligence? Do you get to add proficiency? Straight d20? If you get to add proficiency, why make a check at all? It would be impossible to fail without rolling a natural 1. You can brew 2 potions per round...as what? Standard action I would assume, but it isn't specified. Higher Level potions:     Probably not balanced, not sure 'Increasingly smaller' odds of success means? I'm assuming the DC goes up? By how much? 'Destructive failure' means? And what are the odds of this? Is it a d% roll when you fail to brew? Is it a d% if you're 5 points below the DC? Is it a random failure? Is it always damage?     What differentiates a destructive failure from a failure that gives you a mystery potion? Is the only way to create a mystery potion to get hit during combat?   Liquid Potions   What dictates if this liquid needs to be poured over a person or needs to be drank?  What can you liquefy? Anything magical? Is there a limit? Can a 1st level Alchemist liquefy an artifact that he found?  How long does this process take? Is it the same for all items?   Potion Tosser: this ability feels like it's making something more complicated than it really needs to be   Rules already exist for throwing flasks and the like Increasing the difficulty for every 5 feet beyond the first 20...how does this work? If you're making an attack roll to hit, does this increase the enemy's AC? At what point if ever is the throw made with disadvantage? DC 10 to penetrate skin - what is this? I would assume the enemy has to make this save, but what kind of save is it? Constitution? Potions tossed at allies depend on accuracy? What is accuracy? d%? d20? Attack roll? The section about tossing potions at allies refers to 'the damage done by breaking glass' but there's no reference to this damage anywhere else? Does this target a single unit? A single square? If it hits an area, what's the point of the later Explosive Potion? It specifically calls out that you can apply poison effects, what about other effects?   Potion Launcher   A somewhat minor point, but you forgot to include that the Alchemist is automatically proficient with this weapon. As a martial ranged weapon, if you don't specify this, an Alchemist can't actually use this The launcher being difficult to enchant, I assume, is a reference to house rules? 5E doesn't really have standard enchanting rules like say Pathfinder does   Gaseous Potions   You've referenced them before this point, but...what exactly are ""on hit effects""? I know what they are in the context of League of Legends, but 5th edition DnD doesn't really have that category of effect How long does it take to heat a potion? 30 seconds? 1 round? 5 minutes? How quickly does the gas expand? It starts in a 5' cube and is gone in 30 seconds, but what's in between? Does it end covering a 10' cube? A 50' cube? If the effect becomes weaker, does that have any mechanical impact? Do they have advantage on the save after a certain level of 'weakness'? Or do they always have advantage because it's a gas?   Potion Enhancement   Full actions aren't a thing anymore. Perhaps make this an out of combat only ability? Is there a limit to how often this can be done? Why wouldn't an alchemist simply improve all his potions ahead of time then? If there's no limit, why not make it a passive ability that approves the effectiveness of all potions?   Weapon Enhancement   Anyone can apply a poison to a weapon - without poisoning themselves like Pathfinder - so the selling point of this is that you can get more use out of the poison. Possibly rename this ability to something like Durable Poison? What about non-poison potions, like Alchemist's Fire?   Quick Brewing   Can you still create 2 potions per turn then as a bonus action?   Explosive Potion   What's this do? Is the intent to allow the alchemist to deliver potion effects in AoE? Again, how long does this take?   Class Table   The fact that Potion Slots is the number of items you can carry isn't very clear. I would phrase it as the number of brewed potions you can have currently active - similar to the Pathfinder Alchemist, where he may only have a certain number of extracts prepared and beyond that the previous ones brewed become inactive. Mechanically similar but makes more sense than being physically limited by carrying capacity. The spell slots - what these do isn't specified. Is that the max number of each level you can brew per day? What happens if you try to brew beyond that? Will it fail automatically? Can you simply not attempt it? Does the DC go up exponentially? Can you use a higher level slot to prepare a lower level potion?   Potion Bandolier   Obviously it's used to carry potions, but I think it'd be nice if you added an entry at the end of the class detailing this item, with things from the gear list: cost, weight, description, etc. The class essentially becomes dependent on this item. It should convey a definite benefit, such as having potions readily available, but why can't an alchemist simply carry his potions in his backpack?   Specific Potions   Philter of Eternal Life: I like the flavor of this, but honestly how often does death from old age come up in games? The fact that it's 50k gold and only adds 1 year to your life further decreases the usefulness of it, not counting whatever the DM rules a branch from the tree of life costs Poison of Instant Death: 10d10 at 17th level is honestly pretty mediocre as a single use. On the other hand, with Weapon Enhancement, this is a free 10d10 on every weapon hit forever"

UnearthedArcana,3d9tf5,IWantToFishIt,4,Tue Jul 14 16:53:26 2015 UTC,"These are outrageously overpowered. The primary source is doubling the value of superiority the superiority dice. Just get rid of this. If you want to keep something similar have them roll two and take the higher.   Additionally, no amount a versatility loss makes up for a power spike. While versatility gain makes a character stronger, what you're doing is over specialization. This is a benefit I would imagine from a feat, not -1 maneuver.   Lastly, the most potent of these maneuvers all at least double use the already doubled bonus you gave them. A few examples being trip, lunge, and sweeping. They're simply too powerful for what is being given up. Either lower their potency and increase their cost (of anything other than versatility). Maybe costing two superiority dice to use would help."

UnearthedArcana,3d9tf5,OrkishBlade,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:26:43 2015 UTC,"Conceptually, I like this idea, but the power level is out of hand.   The double power has to go -- either you get to add double the superiority die OR target additional creatures, extend duration, etc. (like /u/Bronze_Johnson says). If not as a feat, I could imagine offering the option to upgrade one maneuver (maybe two) to an advanced version in place of upgrading superiority dice at 10th and/or 18th level -- you'd sacrifice on the superiority bonus on other maneuvers, but you'd still get double on your advanced maneuvers. Whether offered as a feat or as a class feature variant, make the advanced version either recharge after a long rest (or cost double the superiority dice, as suggested) -- imagine being able to knock down a half-dozen enemies six times in one combat encounter! (Crazy talk!)"
UnearthedArcana,3d6d8w,AFuryOfOwls,3,Mon Jul 13 21:44:00 2015 UTC,This feels more at home as a ranger archetype.
UnearthedArcana,3d6d8w,IWantToFishIt,2,Mon Jul 13 22:12:42 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking.  I was reading this and thought the same - or a paladin.  With the removal of alignment restrictions, this could easily be a paladin."
UnearthedArcana,3d6d8w,revkaboose,2,Tue Jul 14 03:29:54 2015 UTC,"My reason for not making it Ranger or Paladin archetype comes down to the spellcasting, and the nature of how Paladins and Rangers work.  Paladins and Rangers both have half-spellcasting progressions, which quite frankly, didn't go with what I had in mind for the archetype. My inspiration came from Blade and Van Hellsing (from the 2004 movie, as bad as that sounds), where the hunter had some basic things that improved what they used to hunt the creatures, and some innate badassness, but that's it, no magic really.  That being said, thematically, both the ""blessings"" and the Prey match up with Paladins & Rangers respectively, pretty well, the biggest thing being the non-archetype stuff.    Rangers get tons of stuff that is regarding nature, foraging, tracking, and stealth in nature, which is neat, but doesn't really go super well with the Purifier, it doesn't clash with it persay, but it seems to preclude the Purifier to having a certain background and such.  Paladins get tons of auras, as well as Lay on Hands, which don't really thematically go with this idea of a monster/abomination slayer specialist.   The distinction I made with regards to this archetype and the Oath of Vengeance was this:    Oath - Destroy evil because it hurts people Purifier - Destroy evil because it exists and shouldn't.    To me, the former implies that destroying the evil is to help people, and thus, if they can, they should help people if they can't directly go destroy the evil right then. The latter is, kill the evil, screw the people, people on their own can be just as evil, but at least they aren't literally monsters, if that makes any sense."
UnearthedArcana,3d6d8w,13sparx13,2,Tue Jul 14 04:49:11 2015 UTC,"Aight, I'ma have to fix a few things here:  Prey: Never explained properly, though easy to figure out.  Saves: A 'Purifier save' isn't a thing. When a creature makes a save, it's tied to one of the six base stats.  Language: A few things that you have to fix if you're gonna be pedantic (though there's no real reason to if you don't want to, of course)   ""It must make a X saving throw"" is the proper language for saves. Looking at Bane, the damage increase should be worded like the scaled cantrips: ""This damage increases by 1d8 at 11th level."" Super pedantic, but you should use 'it/its' instead of 'they/their'. Trail of Blood should say 'take 1 X damage per turn for the next 1d6 turns'. Pierce the Darkness should say that you make another attack roll against an adjacent minion.   Anyway, I don't want to annoy you too much. Just compare stuff to similar effects in the PHB."
UnearthedArcana,3d6d8w,13sparx13,2,Mon Jul 13 23:54:44 2015 UTC,"Most of these are grammar/spelling issues, like you said, so I'll work on fixing them.  With regards to the Trail of Blood, I actually was taking a cue from Barbazus (Bearded Devils) in the Monster Manual. They have a glaive attack that (in Pathfinder at least) was a bleed, but, the wording they used is:   lose 5 (1dl0) hit points at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal wound   As such, since this is pretty unique, as there aren't many bleed effects, I figured I should follow suite. If you have any ideas otherwise, please let me know."

UnearthedArcana,3d2fps,_Clown,2,Sun Jul 12 23:59:53 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea. I've got some comments/questions:   What do you do to mark a quarry (action, bonus action, ritual, etc). What if you never find your quarry? You basically have no archetype abilities for the rest of the campaign. It feels like you will have to strongarm your party into following your quarry if you want to avoid this. Not a good thing. The abilities across each level feel very unbalanced. Executioner (extra no-concentration stronger Hunter's Mark), Indomitable Fortitude (keep from dying 11 times), and Perfect Offense seem way ahead of the others (always crit, but can also crit twice). I have these concerns because either you are fighting your quarry, and have an insane boost (which is good if you can mark them as soon as you see them), but you get literally nothing if you are not fighting your quarry, which is super unfun."
UnearthedArcana,3d2fps,kcon1528,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:58:22 2015 UTC,"I actually have been working on it the past couple days since I first submitted it with some feedback from other people. Take a look at the new version and tell me what you think!  With regards to your points though:   That's actually something I haven't thought about at all. I figured it would be instantaneous but perhaps I should make it a ritual. I tried to work on that in this version though I admit it's certainly not perfect and I'm working to make one last revision before playtesting it. In this version I tried emphasizing terrain bonuses more, as well as giving bonuses that would benefit the player even when not directly involved with the quarry (whilst still keeping that the major idea!) Insofar as Indomitable Fortitude was concerned - that was just a mistake on my part. I have in this version changed to every Long Rest, but I am tempted to change it to every Short Rest, as it seems to UNDERpowered now compared to the other options. I have also changed all of the Legendary Tracker options. My intention for Perfect Offense was to roll double damage dice only on the weapon roll itself. The  issue with Legendary Tracker right now is, compared to PD and PO, Beyond This World (while I Love the idea the most) does not provide enough benefits, I don't think, to warrant most people taking it. I think I have addressed this as best as I can right now. It's hard though to balance this I think. I created this, in all honesty, simply with a character for my campaign in mind. The idea was he would continuously track bad guys going up the ladder (i.e. the first 'boss', then the next 'boss', etc) with the goal of having at least 5-6 quarries in a game. Flavor-wise we already have Hunter, so I wanted to make one that really emphasized the single-target bonus, but perhaps DnD simply isn't meant for that.   Sorry for the wall of text! If you read it all I really appreciate it! I think I will be posting either this version, or perhaps V3 soon =)"

Plus the new ability to have 2handed weapons and cast spells at the same time.   I like the style but there is just too much here not to pick them."
UnearthedArcana,3cza2d,Lord_of_Hydras,0,Sun Jul 12 18:13:59 2015 UTC,"Anyone can make an attack with a light weapon if they are dual wielding, so I don't see an issue there. The extra arms thing doesn't grant more of those.  And I'd need to play it out, but the only real benefit I can see for the being able to do somatic components and hold a weapon would be being able to attack without disadvantage as a spellcaster when enemies get into melee with you. That doesn't seem all that powerful,  honestly.  As for the natural armor, I can honestly take it or leave it. Having naturally tough hide is cool, but I can concede that it's pretty unnecessary."
UnearthedArcana,3cza2d,Lord_of_Hydras,3,Sun Jul 12 19:17:01 2015 UTC,Who said anything about light weapons? not me. but being able to sword & board and cast spells replaces a big reason to take war caster. You cant cast somantic spells if you have something in both hands.   Its a spell/invocation that they dont have to prepare/choose.
UnearthedArcana,3cza2d,Lord_of_Hydras,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:22:46 2015 UTC,"Your comment of   free bonus action attack.   seemed to imply to me that you thought their four arms were intended to give them multiattack or possibly allow two weapon fighting without actually having multiple weapons. My mistake, I apologize.  As for them being able to hold weapons/shield and cast, I honestly don't see an issue with it. Yes, it keeps you from having to take a feat if you want to be a sword & board caster, but you can still only do one thing in a turn.   Can't Two Weapon Fight after casting a spell, because you have to make a Melee Weapon Attack to trigger it. Can't Two Weapon Fight with a Great Sword and a Dagger, because both weapons have to be Light (or non-Light One Handed, if you have the Dual Wielder Feat).  Most Bonus Action spells are meant to be used in tandem with a weapon attack, so no real difference there.   Is it unbalanced? Probably, yes. But A Thri-kreen can't easily communicate with fellow party members. Based on the world you're using them in, their level of social acceptance can vary wildly. And one might even argue that since the Thri-kreen language has no written components, it might be difficult or even impossible for them to meet verbal components for spells."

As with everything we put out on MFoV, this race is extremely experimental and subject to change based on reader feedback. Our system is to put stuff out unfinished-ish, and have people critique it. We then rebalance, playtest, and re-publish it. Just letting y'all know, I have done a major retool of the thri-kreen since this link was posted."
UnearthedArcana,3cza2d,Whyareyoufollowingme,2,Tue Jul 14 06:42:01 2015 UTC,"Since I've commented on your most recent post, I'll take a look at the Thri-kreen now."
UnearthedArcana,3cza2d,Leuku,2,Tue Jul 14 09:39:11 2015 UTC,"Four-arms: I would make the smaller arms not be able to use weapons at all. Instead, give the Thri-Kreen one more free object interaction per round.  Venemous Bite: Paralyzed is a very powerful condition, and with the current wording, you can use Venemous Bite again and again until it finally works. I might suggest tying it to Con mod per long rest, minimum 1, no re-use on a miss.  Gythka: Do gythka's need to be made of dasl? There's nothing in this text that indicates that it does. Either way, it's too powerful of a weapon. It's basically half the benefit of the Dual Wielder Feat and it works with Two Weapon Fighting Style. It's Finesse while also being Heavy, which is oxymoronic. Considering it's special properties, it should have damage dice no more than 1d6/1d6 or 1d8/1d4. The latter steps on the toes of the Polearm Master feat, though.  Chatchka: If anything should have finesse, it's this.  Remember: weapons in 5e are virtually identical to their comparative counterparts. This allows weapons to be chosen for their flavor, rather than their strict mechanical benefit."
UnearthedArcana,3cza2d,Whyareyoufollowingme,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:58:03 2015 UTC,"The minor arms thing is a good point. I'll look into that.  Venomous bite can only be used once. Once you successfully hit with a bite attack, save or fail, it's used up until the next long rest. It works similarly to the Paladin's smite, where you choose to use it after you hit with your bite. The trade-off is that you're only doing 1d4 damage, and the target can keep attempting the saving throw every turn.   Gythkas and chatkchas can be made of dasl, but there are advantages to investing in steel, as presented in the weapon rules.  I misread the rules about thrown weapons. I'll stick finesse in there now."
UnearthedArcana,3cza2d,Leuku,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:49:54 2015 UTC,"I got the confusion regarding Venomous Bite from this wording:   Once you successfully inject a creature with your venom, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.   ""Successfully"" implies to me that a creature must fail its saving throw against venom before the bite is considered ""Successful"".  The design of the Gythka has not been addressed at all.  Also, the Chatchka may need some rebalancing as well. As it stands, it has the damage and range of the Javelin, but the properties of the dagger. I recommend either reducing its range to 20/60 or removing the light property."
UnearthedArcana,3cza2d,SpousalSwine,2,Wed Jul 15 00:12:01 2015 UTC,"Gythka - I guess ""heavy"" was kind of the wrong word for Wizards to describe the stuff with. It has to be finesse because it's a twirly, blade dancer-type weapon, and thri-kreen are dex-based creatures, and a strength-based primary wouldn't make sense. It has to be heavy because it's long and too unwieldy for halflings and the like to use. I will bump its damage down a bit though.  Doing your suggestion to the chatkcha as well."
UnearthedArcana,3cza2d,JamesMusicus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:40:59 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Alright, Finesse and Heavy might work in this context. But heavy necessitates some minimal amount of strength. Have you ever wielded weapons before? A bo-staff? Katana? We look at the weapons in the PHB and go, ""2 lb sword? That's not heavy at all!"" But that's insanely deceptive. Wielding my bamboo shinai, which weights maybe a pound, is such an enormous strain on my arms after only a couple minutes, especially through sparring.  Even knives made for combat are real heavy, but they're still light enough, and small enough, to be used with any reasonable degree of strength.  But a bladed staff as tall as a person weighing a considerable 6 pounds? Minimal threshold of strength is absolutely necessary, as it is for wielding any polearm. I've got a pretty heavy Bo-staff which may weigh around 3-4 lbs and swinging that around with full concentration gets me dead tired in just a few minutes.   I might recommend a minimum Strength score of 13 to wield the Gythka to preserve its Finesse/Heavy status. It indicates that you need a certain muscle density to provide you the freedom to wield a Gythka to its max capability. Anyone who swings a Gythka without meeting Str 13 swings with disadvantage."

It's worth looking closely at the original bardic colleges to see the pattern their benefits follow.  Level 3: Extra proficiencies, and a new way to use Bardic Inspiration to help the party. This differentiates the colleges by showcasing what they're good at, and augmenting what they will be doing a lot at low levels, BI dice to help the party. Alluring performance doesn't quite mesh with this by making it just a solo-bard thing rather than a party feel, and the bonus proficiencies are pretty much just one instance of expertise (any bard going down this path probably already has persuasion AND deception), and they get four other lots of expertise anyway.  Level 6: A new spell to cast, or the ability to attack twice. These are direct combat and gameplay assisting factors that do not rely on BI. Your Powerful Presence relies on bardic inspiration dice again, which is a break from the pattern.  Level 14: There isn't a solid pattern here, but it seems to be generally focusing on what makes the college unique, improved skill use and combat effectiveness, respectively. Inspiring Words doesn't seem like the epitome of what you're going for with this college, to me, so it doesn't hugely fit."

UnearthedArcana,3cvw1j,constnt,2,Sat Jul 11 06:04:36 2015 UTC,"Haven't gotten a chance to do playtesting, unfortunately. It probably is a bit over-powered compared to the other classes, but hopefully not broken. I over-tuned it just a bit on purpose since it's easier to start high and then trim things down until you're in-line, than it is to start weak and try to figure out what to buff.  As for Ribbons, I actually had planned for those at levels 9, 13, and 17 which are currently empty right now (aside from getting a new spell level), but its surprisingly hard to think up good ""ribbons"" for the death knight, since so much of their lore and abilities are focused on combat and basically just being really powerful."
UnearthedArcana,3cvw1j,Leuku,6,Sat Jul 11 06:28:46 2015 UTC,"Levels in which you gain higher level spell slots aren't meant to carry anything, let alone ribbons.

UnearthedArcana,3cvw1j,Leuku,2,Sat Jul 11 07:05:13 2015 UTC,"Hm, true. That still leaves the issue of what abilities to give out, though.

They seem to generally fix all of their problems by just killing things.   If that is true, then the entire design intent philosophy is flawed. Classes and subclasses are much more than ""How Do I Deal Damage?"" Damage dealing is the most quantifiable way that we can judge classes, but any given class has Three pillars of development: Combat, Exploration, Interaction.   If the Lore behind your class does not readily inform you of the kind of features that would fulfill Exploration and Interaction, then the Lore is flawed and needs reconstruction before any further class mechanic development can be made.  Like you said, Death Knights as monsters are normally walking bringers of death. They have no depth, other than the tale that brought them to become Death Knights. That is why traditionally they are monsters, not classes. They're too shallow.  I recommend trying to expand the ""Death Knight"" in to something broader, so that you may have a more rich foundation from which to draw flavor."

I recently made a ""Wraith"" class that's similar in concept to your Death Knight. It's based off of combining the wraiths from LoTR and The Others from ASoIaF/GoT. The class deals cold damage, has resistance to cold, blah blah. But the Wraiths are created, not born, when someone is killed but does not pass onto the afterlife entirely due to dark or powerful magic.  I noticed a similar idea with your class in the document. Death Knights are ""created, not born"". I think that's interesting. Build from that. If they are created, are they given a purpose? Does that purpose become the player's motivation? If they were once alive, do they remember their former life? If so, how should that effect their interactions with NPCs and character development? If not, what motivates them? Are they following the orders of their creator? That's what I would look at to get your unique flavor, in this case.  All in all, I like the idea.

As for Remorseless Winter, Ice Storm is already on the spell list, so no point in re-skinning. Mostly what I was hoping for was some kind of powerful equivalent to Dark Transformation and Dancing Rune Weapon for the ice themed death knight. Doesn't even need to be called Remorseless Winter, for that matter, though it's a very evocative and cool name."

I wrote in a bit on your doc with the idea of Remorseless Winter as a control spell instead. In case it gets deleted:   An icy wind begins to whip around the death knight, conjuring snow and hail to swirl around the area. The area is considered obscured and difficult terrain. Creatures who are within the spell at the beginning of their turn must make a Constitution saving throw or be chilled, taking 1D4 cold damage. Chilled creatures have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws. When a chilled creature leaves the affected area, they stop being chilled after 1D4 rounds. The Death Knight is immune to all of these effects.   It's got decent flavor and would be great against a number of smaller creatures, but isn't an auto win button when fighting bosses. It doesn't quite fill your niche of being a frost equivalent of Dark Transformation or Dancing rune Weapon, but I still like it."

UnearthedArcana,3cot9h,Strangecraft,6,Thu Jul 9 15:58:38 2015 UTC,"I will quote what I wrote regarding the Bladedancer when the Bladedancer was posted yesterday on /r/UnearthedArcana:    When you take an Attack action while you are Dervish Dancing, you may make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target. At 6th level, you make two attacks, instead of one, against each creature.   I would take out the two attacks at 6th level thing. This feature is already a better version of the Hunter Ranger's 11th level Whirlwind Attack feature without the two attacks at 6th level thing, albeit with greater restrictions. The restrictions (tied to bardic die, requires bonus action, lasts a variable number of rounds) justify it coming online at 3rd level rather than 11th, but not granting twice as many attacks as Whirlwind attack.  Thousand Cuts: The cumulative -1s go against the general design philosophy of 5e, namely ""Avoid small incremental static modifiers"". If I were to come up with a variation, it would be:  While Dervish Dancing, whenever an enemy starts its turn adjacent to you or willingly moves adjacent to you, the enemy takes damage equal to your Charisma modifier. The damage type is dependent on whatever weapon you happen to be wielding at that moment."
UnearthedArcana,3cot9h,Leuku,3,Thu Jul 9 16:35:39 2015 UTC,"I had no idea that was posted on UnearthedArcana (I certainly didn't do it.)  Should I upgrade the level of the second attacks on the Dervish Dance or drop it altogether? Also, I agree with out on the incremental modifiers thing, and I was hesitant to implement it because of that, but I'm looking for something that makes it harder to lay each successive hit on the enemy and couldn't think of anything clever.  To clarify, is your suggestion a constant effect while you're dervish dancing?"
UnearthedArcana,3cot9h,Leuku,3,Thu Jul 9 16:48:22 2015 UTC,"Drop the additional attack for Dervish Dance at 6th level. Bards in 5e aren't normally damage dealers to begin with. The sweeping attack you give the BattleDancer changes that dramatically. Sure, it's not focus fire, but Bards aren't good at focus-fire damage anyways.   You have concerns about the Battledancer being predisposed to being hit more often to take full advantage of its features, but there is an easy fix around that: 2 levels of Rogue.  Cunning Action will invariably grant a Battledancer a bonus action disengage all day, and since the sweeping attack doesn't require a bonus action, this bard will be a whirlwind of death every round it is dancing.   Regarding Thousand Cuts: Yes. Action-free damage whenever the conditions are met for as long as the Battledancer dervishes.  And it fits thematically with its namesake; get anywhere near a Dervish Dancer while she's dancing and you'll get cut, no if ands or buts."
UnearthedArcana,3cot9h,Leuku,3,Thu Jul 9 16:59:39 2015 UTC,"I felt like I had to give the dervish some form of extra attack to bring him in line with other melee characters. I'd love if you could weigh in on that sentiment. I might make it so that you can hit one creature twice when you dervish dance, and all other creatures once. I like your version of Thousand Cuts, by the way."
UnearthedArcana,3cot9h,Leuku,3,Thu Jul 9 17:16:02 2015 UTC,"The Dervish already exceeds other melee characters through the on-demand sweeping attack it receives at level 3, which must I remind you is something only a level 11 Hunter Ranger can do.  Do not try to equate the Bard's melee prowess to the prowess of intended melee classes like the Paladin and Fighter.  The Bard has Full Casting to compensate for lack of comparative melee power. You already dramatically increase the bard's normal melee power through that sweeping attack.  Think less of making any subclass on par with any other class that dedicates itself to that particular stage. Think more on simply enhancing the base class through subclasses beyond what the base class could normally do.  I think the above applies to much of Vecna's work; perhaps it is the case that the common cause of people calling Vecna's work overpowered is that the Vecna creators try too hard to match the power of established material instead of focusing on simply enhancing the base class through filling a unique niche. By trying so hard to match the damage base of normally non-damaging classes with damaging classes, Vecna exceeds their power, because seemingly Vecna forgets that the base class itself has more than enough power to compensate for unequal damage comparisons.  It is simply enough to boost damage on subclasses that are meant to deal more damage than their base class normally provides. Never forget what the base class can do.  Sweeping Attack (which is what I'm calling it at this point) is more than enough of a damage boost for the Full Casting Bard class. It Doesn't. Need. More.  Each time you come up with a new feature, try asking:   ""Who Else Can Do This, and at What Level?""  In the Sweeping Attack Dervish's case: An 11th level Hunter Ranger could do that.   A 3rd level Bard doing what an 11th level Hunter Ranger can do?   Then we go with restrictions to justify that.  Lastly, Simplicity is King.  The more streamlined you can make a feature, the better. The fewer interactions of numbers, the better. The less you have to count on your hands, the better. The less a DM has to keep in mind, the better.   So I would recommend not letting a Battledancer hit one creature twice and all other creatures once.  Name one class that can do that at any level. Name one. There is no one. Granting the bard such an ability would make the Bard the only class that could do such a thing on top of being a Fullcaster. It says to the Ranger: ""I'm a better caster and a better multi-attacker than you!"""
UnearthedArcana,3cot9h,Leuku,4,Thu Jul 9 17:47:57 2015 UTC,"Good advice. So, dropping the extra attack right now. I'll edit in your version of the capstone later after I do some math and make sure it doesn't have any kinks."

UnearthedArcana,3cot9h,Omega_Advocate,6,Sat Jul 11 04:05:59 2015 UTC,"Entropy Domain:  I do not understand the choices for the domain spells. Based on the flavor text, such a domain adherent favors entropy over anything else, and yet there are spells that virtually reduce entropy.  Gentle Repose, Fabricate, Otiluke's Resilient Sphere, and Wall of Force are all things that restrict, confine, and order, consequently reducing entropy.  Bane, I kind of get, but Witchbolt? Why witchbolt? What the hell does Witchbolt have to do with entropy?  Spells that might be better fits for the theme of entropy might be: Create or Destroy Water, Confusion, even Conjure Barrage, Color Spray, maybe homebrew a spell that is the reverse of Calm Emotions, Blink, Inflict Wounds, and bah! I'm going to move on.  Entropic Touch: So you give the Cleric a cantrip that does on par damage with any other cantrip, except with a damage cap far exceeding every single other cantrip (except EB, which is its own thing anyways)?  What is the justification for this?  ""When I deal more damage than usual, I should deal even more damage! And when I deal more damage than usual on that even more damage, I should deal even more damage!""  ...  I can't really think of anything to fix this at this moment. Rather than giving a rider effect, it just increases damage. How unimaginative.   Perhaps... I dunno. Go back to the drawing board. Try and come up with a rider effect appropriate for entropy.  Distortion Field: Perhaps reword it, because as written, it's either/or on the damaging/healing thing. Meaning you either only damage creatures in the space, or only heal. If that is your intention, then don't pay this any mind.  Return to Entropy: More and more this subclass appears geared towards mastery of energy movement itself, not entropy. Entropy wouldn't help you repair anything. This cleric is more like an Alchemist, concerned with the the comprehension, deconstruction, and reconstruction of energy in matter.  Sphere of Annihilation: It does not specify that you are unaffected by your own sphere of annihilation. Wizards can hit themselves with their own fireballs. Can you hit yourself with your own Sphere of Annihilation? Does it require concentration? Might want to put in half damage on a successful save. It only has a 15 foot movement speed per turn; easily escapable by most any creature. Don't even have to dash to be 2 rounds away from being anywhere near it. Dash and it's 4 rounds away from it.  It should not materialize in the Cleric's space, then. It should materialize at any point the Cleric can see within 30 feet of the Cleric. That way the Cleric can necessarily try to damage someone on Round 1."
UnearthedArcana,3cot9h,Lord_of_Hydras,8,Thu Jul 9 18:59:58 2015 UTC,"Path of the Colossus:  Being as blunt as I can be, this is bad design philosophy. Every single feature here is a combat feature. The Unearthed Arcana article ""Modifying Classes"" specifically states that the 6th level feature of the Barbarian is geared towards Exploration, and the 10th level is geared towards Interaction.  And the features themselves are poorly designed. Whose brain-child was it to exceed the 20 score cap at any level other than 20th level? I'd like to meet the person and bonk the person on the head.  Great Swing: Holy Excessive Restrictions Batman! If you have to make such claustrophobic restrictions to justify the benefit of this feature, then the benefit of the feature itself is bad. Why not just do sweeping attack except with -5 to the roll? This isn't so bad cuz it mixes well with Reckless Attack, which gives you advantage on your attack rolls, and the two work together thematically.  Rock Throwing: How on earth is this a feature worth an entire level? You'd do more damage using your attack action to throw two hand axes. Damage: 2 x (1d6 + str). Let's assume strength mod is +4. That is 2 x (3.5 + 4) = 15 damage.  Compared to 2d8 + str = 2 x 4.5 + 4 = 13.   Oh, let's not forget the entirely broken strength score increase that will increase the strength modifier. This dramatically increases the damage of multiattacks over singular attacks. Assuming 30 Strength score, the damage of two handaxes becomes: 2 x (3.5 + 10) = 27 vs. rock throwing 2 x 4.5 + 10 = 19.5  You get slightly better range, with 30 feet instead of 20, but why use a weapon range not represented in the official material at all?   And then there's the fact that the rock must be around 30 pounds. How many around 30 lb rocks is a barbarian expected to have access to?   Massive Swing: Same criticism as granting the Battledancer 2 swings against 1 target and 1 swing against all other adjacent targets. Also, terribly unimaginative.   My recommendations: Scrap the entire subclass. More important than the balance of the features is the philosophy of the subclass, the design intent goal. Such a goal should inform the creator on how to fulfill the Combat/Exploration/Interaction pillars of the subclass. While combat is the easiest pillar to confront and compare, it is only a third of the equation.  Question for Vecna Creators to ask themselves: When making Feature ""X"", can I do ""X"" better through official means?"

UnearthedArcana,3cot9h,Unsight,0,Sat Jul 11 23:25:25 2015 UTC,"The UA advice says itself that only the totem barbarians level 6 feat is geared towards exploration. No idea where you have your ""exploration means overcoming boundaries"" idea from. Obviously, not even the D&D creators thought of resisting charms and fears as an exploration ability, else they would have said that both paths level 6 ability are geared towards exploration.   Meanwhile, using Intimidate is interacting with someone, as well.   If I hit somebody, I´m interacting with them. Does that mean it´s not combat anymore? The Interaction pillar is about those phases of the game where you aren´t fighting, or exploring, but interacting with people or things outside of combat. The berserkers path ability is usable in combat and outside of, so it isn´t only for interaction, like the totem paths level 10 ability is.  Also, the UA arcticle gives you guidelines not strict rules. They literally say this in every single advice (""so think twice before changing it"", ""be wary of replacing it"") Design-wise, this makes sense for the Collossus, because the class is about fighting and nothing else. That doesn´t change the fact that this is a terrible design idea for 5e, which I´ve mentioned multiple times myself, but not every homebrew that thought twice and still went through with their change is automatically bad, just that this particularly one is.   If these MFoV brews weren't complete shit, at 6th they'd give the Colossus some kind of unstoppable movement bonus and 10th some kind of interactive ability.   Well, it´s a shame that you decided to fly into an embarrassing ""omg everything is op"" rant in one of the threads on the bigger subs instead of giving solid feedback like you just did. They do change and rebalance their classes when they get enough feedback.  A, frankly, dumb generalisation like ""all the brews are shit"" doesn´t help anyone, not to mention that it´s flat out not true. Vecna released some homebrews that are flavorful, balanced, and not already achievable with the things 5e offer you.

In terms of thematic sense, strength comes into play because of the unshakable and unfailing nature of the cosmic cycles.  Two of the three cosmic phases are focused on being on or near the front-lines, so incentivizing strength as a secondary or tertiary attribute (or possibly even primary, for a melee-focused build) makes the class option more workable."

I'm not positive about the capstone ability, as it seems to take away a lot of the stance-dancing fun that this subclass seems based around. Perhaps make it so that you can move forward OR backwards, instead of just anywhere you want? That way, choosing to be in Phase of the Sun is a deliberate choice to disallow Phase of the Stars for at least two turns.    Plus, it makes Phase of the Moon into a really good ""base-stance."" You have higher armor, can confuse people with spells, and get to give yourself ability boosts at any time. Then, if you need to, you can quickly switch into either other phase.

Perhaps make it so that you can move forward OR backwards, instead of just anywhere you want?   The ability to move backward and forward would be equivalent to choosing an arbitrary phase, since moving backward from Sun would move to Stars and moving forward from Stars would move to Sun...unless you were implying that moving backwards only works for Moon and Stars?

I based it off opportunist and it would be great if a caster got caught in melee. That said the 11th level ability would allow the caster to disengage as a bonus action so it is a bit redundant.

UnearthedArcana,3citwx,Ceiling90,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:28:21 2015 UTC,"I'm really loving all the lore here!  Again, I think your tripping up over your own damage rules with these spellcaster classes. Spells like 'Phantasmal Killer' are basically just glorified fear spells since the damage they deal is so neglabable when other players have access to laser guns. It does at least do DoT damage, so it could be a lot worse, but you'd probably be better off giving them something like Greater Invisibility, Confusion or Compulsion that doesn't scale off damage.  Similarly, Divine Strike, although on par with the other domains should really inflict 2d8 and then 4d8 at later levels since they're meant to emulate a second attack (I'd still not give them the full 6d8 though since you haven't scaled up the dexterity mod of a basic attack).  Otherwise, I feel like their level 18 feature is incredibly lacklustre and quite unlikely to proc in a magic lite setting such as your own. Yes, alien dragon beasts and such will give you gains here, but otherwise you'll barely notice it - not very satisfying for a capstone feature. Although most of your players probably won't get to this level anyway, so I don't know how relevant it'll be either way XD  As a replac,emt you could maybe give them a once per short rest paralysis and frighten power with disadvantage on saving throws or something (I don't know if that'd be OP or not though - you'll have to check through the prexisting domains for exact numbers).  The Ghostwalk spell doesn't sound very useful either - especially for a precious 5th level spell that you can hardly use. I think it should end if you attack someone, make you invisible and last for an hour to fulfill the infiltration theme you have going. Right now it just sounds like you'd use it as a defence buff during a fight. If you were gonna do that, it might as well give you extra attacks as well.  Otherwise, I quite like the fear/immobilistion theme you have going on."
UnearthedArcana,3citwx,Pixie1001,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:00:39 2015 UTC,"As non-setting specific, how does it fair?  But as for setting specific, you're mostly right.   I may make that 18th level cap - ""whenever you drop a hostile creature 0 hp, hostile creatures that can you see must succeed a Wisdom Saving Throw or be Paralyzed for 1 round.""   I am torn between confusion and phantasmal killer; but I feel that Phantasmal killer works better, but may make Setting Specific notes that you could substitute Confusion instead.  I'm not sure what to do with Divine Strike. I don't want to break the mold of 1d8 to 2d8, but with the upgraded damage of modern weaponry, it would have to be upgraded too. How about Blindness/Deafness on hit for 1 round? Alternatively, scrap Divine Strike and just give them a Second Attack or a bonus action attack, and additional damage at 14th level.  I'm loathed to give Invisibility to this domain, as it feels very much the Trickster Domain. Ghost Walk is based on Greater Invisibility and Etherealness; I'd rather have them be able to pass through walls like a ghost than be invisible. I really liked the idea of turning into a ghost."
UnearthedArcana,3citwx,Pixie1001,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:35:27 2015 UTC,"I still think that ghost walk and the 18th level ability are a little below par, even in the generic setting.  I quite like your new idea for the 18th level ability - I think it could definitely work. Alternatively, you could give them something similar to the Rogue's assassinate ability if your solution feels to brawly for this class.  Speaking of the rogue, you should also probably give your archetype for them something that doubles or triples their sneak attack die (I haven't quite done the maths on it yet, but whatever keeps them within the same percentage of DPR to the fighter that the vannilla classes followed) when using futuristic weapons - since vanilla classes can't get their hands on those anyway, it wouldn't upset the balance in an out of setting game either. Otherwise, you could also maybe just make special rogue weapons that give the trait instead - although limiting that class to select weapons might upset players unless you made a whole bunch of them.   I understand that confusion is a little chaotic, but phantismal killer really just doesn't add much utility - phatasmal force from the level before would work much better since it allows you to restrict their movement (As I recall).  Hallucinatory Terrain might be a better choice since it seems to add all the best parts of these abilities together?  Alternatively you could just give all of these setting specific spellcaster archetype's a feature at first level which double their spell damage - or add some kind of nano-foci or implant (kinda like a biotic amp from mass effect) which would bring their damaging spells up to par - even as is, you're definetly gonna be struggling to keep spell variety going otherwise. Obviously this could interfere with your magic-lite theme as well though, so I guess its tricky.  The blindness/deafness idea could totally work for Divine Strike. The only issue with giving them a second attack is that the feature by default only gives half of a second attack when you first get it, before evening out at 14th level to your full extra attack. You can't really simulate the same thing with just a flat second attack.  Personally, I'd just add a little 'Variable rule' thing below saying that for out of setting play the power should be reduced to the default damage scaling of other archetypes.  As for ghost walk, I think the idea fine - but it doesn't feel like a 5th level spell to me. You could probably squeeze it into 3rd level really. Maybe it should give invisibility instead of damage resistance, or inflict the frightened condition on a hit with your basic attacks as well, once per round (just in case a bard or something picks it up and finds a way to abuse it).  I just feel like it needs a little more, esspecially since abilities like misty step already allow you to flit past walls with enough planning.  Anyway, those are just my thoughts."
UnearthedArcana,3citwx,Pixie1001,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:57:32 2015 UTC,"I'm happy for your thoughts, helps me iron out what I'm failing to see.  I think I'll use the paralyze thing for the 18th level cap, along with the Immune to fear.  Yeah, I'll switch to confusion, it works a little better.  I think I'll make the 8th level... a second attack. So kinda like Valor Bard, and at 14th level, they add 1d8 psychic to any weapon attack. I think it'll make up the difference; they aren't relagated to melee weapon only anyway.  I like that idea that Ghost Walk firightens... how about adding ""Any hostile creatures that can see you must make a Wisdom save, or be frightened for the duration. Frightened creatures do not have to make saves for the duration of this effect.""  or is that too strong? Maybe this instead?  ""Once per turn, whenever you hit a creature with an attack, they are frightened for 1 round.""  Forgot: As for rogues, I'm working on more weapons that a rogue can sneak attack with, but more weapons that might just have more sneak attack damage or something. Rogues with Sneak Attack the biggest Nova culprits in my game so far.  As for Spell Casters, this bit of work should probably fall in my third pillar, and I'll go about it then. This is great that it's a dry run per se of what needs to be done for spell casters to catch up.  Thanks, for realz."
UnearthedArcana,3citwx,Pixie1001,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:28:36 2015 UTC,"I'll look through the 5th level spells and get back to you on ghost walk I guess - having it do an AoE fear might be stepping on the toes of the Draconic Sorcerer though, and be a but to similar to dragons in general, which isn't really what the class is about.  Confusion is probably the way to go though - the class is about pointing out the corruption and greed in man's hearts, so I think the Night Maiden would be way into taking advantage of those things in your enemies during battle.  As for the Divine Strike, your solution would probably make it too powerful. The average vanilla attack in classic dnd does about 2D8 damage if you include the ability mod - this is what they get a 14th level. Giving your Domain the equivalant of this 2D8 in the form of a second attack messes things up somewhat - adding the extra 1D8 makes them stronger than the default domains (assuming they were scaling to the new high damage rules you use). So it needs to be something only gives you half an extra attack for a totally average of 4D8 at 14th level. Your solution would give 5 AND let them use this ability on ranged attacks.  Maybe you could give them the extra attack with the 1D8 psychic damage ONLY when they're doible teaming or have advantage - like the rogue's sneak attack. That'd probably balance it out, and add the assassinate theme that's quite important to the Night Maiden's portfolio into the class. You'd still be a little bit more powerful thanthe vanilla clerics for those 4 levels between 8 and 14, but nothing crazy.  Its fair enough thst you'd add all the spellcasting rules later though - just some food for thought. I think the rogue weapons will be really important though.  And dw, I find your stuff really fun to provide feedback on and read through - especially since the setting adds so many new angles to everything and opens you up to trying new stuff that otherwise wouldn't normally fly in the vannilla game."
UnearthedArcana,3cfcro,FGJustice,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:00:19 2015 UTC,"This is a setting-specific archetype for a paladin order that follows a god of fire, rage, and law (yes, all of those things at the same time). This order specifically focuses on the law aspect, with purifying fire as a strong secondary. The greatsword is its favored weapon, so it's meant to be a melee DPS rather than a tank.  I think my main concern here is the spell selection. I was trying to avoid having too many powerful offensive fire spells, but I just didn't like my choices for other non-paladin spells. Any recommendation for the spell list would be appreciated."
UnearthedArcana,3cfcro,Da_Chief99,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:04:04 2015 UTC,"One thing that you should change is the specific references to the Nier.  That would allow this to be applicable to all campaigns.  Without that, it is a very good homebrew.  Try and write it as if the specific god's believes were parts of the tenets.    About the spells:  Level 1 spells to consider instead of hellish rebuke: Hunters mark (would make sense with the hunting down and punishing evil aspect), Possibly re-flavor ensnaring strike to read as flame tendrils instead of sharp vines and then that would be a good spell for this.   Level 2 spells are good.  Level 3 spells.  You should drop the fire only requirement.  While it makes sense thematically, there is no reason mechanically to limit it.  You could view it as practicing with fire also gave the similar ability to do it with lightning and ice.  Drop Fear, as it is too similar to your channel divinity.  Instead, perhaps Speak with Dead (would be very helpful for bringing justice to murderers) or Phantom steed (for chasing down the runners).  Level 4 spells are good.  Level 5 are good as is.  Keep the fire only requirement on this one.  Channel Divinity: Hear my voice seems a bit too similar to the spell fear.  I would change the spell choice as I mentioned above.    Love My word is law.  Everything else mechanical looks good."
UnearthedArcana,3cdr6c,DeCoder68W,6,Tue Jul 7 03:01:37 2015 UTC,"So far the big ones seems to be the fact that Mind Thrust auto-hits animals (with an Int mod of at least 3 it is legitimatly impossible to do so, regardless of the creature's level.) and the regeneration of the Immortal, which in edition to quite probably making them making them way to tanky, is makes them literally impossible to kill since wizards forgot to specify that it stops functioning when you hit 0 HP XD  I'm sure there's others as well."
UnearthedArcana,3cdr6c,Pixie1001,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:41:33 2015 UTC,"You can still nat 1 your attack roll, so there's that. And it might just be me, but psychic backlash sounds a lot worse than smacking yourself with or throwing your sword. And attacking INT instead of AC both makes sense thematically and makes spellcasters a worthy adversary.  Wizards actually didn't forget anything. You have to maintain concentration to keep your Discipline abilities active. And you can't keep concentration if you're unconscious.  I'm pretty happy with the Mystic so far though. It looks like it'll be a fun class that isn't just spellcaster+."
UnearthedArcana,3cdr6c,Kadakism,3,Thu Jul 9 03:17:33 2015 UTC,"You're right that Mind Thrust isn't terribly broken, but it seemed to be something of concern. Not something I'd feel compelled to fix if zi were to playtest the class though.  The Immortal on the other hand is a completely different matter - yes, disiplines stop upon losing conciousness, but the health regen ability isn't a disipline - just a passive class feature like the rogue's sneakmattack or the Sorcerer's scales. It can't be turned off.  I assume they either moved it from a disipline to a feature and forgot to fix the description, or just didn't, consider what would happen upon death - its only a first draft after all.  Another thing people seem to be upset about is object reading which was a little too powerful - especially in a mystery campaign. It felt a little like whoever wrote it was over compensating for the fact that it couldn't be used in combat, but then ended up allowing the player to spy on everyone in the entire village. Seems like something that would be better done through a few less potent ribbon abilities scattered around the archetype.  Other than those mild slip ups though I really enjoy the general design behind the class and the new spin on spellcasting. The core design is solid, it's just a few select features that could do with some polishing."
UnearthedArcana,3cdr6c,Pixie1001,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:41:52 2015 UTC,"Well damn, now I feel sheepish. I totally mixed up what order things were in. So yes, that wording is off.  As for object reading, I think it's really only as powerful as the DM lets it be. Sure, you can pick up the dagger and see into its past when it was used as the murder weapon. But the night was dark and the murderer cloaked.  The psychic senser could be an issue, but again it can easily be thwarted. Yes, you can see from the pov of the ring you gave the now kidnapped prince. But he and the ring are locked in a chest, and so all you see is darkness. It's the same with Speak with Dead. Just because you can talk to the murder victim doesn't automatically mean they have useful information."
UnearthedArcana,3cdr6c,Kadakism,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:05:19 2015 UTC,"In the latest podcast, they talked about how Order of the Immortal was supposed to be almost like Wolverine in terms of healing ability."
UnearthedArcana,3cdr6c,OwenLeaf,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:17:13 2015 UTC,"I still don't think that means they intended to make the class virtually impossible to kill at 3rd level in order to realise that similarlity though  XD  Plus, I feel like they would've added something explaining what to do in the event that regeneration brought you above 0 hitpoints if that was the intent."
UnearthedArcana,3cdr6c,Pixie1001,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:11:48 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that there was a definite mechanical oversight there, but they spoke of the Immortal as being able to shrug off blows that would even kill Barbarians.  I'm not trying to argue, I'm just saying that they intended it to be extremely resilient but they just mechanically made it too powerful.   With some rewriting I think it has some awesome potential to create all kinds of characters."
UnearthedArcana,3cdr6c,OwenLeaf,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:56:43 2015 UTC,"You're bot erong that the intent of the feature is pretty awesome. I'm not sure if the current implementation is perfect, but it's an awesome idea all the same. I look forward to what it'll look like after some more polish :)"
UnearthedArcana,3cdr6c,Pixie1001,5,Mon Jul 13 14:50:29 2015 UTC,"Been working on a psionics homebrew for a week and then they publish this. Oh well. Guess I now have an official framework to start working with. Very excited to see the full 20 levels when they publish it.   Some of my thoughts on the class features:    I really dig Strength of Mind, although I feel that every short rest is far too often.  Mind Thrust feels very strong due to a combination of it being an attack roll vs an Intelligence score (which for most monsters is pretty low), really long range, obscure damage type (only a few creatures are resistant to psychic damage), the ability to buff it up, and not requiring line of sight.  Psychic Mind really should follow the MM rule about only being able to maintain telepathy with one creature at a time.  Object Reading is absolutely absurd amounts of information for an unlimited use 3rd level ability. This could unravel mystery campaigns. Given that its looks to be a ""ribbon"", it feels really powerful for something that is supposed to just give some flavor.  Durable Mind is just a really sweet feature, although it feels incredibly strong.  Martial Order is your run-of-the-mill ""expanded armor and weapons"" feature.  Psionic Regeneration... wow. RAW it grants immortality (it doesn't specify that it ends when you are at 0 hit points); RAI* (presumably) it just is super super tanky.    On the subject of disciplines, I really like the way that they've made psionics a juggling act of a bunch of smaller kits. They really embraced the concentration mechanic that was so prevalent in 3.5e as well, and it fits the theme well. The balance of some augmentations to costs feels a little wonky, but I'm sure they'll figure it out through the play test. (Iron Hide also seems to need a duration qualifier; RAI would almost certainly be 'for that attack' or 'until the start of your next turn'.)"
UnearthedArcana,3cdr6c,aquadrizzt,2,Tue Jul 7 06:40:20 2015 UTC,I don't see any conversation Goin on about this yet? Am I missing something? Psionics are all some people talk about!
UnearthedArcana,3cdr6c,Bluegobln,3,Tue Jul 7 03:02:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly the threads in both /r/dnd and /r/dndnext are full of comments from people going ""WTF?"" because of the mixup on Wizards' end. Its very confusing. So thank you. :D  My thoughts: As a class I think its pretty interesting and I like it. I'll consider it seriously for inclusion in any future campaigns I DM. I haven't read it top to bottom with an eye for exploitation yet so I can't comment on its ability to be abused and broken. Some of the concerns people have about it being broken are probably legitimate though. However, like homebrew content, its pretty easy to correct for anything like that through on the fly adjustments by the DM."
UnearthedArcana,3cdr6c,Robodingo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:31:42 2015 UTC,I can't see the progression beyond level 5. How do you figure out your points and max psi?
UnearthedArcana,3cdr6c,13sparx13,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:58:27 2015 UTC,"Necroposting here, but if you check the DMG's alternate spellcasting rules, it definitely follows the same progression as that:  4/6/14/17/27/32/38/44/57/64/73/73/83/83/94/94/107/114/123/133  As for the disciplines known/pp spending cap, we have a very limited view of the class on those fronts, so guesses are the best we got."

UnearthedArcana,3c9m02,thomar,2,Mon Jul 6 04:54:25 2015 UTC,"Why not put the knife at 1st level in place of unarmed strike?   Because that's not when Monks get subclass features.   Parry seems a bit weak.   Could be.  The other subclasses' level 11 abilities are: Semi-permanent Sanctuary (a level 1 spell, although with greater duration/fewer restrictions), restricted-use teleport, or a variety of elemental attacks.  Compared to that, Shield is probably a little on the weak side.  What if it only cost 1 Ki?"
UnearthedArcana,3c9m02,thomar,2,Mon Jul 6 05:28:56 2015 UTC,"Makes it a very good defensive ability, then. Shield is considered one of the best first-level spells, although a good offensive ability would be preferable. Sounds alright."
UnearthedArcana,3c9m02,thomar,2,Mon Jul 6 17:05:48 2015 UTC,"What if I kept it at 2 Ki, but made a small list of spells to choose from, similar to Way of Shadows level 6?"

EDIT:  Or perhaps level 11 is a good spot to add some effect that lets them bond a regular magic weapon with their Soulknife, similar to Bladelocks.  If they got that AND a 2-Ki Shield ability, that would probably be balanced, yeah?"
UnearthedArcana,3c9m02,KefkeWren,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:10:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe. The precedent for this is the monk's ability to use unarmed strike damage for any weapon, while keeping it balanced by limiting some abilities to unarmed only."

UnearthedArcana,3c9m02,Pixie1001,2,Mon Jul 6 20:23:47 2015 UTC,So... automatic +5 AC forever?
UnearthedArcana,3c9m02,jmartkdr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:19:29 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. There are lots of things that could break concentration. Also, I was more thinking of it being toward the first attack of a round, or an attack of the PC's choosing. However, when you put it like that, it's a fair point. Maybe a constant smaller AC, and the option to spend Ki to attack someone you defended against as a reaction."
UnearthedArcana,3c9m02,Pixie1001,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:27:34 2015 UTC,"I think the initial problem - not getting the class's defining ability until level three - is why soul knife should be a home brew class instead of an archetype.

UnearthedArcana,3c914d,Pixie1001,2,Mon Jul 6 04:16:27 2015 UTC,I hadnt even thought about using it like that. This is more from a DM point of view but putting them into the TL;DR regiments at the bottom might work for a player better than the complex version.

All in all, I'd let a player of mine use any of these, but like you warn at the header, under the strict rule that if I see it shifting the game too strongly in their favor somehow I'm going to re-write them a tad.  A couple are a bit under powered but chock full of flavor so honestly... its all really good.  A for effort, A for result, and an A for going into my collection of great homebrew stuffs. Kinda wish it was a PDF and searchable, eh * shrug *!  I'm going to go over it and try to point out obvious fixable errors. If you wouldn't mind, can we get a text version somehow?"

UnearthedArcana,3c4td5,Bluegobln,4,Sun Jul 5 08:21:26 2015 UTC,"Here are my thoughts on each specific example, and any corrections I could see that made sense to me. Keep in mind this is just opinion stuff so you don't need to address each case, just any you feel like need discussion, or none at all. Thanks! Still think they're pretty awesome regardless! :D  Axeman  ""You gain proficiency with simple and martial axes.""  ""When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points or score a critical hit with an axe, you can use your bonus action to make a single attack with an axe.""  ""When the damage die of an attack made with an axe does not show a maximum result, you deal an additional 1 point of damage with the attack.""  Blunt Weapon Mastery  ""...and know exactly where to replace your heavy blows."" Replace is probably supposed to be place. I would also like to suggest ""...and know exactly where to land your heavy blows.""  Brutal Killer  I would re-word the 3rd ability like this, and nerf it a bit, if you agree, since otherwise it requires the DM to keep track of one more ability (not fun sometimes). ""When you hit a creature that is below its hit points maximum, you may add twice your proficiency bonus to your damage. You may use this feature once and must complete a long rest to use it again.""  Dexterous Grappler  ""You may use your bonus action to attempt a grapple whenever you take the attack action and attempt to grapple a creature."" I think this sentence is messed up somehow, or I'm reading it wrong. I think it has a redund phrase?  Escape Artist  ""...Dexterity (acrobatics)."" Needs an uppercase! :D  Field Medic  ""You must use your action to stabilize the creature if you move within range."" You should make this ""...your next available action..."" to prevent one from cheesing ones way around it.  Gadgeteer  What is this from? Exoskeleton subclass? Is engineering a skill or an artisan's tool of some kind? In my opinion this one should be more descriptive of what it enables one to use proficiently, and what it is actually granting. Try to word it so that it doesn't require whatever material its based on to be useful. For example: my stock D&D 5e campaign has some gadgets in it, players might need to roll to use them, but this currently does nothing for that - it only applies to one specific case. I just think you should diversify it or remove it.  Light Weapon Master  Why is this only melee weapons? No hand crossbow love? You already include daggers which can be thrown, the only thing hand crossbows have over them is a slightly longer range. Also, while I am not a fan of increasing damage die size, I think its not the worst idea ever, personally I would prefer the existing reroll a 1 or some of the other options you've so creatively come up with, which brings up the question of why you have two damage increases on the same feat... wait... add a d4 on a minimum damage roll? That's all that is needed, the damage die size increase is unnecessary I think.  Master Swordsman  ""While wielding a longsword, shortsword, or greatsword, when..."" Why not just ""sword""?  One Step Ahead  ""You are fast and smart;"" Heh. I think something more like ""You always seem to have the initiative..."" It might also be better to re-word this part: ""You may shift your initiative up enough to act before the creature that acts before you..."" to ""You have initiative equal to the next highest roll and take your turn before that creature, unless it is a friendly creature."" and I would add: ""If you already have the highest initiative you can move an additional 5 feet on your next turn.""  Savant  I would reword all of this to start like the Resilient feat (PHB 168) and follow up with choosing a skill to gain proficiency with which uses that ability. However, adding +1 to all of that abilities skills is veeeery powerful for Cha, Wis, and Int. I think you don't need to do anything with the bonus, just remove it. Resilient is a decent feat for odd class / race setups, but this would already be superior without the +1 to all those skills (you get to pick from multiple skill options, where resilient is always proficiency with the chosen stat only).  School Specialist  Unless there is a specific reason you wanted it this way, you should specify ""You learn 2 new spells you could cast of the chosen school of magic, from your class."" This prevents picking up cross-class spells, which I think is intended to be a significant barrier only achievable by multi-classing (which has downsides). Or, well, don't change it. I'm on the fence personally.  Scribe  ""You gain proficiency on Intelligence (Arcana) checks."" To ""scribe"" something isn't wrong, but I think you should change instances of ""scribe"" to ""inscribe"" because it flows better. ""You may inscribe a scroll with a spell you know by spending hours equal to the spell level of the scroll being inscribed.""  Shadow Caster  The first ability should only be attack rolls, and be changed to word in a way that shows it is a used ability and not automatically applied. The saving throws thing I think you meant to add as a bonus to your spell DCs? That might be fine. In my opinion making magical darkness worthless with this feat is a bit powerful when you're also gaining a huge benefit for being within it. I would change it to grant vision of targets within 5 feet instead (acting like a sort of resistance to the magic).  Shadow Rogue  Darkvision from a feat is a bit much, don't you think? It may be nice to have as an option, but theres these things called torches, and spells, and if you have them magic items! I also feel this deserves the same treatment as I mentioned in Shadow Caster above.  Shadow Warrior  ""...start your turn in dim light or darker."" Fixed?  Telekinetic  I love this feat, but I immediately though about trying to unsheath an enemy weapon, or set off a grenade on their hip, or pull their hat over their eyes, you get the picture. I think its up to DMs though, not you, to handle that scenario. Maybe add ""...for the purpose of using your interaction, at the DMs discretion."" as a sort of reminder to be cautious how it can be applied.  Thrown Weapon Master  What if I throw a shuriken? Does it still bounce back? And an axe or dagger buried to the hilt in an enemy? It is a cool effect, but its also a bit off too for a lot of thrown weapons. Its a good enough feat without this in my opinion.  Torturer  I would re-word this to make them make a check to move closer (difficult terrain on a failure) rather than just comparing ability scores."
UnearthedArcana,3c4td5,Bluegobln,2,Sun Jul 5 09:33:37 2015 UTC,"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6aL_wzh5tqNbktYMkVrVUx2ZjA  Here is a link to the PDF compendium.  I've checked out all of your great suggestions and implemented most. For the few I left unchanged I'll mention my intent.  Brutal Rogue  I've left his unchanged after playtesting the feature. The player absolutely loves this feature. He reminds me about it frequently (which is good because I can forget) and is never hard on me when I forget. Him reminding me helps the feature not slow down the game. In terms of power, with a proficiency of +3, he frequently only triggers the feature on creatures that have been damaged 3 or more times. This roughly puts it in line with a +1 to damage, less for creatures with more hit points.  Dexterous Grappler  The intention of the feature is one extra grapple attempt when already attempting to grapple (kind of like how offhand attacks work. It is hard to read because I tried to keep with the game's terminology of a grapple being a modified attack.  Field Medic  Rather than the stipulation (which you're right, could be cheesed), the distance was decreased, direction requirement kept, and requirement to stabilize removed. The alternative would be to only allow the movement if one could stabilize at the end but that does work for any strange interruptions of the movement.  Light Weapon Master  I removed the die size increase. Doing the math though, bonuses to minimum roll give such pathetic increases to average damage I upped that die size. The wording should now include the hand crossbow ;)  Savant  My wording on this one gave off the wrong intention. If you chose, say athletics, you get a +1 to athletics ability checks (representing you extreme skill (like expertise)). It does not apply to all strength ability checks. Sadly I can't just say ""+1 to the chosen skill's skill checks."" I tried to find a better may to word it.  Telekinetic  In my opinion, all of your examples would be considered an action. I threw in a line to clarify it means the interaction action, not interaction in general.  Thrown Weapon Master  Changed it to on a miss. Make more sense? I've never been anal on extreme realism but if something seems ridiculous I try to fix it.  Torturer  Because of how frequently the feature is used I thought making a check every round would get really annoying. Would it be worth it to limit its use and implement a roll?  Thanks again for all of your feedback. I really appreciate it. If you use any of it I'd love to know how it goes (for testing porpoises)."
UnearthedArcana,3c4td5,Kryxx,2,Sun Jul 5 17:21:35 2015 UTC,"Awesome, and fully awesome on the feedback feedback.  For TWM, I dig that. Its still a sort of magical effect but hey, at least its considerably more sensible now. I suppose one could consider the weapons on a chain of some kind, or a rope. I definitely want this for one of my players (though they won't be taking a feat from anywhere except the PHB in this campaign). She frequently uses her dwarf's hand axes and javelines to great effect.  For Torturer you're absolutely right, that would be annoying. I somehow thought of it above then forgot that line of reasoning later on lol.  Did you come up with that whole compendium yourself?"

UnearthedArcana,3c4td5,eir411,6,Sun Jul 5 23:55:33 2015 UTC,The goal here was to create atleast one feat for every mechanical playstyle. Let me know if I didn't cover something.
UnearthedArcana,3c4td5,Mechanatrix,3,Sat Jul 4 20:17:24 2015 UTC,"I love these, they are great! Mustachiod is probably my favorite of the bunch!"
UnearthedArcana,3c4td5,momomo544,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:41:48 2015 UTC,Mustachioed is far too powerful on allowing another attunement slot alone
UnearthedArcana,3c4td5,Kevin5953,4,Sat Jul 4 23:25:25 2015 UTC,"The feat was jokingly buffed to get my players to consider taking such a silly feat. Ultimately, that feature depends on your campaign. Mine rarely uses a DMG magic item (I make my own less potent versions) so the extra attunement slot isn't amazing at my table."
UnearthedArcana,3c4td5,robklg159,3,Sun Jul 5 00:01:14 2015 UTC,It can be especially useful if you use the BTN magic items. They usually require some form of attunement.
UnearthedArcana,3c4td5,thomar,2,Sun Jul 5 01:36:31 2015 UTC,No regrets on taking that feat.
UnearthedArcana,3c4td5,thomar,5,Sun Jul 5 04:38:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think I'll be asking my DM when a ""+5 to BDSM"" will apply..."
UnearthedArcana,3c4td5,Bluegobln,4,Sat Jul 4 22:17:43 2015 UTC,Whip master  You gain a +5 to BDSM   ಠ_ಠ
UnearthedArcana,3c4td5,Kryxx,2,Sun Jul 5 09:03:28 2015 UTC,"I don't have enough time to browse at the moment, but I'd love to hear others' feedback on this! At a quick glance it looks cool!"

UnearthedArcana,3c4td5,Grobanought,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:06:01 2015 UTC,Dervish gives +2 damage? Seems overpowered.
UnearthedArcana,3c4td5,Betzlalel,2,Sat Jul 4 22:56:51 2015 UTC,An ability score increase gives +1 damage and +1 to hit. A +1 bonus to hit is roughly equivalent to +1 damage (as exemplified by the archery/dueling fighting styles).
UnearthedArcana,3c4qzo,AshenGT,2,Sat Jul 4 19:44:56 2015 UTC,"Does a Mad Bomber use apply to one attack with Eldritch Blast or does it apply to every attack in a single casting of EB?  Also, I'm not sure how the Explosives oriented features (Mad Bomber, Explosives Novice, and I assume Disruptive Impact) tie into the flavor of this type of Patron. GOO warlocks are about mentally being disturbed by an eldritch horror allowing them to touch minds of their victims, Fiend locks have made a bargain with a fiend for dark blessings of corrupted power fueled by hellfire, and Archfey locks are tied to creature of the Feywild which bequeath  ancient knowledge of Awe inspiring capabilities that manipulate the emotions of the ill fated.   GOO = Unimaginable psychic disturbance Fiend = Classic faustian deal Archfey = Dangerous whimsical trickery Disruptor = Explosives?   I think you actually touched better upon the theme with Unseen Observer. Maybe more of the abilities and patron spells might be better suited in making the Warlock better at intrigue, sowing discontent and chaos through subterfuge."
UnearthedArcana,3c4qzo,Mazjerai,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:38:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback!  The Mad Bomber feature applies to every missile in a single casting.  The union between the flavor of the Patron and the explosives in the kit were a big pain point for me as I fiddled around with this. In the end, I decided that it worked well because the explosives are supposed to be for mass battlefield disruption. In the same vein, the expanded spell list contains many spells that disrupt the battle field in one way or another.  It's funny, in /r/dnd, a few people were pointing out how Unseen Observer doesn't fit."
UnearthedArcana,3c4qzo,the_singular_anyone,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:04:58 2015 UTC,"The Mad Bomber feature applies to every missile in a single casting.   Oh, what. That's contrary to how I re-read it in my edit. Dang that OP."
UnearthedArcana,3c4qzo,the_singular_anyone,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:57:26 2015 UTC,"Yah, maybe I should reconsider. But I was hoping it would be balanced due to you still having to make an attack roll against your main target.   Maybe I should add a save for the surrounding people to suffer half effect?"
UnearthedArcana,3c4qzo,the_singular_anyone,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:30:46 2015 UTC,"main target   Wait. Wait.  Jesus God, I just realized. Each of these things doesn't target a maximum of four people. Each of them targets a maximum of 9 people for a spammable AoE cantrip that deals Eldritch Blast damage to a potential 36 different targets.  Worse yet, the damage of the AoE can overlap, meaning that you can do EB damage to a single target up to four times.  For example, if you had 4 creatures standing in a 2x2 square you could do 4d10+20 (assuming 20 Cha) to each creature as a cantrip that you can repeat four times.  If this was the level 14 feature and didn't list Eldritch Blast by name, it would be more okay, but it'd still require a serious nerf and some listed saves."
UnearthedArcana,3c4qzo,the_singular_anyone,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:47:15 2015 UTC,"Well, if you miss against the main target, it does nothing. And if you hit (with 1 missile) it's no guarantee that other missiles will hit, assuming higher levels. In addition it's only 1d10 damage per missile. The fact that Eldritch Blast requires an attack role would make it less brutal.  If you're ever in an encounter with 36 people in convenient 9-square formations, then yes, this can do 1d10 to each person. However, 1d10 isn't a lot of damage when you get high in level, it's barely any."
UnearthedArcana,3c4qzo,Pixie1001,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:02:02 2015 UTC,"The words ""as a cantrip you can spam"" are important here, as are the words ""overlapping damage from multiple AoEs"".  Also any warlock with this ability would absolutely take Agonizing Blast for the +Cha to damage.  Also also, you need a saving throw for AoEs because that's how literally everything in 5e does it. Consistency is important, and you shouldn't be auto-hit with something because the AC of the guy next to you sucks. Look at the spell Ice Knife in the Elemental Evil supplement for an idea of how this can go down.  Lastly: None of this matters because it's way out of whack with the balance of the other level 1 abilities. Compare this ability to a single round of Charm/fear, a few hitpoints when you drop a guy, or telepathic speech.  This is a big-league ability. I recommend watering it down and introduce it as either a pact-specific invocation or a level 14 offensive feature."
UnearthedArcana,3c4qzo,Lord_of_Hydras,2,Sun Jul 5 22:00:10 2015 UTC,"Mad Bomber is mad overpowered.   EB is the gold standard that warlock DPR is measured against. You're giving each ""hit"" of it the potential to attack up to four targets, for a maximum of sixteen targets with 1d10+Cha on a cantrip when it's maximized. It's so obscenely good, there's hardly a reason to ever so anything else (except Cloudkill, which is pretty equally ridiculous with how Warlocks manage slots).  You also don't say what kind of saves the characters in the EB blast radius would need to make, but that's really a secondary concern to the whole Mad Bomber thing being grossly overpowered.  EDIT: Ah, I see what you're trying to get at - each use only fires a single bolt, which attacks its area. So if you use it at sixth level, it still only fires the one EB bolt, not the two it normally would - you can just use the ability in this way twice per short rest, but only once at a time.  EDIT EDIT: This is not the case, it's just as bad as I originally thought. The stuff under this still applies, though.  Still overpowered, though. Look at other level 1 pact abilities. The only one that does anything combat-adjacent is Fiend pact, and that's only giving you a couple of hitpoints when you drop a guy.  This also makes the assumption that you get Eldritch Blast (which is not mandatory, believe it or not) and almost exclusively benefits warlocks that would be using EB, i.e. not Bladelocks. The other first level features benefit all pact boons evenly, your first level should do that as well."
UnearthedArcana,3c4pev,StriderT,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:30:10 2015 UTC,"I think that with the way you intended this, it's pretty fine.  However, there are a few things that are overpowered, and a few things that could be game-breaking with very little effort.  As a general class overview, it definitely feels different from the druid and the cleric, which is good.  However, I'm not totally sold on the Spiritual Guide mechanic; the fact that you can only have one active at a time is kind of a bummer.  The Blessing Giver feature definitely alleviates this, but it almost feels like it should come earlier, like with the first Spiritual Guide Improvement.  I've only played 5e with the modified rest rules (short rest is 8 hours, and long rest is a week), so the duration of the spiritual guide would definitely be a problem for those types of games (unless you actually mean cycle, in that it'll keep refreshing).  The Spirit Speaking benefit granting advantage on all skill checks that they're proficient in is huge for level 1.  Maybe if it can only be done a certain number of times per day and only lasts for a certain duration, that'd be nice, but as it is, there's no reason for them to not stop for 10 minutes whenever they enter a new ""area"" and effectively never lose those benefits.  (Also, on a flavor note, why would they have advantage on Athletics checks if they're proficient in that?  Did the spirits hook them up with 'roids?)  With the spirit guides, it's not clear to me whether the order must be decided first, or if you just need to pick the first one and then decide the next one upon each short rest.  It's also not immediately clear that they can't switch guides before the 8 hours are up until the description of the Guide Change feature.  (On a related note, what's the flavor for that?  The shaman doesn't have the spiritual mojo to get it to leave?)  Lastly, I kind of alluded to this earlier, but you keep referring to it as ""your cycle,"" yet it doesn't really seem cyclical.  If you go for a week or something without a long rest, would you keep getting those benefits?  Since it's such an integral class feature, it would make sense to me that they would.  Also, does Guide Change still require a short rest to activate?  Seance is ridiculously overpowered.  A high level shaman could cast wish without expending a spell slot, and even a mid-level one could spam Mass Cure Wounds for infinite healing during a short rest.  I think that the Gift of Possession is way overpowered.  One only needs to prepare greater restoration to have the ability to regain all lvl 1-4 spell slots for between 0 and 2 levels of exhaustion, which are quite manageable.  There's even a 25% chance of keeping a level 5 spell slot.  When you use Blessing Giver, can you still have a different guide?  Does the cycle ""skip"" over the empty spot, or would the location in the cycle be an important consideration for deciding which one to give?  Lastly, if you give the currently active spirit (or even one that already was used), would it last for the full 8 hours for them?  For Improved Medicinal Knowledge, that would make it a lot harder to kill anyone in their group.  I'd consider putting a restriction or a penalty with it (for instance, the witch doctor would need to invoke a spirit which would bestow exhaustion or something on the target).  For the Oracle, I'm not familiar with the lingering wounds table, and it's not in the PHB index.  You ought to provide a reference (if it's a WotC thing) or reproduce it (if it's a common homebrew thing).  For Omen Speaker, they can expend any spell slot, yet there's no benefit to doing anything beyond a 1st level spell slot.  Also, this might be overpowered if a Rogue is in the party (since they'd autmoatically get their Sneak Attack).   You really need to reword Future Sight - no DM would be happy if they were given a free success on an impossible skill check.  I'd give them advantage on their next skill check, or can take the higher of 10 or their d20 roll or something.  Why would the Omen Speaker feature consume a spell slot, yet still have a limited number of uses?  That's just two ways to limit its usage.  The usage of Revelation is weird.  When is the action spent?  It clearly isn't when they're reduced to 0 hp, since the shaman is a valid target.  If it can be before combat, then there's no reason for to take any time at all.  From a balance perspective, I don't understand why a creature can only benefit from it once when clone and revivify can be used infinitely (although the restriction does have a precedent with wish).  Also, what does a revelation about how the universe works have to do with coming back from death?  I'd buy it if the revelation were about the target's destiny and the timing of their death, and perhaps if the Oracle used their abilities to rewrite their fate, but that's just me.  Level 18 is almost a dead level, except for what is basically a ribbon ability.  I'd change it so that the Spiritual Guide Improvement is level 18, so that they can have the ability score increase at level 19.  Which reminds me, I think this is the only class that doesn't get an ability score increase at level 19.  A lot of the spirit guides just don't seem balanced.  In particular:   The O'Waho guide seems ridiculously game-changing for something that's available at such a low level.  (On the other hand, it only comes into play if you expect to be dying...) I think that Rarnarnn should provide resistance instead of immunity to poison damage; I can't think of any other PC feature that provides a damage immunity.   I don't think that Pakasing should provide infinite uses of a second level spell slot when the character is only level 7.  (I could be convinced otherwise about that, considering that Warlocks can get levitate at level 9).   Why thaumaturgy instead of druidcraft for cantrips?  They both occupy the same niche, but I would've figured the nature-y one would be better than the cleric-y one.  I guess it just depends on whether you think of spirits as being stuff in nature, or supernatural divine beings.  I don't understand why they'd get a lot of the purely arcane spells, like prestidigitation or mage hand.  I can get that they walk the line between being druids and clerics, but I don't see why they'd have those quintessential arcane spells.  Lastly, on the first page, there's no need for the apostrophe in ""Channelers."""
UnearthedArcana,3c4pev,krispykremeguy,2,Mon Jul 6 03:39:22 2015 UTC,"Wow! Great post, and great feedback. I appreciate it a great deal!  So, that said, just some comments about things that have changed since I've posted this  -The Spirit Guides were not balanced for the variant rest rules--most classes are not, I find, so you are right that things are weird for that.  -After the few cycle, you have to take a logn rest to start it over or you lose the benefits, because the cycle is broken.  -Spirit Speaking was HEAVILY retooled. When I post the updated version in a few days, you'll see that.  -Guide Change lets you dispel your current Spiritual Guide in favor for another one. It's basically skipping ahead if needed once.  -Seance wording was updated. You dont' get infinite casts; you get one casts of a spell as a ritual when you use it.   -I'm fairly sure Greater Restoration is not in the Shaman spelllist for this exact reason.  -You can't give an active spirit, and when you give another spirit you skip over that.  -Doing a medicine check in the middle of combat is not the most practical thing to do. It's a high risk to do it during combat, where you then get targeted.  -There will be a page number for the DMG lingering wounds table offered up.  -The automatic attacks have been removed in favor for advantage in Omen Speaker. And while you can give away a low level spell-slot, you still only have so many spell slots. This has also been changed to a short or long rest ability, not numerous times per each one.  -Future Sight is being worked on.  -Omen Sight is meant to have many limits on it because it is a very powerful skill, and meant flavor wise to be very taxing.  -The action is spent to bless someone, essentially, and kicks in when they drop to 0 hp within 0 minute. Revivfy has downsides, and costs a spell slot, clone is inferior in other ways, so both can't be really compared to this. Also, the Revelation is generally towards something that has to do with the secrets of the universe--such as life or death, which then allows their magic to bless the target.  -18 is the same as a Druid or Monk ability of a similar level. It's not meant to be a huge boost like that, since it is ribbon based, and the fact that you get more spell slots at this. Not every level should contain a huge spike in power, etc.  -It does not get an ability score increase at 19. This is intended, as a trade off for the power of 4th-tier Spiritual Guides  -O'Waho is really strong for 8 hours if you are in constant battle. But it's only 8 hours, and it's very situational.  -Because all other PC features are perm. This is only for 8 hours, thus it is stronger.  -Pakasing has been reworked in the update.  -Thought about druidcraft, but wanted thaum because the spirits are focused on making miracles through you. But your argument here can be debated for just about any spell list, so.  -The Spirits move things for them--mage hand. The Spirits fix things--prestidigitation.  -I've fixed that typo.  Again, thanks for the feedback! Was great :D"
UnearthedArcana,3c4pev,krispykremeguy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:51:11 2015 UTC,"Alright, glad to have a lot of responses to my feedback so quickly!  I just want to continue on one point - the greater restoration not being on the spell list.  Since they get Gift of Possession at level 10, they could multiclass Shaman 11/Cleric 9 (or Druid 9, or Bard 9) and have access to greater restoration.  That's kind of a specific build that misses out on a lot, but it still seems exploitable (unless you made Gift of Possession level 12+)."
UnearthedArcana,3c4pev,krispykremeguy,2,Mon Jul 6 11:15:37 2015 UTC,"While you could do that, you would be sacrificing a lot from both Cleric and Shaman, especially since you wouldn't be able to use that until you are fairly ""high level"" with the rest of the party. So while yes, you could baptize yourself of the exhaustion, I don't think it is the most practical combo! But, the idea is noted, and I'll toss it around a bit for when I post up the update :)"
UnearthedArcana,3c009d,repeat2k,2,Fri Jul 3 15:10:53 2015 UTC,Mighty caster and find familiar could be a strange combo.
UnearthedArcana,3c009d,purefire,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:11:11 2015 UTC,Can you explain what you mean?
UnearthedArcana,3c009d,ReillocSW,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:42:51 2015 UTC,Because you can use your familiar to deliver a spell with a range of touch.  This feat would allow a caster with a familiar to deliver all their ranged spells.
UnearthedArcana,3c009d,so_kairotic,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:55:07 2015 UTC,Mind you this only works for damage dealing spells that require an attack roll. But I will keep that in mind for version 1.2.
UnearthedArcana,3c009d,IWantToFishIt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:36:15 2015 UTC,"I question Drink like a Demon as a feat. Feats are fairly rare and somewhat powerful, and while I'm all for creating out of combat feats, this one is pretty specific and not very useful outside of a single act."
UnearthedArcana,3c009d,Toodleypops,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:58:11 2015 UTC,Actor and linguist are two out of combat feats that provide interesting bonuses.
UnearthedArcana,3c009d,13sparx13,2,Fri Jul 3 22:45:47 2015 UTC,But are way more powerful.
UnearthedArcana,3c009d,Toodleypops,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:18:38 2015 UTC,Would you suggest that it is underpowered then? If so I will take that into consideration for v1.2.
UnearthedArcana,3bvved,Baldr12,5,Thu Jul 2 16:01:44 2015 UTC,"Compared to the other level 6 paths, I think Path of the Gryphon is the least interesting/powerful. You could probably add an extra effect, but I'm not sure what.  Storm Style has no synergy with any of the paths. It encourages two weapon fighting, but the Gryphon and Manticore paths encourage two-handing, whilst the Dragonturtle path requires a free hand. I'd alter either one of the paths (probably Path of the Gryphon) to something more functional for a two-weapon style fighter. That said, two-weapon fighting with these blades would be VERY powerful considering its damage die. Possibly unbalanced, but maybe offset by how squishy the sorcerer will remain in melee. Still, 8d8 + 10 damage per round isn't something to sniff at. That's an average of 46 damage per round, on par with Eldritch Blast cannons and dex fighters, neither of whom have quite the utility of sorcerers.  Minor things: references to levels in the Siverain class should instead refer to Sorcerer levels.  All that said, I like it :) it's exactly what a 'fighty' sorcerer should be -- a sorcerer who also has an option to wade in and hit things, rather than trying to over-emphasise the fighting."
UnearthedArcana,3bvved,Glinting,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:54:19 2015 UTC,Thanks very much!   I could give the Gryphon Path some mobility utility (based on the fact the the Gryphon dives to attack)  Regarding the Storm Style I can remove the ability bonus to the second attack or the benefits of the feat.  Or I could make the Volcano Style a two-handed choice (powerful enough like the Storm one)
UnearthedArcana,3bvved,niXx3n,2,Thu Jul 2 20:14:57 2015 UTC,I actually think that storm style is fine as it is. Any more buffs it would be too powerful and 8d8+10 at level 17 is fine. The downsides to being in melee highly outweigh any potential strengths of being a consistent damage dealer.
UnearthedArcana,3bvved,Galiphile,2,Thu Jul 2 20:38:57 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  Page 1, Weaveblade, 3rd paragraph should read Disadvantage."
UnearthedArcana,3bvved,Whitemanwithafro,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:05:51 2015 UTC,Thanks!
UnearthedArcana,3bvved,SketchingScars,2,Thu Jul 2 18:12:49 2015 UTC,"This is an extremely interesting take on the sorcerer Class, I love it!"
UnearthedArcana,3bvved,wodansring,2,Thu Jul 2 19:38:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely one of the most interesting homebrews to date. I especially enjoy the fact that you've taken Starwars' Jedi and created them in a way that could fit into nearly any campaign. I think it's very well done.  As others say, Path of the Gryphon seems awfully lackluster compared to others. In combination with a second path or style, it becomes much more apparent as a critical fail negation, which I would also say helps with the 1st level Origin bonus of being able to expend spell slots for damage and have that damage land with slightly more reliable hits. This definitely allows a player to expect that they'll never really be put in a full-on bad situation. However, the only issue I have with this is that, as I said, it negates critical fails, which some DMs may see as detrimental to variance of play. Occasionally, you may want your characters to critical fail as it can allow opportunities to put them in precarious situations for them to fight their way out of and perform feats of glorious recovery. Just my two copper there.  The only other thing is that, as others have said, Storm Style seems to be a bit out of place. While I definitely approve of the two weapon fighting style being there in the first place, I feel that there's nothing that has any synergy with it aside from Path of the Dragonturtle's bonus action Blade Ward cantrip. The only issue with this is that a player can receive only a single bonus action per round and that attacking with an off-hand weapon is also a bonus action, so the choice would have to be made to make use of the style or the path. Perhaps you may want to see about brewing a fourth path for more outright in-the-fray capabilities that will synergize with Storm Style, or instead possibly give a slight AC bonus while wielding an off-hand Weaveblade as part of Storm Style. I definitely think you should be careful though, as you don't want to tip the scales too far. What you have right now is very balanced as far as I can tell as a whole. You just need something to synergize with Storm Style, in my opinion."

UnearthedArcana,3byb65,Ammastaro,4,Fri Jul 3 04:00:01 2015 UTC,"Frankly, classes are much more than, ""How To Deal Damage"".  You need to find a niche that no other class fills. You need to understand how that class thematically fills that niche. You need to explain why a person pursues that class path, Not a player. Players run the gamut of pure RPers and math Min/maxers.   A person, as in the character. A character does not end up developing in a class because ""I want to do more damage"". Classes have far much more depth than that.  Understanding what niche your class fulfills and why characters pursue your class will afford you a broader understand of what features to put in to your class.   Combat/Exploration/Interaction are the 3 pillars of DnD class feature design. Incorporate all three, and you're well on your way towards fleshing out a class."

Here's my advice since you decided to go ahead and pry though.  My advice would be ""make it more interesting"" in this circumstance that means redo the entire thing from the bottom up because I don't like it at all. It's entire mechanic is focused around damage only and has no flavor input besides that. It's made for power gamers which is fine but it's definitely not fun IMO...

UnearthedArcana,3bw0fa,LordFluffy,3,Thu Jul 2 16:41:12 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, the invocations are defiantly important I feel, but you should maybe also add a clause about choosing Bludgeoning, Piercing or Slashing Resistance. They're a butt to better than the elemental ones and most enemies will probably be using similar weapons, so you would basically just take half damage from almost all sources."

Having resistance to piercing damage would mean that around 80% of the damage dished out by those enemies would be halved. It isn't really a choice. The Aegis would be much more interesting if you had to choose from the more exotic options."
UnearthedArcana,3bw0fa,Pixie1001,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:43:49 2015 UTC,"The Aegis would be much more interesting if you had to choose from the more exotic options.   But less useful.

UnearthedArcana,3bw0fa,Mazjerai,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:39:04 2015 UTC,"I suppose, but you have to remember that most of the other pacts simply supply additional options as opposed to raw advantages.  The familiar gives some interesting out of combat options (which I suppose is an objective improvement, although not a combat one).  The blade pact allows you to attack in melee, but doesn't actually increase your damage.  Meanwhile the Tomb gives you more cantrips - but nothing objectively better than your Eldritch Blast combatwise.  Giving a flat passive to a very common resiestance just sounds a lot more useful than some extra versatility :/  Although in saying that, I just looked up the Fiend Patron bonus which is pretty similar and that seems to rank them all as equal. I'd probs just add the clause about Magic and Silvered weapons if you still wanted to keep the flat bonus."

You may not use this invocation again until after you have had a long rest.  My Protection, My Chariot prerequisites: 9th level, Pact of the Aegis You may fly, sitting or standing on your shield, for up to an hour. You may break this time up, but each use takes at least 10 minutes from the total. Once you have used this time, you must take a long rest before you can use it again. You may not be knocked off of your shield, but you may only carry yourself and items up to your encumbrance (you could carry someone in your arms this way).  Aside from the above, this works identically to the effects of the spell fly.    I want to do two more with this, like a movement one (if you are attacked and missed, you may use your reaction to move 10') and one involving some fear effect, but I'm not sure how those should go.

UnearthedArcana,3btihj,Buncs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:50:07 2015 UTC,"Conceptually, these are nice.  For Might Caster, getting to add Strength mod to both spell's attack and bonus might be too much though. Perhaps one of these, but not both? And make the other usable once per short rest?  Combat Medic is very, very powerful -- casting the cantrip as a bonus action AND always imposing disadvantage on opportunity attacks with buff and healing spells. Both of these benefits need to be more limited. Perhaps cantrip-as-bonus-action once per short or long rest? Disadvantage on opportunity attacks for non-cantrip spells and/or for spells that restore hit points only? Also, I would make it +1 to Cha or Wis (...especially as the other benefits are written now, to keep multiclass wizards from dipping cleric and getting crazy healing, crazy amounts of cantrips, and protection from opportunity attacks)."

Putting this out now to get feedback and suggestions.  This part has the basic movement, visibility and combat rules and is largely based on the rules from PHB/DMG but with a few tweaks.    My goal is to make it fun, make the rules fairly ""light"" and intuitive, and to change player options (spells, class features, etc.) as little as possible."
UnearthedArcana,3bt64m,Kryxx,2,Wed Jul 1 23:04:46 2015 UTC,"I use similar rules for disadvantage on athletics: ""Armor that gives disadvantage on stealth also gives disadvantage on Athletics checks to swim""  Here are the rest of my Underwater Combat rules:  Hold Breath  A character who has no air to breathe can hold her breath for 2 rounds per point of Constitution. If a character takes an action, the remaining duration that the character can hold her breath is reduced by 1 round. After this period of time, the character must make a DC 10 Constitution check in order to continue holding her breath. The check must be repeated each round, with the DC increasing by +1 for each previous success. When the character fails one of these Constitution checks, she begins to suffocate. In the first round, she falls unconscious (0 hit points). In the following round, she gains a death failure. In the third round, she suffocates.  Melee Attacks Underwater  When making a melee weapon attack, a creature has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.  Ranged Attacks Underwater  A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).  Attacks from Land  Characters swimming, floating, or treading water on the surface, or wading in water at least chest deep, have three-quarters cover (+5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws) from opponents on land. A completely submerged creature has total cover against opponents on land.  Fire  Nonmagical fire (including alchemist's fire) does not burn underwater. Spells or spell-like effects with the fire descriptor create a bubble of steam instead of its usual fiery effect, and creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.  Spellcasting Underwater  Casting spells while submerged can be difficult for those who cannot breathe underwater A creature that cannot breathe water must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 13 + spell level) to cast a spell underwater. Failure means the spell fizzles. Creatures that can breathe water are unaffected and can cast spells normally. Some spells might function differently underwater, subject to GM discretion.  These are essentially ported rules from Pathfinder with DCs adjusted. I also got rid of swim speed allowing any melee weapons underwater - imo there is a reason all underwater creatures (with swim speeds) use tridents and the like.  Hope that helps."

UnearthedArcana,3bt64m,Kryxx,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:58:08 2015 UTC,Slashing vs bludgeon. It has a very different resistance.  In pf they unarmed has penalties so there is precedent. Not sure how natural attacks are treated in pf- I forget.

I assume you're just putting them here for reference. Holding breath: I found 1 minute + con mod to be too simplistic. I prefer PF's 2 rounds per con score. A Con of 10 would be 2 minutes, a Con of 14 would be 2.8 minutes. Similar, but better imo. I also remove 1 round per action. More complex. Vision underwater: Nice measurement for each level.

UnearthedArcana,3bt64m,Kryxx,2,Thu Jul 2 18:38:58 2015 UTC,"We encountered seeing underwater for the first time in my session. Your seeing underwater rules are a bit unclear. Lets presume a creature has darkvision 60 - how far can they see at night time if they are <100ft below? Presumably darkvison doesn't just ignore this graph, or you're just making the graph to punish humans.  I'm thinking about: ""Darkvision range is reduced by 1/4 of the original value  for each depth level (Example 60 darkvision is 45 darkvision at <100 ft in darkness)."""
UnearthedArcana,3bt64m,Kryxx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:29:38 2015 UTC,"The vision rules here is a slightly more clear/fleshed out version of the rules in the DMG on page 117.  I don't think that the vision ranges are any more punishing to humans that RAW for standard vision.  Example: underground in a dungeon, a character with darkvision can see clearly for a range of 60 feet.  But a human using a torch can only see clearly for 20 feet (and dimly for an additional 20 feet).    The issue is that the light sources that a human character would normally depend upon are not viable underwater, so some other (magical or alchemical) alternative probably needs to be provided.  I'm not really seeing how reducing the range of darkvision for non human characters really helps this."
UnearthedArcana,3bt64m,Kryxx,2,Mon Jul 6 16:02:07 2015 UTC,Normal characters have their vision limited significantly for being underwater. Why wouldn't the same be true for Darkvision? Why does the water's effects on the eye not effect Darkvision?

Also, the 10th level ability of the Aether Warlock archetype could probably be abused by simply using it on low CR rabble to effectivly give you an extra spell slot - something that's WAY better than what the prexisting archetype's would get. Although, spellcasters are kinda nerfed here anyway by the whole touch zone thing, so it's probably ok - I mean, they'll be limited by capsules anyway. The Eldritch Gun invocation also seemed to be kinda shitty given that you wouldn't get anything out of hex or Agonising Blast - unless there's some kind of rapid fire ability I'm missing.  I'm also curious as to what counts as magic - for instance, could a Nephilim, someone who's supposedly very close to the Aether Lords, be an Aether Warlock despite their racial forbidding it. (Unless I totally misread that)  Altogether though, the lore itself makes it well worth the read even if all the classes were broken to shit anyway though XD (Which they definitely aren't)"
UnearthedArcana,3bsh93,Pixie1001,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:16:58 2015 UTC,"The Shell Caster thing, you've got a point. But I've been wondering what stops a Wizard from making scrolls the same way? Eh, maybe make a hard cap equal to Intelligence modifier per day.   For the Warlock - yeah I feel it needs some tweaking. The 10th level looks likes it only works per short rest, so I guess instead of 2 spell slots, you'll have 3. It does sound too good.   Yeah, I'm not entirely sure what to do with the Invocation either - as Eldritch Blast is so damned good, - you still get hex once with the invocation though... I guess it's only strictly better (palatable) with Massive Damage rules (DMG p273). What do you suggest as a suitably cool effect instead?   You know, I didn't think about the Nephlim and the Aether Lords. I would probably allow it - though strictly speaking Warlocks and Digital Souls don't get along.   I'm really looking forward to critiques on the Specialist and Ranger Remix. I don't know how I felt about those in terms in balance - I need more eyes looking over those.  But thanks! Seriously."
UnearthedArcana,3bsh93,Pixie1001,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:12:35 2015 UTC,"You're welcome :)  I'll look over the Specialist and Explorer tommorrow in more detail and give you my two cents if you'd like - full classes are obviously a fair bit harder to judge since there's so much materiel and no real benchmark to compare each feature too - although the Specilist seemed pretty similar to a warlock at first glance.  As for the pact of the Warlock I'll have to sleep on it, although maybe instead of a spellslot they could shoot out a bolt of energy based in the amount of damage absorbed as opposed to giving you a spell slot, which is a bit much. So sort of like a free low spell slot level use of Hellish Rebuke, but with Lighting damage. It would be pretty fun trying to absorb as much damage as possible for the most damaging counter attack possible without your shield cracking and giving you nothing.  And I'll have to re-read it but I'm pretty sure Hex works on a per hit basis - so it's actually pretty crazy damage when you get to four attacks."
UnearthedArcana,3bsh93,Pixie1001,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:51:25 2015 UTC,"In regards to the Eldritch Bullet Invocation: The new invocation only goes off once, versus 4 times with a normal eldritch blast, but the difference is that on creatures with resistance (incredibly rare) and massive damage rules, 4 small attacks are strictly worse than 1 large attack. Not a lot of people use Massive damage rules anyway.  I could make it so that when you make a ranged weapon attack with your Pact of the Gun, you can add maybe a 1d4 force or Charisma modifier force damage on to it?  The Bullet invocation right now is a massive boost to anyone who would have taken a 2 level dip to into warlock so at level 20, a fighter might make 8 ranged weapon attacks, with one of those attacks adding 4d10 force. But I dunno, just some thoughts on it.   Oh I really like that idea of a free Hellish Ruke sort of ability."
UnearthedArcana,3bsh93,Pixie1001,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:16:29 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I was thinking over the Gun Pact whilst I slept and I feel the real need for Gun Pact is that ranged weapon characters like the fighter have had their base damage effectively trippled as a result of the massive damage guns do.  As such Eldritch Blast really needs something to keep it on par. So, I'd do it a but like this-  Pact of the Gun-  When you choose this pact boon, choose a firearm of your choice – you must bond with it with an hour long ritual in which you know every intimate part of the weapon. Once you have finished the ritual, you are proficient with the chosen weapon, and may use it as an arcane focus.  In addition, when you cast the Eldritch Blast cantrip through your Pact Weapon you may choose to make each beam counts as a seperate Ranged Weapon Attack through the weapon, although you may not add your Dexterity Mod to the damage. This attack benefits from all on hit effects your Eldritch Blast would, including Invocations such as Agonising Blast and Repelling Blast.    For the Invocation, I'd let them add Force damage to their shots and let them ignore the Reload and Power-Pack properties of their Pact Weapon when firing it. Maybe let them create a small temporary touch zone around them for like a minute a day as well maybe. You could call it Conduit.  I still need to look through your other classes with all the Augmentation rules though before I can comment on them. Also, for the guns their seemed to be rules for the crazy powerful Maser Guns, but not regular Laser Guns - are they just in the DMG, or did I miss something?"
UnearthedArcana,3brgyr,OwenLeaf,4,Wed Jul 1 15:39:06 2015 UTC,"Ah this one! Funny for it to turn up now. I was recently toying with an Oath with bit more of a ""fiery"" feel to it, like this one, but I just couldn't nail down a theme. Then, I came across your Oath and was surprised at the similarities! I thought you had really good flavour, but I wasn't sure about the features themselves. Since you've posted it up here I'll drop some feedback:  Fiery Weapon: I feel this tramples on Searing Smite, which is already a really cool fire-charged melee attack that Paladins have. If you grant the paladin Searing Smite as an Oath spell at 3rd level, you can open up this Channel Divinity option for something a little different, something that can't be replaced with a magic sword or a spell. I'm thinking of something akin to the Light domain cleric's Radiance of the Dawn option, but deals fire damage instead of radiant.  Turn Outsiders: On par with the other paladin ""Turn"" abilities, no major qualms here. If I were to design this however I might err on the side of Monstrosities, rather than Celestials. But each to their own!  Red Knight's Blessing: This is unique and I kinda like the mechanic promoting the use of the Help action, I'm just not sure this measures up to the auras/features the other Oaths get at 7th level. Also, the 1 round protection from evil and good is a little weird for 5e I think. The other Oath auras have an 'always on' benefit, which gets better in some way as you level up. Here, you must use the Help action in order to receive any benefit, if you don't, it's kind of a dead feature. Oath of Vengeance paladins get a feature that lets them use their reaction for something else, and this works because you're far more likely to have your reaction available than use your turn aiding another creature.  What I would suggest is something a little more generic, has its use in most situations and keeps within the theme of the Oath. How about:             When you or another creature within 10 feet of you makes a melee attack roll with advantage, you can add your Charisma modifier to the creature's damage roll if the attack hits. A creature can benefit from this feature from only one paladin at a time. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.   Haven't put masses of thought into this, just an idea that popped into my head while writing. Mainly put it here just to give an example of a different type of 'always on' feature that benefits you and other creatures.  Out of the Ashes: This is really cool flavour, and totally sets up the theme of the Phoenix Knight at 20th level. It's hard to gauge whether this trumps Undying Sentinel or not, I'm leaning on the side that it does, since you're going to have a lot of unspent hit dice each day to use with this feature. I can't really think of anything balanced to replace this at the moment.. Oh also, getting up from prone only costs movement not any sort of action - so the bonus action get-up-from-prone isn't much of a benefit!  Phoenix Knight: Sweet, you get to turn into a Phoenix! (more or less) I feel like there needs to be far more rules here to handle the transformation, since there's a lot more going on than Avenging Angel. For example, what happens to my equipment when I become a bird? Does it merge into me or drop to the floor? Can I still cast spells and speak in my normal tongue? Does my AC change to something else since it would be weird to have a Phoenix wearing a shield? Am I considered a Large creature? Maybe these are silly questions, but it's a big feature - similar to the Druid's shapeshift ability, and the rules for that take up half a page. I think there's room for a bit more than just granting resistances or advantage. Really play on the fact you're becoming this fiery beast made of radiant light. Perhaps creatures that move within 5 feet of you or start their turn there take 5 fire damage - I imagine it's hot standing near a Phoenix!  Anyway, that's just a few of my thoughts! Overall nice job on the mechanics and flavour. If you know how to use Photoshop this could be a really cool one to make using the PHB template."
UnearthedArcana,3brgyr,Ryluin,3,Wed Jul 1 19:12:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the awesome feedback! I'll definitely look over it and try incorporating some of your additions to the next revision.   the bonus action get-up-from-prone isn't much of a benefit!   It was intended to allow you to avoid the disadvantages of being prone until the next round, but looking back I see it's redundant unless you were dropped by an readied attack or something to cause you to not have enough movement left.   however I might err on the side of Monstrosities   The Oath of the Eternal Flame was originally conceived as something sort of like the Vengeance Paladin except they only cared about preserving the balance between good and evil. If evil threatens the balance, they will join good and combat it, and vice versa. As Celestials are the epitome of good, that was why the feature functions as it does. I may look into changing it though.   Searing Smite as an Oath spell at 3rd level   Good idea, I'll probably do this.   What I would suggest is something a little more generic, has its use in most situations and keeps within the theme of the Oath. How about:   When you or another creature within 10 feet of you makes a melee attack roll with advantage, you can add your Charisma modifier to the creature's damage roll if the attack hits. A creature can benefit from this feature from only one paladin at a time. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.    I like this and will probably use it.

UnearthedArcana,3brgyr,the_singular_anyone,2,Wed Jul 1 21:48:51 2015 UTC,"Sorry, meant to comment on this earlier, but my cell phone died mid post. Here's me retyping what I wrote:  I actually think this class option is pretty awesome, I'd definitely let it run at my table, especially given that I've always been a fan of elemental paladins.   Minor quibbles:   Red Knight's Blessing doesn't have a range on it. You could bap an enemy with the aid action, run all the way to the moon somehow, and still be able to attack the enemy when your friend attacks it on their turn. This could be working as intended, but you'd want to clarify in either case.  With Out of the Ashes, I'm naturally leery of anything involving hit die mechanics (after my first pact homebrew), as hit dice are a relatively self-contained resource and poking them too much can have serious effects on out-of-combat healing. Still, this looks minor enough, but my major concern would be with the paladin hoarding hit dice for use with this feature, as they're effectively immortal as long as they have a hit die left, and seeking healing exclusively through potions or a pocket cleric. I'm not sure how this balances against paladin abilities of the same level, but for the sake of keeping the paladin using hit dice for their original intended purpose as well as this ability, I'd probably limit this feature to once per short rest.  You may consider Photoshopping this into something resembling an actual PHB entry - doing so makes it easier to print, and tends to get people more interested in seeing the content of your class. Try going with this fine tutorial on how to do it if you're interested. If you don't have Photoshop, I hear CS2 is free if you jump through some hoops, and if you're not interested in hoop-jumping, GIMP should be fine for this.    Other than that, good job! As I said, minor quibbles, no major glaring balance issues. I'll keep an eye out for any other work or future drafts of this you throw out there, it's quality stuff."

The relic could be a painful reminder of her lost beauty, so the drow wish to either destroy or corrupt it to please their god.     For the robe: Celestial + Wicked makes me think Fallen Angel.  So this could be the shroud of a fallen angel, who subjugated entire countries and tried to overthrow the gods, but was defeated and banished. There is a prophacy that an unfortunate mortal will release the evil and send the world into chaos again. Unfortunately for anyone stumbling upon the shroud, it was once worn by the fallen angel, and a part of its essence is stored in there, through which the angel attepts to corrupt any wearer with the goal of gaining access to our world again.     The shield: Bane + Covetous: This could be a shield of dragon slaying.  Since all dragons are able to fly, the rulers of the plane of air felt threatened by the possibility of an attack by the magical creatures. As a deterent they crafted a powerful artifact. A disk of hollow filagree which blows a tune whenever moved or exposed to a current of air. It is not intended as a shield, but has the rough proportions and effectively indestructible. The shield was placed on the material plane for great heroes to find. The bearer becomes obsessed with wealth - especially the hoards of dragons."

UnearthedArcana,3bsgrb,Bale838,2,Wed Jul 1 23:46:04 2015 UTC,"Tiara: The Drow of the Underdark have strange and powerful magic, and created this Tiara in the name of Lolth. Decorated in cobwebs and spider motifs, this headpiece, when worn, not only allows the wearer to know their exact depth underground, but also speaks in a dark, guttural whisper. If you ate able to make sense of the low mutterings, the tiara is speaking low chants and praises to Lolth.  Robes: These robes are what remains of an old cult to a forgotten god of old. A prophecy was made about the bearer of these robes, and that they would save the world from a terrible cataclysm, or doom it utterly due to earthly temptations. To prepare the Chosen for their trials and tribulations, the High Priests imbued the robes with a curse that strengthens any desire a mortal who wears it has, to learn how to better resist temptation. The cult is long gone, but the robes remain.  I'll think of more soon"

UnearthedArcana,3bsgrb,Cyborgschatz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:28:18 2015 UTC,"For the tiara, I'd tweak the last two features to make them fit. Instead of Delver, make it so that the bearer always knows the direction to the nearest forest, and can usually find the straightest path to get there. Instead of muttering, allow the wearer to hear sounds of the forest while wearing it, including sometimes the sounds of snapping twigs when something's attempting to sneak up on the bearer. The framework is there, you just need to adapt it to fit with what it seems like the theme should be.  I'm having trouble with the next two, but the mace seems workable. It was used my the mad emperor of a fallen empire to slaughter the heirs that he thought were plotting his assassination. It's rumored that it's the only thing that can break the seal on their burial chamber."

They know they need the item to unlock the path to slay evil/find a good relic/escape the tower of an insane mage, but keeping it with them constantly fills them with disgust.  Maybe make it so that only someone with divine powers can bear it or else it would begin to corrupt the holder."

UnearthedArcana,3bq9ca,Autherial,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:23:26 2015 UTC,"It needs some work.   Ki is off a short rest, this means you get at minimum 1 fabricate an hour if you want. 10 second casting time. How many rounds is that? Go with 6 or 12 ""Exceptional"" items should be more specific. I recommend resistance to a damage type or some such. Adding ""You regain these abilities after a long rest"" doesn't mean anything due to where you placed it. They also already cost ki."
UnearthedArcana,3bq9ca,Leuku,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:53:12 2015 UTC,"Its a good point. Do you think it should be limited more? I had originally made this effect without involving the Fabricate spell but then thought it was close enough to the effect I wanted so I just modified it. Edit: Ideally I'd like to ""nerf"" this by making the fabricate effect weaker, not be limiting its frequency of use. I'll think about it. Can this be worded as 2 actions or should it be 12 seconds? I was already thinking of this change because of the slight conflict there. Edit: Going with 1 minute because there are no examples of others in the PHB, its either 1 action or 1 minute, nothing in between that I can find. Underneath is where it is stated the DM can choose how to handle it. I did make a point to state that the effect is not a bonus (such as a weapon +1) but is simply a trait of the item. A sword is not sharper, but it can be lighter weight. A shield might have a mirror finish surface or be particularly resistant to fire, making it a hell of a lot safer to hide behind in a fiery situation than another shield. A DM can even just bypass this and say its treated like Masterwork weapons used to be handled (I wanted to avoid using that term since I think its absent in 5e). Since all +1 weapons and armor are magical I also wanted to clarify this isn't that. Tough keeping this as the least amount of text required. They already cost Ki but you can only use each of the three possible once, and only regain them with a long rest. The illusion map, the ranged fabricate or cure wounds, and your choice of the three level 5 spells. You can't, for example, cast Greater Restoration followed by a Passwall, even if you have enough Ki to do so, because they are part of the same category. You cannot ranged cure wounds followed by a ranged fabricate. Edit: Also note that the cure wounds here costs 4 Ki as well, to try to balance the fact that it is significantly more powerful at range."
UnearthedArcana,3bpgs1,DarionJDiaz,5,Wed Jul 1 02:36:07 2015 UTC,"I think that you should cut down the number of ""+x"" features. They're few and far between in 5e for a reason, because of how significantly they effect the bounded accuracy. I don't have time right now to make specific suggestions, but that's my general feeling."
UnearthedArcana,3bpgs1,Glinting,2,Wed Jul 1 03:35:42 2015 UTC,"I like the overall feel of the class, and as a player I would love to play one.  Balance-wise, I'm quite unsure. I quickly scanned everything, and I'll take an other look an other time, but I feel like he's just really good. Class paths that gives feats: The dual wielder feat is useless witht the two-weapon path. I know lots of classes can give parts of a feat, but I feel like a feat should be ""something more"". I'd love to have some dedicated features for the twoweapon style, that gives something in itself so that I may go and take the feat if I feel like I want to wield two longswords (or rapiers)  d8 HD is fine, the class sucks at saving throws (almost no intelligence save) but thats fine too.  Steel hurricane feature should specifiy that you use a bonus action to make those off-hand attacks. If thats how you meant it to be anyway. Your class doesnt use much bonus action as I see it for now.  Finally, I think you gave it too much of ""everybody"". Throwing the only good feature of the Champion (fighter) with improved critical, the initiative bonus of the champion and bard, as well as Evasion and uncanny dodge from the rogue, finesse on a greatsword, +4 strenght or dex... as well as a very versatile path+stance concept... I just feel like a character playing a swordsman would be better than any other melee class."
UnearthedArcana,3bpgs1,Kayrajh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:49:55 2015 UTC,"I can understand the concerns. I'll look at the weapon supremacy in a little bit and try to trim it down. A greatsword would not get finesse however, as the stance requires you to be wielding a one handed weapon. A longsword could be used in two, but a greatsword would not. I added a quick stipulation that the weapon may not be heavy."

UnearthedArcana,3bpgs1,ruberik,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:36:22 2015 UTC,"On first glance at the title my initial thought is: What makes this different than a fighter?  So I went through and did a quick read, and to me it seems very fun but it seems very close to the same archetype as a fighter, or maybe a subclass. This isn't meant to be negative, but rather a suggestion to either make it more obvious that it is fundamentally different from a fighter or to maybe remake it as a subclass."
UnearthedArcana,3bpgs1,NoobHUNTER777,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:50:21 2015 UTC,"Single Sword Style seems really underpowered. With it, you can use a longsword two-handed to get 1-10 (avg 5.5) base damage with a finesse weapon. You can't use a shield or medium armour, so that seems like the best-case use of the style. On the other hand you could take Dueling Style and use a rapier to get 3-8 (avg 5.5) base damage with a finesse weapon, and use a shield, and (if you want it) medium armour. You're giving up at least two points of AC in exchange for slightly higher variance in your damage dealt, which isn't necessarily desirable, and crits that do two more damage on average. It doesn't seem like it's worth it, unless I'm missing something."
UnearthedArcana,3bpgs1,ruberik,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:47:09 2015 UTC,"I understand the concern. A previous iteration caused it to give you a +2 bonus to AC to compensate for the lack of a shield.  If you don't mind my asking, what direction do you believe it should take?"

UnearthedArcana,3bna23,LordFluffy,3,Tue Jun 30 16:17:48 2015 UTC,"By expending 1 Ki, you may attack with your shield as a thrown weapon. The range is 30/120. If you attack someone within 30, your shield returns to your hand. You may use this ability only once per round, even if you gain multiple attacks (you may make other attacks normally).   What kind of action does this require? Your attack action, or one of the attacks in your attack action?  Center of the Circle: I would reduce the size to 10 feet, since it's kind of like a Paladin's aura.  Expand the Circle: Rather than an AC increase, I think it should merely be a range increase, to 30 feet, like a Paladin's aura.  I made a Fighter subclass for the Cap, as well.  An interesting thing to note is that this subclass doesn't have any defense oriented features whatsoever, except for the ally AC increase.  Otherwise, it's all about making throwing attacks with the shield. I recommend taking cue from my fighter subclass to figure out a more efficient way to dole out the multi shield attacks, e.g. ""At 6th level, can expend an attack and bonus action martial arts attack to make your thrown shield ricochet and attack an additional target within 10 feet of the previous target for each attack expended.  At 11th level, you can use flurry of blows to make your shield ricochet and attack more targets rather than doing what flurry of blows normally does.  Etc."
UnearthedArcana,3bna23,Leuku,2,Tue Jun 30 17:27:40 2015 UTC,"What kind of action does this require? Your attack action, or one of the attacks in your attack action?   As written, it would take one attack of an attack action, but it might be better to write it that it replaces it.    I would reduce the size to 10 feet   Seems reasonable   Rather than an AC increase, I think it should merely be a range increase   I'm not sure, mostly because this is a capstone kind of deal. It should be big and swingy, I think. I might drop the +2 AC in favor of extending the monk's resistances to allies, but I'll need to go look at the PHB to figure out how practical that ends up being.   An interesting thing to note is that this subclass doesn't have any defense oriented features whatsoever, except for the ally AC increase.     By design. Monks get a lot of good defensive bonuses. I didn't want it to be overkill.    I recommend taking cue from my fighter subclass to figure out a more efficient way to dole out the multi shield attacks...   The way you have it written feels more cumbersome to me, actually. I wanted this to work equally well with theater of the mind as well as with grids and maps, which is why I left the wording less specific.   Thanks for the input. I'm planning on bundling up some thoughts; I'll probably put the rewrite there."
UnearthedArcana,3bna23,Eltonbrand,2,Thu Jul 2 16:25:42 2015 UTC,"More of a minor point but   You may bash people with your shield; this does 1d6 bludgeoning damage. Your shield is considered a monk weapon.   Is contradictory. It's either a monk weapon, and uses the monk weapon progression, or it isn't a monk weapon and always deals 1d6 damage."
UnearthedArcana,3bna23,Eltonbrand,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:37:46 2015 UTC,"Many monk weapons have a higher starting damage than the monk damage (short swords are monk weapons, for example, and start at 1d6P). I added this qualification to remove any confusion. One could have them just do whatever the monk attack damage is instead, however.  I wrote up some alternate shield rules and this keeps damage in line with those."

UnearthedArcana,3bna23,micka190,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:11:31 2015 UTC,"I want this.   If any of the attacks miss, the shield falls to the ground.   This is only stated for the multiple-targets attack, but it seems more consistent if it applies to a single-target attack as well. (Another random idea: Allow two targets at level 3, four targets at level 6, and six targets at level 3 -- but recovering your shield at the end of the throw requires that the last target be yourself.)  Recovering your shield by moving and using the one free manipulate-object action isn't that much of a problem in most cases, and could result in some interesting tactical thinking about the terrain you're fighting in.  You could expand the versatility by swapping out some of those abilities for something like ""Spend X ki points and your reaction to block a magic attack with the shield"" (maybe with cooler side effects, like when Thor gets knocked prone by hammering Cap's shield in Avengers 1).  You could also add the Protection fighting style at some point."

Ace of Swords- PC’s favorite or most powerful item becomes intelligent and hostile towards the player. 8 of Wands- PC physically switches gender.(One of my favorites)   Death is interesting you can do a lot with that idea, maybe it doesn't have to be the PC's death, maybe a loved one or friend.

UnearthedArcana,3bekhz,Zephyr1011,3,Sun Jun 28 14:31:06 2015 UTC,"Looking at the core half casters, I think we can see what makes an interesting exclusive spell. Paladin and ranger each have spells from the list of their 'greater' caster, (paladin has some cleric spells, ranger has some druid ones), while the exclusive are all spells that keep a similar tone and style, while incorporating the new emphasis on weaponry. Paladin Smite spells are the clearest example, as they keep the tone of divine power and add in the paladin affinity for melee. Rangers have things like lightning arrow, or conjure volley, (or the arrow trap one whose name escapes me...) all taking the ranger's weaponry and adding the druid's wiles.  With all that in mind, it might help to think of the Magus as a 'sword wizard', in that you should take the style of wizards and bend it to include weaponry as a central focus. I would such to a tone of versatility, of always having the right tools, and an ability to use those tools in new ways. Perhaps a lesser blade barrier/spiritual weapon. Animate blade, perhaps? Or spells that have similar purposes to battlemaster maneuvers. Greater mage armor/displacement aura could be fun.  Think of existing spells and effects that could be reworked and repurposed, there's already a lot of cool shit, you just need to put it together in new ways."

It could have a better name considering only 1/3 weapons is actually a blade. I don't think weapon specialization is a good idea for a fighting style. It's basically just a better dueling style with any weapon but you can never change your mind. None of the other styles impose that sort of restriction. The wording of Strike means that you can't ready them. I don't know if that was intentional, but it seems unnecessary to me. Stance should explicitly state that you can only be in one at a time. Battle Mastery needs a limit. To give an extreme example, 10 goblins could run past you and you'd somehow get 10 swings in with your great sword. Even just giving two or three reactions would suffice. Search as a bonus action. That's another interesting one. Martial supremacy is way over the top. Most capstone abilities are like ""once per day you can do a thing for a minute"". Unless I'm missing something, all Strength of Stone does is give your proficiency bonus on strength checks if you're trained in athletics. If that's the case, it might as well just say you can add your proficiency bonus. Bounding assault isn't an assault. Its more of a tumble or skirmish. Iron Heart Surge should specify whether or not you get your actions back on the turn you use it. Strike of Perfect Clarity should say resistance, and probably shouldn't be able to overcome immunity. The trigger for Supreme Blade Parry should be ""You would be hit by an attack"". Earthstrike Quake should target a sphere and should only hit creatures that are touching the ground.

I don't think weapon specialization is a good idea for a fighting style. It's basically just a better dueling style with any weapon but you can never change your mind. None of the other styles impose that sort of restriction.   Weapon Specialization is in a weird place. For 1 handed weapons, dueling is better from 1-10, and better at 20. For 2 handed weapons, Great Weapon Style is always better. The reason I included it though is because I really dislike rerolling damage dice as a mechanic, especially when you are rolling 4d6 per attack. It just slows combat down too much.   The wording of Strike means that you can't ready them. I don't know if that was intentional, but it seems unnecessary to me.   Interesting, I hadn't even thought of that. Let me see what I can do.

To give an extreme example, 10 goblins could run past you and you'd somehow get 10 swings in with your great sword. Even just giving two or three reactions would suffice.   I see what you are saying here. I simply don't like the added complexity of having to track how many reactions you have taken for weird corner cases where you get tons of reactions per round. Maybe I could limit it to once per initiative count, so if all 10 goblins acted on initiative 14, you could still only OA one of them.   Search as a bonus action. That's another interesting one.   Thanks, I felt it was fitting for diamond mind.   Martial supremacy is way over the top. Most capstone abilities are like ""once per day you can do a thing for a minute"".   Is it over the top, yes. Is it too powerful? Not in my opinion. It represents roughly a 25% increase in DPR. A fighter going from 3 attacks per round to 4 attacks per round gets a 33% increase in DPR. The barbarian has been able to have advantage on every attack he makes starting from level 2, and their capstone is huge (+4 STR, +4 Con, unlimited rages per day). The warlock gets access to Foresight at level 17 which gives advantage to all rolls and makes all attacks against him suffer disadvantage, and this buff lasts pretty much all day long. Then there is the druid who can shapechange at-will to a 130 HP elemental. Level 20 is supposed to be about crazy over the top abilities.   Unless I'm missing something, all Strength of Stone does is give your proficiency bonus on strength checks if you're trained in athletics. If that's the case, it might as well just say you can add your proficiency bonus.   I had that originally, but there are some instances where using Athletics matters, such as if you have advantage on Athletics checks.   Bounding assault isn't an assault. Its more of a tumble or skirmish.   Originally this was a strike. I may change it back from a boost to a strike.   Iron Heart Surge should specify whether or not you get your actions back on the turn you use it.   Good point, I will clarify.   Strike of Perfect Clarity should say resistance, and probably shouldn't be able to overcome immunity.   I think I am going to rework this maneuver entirely actually.

UnearthedArcana,3b9mtp,DersitePhantom,3,Sat Jun 27 15:52:52 2015 UTC,"I'll start by saying that I love what you've done with this class, and apart from a few minor gripes, I'd probably be willing to let a player in one of my games play this class. With that said, there are a couple of issues:   Mithral Tornado is way too strong to be available at 1st level. It's based on an 11th level Ranger feature, and while I understand that the Ranger can do it at will, it's still up to 9 attacks. I don't think it needs to be changed other than to add a greater prerequisite though. I believe there's a minor miswording in Mountain Fortress Stance. It gives immunity to critical hits when I think you meant ""treat critical hits as normal hits."" I can't imagine you actually meant that you take no damage at all from crits. Girallon Windmill Flesh Rip refers to mainhand and offhand weapons when there is in fact no such distinction in 5e. All characters are essentially presumed to be ambidextrous and can use either hand for any attack. So this needs to be reworded a bit. This is going to be hard to mitigate, but as it stands, Blademaster is overpowered as a single level multiclass dip for any martial character. Gaining a fighting style and the Student of Battle features along with 3 maneuvers, while reasonable for the class itself, is too much to give too easily for a multiclassed character. I'm not sure how this could be resolved. This is a relatively minor issue, but the flavour of the class seems kind of weak at the moment. Like, it's a fighter but also kind of a monk but then cooler? I'd tie it to emulating great warriors of the past, as that fits in with the maneuvers flavourwise. You don't need to make any mechanical changes for this, but I think it would make the class feel better."
UnearthedArcana,3b9mtp,DersitePhantom,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:19:15 2015 UTC,"Good points here. Here are some potential ideas for changes.  Mithril Tornado limits the number of attacks you can make to your proficiency bonus (or has a level 5 prerequisite).  Girallon Windmill Flesh Rip is changed to allow you to take the Attack Action twice, and says if you engage in two weapon fighting, double the number of attacks you make with your bonus action.   For the level dipping, I was thinking to move the regain momentum on a crit or kill to Battle Instinct. That would help minimize the effects of a 1 level dip.   For the flavor, I was imagining something similar to a hybrid of the fighter and monk. A lightly armored mobile warrior who masters exotic martial techniques not available to more mundane warriors. I drew most of the flavor the ToB warblade though, so I could see how it might be somewhat lacking and in need of improvement."
UnearthedArcana,3b9mtp,KefkeWren,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:16:18 2015 UTC,"Mithril Tornado limits the number of attacks you can make to your proficiency bonus (or has a level 5 prerequisite).   Limiting things to a number equal to proficiency bonus isn't really done in 5e. Prof gets added to stuff, but the number itself is rarely referenced. Level 5 prerequisite would, in my view, better fit with 5e design while also sticking more to the original intent.   Girallon Windmill Flesh Rip is changed to allow you to take the Attack Action twice, and says if you engage in two weapon fighting, double the number of attacks you make with your bonus action.   Perfect. No complaints here.   For the level dipping, I was thinking to move the regain momentum on a crit or kill to Battle Instinct. That would help minimize the effects of a 1 level dip.   While this does mitigate the effect significantly, a 2 level dip is still quite powerful (though that is a greater cost). On the other hand, overpowered 2 level dips have more precedent (Warlock.)   For the flavor, I was imagining something similar to a hybrid of the fighter and monk.   I feel that the lack of originality here is a problem (again, a very minor problem). If you ever end up reformatting the whole class and doing a 2.0 release or something, it's something to keep in mind, and I still recommend the ""emulating great warriors of the past"" thing.  Edit: Actually, I've got one more concern: Why are stances a type of maneuver, yet they have their own column in the class table the count as their own feature at level 5? Is it a limitation or a bonus on top of stances you pick up as maneuvers? Do the stances you know count towards the maneuvers you know? What does the ""Martial Stance"" feature actually do, mechanically speaking?"

It's not a big thing, but I think it would be great if there were at least an option for something more useful to blade dancers there. I'm not sure what that would be, but it's one of those things that bugs me, when a class obsoletes its own kit."

It has less AC than those classes too. It lacks the Barbarians d12 HD, the Paladins lay on hands, and the fighters second wind giving it less HP per day than those classes. The barbarian also has resistance to damage while raging, which is every fight by mid levels.  So the class is less tough and less damaging than the other martial warriors. What it gets in exchange for that is mobility and the ability to initiate powerful maneuvers.  I'd gladly tone down some things if I had some examples of what you feel is too powerful though."

I friggin' LOVE what you did with the runes here in the flavor. I've just recently been working on some rune-based stuff for some classes, and this feels right on the money. I could write an entire campaign on this stuff! I almost hope WotC never publish their own Magus stuff just so I can keep this as canon. :D  One thing that feels like a bit of a stumble is a lack of a spellstrike, wherein your spells themselves are channeled through your weapon. I see that you've incorporated it into the elemental strike ability, which seems like a good compromise for trying to keep the rules simple (as is 5e's way), but it winds up feeling more like ""look at this blade trick!"", as opposed to ""the blade is an extension of my body and magic"". even if this doesn't change, though, that's really a minor loss; just speakin' up for it!  Of the three orders, Bladebound feels the most fully-considered, ripe with role playing opportunities and fun stuff! Whereas, say, the lore keeper feels flat by comparison, just a bit less developed.   I'm really happy to see someone giving this a go, though. Thanks for all the work so far!"
UnearthedArcana,3ay102,famoushippopotamus,10,Wed Jun 24 12:23:15 2015 UTC,"Did you have a particular in-game intention for this? I'd love to hear it.  Idea (spitballing): give it to a level-1 fighter, and then have his hometown attacked by literally hundreds of hobgoblins. A real threat, the kind of force that should logically crush any resistance the village can muster, including retired adventurers. With a crazy-ass sword like that, the tide goes in exactly the opposite direction from what the hobgoblin colonel intended. His forces decimated (or worse), he's forced to withdraw in shame.  And that's the start of the campaign: we have the fighter (and his friends) thrust into the spotlight, as everyone thinks he's some sort of battle genius, when in reality he's a slightly special warrior with a good weapon that has only a few bursts of devastation left. Local nobles and politicians will try to use him, local commoners will expect him to engage in a slew of heroics: suddenly, there's a lot of responsibility on his young shoulders.  If the players are big on game balance, I might even have the hero's player use a lower point buy (or use the worst rolls at the table: a +2 weapon will make up a lot of the difference, and having the hero be the least impressive party member would really fit the narrative themes well)  You have one (of several) primary antagonists: a hobgoblin noble who knows who the pc's are and has personal reasons to hate them (but no more army to hunt them with). Other antagonists could be other hobgoblin commanders, or unrelated threats.  The young hero could really be any melee-using class, not just fighter. (Pally, barbarian - even valor bard or bladelock) The other players will need to be okay with a game where one player tends to draw the in-universe spotlight, though not necessarily in the narrative. (ie the bard could make a career out of telling his exploits - narrative spotlight on the bard, but the world is still hung up on the  hero. The rogue will need a good cover story, but can always sneak off to do rogue-y things.)  I'd play in that game."
UnearthedArcana,3ay102,jmartkdr,5,Wed Jun 24 16:03:53 2015 UTC,"A bard with this weapon would be ridiculous.  The one thing you need the carrier to be in your scenario is meek - he needs to know he's more or less a fraud to maximize the hijinks the party has to go through to conceal the fact.  If a bard is carrying it they'd just CHA everyone into believing that they are, in fact, totally awesome and it would seem that that level of ""certainty"" would play against them.  Now, maybe a Bard NPC is carrying it... they've used up almost all of the charges and are starting to freak right the fuck out because he's made a lot of powerful enemies... Desperation driving his every action, he avoids nothing to use his last charges - like a cat on is 9th life - he dreads the revelation of his years of lies.  Maybe he's a patron for the group who hires them to track down more charges or maybe he's the big bad... or, sticking with the theme of all possibilities at once, both!"
UnearthedArcana,3ay102,stokleplinger,3,Wed Jun 24 16:50:00 2015 UTC,Awesome ideas. Keep in mind that the sword only works for 20 rounds. That's it. Finding a new clockwork engine would be an entire campaign in and of itself.

Also, if you want this to work with hordes, it should have some sort of movement, range or teleportation ability.

MORE effects, MORE sway stuff, MORE stance stuff.... @_@  Like honestly I've never met a player who wanted to have to check their sheet 100 times in combat to make sure they didn't fuck up their math lol tone down the things the player (AND DM) have to keep track of. Flavor is there, but you have a lot of completely useless and unnecessary ingredients. Just make it a monk archetype and lose some of the stuff, give it a mechanic like battlemaster where you get to pick maneuvers aka techniques and go from there otherwise this is never gonna be a good option"

UnearthedArcana,3av5q0,ArcieMcLean,5,Tue Jun 23 19:30:40 2015 UTC,"As a more general note, this goes against some of the 5th edition design philosophy. Not that that's objectively bad, just something to think about.  Specifically, 5th edition doesn't have any 'negative' feats or features - nothing, not even Wizard specialization schools, limits or takes away from something; they only give the players more options. In 5th edition, compared to 3.5/Pathfinder, a chosen school only gives a wizard new abilities that relate to his chosen school, instead of limiting his choice of spells.  With that said, from a balance perspective:  There are very few spells that call for ability checks - counterspell is one of those spells that requires a check, and being an Abjurationist Wizard already makes you essentially unbeatable at dispelling. It also needs some clarification. What if you cast Enhance Ability on yourself and make a check using the ability you enhance?  The whole feat requires a lot of book-keeping. Again with the first point - this isn't bad, but it's something that 5th edition tries to avoid. For example, if you take this as a Sorcerer, you'll have your normal list of metamagics you can apply, then you'll have another metamagic ability that you can apply only to a small subset of the spells you know.  For Wizards, your 3rd point doesn't state that the spells get added to a spellbook.  Can you apply the metamagic you learn to only your bonus spells learned? Or any spell you cast from your specialized school?  Finally, as an edge case, this is much much better for the 1/3 caster level classes (Eldritch Knight & Arcane Trickster) - since these classes are inherently limited in their school selection, they can take this feat and get nothing but benefits from it.  On a constructive note, I would honestly recommend stripping this down to the basic idea of what you'd like to accomplish (a school of magic specialization feat) and going from the top back up, approaching this making good use of some of the 5th edition design philosophies. Maybe turn it into picking a school then at each new spell level you get you can learn an additional spell of that level (up to 5th) and can cast it once per day as a special ability."
UnearthedArcana,3av5q0,Eltonbrand,2,Tue Jun 23 20:15:26 2015 UTC,"5th edition doesn't have any 'negative' feats or features   Id say a berserker barb has a negative feature.

UnearthedArcana,3av5q0,Eltonbrand,2,Wed Jun 24 12:18:40 2015 UTC,Good point.  They don't have any negative stats or restrictions other than that one lol
UnearthedArcana,3av5q0,Lord_of_Hydras,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:36:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have been told that 5e is generally anti-negative feat. I just hate how generic wizards became. This would be a much easier feat to balance if I could limit it to wizards, but feats don't seem to have those limitations nor chains anymore, haha. The concept driving this is the 3.5 and older wizard specialization rules. I think if a player wants his character to extra-focus on a school, they should be given an option to do that and the penalties that go along with it.  The ability check is not just in casting. It would include Arcana checks dealing with those specific skills, such as recognizing the nature of a magical trap or device. As I pointed out in another response, I feel it should include determining what someone else is casting.  I have stated that I am struggling to make this feat general enough that it would work with all casters although the actual concept is based on wizard specialization. Any help in this matter would be wonderful! I think the sorcerer fix would be something like:   If you already have metamagic, this feat grants a new metamagic ability of your choice, otherwise you gain a metamagic ability to use on the selected spells and 4 sorcery points.   The other direction would be something like:   The chosen spells can be cast with the chosen metamagic ability once per day without spending sorcery points.   I am honestly not sure which way to go. I also have no idea what to do with the EK and AT.  The previous version of this feat was:  School Specialization:  You have stopped studying one school in order to focus on your chosen school specialization more intensely.  -Int, Wis, or Cha +1  -You get Advantage on any ability check relating to your favored school of magic and disadvantage on your contradictory school.  -You cannot cast Spells higher than 1st level from your school's contradictory school  Transmutation <-> Abjuration Divination <-> Conjuration Evocation <-> Enchantment Necromancy <-> Illusion   -Select up to 3 level 1 spells from the favored school and 1 metamagic ability.  You automatically learn those level 1 spells if you don't know them already Always treat these spells as being prepared, if that is a class requirement. You can perform the metamagic once per short rest choosing one of the spells on that list."
UnearthedArcana,3av5q0,DersitePhantom,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:51:07 2015 UTC,"I imagine by ""Alteration"", you mean transmutation, right?   -Select one spell for each level of spell you can cast and again when you gain a new level of spell, up to level 5 spells.   Does this include cantrips (level 0 spells)? Either way, there should be a restriction that the spells must come from your class's spell list, or you'll wind up with wizards casting healing spells and warlocks using smites.  I feel like this ranges from more harm than good (for wizards, ironically enough) to potentially seriously overpowered (this negates a major problem sorcerers have that factor into their balancing, and the sorcery points are more useful to them with their other abilities.)  Oh, and the ""advantage on related ability checks"" is usually pretty useless, but makes counterspell really powerful if someone picks abjuration.  I like the idea, but there are definitely some bugs to be ironed out."
UnearthedArcana,3av5q0,DersitePhantom,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:56:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, I mean Transmutation, haha. I will fix that, thanks.  I was thinking it would include cantrips unless there is a reason it shouldn't. The intention was to not include cross class, I just lost the wording in the new rendition. I will resolve that issue.  Thinking about it, maybe the specialized spells should just be out of spells you already know. So you pick your spells for the level, then you can choose one of them to be your specialized spell.  I have been racking my brain around how to make this fit for sorcerers. Yeah, getting 4 extra sorcery points is pretty awesome, but the extra metamagic feat might be useless depending on when they get it. Not to mention, they don't have the metamagic limitation... Maybe the original idea is better which allows the application of the effect x-times per day... Thoughts?  Also, it feels like the design idea behind the Arcana skill was to clump all of the magic skill related stuff from 3.5, so I don't know why you wouldn't be able to do an Arcana (Spellcraft) check to see what a wizard is casting in combat. I have seen a lot of discussion on this and it doesn't make sense that this would have been intentionally removed from the game. That and I don't see any ruling stating 100% in any of the books that it couldn't be used this way. In this case, that bonus would be very useful fighting a wizard for something like identifying a fireball and warning the party as a reaction."

Depends on whether you have a problem with Warlocks taking the feat with the sole purpose of quickening Eldritch Blast a couple of times a day.   Thinking about it, maybe the specialized spells should just be out of spells you already know.   If you want this feat to be of roughly equal value for different caster classes, then this is the way to go. Number of spells known is a pretty major balancing factor for a couple of classes.   I have been racking my brain around how to make this fit for sorcerers.   One way to do it would be to call them something like ""Arcane Points"" and have them function exactly the same as sorcery points, but only for the purposes of this feat. That way you get around the unbalanced interaction.   I don't know why you wouldn't be able to do an Arcana (Spellcraft) check to see what a wizard is casting in combat.   If that's you're intent, then you should specify advantage on Arcana checks related to your specialized school. It's less vague and less abusable.  Also, something I just noticed, there's currently no text saying that you ever get the sorcery points back from a long rest."

The idea of Arcane points crossed my mind, but this would add more bookkeeping than I think I want. You have these points, and these points, and don't forget those points, gotta keep track of them all! Maybe get rid of the points and make it once or twice per short rest?  I could specify Arcana checks. That is pretty much the idea I was going for. Thanks!"

It needs a prerequisite that narrows eligibility down to wizards. I recommend the Arcane Tradition class feature.  I feel like the first benefit should just double proficiency bonus for the chosen school and remove it for the counter-school. It paces the feat out a little better, with a minimum of +3 (which is statistically just shy of what advantage translates into) and a maximum of +6 (significantly better than advantage).  The bonus spells known feels like the right thing to do, and I think you landed the text pretty close, though I'd suggest:  ""Select one wizard spell from your chosen school for each spell level for which you have slots. These spells are always treated as being prepared, and do not count against the total number of spells you can prepare in a day.""  The metamagic power... just a tweak too powerful, as is. Too many uses for it to feel 5thy enough... Make it once per short or long rest and it's got a much better feel to it. Then who cares which Metamagic they pick?  Alternatively, since if I'm be honest I don't really like crossing the line into sorcerer stuff, I'd probably make the following the third benefit granted by the feat:  ""When you cast a wizard spell from your chosen school, you can chose not to expend the spell slot.

It simply adds a few modified spells to the wizard. The wizard still can't expend spell slots for higher level spell slots or vice versa. The wizard can't, on the fly, decide to change the damage a few dice one round, twin spell the next round, and take points from dumped level 1 and 2 spells to cast an extra 3rd level spell the following round. The sorcerer design is about spell slot manipulation and spell effect manipulation. What I am trying to create is just a few selected spells which can be cast with an added modification. The versatility is still not nearly as high as a sorcerer's can be and even less so because the feat is causing you to give up potential spells.  The way you worded the bonus spell text doesn't allow for a new spell each time you gain the ability to cast a new level of spell. That's where I was getting hung up on the text.  So you are saying it should have ""Prerequisite: A chosen Arcane Tradition""? I like that because it fixes the level 1 human feat variant issue I was thinking about!  Would the metamagic power be better balanced if it was once or twice per short rest without level scaling? The half level rounded down allows half the uses a sorcerer could max out at if they spent their sorcery points on nothing but metamagic abilities. Another thought is, if I am adding the Arcane Tradition, I could go back to the sorcery point idea, giving 3 or 4 static sorcery points. This would be closer to the Martial Adept design which only grants one superiority die.  The benefit idea you put up is interesting. It would need to be worded differently though. I cast Wish and then decide not to expend my 9th level spell slot so I can cast Wish again. I think it would need the ""up to 5th level spell slot"" amendment. This, I was concerned with, because of the balancing act and not knowing where the line was on spells available per day. One of my earlier ideas just granted a free use of each of the Focused spells per day, but that would end up being one extra spell per day of every level through spell level 5, and I was told that's way broken, haha!"

UnearthedArcana,3apqbx,Mutericator,5,Mon Jun 22 14:34:37 2015 UTC,"Looks great!  I've been trying to make some of the trick weapons myself.  I'd also add a +1/+1 bonus for good measure; you could tinker with bonuses to change the rarity of the weapon.  Maybe add   There's a lot of great parallels between D&D and BB.  You have the brain in the Nightmare of Mensis, for example, which is very reminiscent of a beholder, or A Call Beyond, which is basically Magic Missile.  Here are some of my ideas for more trick weapons, and other items/spells from Bloodborne:  Augur of Ebrietas  3rd level conjuration  Casting Time: 1 action  Range: 15 feet  Components: V, S, M (a slug)  Duration: Instantaneous  You summon tentacles from another dimension to lash out at your foes.  Make a melee spell attack against a target you can see within range.  On a hit, the target takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a miss.  Casting at Higher Levels.  For each spell slot level above 3rd, the damage increases by 1d10.  (Class spell lists: warlock, wizard)  Beast Claws  Magic weapon (special), uncommon (requires attunement by a barbarian)  These simple melee weapons have the Finesse property, a damage die of 1d4 (slashing), count as one item for the purpose of attunement, and have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.  While you are raging, this bonus increases to +3.  Blades of Mercy  Magic weapon (scimitar/daggers), legendary (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)  This magic scimitar has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.  As a bonus action, you can transform it into two daggers, each with a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls (the daggers count as one item for the purposes of attunement).  This weapon deals an additional 7 (2d6) damage to creatures of evil alignment.  If an attack from this weapon causes such a creature to drop to 0 hit points, it dies, and its soul departs to the Upper Planes.  Burial Blade  Magic weapon (scimitar/scythe), legendary (requires attunement)  This magic curved longsword has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls, and has the Finesse property.  As a bonus action, you can combine it with its haft to form a two-handed scythe.  This scythe has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls, the Finesse property, and a damage die of 1d10 (slashing).  When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with the Burial Blade, you lop off the target's head.  The target dies if it can't survive without its head.  A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, has legendary actions, or the DM decides it is too big.  Such a creature takes an extra 4d10 slashing damage from the hit instead.  Cannon  Magic weapon (special), very rare (requires attunement)  To attune to this ranged martial weapon, you must have 20 Strength.  This weapon has the Heavy property and can be equipped on one arm.  As an action, you can fire a cannonball from this gun.  Make a ranged weapon attack against a target within 60 feet, with a magical bonus of +1.  On a hit, the target takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, and it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet and knocked prone.  Chikage  Magic weapon (longsword), very rare (requires attunement)  This magic weapon has a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls.  As a bonus action, you can shift between its one-handed and two-handed forms.  While in its two-handed form, you lose 5 hit points at the beginning of each of your turns, and the weapon deals an additional 2d6 necrotic damage on a hit.  Crow Hunter Mask  Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)  While donning this hunter of hunter's mask, you can't be charmed or frightened, and you have advantage on Wisdom saving throws.  Hunter's Mark  This strange rune has been placed in your mind due to a contract in the waking world.  While it lasts, you can use an action to teleport back to the last place you completed a short rest, losing all experience points you gained in the intermittent time.  Also, when you take damage, you can use your reaction to make a weapon attack against the creature that damaged you if they are within range.  You then regain hit points equal to the damage you deal, but not higher than the damage you took.  Kirkhammer  Magic weapon (longsword/maul), rare  This magic longsword has a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.  Instead of a sheath, it comes with a massive tombstone, carved with a slot for this sword.  As a bonus action, you can slide the sword into the stone, transforming it into a magic maul with a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.  When you hit a target with this weapon, you can force it to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw.  On a failure, the target is knocked prone.  Once you have used this feature, you can't use it again until the next dawn.  Molotov Cocktail  Mundane item  As an action, you can toss this bottle up to 40 feet.  When it lands, each creature within 5 feet must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (2d4) fire damage.  Any objects in that area that aren't being worn or carried catch flame.  Sedative  Potion, uncommon  You can drink this soothing concoction as an action.  For one minute afterwards, you have resistance to psychic damage, and advantage on saving throws against effects that inflict psychic damage.  Third Umbilical Cord (a bit rough)  Wondrous item, legendary  Few of these vestiges of eldritch birth remain.  As an action, you can consume one.  Doing so permanently increases your Intelligence score by 2, as well as your maximum for that score.  You also gain the following traits:   You have vulnerability to psychic damage. You can understand Deep Speech. After consuming 2 umbilical cords, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. After consuming 3 umbilical cords, you can't be charmed, frightened, or dominated by aberrations.   Tonitrus  Magic weapon (mace), rare  This magic mace has a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, and 5 charges.  It regains 1d4 + 1 charges at dawn.  As a bonus action, you can strike the mace against a solid surface, causing it to become charged with electricity.  For the next minute, all of the Tonitrus' attacks deal an additional 7 (2d6) lightning damage."

UnearthedArcana,3app40,Thormundr,2,Mon Jun 22 15:29:45 2015 UTC,"Just for fun, I made a Hulk character. At first I started actually building Hulk. But then I thought about everyone who was putting this class down (both here and in your dndnext post) and I thought about how it could be applied practically.  So, Jeanbert Bassille, the half elven alchemist/wizard's apprentice was trying to create a synthetic, controllable lycanthrope. It was a mild success, but instead of creating a full lycanthrope, his subjects instead became a more bestial, devolved version of themselves.  The captain of the Queen's armies wanted to weaponize the peoject, but Jeanbert and his colleagues did not want their research used for military power. Sadly, they all realized too late that knowledge for the sake of knowledge was deadly and naive. They scattered to the four winds, but not before Jeanbert consumed the last vial himself and destroyed his lab and notes.   Slowly, the Hulks have been hunted down, one by one, the Queensmen trying to get ahold of the formula.  Jeanbert has been meditating, learning to focus the rage monster.  His alter ego, calling itself La Bete, is mostly harmless. He is big... almost 400 pounds and nearly 7 feet tall. And grey skin... almost dark elven. He insists on using a great club in battle. Jeanbert has disposed many, only to wake up and find it replaced.  Where Jeanbert is afraid and almost cowardly, La Bete is noble and brave, albeit chaotic in his methods.  Other ways to use the class:   Battle Mage- Instead of training with he.sword, the.elite.Battle Mages magically tap into their hidden rage and strength.  This almost fits better as the Rage Mage archetype than your Barbarian Path (Which is also cool. I dig the concept). Sort of a backwards play style to a similar concept.  Perhaps their Hulk side is a bound demon or spirit or even abhorrent entity.  There's many ways to use this class without it being ""Marvel's The Incredible Hulk."" Or you can play it that way. Its surprisingly versatile class, and far easier than multiclassing. I like it. I really do and I plan to utilize it in my campaigns.  ETA: 1) Spelling errors... holy geez.  I was on my phone.  I have fat fingers.  And 2) When the Psionics rules get released, I am going to give this thing Psion powers instead of wizard spells and call the class ""Id Beast"" in reference to my favorite 3rd edition power from Malhavoc Press's ""Hyperconscious"" book, *Unleash Id Beast,"" which allowed you to psionically ""Hulk out"" temporarily."
UnearthedArcana,3aml14,Sooky80,2,Sun Jun 21 18:28:51 2015 UTC,"I'm leaning towards: very underpowered, but YMMV as a DM of your own campaign world.  You don't get a choice of domain spells as the Favored Soul does, which is a negative to power level, when comparing the two. The spell list given isn't incredibly exciting, either, unless you're designing the campaign to make those spells very useful or necessary to progress plot.  Furthermore at first level, the bonus proficiencies and knowledge aren't exciting. What you have is cribbed pretty closely from Cleric's Knowledge Domain, but you removed the double-proficiency, which is a major negative to comparative power.  I'm guessing/hoping this is a copy/paste typo, as you didn't give the archetype any power to justify watering it down like that -- as written, this origin is strictly worse than a Knowledge Cleric or any of the Sorcerer origins straight out of the gate.  Read the Stars/Greater Stargazing is great because Divination Wizardry is great. Getting RtS four levels later than the Divination Wizard's equivalent isn't great; this is one of the perils of copying abilities cross-class.  Visions of the Past falls under the same judgement as the spell list: not terrific, unless you the DM are planning on making it a significant plot tool. Even so, Sorcerer progression means you get it later than a Knowledge Cleric, just as RtS comes later; you're not giving this archetype enough quality or quantity other stuff to compensate for those delays.  I'd suggest giving them some ability that interacts with their spellcasting in some capacity; Dragon, Wild, and Favored Soul all get at least one such interaction, which I'd argue is a main Sorcerer feature."
UnearthedArcana,3aml14,madraykin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:39:19 2015 UTC,"These are good points.   I will say that the particular player that will be running this class likes to roleplay, and will likely have a lot of fun with spells such as detect thoughts, speak with dead, and arcane eye. At the same time, however, I don't want to gimp him in combat - which is why I added the Divination school ability (it seems extremely useful, but I may be overestimating it).   I also thought about granting the ability to choose spells from any class (at 1st and/or 6th lvl) and add them to the known-spells list, a-la Bards, but I worried this would be both too powerful and too cumbersome for my player (who isn't super excited about reading the rulebook for descriptions of every spell ever).  Do you think granting the Divination Wizard ability (Read the Stars) at lvl 1 would solve some of these problems? Is it too much to add that ability to bonus spells right out of the gate?"
UnearthedArcana,3aml14,madraykin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:49:53 2015 UTC,"Perhaps allow him to choose from any of the Cleric Domain spell lists, like Favored Soul does. Born under the knowledge star sign, with [domain choice here] ascendant, for fluff justifications and easy selection. Maybe go with Druid of the Land Circle spell choices, if you want to differentiate from FS.  RtS at level one is only one level earlier than Divination Wizard gets it, which is unbalancing but I would argue not excessively or needlessly so. It is a pretty powerful and useful ability straight through to level 20, but level 1 goes by very quickly unless the DM is incredibly tight fisted with XP and makes you languish there for a while. It also fits the mold of ""origin-defining feature"" per your assessment of Sorcerer progression.  You could perhaps nerf it down to only one foretelling roll at lv1 and have the pool increase over levels. That would effectively duplicate Greater Stargazing, however, and would call for a replacement of that feature with something else. It also doesn't jive with how the other Sorcerer Origins progress barring Draconic Resilience's 1hp-a-level bonus; it's your call if that's OK or not."

Focus: I would prefer it give proficiency bonus in damage rather than accuracy. The fighter already gets the potent Archery Fighting style; there is no need for further accuracy increase.  Although I would limit it to once per turn. Or, if you wanna get interesting, Once per round, and extra damage equal to half your level rounded up.   Attacking another creature breaks your focus and if you are hit with an attack you must make a concentration check or lose focus.   I would take the above clause out.

With this you can prone or move a creature away, and it uses existing 5e mechanics to do so, and it gives the fighter a competitive option for its bonus action alongside Focus.  No-Look Attack: More gimmicky than not. Why would you not be attacking the creature you're focusing on? And how does it synergize with Distracting Strike? Distracting Strike necessarily breaks focus.  For a capstone... What about Threatening Reach? E.g. Creatures that move within your ranged weapon's normal range trigger opportunity attacks from you."
UnearthedArcana,3akzvw,Leuku,2,Sun Jun 21 08:24:09 2015 UTC,"I would prefer it give proficiency bonus in damage rather than accuracy. The fighter already gets the potent Archery Fighting style; there is no need for further accuracy increase. Although I would limit it to once per turn. Or, if you wanna get interesting, Once per round, and extra damage equal to half your level rounded up.   So this feature is very much based on the barbarian's rage. It emulates an archer taking a breath and ignoring all other distractions to focus on a single target. This is something that is mentally draining and can only be done a few times per rest, hence why I feel that it is balanced against the increased accuracy. Of course if your party is one that gets a lot of rests it may become OP.  The chance to break focus is again to nerf it slightly as well as encourage the player to position themselves well so they are not an easy target.   Hmm... difficult to think of the full ramifications of such a niche feature. Anyways, reword to: empty a handheld container in a space adjacent to you. You must have at least one hand free to do so.   Perfect thanks.   Hmm. Howzabout instead pulling something from my Bowmaster class?

With this you can prone or move a creature away, and it uses existing 5e mechanics to do so, and it gives the fighter a competitive option for its bonus action alongside Focus.   I'm not sure about other people but to me this doesn't fit well with the flavour of an archer, especially when people are more likely to be scoring high in DEX rather than STR. Heck I imagine for most builds STR would be used as a dump stat.   More gimmicky than not. Why would you not be attacking the creature you're focusing on? And how does it synergize with Distracting Strike? Distracting Strike necessarily breaks focus.   Definitely gimmicky, situations I have imagined where you would attack a different creature:   Someone is getting to close to you or another ranged character (wizards) Able to use distracting Strike without breaking focus ( I need to word both features more clearly) Shooting at any enemy mage to break their concentration Shooting down a chandelier on top of your foes (and other situational stuff)    For a capstone... What about Threatening Reach? E.g. Creatures that move within your ranged weapon's normal range trigger opportunity attacks from you.   I do like this and would also like other people's opinions on using this as the capstone feature. It's quite similar to the shadow monk's capstone so fits in well.  Thanks for all your feedback!"
UnearthedArcana,3akzvw,Leuku,2,Sun Jun 21 13:53:36 2015 UTC,"Hmm, OK. I can't think of any strict reason to contradict Focus as it stands, so it'll stand. I suppose the greatest thing I could argue is that Focus' interaction with this subclass' later features seem to increasingly make the use of Focus cluttered.   I'm not sure about other people but to me this doesn't fit well with the flavour of an archer, especially when people are more likely to be scoring high in DEX rather than STR. Heck I imagine for most builds STR would be used as a dump stat.   In my original version for Bowjudo, I had the Shove be made via an intelligence saving throw vs the Bowmaster's save DC rather than an Athletics check.  You could throw in a clause that says the opponent must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw against a save DC determined by your Dexterity.  No Look Shot: Well, since I can't think of anything else, go ahead with it."
UnearthedArcana,3akzvw,robklg159,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:39:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how you mean clutterd? To me it's fairly simple, if you do something that distracts you from the creature you are targeting you lose the focus and the bonus attached. Much like how if a barbarian goes a round without attacking something or a caster casts a new spell that requires concentration."
UnearthedArcana,3afgya,ReillocSW,4,Fri Jun 19 18:26:48 2015 UTC,"I have two points of... curiosity, not opposed to them as is just wondering about the balance of them. You probably have put considerably more thought into them than I have having just read them.   Righteous Interruption: Is this intended to scale with high damage numbers to be difficult or impossible to break? I don't know the upper limits for Paladins, but I imagine it might not be that difficult to hit for 20+ consistently with the right weapon, especially with magic items. The third effect in Righteous Paragon should be a choice whether to use it or not, as its currently worded I don't think you have a choice. Considering it is one time use per long rest I think it should be a choice. The main question is though: is the creature intended to have to make further saving throws against the effect with an intelligence of 1? Against a level 20 Paladin this is impossible without some kind of special effect. -5 to roll, Paladin has 8 + 6 + (5) = 19 DC and the best roll possible against it is a 15 with a natural 20. If a monster has a proficiency bonus to the roll of 5 or more they can just barely succeed.   Other than my uncertainty about those two I love it."
UnearthedArcana,3afgya,Bluegobln,4,Fri Jun 19 20:15:33 2015 UTC,"Righteous Interruption is limited to a single use between rests. It's pretty strong, but not unbearable for the DM given that strict limitation. It'll let a paladin totally stop one spell, but subsequent spells won't be hindered by it.  As for Righteous Paragon, you're totally right. That save becomes pretty much impossible if failed the first time. I hadn't even noticed that when checking it out initially. It should probably be Wisdom or Constitution, depending on the flavor of the feature. The ""on crit"" portion of the ability isn't a single-use thing, though. The feature is the ""buff"" and the on-crit ability is attached to that ""buff"". The ""buff"" is able to be used once per long rest. If you crit back-to-back on two different creatures, they'd both be subject to the effect."
UnearthedArcana,3afgya,Slashlight,2,Fri Jun 19 20:33:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes sense. Maybe it needs to be clarified better, or maybe I just needed to read it better lol... probably its fine."
UnearthedArcana,3afgya,Bluegobln,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:47:15 2015 UTC,"The effects of the ""on crit"" effect, including the Int save are exactly the same as the level 8 Feeblemind spell except that this allows a new saving throw after 1 day and Feeblemind only allows a save after a week.  You are correct, if you fail the initial saving throw you are essentially hosed as far as recovery without some sort of magical intervention, either one of the spells that outright removes the effect, or some sort of buff that raises your INT high enough to have a chance at succeeding on the save."
UnearthedArcana,3afgya,Bluegobln,3,Fri Jun 19 21:16:20 2015 UTC,"On the other hand its a level 20 effect and only lasts 1 minute, and requires a crit during that time...  Maybe if it wore off automatically in increments each time, the target gaining 1-2 int each failure (that makes it a much more complicated effect and its already got a lot of wording though).  And actually the more I look at it the more hilarious I think it is that the effect is so strong. I almost prefer it this way. When you shut someone down you SHUT THEM DOWN!"
UnearthedArcana,3afgya,Slashlight,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:28:47 2015 UTC,"Yea it requires a lot to go right for it to actually be used. You have to activate the buff, score a crit on a weapon attack AND they still have to have to fail their saving throw.  It's really kind of fiddly, so I think it's probably okay that it is so powerful.  And it's totally in flavor that you should reduce your opponent to a drooling vegetable."
UnearthedArcana,3afgya,Leuku,8,Fri Jun 19 21:47:35 2015 UTC,"I like this one a lot. The flavor is perfect for a paladin. It's ripe with zealous arrogance, classic paladin. There's obvious power here, but it mostly falls into a narrow niche of locking down casters. Stunning Smite and Mute Opposition gives it just enough versatility that I wouldn't feel completely gimped for taking this and not running into many casters. A gnome with this Oath is especially tricky for casters to take down, given the gnome's Advantage with Int/Wis/Cha saves.  10/10, would allow in my games."

UnearthedArcana,3ag2q4,Venaty,2,Sat Jun 20 00:13:06 2015 UTC,"I currently have Defensive Duelist on a monk and its quite powerful, but requires a finesse weapon. This type of monk would not typically wield a weapon at all, or if they do they would have only +1 AC. The reaction is just sort of a balance thing where you have to answer the question of: should this be something a monk can always do, blocking with their hands? The way AC works dictates that it clearly isn't always successful. Even at 22 AC there are many enemies which have a decent chance of hitting, and keep in mind we're talking about two stats being capped at 20, something that, barring insane rolled stats, you're only going to accomplish by maybe level 12 or 16 upon reaching your 3rd or 4th ability score improvement and never taking feats.  What do level 12+ characters usually have for AC? and level 16+?  Its still something to consider. I think the reaction is reasonable, but I don't think a flat increase is necessarily overpowered either."

But then the same is true if you had like a ""Belt of Ninja Dexterity"" giving 29 Dex... yikes! I guess that is why Strength is NOT a value used for AC increases ever."
UnearthedArcana,3ag2q4,Leuku,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:30:47 2015 UTC,"In general, there is far too much of combat focus for this subclass. All of the other monk subclasses have access to features that can be utilized out of as well as in combat. But not a single feature here is related to out-of-combat use.  Iron First Technique: Something 5e tries to avoid is incremental modifiers, especially ones that you have to keep track of. The less math you have to do, the better, even if it's simple arithmetic.   Additionally, this is rather a bland feature. A monk's 3rd level is meant to define the monk's path and playstyle for the rest of its career, separating it from other monk subclasses. All this feature does is tell a monk to try and attack as often as possible in a round. A monk is usually going to do that anyways.  Iron-Palm: Monks aren't allowed to use shields alongside Unarmored Defense for a reason: Because Unarmored Defense uses the Monk's primary attack stat for its AC calculation. In contrast, a Barbarian is allowed to use a shield with its Unarmored Defense because a Barbarian's primary attack is Strength, not Dexterity nor Constitution.  You're breaking this limitation on the Monk by giving it such easily accessible bonus AC.   How about instead: As a reaction to a weapon attack made against you, you can gain resistance to it. You may make your reaction after you see the results of the attack roll, but only before you see the results of its damage.  Ki Wave: Wait... so every unarmed strike you make forever affects creatures in a 15 foot line? With no resource cost? And they take damage from your ki wave if they succeed their saving throw rather than failing it? And it deals more damage than your standard unarmed strike!?  WTH?  I'd recommend making it cost 1 Ki point, no additional damage, it deals force damage rather than bludgeoning, and is not considered for the purposes of Iron Fist Technique.   Perfect Defense: Dafuq? Immunity!? Make it Resistance.  And being able to gain on-demand resistance to all non-magical weapon damage is potent enough. There is no need for increasing the number of attacks the monk can make. The monk can already make plenty of attacks.  All in all, this subclass is rather lackluster. All mechanical, no fluff. I recommend trying to figure out a broader picture for a practitioner of the Iron Fist Arts. I believe Tigress from Kung Fu Panda is one such practitioner."

It doesn’t make sense to me. I don’t like having to choose between the idea that languages are inborn, or that every child is raised by both parents.  Adventurers have notoriously complicated and often tragic histories.  A half-troll PC could quite possibly be raised never having met or even seen a troll.  In that case automatically being able to speak Giant is silly.  So In such cases i’ve given a free language so the player can choose to know the language of the exotic parent, or not."

UnearthedArcana,3a9c8g,Bluegobln,2,Thu Jun 18 06:52:43 2015 UTC,"As a reaction if you have a free hand you may draw and/or make a ranged attack with a pistol. (Two handed weapons do not require two hands to hold except when attacking or readying an attack with one.)   Reactions require a trigger.   Critical hits and killing blows each grant you 1 Grit. You may spend 1 Grit to gain Advantage on your next ranged attack with a firearm, on a Dexterity saving throw, or on a Dexterity (Acrobatics) skill check. After a long rest you have 1 Grit regardless of your previous total.   Looks like it'd be easily abused by Champion fighters.   Perhaps change it to natural 20s rather than crits?  Unless you want to particularly boost champions.   as a free action    ""Free actions"" are not officially a term in 5e. Btw, what kind of action does loading a gun normally require?   you may make one ranged weapon attack with a firearm as a bonus action.   What about the loading property?"
UnearthedArcana,3a9c8g,Leuku,3,Thu Jun 18 07:35:12 2015 UTC,"Good points. The reaction should be to an attack or spell cast against the character, of course. The idea being a quick draw artist.  Critical hits are a big point for several classes. Killing blows are also a major thing for several classes. Firearms make a lot of noise so silence spells are a major thing for several classes. Dexterity is a thing for firearms, and so meshes with several classes on that alone. I wanted this to work with most classes in some useful way, maybe better for some than others but useful all the same. Otherwise... just use a Gunslinger class homebrew instead, right? I can't think of all the possibilities, making them possible is the only goal.  Loading as a property automatically reloads a weapon as part of the attack action but limits you to 1 use of the weapon per turn. Reload as a property (firearms specific) requires an action or bonus action. A ""free action"" may not be an actual term, but an action taken for free is an actual thing. I can remove the words free action. ""On your turn, spend 1 Grit to reload a single firearm which has the Reload property."""
UnearthedArcana,3a9c8g,jmartkdr,3,Thu Jun 18 07:56:41 2015 UTC,"I'd leave the crit thing as-is. It does make champion a powerful option, but I don't thin it makes it game-breakingly powerful.  I think the bigger issue here is that how good these feats are depends on how good the firearms are. Were you planning on using the DMG firearm stats?"
UnearthedArcana,3a9c8g,flatlander00321,3,Thu Jun 18 14:32:28 2015 UTC,"Aye!  And yes the firearms as is in the DMG. Modern are pretty powerful yes, but they're supposed to be more powerful than other weapons on some level, balanced more by their rarity and expensive ammunition (depending on your game neither of these may be a factor, but thats entirely up to the DMs). The Future weapons are ridiculous of course but anyone including those in their game will know it beforehand. Maybe I shouldn't have put anything about crafting ammunition in there and left it entirely to DM choice, like I did with gunpowder being completely unmentioned."

Mimicry should give its bonus to Deception rather than Persuasion, as mimicry is a form of Deceit.  Quick Wings: It's not too spectacularly, the ability to dash as a bonus action once per short rest. A 2 level dip in rogue gives you that ability at-will. Let's pump it up, but only slightly!  How about a number of times per short rest equal to your Constitution Modifier, minimum 1? Same as before, except those who put some investment in con get a little more mileage out of it. This subrace has no natural bonus to con, so most users of this subrace will be content with just the one, but any experimental Mocking Birdbarians may find a more potent use for a con-based movement boost.  City Birdfolk: Inspired!  Longneck Bird: Still feels a bit weak. Perhaps increase the base movement to 35 feet. You're already dropping it's base flight speed by 10 feet.

A few people have brought up how lackluster they are comparatively, but I don't know if I want to add more base speed, increase the flight a bit, or give them a dash.

UnearthedArcana,3a5xl6,DoctorGlorious,5,Wed Jun 17 14:10:05 2015 UTC,"It is tricky to judge races that have multiple significant disadvantages, but I'm pretty confident they are overpowered, and that's without the scythe arms actually doing much.  It just says they do slashing damage.  Taking that at face value it would be the unarmed strike of 1HP+mod that everyone else can do-- only slashing instead of bludgeoning.  But I assume you actually mean for them to do 1d6 slashing or something.  This would make them by my reckoning aproximately a 9 ASI point race, where the PHB races average about 6 points (+/- 1 ~ASI).  Maybe I'd rate them lower with more consideration all those pros and cons aren't easy to break down-- and the problem with lots of downsides in a race is that if you figure out a build or playstyle that avoids or minimizes all the downsides they it's just all gravy.  For instance if you build a Mantis Monk.  No armor is no problem, and the scythes might be a big boon depending on what you actually mean for them to do.  And while the hit points are low-- you can probably fly away if you get in a tight spot.  The monk's speed makes up for their -5ft movement, and might even be applied to the fly speed  Some of the disadvantges aren't really significant.  Inability to wear heavy armor isn't much of a negative is a race that's not stated to be a good heavy armor fighter, and when they can't fly in it.  Similarly ecdysis is a significant downside-- except that it has 1day regeneration of limbs built in-- which may be a huge advantage depending on the rules for dismemberment.  And some of the advantages you are given them really don't seem strongly ""mantis themed"" to me.  Darkvision?  Torpor?  Yes insects, and any lower life don't sleep like we do, but that has more with our giant human brains which need a lot of down-time to keep in working order than the fact we are mammals."
UnearthedArcana,3a5xl6,jwbjerk,3,Wed Jun 17 15:13:40 2015 UTC,"Well initially the plan was for them to do 1d4 slashing but I instead to change the damage type of unarmed attacks for the theme and potential damage diversity since only the unarmed attacks made specifically with the scythes would use slashing. With that in mind I would allow a Mantid player to be more likely to succeed at, say, cutting a rope.  The disadvantage of the hp/level really isnt something you can just turn your nose up at. It effectively reduces your constitution modifier by 1. It's no small thing and I think justifies some of their 'more' strengths. The flying is the only thing I would warn prospective DM's about, and even then it is highly restrictive in that it must be used imaginatively to achieve results compared to, say, Aarakocra.  Darkvision is because they are Fey creatures. Torpor is just a re-flavoured version of the Elven Trance feature.  Thank you for the feedback. I will definitely refer to your assessment should I run into difficulties while playtesting."

It is a significant disadvantage-- but not horrible.  And my point is that using big disadvantages to justify additional advantages is problematic when those disadvantages can be circumvented or minimized.  Plenty of classes and builds won't put a big investment into constitution (though it is nice for everyone) so hitpoints aren't a huge priority for all builds and playstyles.   The flying is the only thing I would warn prospective DM's about, and even then it is highly restrictive in that it must be used imaginatively to achieve results compared to, say, Aarakocra.   I certainly agree your flying is far less abusable than the Aarakocra's  But that bird isn't considered a paragon of balance-- and it pays dearly for its flight with an almost complete lack of other traits (just attribute bonuses and the modest talons)."
UnearthedArcana,3a5xl6,Karkaas,3,Wed Jun 17 19:12:13 2015 UTC,Well my hit to the hit points is just so - everyone likes a bit of hp so the disadvantage is never irrelevant is my point. But on the other hand I see where you are coming from - if they are oppressive as a race I will tweak them and release a version 3.  God I have played with only one Aarakocra and man do I regret allowing that race. My flight is gimped for the very reason that it lets me inject more to make the race less of a HEY I HAVE THE FLY SPELL FREE AT LEVEL 1.  Thanks again for your input! Glad to know there's still things to look at if I get the chance.
UnearthedArcana,3a5xl6,sonnyjaboy,2,Thu Jun 18 02:31:05 2015 UTC,"Quick question: It says under chitinous exoskeleton that their AC is 12. Does Dex still apply to this? As in, would their unarmored AC be 12 + Dex? Or is it only 12?"
UnearthedArcana,3a5xl6,Aghastated,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:53:00 2015 UTC,"natural armour applies dex but it only applies dex.

UnearthedArcana,3a5msy,Artisan_Mechanicum,3,Wed Jun 17 12:29:52 2015 UTC,"Brutal Tactics: I would argue that the Superiority Die function far pales in comparison to the fact that you virtually double the number of Rages you can perform per day for the rest of your career, assuming you put sufficient lip service to increasing your Charisma over time.  1 maneuver is just icing on the cake that is Additional Rages. Barbarians are at the top of their game while raging, and there are few others who can match a Barbarian on rage. E.g. Druid's Wildshape. Hence why both are heavily restricted by class level, not overall level nor ability score modifier.  As rough as it is to say the following: I feel it is an incredible flaw in design to so dramatically fundamentally change the Barbarian's primary defining mechanic. The Swashbuckler Rogue changes the Rogue's sneak attack in a fundamental way, but the change is very minor compared to virtually doubling the number of rages a Barbarian can perform. It would kinda be like letting the Rogue sneak attack twice per turn, although I think even that would be stronger than doubling the number of rages.  If I were this Warmaster Barbarian, I would barely pay any attention to the maneuvers and have much greater focus on the additional rages I can perform. Especially considering this feature:    At the beginning of your turn, if you have no superiority dice, your rage ends.   Hell, I wouldn't give up my rage for a single-use maneuver. I would just take the Martial Adept feat so that I can rage AND maneuver. In fact, taking the martial adept feat would even be a feat tax for this subclass, due to you losing your rage when you run out of maneuver dice. Always keep the Martial Adept maneuver die in reserve, while spending your rage maneuver dice. Never run out of rage due to maneuver dice ever!  The 10th level feature seems to diverge from the WOTC's stated purpose of a Barbarian's 10th level, that it be primarily an Interaction Pillar feature rather than a combat focused one.   or you can pick a new target within the range of the weapon for them to attack.   Replace ""or"" with ""otherwise"".  One important general point about homebrewing: Can you achieve the same effect through official means?  Martial Adept feat and Inspiring Leader feat.  That there would be a Warmaster Barbarian right there.  Recall the other DnD user who managed to virtually recreate a Witcher character through official means as a Bladelock, no homebrewing necessary.  That having been said, all the other features are relatively fine, if a bit too combat-centric."
UnearthedArcana,3a5msy,Leuku,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:52:57 2015 UTC,Would it balance out the additional rages if the rage damage bonus or the damage resistance was either reduced or removed? (Like a controlled rage) Or would that deviate too much from the class?
UnearthedArcana,3a5msy,Leuku,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:35:46 2015 UTC,"Deviate. It'd be like going, ""I'm going to make sneak attack work twice per turn, but to offset that power I'm going to force the rogue to only be Allowed to use daggers for sneak attack"".  And the barbarian's rage damage bonus becomes more potent the more attacks a barbarian has. This warmaster subclass doesn't offer any additional means to attack more often, so taking away the damage bonus isn't as big a deal."

UnearthedArcana,3a5msy,Leuku,2,Wed Jun 17 17:18:30 2015 UTC,"Ok, I took a look at frightening presence.  It can be used in combat, but it can also be used entirely out of combat. It has no combat triggers, and frightened is a condition that functions in and out of combat.  Your current 10th feature only triggers off of combat.

UnearthedArcana,3a49z7,CypherSeven,3,Wed Jun 17 02:54:19 2015 UTC,"On an initial pass by, this is a very earnest attempt to make a Psion class. On a more in depth analysis:  Extra Sensory Perception seems fiddly. If it has a limited number of uses, why have the PP cost? It also says you can spend any number of PP on the ability, but there is no incentive to spend more than 1, so either it is missing an augment specific to the feature, it needs to just have a minimum PP cost, just have a limited number of uses without PP being a factor, or have a limited number of uses and can be augmented by spending PP. Also, I'm not sure what kind of feature ESP falls under. Is this a native Power, Talent, or separate feature?  Reading the Augments section, I instinctively want to say the Psion should choose a number of augments instead of just getting access to all they meet the prerequisites for-- Augments seem like the Psionic equivalent to Metamagic for sorcerer and I can holistically see how the design here is aspiring to be a fusion of Wizard, Sorcerer, and maybe just a bit of Warlock elements to create something new, so dialing it back to maybe 1 Augment at 1st level and then gain more at levels 3, 7, 11, and 15 might be more in line with 5e design as a whole. You might also consider something where they aren't stuck with their choices later on, like at level 5 they can exhange one known augment for another every long rest and then an additional one at 9, 13, and 17. Finally ending with the capstone opening up all Augments. Furthermore, Augments having their uses scale off of proficiency is problematic for multiclassing characters since Proficiency scales off Character level and not class level. Consider attaching PP costs to the Augments instead.  As for the Augments themselves, the follow seem to fall in line with the description of ""Psions gain the ability to augment their powers with the flexibility of their mind."":   Limit Removal - Heighten Spell equivalent, so all good there. Calm Mind - Cool, but breaks a core 5e rule and that makes it a no go for homebrew. consider instead allowing them to maintain two concentration powers at the same time, but only one can be active at a time and they can dictate which is active with a bonus action or a reaction. Thought Conduit - Interesting. Only applies to a single power though.   The other augments seem more suited to being Powers, Talents, or just straight up features of Disciplines since they do not improve an existing power already, but simply produce an effect on their own. Also, some have PP cost while others do not, yet they all have limited uses intended-- supporting just PP costs might be the better way to go.  Psionic Control and Signature Power both seem like stronger versions of the Wizard's Spell Mastery and Signature Spells. A 1st & 2nd level spell that can be cast freely is lesser than a 3rd level ""spell"" that  can be manifested freely. Likewise being able to get a  single free manifestation of a 6th level ""spell"" is much better than two 3rd levels can be cast a single time for free each. If you're set on having an ability like this with those levels, consider instead simply lowering the PP cost of the selected Powers. Though I think there could be a much more compelling capstone for this class than borrowing from the Wizard.  Metacreaitivity is interesting for the fact that at level 2 you get an augment that is wholly necessary to even tap into the 2nd level feature. It might due to simply have the Energy Crystal be the level 2 feature, then the Astral Construct as the 6th with notes about it being able to be improved with PP useage at later levels, leaving World Shaper for for 10th level and a new kind of feature for 14th.  With Pyrokinesis, Flare and Wild Fire both seem like they could work well with any Power that deals fire damage-- in fact these might be better as augments if changes to just apply toward fire powers and a more template damage modification instead of straight die improvement for Flare. Just say no to breaking immunity and resistance with Nova Heat. Maybe allow Fire damage to converted into half fire and half radiant. Everything else about it is fine. Eternal Heat is a fun concept, but currently broken. Guaranteed kills against targets not immune to fire (which the current design ignore) as long as they fail the save initially. Additional saves each round can make this more appropriate.  I'd look more into this, but I need to work on an upcoming game tomorrow. I think this has real potential though-- the rough draft has a solid framework. With some rearrangement and tweaks it could be the gold standard for homebrew psionics."
UnearthedArcana,3a49z7,Mazjerai,2,Fri Jun 19 04:57:28 2015 UTC,Here's a Psion class. I couldn't make augments like metamagic since we already have that.   I did it the opposite where the archetype focuses mainly on one thing making it better. Compared to giving you a broad array of abilities around a single concept. I know of a couple things I'm going to change like Telepathy. Should I keep it the way it is or totally restructure the style of abilities.  Some people thought you should have a tier list for powers.  I don't know man. I'm just really tired. Tell me what to do I don't want to think anymore.

By charging at a foe, they can pierce through them dealing 1d6 piercing damage.   What's that mean?  ""Charge"" isn't a thing in 5e.  Is it supposed to be a weapon you can use whenever you want, or only after a certain kind of action?   Due to your hide, you have a natural armor bonus of +3. When unarmored, your AC is equal to 10 + your natural armor bonus + your Dexterity ability modifier.   This isn't quite clear.  The first sentance makes it sound like you have a flat bonus-- armored or not.  If that's not your intention, remove the +3 from the first sentance, and make it entirely fluff.  Looking at the abilities individually I'd say it is overpowered, but it might be merely at the top rank, instead of above it, since there isn't synergy between everything.  Natural Armor (if we go by the second sentence) is only useful if you aren't taking advantage of the Heavy armor proficiency.  I will say the Eland is notably weaker than the Syncerus.  In spite of the Musicus scale, knowing abyssal is generally less useful than a nature proficiency.  Similarly a +1 to INT is only very useful for once class and a couple archetypes, while a CON bonus is valuable for all builds."

UnearthedArcana,3a1sob,Slashlight,3,Wed Jun 17 02:11:01 2015 UTC,"One quick question: what do you want this class to do?   The mind blade and some of the features suggest a striker (d10 hp, extra attack, fighting style, half casting) while others suggest a controller (spell choices, huge int buff capstone, telepathy, both subclasses.)   Some of your abilities are incomplete, like Psychic Hardening and Mind Reader (at least I hope Mind Reader isn't ""detect thoughts as a cantrip at 3rd level, with bonuses."")  I'd suggest looking at the bard for inspiration (pun intended.) Full casters can have good melee too."

Their primary, and more consistent, damage source being their mind blade attacks while offering some psychically themed utility and control spells to up their arsenal. Is the combination of both too strong?"
UnearthedArcana,3a1sob,AngryKoboldDm,3,Wed Jun 17 02:15:55 2015 UTC,"While I like the class, this doesn't really capture the feeling of ""Psion"", which is an established class/archetype. A Psion is a full caster that can specialize in many of the same things that a Wizard can. If memory serves, there's really just one school that Psions can't mimic, which is Necromancy.  As for the class itself, some stuff is overpowered, other stuff seems pretty weak. Psychic Hardening, for example, is weak and unfinished. Unarmored Defense, a similar feature, scales with its stat to provide up to a +5 bonus to AC as opposed to a flat +3. If Psychic Hardening is supposed to provide some other benefit, such as Resistance to certain damage types, it might help close the gap a bit.  Mental Reflex is completely overpowered. You've handed the class a buffed up version of the Shield spell that doesn't use a spell slot. You get up to +5 to your AC (and who wouldn't max out the only stat that matters to the class?) and get to deal guaranteed damage without using up a single resource. The only downside is that sometimes you won't get that AC bonus. Considering that the class gets access to Shield anyway, I'm not certain why this feature needs to exist in its current form.  I dislike Overwhelming Force. It's another step between me and dealing damage. I have to cast a spell/use Mental Reflex and wait for it to resolve. Then I have to wait for a contest to resolve, then I get to deal damage. Consider treating it like Great Weapon Fighting and allow me to re-roll low dice when dealing psychic damage. That feels better than a contest.  As for the two subclass archetypes, Dancing Blade is underwhelming. You don't really gain any benefits in this path. Your level 3 ability is strictly worse than the Beast Master Ranger's feature. Your weapon is eating up your Action each turn or it's doing... absolutely nothing. It doesn't have a reaction of its own and the other benefit, flanking, only works if your game is using that variant rule. This feature literally does nothing for you or your party. The Overcharged Dancing Blade is similarly bad. Sacrificing a precious spell slot to gain up to a +4 damage bonus on Dancing Blade is weak at best. That spell is worth far, far more than a few points of damage. A Paladin gets to deal a 2d8 damage from a first level spell, up to 5d8 damage from a 5th level spell, and can never miss. Dancing Blade, even with Overcharged, sacrifices a spell to do far less damage and it has a chance to miss. The tradeoff simply isn't worth it. The only feature I like from the Dancing Blade archetype is Telekinetic Enhancement.  As for Mind Bender, this is laughably overpowered. Induced Psychosis simply adds a bunch of damage to control spells and can't break many of those spells. Mind Blast is a solid feature, but I'm not sure why it needs to interact with Induced Psychosis. Duality of the Mind flat out should not exist as it's way, way too strong a feature. Mind Fulmination is also pretty good, but doesn't really feel like it belongs on a primarily melee class.  Overall, I think that this is a good starting point, but I wouldn't consider it finished. You need a new name, Dancing Blade needs an overhaul, and Mind Bender needs to be reined in."

UnearthedArcana,3a1sob,darude11,2,Wed Jun 17 02:24:11 2015 UTC,"Any time. I like the class' identity, it just needs refinement. Focus on what the class is supposed to be mechanically and spread out from there. If it's supposed to be a psychic warrior, consider emulating the paladin. The paladin's spells enhance its own combat prowess rather than lock down the field and it's smite ability allows it to trade some buffs for a big burst in damage. Similarly, the 3.5 psychic warrior didn't use a bunch of control powers or damage powers, but he used stuff that made him into a nigh unstoppable beast. Focus on that stuff and leave the battlefield control to the squishier classes."

UnearthedArcana,39ssa0,shiginoth,5,Sun Jun 14 13:32:43 2015 UTC,"Basically all the abilities apart from the shadowy messanger had a combat component. Having things like blur at 3rd level along with the other rogue abilities proved pretty powerful. This way you still get a easy sneak attack, and used in conjunction with shadow strike at higher levels makes for a easy Shadow minion or 2. Plus, at least with my group short rests are pretty common."
UnearthedArcana,39ssa0,Pixie1001,4,Sun Jun 14 13:45:21 2015 UTC,"One thing I noticed right off the bat is that thus class at third level is technically a better spell caster than a warlock of the same level.  Admittedly their spell list kinda sucks, but I would really reduce that feature to be either regenerated after a long rest instead of a short one or only once per short rest, with the same progression.  Shadow strike looks like it could maybe be abused, but I haven't looked up the stat block in the monster manual yet so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.  I'm not sure if 60 feet is a little to far for an at-will teleport as well, I'd personally cut it back to 30 since the fact that you can teleport up walls and avoid suffering attacks of opportunity is strong enough as it is.  The 9th and 13th level features would normally be reversed as well following the general theme of Rogue Archetypes, but I can understand why you'd want to push shadow stepping to an earlier position, so it probably not anything to worry about.  Otherwise, it looks pretty good."

At 3rd level they are equal at best to a warlock at 3rd level, warlock will have 2 2nd level spell slots no matter what, here only if int is at 18 or higher, not likely. Shadow strike can at most create 2 Shadows (CR1/2) at level 17. A wizard at level 11 can cast create undead wh8ch creates a ghoul (CR 1) 2 if a necromancer if I'm correct. As for Shadow step, this is given as is at 6th level to a monk, 9th here and cloak of shadows at 11th to the monk 13th here."
UnearthedArcana,39ssa0,vaegrim,3,Sun Jun 14 14:46:31 2015 UTC,"Ah, I missed the 'half your intelligence modifier' bit for Shadow Strike - with that included I'd say the ability is safely within balance.  However, the shadow thief would only need an Int score of 16 to be stronger casters than Warlocks - who are full casters. And at higher levels they'd be able to cast these spells a ludicrous number of times to the point of them pretty much being at-will.  Technically, the Warlock isn't quite a full caster so this isn't terribly OP, but I still think a quarter caster like this shouldn't come so close. They hardly seem like they'd need this many uses anyway.  But maybe their limited utility makes up for it - I guess you'd really have to play test it to be sure. That's just my 10 cents.

UnearthedArcana,39rtbw,DoctorGlorious,3,Sun Jun 14 03:22:48 2015 UTC,"I'll probably go through this later along with musicus's homebrew guide for balance, but the first things that pop out at me is that Wizard's will be stupidly overpowered because they're always wearing Full Plate and thus don't have to invest anything into dexterity. Mage Armour would also be insanely broken.  Just give them a natural Armour rating of 12 or something - if they get caught without their gear, they have an advantage, but classes without armour proficients still lose out. By specifying that its natural armour, it also means that it won't stack with spells like mage armour.  The other one was that you should probably add rules about flying whilst wearing a backpack or in confined spaces - how big are the wings? Check the Elemental Evil Player supplement for an example.  Otherwise, I really like the theme, and the formatting is godly .  You should maybe also note that subraces work more like paragon classes in the pdf.

And hm, with the subraces thing I believe I did specify in the little subrace section ""if your DM allows you to"" but uh... I should probably make that a little more obvious.  Thanks again, your feedback is greatly appreciated"
UnearthedArcana,39rtbw,Leuku,3,Sun Jun 14 05:10:39 2015 UTC,"Dear god, these images are beautiful!  Now regarding balance:  I still do not like the idea of any minuses to ability scores. I feel that inspires min-maxing more than anything else. It pigeonholes your race far more than any other feature could, and 5e has done a lot to avoid pigeonholing, from not locking players in to using specific weapons like it did in 4e to having most classes depend on only 1 or 2 stats at most to putting the stat cap at 20.  That having been said, I'll ignore the -2 to strength for now.  Speed: Iiiinteresting.   Sensate: Why can't it blocked?   Chitinous Exoskeleton: Ooh, harsh, but also wowza, that's a pretty great starting AC. I can understand why though; an arthropod's skeleton is on the outside - their bones are their armor. I think I agree with /u/Pixie1001 on the AC 12 rating.  Do Mantis' use their scythes to climb? I thought they were more intended for grabbing prey and defending itself. But then again, these aren't pure mantises; they're mantis-folk.  Restless: While it is true that insects do not sleep, they do go in to a kind of Suspended Animation, where their heart slows and they stop all activity. I recommended changing the wording to be regarding Suspended Animation rather than light activity.  Division of Gender: Any reason for choosing to make females smaller than males? Gender Dimorphism in mantises generally tend towards females being thicker and larger than the males.  Woah woah woah, not only do you separate between Male and Female, and thus give additional features as a consequence of that, you also provide subraces, adding to an already robust base class? And the subrace features definitely appear excessive. Permanent immunity to charm starting at level 3? Spending Hit Die to make additional opportunity attacks? Permanent Zone of Truth starting at level 5?  I'm not entirely sure what to do with the subraces. You've obviously worked very hard on them. But I think giving them the -2 to strength definitely tipped the balance too hard, as it justified more features than we're accustomed with."
UnearthedArcana,39rtbw,Leuku,2,Sun Jun 14 08:34:50 2015 UTC,"Yes they are - they inspired me to make the race in the first place :D  In the latest iteration of the Mantids from the feedback I have gained from these threads I have removed the ability score reduction entirely as yes, it is much more 3.5/Pathhfinder than 5e and doesnt belong.  haha, I have modified the wording of the flight to make it less abusable.  Message cannot be blocked as per the wording of the spell since they are all relevant as per the whispering aspect of Message. This version is flavoured telepathy but maybe it's a bit much, haha.  I have modified Chitinous Exoskeleton. With the scythe thing I have cut the climbing advantage, but kept the reactionary grab thing since I would like them to have some benefit of the additional limbs.  I have changed restless to Torpor. Pretty much exactly as you specified now  The gender dimorphism is more based on the inspiration images than on scientific accords of Mantises.  Those subraces... probably shouldn't be labelled as subraces. They are unique augmentations, really - they can be given through the game by the DM (or... not given) and are not something I intended as part of the racial balance overall.  Thanks for the feedback! I'd love to hear more from you when I am ready with the second iteration :D"

UnearthedArcana,39rtbw,Lord_of_Hydras,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:59:06 2015 UTC,"I have xposted this from /r/DnD Here is my context post:  The intention for the Mantid is for them to be decently strong in Wisdom and Dexterity based classes, but also give them room to focus on Intelligence and Charisma based classes with an obvious deficiency in Strength based ones. The gender choice IS the subrace choice, while the subraces are intended to be extremely powerful but not normally up for picking (it depends on the stage of my campaign when I might grant one).  Lurshelan is a nautical/sea based campaign. There is no Feywild but there are two 'Archfey' - powerful immortal creatures that dwell on the Isle of Abrasador. There are only two Archfey in the current iteration of the setting - the Spider Lord 'Akarok' and the Princess of Summer 'Camellia.  Please take a look at my race! Let me know what you think / give feedback etc."

UnearthedArcana,39nwca,eir411,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:40:08 2015 UTC,"I never really got into Star Gate, but from the attached fluff I'd say you've covered all of your bases - using Musicus's point system it rounds out to about 6 or 5.5 points (depending on how you'd rank their Feed Ability), which I would say is about the average, so that all checks out.  In addition you do really well making them feel faster, smarter and stronger than regular humans without breaking balance, which is awesome. Over all, really well done.  I'd maybe put their feed ability or a once per day or short rest cooldown, cut back how fast it makes enemies age (maybe just 1D6 years) and make it permanent. I mean, most of the time you're probably not going to be using it on anyone you wouldn't be able to kill anyway."
UnearthedArcana,39nwca,Pixie1001,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:27:04 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of making it a short rest ability but I decided not to for fluff reasons. It originally was a carbon copy of the Vampire's Bite Attack and restored HP but I figured that could be abused, so I made it Temp HP so they didn't stack. I didn't make the aging permanent because I figured that could be abused somehow, but now that you mention it, it wouldn't get used on someone not able to be killed.  Thanks for the suggestions!"
UnearthedArcana,39nwca,Pixie1001,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:09:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not really familiar with Stargate lore, as I said earlier, but I guess that's probably a good enough justification - as is, all the safty nets you've laid down to stop abuse means its probably fine.  Using temporary HP was also an excellent call.  The only lther thing I'd maybe look into - and again, I don't know anything about the fluff, so maybe this isn't an issue but currently the average wraith adventurer pretty never needs to sleep or eat since they can just heal exhaustion on every single goblin they kill - which will probably be like at least 12 a day - if not more - for your average murder hobo.  So I'd probs just say it only heals exhaustion incurred from their hunger feature (sorry, I can't remember the name). If they don't need to eat - in a conventional sense anyway - I'd probs just add that in as a seperate feature."
UnearthedArcana,39nwca,Pixie1001,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:24:42 2015 UTC,"My bad. My logic was pretty much that its a thing that is required by them to survive, so it would be awkward limiting it to a short rest ability.  The Wraith don't eat normal food, or sleep normally as far as I am aware. They hibernate but that is an uncommon thing. You're 100% right in that they pretty much would never need to eat or sleep. This was an unintentional byproduct of how I decided to make this feature. Do you think that not requiring sleep would be a problem?"
UnearthedArcana,39nwca,Pixie1001,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:44:34 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... It's hard to say - I mean, they needs to take a long rest to use their abilities anyway, so it isn't like they can just keep going forever - and the game already allows for the average party to rotate themselves around on watch anyway so it isn't like they'd be that much stronger.  It could be a bit weird having a race that doesn't need to sleep, but does it anyway because game mechanics.  All in all the awkwardness of needing to murder people whilst within populated areas provably evens things out.

UnearthedArcana,39nwca,FullmetalCowgirl,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:45:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah it only works on humanoids. That was my first thought for the ability. I think what I may do is add a feature similar to the Elf's Trance, so they need 4 hours or so. to be fair, the Wraith that I have on paper is not 100% the Wraith that the show portrays. In the show, Wraith can go for weeks without feeding or getting exhausted. Hell, they hibernated for 10,000 years. The appropriate modifiers for an actual Wraith would probably be +4 CON, +4 DEX. They all pretty much have some level of mind controlish abilities as well. With that in mind, I had to make some changes to make them fit into the DnD system. Adding the necessity for sleep wouldn't be a big stretch."

UnearthedArcana,39591v,lesser_futhark,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:42:32 2015 UTC,"Also, what do people think of the first level feature?   The Old One's telepathy is nice, but it's ultimately there for flavor. It's got a couple fun uses, but it's what the dev team calls a ""fluff power"" - something that is nice to have, makes the class feel like what it is, and isn't of a power level that impacts class balance.   Likewise, being a cat is a nice fluff power about on parity with the telepathy. There's lots of things you can do as a cat that'd help, but it doesn't in any way break game balance.   Question, though: Can a Warlock shift into and out of cat form any number of times, assuming they haven't been reduced to 0 HP? You say it follows the Druid rules, and I'm pretty sure the Druid rules cap the number of Wild Shape shapeshifts on something to do with the Wisdom modifier, which I'd assume wouldn't apply in this case."
UnearthedArcana,39591v,BeurredeTortue,0,Tue Jun 9 22:47:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah they can shift as many times as they want - I added the on death penalty as a amendment to the Wild Shape uses.  My thinking was that since the Cat only has 2 HP, even with infinite uses, it would be pretty hard to abuse in combat scenarios.  And the problem with the Old One's fluff power was that they seem to have it instead of the combat related Fiend and Fey pact features. I don't have the book on me, but I think the Fey could use it to teleport and the Fiend's got temporary HP from kills, which is pretty powerful and holds almost no fluff potential :/  The only conclusion I can think to draw is that either a) the devs thought the unique power of permanant telepathy had enough utility to float or b) The Great Old One has a feature later on that's far superior to the other pacts that make up for it.  Anyway, do you think I should add a second 1st level feature then, most likely based around mobility or evasion?"
UnearthedArcana,39591v,BeurredeTortue,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:58:16 2015 UTC,"the Fey could use it to teleport and the Fiend's got temporary HP from kills   For the Fey, you're thinking of Misty Escape, their level 6 feature.   The Archfey level 1 feature is Fey Presence, which allows you to Charm or Fear a group of creatures for an intensely short amount of time, which is absolutely a fluff power on par with Telepathy or Being a Cat.   The Fiend level 1 seems to be the outlier here - it's a combat power, but not an especially powerful one. It contributes to the Fiend's themes of being brutal and powerful, but sacrifices out of combat utility for a small yet useful combat bonus.   Honestly? Unless I was a Bladelock, I'd much rather Be a Cat."
UnearthedArcana,39591v,BeurredeTortue,0,Tue Jun 9 23:04:19 2015 UTC,I suppose when you put it like that the ability to fit in small spaces/travel unrecognised is probably fairly well balanced then.

UnearthedArcana,38xn0y,Strangecraft,3,Sun Jun 7 18:43:21 2015 UTC,"These are really awesome and well put together, although I do feel that the Machine patron wasn't very well thought out. Their battle fist feature doesn't scale at all, and is more or less rendered redundant by choosing the Pact of the Blade - not to mention the fact that the further bonuses presumably don't stack with said pact since the fist isn't technically a 'pact weapon'.  The level 10 feature is also a little silly since by default Warlocks can't pick up close range cantrips (to the best of my knowledge, I don't have the book with me). I guess they could just use it at disadvantage or shoot at a distant target, but it just feel kinda meh. I'd probably just give them a short rest based high damage melee attack that increases at 5th, 11th and 17th levels with the rest of their cantrips. Or just give them Shocking Grasp instead and think up a new level 10 feature.  Otherwise the rest look pretty well thought out, although the Rogue seemed a little niche, but I get that it's designed with a mech heavy steam punk campaign in mind, so it's probably fine as is.  Keep up the good work :)"
UnearthedArcana,38xn0y,Pixie1001,0,Mon Jun 8 13:13:40 2015 UTC,"You can attach the battlefist to your off hand, allowing you to two weapon fight. And since the battlefist isn't technically held, you can still cast spells without taking War Caster. The Eldritch Fist feature also dramatically boosts your melee damage output by giving you a free auto-hitting cantrip whenever you hit with an attack. We should probably edit the wording of that feature a bit. You shouldn't have disadvantage since the attack roll was for the battlefist, not the spell. Also, you should only be able to use that feature on one attack per turn."
UnearthedArcana,38xn0y,Whyareyoufollowingme,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:54:45 2015 UTC,"So in effect, you'd use the result to determine whether you caved in their skill with your robo-fist and all four (at higher levels) rays from your Eldritch Blast? If so, I guess that levels out pretty well - although I definitely didn't get that from the description (Although I understand the struggles of editing XD).  In that case, since I guess since you could attack with the fist as well as the pact blade on the same turn whilst holding a rod the Pact Blade still works and although still pretty squishy, Eldritch Fist would make them viable in melee and I guess it's still pretty useful as general utility - although not bring finesse does sorte of make it rather pointless for casual use since I'd think you'd still be better off pick up more AC than occationally using a slightly improved melee attack :/  But maybe there's something in the balance I'm not considering."
UnearthedArcana,38xn0y,Pixie1001,0,Tue Jun 9 03:53:42 2015 UTC,"We considered making it a finesse weapon, but ultimately decided against it for a few reasons. Doing so would make it just a bit too powerful, as you would be able to dump strength and bump up your dexterity with no consequences. Combined with the Armored Body embedded component, the Armor of Shadows Invocation, and a dex score of just 16, you're running around with a base AC of 18, without even wearing any armor. God forbid you pick up more AC by multiclassing into something with Unarmored Defense or finding a ring of protection or something. Having all that AND being reliable with your battlefist is too broken.  Also, when have you ever reeled back and decked somebody using your dexterity? The battlefist is all about brute strength."
UnearthedArcana,38xn0y,Whyareyoufollowingme,2,Tue Jun 9 05:55:18 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I figured it was something to do the amount of free invocations you gave him tipping the balance way over the edge. I suppose the damage Eldritch Fist can do makes stacking Strength worth it as well even if it make you a little lackluster early on (Most of the vannila classes have this issue as well anyway though, so I guess that's in line with the intended balance as well). Thanks for taking the time to explain your think process to me :)"

UnearthedArcana,38vyfe,Omega_Advocate,2,Sun Jun 7 14:10:28 2015 UTC,"Giving the battlemasters more versatility is alright, to a certain degree. Making him flat out stronger, while he is already arguably the best fighter subclass isn´t. (your version more than DOUBLES the amount of superiority dice fighters get as they level up, that´s insane)  The new maneuvers are alright (apart from Masterful Maneuver, which imo needs some rules clarification, since atm I don´t think it works with the ""one maneuver per attack only"" clause that battlemasters have), but once again just add more versatility (and therefore power) to a class that didn´t need it in the first place.   If you want to play a fighter with a lot of decisionmaking, I´d suggest reworking the battlemaster entirely, giving him tons of attack/movement/defensive options and more superiority ""points"" but not adding any damage to the offensive options. (For example, a maneuver could be ""As an action, you may disengange and move up to your speed. Afterwards, take the attack action"")  Edit: Typo´s"
UnearthedArcana,38vyfe,Omega_Advocate,2,Mon Jun 8 15:18:28 2015 UTC,"What about reducing the superority die to d6's to start to reduce overall damage output?  Also sorry on the edit, but masterful manuever is supposed to be 18th level feature that applies to all manuevers"
UnearthedArcana,38vyfe,Omega_Advocate,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:52:42 2015 UTC,"If you go ahead with your versatility/utility buffs then the endproduct has to have a (singnificantly) lower average DPR, it doesn´t matter how your compensation change looks like in the end.  I just don´t think that it´s a smart thing to do, to be honest. Your premise for these changes is that the fighter felt lackluster to you in later levels, but compared to what? I don´t think there´s a better martial meelee class than the battlemaster, with paladin and barbarian beeing on an comparable powerlevel (in my experience at least), so I don´t see the need to any changes to the subclass in the first place, at least when it comes to balance. Furthermore, you stated that ""it's not so much in damage that the battle master suffers, just in additional options"", yet you gave the fighter loads of buffs that increase his damage directly or indirectly (Feinting Attack, Sweeping Attack directly increase damage, Distracting Attack and Commanders Attack indirectly increase damage).  On another note, I think Disarming Attack is a bit too good at later levels with your version. It basically renders most enemies who rely on their weapons useless (and with your version you have more dice to do it more often, and at lvl 18 they even get disadvantage) as long as you have a free hand, which isn´t that hard to accomplish. Most problematic of all, currently the ""you may catch it if you have a free hand"" works with ranged attacks like a hand crossbow, which I don´t think is intended.  Also, currently your new Lunging strike and your Fading strike do exactly the same (i.e. allow you to attack at a starting distance of 5/10/15ft)  I think you have to think about your design goal again. If you want changes because you felt the battlemaster was weak, then I don´t think you played him to the best of his potential. (I do hope that you actually played the subclass at the level where you thought he was weak, and this isn´t only theorycrafting) The battlemaster is very much on par with other martial meelee classes, if not significantly ahead at later levels. If you instead aimed to introduce meaningful decision making, then I´d argue that your current version failed at that, since it´s really only a battlemaster on steroids. (Decisionmaking actually means even less with more dice, since the individual dice doesn´t matter as much).  I´ve followed another persons attempt at a ""versatile decisionmaking fighter"" with a lot of interest, where I really think he has worked out how such maneuvers should look like. Apart from the Maneuvers, his class looks rough around the edges, and a bit on the unbalanced side, but the maneuver design is amazing (this is the link to said class https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zHLtUBIOpuzbhov9Jk6GsCgftm1TIb2_Q8oHBWo26Jk/mobilebasic?pli=1 )"
UnearthedArcana,38vyfe,Omega_Advocate,2,Mon Jun 8 17:31:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback.    I'm a DM, so I haven't played the character directly, but had a player do so.  We had talked a little after a few games, and were trying to speculate as to the power growth at higher level.    Looking back at the edits, it does seem to be that you are correct that I did buff damage more than I originally surmized.  (Though, I don't think so in commander's strike since you have to sacrifice an attack for each ally to make one).    I think the idea behind giving the fighter more die was that I didn't like the idea of the fighter running out of dice during a fight - it seemed sort of anti climactic; also breaks realism a bit if the fighter suddenly can't out maneuver an opponent because...he got tired maybe.    I have some fixes I think I can make, and will edit."
UnearthedArcana,38vyfe,Omega_Advocate,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:31:01 2015 UTC,"Commanders strike is situational. If you have 2 of Paladin/Raging Barbarian/Rogue who failed to sneak attack on his turn/Cleric with Divine Strike nearby, then Commanders attack is an indirect damage increase, since one single of your attacks is likely to deal less damage than one single of their attacks, coupled with beeing able to use one superiority die to strengthen two attacks. Actually because of that, you really only need two people that deal similar damage to yours to indirectly increase your damage.   I think the idea behind giving the fighter more die was that I didn't like the idea of the fighter running out of dice during a fight - it seemed sort of anti climactic; also breaks realism a bit if the fighter suddenly can't out maneuver an opponent because...he got tired maybe.   I dunno, I think saying that maneuvers are physically taxing to the point to where you can only do X of them per short rest is realistic, or as close to realism as D&D gets.   I have some fixes I think I can make, and will edit.   I know that I might be an asshole right now, but you still haven´t told me what the actual reason for wanting to change it is. If it´s really only beeing worried that the battlemaster fighter doesn´t stack up to other martial meelee classes, then I´d put that worry to rest until you are actually there. Even then, there ´s way easier fixes to making him relevant, like letting him a find a really good magic weapon later on, no need to change the class around for balance reasons.   If it´s about the ""feel"" of the class, then well, I already wrote about that."
UnearthedArcana,38vyfe,Ashkelon,2,Tue Jun 9 00:16:35 2015 UTC,"I put some reasoning in the edit above, but I think part of it was that I wanted the battle master to encompass a few more warrior themes, like the warlord for instance.  As far as commander's strike is concerned, in those edge cases, it might be more powerful, but the thematic possibilities are worth a potential extra d8.  I know that divine strike is only available once per turn, and at higher levels, if I can let the rogue attempt sneak attack again, it's about the same as granting advantage on the last attack.  I'm willing to let my players have that I think.  As for why I'm adjusting things in general, I tend to tinker with all my games, in most ways - so there is that."

Why are intricate gadgets given at such a crazy high level when they have average effects. Some of them give you the effects of a 4th or 5th level spell one per short rest at 17th level and at a huge gold and time cost for a below mediocre effect.  I would suggest  changing advanced and intricate levels. Change advanced gadget slots per level to 4 at 15th level and you gain 1 intricate at 15 level. Then change the scaling to 1/1/2/2/3/3.  Then it kinda makes sense.

No matter how good you are at squeezing, you shouldn't be able to fight normally when stuck in a small space where you can't even dodge. The normal effects of squeezing are double movement cost, disadvantage on attack rolls and dex saves, and enemies get advantage on attacks against you. Removing your attack roll penalty could make sense, even removing the movement cost, but removing the defensive penalties is a bit much I think. Nimble dodge should be ""move up to half your speed"". Its an interesting effect, but the name nimble dodge doesn't really fit it because it doesn't have any effect on your actual ability to dodge. Its also awfully arbitrary. Why should a mouse running at full speed every round be able to run faster if attacks are missing him? How about ""when an attack misses you, you can use your reaction to take the dodge action""? Or Scurry: all opportunity attacks made against you for moving out of an enemy's reach are made at disadvantage? Or maybe only the first opportunity attack each turn? I like the subrace name change, but they still don't stand out as meaningful choices beyond the stat boost. I also think you've given them too many features. Halflings get 2 major features (lucky and halfling nimbleness), 1 minor feature (brave), and another from their subrace (I'd say lightfoot gets another major one, but the stout feature only has a very minor impact on any character). But your race gets 2 or 3 majors (keen senses, nimble dodge, and maybe the weapon training), and 3 minors (squirm, critter speak, and one from the subrace). You could cut that count down by 1 if you remove brave and move speak with small beasts over there instead. I think you should put weapon training in the subraces. A hunter / gatherer would more likely grow up learning the spear, club, and sling than rapier and short sword. Or you could remove it to help solve the problem of having too many features."

Evasion and Improved Evasion are good for denying effects.  For advanced abilities, maybe adding a second stat bonus onto saves against spells, or using a more favourable one...or alternatively, an AC bonus specifically against the attack rolls of spells. At mid to high level give them an ability to make an emulate check to counterspell without casting. Maybe the ability to disable magic traps like a rogue can nonmagical ones.

UnearthedArcana,38ikmj,jgclark,5,Thu Jun 4 13:28:05 2015 UTC,"Someone had fun writing those curses!  I didn't read them all, but I love the thought put into them and the new wrinkles each introduced.  Great work overall on those.  One ability that really popped out at me, though:   Battlecry is just too good.  I know this is based off of Sacred Weapon, but Charisma is a secondary stat for Paladins, meaning the boost is generally +2-3, and they have to sacrifice a lot if they want +5; the Oracle has Charisma as its primary stat, and making it a party buff is many times more powerful than a boost to one character's weapon attacks.  As it stands, this would be the best party buff in the game, from any spell, feature, or item I know of, by a huge distance.  Ideas: you could make it effect all allies within 60ft, giving them the bonus on their next attack only, or maybe something that has a small radius and grants a buff to all allies standing in the area, like a conventional Paladin aura.   I'll read more of the mysteries if I have time, there are quite a few, and they are packed with class features."
UnearthedArcana,38ikmj,Adraius,2,Thu Jun 4 16:37:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Battlecry should probably last for a single round and maybe trigger as a bonus action."
UnearthedArcana,38ikmj,Adraius,3,Thu Jun 4 20:28:26 2015 UTC,"I like the sound of that.  I'd also recommend changing it to simply once per short rest, both a) to be consistent with how class features work elsewhere (the only thing that works similarly to what you describe that I know of is the Healer feat), and b) to prevent it from being crazy powerful for those using the mass combat rules or otherwise having large scale battles."
UnearthedArcana,38ikmj,Adraius,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:38:28 2015 UTC,"The Inspiring Leader feat works that way, too, which is why I wrote it that way, but switching it to a simple one use per short or long rest might be better.

I can walk back and forth in this way to maintain my rage - is that intended, or an abuse of mechanics?  Free Step: An incredibly powerful bundle of abilities. I'd recommend breaking it down - as The Dance is marginally weaker than feels appropriate, I'd move ""spells and other magical effects cannot reduce your speed to 0 nor cause you to be paralyzed or restrained"" from Free Step to The Dance, and make it applicable only while Raging. Seems to be a better thematic fit for raging, rather than something that's just part of the baseline experience.  Waterfall Step: Does this saving throw vs prone resolve before or after the attack?

Spellsword's recovery: Very strong, I'd limit it to twice a level at 6th level, and only per long rest. At 12th, it increases to three times, and at 18, four times.  Arcane Strike: I'd change is so that when you attack an adjacent target with a spell, you can then attack with a weapon as a bonus attack. If that doesn't suit your flavor, I'd say that you add your INT to damage, stacking with STR. 2 attacks with a weapon when you could be casting a cool spell isn't really that good.

The hitpoints you get from mage armor aren´t that impressive in my opinion, and so you´re still left with a d6 hitdice class that suddenly wants to go meelee. You don´t even get a massive benefit in damage or anything for doing so until later levels, where you would still deal more damage if you were evocation or necromancy (and were you would be safe since youre not meelee)"

Granting resistance to psychic damage is one idea (Warlocks get it), as well as advantage on Intelligence saving throws, but I'm not sure. I'll keep an eye on it. It's easy enough to bump up the subclass' power if needs be."
UnearthedArcana,37y7ex,Slashlight,2,Mon Jun 1 09:42:36 2015 UTC,"You could give them Advantage on Concentration checks made while concentrating on Telekinesis. There's also the Catapult spell in the Elemental Evil supplement that you could look at. It deals 3d6 bludgeoning damage and may be appropriate for this class. Perhaps  allow them to cast it as a 1st level spell without consuming spell slots, effectively turning it into a cantrip. If that's a bit strong, put a cap on the number of times per day or short rest that they can do this."
UnearthedArcana,37y7ex,Slashlight,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:27:48 2015 UTC,"Fair suggestions. I had looked into catapult but I'm not sure I want to create another spell dependency. It also makes the feature a mess to write.  I think I'll leave it as is for now. I mean, I have given this wizard a free prepared spell, and that increases his versatility somewhat, even if only by a little. Can't overlook that fact!"
UnearthedArcana,37y7ex,Slashlight,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:45:33 2015 UTC,"The bonus prepared spell is a fair point. I still think that there's room for adding a bit of power to Telekinesis, though. The spell is alright by itself, more useful as a bit of utility than anything else. If the Arcanist is to specialize in it, as is suggested by the capstone feature being an enhanced version of it, I think it needs to be a bit more of a viable option in combat. Currently, you're able to remove one creature from the fight, but you aren't able to do much else as your action on each turn must be to maintain control of the effect, else the creature gets away. If there's a bunch of environmental stuff for you to play with, the spell gets a bit better, but that isn't usually the case. I think adding unique options to the spell for the Arcanist would be appropriate, if not simply adding a bit more power to it.  Something to the nature of:  You may use your action to hurl an unattended object at a target. The object must fit within a 5ft cube and be no heavier than 5lbs. Make a ranged spell attack against a target within 60ft. Targets struck take 2d6 bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage (depending on the object thrown) in addition to suffering any other effects of being struck by the object, such as fire damage in the case of a flask of alchemist's fire.  This option is similar to the Catapult spell, but weaker. It also allows players to use their resources or environment more creatively. At the very least, I think allowing the Arcanist to affect two targets at once would be appropriate. In this way, you'd be able to get real value out of the spell as opposed to simply removing both yourself and one enemy from the fight."
UnearthedArcana,37y7ex,Leuku,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:29:31 2015 UTC,"I like your idea of giving the Arcanist a unique action while Telekinesis is up. My only fear with that is there are just so many things you could do with that action it would be a bit of a rabbit hole to look into, and you run the risk of stepping on the toes of another spell.  What about making subsequent contests to hold a creature a bonus action? You would still need to use your action to grab hold in the first instance, but once a creature is in your grip not only is it hard for it to get out, thanks to adding your proficiency bonus to the contest, but you wont be completely shut out from doing other stuff.  I would word it something like this:   When a creature is held in your telekinetic grip, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to attempt to maintain your grip by repeating the ability contest. If a creature breaks free, you can't target that creature with this spell again until the start of your next turn."
UnearthedArcana,37y7ex,zoken,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:32:58 2015 UTC,"That could work. At the very least, you wouldn't be locking yourself out of other spells or actions each turn just to maintain your grip on a creature. Would this allow you to use your action to affect a second target or would you be limited to a single target at a time?"
UnearthedArcana,37y7ex,zoken,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:11:22 2015 UTC,"You would still be limited to 1 target, as per the spell's normal restrictions:   If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.   I know you could do things like allow for two medium or smaller creatures to be held at once, but then we'd be adding another buff to the spell. The list could go on and on. I think the bonus action thing is as far as I would go, at least until I had some playtest data.  Edited for clarity"

Giving a minor penalty on checks would work, or possibly imposing disadvantage on certain rolls for a round or two. There's a fair bit you can do short of causing outright fear.   Though, as an aside, fear isn't as powerful as you think. Fey patron Warlock gets an AoE charm or fear effect that lasts for one round at 1st level. So there is precedent.

Your back and short limbs are covered in spines. Using a basic action you can relax or flex your spines. During their relaxed state, you gain +1 AC. When they are flexed, you lose 1 AC (the quills poke through the leather) but gain the offensive benefits of spines. If you are grappled with your spines flexed, your opponent takes 2d6 piercing damage per turn. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. Spines must be relaxed or flexed.  Spinning Spikes. If you have atleast 20 feet from the creature, you can roll into a ball and make a Spinning Spike attack.

UnearthedArcana,37s7ag,the_singular_anyone,3,Fri May 29 23:31:35 2015 UTC,"I really like this concept-wise. It's nice and flavorful. Balance-wise, it doesn't look too bad.  If I were to do this, I would make it another Patron altogether. Sort of like a Monstrosity Patron. The whole process of transforming into a monster would make for cool class features and interesting role-playing opportunities!"
UnearthedArcana,37s7ag,eir411,3,Sat May 30 02:29:58 2015 UTC,"This is a really cool idea, but I feel that having to spend your invocation points on powers that are limited by your current resource pool kinda makes them dud options. Like with those stupid invocations that give you extra spells - nobody takes them.  Other than that I feel that the claw feature is a little to specific to be the default feature of the pact as well - unarmed attacks seem to be a very small part of what the pact is supposed to be about. I think maybe having something that just unlocks a large number of additional monster like powers would be better - maybe you could paxk the individual bonus power invocations into packets of 4 or so different powers as well to make them more worth while."
UnearthedArcana,37s7ag,Pixie1001,2,Sun May 31 14:30:21 2015 UTC,"I feel that having to spend your invocation points on powers that are limited by your current resource pool kinda makes them dud options   Y'know, I kind of agree. Especially considering you have to spend spell slots to activate them.  I like the idea of sacrificing some progression resources to achieve extra abilities, because that's kind of the name of the game, but the abilities are limited in scope and require further resources to use every combat.    maybe you could paxk the individual bonus power invocations into packets of 4 or so different powers as well to make them more worth while   I like where you're going with this, but I'd prefer to lump two independent Metamorphics into one Invocation rather than four. You'd get latitude, but not over-much in the way of options, and it'd be a bit of a payoff for having to spend a spell slot on them.   That would save on the ""there are a buttload of specific Invocations"" problem. Divorce Metamorphics from Invocations, and just make one Invocation that says ""Pick two Metamorphics from the list to know, you can choose this Invocation any number of times."" Keeps them different from the bogus Invocations that you mention, too.   the claw feature is a little to specific to be the default feature of the pact as well - unarmed attacks seem to be a very small part of what the pact is supposed to be about   Each Pact Bonus is supposed to introduce a solid way of doing damage, which is where I was coming from with Unarmed, an unique bonus otherwise unavailable to the Warlock.   But I totally get where you're coming from, and other folks have mentioned this. Rather than scale it down and phase it out, maybe buffing it up would be the proper way to go?  Maybe I should scale the die type with level. Having a Metamorphic that allows rerolls of 1's or 2's on damage and another that allows a third attack as a bonus action allows me to keep the die type down, but bumping it up to a d10 at some point doesn't feel especially overpowered, considering that Monks eventually get a d10 and Bladelocks often start with a d12.   Do you have any ideas for interesting things I can do with the Unarmed Attack? Adding Reach and Brutal seems natural, but I already have that. Maybe an ability that allows you to crit on a 19? Aside from that, I'm a little at a loss.  Please advise, kind and knowledgeable person.  EDIT: Monks only get a d10, not a d12, and even then it's only at level 17. If a d10 happens, it should absolutely be an endgame thing."
UnearthedArcana,37s7ag,Pixie1001,1 point,Sun May 31 22:33:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think cutting it down into 1 or 2 invocations choices than can be taken multiple times would probably be the go.  I think the main issue optimising with the unarmed bonus would be making it a viable replacement for Eldritch Blast. As it is you're pretty well better off just sacrificing the 1 damage and pulling out a knife instead of using your claws - esspeically since they can be retracted.  Maybe you should do a kind of barbarian rage type mechanic where the warlock starts ranged but can sacrifice the use of their traditional spells and cantrips for a certain amount of time to increase their AC and unarmed damage.  I don't know if a trade off mechanic like that would be to niche though, since it'd probably just end up as a 'Oh shit, I'm in melee for once. Better use that obscure ability I picked up 3 levels back to man mode my way out' power. But I don't know - that's probably the direction I would go in."
UnearthedArcana,37s7ag,Raidend,0,Mon Jun 1 04:32:46 2015 UTC,"while interesting, you should probably rethink the idea a little.   The metamorphic powers sound interesting but there is really no need to introduce another resource to track. Just make then as regular invocations. Also I don't think there's any need to make them require a new pact boon.   Talking about the new pact boon; it is a less good pact blade drop it entirely or think of something else."
UnearthedArcana,37s7ag,Raidend,1 point,Sat May 30 01:02:24 2015 UTC,"it is a less good pact blade drop it entirely or think of something else.   The core of it is, yeah. What makes it worthwhile are the pact-only Invocation abilities that you can activate, to buff yourself up and fully modify your playstyle.  You take a hit with the initial pact, but the pact-specific invocations even it out."
UnearthedArcana,37s7ag,Raidend,0,Sat May 30 01:08:05 2015 UTC,"that's the thing boon specific invocations should be the exception not the rule.   Many of the metamorphic invocations you have made are only tangentially related to the boon.   Look at other invocations that have that kind of requirements, in all cases they directly involve the pack boon.  Having ritual spells in your book, grating an extra attack with the pact blade, etc.   In your case they really don't have anything to do with it except because they use the flavor of mutations and such.  like /u/eir411 said it'll fit better as a different kind of patron than as a different pact boon"
UnearthedArcana,37s7ag,Raidend,2,Sat May 30 03:21:19 2015 UTC,"that's the thing boon specific invocations should be the exception not the rule.   I mean, I'm not sure why.   The balance seems to work just fine, roughly. I appropriated the available elements to make a unique concept - isn't that what homebrew is for?   Many of the metamorphic invocations you have made are only tangentially related to the boon.   But... that's the idea, isn't it? You're going from how you originated and turning into something else?  Not everything's going to be stacking unarmed attack, just like not everything you take on a bladelock is going to stack their sword-ing ability. The idea is to build a thematic class with a wider diversity of ability."
UnearthedArcana,37s7ag,Omega_Advocate,1 point,Sat May 30 03:34:10 2015 UTC,"You do realize that every invocation that has as requirement the pact blade enhance the pact blade, right?   The invocations are actually pretty good and balanced, what I'm saying is that there is little reason to make them dependant on the boon"
UnearthedArcana,37s7ag,Omega_Advocate,2,Sat May 30 03:51:26 2015 UTC,"You do realize that every invocation that has as requirement the pact blade enhance the pact blade, right?   Right, it's the thematic focus of the invocations, the way metamorphosis is the thematic focus of these invocations. The invocations deliver more blade-ing to the bladelock, and more becoming to the becominglock.   I also feel it'd be weird if a warlock with a familiar or a tome started turning into things - it'd be tonally divergent. Each pact boon is supposed to be about its own thing, and while it'd be nice to spread these around, their flavor and purpose is specific to this pact.   I'm glad you think the balance is on the nose though - it's been a bitch and a half to balance something this diverse."
UnearthedArcana,37qeho,hazeyindahead,2,Fri May 29 15:56:12 2015 UTC,"So I use this ruleset instead of the rules for interacting and fighting along side an animal companion.  Effectively an animal companion following these rules would be like having another character to use. Their actions are limited at first, but with more training it is possible to develop a very effective partnership.  Attunement is sort of funny, the companion takes one of your slots, but the animal also has 3 slots of its own."
UnearthedArcana,37qeho,ShmooelYakov,3,Fri May 29 15:58:16 2015 UTC,The only thing I have any concern over is the idea of picking 5 talents/feats each morning. Seems to add in a lot of Wizard-like utility and unrealistic regarding an actually trained animal.
UnearthedArcana,37qeho,ShmooelYakov,1 point,Fri May 29 16:50:03 2015 UTC,"You have a point.  The idea is that you would, with enough time, train the animal everything.  Keeping it to 5 active abilities prevents too much power creep while still allowing the player the opportunity to train their animal."
UnearthedArcana,37qeho,ShmooelYakov,2,Fri May 29 17:11:19 2015 UTC,"I could maybe understand tiers of feats. So you can only have 5 talents/feats max, but you could continue to train them in those skills and over time improve upon them and increasing their effectiveness. And if you find that a certain skill/talent is not what you want then you could always retrain them. A well-trained animal picks up on new talents more quickly. Especially when you maintain a specific training methodology, they realize that they should be learning this new action."
UnearthedArcana,37qeho,ShmooelYakov,1 point,Fri May 29 17:21:40 2015 UTC,"Thats an excellent idea!  I would only have to add a third training option - upgrade feat/ability and probably have it be 45 days of downtime.  I would still maintain the 5 feat max, but maybe for those that wish to specialize, they can get an upgrade to an existing feat and have that upgrade take up a slot too.  One feat, upgraded, two slots used.  Ill run this by the author of the document and see what he thinks."
UnearthedArcana,37qeho,ShmooelYakov,2,Fri May 29 17:44:59 2015 UTC,Or the upgraded would/could replace the existing.
UnearthedArcana,37qeho,jwbjerk,1 point,Fri May 29 17:51:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course, the power level could only be enough to replace instead of stack with its original benefits, depending on what is being upgraded"
UnearthedArcana,37qeho,Dulenheim,2,Fri May 29 18:00:54 2015 UTC,"So I'm trying to think of it like dog training. To get them to learn complex commands you start with simple commands, but once they're ingrained they're pretty ingrained. You then build off of those commands and increase the complexity. I want to almost think of this as more of a skill tree, like in a RTS or something. You never really forget the building blocks, and each building block reduces the length of time for the next and more complex building block. Especially if you have all the roots down, it's hard to teach a dog to roll over if they don't all ready lie down on command. Now, if you gave the companion different skill trees for different companion types. Below are some random concepts. And to clarify, I like the idea presented I'm just presenting some thoughts on potential tweaks. It's still great though.  Offensive Tree  Defensive Tree  Stealth Tree  Communication Tree  Entertainment Tree  Bonding Tree"

UnearthedArcana,37iuz3,Bronze_Johnson,6,Wed May 27 23:15:52 2015 UTC,"the metamagus is cute but I think it has too many meta points. I would probably limited it to half its wizard level. The rapid preparation basically gives you your int mod extra prepared spells. Instead allow the wizard to cast a spell he hasn't prepare by paying some meta points (spell level + 1) and expending a slot of the appropriate level.     The techno magus sounds pretty cool and actually very balanced as far as I can tell. Although the last ability seems a bit weak, maybe keep the limit to only level 1 spells but allow any level of slot. Also you should probably limit this ability to be used only once per day."
UnearthedArcana,37iuz3,Raidend,5,Thu May 28 04:33:05 2015 UTC,"I suppose some people will like this, I personally do not. I like that sorcerers get metamagic and wizards do not. To each their own."
UnearthedArcana,37iuz3,Morrowlife,3,Thu May 28 00:49:40 2015 UTC,"I agree, just as much from a balance standpoint as a thematic one. Metamagic is the only base (non bloodline) class feature that Sorcerers have. Giving it to Wizards, even in a reduced form, is stepping on the Sorcerer's toes pretty heavily, and the class gets enough flack as it is for being less powerful than the Wizard."

Quick question though: If a Blue Mage gets hit by a spell of a higher magic level than he is does he learn the spell and only gain the ability to use it when he reaches that level, or can he use it as soon as the learn it even if he level is lower than the spell's, or is he incapable of learning the spell if its of a higher level?"

UnearthedArcana,3796cn,CobaltBlue,6,Mon May 25 22:07:01 2015 UTC,"I think one or two of these three things could round out the class well, but never all three of them. I don´t like the sorcerer subclasses presented in unearthed arcana particularly much exactly because they add so many more spelloptions and makes it feel like a charisma wizard. I also don´t think that the sorcerer is somehow a ""weak"" class, he focuses on quality through metamagic instead of quantity and in my opinion, he does it well. Twinned haste is incredibly powerful in the right parties, twinned disintegrate has absurd blast potential, heightened spell slow is incredible with how many monster in 5e have multiattack. He has tons of metamagic options for roleplaying which combines with his main CHA attribute to make him exceptional in those situations. I think most people who found the sorcerer weak play it like a wizard, and then they´re disappointed because it wasn´t as ""strong"".   I don´t like the enhanced spell list and I think the capstone is flat out broken (and you called it a ""slight bump in power"") but I really like the sorcerer points regeneration feat. I will probably think about a better capstone (though, not as broken as a 2nd level 9 spellslot) for my sorcerer player, if I implement that level 3 feat."
UnearthedArcana,3796cn,Omega_Advocate,1 point,Tue May 26 10:53:21 2015 UTC,"Almost every time someone mentions where sorcerers are very strong its based around ""twin spell"". But twinning is not an integral part of being a sorcerer, many sorcerers may not take it at all.  I'm not sure slow is all that~ powerful in your example considering Heightened can affect only one monster of a spell designed to hit many monsters, and which gets to resave against the effects every turn.  And again, many sorcerers may not even have those metamagics. Imagine a sorcerer who starts with subtle spell and distant spell for flavor reasons instead of twin and heighten and see if you think they are still as strong. Admittedly this is a problem with the metamagics not being super balanced more than anything.   edit (this paragraph): So anyone who does want their sorcerer to have the ability to be strong is sort of bullied into taking those two, (2/3 of what you get before 17 RAW (which most people never even get to)), which further limits your ability to give your character the flavor you want. I don't think of the additional metamagics as making them significantly more powerful, as powergamers will already be taking and using the most powerful metamagics anyway, you can't combine them with the exception of Empowered. But they allow me to take subtle spell at level 1 without feeling like I'm gimping my char by not taking twin spell because there will be a chance to take it as my character matures.  I think the extra spells are great because unlike wizard you can't know everything, just your specialty, but they provide enough utility to be useful and enough flavor to make you feel~ like you are draconic, or wild (or storm or favored). They also make you feel like you are made of magic by giving you more magical options, as opposed to RAW in which despite being made of magic you get completely shafted on spell selection AND get fewer spells per day. Which sucks.  If you think the capstone is overpowered, I can see your point on that. I'm just not sure what to replace it with if the sorcerer already gets some sorcerers points back. I would want it to strongly represent the fact that magic is what a sorcerer IS not what a sorcerer DOES, it is in their very blood. Which I think the class RAW does a pretty terrible job of making you feel.   (edit: this paragraph): My instinct is to give them more spell slots somehow, but it seems difficult after they've gone through the trouble of unifying the spell slots and balancing around it.  Maybe they could just get a bump to the max sorcery points? Or an additional level 5 slot instead? EDIT-EDIT: Changed capstone to a lvl 5 slot."
UnearthedArcana,3796cn,Omega_Advocate,1 point,Wed May 27 04:13:28 2015 UTC,"I can definitely see where you´re coming from, but I don´t agree with a lot of what you said. The wizard is also forced into a certain selection of spells if he wants to be strong, just that the selection is that much larger. But if a player wants to pick the evocation school, and then take no damaging cantrip at all for ""flavor reasons"" he´s going to suck as well. And yes ""only"" picking subtle and distant spell can be amazing as well if you´re playing a political intrigue campaign for example.  As to your point of ""beeing made out of magic should give you more spells"" I don´t believe that. In my mind, a beeing made out of magic has less spells than someone studying them and engraving them in their spellbook with research (intelligence) and instead is so familiar with them that he can alter them at will (metamagic).  But as I said I can definitely see where you´re coming from, so if you and/or your group is happy with these changes, go for it. Just keep in mind that some people might not agree with your opinion of what makes a sorcerer a sorcerer, or if you can consider his base design weak.

See invis: Dragons don't really have this quality in 5e. I'd swap this out.  Here is my version if you want to take a look.  My changes to Sorc overall:   Houserule (Buff): Sorcerers gain 2 metamagic at level 3 as normal, and gain an additional one at 7, 11, 15, and 19. Houserule (Buff): Sorcerous Restoration. At 5th level you regain 2 expended sorcery point whenever you finish a short rest. This increases to 3 at 10, 4 at 15, and 5 at 20. Houserule (Buff): Give extra spells known. See Sorcerous Origins Houserule (Buff): Add Melf’s Acid Arrow to the Sorcerer spell list as a 2nd level spell. Clarification: Dragon sorcs that already have resistance from another source (ex: Dragonborn) will receive something equally as powerful. Houserule (Nerf): Twinned haste is not allowed.

Fly spell enables them to fly for a price (with concentration) at a level that players actually commonly get to, and can provide flying for the rest of the party after they get the wings for themselves.  Dragons have blindsight, this is the closest spell equivalent.  I don't like absorb element as half the spell benefit only benefits melee, so won't benefit most sorcerers. The other half (element resistance) of the spell is something draconic can already get anyway so isn't that useful.  Chromatic orb on the other hand gives another guaranteed way to do your elements damage (providing you have the diamond)."

That´s why an ogre, a large creature, deals 2d8+str mod damage with a ""large"" Greatclub, instead of the normal 1d8+mod. This is also the reason why the goliath with a size of 8 feet still only is medium sized, since he´s a playable character. Even if your ""large races"" noted that they don´t gain bigger damage dice, the hitpoint buff would be, as you feared, very much overpowered. It´s basically another free stat increase in constitution, and it´s even better than that since a large fighter with 20 con has more hp than a medium fighter with 20 con. I also have no idea how a sentient hare or otter is bigger than a 8 feet tall goliath."

Besides carrying capacity and the amount of space they take up, I haven't seen much in the PHB that defines how ""large"" is different. Anyway, if he doesn't want to grant an extra damage die, all he has to do is include that in the description.   I also have no idea how a sentient hare or otter is bigger than a 8 feet tall goliath.   These creatures are aproximately their real size.  Small/Med/Large are redefined."

I admit that this isn´t exactly spelled out like that, but I think it´s very much RAI. DMG p. 278 says ""Big monsters typically wield oversized weapons that deal extra dice of damage on a hit."" Now I guess you could rule that a large creature nevertheless uses a normal sized sword, even though it might be impractical, but that wouldn´t prevent them from picking up an ogre club or forging an oversized weapon, and using it with proficiency since they are large enough to wield it, which I´m very much sure isn´t intended. (which, again, is why there are no large player races)   Anyway, if he doesn't want to grant an extra damage die, all he has to do is include that in the description.   True, but that doesn´t change the fact that the large creature hitpoint increase would break racial balance, as I already wrote. (I could go into longer detail about why the hp gain from the hill dwarf doesn´t break racial balance in contrast, but it´s somewhat much to write) To fix this, he could make, for example, the badger medium, but increase their carry capacity, which basically does the same as increasing it´s size, without all the possible problems attached.   These creatures are aproximately their real size. Small/Med/Large are redefined.   True, I glossed over the part where these races are meant to be used exlusively with each other."

Using hit dice one step larger only translates to one extra hitpoint per level, on average.  And one of the dwarf races flat out gets 1 extra HP per level.  This is slightly more powerful because they will get 1 extra HP (average) from each HD they roll resting-- but there are plenty of effects that give a much more significant boost.  You might argue that this in combination with everything else is overpowered, but this power by itself is well within the bounds of what PHB races can do."
UnearthedArcana,36vgo1,jwbjerk,2,Sat May 23 14:39:20 2015 UTC,"only translates to one extra hitpoint per level   Which makes it nearly as valuable an additional +2 Con. (except for saving throws). That would for example give his badger +2 Str and +2.5/3 Con, including a better rage version (since it allows cantrips) and 2 free proficiencies, and the other things that a large size does for you. That´s too much, compared to his small and medium races. I also don´t ever judge a feat from a race without consideration of the races other abilities, as context is key in situations like that.   And one of the dwarf races flat out gets 1 extra HP per level.   I actually said that in my earlier post. The reason that isn´t broken is because (short version), it doesn´t give strength or dexterity, which means that fighters and paladins can´t just become better armored berserkers, toughness-wise. Instead, it gives wisdom and constitution, thus enabling clerics and druids to have ""tank"" meelee builds that are actually viable from a min-max perspective, without giving them as much damage in meelee as a fighter or paladin. That´s balanced. If a fighter goes Hill Dwarf, he can´t reach 16 Str/Dex at level 1 (of course talking about point buy and standard stat array, rolling stat´s and talking about balance is somewhat futile), and he can´t get 18 str/dex at level 4, which are important milestones in 5e D&D. His badger and otter allow a fighter or a paladin to do that, while making them even more durable, and this breaks balance.  Also, can I take your silence about the oversized weapons part of our argument as an indication that you agree with me there?"

I´d find it very weird if a weapon wielded by a creature of my size and build somehow deals more damage with it than I can. I guess you could give every large or bigger monster an extra feat that lets them deal more damage with oversized weapons, so you can have a large PC, but I don´t think that´s worth it. After all, dwarfs and goliaths are both medium sized creatures, even though goliaths can be twice as big, so goliaths fulfill the role of ""large"" PC, without having to deal with the possible issues of an actual large size."

Varient human gets a feat. You get to pick your size category, the mending cantrip, the warforged living construct trait and 3 languages of your choice. It's a touch on the overpowered side.    That being said I do like Modrons, this fits the bill thematically. I've run the Modron March in the background of another campaign so I appreciate seeing that.

UnearthedArcana,36swu0,Omega_Advocate,2,Fri May 22 10:48:28 2015 UTC,"Compare this to Hold person, a 2nd level spell, and most of the time it will just be plain better. The fact that the target doesn´t get an immediate saving throw is ridiculous, and reserved to level 4 or higher spells and it doesn´t even require concentration.   Also the wording is somewhat problematic since either the target mimics the EXACT movements of the caster, which would develop into a highly difficult discussion if you count the exact distance a certain body part moved, or if it´s scaled in relation to body size. Then we´d have to argue what ""Body Type"" means. Do a dwarf and a human share the same body type? If you argue yes, then you can expand this to every bipedal creature of the same size category, and you have to think about what happens if a human and a dwarf are connected and the human makes one really large step, an impossible one for the dwarf. The most likely answer would be that the dwarf tries to make the biggest step he can, but if that´s so, it means the human can basically attack the dwarf with impunity, seeing as his arm is longer, and he will always have the longer reach, or if the humans uses his weapon in a way, where the dwarfs weapon doesn´t do anything (the piercing motion, for example)  So either you try to deal with all that stuff, or you make it simple game terms only= no single limb movement, but move/attack etc. That means that the spell loses all its flavor (at least in regards to the show) and is still a better Hold Person spell, which might even allow the user to make the target attack his own people by shooting ranged attacks in a certain direction, or making a throwing motion in a certain direction.  I think it´s a nice try to transfer the ability to D&D, but it only worked as it did in the show because , for example, they conveniently where the same body height and had the kunai on the exact same part of their body in the exam.

I´d personally make it a 4-5th level spell that targets humanoids only and has an initial save, but afterwards allows for every broken interaction you can think of, short of a hasted shadow imitiation into ready action into friend that puts a stake into enemy vampires hand into use ready action to self double kill into revivify combo, altough I haven´t got the slightest idea how you would rule that. Maybe add an exception that the target can´t directly harm itself, altough I feel that would take a bit of the fun away.  I´d only use this spell if my dm/my group is okay with it, and the DM get´s the final word on what´s possible and what isn´t. I find the concept really intriguing in a ""magic realistic"" game like D&D though, so I´m very tempted to playtest it and see what broken combos I can pull off.

UnearthedArcana,36jfn7,Cirrus5,4,Tue May 19 22:33:43 2015 UTC,"I originally intended to have the Star Child work for a GOO Warlock or Cleric (for the ""Eldritch domain"" I made a while back, which I put on the science-fantasy post) specifically, so that's an oversight on my behalf then."
UnearthedArcana,36jfn7,krispykremeguy,5,Tue May 19 23:14:35 2015 UTC,"Unless you're making a whole suite of custom races, these seem a bit overpowered to me, especially the Star Child subrace.   For the Eldritch-touched as a whole, I would not allow any Large PCs.  Even Goliaths (up to 8 feet tall and 340 lbs) are strictly Medium.  Going up to large opens up the ""increased weapon size"" can of worms, which is not a good idea for PCs, in my opinion. Compared to a variant human, a Star Child has +1 ability score, darkvision, an extra skill skill, and resistance to psychic damage; these seem way better than a feat (even though they are less flexible).  I'd ditch the psychic resistance, but that's just me. Deep Spawn seem underpowered.  Their ability won't help them much unless they're in a whole party of deep spawn, unless they enjoy splitting the party.  I'd give them another bonus. For the Serpent folk, giving them a natural weapon that scales with level doesn't seem reasonable.  I would argue strongly against giving it the light keyword, as well, unless you also specify that they must have a free hand when they use it (which wouldn't make sense).  Otherwise, you'd run into issues with a sword-and-board or a versatile GW character dual wielding with the Dual Wielder feat.  Also, there is no finesse weapon that does d10s of damage, let alone with the light keyword - even if the rules were clarified, the increased damage isn't warranted. For Nasty Crunch, you should probably clarify when the target can make saves.  (At the end of their turn?  Or as an action?) With the Sasaran sub-race, you should clarify what you mean by ""engaging a target within 30 feet of you.""  Would they still be blinded if they fail their save, but then start fleeing? Serpent's Poison feat seems a bit...odd.  As written, a bite with the feat could do an average of 5.5 damage (plus 6.5 once per round) at max level; it's even stronger than a light/finesse greataxe which cannot be disarmed.  Really though, I wouldn't want a player to spend an ASI on keeping their natural weapon viable - if they wanted to do that, I'd work out something in terms of loot.   With regards to the Snake Bite and Serpent's Poison feat, if I were you, I'd change them as follows:  Snake Bite: You are proficient with unarmed strikes using your bite, which deals 1d4 piercing damage on a hit.  Serpent's Poison (Feat):    You gain a +1 bonus to your Constitution. Your unarmed strikes deal an extra 1d4 poison damage (in addition to the 1d4 piercing damage), and they also gain the finesse keyword.  They are considered magical weapons for the purposes of bypassing resistances. You gain resistance to poison and have advantage on saving throws against poison.   I used the same wording as the Aarakocra's Talons for the regular Snake Bite, which I think is more reasonable for an intrinsic weapon.  I think that if you double the damage to 2d4 and give it the finesse keyword, it makes it more reasonable for later use while not making it too out of line.  I think that adding the other two features for that feat make it useful even for people who don't primarily use the bite, or in case they get a snazzy magic weapon."
UnearthedArcana,36jfn7,krispykremeguy,3,Wed May 20 01:56:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for getting back to me!  Both of these were crafted from a mix of /u/JamesMusicus 's fantastic racial guide, as well as tons of input from 2 different 5e homebrew/project groups.  And by all means, the original drafts were a lot more raw.  I'm by all means open to modifying my content, but I also want to give some (probably flawed) reasons for some of the things I might keep or slightly alter from this draft.  The eldritch touched was inspired by the PHB Elf, but trading the sleep abilities, weapon training, and sub-race specific ability for psychic resistance (which hasn't come up too often, unless you're doing a psionic/far realm themed game).  I'm certainly going to get rid of one of the skill bonuses for certain.  As for the ""small or large"" thing, I'll happily get rid of that.  To be fair, there aren't mechanics available for large PCs yet, so I'll let that sit on the back burner.  Also, this was an accidental hold over of my original draft, which was made waaaay before the Goliath was released.  I'll give the Star Child either deception or persuasion, one skill, or axe off the ability as a whole.    As for the deep spawn, I might give them the ability to cast some sort low level spell as a ritual once per short/long rest.  I'll have to look into the PHB/EEPG for something thematic.  I don't want to do aquatic themed weapons, cuz then they'd just be Sahuagin rather than a lovecraftian-inspired creature.  Though, to be honest, I might just axe off deep spawn and have ""Deep One""-esque character just use Sahuagin stats from Tribality's site.  As for the Serpent Folk, there's a tougher nut to crack.    For starters, my reason behind gradual natural weapons was to keep them relevant enough for players.  While I could just have them at a d4 base and cause players to sink one ASI (which would kinda blow), the building natural weapon hasn't been that powerful in my playtests (granted, I didn't have finesse/light properties.  So yeah, I should kill both of those) as the high elf's cantrip can jump in power, as does dragon breath from the dragonborn.  Granted, I'd consider elf to be a step above dragonborn in terms of power.  Perhaps I'm just being thick headed and stubborn about that though, I dunno.  Though, I might give up on the idea, overhauling all of the beast races I made prior to that.  I guess that has yet to be determined.  As for the poisoned save (Nasty Bite), I'd give them at the end of their turn, rather than eating an action.  Also, I might make this an X amount per long rest, though assuming 2 short rests is the norm, this could end up backfiring.  The Sasaran was really unclear.  I might rebuild it, making the light an instantaneous thing for creatures in the burst rather than a large aura.  So, if they're affected, they're blinded (until they succeed a save, also probably at end of turn).  Either that or I'll simply make it last a round before requiring short rest.  Having a small field of blinded opponents for 1 round can still cause quite the advantage.  Now, the feat was a bit of a trouble maker for me.  As it was, I had trouble brainstorming it on the facebook group I post on.  That said, I really like your take on the feat over my original version and I'll certainly update it to fit that.  The new ""racial feat"" is on par with the Svirfneblin feat in the EEPG IMO.  That said, I wouldn't know what to do about specified equipment.  I have 0 - 2 magic items tops in the games I like to run.  Granted, most of my fellow gamers are ""gritty OSR"" (or should I say ""O5R"") types.  Anyway, I'm going to make some adjustments.  As a total newb, I'm not sure if I should make a new thread or simply edit my current one.  Also, pleas pardon the wall of text, I like to ramble when given the chance."
UnearthedArcana,36jfn7,krispykremeguy,3,Wed May 20 04:11:26 2015 UTC,"No worries about the wall of text!  Mine was pretty massive too, haha.  Above all, I don't recommend giving up on any of the races you've posted - you've got a good start here, and I don't think that anything was game-breaking.  I'm coming off of a high-psychic campaign, so I might be thinking that the psychic resistance is more useful than it is.  The large creature bonuses are actually established in the DMG, in the part about making your own monsters.  Assuming that you'd use the same rules for PCs, you would double the damage dice for a large size creature using an appropriately sized weapon (so a large greataxe would deal 2d12 slashing damage on a hit).  Needless to say, that's a bit much, which is why I mentioned it, haha."
UnearthedArcana,36i4hw,wodansring,5,Tue May 19 15:41:29 2015 UTC,Completely immune to sleep and poison is a big deal but so is disadvantage with metal weapons... I am not positive if it evens out but it doesnt seem too unfair.  I am curious how they grow up. Are they born like humans or are they like... Seeds? That grow into little people?
UnearthedArcana,36i4hw,BornToDoStuf,2,Tue May 19 18:50:59 2015 UTC,"Im really not sure if they are even trade-offs.  Hadnt made it that far, but i like the seedling-people idea!"
UnearthedArcana,36i4hw,BornToDoStuf,3,Wed May 20 12:19:19 2015 UTC,I was simply making them a tradeoff in my mind since immunity to anything is quite good.
UnearthedArcana,36i4hw,jwbjerk,2,Wed May 20 16:48:59 2015 UTC,but so is disadvantage with metal weapons.   Cold Iron in DnD is a very specific kind of metal.  Most metal items are not Cold Iron.
UnearthedArcana,36i4hw,krispykremeguy,3,Thu May 21 18:16:34 2015 UTC,"I do like this race, and I think that it seems really fun while not being terribly unbalanced.  That being said, I do think the balance could use a bit of work.  I'd say that Plant Traits seems overpowered, especially if they already have Fey Ancestry.  Besides, herbicides are totally a thing, so I don't see why they'd be immune to poison.  If you disagree, then I'd like more clarification: when you say ""Larces are immune to poison effects,"" do you mean poison damage, the poisoned condition, or both?  Immunity to poison damage seems too good to me.  I'd give them Dwarven/Stout Resilience at best.  I think that ""construct"" is the wrong word choice, but I like the effect.  Can they eat if they're trapped underground?  Do they face dietary restrictions?  I'd like them to be unable to digest meat, but it might be a bit harsh.  I'd change Cold Iron Anathema to include armor made of iron, but that's just me (and once again, might be too harsh).  Also, elaborate a bit more on what they have disadvantage on: attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, all of the above?  No Nature proficiency?  It's a tree person!  At least give them something like the Dwarf's Stonecunning.  I'd make it so that anyone who wants to do a Medicine check on them could instead use Nature, but that's just an idea.  As it is now, it seems like wood elves, only better.  They're 5 ft/turn slower and don't have proficiency with perception, but in exchange have a free cantrip (which is super nice), have immunity to poison, and can move at full pace while sneaking in a forest.  The Larch Natural Construct benefit is also ever-so-slightly better than the Elven Trance, and the Cold Iron Anathema is really easy to get around (especially if you take Shillelagh).  While this is the most overpowered thing ever, I'd consider changing the ability score increase to +1/+1 if you don't nerf it somehow.  And, for anyone else who wants to see the comments on the original post, it's here."
UnearthedArcana,36i4hw,jwbjerk,3,Tue May 19 17:41:46 2015 UTC,"Love the changes Stout Resiliency and Nature Cunning. Also love the Medicine Nature checks.... stealing these  Text for Nat Construct should be Plant Traits. Current text for Plant Traits is covered in the Fey Traits, i agree. Willing to dump immun. to poison (herbicides).  I believe it should not just be disadv with using cold iron, but also wearing it, getting hit by it, etc.  I like your breakdown description.

UnearthedArcana,36fq0e,messy6,3,Tue May 19 01:02:22 2015 UTC,"I've only looked at the battlemind so far, but it looks pretty cool!  It's an interesting paladin re-skin.  I have a few comments:   If you mix Aspect of Elevated Harmony with resistance (like if you had a barbarian in the party, or if you're an Iron Guardian battlemind), it seems like it would get out of hand pretty quickly.  I mean, I know it's a replacement for the Aura of Protection, but if it were me, I'd say that's a bit too much. Psionic Expulsion seems to be too all-encompassing.  Could it be used to remove the effects of an Imprisonment spell? Lightening rush seems on par in terms of damage, but the effect seems overpowered. I think that it'd be more fair to reduce the spell damage to compensate for the fact that you're blocking enemy damage."
UnearthedArcana,36fq0e,krispykremeguy,3,Tue May 19 03:20:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, when i first posted my battlemind there was a lot of backlash about elevated harmony, mainly for what you pointed out, i just cant figure out how to make it different but compete with aura of protection without it becoming OP.

UnearthedArcana,36d4rz,Cthulhusdream,2,Mon May 18 12:58:15 2015 UTC,"Since they have more arms, it would be cool if they could wield more weapons at a time. Maybe they couldn't lift heavier weapons though?"
UnearthedArcana,36d4rz,Cirrus5,2,Mon May 18 15:38:57 2015 UTC,"I wanted to, but being able to quad-wield weapons might make them a bit op. I went with they’re seconds arms are mostly for flavor purposes, maybe holding simple objects or smaller tasks but can’t fight or grapple. But that does give me an idea for a sub races I didn’t think of before….   Maybe there is like a light and a heavy. Light’s get simplified second arms but get flight and maybe some stealth bonuses, Heavy’s get no flight but maybe an additional die when making an attack dual wielding that goes up as they level. Maybe bonuses to grapples or something else hand related lol"
UnearthedArcana,36d4rz,Cirrus5,2,Mon May 18 16:54:47 2015 UTC,Dude flight? That'd be cool
UnearthedArcana,36d4rz,jwbjerk,2,Mon May 18 17:02:19 2015 UTC,Well I had already written them to have it but making 2 sub races it seems that flight would be a good trade off for an extra pair of arms for attacking.

UnearthedArcana,36aeqh,SilentSin26,2,Sun May 17 19:36:10 2015 UTC,I thought it was a bit cleaner than saying it gains infinite pages. It is awkward though.

Nowhere do the rules state that that is an absolute limit on the size of a spellbook.  In fact, the rules state that your spellbook can be basically anything you can write on, including loose leaves that you scrounged together.  Nowhere does it state that the spellbook you can buy is the only spellbook you can have and nowhere does it give a limit on the size of a wizard's spellbook."

UnearthedArcana,361bck,Strangecraft,6,Fri May 15 06:56:04 2015 UTC,"These look quite nice, but I've noticed several things you could improve as I skimmed through:   Fiend Skin -> Fell Blooded: the healing must be no greater than the damage you took. Otherwise you can cut yourself for 1 damage each turn and recover 2 to 6, giving you free healing all day. Master of Masks -> Persona Masks: it doesn't actually say you need to equip the masks or that you can only have one equipped at a time. Its obviously implied, but you should still clearly state such limitations. Master of Masks -> Persona Masks: having masks that say ""your alignment appears to be XX"" means absolutely nothing in 5e because there are no detect alignment spells. Chronomancer -> Quantum Lag: its unclear how this works with area spells like fireball. Does the whole spell fail because a fly or beetle left the area before it triggered? Chronomancer -> Timewalker: rather than saying ""Time stops for you"" which is very mechanically ambiguous, you should just say you're petrified (or stunned)."
UnearthedArcana,361bck,SilentSin26,3,Fri May 15 10:15:03 2015 UTC,"You're right about the Fiend Skin -- I'll edit that right away. Master of Masks' alignment thing is for fluff, it doesn't need to have mechanical effects. Finally, the Timewalker's guts were stolen directly from the time stop spell, after I met some heavy resistance to the original draft. I initially defined it as 'paralyzed' for you initially, and for everyone else when time was stopped, but as I learned, this implied that out Chronomancer could insta-hit auto-crit no-save his spells, as those are the mechanical effects of being paralyzed. So now, this just ostensibly changes the action economy"
UnearthedArcana,361bck,Adraius,2,Fri May 15 16:40:08 2015 UTC,"re: Persona Masks changing alignment, I would still highly recommend changing it to something with a clear mechanical effect, or make it more similar to existing ribbon* features.  In 5th edition, ""choosing your alignment"" is more of a quick way to help players personify their characters; their written alignment is invisible to other players, and you learn about what sort of people other characters are by their actions.  As it stands, the current feature doesn't really make sense and has the potential to prompt rules-lawyering arguments like, ""they don't see my actions as evil, my mask makes it appear to them I'm doing this for the greater good!""  *if you don't know what a ribbon is, see the latest Unearthed Arcana article from WotC.  On the last page it explains what a ribbon class feature is."

UnearthedArcana,35y194,doctornecrotic,4,Thu May 14 17:44:41 2015 UTC,"This is some awesome stuff here.  That said, in a high fantasy D&D world, I would see Eberron/Iron Kingdoms magitech prevailing over the Arcanum-esque magic vs. tech war in the end, but that's just my take on things."
UnearthedArcana,35wfwj,Cenycal,5,Thu May 14 02:04:45 2015 UTC,Reminds me of the Sir Bearington character from this greentext. I love it.
UnearthedArcana,35wfwj,Mitchell777,5,Thu May 14 05:56:58 2015 UTC,"Much better! I saw this is dndnext and made a comment about the lack of a signature racial quality. I love the Bear Claws, and like that they don't infringe upon the Monk's signature ability. Powerful build is also very appropriate.   If for some reason they come out to be too OP when Playtested, my first thoughts would be to reduce their movement speed to 25 (maybe even 20), and remove Darkvision (although it is appropriate)"
UnearthedArcana,35wfwj,bubbaloo2,3,Thu May 14 02:38:58 2015 UTC,I'm most worried about the Bear Claws being their most OP feature but they did need something that made them Bears. Sadly I won't be able to really playtest this soon. It just ended up being a side project will I worked on my upcoming campaign. So I would gladly welcome others to do so and share results.
UnearthedArcana,35wfwj,bubbaloo2,4,Thu May 14 02:43:22 2015 UTC,"Here's how I view them. Every other race does 1 damage with an unarmed strike. By making it 1d4, you're really just giving them a piece of the Tavern Brawler feat. You're not making them Monks by saying they get multiple attacks with their claws or anything like that. I mean, it might be possible to rule that you could Two-Weapon fight with a Shortsword and your claws... but how is that different from Shortsword/Dagger? I don't think it's too OP.  Had you given them a Bite -- that would be OP."
UnearthedArcana,35wfwj,Cirrus5,3,Thu May 14 02:49:00 2015 UTC,This looks awesome! I'm gonna have to use it sometime.
UnearthedArcana,35wfwj,sonofabutch,3,Thu May 14 02:25:29 2015 UTC,"Love it. Some questions:  Do they have opposable thumbs? Can they write? Use all weapons available to their class? Throw weapons? Use bows? Wands?  Given their size, do potions have a lesser effect on them? Can they wear armor? If so, does it have to be custom made?"
UnearthedArcana,35wfwj,Aliuzha,4,Thu May 14 02:55:44 2015 UTC,"They have thumbs. They are bear-like but not necessarily bears. So there are no inhibitions for weapons, writing, etc.  Mechanically speaking they medium creatures so... I'd say no unless you want to make it an issue."
UnearthedArcana,35wfwj,doctornecrotic,2,Thu May 14 03:03:30 2015 UTC,THumbs up! I absolutly like this version better! Congratulations on your determination.

UnearthedArcana,35wfwj,rosyrade,2,Fri May 15 02:24:41 2015 UTC,I'd say they are pretty much smack in the middle of the power range of 5e PHB races.  Nicely balanced!

UnearthedArcana,35ssb3,Galiphile,4,Wed May 13 19:26:31 2015 UTC,"I actually posted a thread on r/dndnext. Most of the feedback said it seemed okay, just some of the items give abilities potentially too early."
UnearthedArcana,35ssb3,Crasnox,3,Wed May 13 22:10:58 2015 UTC,I dont quite understand how you learn new schematics and how that work. I also dont really understand how it works when you change your equipped gadgets.  Could someone please explain it for me? :)
UnearthedArcana,35ssb3,ReillocSW,2,Wed May 20 13:33:14 2015 UTC,"Hi Crasnox!  Engineers learning gadgets basically parallels the way that Wizards learn spells.  At 1st level you know 5 Trivial and 3 Simple gadgets (8 gadget schematics total).    When you advance to 2nd level this increases to 9 schematics total, so you can learn 1 new schematic.  This schematic must be of a level of complexity you can use, so you can chose either 1 Trivial or 1 Simple schematic.  To learn the schematic, you must pay the required gold (10 GP for a Trivial or 50 GP for a simple schematic) and spend the required downtime (1 hour for a Trivial or 2 hours for a Simple schematic).  This simulates paying for the materials you need to build the gadget and the time spent assembling and testing it.  When you level up you can also ""unlearn"" one gadget schematic and replace it with a different schematic that is of a level of complexity you can use."
UnearthedArcana,35ssb3,ReillocSW,2,Wed May 20 16:49:01 2015 UTC,"Changing equipped gadgets, again, is similar to a wizard preparing spells.  At 1st level you know 5 Trivial and 3 Simple schematics.  However, you can only ""equip"" 4 Trivial and 2 Simple gadgets.  So, when you complete a long rest, you must chose which 4 of the 5 Trivial schematics you know will be equipped and which 2 of the 3 Simple gadgets.  You can only use/get the benefit from the effects of the gadgets that you actually have equipped.  Starting at 9th level when you gain the Rapid Reconfiguration trait, you can switch out a limited number of equipped gadgets for other schematics you know whenever you complete a short rest.  I hope that helps."

UnearthedArcana,35ssb3,ReillocSW,2,Wed May 20 17:12:23 2015 UTC,I just released a new revision of the Engineer class over on ENWORLD.  This version adds additional schematics (now well of 100 different gagets!) and suggested archetypes to the class as well making a lot of minor edits for clarity and balance.  Enjoy!

UnearthedArcana,35r6uo,cmyers84,3,Tue May 12 22:24:02 2015 UTC,"The DMG has a small guide and an example, but this guide is pretty extensive and makes it easy to balance. I posted this mostly to share the great catalogue, but since the catalogues point-system is explained in the analysis/guide, and since it is the source, I figured it had to be included."

UnearthedArcana,35q8ww,Smyris,2,Wed May 13 03:45:03 2015 UTC,"While I get that Gems in the show are incredibly resilient, the death mechanics seem pretty over powered, especially at level 18 where you essentially cannot die.  One of the major themes of the show is that Gems are nearly all dead, so it just doesn't jive.  I'd keep the ""retreats to the gem"" mechanic but still force death saves or, if you're dead set on making them nearly invincible, adding levels of exhaustion upon dropping to 0hp (like the gem getting cracked).  Also, the fusion ability is tough to wrap my head around.  To be able to do it you have to be level 15, so if two gems fuse they become a level 30 fighter?  What does that mean??  The way its set up seems to assume multiclassing, which isn't always the case.  I think the ability to fuse would make more sense as a racial ability rather than within the fighter archetype.  Make it sortof a ritual (it requires the dance and, as shown with Steven, is hard to master without some sort of strong emotional driver) that, again, has consequences on the back end - like exhaustion.  I think one of them even made a comment about how they can't fuse all the time because it makes them tired (Pearl maybe?).  Great formatting too, it's obvious you've put some serious time into this.  Overall I like it, it just needs some fine tuning."

UnearthedArcana,35ny58,PotatoeGargler,2,Tue May 12 01:29:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not game to design an entire monster, but I think some sort of bite with a grapple from those flame tendrils could be a good idea for a special ability."
UnearthedArcana,35ny58,Buncs,2,Tue May 12 12:02:49 2015 UTC,"I think you should give ""aspects"" that need to be fullfilled (ex: this monster needs three attacks and a magic ability) because like Buncs I dont know if I am up for creating an entire monster but I wouldnt be adverse to helping with bite sized chunks.  Giving a CR range (or suggestion) would also help if you dont want to limit people like that. Another thing that might help is a link to a guide to creating stat blocks if someone happens to wander through here and wants to help but doesnt know how."
UnearthedArcana,35ny58,BornToDoStuf,2,Tue May 12 13:49:07 2015 UTC,"creating a monster can seem daunting, but in reality the hardest part is the lore.   Stat blocks are easy once you split the workload up a bit, firstly you get a mental image in your head of how you'd envision the creature. Then you figure out the basic attributes. Size, type, etc.  Next you get to work on the base stats, again this is fairly simple if so long as you have an idea of what kind of creature you want. Is your creature an smart but frail thing that uses devious tactics? prioritise it's int score and make it's str and con scores low. Is it a silver tongued Goliath? prioritise cha, str and con. And so on and so on.  Now this is the slightly boring part (imo) working out it's health, speed, strengths, weaknesses, immunities, senses, languages etc. This can take a bit more time than the previous parts, but usually won't be a stress load since a lot of it flows naturally (snow golem is obviously vulnerable to fire damage for example).  With all that out of the way, it's time to get into the nitty gritty of what makes your creature unique. It's passive abilities. These should reflect somewhat on the creature and not just be 'this one looked cool'  type thing. This part you get to really use your imagination and make your creation your own. (eg. a nymph, a being so beautiful that those who gaze upon her become petrified, would have a passive ability that would translate that feature into the game, forcing those who look at her to take a saving throw or be paralyzed for x amount of time)  Once you've had your fun with passives it's time to get down to the actions. again this can be an opportunity to make your monster shine. Actions aren't all simple attacks, they can include things like short range teleports, incredible feats of magic or even just simple unique attacks with effects attached to them (eg. get hit by black hole monster, location hit is utterly destroyed).  With all that done your monster is now pretty much complete! All that's needed now are to fill in any gaps, give the monster a name, and throw together some lore.  I won't lie when I say the lore side of things can be an absolute pain sometimes, but if your vision of the creature is clear in your mind then you should be able to bang out some dot points. Sometimes that's enough, as others can always expand on it, but if you want a more complete picture you can expand on the dot points out to better explain your vision.    the DM guide of course also provides an excellent and comprehensive guide should you need it."
UnearthedArcana,35ny58,Smyris,3,Tue May 12 14:32:20 2015 UTC,"quite a nice little speech, it would work well as a guide if expanded a bit and an example monster added :P  I might see if I can come up with some stuff for this monster, I need some practice with that anyway."
