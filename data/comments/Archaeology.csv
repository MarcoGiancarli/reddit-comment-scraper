Archaeology,3ducs3,superkamiokande,12,Sun Jul 19 15:44:11 2015 UTC,"Not sure about Ur, but as far as Knossos is concerned, a good deal of the reconstruction was based on Arthur Evans' own imagination with no real basis in the archeological record.

Archaeology,3ducs3,TheScion,7,Sun Jul 19 22:01:12 2015 UTC,"For things like this, pure archaeology can only get you so far, which is why there's no such thing as a pure archaeologist.  Once the foundations are uncovered, any surrounding features are mapped, and all the artifacts from the site have been examined, conserved, and catalogued, you're only at the starting point.  After the archaeological process, you should know the size and layout of the building, its age, its cultural association or tradition, its most likely purpose, and what happened to it, among other details about the people who used it.  You can also fill in a lot of details based on the way the building collapsed, like construction methods, how long it took to collapse, how tall it was, and so on.  So now that you have all that information, you take off the archaeologist's hat, put on the historian's, and dive into the historical record.  First, you're looking for any drawing, carving, or textual description of the actual building that you found, or at least similar ones in the same small area.  Then you're looking for the same things except anywhere in the cultural area to which your find belongs.  The accounts of ancient, educated travelers from other places are especially useful if they're available.  You're also reading the research on any similar buildings that have been found before.  So, once you've got all that information gathered - and this has likely taken a couple years, spanning half a dozen dead languages and multiple continents - you take off the historian's hat and replace it with the architect's.  This is how you get the reconstructed drawings of a place.  All of the information gathered so far is collated together and used to produce a model of what the building might have looked like.  Detailed engineering drawings are usually produced if someone is planning to actually rebuild the thing.  That's the basic process as I've seen it carried out, mostly in New World archaeology, but I've followed a few British projects as well and it wasn't substantially different.  The lead archaeologist (the principle investigator) usually has specialists helping him or her at each step of the process, but I've heard of some real crazy people doing it pretty much completely on their own."
Archaeology,3ducs3,Thjoth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:51:27 2015 UTC,"Textual descriptions are especially important. Take for instance the example of Etemenanki, my favorite Ziggurat."
Archaeology,3ducs3,maxpowerer,3,Sun Jul 19 22:04:13 2015 UTC,"How do we know, for example, that there were little towers on top, and how do we know what those would have looked like?   For the specific example of ziqqurats, the interpretations are usually far from certain. As far as I know there are only a few depictions that scholars agree upon that are a reliable representation, the chief one being that of the Marduk ziqqurat of Babylon during the time of Nebuchadnezzar II:  http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/12/30/article-2080375-0F4CF83700000578-747_634x361.jpg  There has never been a temple excavated on top of these even though they are commonly assumed, and three steps is the most that have been found that I am aware of. The rest is extrapolation out of the old theory that the ziqqurati ""evolved"" from the foundation platform of regular temples and eventually more and more steps where added. We have plenty of those temples which are on a raised platform, but otherwise that theory rests on a thin layer of evidence.  Especially with random sources on the internet, those renderings are usually not very professional. The little towers and the 4th step are completely made up in your link.  Another example:   This is the actual plan of the excavation in Tepe Sialk lead by Roman Ghirshman in 1933-1936:  http://i.imgur.com/gmZbpkf.jpg  And this is what you can reasonably deduct from the plan (mockup by myself, I don't vouch for accuracy, there is already some interpolation of missing parts involved):  http://imgur.com/7SZCP2d  The so-called ziqqurat of Tepe Sialk in online reconstructions found in wikipedia (granted, they did have a minor excavation conducted by the Iranian in more recent times where they did find remnants of one ramp in proximity of the structure):  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/SialkCAD.jpg  I think you can judge for yourself. The thing is, some peoples career heavily depend on this being the worlds oldest Ziqqurat. When politics and archaeology mix, bad things happen. /u/Thjoth explained the process it should be, but it's not that often the case with reconstructions. Most of the time reconstructions have nothing to do with the people who excavated the place, and they are often done by people who don't have accurate representation of the most likely case as first priority.  Edit: Spelling and grammar."

Archaeology,3dsr0y,sweetberrywhine,11,Sun Jul 19 10:36:02 2015 UTC,"The topic of owning Native American artifacts is a very sticky one because it brings up questions such as: Where did the artifact in question come from?  What tribe did it belong to?  Was the artifact taken from a burial?  Etc etc.  These are very important things to keep in mind when dealing with museum ownership and buying/selling these items.   The fact that your item does not have any definite origin and you presumably are not looking to sell it, makes it very safe for you to own.  In short, no, I don't think you should be worried about it being taken away from you."
Archaeology,3dsr0y,BasketofHamsters,9,Sun Jul 19 04:18:16 2015 UTC,"A museum or federal agency couldn't legally confiscate that from you as there is no evidence of where it explicitly came from. If they could prove you knowingly took it from federal or tribal lands, you would be subject to penalties under the Archeological Resources Protection Act but sounds like there is no exact context for it so you'll be okay. In lieu of actually going into a museum, you could email a university professor specializing in Mississippian cultures with the same photos you have linked to here."

Archaeology,3dsr0y,kepleronlyknows,2,Sun Jul 19 15:59:43 2015 UTC,"Nope, NAGPRA is not applicable here.  There seems to be a lot of misunderstandings about NAGPRA.    NAGPRA only applies to objects found on federal or tribal land since 1990, or objects in the possession of federal agencies or federally funded ""museums"", although ""museums"" is defined very broadly.    So, even if a federal agency (let alone a private individual) discovers an object, NAGPRA doesn't apply unless it was discovered on federal or tribal land, or it ends up in the possession of the agency or a federally funded institution. See Castro Romero v. Becken, 256 F.3d 349 (5th Cir. 2001), holding that Human remains that were found on municipal land were not protected by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), despite the fact that the United States Army Corps of Engineers, a federal agency, was involved.)"

It could be Spanish gold in the superstition mountains as evidenced by a rock that looks like a conquistador from 10,000 feet in the air, Egyptian gold under 30 meters of Lava near Flagstaff etc. etc.   In this case we have John Ruskamp (a retired chemist and former director of Argonne National Laboratory) with his book ""Asiatic Echoes""  In the text, Ruskamp abuses the Jacquard index of similarity to ""measure"" the similarity of Native American rock art to Chinese ideograms. His methods of categorization of rock carving features do not seem to be repeatable.  Worse still, Ruskamp does not consult with anyone who has any expertise in the rock art of the American Southwest. Well studied glyphs that predate the supposed Chinese trading junks are attributed to Chinese origins.

Archaeology,3daw3y,shrimpcreole,9,Tue Jul 14 21:57:25 2015 UTC,"If it's open on the bottom, it's almost certainly some kind of ferrule.  The rectangular hole looks like it's meant to accommodate a strap, which could be metal or leather.  It's a little bit like these umbrella parts.  A bell clapper doesn't seem quite right, the string would coming through the side right where it would strike the bell, which would lead to it wearing out really fast.  I've also seen somewhat similar parts on horse collars and carriages in places where wooden pieces connect to leather, but not exactly like this.    edit: here's a picture of a corn flail with a similar ferrule.  I think OP's might be a little light for use on a flail, but i think it was probably used in some similar ""attach a stick to something else"" situation.  Edit 2: It's very much like the ferrule from a dust mop handle. It might even be one.  There have been countless designs, this might be an old one."
Archaeology,3daw3y,blueandroid,2,Wed Jul 15 01:45:46 2015 UTC,The part on the bell clapper often hangs below the rim of the bell previously to avoid that issue.  Someone posted a very illustrative picture on my earlier comment.
Archaeology,3daw3y,Watcher13,3,Wed Jul 15 03:47:30 2015 UTC,"I agree it's possible, but I think it's unlikely.  A rectangular eye on the top of a clapper will keep it from swinging as freely in all directions.  Being hollow makes it more difficult to manufacture for no gain.  The bottom eye is usually approximately centered below the knob, so it doesn't try to twist the clapper as someone rings the bell.  There is usually a knob. On the other hand, a ferrule on a staff, rail, or tool has to be hollow, usually has a hole in the side near the edge for a nail or screw, and is usually tapered just like this so it can be driven on for a tight fit."

If not found with artifacts, it can be hard to tell who the remains belong to. It could be a homesteader or pioneer, it could be a soldier or a Native American. Sometimes human craniums end up as great granddaddy's mantelpiece, other times the police are called and the remains are looked at by a forensic specialist. If determined to not be a homicide victim or a recently deceased person, they are usually sent to be housed in a facility at a museum or university federal repository (like the one I work in). From there, further analysis will be done, and it may become a NAGPRA case where it must be determined whether the remains belong to a Native person, in which case it will be repatriated and either remained housed by the repository at the request of the tribe, or they may choose to ceremoniously reinter or cremate the remains."

We're more well-versed in our 'recent' history vs. the history of a civilization long past.  But anyway, yeah. Stuff like this is found pretty regularly. In Arizona (and I'm sure other states as well) any time a building project is conducted a survey has to be done and any objects or remains found are sent to a state repository/museum where they are cataloged and stored (or referred to NAGPRA cases where appropriate)."

Remains found on state owned public land are not within the realm of NAGPRA unless possibly they were discovered in conjunction with a federally funded institution. But even then case law I've seen indicates those artifacts would not immediately be within NAGPRA."

Archaeology,3d55n0,sunset_blues,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:15:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's confusing with ARPA, NAGPRA, and NHPA all overlapping.  It helps that I'm currently in a law firm working on a NAGPRA issue."
Archaeology,3d55n0,kepleronlyknows,2,Mon Jul 13 20:21:27 2015 UTC,"I work at a federal repository, we just had an ARPA case recently and are currently on a NAGPRA case! I should know better."
Archaeology,3d55n0,sunset_blues,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:07:39 2015 UTC,"True, I was only talking about the land requirement, as was the person I was replying to, not the federal nexus aspect."
Archaeology,3d55n0,kepleronlyknows,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:24:27 2015 UTC,"Although as I said, even instances of remains discovered on state owned land by federally funded projects doesn't  automatically fall under NAGPRA. The federal funding aspect arises when ""museums"" receive federal funding.  NAGPRA has a very broad definition of museum, however, and essentially any institution or state or local agency fits the museum definition if it maintains possession of remains or certain artifacts and receives federal funding."
Archaeology,3d55n0,kepleronlyknows,2,Tue Jul 14 23:40:40 2015 UTC,"out of curiosity, what sort of place do you work at? I'm looking for work with skeletal remains (as it's what I've been studying) and I know the opportunity is kind of limited."
Archaeology,3d55n0,ondrurylane,2,Tue Jul 14 23:51:12 2015 UTC,"I work at an archaeological repository, one of three in my state, located in a museum on a university campus. Aside from regular staff, we have 20+ student interns who are paid through the university's work study program or by grants acquired by the museum's various departments. Generally people get in by just expressing an interest, submitting a CV, and sort of hounding us for a while until there's an opening. Sometimes they are referred by professors or staff.  I was given this advice as an undergrad, and it has never let me down: if you hang around the department enough, they will ALWAYS find something for you to do."
Archaeology,3d55n0,sunset_blues,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:09:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you all for the answers! It's too bad we don't hear more about the finds when they occur. If I'm following correctly, in most states it is up to the private land owner to notify the officials that he has uncovered something. Something they may not elect to do since it would call for an excavation on their property. Does the US not have any antiquities or archaeological laws like some other nations have? I know they have laws regarding Native remains but are their laws regarding the discovery of non-native settlers? It seems like a crime against history for a major discovery to end up on great grandpa's mantle."

Archaeology,3d0hdz,agmejiar1994,8,Sun Jul 12 23:23:55 2015 UTC,"'corn' is the native English word for 'grain', British English still uses it this way. 'Corn' according to Americans is short for 'Indian corn', literally ""grain of the Indians"", which is called 'maize' elsewhere."
Archaeology,3d0hdz,wurrukatte,2,Mon Jul 13 01:54:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly - hence the lovely post-mediaeval corn-drying kilns found all over northern Scotland, which were used for drying barley."

Calfskin leather covers the boards.  Gold leaf graces the designs on the cover.  The smell of newly printed paper perfumes the air as he opens it.  He carefully turns to the first page with its illuminated first capital, tears out the page and eats it.  This is how these opponents of the Antiquities Act appear to me.

Can anyone help me find out the original author?)"

Archaeology,3ctupc,Idrimi87,6,Fri Jul 10 18:57:07 2015 UTC,"No harm in trying to contact your old professors, you never know! You have a field school or some excavation experience of some kind, which is better than some people."
Archaeology,3ctupc,archsci,7,Fri Jul 10 23:10:02 2015 UTC,"Start searching your area for volunteer positions, both at museums and historical/archaeological societies. Find volunteer work with archaeologists. Work in the field for a year or so and use them as references to apply to grad school or field work jobs. I would recommend grad school. Know that you may have to apply a few times to grad school, that's normal.   What type of archaeology are you into? Did you study with Fred Kleiner at BU? He's my hero."
Archaeology,3ctupc,paperandcloth,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:32:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll try looking for something like that. I did try to see if my state's archaeologist might know of some opportunities, but that fell through.  Nope, unfortunately I never had a class with Dr. Kleiner. I did my field school in Spain, and excavated one summer in Syria at Tell es-Sweyhat. I took several Geoarchaeology courses, and I always enjoyed ANE stuff as well."

Archaeology,3ctupc,Possum_Pendulum,3,Wed Jul 15 00:46:43 2015 UTC,"It is definitely possible.  Don't listen to the negative comments in this thread.  It will take work, but if you are willing to put it in, you should be able to get into a program.  The key for this year is to get as much on-paper experience as possible so you can display a willingness to reengage with the field.    One of the most important things to do would be to volunteer on an excavation or at a local museum.  Are there any excavations within an hour drive where you could volunteer (if you have transportation)?  Having a little recent excavation experience on your application goes a long way.  If there is a college or university nearby, you could also volunteer in an archaeology lab.  You will likely do a lot of labeling and cleaning, but it would be great on your resume when you apply to schools.  I would also recommend writing something new that you will be able to submit with applications.  Or rewrite a writing assignment from your BA to make it graduate school level.  being this far away from your BA, committees will expect you to already be writing at the masters level.  If you would like any proofreaders, I would be happy to help.  Creating a new writing sample will show departments that you are actively reacclimatizing yourself with the field.   Lastly, reach out to professors you are interested in working with.  Explain your situation and be honest.  They will give you advice about how best to prepare yourself to apply for their programs.  You could start this part of the process today.  Feel free to PM me if you have any questions or want to talk anything over.  Good luck!  Edit:  Also, GRE scores are only valid for five years (I believe).  You will need time to study for and to retake the exam, depending on how seriously the departments to which you apply consider GRE scores.  Having a high GRE score in your situation could set you apart."
