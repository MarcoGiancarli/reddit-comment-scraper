Like comparing my dual xeon x5570 setup (slightly newer more efficient processors) it still uses 250 watts at idle, compared to 60 watts for an i3 processor. Still, for a homelab or for free, they are fine."
iiiiiiitttttttttttt,3dxxms,stealthgerbil,11,Mon Jul 20 20:59:10 2015 UTC,"Criteria for homelab servers (2015):  Can it run esxi/hyperv server/Citrix/ virtualbox? (In order of preference)  Does it have at least 32gigs of ram? (64 or more preferred)  Does it have room for raid 10? (Mirroring only will work in a pinch)  That should be good to get a starter lab with some clients and a good stack of virtual networking and domain. Possibly even something decent sized like an sccm virtual lab.  EDIT: Yes KVM and Xen and whatever else you want to use for a Hypervisor, but as a friendly fyi: in ALL cases of homelabs I've seen in real life (nice setups) it's been mainly hyper-v server or ESXi (and some ghetto-awesome virtualbox setups). Feel free to run whatever floats your boat."

Clickable wheels in particular; I use Linux and the default copy-paste mechanism uses the middle mouse button to paste, which maps very nicely to a clicky mouse wheel.

iiiiiiitttttttttttt,3dfowf,geraldsummers,2,Fri Jul 17 04:35:27 2015 UTC,"At least you admit it. I also kind of went off: People who claim ""Linux is just the command line"" or similar are, to me, a rather low kind of elitist, the people who know a little bit and lord it over others.  Linux was command-line only in the early days not out of desire, but necessity. It took work to get the kernel and the surrounding software to the point it could support the dominant X codebase (XFree86, I think it was. X.Org came well after Linux was established.). When those things began to happen, and it all began to come together, distros happened fairly quickly; I think both Slackware and Debian are about two decades old now, and they weren't the first. My point is, Linux has always been used metonymically to refer to complete systems built around Linux and trying to change it is arrogant.  At least you aren't one of those people who insists on ""GNU/Linux"" to the exclusion of all else. The worst of it is, I can see where they're coming from: Without GNU, Linux wouldn't be where it is today, but there are still a lot of important pieces which are non-GNU, X being one of them, and focusing too much on the GNU part ignores the work of those people."
iiiiiiitttttttttttt,3dfowf,derleth,2,Fri Jul 17 04:45:33 2015 UTC,"Linux is a good term when addressing general prospects about the OS but leaves much to be desired when trying to be specific. I will reuse my point about the middle mouse text paster, which I was quite incorrect about and is actually a feature of X, which could, I suppose, be considered the default graphics server. But with alternate graphics servers gaining popularity (i.e. wayland) the notion of a ""default"" property of Linux I feel is a bit naive beyond kernel modules like systemd, ALSA etc.  Don't get me wrong, I'm still going to refer to my OS as Linux, I'm just going to call it Arch Linux. Or Ubuntu, or Fedora Core. Semantics are important, especially in the computer industry."

When you say, hey Joe, I put on an antivirus software on %timestamp from windows install logs% and I saw it was uninstalled on %timestamp from windows install logs% they're going to get defensive. Be ready and just be a nice guy. Just say something like.    Joe, this program is called ""antivirus."" It protects you from viruses."
iiiiiiitttttttttttt,3cypcp,gordonv,3,Sun Jul 12 15:36:47 2015 UTC,"My old company didn't have proper IT.  They only offlined 3 XP desktops a few weeks ago.  The current setup is still running HP shitwear on most of the machines.  It is an industrial electronics company.  The lack of IT knowledge was astonishing.  Last consult I did was honest to god explain how NFC was NOT the newest form of government spying.  Finally got that through to an ENGINEER, he paused for a second, then asked me straight faced, ""So if they don't spy that way, then how do they spy on me?"". I thought for a second, mostly hoping he would crack a smile...  Then said, "" the same way they have for 40 years.  The Mic and Wireless radio integral to the phone"".  Turned, and walked away, before he could say anything else.  Most of the recent IT work was done by a contracted accountant, and a highschool intern.  My PC was the only one I felt semi-secure using.  We have hundreds of files from our customers backed up.  Totalling a few dozen gigs.  Most of these critical files are a few dozen K/M.  Hundreds of license files, and all kinds of shit on a server, that is basically protected by a 7 character password.  Shit, this should be a rant in /r/sysadmin..."
iiiiiiitttttttttttt,3cypcp,PaleFlyer,2,Sun Jul 12 08:46:31 2015 UTC,"I use to be an IT guy for such a company. You are right. When I got in at 2010 everyone was on XP, No antivirus, problems everywhere.  They were on Google Apps for Business/GMail which was a great move.    Sadly, the owner (who is cost over results) hired a CFO and the CFO fired me and 8 other people. (Different departments)    Now I hear things are falling apart and pretty much going back to the way they were before me. People are mad / sad. One engineer quit because of it, which surprised me. Had directors stand up for me. But the CFO was an ass.    :( I still miss a lot of people there, but got a new job that pays more. ""Nothing is more permanent then change"" right?"
iiiiiiitttttttttttt,3cypcp,gordonv,2,Sun Jul 12 15:59:16 2015 UTC,"I got a better offer.  The ""controller"" actually said the owner fucked up in losing me.  But we actually had some AV on the old machines.  The current machines are mostly running Windows antivirus.  They also have some HP shit that blocks flash drives.  No one knew about this until the PC's arrived.  That lasted exactly 6 minutes on my PC, and 5 on the other computer guy.  I pulled it off 2 other guys computers.  And I was slowly finding reasons to install proper things on the PC's."

For the most part, the IT policy was self managed, and they can't lock it down much, as the techs need to be able to download manuals, and often software.  And they aren't given the time to wait for a PC to be shipped off to a mythical IT person, to have the software installed.  I have talked to customers, who hired us, as trying to get their in-house to install the RIGHT software, correct, in 3 tries was a miracle.  and usually took at least a month.  Took me about 3x as long as the download, as the installers are all slow shit."

If the user said, ""check back in 4 days,"" we still had to confirm with them every day that they wanted us to check back in 4 days - otherwise we'd get shit for it at team status meetings. Every single ticket had to be updated every day, even if it was just LVM (left voicemail), or ""customer is still on vacation"".  That manager infuriated me."
