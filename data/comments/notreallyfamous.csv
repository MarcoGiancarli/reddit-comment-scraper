Several years ago, around 04 or 05, I saw an article in the paper about a guy I went to high school with. He was a pretty big guy, and he decided he could pass for a football player. He used his confidence to gain access to some VIP areas, and stole a bunch of memorabilia. Tens of thousands of dollars worth of rare merch, just by pretending he belonged there.  He got caught, but I don't remember how."

Later on when I got into a more intellectual phase I was into some kind of asceticism and justified the lack of needing to cut my hair as being part of a minimalist lifestyle. When I went to college somehow it suddenly struck me that most of the world didn't see me the way I was seeing myself with long hair, and I was basically cock-blocking myself.

He was a local regular around town and I commented to her that every time I saw him I always thought he looked like Will Ferrell so she decided to ask him for a picture. After this pic was taken she posted it on her Instagram saying that it actually was Will. A few minutes later everyone's phones started blowing up with people wanting to know if it was true that he was there and people were even calling the restaurant asking if he was there. The owner just replied that yes it was true but they'd have to just come in there because they didn't like to talk about the celebrities that came in sometimes. So for the next few hours bewildered packs of sorority girls would come running in the door looking around for ""Will"" who had left shortly after the pic was taken."

The two super star writers that I really know of who wrote some of their best content were Dan Gurewitch and Sarah Schneider, both of who are no longer with the company. Dan is a writer for John Oliver's show now and Sarah Schneider is a writer for SNL, so they both went on to greater and better things. All my favorite regular actors from that golden era of Collegehumor are gone, with the only real remaining member being Pat Cassels and maybe Murph.

notreallyfamous,2n6th4,helpful_hank,16,Sun Nov 23 19:31:59 2014 UTC,"One year in high school for my biographical research topic in english class, I was stumped who to choose. I decided Muhammad Ali should be interesting.  And, I became a fan of Muhammad Ali for life. No one was as enthusiastic about their project as I was. Every day, doing the research was dynamite.  One article I found mentioned with regard to Ali vs. Foreman in Zaire that Ali's fame was such that people would go to villages with no electricity, no plumbing, not a single television or radio, and there hanging on the wall in a hut would be a picture of Muhammad Ali.  And there's a lot of stuff like this:  Melvin “Doc” Stanley (New York City-based print and radio media): “Muhammad Ali, wow. Ali has always been so very special to me for a multitude of unique reasons. Greatest fighter, athlete of our lifetime. Only Pele can be mentioned in the same breath as an international and global figure, both men the most renowned athletes of our generation and quite possible of all times. And in a time where their world wide fame was produced with a fraction of the media methods, tools and outlets that are used today. Word and mouth were major factors, living legends truly befit them both. Ali was both a student of the sweet science and knew its history and the legends and stars that preceded him. They may have said, ‘Screw Babe Ruth,’ during the World War, but nobody knew or heard of the Babe in a Brazil, Suriname, Aruba, Egypt, or a hut in South Africa or a village in Zaire. Ali and Pele can lay claim to such and although they shouted Ruth’s name during the war, only Ali and Pele had wars stopped to see them both perform.”"

Drinking in an unexpected place/time surprises your body making your feel more drunk.

Born in Ladera Heights, he rose to prominence as the leader and co-founder of the alternative hip hop collective Odd Future, and has rapped on and produced songs for nearly every Odd Future release.  Okonma also creates all the artwork for the group's releases  and said in an interview with radio presenter DJ Semtex, that he designs all the group's clothing and other merchandise as well.  After releasing his debut album Goblin under XL Recordings, in April 2011, he signed a joint venture deal for him and his label Odd Future Records, with RED Distribution and Sony Music Entertainment.  Following that he released his second studio album Wolf, which was met with generally positive reviews and debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 selling 90,000 copies in its first week.

(Having videos, gifs, audio, etc of girls, and pretending to be them, then getting guys to send you money.)  I wanted to see how easy it was, and how well it would work, so I tried it out a couple times.  What you just described? Fuckin' child's play. I'd bet the video you were seeing was a fairly low frame rate, dim lights, and low resolution.  Am I wrong?  Low frame rates, dim lights and low resolution means if you merge clips, it's not gonna look like anything changed. The frame rate is low enough that you're not gonna pay attention to their hand jumping across the sreen, the lights in the background are going to be fairly even amongst all the clips, and the low resolution keeps you from noticing details like a ring coming off, or their hair suddenly moving in weird ways.  If you're on a site like omegle, and you see a girl, and she doesn't talk, she's fake. Ask her to put a finger up, two fingers up, spin around, jump up and down, clap her hands, whatever you want. Wouldn't even matter at all, that's all really easy to fake."

notreallyfamous,2n1vuy,SloppySynapses,24,Sat Nov 22 12:13:37 2014 UTC,"Yeah. People definitely do. They're called virtual cam whore packs. VCW's.   There's a bunch of free ones out there, but they're generally pretty shitty. You'll get some clapping, standing, counting on your fingers, talking, typing and maybe an AFK clip, along with some junky merge clips.   Generally, they come with about a hundred pictures of the girl as well, and you'd sell those pictures to the sucker that wants to buy them.  If you pay for a pack, you get significantly more out of it. In some forums, people will sell packs with many many more clips that you can use.   You'd have a couple hundred clips as a professional, definitely.  Many clips for different fingers being held up. Spinning around, flicking your hair, AFK clips, strip teases, clapping your hands, jumping up and down.  After some time, the packs the pro's use get over-used, and spread, and people start to recognize the girl too much. Then they get leaked, and those are the packs you'll find for free.  300 clips would be pretty high, really. But somewhere between 100 and 300 feels pretty average for a good VCW, definitely."

notreallyfamous,2n1vuy,calebspittman,13,Sun Nov 23 23:37:49 2014 UTC,"It really depends on how much you want to make.  Some people do it for emergency money. If they need $500 by tomorrow, they can get it.  Others do it for spending money, and they'll work a few days a week, making about $1000 / week.  Others do it because they have fun doing it. Whether they have fun ripping off idiots, or have fun seeing the massive number in their bank account. These guys will make anywhere from $100K-$300K every year.  These are of course experienced people. As far as I've seen, the average for beginners is about $1000-$2000/month. As you get better at it, you'll learn some better ways to get the guys to send you money, and you'll get better at managing more conversations at the same time.

notreallyfamous,2n26b6,AlexKralie,1 point,Sun Nov 23 19:16:05 2014 UTC,"Bret Hart:       Bret Hart (born July 2, 1957) is a writer, actor and retired professional wrestler. A member of the Hart wrestling family and a second-generation wrestler, he has an amateur wrestling background, wrestling at Ernest Manning High School and Mount Royal College. Along with his nickname ""The Hitman"", Hart was known by the monikers ""The Excellence of Execution"", ""The Best There Is, The Best There Was and The Best There Ever Will Be"" and ""The Pink and Black Attack"".  Hart joined his father Stu Hart's promotion Stampede Wrestling in 1976, and made his in-ring debut in 1978.  He gained popularity and championship success throughout the 1980s and 1990s in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), where he helmed The Hart Foundation faction. He left for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) following the controversial ""Montreal Screwjob"" in November 1997, where he remained until October 2000. Having been inactive from in-ring competition since January 2000, owing to a December 1999 concussion, he officially retired in October 2000, shortly after his departure from the company. In a publication that year, WCW described Hart as ""universally respected by other wrestlers"", and ""perhaps the greatest pure wrestler ever to lace up a pair of boots.""   He returned to sporadic in-ring competition in 2004 and 2006, and in 2010 with WWE, where he won his final championship, headlined that year's SummerSlam event, and served as the General Manager of Raw. He makes occasional appearances for WWE, who has described him as both an ""innovator of offense"" and ""arguably the greatest technical wrestler in WWE history.""  The promotion has also described Hart as one of the biggest names in the history of the business,   and perhaps the most popular in the world by the mid-1990s.  He headlined WrestleManias IX, X and XII, and participated in the headlining matches of the 1997 and 1999 editions of WCW Starrcade - as a special enforcer in the former.
