You'd spend money on the lawsuit you wouldn't get back because either they'd win for fun if you didn't take the settlement for a new charger and maybe a new laptop if it was damaged. But if it was an official charger, the mature adult thing to do would just be to contact them and they'll give you all sorts of shit for free no questions asked. Apple's policy on broken/faulty products is unparalleled. You can not like them all you want, but there's no Samsung store that will just give you a brand new phone if a mere button is stuck on your current phone. Especially when there's a safety issue, they go above and beyond. Long after iPod nano G1 was off the market, a few stories of fire hazards got them to take in any G1, working or not working, and they gave you a brand new nano G5.   Odds are, this actually isn't an official power adapter, or debris got into the gap between contacts and shorted it out. But if it's legit, OP just go to your nearest Apple Store or call them and they'll make it right."

techsupportgore,3dys3q,timmeh87,117,Mon Jul 20 17:30:32 2015 UTC,And is asking to check the hard drive because the computer is obviously damaged in other ways and recovering data from it would probably be important.
techsupportgore,3dys3q,John-Mc,74,Mon Jul 20 20:26:02 2015 UTC,"True story: When I left my last job as a bench tech supervisor, I mandated we test the platter integrity for anything checked in with physical damages with cursory testing, 1st thing before we address the issue on the ticket. I got balled out by my boss for checking hard drives when the screen is broken. I then thew an excel spreadsheet showing 3 years of data (yes he waited 3 years to address it) that 60% of screen repairs  ended up requiring a pro-active hard drive replacement that we caught early before it became a data-loss event and I actually boosted sales and service. It was a negligible thing to do. We pop a disc in and let the system sit and scan while we work other systems so it's not like we were sitting around twiddling thumbs, I increased bench throughput by 3X over the last supervisor and we have a better system repair accuracy in diagnostics. When I came in, sales/service from bench techs went from $29,000 a year to $250, 000 a year and under my watch, the owner got to take the first 2 cruises on cruise ships since the business's inception in 2005.  I then did the same thing for ALL systems and we caught an additional 20% drive failure rate for non physical damages. Guess what that equated? More money and less time trying to repair a broken drive issue. They told me to just ""address the problem description"" and not check the hard drive unless it's making noise. I walked a few weeks later. Short-sighted assholes."
techsupportgore,3dys3q,burythepower,26,Mon Jul 20 23:41:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for doing this. I had a laptop I took in for battery issues and the tech handed it back, told me the mother board and HDD were fucked and I should back up my data asap. I knew it was acting squirrelly but I had no idea the HDD was failing, figured it was just old. That tech basically saved my junior year of college for me, as I was able to get my stuff off and onto a new laptop before it died during finals. Oh, and they didn't charge me, which was nice.   In short, I appreciate you and, should I ever fully launch a career in IT, I will implement this policy."
techsupportgore,3dys3q,icecreampuddle,12,Tue Jul 21 03:13:28 2015 UTC,Thanks man. That reply really meant a lot to me.
techsupportgore,3dys3q,burythepower,9,Tue Jul 21 03:16:43 2015 UTC,"Beautiful. I do almost the same thing, systems with damage get some sort of integrity check and all systems get smart data checked.  So few people to proper backups no matter how much they know they should, I might as well do what I can and it's payed off enough that i've made extra money and my clients have had fewer catastrophic failures."
techsupportgore,3dys3q,John-Mc,5,Tue Jul 21 00:07:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Gotta pass the hardware integrity before we move on to the problem description. I don't know how many times techs would beat their heads up against the wall for DAYS before I suggest they do a platter check and BOOM, there's your problem, data loss.

techsupportgore,3dym97,chubbysumo,3,Mon Jul 20 17:42:08 2015 UTC,"The ""Blanco Hardware Information Report"" was left on the drives by the software they used to wipe the hard drive. I would never known if I didn't forget to put the Windows Setup USB in the computer.   Besides the ""Frustration Free Packaging"", the drives were in a professionally looking sealed static bag. I didn't look to close at the first drive before I installed it, because I assumed it to be new. Nothing had made me think it wasn't new. From the product description to the final packaging, nothing really threw any red flags.  That is until I installed the hard drive and forgot to put the setup media in the drive when I turned on the laptop. The white Blanco screen popped up and I was slightly confused at first. The specs were not from the machine I was working on. I was working on a Toshiba and the specs were from a Dell. Further investigation and Googling led me to find out that this drive used before.  For the hell of it I booted up HDAT2 and found that the drive is in good condition and shows no SMART warnings, but it was definitely used.  I've issued a return with Amazon for both drives and have them packed up to ship out. I will have a hard time trusting Amazon in the future for similar purchases. I have never had this problem with previous purchases, but then again, this is the first time that I've bought a hard drive through Amazon.   If the description said the item was Refurbished, and I was okay with that, then that'd be okay. The description of the product is misleading by omitting the fact that the drives had been previously used. I think 99% of people would never notice, and that's obvious from the reviews. Then again, Amazon likes to mix the reviews from different sellers in to the main product listing page. So you never really know what you're going to get, and in what condition you're going to get it in.  I guess the lesson learned is to buy only buy items that are SOLD, and Shipped by Amazon. But after this I don't think I want to purchase anything from Amazon. I guess it will be NewEgg or the local store for new hardware purchases. Any suggestions for other online computer hardware stores? (Hopefully ones that actually sell Brand-New equipment.)  tl;dr: Description left out fact that drive is refurbished. Amazon mixes reviews from different sellers. Shipped by Amazon, sold by another company. I no longer trust in Amazon to deliver New, when I buy New."

techsupportgore,3dym97,jacle2210,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:29:42 2015 UTC,"there is no average number for a used drive.

My laptop HDD has about 5000 hours on it(bought in 2008), and my servers HDDs have about 5000 hours each.  they were all bought used, with about that much on them, and I bought all those earlier this year.  There is no such thing as average hours, as my wifes laptop HDD has 15000 hours on it, and its only from 2011.  If the hours are more than 1, its not new.

All Amazon does it to process your payment and tells the seller what was sold and who to ship to.  Amazon has nothing to do with how the seller lists their item. Also Amazon does not directly sell used items or refurbished items; they only allow 3rd party sellers to do this  Purchasing items directly from Amazon should be a very safe process and should there be a problem they will do everything they can to fix the issue (assuming you fall in the scope of what they are allowed to do).

You can get non macs with good build quality, but they too will cost more. You can find a wide range of build quality when it comes to non macs, it depends on how much you are willing to pay.

All you end up with is something that costs a hell of a lot more and is worse for the environment by a large margin and for what? It looks nice for a few years before you discard it for a new model?  The one failing of traditional PCs is their model development is so competitive and short term that they are not as well thought out, but often the better business models are a lot better like the latitude, seen that thing stand up to things that would demolish a macbook.

techsupportgore,3ds4ge,Threedawg,19,Sun Jul 19 15:42:24 2015 UTC,"In some ways yes. Superb suspension design, for example, and mechanically most things are good to excellent. However, BMW has a decades long history of not only denying the existence of endemic problems, but shifting blame onto customers.  For example, BMW's N14 engine used in the 2007-2010 MINI Cooper S is prone to timing chain failure due to a poor tensioner design, which itself manifests when oil gets low. That engine tends to consume oil, and BMW specified 15,000mi oil change intervals. The oil (full synthetic) can take the mileage, but if the level drops, the tensioner loses tension, the timing chain starts slapping and breaks its guide rails a bit at a time (which are made of plastic, inside a hot engine; nice call BMW), and eventually the engine loses timing and Mr Piston Head meets Mssrs Valve. Hilarity ensues.  If it happens in warranty BMW has to fix it, but once you pass 50,000, it's all ""you let the oil level drop too low"" and ""consuming a quart per 1000 miles is normal"".  A decade earlier, a bunch of M3 or M5 engines (I forget which as I wasn't persona not affected) were denied warranty coverage for engine failure because the engine computer reported they were run past redline. Even when they had not been. (I'm certain some were, but the ultra performance M-series cars sell to wealthy car nuts, the kind of people who take good care of their cars.)  Anyway, those are two examples of ""your fault for triggering our flawed design"" at BMW. The parallels to Apple's cable design should be quite clear. :-/"

I've had one since 2011 and pretty much charge the thing every day and never had one break like pictured.

I've dealt with well over a thousand chargers in mac 1:1 deployments, and I've seen maybe 20 with that type of failure.  We're talking chargers that are in our fleet 4+ years.  It hasn't been catastrophic from our end.  And this is with grade 5-12 students who don't always treat their equipment with the utmost respect."
techsupportgore,3ds4ge,zealeus,5,Sun Jul 19 01:50:10 2015 UTC,"I've only broken two non-apple chargers.  One, my laptop charger I tripped over so hard it yanked my computer off the table violently enough for it to emergency stop the hard drive, and the other being the charger for my nexus 7, which had the plug itself fail after about a year.  The $10 replacement charger for that laptop lasted me another 2 years before I retired that laptop entirely for being a gigantic piece of shit that wasn't worth the $200.  Meanwhile, I have used about an equivalent amount of apple chargers, if not more, and all the laptop chargers had had the problem in this post, although not quite as severe (usually).  This includes my old (used) iBook G4, which actually ripped in two soon after purchase, and my mom's Macbook Pro, which currently has a layer of silicone over the damaged connector.  In addition, most of the ipod chargers have only just lasted long enough to be replaced, with all of them coming close to splitting where they attach to the 30-pin/lightning connector, as well as the USB end.  However, that's just my experience, but in general I have noticed the best quality chargers from my motorola phones and from my chromebook.  No issues with these, and the cables seem pretty high-quality.  Both have survived living in my backpack with multiple binders for the last year, so I guess that counts for something."

Then, fold the 2 wires 2 times and then make a nice overhand knot out of it. I've quickly set up an example here (although done with a significantly better engineered Lenovo charger, it can be applied to Apple chargers as well): http://i.imgur.com/hXNH3ix.jpg Note: the knot will look much better when done with an Apple charger, because its wires are easier to handle.

techsupportgore,3dpkpi,smeenz,16,Sat Jul 18 11:59:36 2015 UTC,Except that's two different bundles. Looks like a 25 pair on the left and a 50 on the right.
techsupportgore,3dpkpi,Ace417,16,Sat Jul 18 12:52:45 2015 UTC,"The 50 was probably cut in two places, and they used the 25 pair to fix it"
techsupportgore,3dpkpi,smeenz,14,Sat Jul 18 12:57:53 2015 UTC,"100% this. I'm betting that there used to be a 110 block there for the phones there, and when the dealership went voip they got a little gung ho tearing it out. Source: have seen it done before, got paid to fix it with not scotch locks."
techsupportgore,3dpkpi,kryptorofthecloset,2,Sat Jul 18 15:02:24 2015 UTC,"110 blocks are for ethernet, you are thinking of a 66 block."
techsupportgore,3dpkpi,RaverDrew,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:54:27 2015 UTC,"Not really trying to start an internet argument here, but 110 blocks are just as much for telco, as a 66 block realistically the 110 has replaced the 66."
techsupportgore,3dpkpi,kryptorofthecloset,0,Sun Jul 19 03:21:20 2015 UTC,"I am not sure I understand what you are saying, but 110 blocks and 66 blocks have totally different purposes, require different tools, and truthfully have their own places. One of the biggest is the ability to remove a bridge clip for a 66 block, allowing you to isolate issues to either the demarc, or something internal, or a 66 block's ability to have more than one wire on a single punchdown, unlike a 110 block. That isn't to say a 110 block can't be used in place of a 66 block, but they aren't exactly interchangable."

techsupportgore,3dpkpi,excoriator,23,Sat Jul 18 18:14:46 2015 UTC,Lol @ fax over voip. It's like starting a Skype session so that you can make Morse code noises to the other person.
