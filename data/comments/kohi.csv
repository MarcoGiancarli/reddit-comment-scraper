kohi,3e4wtr,CritiqMC,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:37:32 2015 UTC,for a unban its fair becuase you probably got perma banned SO you will pay the money if you really are sorry for what you did and want to play again

kohi,3e4wtr,Hawtre,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:21:23 2015 UTC,If you're playing Minecraft you can afford $15 you niggas ain't homeless or some shit.
kohi,3e4wtr,Aabis_,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:37:20 2015 UTC,"Each player is allowed to buy an unban 3 times total.  If you are buying your first unban you buy the one with (first) after it, if you then get banned again and want to buy another you buy the one with (Second)  after it which is $10 more expensive, if you then get banned again you can buy one more unban which is the one with (third, final) after it and cost $40. If you then get banned again after buying the $40 unban, you will be blacklisted.   We don't feel $15 is expensive for an unban. The reason they get more expensive is to 1) Attempt to deter players from hacking because they can just buy an unban and 2) Server bills unfortunately require $$$ and if players do decide they want to spend the money to get unbanned, it definitely helps towards that.  We ask players to come into ts after buying an unban because unbans are done manually by admins so we basically have to watch the buycraft page 24/7 to catch everyone who buys one. If a player buys an unban and dosn't get unbanned in about 10 mins they should go into ts to alert an Admin to that fact."
