blackberry,3e61s7,pbeaul,2,Wed Jul 22 09:20:29 2015 UTC,"I have both, In terms of performance they are pretty much indistinguishable (CPU, camera and battery wise). The Classic has a noticeably larger and brighter screen with a slightly wider/more comfortable keyboard (for me). It also looks a little more polished than the Q10 (though the finish on the back of the Q10 feels much better).   I find that the Q10 is a much better one handed phone but now that I'm used to the Q20 the screen feels small. There's a better value to be had with the Q10 but if that's not a big factor the Q20 is probably the right direction to go in."

blackberry,3e2pvq,eddy_07,3,Tue Jul 21 21:13:34 2015 UTC,"I would say utilize the play lists. Separate your audio books and your songs and whatever else into separate play lists. Then if you want to listen to music tap the music Playlist. Want to listen to an audio book? Tap that play list. Do it once and that's it. You can back up playlists and move them to other devices. They are listed as .m3u files. As long as they are in the same folder as all your music they should work. Don't blame this on BlackBerry. Most devices will do the same thing and just shuffle all your MP3s regardless of what it is.  Edit: As for podcasts, have you tried using apps like Nobex if they are available for your device. They usually keep downloaded podcasts separate from your mp3s."

I can so blame blackberry, its their app, this seems like a use case that should have been discussed on day one of the design meetings for the music app. (speaking as a software developer myself)  If nobex drops an mp3 anywhere on the system (except maybe voicenotes as noted before) then the music play will pick them up."

Before messing with your phone make sure you have a full backup.  Autoloader upgrade = super easy way to flash your phone... You literally just plug it into your computer and run the auto loader file. This is what's known as a destructive update as it will erase everything on the phone.  Sachesi/non-destructive upgrade = a little more complicated way of upgrading your device but it won't remove the files/settings already on the device. It's very similarly to how carriers push out OTA updates. Guide on for non-destructive upgrade  There's also a BB10 OS archive located in the sticky's that has all the auto loaders for each device...

blackberry,3dz7i8,laketrout,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:47:31 2015 UTC,"Pretty much.  Hook your phone up to your PC via USB and run the autoloader. It will wipe and factory reset your phone so make sure you have everything backed up. While not required it's recommended you also do a ""security wipe"" on your phone after it's updated and rebooted. This will get rid of any ""crud"" OS and app files left behind.

blackberry,3dyabi,RchrdJ28,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:03:11 2015 UTC,"No, Snap is a bit different. Snap sort of ""emulates"" the Play Store for BB10 while the guide provides the full Play Store that you would find on any Android phone. The apps you download will update automatically if you have that setting turned on. Again, the guide gives you the exact Play Store complete with all features.  However, some apps won't run or have less features because Google Play Services isn't on BB10.

You can also prioritize the order things show up if the default doesn't work for you.  Learn a few of the more popular keyboard shortcuts and it will make it even more seamless to use."

blackberry,3dqaa1,WiFiForeheadWrinkles,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:47:42 2015 UTC,"Tnx for your reply. I'd like to ask you some follow up questions.   Do you have any noticeable lag when you use the PTV3000? Perhaps you notice a difference in different use cases, i.e. when you are watching (camera) pictures, or when you browse the Internet, or play a Youtube movie, or perhaps when you play an HD video via either the BlackBerry Video app or a third party video app, like KalemSoft MediaPlayer?   Since the Z30 has a 720 x 1280 screen, does the projected screen on a 1080 (HD) tv have 'blocks'?   I guess I try to ask about your experience with the image quality on the tv.   I also have another question regarding the technology that is used. Other replies to the OP reference MiraCast as the technology that is used. Is MiraCast used by the PTV3000 device or do I correctly understand that it uses a different technology that needs the Z30 and the PTV3000 to be connected to the same wireless router? So to mirror my screen 'on the go' I would have to carry along both a wireless router and the PTV3000?"
blackberry,3dqaa1,WiFiForeheadWrinkles,2,Mon Jul 20 07:37:47 2015 UTC,"1) There is sometimes lag with videos but it kind of ""settles down"" after a while and it's not terrible. I've read threads where certain downloaded movies will not play via Miracast because of DRM but I personally haven't run into that yet. No lag thus far with anything else.  2) It has black stripes down the side, if that's what you mean. If you rotate the device it fills up as much of the TV as possible. Things are pretty clear, not pixelated.  3) No, you don't have to carry a router. Just plug it into the TV, then choose Miracast under your WiFi settings on the Z30.   Hope this clears things up. =)"

In short: my advice is to go for Q10.  The keyboard of Q5 is a little bit loud and the keys are smaller (with more space between them) than on Q10. Q10 is heavier and lies quite nice in your hand. And since my girlfriend used my Q10 for a couple of days, she want to switch from Q5 aswell.   In addition, the camera is a little bit better: 5mp on Q5 and 8mp on Q10."
blackberry,3dm6th,schroet,5,Fri Jul 17 13:07:11 2015 UTC,been using Q5 for almost a year now. My experience with battery life not so good. It last about 16 hours all total. I will take it to blackberry customer care to try to fix that.   Other than that OS is top notch gives a lot of flexibility. Very little lag in apps(2 gb ram takes care of that). Hubs and gestures are really cool. On startup you get around 3 gb of space to install apps. Its mostly sufficient unless you install a lot of games. Android app compatibility is surprisingly good even better than my previous sony xperia. You just have to ensure you don't use apps that needs google play services. Even then google maps work. For app store you have plenty of choices. Always go for blackberry native app if possible. Other than that you have amazon app store which won't need google play services and are usually compatible and then you have google play store through snap or even the real play store for everything else.   Over all I would give it 4 stars. Had my battery life been good I would give it all 5 stars.
blackberry,3dm6th,minusSeven,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:32:15 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response! I'd like to say 16 hours is not much but I'm not getting much more from my G3 right now.

blackberry,3dm6th,dabeamer,2,Fri Jul 17 15:27:30 2015 UTC,"My z10 died the other week and I needed a phone quickly.   The Good:   Best Buy is selling them prepaid with Telus/Koodo for $99..I challenge you to find a better phone that you can outright purchase for that kind of money. I used some unlocking website and $30 later..I was on my Fido plan. The battery life is better than the Z10. I enjoy having the physical keyboard back.   The Bad:  It's annoying to update it-- you need to plug it into a computer because of lack of free space out of the box, but a minor nuisance. The camera sucks though, if you want to take a photo of say a concert or something the lowlight and low megapixels are a shame.   Of course I immediately sideloaded Snap so I can get instagram, which with the square screen is a touch annoying as full pictures are slightly too big. The iGrann ap an option which is optimized for it, but I prefer the real deal.   For $100 you can't really go wrong, but if you are needing heavy picture/web browsing capability this phone won't cut it. But if you're mostly emailing and texting and surfing twitter you can't go wrong.  I'm looking forward to the slider coming out later this year."

blackberry,3dkrq4,minusSeven,2,Fri Jul 17 06:18:31 2015 UTC,"Dump your phone ang replace it with a Z30 or passport if you're concerned about media consumption.  The whole point of blackberry is work/life balance. Carrying around two devices is a drag. Besides, the extra data cost you save by sticking with one device could be used to pay for a passport."
blackberry,3dkrq4,brkdncr,2,Fri Jul 17 06:24:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not a Blackberry fan but dammit do I love my Passport. I, too, am an Android enthusiast. I'm a developer to be more specific, but Android is by far my favorite platform. Still, when I got a Passport out of curiosity, I haven't been able to switch back to an Android device permanently. BB10 OS does everything I need it to, and the Passport's sexyness is an added bonus. Android is my favorite platform, the Passport is my favorite smartphhone.  Unfortunately, it doesn't have every popular app, nor does sideloading from Android always work (as is the case with snapchat and banking apps that use anti-piracy). But that just comes with the territory on a (relatively) new and non-mainstream operating system. That's really the one thing you need to watch out for, although it's not as dire as it may initially seem. You can, for example, side load the entire Google Play store and use it to download/purchase apps and even get refunds at usual."

blackberry,3dkrq4,alphaque,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:22:13 2015 UTC,"I currently a BlackBerry Q10 for emails/communication and a Galaxy Note 2 for everything else.  While the 9900 is a great phone (probably my favourite BlackBerry device in terms of hardware), I'd avoid getting a BBOS device. You need BIS or BES if you want your emails or any kind of data service on older devices, and that's an added cost on some mobile providers. Also, the app selection is nowhere near what is available on BB10 devices and many of the apps that are available haven't really been updated in a while.  I'd recommend saving up a little and getting a Q10. You could also pick up a Q5, which is cheaper, but it has a slightly weaker processor."
blackberry,3dkrq4,FedeSuchness,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:30:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! Do you have a separate line for your Note? Or do you use it as a WiFi only device?   I agree. The only reason I've been looking at the 9900 is because they're so cheap. I really don't NEED a second phone. So it seemed smart to go for the cheap option.
blackberry,3dkrq4,FedeSuchness,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:38:12 2015 UTC,"I have a separate line for each phone.  For $50, I can't blame you for wanting to pick it up for a play, but a BBOS device might not give you the best BlackBerry experience, which may turn you off the platform as a whole. I see some Q5s on eBay for about $100 buy now, but can't speak on how well the device performs in day to day use.  One other option would be to wait to see what happens with the BlackBerry Venice (slider). There have been rumours that it is running on Android, so that might suit you."

Also, for some reason, I feel like an all-touch Passport would be close to the perfect form factor for a modern smartphone.  I ended up being able to type faster on my Z10 than on a physical keyboard, but I just prefer the feel of a physical keyboard.  But, I still miss the sleekness and feel of flicking words with the Z10.  With the with of the Passport's screen, I think BlackBerry could have an awesome full touch phone."

I know, I type really fast on my Z30 too, it's just that no need to actually press anything. When I had my Q10 and Classic, I figured: This is just Z30 with half missing and KB is permanent, I went right back to my Z30. I am hoping it will be different with PP and I won't have to scroll as much. Another wish is one day be able to open two emails side by side."

blackberry,3dll6i,pbeaul,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:23:47 2015 UTC,"Right - I guess it's got to be a plain hole because translucent blue plastic would lend a bluish tinge to any notification LED colour, while black or white wouldn't.

You will want to try to do as much stuff as you can with native BB10 apps or the browser because Android apps aren't the best on the device and tend to use a lot of battery. Here are some quick points:   Reddit in Motion is arguably the best Reddit app on BB10  Uber is not availble for BB10 and the Android app doesn't work, so you need to use their mobile site. Kindle is available on the Amazon store and is okay. Not awful but also not as good as it could be. CIBC has a BB10 app but I've never used it. Transit apps aren't well represented on BB10. For TTC I had to download an Android app and patch it with Google Play Services to work on the Classic. I haven't tried Netflix but video in general isn't great because of the square screen.

blackberry,3dj6e3,Raptor007,2,Thu Jul 16 23:36:48 2015 UTC,"I think you should do it. Until a month ago, I was an Android loyalist since Froyo. Prior to that, I used an old as hell BB something-or-other (I can't remember the model...I think I still have it tho...thing had a JOG WHEEL) and loved it, but I was lured away to Android by shiny apps.  So when I went to upgrade my old-n-busted Samsung, I was just gonna get another Android, but then a certain square-shaped beauty caught my eye on the display, and the rest is (very recent) history.  So anyway, my point is that after 4+ years of being in the Android ecosystem, it took a little adjusting. What I learned is that a) I didn't even USE most of the apps in my library; b) those I DID use had a legit BB port or a comparable facsimile; c) the side-loaded Android app worked just fine in the event of no other option.  I can't speak to the Classic, but the form factor of the Passport was a little strange at first. I thought at first I might miss the length of the screen, but I quickly took comfort in the width of the device and find myself not missing the length at all. In fact, I find the 1:1 ratio MORE intuitive for certain apps, like GPS navigation and web browsing.  tl;dr: Go for it. It may be awkward at first, but I think you'll come to love it."
blackberry,3dj6e3,alfonsojon,2,Fri Jul 17 02:34:46 2015 UTC,"I'm also an Android-to-BB convert.  I switched from an iPhone to the Droid Pro back when it was new, loved the keyboard, and clung to that device for about 5 years waiting for a suitable replacement, even flashing it to an unsupported Cyanogen Android 4.0.  When I finally gave up on waiting for another good Android keyboard phone and I couldn't stand the sluggishness of that 5-year-old phone running an unsupported OS any longer, it occurred to me that I'm not much of an app person, and I'd be happy just having any faster phone with a full qwerty keyboard.  That's when I settled on the BlackBerry Classic as my next phone.  It came as a very pleasant surprise that I find the BB10 interface superior to Android in just about every way; I know it's been said to death around here, but the Hub really is the smartest way to manage communications on a smartphone.  As icing on the cake, my BlackBerry Classic can actually run Android apps far better than my old Android phone (probably not true for you, since your Android phone isn't as old as mine was).  And as a developer, I'm really excited about the idea of developing for QNX/BB10; the BB10 SDK seems a lot better thought-out than the Android SDK/NDK, and I'd much rather work with C++ than Java.  Sorry, this is kind of a ramble; I'm just excited about my BlackBerry Classic and wanted to share.  If you've enjoyed BlackBerries in the past but want something a little more touchscreen and app friendly now, I suspect a Classic with BB10 is exactly what you're looking for."

I honestly have no regrets about switching to my Classic, although it's been rough given my former dependence on the Google cloud. If you're a heavy Google+, Hangouts, Photos, or Google Maps user, it may be hard to switch. The app market is a lot slimmer, but there is an app called Snap which gives you access to the Play Store (no compatibility guaranteed!). There are technical ways to get Android apps that depend on Google Play Services working on BlackBerry 10... but it's so complicated that updates become impossible.  Long story short, if you can get used to living off the Google cloud, it's a great switch."

blackberry,3dj6e3,TheTillmanator,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:04:02 2015 UTC,"I've got a Q10. WhatsApp is actually integrated into BB10, shows up on the hub and everything. Native Reddit is fine, Skype also... I'm using some Android apps for public transport and stuff, everything works. My bank app doesn't work but then I just use their website from browser when I really need to. I also used to listen to mixcloud through their app, but now it uses google play services for some reason, so it doesn't work anymore. Website works though, so it's fine. Most mobile apps these days are just websites in a shell anyway, so it really doesn't matter in the end.  I'm not into apps, I just use my phone to communicate and check some things online. As far as it goes for me I'm not really missing anything compared to when I had an Android phone. Maybe a proper youtube app would be nice, but that's about it. And BB10 WhatsApp smileys are way cooler than the original ones, I wish they would show up in conversations too."

blackberry,3dhkfg,maskx,9,Thu Jul 16 09:31:33 2015 UTC,"Current passport user here, I will try to answer your questions.  Reddit: I use Reddit in Motion, an app specifically designed for blackberry which works well enough. I write this comment through the app.  Videos: I watch youtube often enough, the aspect ratio doesn't bother me at all, the black lines above and below are a familiar enough site to anyone who watches tv.  Sharing: yes sharing works in the exact same way to android, the share symbol is even the same. I've used this to share via bluetooth, facebook, twitter, email, whatsapp.  Why I chose a BlackBerry: Honestly for me personally it's partly privacy (I won't accept apple's or google's terms and conditions). And partly the amazing keyboard. The passport keyboard is also a touch pad and I love having a control option that is not part of the screen.  Differences between AT&amp;T and regular passport: As far as I know the differences are cosmetic only. Living in the UK I have never seen an AT&amp;T passport but I'm pretty sure it's basically the same with rounded corners and a little extra aluminium on the bezel.  I hope this helps!  Edit: forgot your time related question. My answer is that if the passport is the Blackberry you're considering now is as good a time as any to buy one, the upcoming line appear different enough that the passport will still fill it's niche. If I were considering a Z30 or Leap rather than the Passport I would seriously consider waiting though."
blackberry,3dhkfg,bacon_reader_user,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:39:53 2015 UTC,The reddit apps are not as flashy as sync or relay or Alien Blue but they work really well. That coupled with the keyboard makes using blackberry reddit apps pretty great. Probably my favorite mobile reddit experiance

You can watch videos on them, it's not annoying, it's a bit smaller than my Z10, but not horrible.   And I don't know about your third question. This is where BlackBerry fuck themselves over...  Edit; sharing is similar to Android, almost exactly the same, I'd say..."
blackberry,3dhkfg,wolfman86,3,Thu Jul 16 10:37:00 2015 UTC,"Been using the passport for a few months now. Awesome keyboard, beautiful screen, great performance. App selection is okay, coming from android was weird but really showed me how little I actually used the 90ish apps I had installed. Anything I really need can be installed fairly easily (someone on crackberry built a google play store for blackberry) Sharing is the same. Att passport has round edges, thats it.  Personally, I would wait. A newer version of the passport has been leaked as well as the blackberry slider, no point in buying now.  I've been a nexus fan since the galaxy nexus, so I do love android. Blackberry have really nailed the OS this time round, very intuitive and fast, the proper multitasking is amazing (you can hear youtube while its minimized, and apps continue to run/load when mimized). The only bad thing is the lack of apps, some things like google maps or snapcchat do not sideload.  Main reason is the blackbery hub, what an awesome experience!!!"

The software rocks. Built on QNX. Most current software built from the ground up for the mobile market.   How is the Reddit app selection?   I use Reddit In Motion and don't even think about finding another app.   Are the videos too small to see anything?   When I watch my 55"" flat screen ... I see black bars above and below the video. Images are sharp and easily viewable.   Is now a good time to consider the passport? I know blackberry is planning on releasing a new phone soon and my contract doesn't expire till around December.   You may be lucky and have the option of looking at 1 or 2 new BlackBerry devices that may be released at that time.   Is sharing on blackberry similar to sharing on android? Like, can I share an image to a program of my choice?   Yes. You can even Share an email to the ""Remember"" app (tasks) to create a dated task."

blackberry,3dhkfg,flexastexas,2,Sat Jul 18 17:08:46 2015 UTC,"New blackberry user here. (coming from Android).  I bought a passport and classic at the same time and have been using them both. In a nutshell, the Passport has great specs (camera, performance) but ergonomically it's the tactile equivalent of a sneeze that won't come out; There's something persistently uneasy about holding it--with one hand or two. With most phones, typing with two hands is preferable; with the Passport, doing anything on the phone feels clumsy without two hands. And frankly, even when you use two hands the phone is slippery and large enough that it requires some modicum of effort/attention to navigate.   On the other hand, the Classic feels terrific to type and to hold while browsing, swiping, reading, etc. I can go seamlessly between one and two hands and the phone is so comfortable that it 'disappears' and I can focus on whatever content I am engaging with instead of navigating the phone.   Unfortunately, the specs on the Classic are unimpressive. In particular, the camera and speed: I took some pics side by side and the Passport seemed much better. Pages load lighting fast on the Passport too and, while not slow on the Classic, you notice the difference. The Classic camera feels just serviceable. But with so much of your life represented online, having a great camera is actually really important!  Not sure yet which I will go with. I am thinking about adding some grip pads to the Passport to see if that makes it easier to hold. And I will look at the pictures from both devices on my computer. Perhaps they pictures are of comparable quality but the Passport screen makes them look better.   Would appreciate other people's thoughts on this. No reason to make another 'Blackberry vs Passport' thread here if not necessary.   Edit: noticing a very small slit between the tool belt and the bottom of the screen. It's very small but I'd bet water damage could happen really easily through that. Anybody have any water damage on their classic?"

Websites should not be displaying videos and content using flash anymore as there are many other more secure mediums to share content. Flash needs to die sooner than later.
blackberry,3ddc5d,civilservant2011,3,Wed Jul 15 12:04:23 2015 UTC,BlackBerry dropped flash quite a while ago. It isn't included in OS 10.3.1+. If you really need flash look up Zeus Browser in App World.

blackberry,3ddc5d,pbeaul,2,Wed Jul 15 12:24:42 2015 UTC,BlackBerry only stopped supporting it because Adobe (the people that own it) stopped its support/development of the Android Flash player sometime in 2011-2012... And it was long past the point of being able to justify the massive liability.  Flash is notoriously buggy and a huge security nightmare because it's constantly being hacked and exposing its users to very significant threats.

blackberry,3ddu1z,Wicelo,6,Wed Jul 15 14:23:20 2015 UTC,"There's no way to root a BlackBerry, at least not yet. The Bootloader has a key that verifies the checksum of the OS - if you change something (like rooting it) then the phone doesn't boot at all. The Bootloader is in protected memory space that even employees don't have access to without a special hardware dongle. There are 'unsecure' devices that early alpha/beta testers use that in theory could run a different OS or support rooting, but production devices that are 'secured' won't.   So your question about privacy on a rooted BlackBerry is irrelevant now.   Enabling data encryption simply means that data in the memory of the device is encrypted, but applications will still be able to access that data.   The reason I said ""yet"" regarding BlackBerry rooting is because they're moving over to Android it looks like, which might mean new rooting possibilities. We'll see what the future holds.

blackberry,3ddu1z,RevisionCuda,2,Wed Jul 15 15:12:00 2015 UTC,"The most secure option involves having a BES (BlackBerry Enterprise Server) Which would basically 'split' your device into two parts: The personal side and the work side. The personal side would have everything you see now, but the work side would have only work-specific applications. There are some apps that are classified as Hybrid apps which have access to both sides, (Hub, Calendar, for example) but most have only access to the personal side which means you could control the sensitive data on the work side of things.   What is so necessary that you're trying to protect?"

Imagine a psycopath working at NSA or BB or developping a famous app, he could just spy on people via the camera and microphone, know where they live, their habits, their calendar et do whatever consequently.

I have 5 emails (2 push, 2 30min sync and 1 4hr sync) did ~30 minutes of calls decent amount of texting/emailing and a little browsing and my phone consistently lasted 30-36 hours.  5) Don't use whatsApp... But I believe the app is a native BB10 app (not a Android port, optimized for BB10) and from what I've seen it looks pretty good.  6) From the home screen type ""BBVE"" that should pull up the BBVE (BlackBerry Virtual Expert) app, spend 10+ minutes to run it though all the tests. It's a pretty extensive test suite that tests most things that could go wrong with it. You'll need a pair of earbuds/headset to test the headset jack/radio."

I'd assume that the Slider and select (maybe high end?) devices would come with it once it came out.

blackberry,3cx743,ltlt1,2,Sat Jul 11 15:57:45 2015 UTC,"Which BB phone? The Z30, Passport and Leap have truly outstanding battery life. Haven't tried the Classic but I hear it's good too. Anything older is so-so. The Sonys you list have great battery life too.   If you want a comparison by numbers, they have the following battery sizes in mAh:    Sony Xperia Z3 - 3,100 Sony Xperia Z3 Compact - 2,600 BB Leap - 2,800 BB Z30 - 2,880 BB Passport - 3,450   The Passport and the Z3 have better screens so they will consume more battery. The Z3 compact has a smaller screen so that compensates for the smaller battery. In general I find BB10 to be less battery intensive than Android as an OS so there's that to factor in.   Regardless, all the phones I listed should have excellent battery life that get you through more than a whole day, they are all safe picks in this regard. Of course, if you ask me I would recommend a BB!"
blackberry,3cx743,columbo222,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:48:59 2015 UTC,"OK, thanks, and in order to make less confusion, I meant to say if any BB phone beats Z3/C in terms of battery life. Some BB users said that they can get 3 days (one even said 4), but maybe because of moderate usage, where Sony's website and many people say they get 2 days of usage (probably heavier). I want to get BB to try, but they are rather expensive, unless bought used, I couldn't find any of BB phones displayed in store, so I have no experience (except reading and watching reviews) of BB10. One carrier has it in my country, but none of them display those phones. When talking about battery life, BB phones on GSMArena show battery lives shorter than some competitors... Also, is Z30 still a good phone to buy? Because ALMOST ALL BB phones have a freaking old MSM8960 CPU. Are Android apps laggy on Z30? I need Viber and maybe Skype and some small apps... Sorry for long story.  TL;DR Is Z30 still a good phone and will it get updated? How is the performance of Android apps, and how do Android and Native Skype work?"
blackberry,3cx743,columbo222,2,Sat Jul 11 18:16:38 2015 UTC,"It really depends on how you use the phone. If you want to run 20 Android apps yeah that will affect battery life and you'd better just get an Android phone. If you want to run just a handful (like I do), it's not an issue. Skype is fine, I've never used Viber.   The Z30 is continuing to be updated, yes. It just got an update to 10.3.1 a couple of months ago and it'll get 10.3.2 soon. The performance improves each time IMO, especially the Android app performance.   Again, both phones shouldn't give you any problems at all in terms of battery! It's hard to directly compare though since the usage will be different, especially as it pertains to Android apps."

blackberry,3cthus,BlackBerryClassico,14,Fri Jul 10 17:23:57 2015 UTC,"I hope BB keeps their OS too. I've heard others mention the possibility that the OS will remain intact, but there will be an option to run Android in parallel.   Does anyone have concerns over BB getting in bed with Google in terms of security? I wonder what the risks are and what BB will do to mitigate them. Will they be transparent about risks that can't be mitigated?"
blackberry,3cthus,BluePirate,11,Fri Jul 10 17:58:14 2015 UTC,"I think this parallel OS stuff is entirely BS, maybe I'm not visionary enough, but I just can't see the phone running 2 operating systems at the same time and being able to switching between them (quickly/painlessly). I know it's technically possible, but it's a user experience disaster in the making.  My concerns about getting in bed with Google are not so much security as they are privacy. Google's entire business revolves around monetizing their users eyeballs/data...  I don't mind paying for products that provide me with value, I do mind not being in control of my data, and having pretty much zero control over becoming the product."
blackberry,3cthus,pbeaul,-1,Fri Jul 10 18:26:24 2015 UTC,"+1. Android on a phone has negative value to me, because of all the time and effort I'd have to spend removing the Google services. If Blackberry really did a dual-boot phone I'd probably try to put Nemo or Windows Mobile on instead of Android.  I don't think they will do a dual-boot, though - as you say, it would be terribly cumbersome. If they did put full Android on a phone they'd be more likely to have both running at once with some kind of interface to switch between, and they'd have to have some files shared between the OSs; which would remove any perception of enhanced security on BB phones.  As it is Android is too insecure and tracker-ridden to be a suitable partner for BB10. Perhaps if Blackberry can make some improvements to Android over the next couple of years it can use Android without damaging its perceived security (though I don't think Google will let them make the improvements) - until then, all we'll probably get is improvements to the emulator."
blackberry,3cthus,citrojohn,0,Sat Jul 11 00:21:04 2015 UTC,"BB10 already runs an Android subsystem on the BB operating system, and by and large, it does it very well. What I'd like to see is a more compatible subsystem, with Google Play Services. A bit more performance wouldn't hurt either."
blackberry,3cthus,Claidheamhmor,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:16:48 2015 UTC,"Probably won't be parallel OS. More likely, BB will make a BB10 skin for the underlying android OS, much like other vendors do(Oppo with ColorOS for example)."
blackberry,3cthus,sacrilegious,12,Sat Jul 11 14:42:17 2015 UTC,BB10 is the superior software. Android is bloated and gross.
blackberry,3cthus,EseJandro,10,Fri Jul 10 18:49:42 2015 UTC,"Former Android user here.  I really couldn't care less about the OS. I care about how well the device meets my needs as a consumer. As a consumer, I use Google apps. I write a lot of email from my phone. I like streaming music. I like wasting time on Facebook. I like security.  Both operating systems and hardware platforms meet these to varying degrees. If mixing up the OS with the hardware hits more of these points more effectively, I'll switch.  The device is a tool. If they make a better tool, I'm not married to this one."
blackberry,3cthus,FightingLight,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:34:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I enjoy jumping back and forth between BB10 and WP quite a bit; both OS's do things that the other won't/can't and being able to have the device that fits my needs is my primary concern when looking for a new smartphone.   I do however really enjoy Hub and the Classic's keyboard, but those are just perks of my current device."
blackberry,3cthus,Nimiety_One,0,Sat Jul 11 14:03:46 2015 UTC,I agree.  I like blackberry hardware but the os doesn't meet my needs.
blackberry,3cthus,Kailuafornia,3,Sat Jul 11 12:56:46 2015 UTC,"I really think this whole 'Dual Boot' and two OS in a single device is a bit of a STRETCH. BlackBerry decides to make Android devices alongside, it's that simple. Don't stretch it. BlackBerry and John Chen have been working through thin and thick with confidence in BB10 OS for years now. They're not going to give up on it so easily. It's cool that BlackBerry is filling the void by making KB devices running Android."
blackberry,3cthus,Medfried,3,Sat Jul 11 01:01:11 2015 UTC,I just don't want this place to be flooded with Android-centric posts (esp if they do release an Android phone) and have to create r/BB10.
blackberry,3cthus,stoneeus,3,Sat Jul 11 01:42:20 2015 UTC,"Eh, I've used a few Android phones since switching to BB10 and I end up frustrated every time, no matter how nicely I customize the phone.  Can't beat the BB10 keyboard/hub, for sure."
blackberry,3cthus,Baconwich,4,Sat Jul 11 14:47:06 2015 UTC,"I'm a little concerned, because I was looking for my next phone to get away from the lag that Android brings.  What I have been hoping for this whole time is that they make a deal with Google. Like ""we'll help make Android more secure, you help us run android apps on our OS better and let us get the Play Store"" rather than just going full Android."
blackberry,3cthus,BrettGilpin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:52:16 2015 UTC,Oooh I love this idea.
blackberry,3cthus,minusSeven,2,Sat Jul 11 06:13:55 2015 UTC,Previous android user here. I came to blackberry because I was in search of a good phone with physical keyboard. Android app compatibility was a huge incentive. But since then I haven't looked back. There are a number of things blackberry does better than android. So much so  that I have no intention of going back to android.   I wish android fanboys just gave blackberry phones a decent try before wishing blackberry goes android.
blackberry,3cthus,Atlas_Vaughn,2,Sat Jul 11 06:42:20 2015 UTC,"I have ran just about every operating system developed since 2002-ish. I can only hope BlackBerry continues to improve their operating system as opposed to adopting someone else's. Android, Apple and Windows Mobile all have their respective advantages and disadvantages. The bottom line though, I switched from using those operating systems and their ecosystems back to BlackBerry. I now have the same phone for business and personal use, paid for out of my pocket. I now seamlessly  belong to all of the previously mentioned ecosystems. The only integration lacking is accessing iCloud drive. I currently have to do this via the Web browser in desktop mode. All of my contacts, calendars and email from those ecosystems took nothing more than a username and password to access. Box and Drive have native applications  which perform  quite nicely. In summary, I hope BlackBerry understands their heritage and improves on the things which made them so well loved. I hope BlackBerry  does not become distracted by all the flash and glamour of the mainstream."

How a boat load of Android users are dying for keyboards, ready and willing to pay vast sums of money for the mythical device they pretty much know nothing about.  Odd that with so many physical keyboard lovers no Android manufacturer has figured out how to turn it into a viable market...  My only hope is that BB10 doesn't die too quickly."

blackberry,3cv86c,anikain,2,Sun Jul 12 10:00:04 2015 UTC,I contacted O2 Germany and they say they cannot interfere with updates on unbranded devices. I guess their support doesn't know much about BB?

blackberry,3cs304,garcia85,19,Fri Jul 10 09:05:58 2015 UTC,"I get what the author is trying to say, but I disagree that BB10 is awful. Yes, app support is bad. But I prefer BB10 to Android overall. The hub, true multitasking, and the fluidity of actions is just miles ahead of Android. If these people actually tried to use a Blackberry for more than a week, I'm sure they would see that BB10 is flawed but far from awful.  This Android stuff has me a bit worried honestly. Android on my One M8 has more stutters and crashes than my Classic in regular use. Plus the battery is abysmal. If you look at a spec sheet, it shouldn't be that way. But in actual use, Android has a ton of issues. If Blackberry can fix most of those issues, then I'll happily accept Android on their devices. But that's a big ""if""."
blackberry,3cs304,RchrdJ28,11,Fri Jul 10 13:15:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's a little too negative towards BB10. It's a great OS, even without all the apps. Android isn't the miracle he wants it to be."
blackberry,3cs304,CherryDaBomb,5,Fri Jul 10 13:30:25 2015 UTC,Based on his comments I'd imagine he's never seen BB10.     He's probably thinking of OS5 or 6 as do most other bloggers.
blackberry,3cs304,JabberJaahs,9,Fri Jul 10 18:37:08 2015 UTC,"Similarly, I'll suddenly stop caring about BlackBerry if they abandon their operating system. It would simply indicate that they've given in to the ""worse is better"" mentality for some quick bucks. Mike Lazaridis knew that wasn't going to be viable for their security model years ago (and that hasn't and will not change).  So, if they decide to just sell their name and badge for some quick and dirty credibility on otherwise horrifically insecure devices, then they'll blow that reputation away in a single device generation and lose even their niche relevance.   BlackBerry might become more relevant to a handful of consumers who only comprehend apps and feature lists (or non-technical journalists like this guy), but without actual value or advantages in their software, how long can that possibly last?    As for security, well, it’s true that BB has always crushed Android. But after Google’s introduction of Android for Work, a service that makes Android more work-friendly and secure, that security gap is narrower than ever before.   This is just plain wrong. The distance has not changed because Android remains Linux-based. It has the same liabilities it has had for the last couple decades and it's not viable for the same reasons it wasn't viable when Lazaridis chose to build a system on QNX a few years ago. People who believe that there's ""progress"" being made don't understand OS architecture. Flawed architecture doesn't get patched away-- just ask Microsoft."
blackberry,3cs304,crackerbarreljoe,0,Fri Jul 10 15:09:38 2015 UTC,Blackberry needs to stay relevant.  Most consumers don't care about security or productivity.  They want conveinance and simplicity.  Blackberry should deliver that to them since these people make up 97% of the market.  Catering to minority consumers is dumb from a business standpoint.
blackberry,3cs304,Kailuafornia,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:03:10 2015 UTC,"Is there money in the consumer market, though? That seems like a longterm losing battle against mainland China."

blackberry,3cs304,theMaltLiquorHour,4,Fri Jul 10 13:24:26 2015 UTC,"An interesting article but BB10 isn't exactly antiquated nor outdated as the author tries to state. The native app selection sucks for sure, but I also find the argument that ""if you're going to download android apps why not buy an Android phone"" to miss the point. That perspective exists when your paradigm revolves around being beholden to apps. I'm fine using an Android apps to help me do the extra stuff I want but I'm equally concerned about the core functionality, which is what I admire about BB10."
blackberry,3cs304,stoneeus,3,Fri Jul 10 14:08:33 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand the author of the article's bias against BB10. I remember getting my first BlackBerry phone, a Q10. I had only had devices with Android and iOS before, and had been an Android advocate for years. The first time I tried navigating my Q10, I hated it. I only got the phone because I needed a new one and someone had a new Q10 he bought for his wife that she didn't like and he was trying to quickly sell it off for $100. I hated it, I liked the keyboard, but I hated the gesture based navigation. But a week in, I couldn't use my android devices without wanting to throw them across the room because they lagged randomly on the homescreen, I didn't like having to press a home button anymore, and they didn't have the hub. Screw notification drawers, I want my damn hub. Once I got to know the OS, it was so much better than anything else I used. I stopped caring about stupid things like snapchat and millions of games on my phone. All I needed on my little Q10 was iGrann, reddit in motion, fb, twitter, and brickbreaker bold. Oh, and the blackberry presentation software is amazing, so many school presentations done simply on my phone and an HDMI cable from my Q10 to the projector. Before judging and calling BB10 horrible, use a blackberry past your initial cringing at how different it is. Those people who like it are loyal to BlackBerry for a reason, we just wish more people would see that reason."

With the exception of app support ( I know it's a big deal to some) Blackberry 10 is superior to Android and iOS in pretty much every way. It works better, the interface is better...I'm not sure how anyone who's actually used bb10 for any period of time can say it's bad."

If someone were to ask me to recommend them a phone, I wouldn't immediately say Android. More often than not I'd probably say an iPhone.   I find it funny that people try justify some things that blackberry might lack.  ""oh bb doesn't have many apps? That's okay, I'm all about business!

blackberry,3cu6pf,WiFiForeheadWrinkles,3,Fri Jul 10 21:14:30 2015 UTC,I've used both. The spacing didn't help my typing much on the Q5 over the Q10. Q10's quality for the keyboard is a lot better.

blackberry,3cu6pf,thebravelittlenublet,3,Sat Jul 11 00:29:02 2015 UTC,"The reason for the clickier keys on the Q5 is that they aren't stuck to the key-press sensor buttons like they are on the Q10, so it doesn't feel quite as solid.  The good thing about that, though, is that it appears to be dust or something else getting caught under the key in the adhesive that's causing the ever popular ""double-typing"" problem, as some Q10s don't seem to have that sealed properly.  Honestly I really enjoyed typing on the Q5, and switching to the Classic was harder than I'd thought (even though I had a Q10 before the Q5).  Q5 keyboard works great if you've not clipped your fingernails in a while, Q10 keyboard requires more regular fingernail maintenance.  In my experience."
blackberry,3cu6pf,Baconwich,2,Sat Jul 11 14:55:00 2015 UTC,"I find the Q5 a bit more clicks and plastic. It does not have the same quality feeling. However, the spacing on the Q5 is a bit larger and thus feels a bit easier to hit the right keys. Think back to the old curve vs bold"

Come to think of it, a secure Android with the Hub (the really standing out software feature, from a former 2.0->5.0 Android User) would render BB OS basically useless... but that would depend on Google accepts to ""not watch over the phone"" like they do with Android."

blackberry,3cqkc1,jcraig3k,2,Fri Jul 10 21:19:46 2015 UTC,I stopped using facebook app when they split the messenger.  I'd suggest you use a seperate browser and set facebook as your homepage. You can do everything on their mobile site including check messages.
blackberry,3cqkc1,Claidheamhmor,2,Fri Jul 10 09:20:30 2015 UTC,"The messenger thing doesn't bother me, I rather prefer having messages be part of the base app. The only thing I wish the BlackBerry FB app would do is let me see and make direct comment replies. Whenever I see that someone replied to a comment I made I have to bring up the FB website to view it.   Which the FB page still pulls up great in the BlackBerry browser but it's still inconvenient."

blackberry,3cpxxz,igor37,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:24:27 2015 UTC,"Two-handed use wouldn't be a problem really.

I've use the android and the iOS and hate both compared to BB10. BB10 everything seems to just be right where I want and need it to be. I'm not changing anytime soon.

I got the iPhone because of the app support and iTunes. But I miss BB security and ease of use so I am switching back. I am waiting for the BB Classic in Cobalt to be released by Verizon.  As a side note, my brother bought me a Samsung Tab 3 and I really don't like it. The feel, the interface, & the bloatware are just horrible. I still love and use the Playbook though. It is an excellent piece of hardware. I wish BB still supported it though. Also Playbook accessories are super cheap now. I bought a lightning charger and bluetooth keyboard for 30 dollars on Amazon the other day."

blackberry,3cpxxz,missy789,2,Tue Jul 14 17:17:52 2015 UTC,iPhone user. Would like to go back to Blackberry which I had a few of over the years. But if they go the Android route then I'd probably avoid them.   Loved the 9930 and Q10 but lack of apps and texting issues sent me to iPhone.   I definitely miss the superior email and the physical keyboard.
blackberry,3cpxxz,gnuarch,2,Fri Jul 10 04:48:08 2015 UTC,"Windows Phone currently, but I have a note 2 and s4 (gifts). I keep using them for Snapchat and other apps I need for work but then get annoyed at their shit cameras, poorly lit screens outdoors and horrible virtual keyboards. I strongly debated Passport but can't justify the camera downgrade since I have to buy off contract, I know that would bug me after a while.   I ended up staying for the Android rumors. Before I pull the trigger on a LG G4, I want to get a finalized picture on what the Slider or any other new devices released this year from Blackberry will be like. I need to upgrade my phone because the battery is shot on it. The G4 just seems the most practical for my needs, I'm not particularly in love with it, so I'm dragging out my lumia for as long as possible. I have a strong preference for a physical keyboard so Blackberry has a huge leg up over everyone else but I can still type on other devices so I'm trying not to let that lure me in. But I will hate myself if I buy a G4, locking myself into a contract for 2 years and then find out that Blackberry found a reliable way to use google play services and better camera algorithm with a sick physical keyboard... haaaate myself.   So I'm watching and waiting... hoping Blackberry makes the decision ridiculously easy because I would love to come back to Blackberry. I'll wait until November, then I'm pulling the trigger.

blackberry,3cpin7,eddy_07,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:58:03 2015 UTC,"But it's not all about devices. It's the phone + OS combo, which in black berry's case just seems to be better. For Microsoft, you are stuck with a rudimentary OS, pretty basic phones, and lack of apps. BB has a fantastic OS, at least decent devices, and support for Android apps."
blackberry,3cpin7,eddy_07,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:20:16 2015 UTC,"The article says BlackBerry is not worried about their small market share because it's users are more loyal. I don't think that's really true. Many are loyal, but not enough really. Also many BlackBerry loyalists are being forced away from BlackBerry due to unsupported MDM at work or for other reasons outside of BlackBerry's control such as a specific app used by peers for school, work or social communication. Microsoft has these same issues. Many others are being swayed by the constant barrage of ""BBRY is dead"" articles. Both MSFT and BBRY have the stigma of ""no apps"" attached to them. Apple and Google have too strong a grasp of this app market and it is tough for other companies to compete."
blackberry,3cpin7,MvLGuardian,0,Fri Jul 10 01:20:38 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily.   I for one I'm not concerned about the lack of apps on BB because I can always use android apps. But on Windows Phone there's no such thing. They will allow android and iOS apps but only after devs port them, so not such a big deal anyway."
blackberry,3cpin7,MvLGuardian,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:20:27 2015 UTC,"MSFT has the upper hand here. They have a greater market share. We must include all the Windows devices that will be upgraded to Windows 10. That will get them developer support. As it is, BlackBerry will be left with only Android apps since many native developers are currently looking for greener pastures. Native development trumps Android emulation. Lack of apps on BlackBerry doesn't bother me either, but I can't say the same for others. Many more still are swayed by the ""no apps"" argument at the phone store when realistically it wouldn't affect them either."
blackberry,3cpin7,minusSeven,0,Fri Jul 10 11:55:18 2015 UTC,"Wrong. Windows Phone has both Android Apps and iOS apps. Actually, Candy Crush on WP8 is the iOS version. And with windows 10 the market share will expand across Xbox/Phone/PC/Tablet/IoT so really, why wouldn't a developer want to develop a universal app. Build it once and deploy across all platforms. Even the Android/iOS conversion tools Microsoft has made for Windows 10 has already gained a good adoption rate.   On this point, the fact a BlackBerry user must resort to Android apps to get their fix is a negative. Hell even M$ managed to get Instagram (albeit it needs more work, but at least its there)"

blackberry,3cq5h0,taliesynD,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:48:06 2015 UTC,I'm in the UK but I assume it's the same elsewhere: if you don't change tariff at contract end they will continue to rape your pocketbook for the same monthly amount even though the phone is paid for. This might even be a LPT: Redo your tariff at contract end if you don't want to overpay.

Are you driving while issuing commands?  I ask because of my own personal experiences.  When I'm using the handset directly or in my car and connected to bluetooth and driving at a moderate speed, assistant has no trouble understanding my commands.  Once I'm going 80km or greater it has a lot of trouble and rarely understands me.  I imagine it has to do with the background noise."
blackberry,3cnr9z,sheepsix,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:23:48 2015 UTC,"I am using it directly, holding the phone close by. It can understand everything I am saying, however it simply will not complete the command. I do feel that when driving above 100km/h i have to speak as clearly and as possible, which I try to anyways.   The assistant understanding me isn't the issue, because once it listens to what I say, and takes a second to send it out to wolfram alpha and bring it back, it repeats what I have said, and then defaults to the command wasn't undertstood."

blackberry,3cjvmf,rudejester,4,Wed Jul 8 14:31:34 2015 UTC,Blackberry ltd. Registered 2 domain names; androidsecured.com /.net
blackberry,3cjvmf,69hailsatan,2,Thu Jul 9 18:00:47 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling this is more of an infrastructure thing, currently BlackBerry uses <co>.bbsecure.com for registering Android and iPhone devices for BES 10+.  They're likely registering domain names for new infrastructure for that...  Pretty much all other traffic runs to BlackBerry's own APN, some slightly different stuff for android+iPhone BBM, but the same ideas.  Overall I'd say it's a blip of nothing too important."

blackberry,3ckfqi,CHOAYO,4,Thu Jul 9 12:07:06 2015 UTC,"Prefer this link to the one submitted 2 hrs ago because at least this one has the domain name in the title.  If this is capitalized on and not a domain name used for something already in existence (ie their BES integration), this could be really huge. Blackberry fans are happy because their number 1 priority is security (and that keyboard, obviously), and fans of Android are happy because they get Blackberry benefits with the comfort of their ecosystem.

blackberry,3cm7ox,TxdoHawk,2,Thu Jul 9 19:38:35 2015 UTC,"In most cases, the BlackBerry Hub will retroactively download a good collection of your email history when you add and activate your email accounts. You can temporarily cause the Hub to download a longer history by changing the Sync settings on the account configuration page; for me at least, this downloaded a lot of messages.  When you add the relevant accounts, any contacts tied to them will also be automatically imported. For the ones residing on iPhone's local storage, download the Device Switch apps from BB World and the Apple App Store, and run them.  Make sure to deregister your iMessage by going to this site: https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage and entering your phone number. Apple will send you a message to confirm. This is a major annoyance with leaving the iOS ecosystem but deregistering will cause texts from your iPhone friends to be routed correctly as SMS and not iMessage.  P.S. After a week I promise you that you will never want to leave the Hub experience!"

blackberry,3cjrk1,bipnoodooshup,2,Wed Jul 8 13:30:10 2015 UTC,"There are many factors when it comes to battery usage that ""normal"" isn't really a useful metric, but screen-on time will always be, by far, one of the largest drains. If you are talking a solid hour of active use of the phone with the screen on, 10% doesn't seem particularly egregious. (Just as a comparison example, I had a Samsung Nexus S years ago that would be nearly dead after most of a work day, with 3-4 hours of ""screen on"" time. Pretty atrocious.)"
blackberry,3cjrk1,TxdoHawk,0,Wed Jul 8 14:16:02 2015 UTC,I guess you're right. It's just weird how the battery is bigger than the iphone 6 but yet I could browse during my morning commute and only lose like 3 or 4 percent.
blackberry,3cjrk1,TxdoHawk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:23:08 2015 UTC,"iOS has a heavy lean toward battery efficiency over everything else, but that comes with tradeoffs (ask app developers, for example, about what a nightmare it can be to properly do things in the background when the app isn't in focus.)  I also wouldn't get too caught up on percentages, the precise measurement of battery life left in a phone is often more art than science (which is why many companies don't show a percentage by default.) Better to look at more reliable numbers, such as how many hours in a day you can get through before the phone shuts off."

Blackberry is playing the market by aggressively pricing their devices so that it would sell better.  It would make no sense for BlackBerry to sell a device that is over 1000 msrp, likely no sales will happen."
blackberry,3ch6qa,RevisionCuda,3,Tue Jul 7 22:39:32 2015 UTC,Probably on par with other high ends like the S6 and G4. So probably somewhere in the $700-1000 range.

Then again, I'm not into pictosnap, iChat, sheepville, farmsodapop, or whatever other timewasting games and flavor-of-the-minute photo editing apps you kids are these days, so maybe that's more appealing to you.  What I am into is being able to run YouTube in the background or another tab, no problem - let's see you do that on Android or iPhone. I'm into having all of my Android apps on my phone and having other features - and I've got that. I'm into a great browser, and guess what? BB's is built on the same browser tech as iPhone's and Android's, so they function pretty much the same.   I'm into real multi-tasking - not having applications close, crash, or do a faux-multitasking ""save state"" in the background - BlackbBerry Passport does this.  I'm into all day battery life, hassle-free tethering and networking, and blazing fast speeds - the Passport delivers all of those.   So, what's your issue?    pretty much give away phones that do the same thing   Bullshit. I've yet to see another phone with the Passport's design and/or specs. They give away 3 year old models. They're not giving away the HTC One or the Galaxy S6. Those models cost more than the Passport.  You're sounding like a troll."

The low prices you always see on commercials and such are prices that apply when you sign up for a two-year contract, where you overpay for your service in order to make up for the price difference of the phone you got. An iPhone 6 costs $649, not $199. A Samsung Galaxy S6 edge costs $749. I'm not making these numbers up, as they are in fact the true prices of flagship phones without contract. The Passport costs $450 if you pay for it in full. If you care to sign a contract, the price of the Passport is $99.  So yes, the Passport is in fact an excellent deal."

blackberry,3cg4ti,pillboi,2,Tue Jul 7 20:17:51 2015 UTC,The HUB on android won't be anywhere close to as good as what exists on BB10.  It will be a glorified email client with SMS/BBM capabilities baked in and that's probably it. You can't easily recreate what BB10 is doing in an ecosystem/OS that BlackBerry has little control over.   Any integration outside of that will require collaboration from external parties which isn't likely to happen unless BlackBerry gains a serious Android following.

Also they should consider battery life and performance. ~ Actually, I would also take an improved version of Android Runtime bc I really like that in combination with the native app's hub integration. On the other hand Android's notification solution is not bad either and maybe blackberry could make their custom Hub-App for Android and - as I said - tweak Android to make it more productive. I'd also love to see Android-wear support, so >_< ah, it's so hard to decide."

I use it for work and go 8-7 using it to respond to emails, text, google things I don't know, and even sometimes remote into machines. BB Classic handles this fantastically. One thing you can do to improve the battery life is to limit your CPU performance. This at first seems idiotic, however, a majority of things you do during the day do not require your full CPU performance. Sending a text? Checking email? Updating social media? Highly doubtful you'd need all your CPU for this. Using resource hungry apps, yes, you probably would want all your power. To enable this, pull down the settings bar, slide to the right, click battery saving, ensure ""Limit Maximum CPU Performance"" is checked, adjust any other settings, then turn it on."

The classic = 9900 fused with q10. 1:1 screen , smaller form factor   Snapchat can be used via two methods either load a older version of the official android version or use a 3rd party developed version called Casper.  Snapchat is trying to lock everyone out that isn't using their official application. If you do get locked , you can login to www.snapchat.com/unlock to fix it.   The application situation between the two devices is essentially the same. You have the BlackBerry App World, amazon or snap or Google play store but anything that uses google services is practically useless.  As for Venice, since there are just speculations regarding what the device will be running, looks, specs. Heck AT&T might not even pick it up right away.

If you can wait on the Venice I would, but there is so little information on it I'm not sure its hype on the internet dictates any quality it may have. The app store is the same for the Classic and for the Passport. You have BB World as well as the Amazon App store.

If you are not aware of this it can eat up quite some data. Luckily this only happens at work for me and turns out the wifi there is crap xd"
blackberry,3ces5d,eddy_07,3,Tue Jul 7 18:01:33 2015 UTC,"Oh. I see. Yes, with low signals it keeps disconnecting. Also fixed for me on later 10.3.1 builds and gone completely on 10.3.2. The WiFi at my work is also crap. It would not stay connected to one bar. Now it does and acts exactly the same as Androids around me. This is why having to wait for carrier OS approval really hurts such a young OS as BB10. These bugs were fixed months ago and fairly quickly. I would like BlackBerry to open up their Beta program to more people so these things can be caught before being approved for official release. If you want to give it one more chance grab an autoloader from crackberry.com or n4bb.com and back up essential stuff. Start fresh. 10.3.2.2339 is the greatest on my Z30. If you don't want to give it one more chance I don't blame you man. Good luck."
blackberry,3ces5d,DassenLaw,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:13:57 2015 UTC,Extreme late reply :p but I wasn't OP just throwing 2 cents around. Not thinking about leaving still very content with my passport
blackberry,3ces5d,eddy_07,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:24:10 2015 UTC,Oh wow. Didn't even notice. That's cool. Just trying to help whether it's the OP or not.
blackberry,3ces5d,dufourgood,7,Tue Jul 14 23:30:10 2015 UTC,"I'm actually shocked to read all this.  I've had my Q10 for more than two years, and I've never had any issues since I got it.  I don't ever blame people for leaving, if that's what they feel is the cause, but remember that all devices have issues, and I'm hoping there's always a shorter solution for these issues.  Best of luck, and please tell me you're heading to Samsung / Android, and not iOS."
blackberry,3ces5d,XenonXZ,2,Tue Jul 7 12:45:11 2015 UTC,"Never had any issues, might be worth using different radio firmwares / running leaks."
blackberry,3ces5d,dessmond,2,Tue Jul 7 11:21:41 2015 UTC,wifi issues will be with us for ever! Since changed our ome wifi to the 5Gz band the number of problems have been reduced to near zero.
blackberry,3ces5d,bve21,2,Tue Jul 7 11:49:53 2015 UTC,Have you tried deleting the saved wifi networks and starting again? My wife had a wifi issue with hers and this plus a wifi toggle off/on fixed the connection issue. If that doesn't work its probably a hardware issue. No warranty on the device? Time for a Classic!
blackberry,3ces5d,bve21,2,Tue Jul 7 13:16:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Ive tried this before, didn't work."

blackberry,3ces5d,luv2hotdog,2,Tue Jul 7 13:26:26 2015 UTC,I had wifi issues on my Z30 once... turns out it was the router. Sad that you were't able to find a quick fix for this.
blackberry,3ces5d,engrbugs,2,Tue Jul 7 14:13:37 2015 UTC,"Since you're probably going to have the exact same issues with your new phone, I suggest you invest in a better wireless router, or at least replace your defective one."

blackberry,3ces5d,engrbugs,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:48:57 2015 UTC,I think im going with you mate. With my bb passport is so buggy. I think im going too. Bb should double check their quality before taking out ios and android

blackberry,3cbj15,EseJandro,2,Mon Jul 6 21:41:14 2015 UTC,"The 10.3.2 branch is mainly bug fixes and security related. You cannot downgrade to 10.3.1 now and BlackBerry Protect will turn your phone to a brick if it's stolen and password is put in wrong 10 times. You won't be able to unlock it from this state without the original BlackBerry ID and password.   Also, growing numbers on Calendar!  It's a smooth OS though. I'm on PassportSQW100-1/10.3.2.2339 and it's superb."

blackberry,3cbj15,supamonkey77,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:26:54 2015 UTC,It updated from 10.2. I bought my verizon-badged Z30 unlocked from eBay and use it on T-Mobile.
blackberry,3cbj15,Th3Gr3g,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:08:45 2015 UTC,Well I'm hopeful again. Thanks. But it doesn't make sense. My carrier (us based) doesn't carry this phone and I would update over the internet. You'd think people like me would get it first.
blackberry,3cbj15,xraj489,2,Tue Jul 7 20:52:26 2015 UTC,Got it on my Q10. Very nice.
blackberry,3cbj15,Raptor007,2,Tue Jul 7 13:14:10 2015 UTC,Just got it on my unlocked Verizon Z30 that I use on T-Mobile. Things are going OK... The Amazon Appstore app takes a while to open. Still playing with the new version. I came from 10.2.xx.
blackberry,3cbj15,radjewell,2,Tue Jul 7 18:14:46 2015 UTC,"I was a little surprised when my phone told me the update is mandatory.  First we can't roll back, and now we are forced to update?  I don't like this trend; it feels like Apple's walled garden approach, where the device dictates what you're allowed to do with it.  All that said, this build is working fine for my Classic on Verizon; it seems solid and fast."
blackberry,3cd94y,BlackBerryClassico,5,Tue Jul 7 00:30:50 2015 UTC,Why would you resort to a Q5 after having all those past phones?
blackberry,3cd94y,Andrichuk,3,Tue Jul 7 01:36:22 2015 UTC,Asking the real questions.
blackberry,3cd94y,duane534,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:49:55 2015 UTC,Still don't understand why someone would drop the awesome specs of a Passport for the Classic; it's not that much smaller.
blackberry,3cd94y,nottychz,3,Tue Jul 7 10:10:44 2015 UTC,As someone who just bought a Classic...that Passport keyboard didn't look too attractive. Maybe it's better once you get used to it? But the flat keys and reliance on software for symbols seemed like a weird compromise.
blackberry,3cd94y,TxdoHawk,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:17:34 2015 UTC,The Passport is definitely for someone who uses the gestures.
blackberry,3cd94y,duane534,2,Tue Jul 7 15:06:09 2015 UTC,"I sold the q10 due to lack of compatibility with BlackBerry bridge. Sold the Passport to my friend who kept saying he wanted one, and I wanted to use the cash to grab a motorcycle for my B-day. Plus I missed the tool belt."

blackberry,3cd94y,BPiece,2,Tue Jul 7 09:47:43 2015 UTC,"I prefer the Passport, since I had a Q10 and the classic wasn't different enough to warrant buying it though."
blackberry,3cd94y,heredia21,2,Tue Jul 7 09:48:35 2015 UTC,"It's not just a bigger screen and battery, the whole specs of the Passport are a long way ahead of those in the Classic.  Passport gets my vote (I've also had one since release, and am still loving it)"
blackberry,3cd94y,garcia85,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:12:34 2015 UTC,"Just ended up buying one, 500 with a case and the charging dock. I love the Classic but with all the gestures I find the track pad and buttons pretty useless. Love the keyboard though."

blackberry,3cc99j,koalillo,9,Mon Jul 6 20:02:06 2015 UTC,The Pebble smartwatch is working awesome for me. The Pro version of Talk2Watch was well worth the $5. AMA.
blackberry,3cc99j,WiFiForeheadWrinkles,3,Mon Jul 6 20:58:29 2015 UTC,Second this. Pebble is great.
blackberry,3cc99j,mcmanninc,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:38:14 2015 UTC,"Are there any other significant differences between the regular and the Pro versions aside from Caller ID?d  Which model Pebble are you using (is there any difference between the polycarbonate and steel models, aside from the material)? I may hold out for the Time, but want to see it in action before deciding..."
blackberry,3cc99j,BirdBruce,2,Mon Jul 6 21:45:04 2015 UTC,"You can access the Pebble store to install apps and watchfaces through Talk2Watch Pro so you don't have to use the Android app anymore. I think the sports work much better (via the ESPN app). I don't use this part but scripts seem a lot easier to use/create now.   I am using the original Pebble (black). There is not much of a different in terms of internal hardware; they both can only load up to 8 watchfaces/apps at one time. The Steel uses Gorilla glass and not plastic so there won't be distortion if you view it through different lenses (this mainly happens with sunglasses, but it's not a big enough of an issue for me to shell out for the Steel). Other than that, the Steel also has an added LED light so you know when you are charging. Here is a nice comparison of the tech specs.   I personally chose the OG Pebble for two reasons: one being the price (not worth the extra $100 for just an updated casing) and two, the watchbands. The OG Pebble is compatible with any standard 22mm watchband, but the Pebble Steel requires this thing called a SteelConnect for standard watchbands, or you have to order bands specially made for it.   The creator of Talk2Watch is working on getting the app to work with Pebble Time and as far as I know he has notifications, the app store, Timeline pins and music control working. I've messaged him a couple of times on CrackBerry for other minor issues and he responds really fast so I don't doubt that there will be future support. I've started saving up for a Pebble Time myself, but they're $250 in Canada."
blackberry,3cc99j,WiFiForeheadWrinkles,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:00:26 2015 UTC,"Incredibly helpful. I'm a sucker for a classic watch look, and the Steel definitely catches my eye, especially with a matching metal band. But the bit about the watchband is curious. Cheers for all the insight!"
blackberry,3cc99j,BirdBruce,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:05:03 2015 UTC,"Look into gadgetwraps. They're fairly cheap and have great customer service (you can even PM them here if you want: /u/gadgetwraps) if you want to change the look. I have the black carbon fibre one on my Pebble with a black metal watch band and I think it looks awesome. Here's someone who tried to make it all metal looking. IMO these are necessary, even if you get the all clear one, because the plastic Pebble scratches easily."

blackberry,3cc99j,WiFiForeheadWrinkles,2,Tue Jul 7 15:57:43 2015 UTC,"Basically it looks like this when I get a notification. You can turn texts/calls/FB/etc on and off to your liking but cannot filter by contact. EDIT: I take that part back. If you highlight the people you want to filter by as ""favourite"" contacts, you can go into Talk2Watch Pro and just select ""favourite contacts"" and only those will be pushed to your watch. Haven't tried it but just took a peeksie into the app.   The only thing is Whatsapp is not supported because they haven't released the API. The workaround for this is to install Hub2Watch. This will show how many messages per account that are unread but you will not be able to read the messages themselves."

blackberry,3c98hx,kryptkpr,8,Mon Jul 6 11:24:40 2015 UTC,"Former BB employee here, there are very strict guidelines about what you are allowed to do with a prototype device.  Rule #1 is to avoid use in public places (cover the phone with your hand if you have to take a call), and rule #2 is to never leave prototype devices unattended.  Giving it to someone else to 'try' is a big no-no, definitely broke NDA here."

blackberry,3c98hx,69hailsatan,10,Mon Jul 6 17:06:18 2015 UTC,8mp on the front makes me think this is highly unlikely.  Even most phones now only use 5mp front cameras
blackberry,3c98hx,knightfallzx2,3,Tue Jul 7 04:53:18 2015 UTC,LG G4 is 8mp up front.
blackberry,3c98hx,69hailsatan,0,Mon Jul 6 03:20:13 2015 UTC,"very rare case though, even the s6 doesn't even have it.  For bb to pack real current specs, hell would freeze before that happens"

blackberry,3c98hx,deadrag3,2,Tue Jul 7 06:40:55 2015 UTC,"so because the selfie game is just extending to the 8mp cameras it is unlikely of the bb to have one. sorry but you don't make a point at this moment. the fact is, more and more smartphones that get released have an 8 mp front shooter and the likelihood of the new bb having one isn't all that bad.  Oh and FYI, there are actually quite a lot phones with 8mp front but mostly they are Chinese mediatek devices that nearly lag when you only reach for them, however the Xiaomi m4 and the desire 808 are quite challengers with the front cam."

You are weighing apples with pears anyway and I even went along with that. Bb is a completely different system and tbh just because the ""kings"" don't have it, a simple ""farmer"" could still have it."
blackberry,3c98hx,maakar,3,Tue Jul 7 07:34:19 2015 UTC,That sounds interesting. Still I hope they will release two versions of this phone. One with Android and second with BB10.

A friend of mine works for BlackBerry. When I indicated my interest in the Passport a while back, he told me to specifically wait till Fall. I told him I don't care if its an upgraded phone, newer phones will always have better specs. I had the Z10 and I wasn't too fond of the touch screen only. He knew then I had the Torch and hated it, so a slider wasn't my favourite form factor.  I tried to pry him for more information, I laid out the reasons why I didn't much care for a faster BB in other form factors. All he kept repeating was that I should wait till Fall.   And then in the MWC, Chen held up the Venice slider and I was pretty disappointed. Yeah it had a curved screen, but he knew I wasn't that crazy about things like that. I didn't think about it later until the Android rumours started coming out. One thing he always knew was my app frustration with BB10. But at the time I was talking to him, I never imagined Android on the BB in any capacity, so I never questioned him on that angle.   All of this has gotten me thinking. I have no proof of this because I'm obviously not going to reveal my friends identity or his role. Honestly, I don't know if it was Android that he was alluding to, or something else entirely. Just a very interesting conversation that I've been thinking a lot recently."

Samsung and other big android manufacturers have tried quite a bit but fact is, Android is a much heavier OS compared to BB.  Let's see how it goes, I'm rooting for them.

blackberry,3c98hx,minusSeven,3,Tue Jul 7 03:30:04 2015 UTC,Hub? Please tell me we didn't lose the hub.
blackberry,3c98hx,stoneeus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:03:16 2015 UTC,"If this is all real and they release a phone with skinned Android on it, I suspect Hub will exist but it will be neutered. Probably just an email client with sms built in.They could leave hooks for other apps to integrate but they would have to get those apps to buy in and if you are making that pitch to developers they are going to think, how many of these are going to sell? Is it worth building it in? Also, since people will setup gmail initially for Google Play Services and Blackberry will have to ship with Gmail and Hangougs (the SMS alternative), will anyone even ever use hub?  So what I'm saying is, expect Blackberry to have a ""Hub"" but don't expect to ever see Hub in the form that it is on BB10, even if they were to work it in to the launcher."

If I can't get both these things in a BB device, why would I bother, regardless of OS?"
blackberry,3c98hx,knightfallzx2,4,Mon Jul 6 19:48:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for this.  I had been thinking about battery life on it and speculating the slide-out keyboard would cut into the space available for the battery. Hopefully the final version will at least be on par with the S6.
blackberry,3c98hx,Linegod,4,Mon Jul 6 20:01:08 2015 UTC,The OS... its multilayered. It’s android but its first layer is BlackBerry. Basically your phone is running Lollipop with BlackBerry’s security features added.   This makes no sense.
blackberry,3c98hx,fixed_that_for_me,10,Mon Jul 6 02:43:23 2015 UTC,"Translation: BlackBerry has its own skin/launcher running on it. It really isn't hard to imagine, looking at what HTC, Samsung, etc. do. Some skins/launchers completely change the feel of the device."
blackberry,3c98hx,garcia85,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:04:10 2015 UTC,Skin is not the same as launcher. Skins modify the look and feel of the OS and add new features. Launcher is only for accessing your apps. You can change your launcher with ease by downloading one from the store but changing your skin required more technical knowledge.
blackberry,3c98hx,gintoddic,2,Mon Jul 6 06:36:37 2015 UTC,I think the first layer is a bit deeper than the launcher or the skin. The first layer is the kernel.
blackberry,3c98hx,Medfried,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:00:05 2015 UTC,"Manufacturers often ""skin"" Android to make it their devices more unique. Samsung added TouchWiz. LG G4 has it's own skin. HTC adds what they call Sense. Sony changes some stuff too.  Motorola is one of very few who doesn't do much at all to Android and keeps the OS looking ""stock"".  I always assumed BlackBerry would add things and ""bake"" it into the Android OS to make their phone(s) more... BlackBerry. This will be a good or bad thing. Depends who you talk to and what each user prefers."
blackberry,3c98hx,Medfried,4,Mon Jul 6 11:27:46 2015 UTC,"I understand what a skin is.  My point is that he says the first layer is Blackberry.   Then he says that it is running Lollipop with Blackberrys security features added.  Which is it?   Is it Android with some Blackberry features added on, or is it a QNX bootloader, running Android in a container with a skin?  Or is is one of the two none-of-the-aboves:   bullshit QNX bootloader, complete Android instance, plus additional Blackberry security features."
blackberry,3c98hx,pbeaul,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:24:49 2015 UTC,"QNX bootloader, complete Android instance, plus additional Blackberry security features.   Good guess."

blackberry,3c98hx,HumanWasteland,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:23:39 2015 UTC,its probably running a stripped down version of BB with only security features enabled. Android probably runs in some kind of container on top of that as the actual GUI for the user.
blackberry,3c98hx,sheepsix,2,Mon Jul 6 22:53:58 2015 UTC,"I recognize you, John Chen."
blackberry,3c98hx,HumanWasteland,2,Tue Jul 7 13:10:37 2015 UTC,I'd trust this guy based on the numbers of leaks we've seen recently. And John Chen was setting up grounds for Android based BlackBerry. BlackBerry might've found a half cooked prototype level OS for Venice. Who knows?!
blackberry,3c98hx,garcia85,-1,Mon Jul 6 02:22:07 2015 UTC,Don’t trust me based on the leaks. Trust me because I was physically holding it in my hand.
blackberry,3c98hx,sheepsix,9,Mon Jul 6 03:42:15 2015 UTC,"Are there pictures of you holding it? If not, who are you and why should people trust you?  I held one too, though it was running BB10 and it was amazing... Trust me. I might be lying"
blackberry,3c98hx,garcia85,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:49:50 2015 UTC,"The photos of Venice from Mobile World Congress show that it's certainly not running Android.  If in fact this isn't entirely made up, then OP held some sort of testing platform.  I seriously doubt the phone will be released with Android."
blackberry,3c98hx,sheepsix,2,Mon Jul 6 04:13:12 2015 UTC,"The Venice they showed at MWC wasn't running anything, it was almost certainly a shell with a light and a picture of the BB10 screen to give the appearance of a working device. It's fairly clear between these two pictures here and here (notice how you can still see everything on screen in the first picture before he opens it up), but also this bit."
blackberry,3c98hx,garcia85,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:11:47 2015 UTC,I cannot dispute your assertion and I didn't even consider that it might be just a backlit transparency.  Part of my point still stands in that if it was intended to run Android would they not then have an Android transparency in the mock up.  Good catch btw.
blackberry,3c98hx,Medfried,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:30:42 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. They clearly just wanted to tease a device, so they kept the focus on that. It could still be that they are only ""playing around"" with the idea though, but don't currently have concrete intentions on releasing an Android phone."

blackberry,3c98hx,zed011,2,Mon Jul 6 22:57:30 2015 UTC,"That's the thing though. There's no need. Just be open to the possibility that this thing exists. It's not completely farfetched.   Maybe I, along with a bunch of other Android users want this thing to be real because we know we'll order it the first chance we get."
blackberry,3c98hx,minusSeven,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:08:04 2015 UTC,"Ok, I guess we misunderstand each other.  I'm not closed to the possibility that someday there might be a BB running Android and I won't speak to whether that should happen or not.  What I'm saying here is that putting everything I know about BB into a pot and stirring it around, what comes out is my semi-educated guess that this device will not be released running Android and that either OP is completely full of BS or what he held is some sort of testing platform.  I have trouble trusting OP's competence because of other comments he has made in this sub.  An example of which where he said he did a wipe/reinstall and lost all his contacts.  I was shocked to read about a BB user not knowing how to sync contacts.  I thought only iPhone users lost contacts because the ones I know don't understand the concept of syncing or backing up anything.  That said, as an Android user, why would you order a BB running Android the first chance you get?  Is it because of the physical keyboard? That's the only reason I can think of as, while I like the devices, I don't feel that they are of superior build quality to other offerings out there.  The reason I use BB is because of the OS and how messaging is baked in. I have an Android tablet which duplicates the email addresses on my BB and I have yet to find a solution that even comes close to what OS10 delivers out of the box.  Cheers!"
blackberry,3c98hx,jlit0,3,Tue Jul 7 00:59:00 2015 UTC,"It's possible OP is just a casual user who got lucky enough to spend a few minutes with this slider phone. I'd completely dismiss it if there were no renders of the phone or if evleaks never released any information about it (I hear he's a pretty reliable source)  That's pretty much it. I need a physical keyboard. I do just fine using an on screen keyboard but I miss those days of being able to use a physical one.   If blackberry released a regular touch screen running android, I'd probably just shrug my shoulders and go about my business but, a blackberry with a physical keyboard running android would be sweet."

blackberry,3c98hx,Qikdraw,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:11:30 2015 UTC,"I have no idea. I didn’t even ask him. I assume that as far as mobile devices go (phones, specifically) will not last too much longer. As we can see, we’re now having BlackBerry with Android on it.  However, I think they’ll keep themselves afloat in their QNX and Enterprise stuff for businesses.  Basically, I don’t think the consumer portion of BlackBerry will be around much longer. Just my opinion."

With an imminent release date as well, I'm extremely doubtful that it's buggy and has poor battery life. The time to prototype is over.

We just don't have an official way to do it.   Besides, this method doesn't allow us to get paid apps anyway.   There's also the fact that if an app is free, and works, it should be available anyway.   Furthermore, I'd still prefer to use BB10 over Android even if I couldn't use android apps. Cause it doesn't suck ass.   Here is the thing, I like Android, it's a nice OS. On my tablet, that I don't care if I have to wipe every 2 months cause it turns into laggy garbage.

blackberry,3c1iar,spark_soul,6,Fri Jul 3 22:12:21 2015 UTC,"Regular BBM messages are not end-to-end encrypted but are encrypted in transit, so it's secure against random snooping but not against BlackBerry themselves, anyone with access to the servers, or anyone who can compel BlackBerry to hand over your messages.  BBM Protected is end-to-end encrypted, so even BlackBerry themselves can't read your messages, but doesn't have forward-secrecy, so if the keys are compromised every message encrypted with that key can be read (in a system with forward-secrecy, messages are encrypted with temporary keys that are discarded so if the primary keys are compromised they can't be used to decrypt messages)."
blackberry,3c1iar,oxychromaticdynamite,3,Sat Jul 4 13:16:48 2015 UTC,"Anyone who really cares, please read the document at the following link. http://bit.ly/1IZXXzi  If you do, you'll discover a few things that contradict what many posters in here have said: 1. All BBM apps, on any platform, encrypt in transit using TLS 2. Between BlackBerry devices, there is a second layer of encryption, Triple DES 168bit... But on Android and iOS and Windows the first layer, TLS, is still there 3. The encryption key is global. PLEASE don't mistake ""global"" for ""public"". No one outside of BlackBerry has this key, but it is one master key for all the BlackBerry-to-BlackBerry encryption layer. 4. On Android and iOS, the database of chats is encrypted as well, using SQLCipher. This prevents remote hackers from snooping into your messages, as they'll find that the internal message storage is encrypted.  This is all for REGULAR BBM, and NOT BBM Protected. BBM Protected takes things to the next level, but 99% of the people here aren't gonna use it because you pay for it. So, sticking with regular BBM, the moral of the story is that it IS encrypted, both in transit as well as on the device memory. And yes, the key is global, meaning BlackBerry can decrypt your messages if they want (ex. The notable Indian Gov't case). However, ""global"" key here doesn't mean any shmuck with a bit of hacking wherewith can get that key and start intercepting your messages. Far from it."
blackberry,3c1iar,campbecw,2,Mon Jul 6 07:00:42 2015 UTC,"And I have to add one more thing, and that's that the global key only applies to chats between BlackBerry devices. Such a global key doesn't affect iOS, Android or Windows at all."

blackberry,3c1iar,funforfire,13,Fri Jul 3 23:27:31 2015 UTC,"Wrong.

blackberry,3c1iar,campbecw,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:01:27 2015 UTC,"I've read the relevant and current document. Nothing has changed. When using standard BBM, messages are encrypted with a key that every BlackBerry device has access to and so is able to decrypt those messages:   Each device uses the same global BBM encryption key, which BlackBerry adds to the device during the manufacturing process   The only reason this doesn't matter is because no one can get the encrypted messages as the ciphertext itself is encrypted in transit using TLS.  My guess is the only reason they even bother using the key is because it makes it easier to integrate with BBM Protected where you can change the key."
blackberry,3c1iar,oxychromaticdynamite,2,Mon Jul 6 11:37:51 2015 UTC,"This setup has been around since before BBM Protected. And the key that is on the device is not accessible. So no, not everyone has it, and not anyone can get it, and no everyone can hack your BBMs. So, if the TLS encryption was hacked, then this other layer of security is still there and still relevant (at least on BlackBerry devices). This makes it superior to other messaging apps that may have one layer of encryption (and generally not as intense as TLS), or none!"
blackberry,3c1iar,campbecw,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:42:04 2015 UTC,the key that is on the device is not accessible   So the phone decrypts the incoming messages how? Magic? Every BlackBerry device is capable of decrypting any BBM encrypted with that key.   This makes it superior to other messaging apps that may have one layer of encryption   It is inferior to WhatsApp and iMessage where users have their own private keys.  I'm starting to suspect that you don't understand how encryption works.
blackberry,3c1iar,oxychromaticdynamite,2,Mon Jul 6 16:58:23 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to suspect you don't understand how BBM works. We are talking about hackers, here. If a hacker tried to intercept a BBM, they don't have the decryption key. Yes, the key lives on a BlackBerry device, but that part of the BlackBerry device is inaccessible to the public. So, again, don't confuse ""global key"" with ""public key"". Not any schmuck can pick up a BlackBerry device, root it, get into the secure partitions, find the global key, extract it, and then start applying it to in-transit messaging. And let's assume someone did, then they'd be faced with TLS, which is secure enough to do your banking on, let alone send your dick pics.   Even Blackphone took a crack at BBM (though, granted, only the Android and iOS version of the app), and found that it was secured against in-transit interception. So, if the single-layer encryption of that version of BBM is adequate to protect against in-transit attacks, then how does adding a second layer... even a global key layer, make that somehow less secure?  The original response to the OP was someone who said BBM is NOT secure. I see evidence that it is."

Things to do: hard reset, like the old battery pull, hold volume up and volume down at the same time for 5 seconds and it will reset your phone, some people have had to do multiple resets to get an OS build comfortable.  Head over to crackberry.com and look at their beta OS builds, I am running 10.3.2.440 and it is stable, fast and easier on the battery than 10.3.1.x.

It is daunting at first but this being my sixth blackberry and never having bricked a phone while updating the OS (knock on wood) it really isn't that bad. At&t is notoriously slow at releasing operating system upgrades on blackberry and this way you are six months ahead of everyone else with a passport on at&t.

I had the exact same issue and I scratched my head over it for days before realizing I was over thinking it.   Consider this: the ""consolidate/forward/reply-as"" technique was never a ""feature"" of Gmail. It was a workaround to not being able to log into two accounts in the same browser session. But we got used to it and went from living WITH it to living BY it.  So when you migrate over to BlackBerry, you bring along the mentality that that's how things should be. But what you're able to do instead is actually run all three of your email addresses separately and simultaneously without the need for forwarding and replying-as.  It takes a minute to get used to the simplicity of it, but once you do, you'll never look back."

blackberry,3c0546,BirdBruce,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:28:36 2015 UTC,I haven't tried it yet on BlackBerry but FoxFi is a rock solid Android work around for AT&T. I don't think you'll find it on Play Store/Snap; pretty sure you have to sideload the apk directly from the developer's site (found easily enough with a quick search).
blackberry,3c0546,luv2hotdog,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:50:28 2015 UTC,I got lucky - Optus in Australia are one of the few carriers here who want extra money for wifi hotspots and they block the functionality in iphones... but they let blackberries do it!   I actually didn't know they could block it on a BB. My suggestion would be the android app Foxfi but I have no idea if the android runtime would allow it to create a hotspot... Worth a shot though? Good luck!

So if items are showing up there it's because they are within synced folders.  When you file things to an unsynced folder it usually gives you a popup asking whether or not you want to enable folder synchronization for the unsynced folder. There's a ""Don't ask this again"" option, so if you selected don't ask again and chose to enable it I'm guessing it would behave like you're describing.  You can re-enable the popup here: Hub Settings -> Display and Actions -> Notify when folder isn't synced so that you can manually select yes/no each time or change the default action."

blackberry,3bxw7f,bacon_reader_user,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:08:58 2015 UTC,"Isn't this all just wild speculation at this point? I may have missed something but I have seen zero evidence that BlackBerry are releasing an Android phone soon. And as /u/mrturretman already noted the CEO has already made a statement which at best tells us a BlackBerry Android is a while away yet (pending work on security systems). Ignoring the mock-up (photoshopped) image above, which has nothing to do with the phone being discussed in the article, I have seen one real-looking leaked picture of a Passport running Android. And all that really tells us is that someone at BlackBerry is working on running Android on their hardware, which is hardly surprising and doesn't really tell us anything new. I'm just as interested as the next guy to see what BlackBerry may offer in the Android department, and I'd even buy one if it doesn't require me to agree to Google's terms and conditions, but for now I hope the next handset is a BB10 slider, and I'd be surprised if it's not."

blackberry,3bxw7f,pbeaul,2,Fri Jul 3 15:43:35 2015 UTC,"Says who? Where's the proof?  Google has an EXTREMELY tight grip over what oems can/can't do once they sign the OHA/MADA contracts. There are tons of hurdles in front of BlackBerry before it's even in a position to comply with most of those rules.  The reality is, if BlackBerry does go android it will signal the end of their hardware division. I don't buy that there are so many people on Android starving for a physical keyboard (edit: that they're willing to pay a premium for)... If a viable/profitable market existed, so would a device.  The Android marketplace is incredibly crowded and cut throat, things are only going to get worse as smart phones become even more of a commodity and $35 Chinese handsets become available. Pretty much all Android OEMs are struggling to make a profit. How is BlackBerry going to make any money in that environment?  I'm not skeptical or disappointed, just realistic... So again, I'll believe it when I see it."
blackberry,3bxw7f,iPoop20,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:23:32 2015 UTC,"Well, the simple answer to your question, and probably the main reason Google is working with BlackBerry, is security. Google is losing to iOS in enterprise in the US, BlackBerry has already shown it can secure Android via BES. How they'll secure Android hardware for regular consumers without BES? We don't know. But Chen hinted at that, and it's definitely coming. There have been rumors from employees at BlackBerry posted on Crackberry too. And from the way Chen answered that question on CNBC after the recent ER, I'd be willing to bet a lot of money that the Android BlackBerry is coming. It's a matter of time.   No one does physical keyboards and security as well as BlackBerry. If Google teams up with them on devices, BlackBerry's hardware division will most certainly remain viable. That's a huge market to tap into, especially considering Google's advertising power and their desire to become more competitive in enterprise mobility.   But literally anything would give BlackBerry a better chance of maintaining a hardware division compared to their current course of action. Just look at handset (especially bb10 estimates) sales from the past 2 years. There's NO way their handset business survives if it continues its current trajectory. Which sucks, because BlackBerry10 is in my opinion the most efficient mobile OS out there. Sadly, no one cares."

Some apps on google play store need support for google play services, those apps won't work on blackberry(mostly google apps like chrome etc, maps work though). But apps on amazon app store won't need google play services so those work perfectly. Also amazon gives a lot of paid apps for free from time to time some of them are really good.

Secondly, the fact that you NEED certain Android apps to work FOR WORK makes the decision a no-brainer. If you worked construction and your foreman said ""I need you to bring your own hammer,"" would you bring a pipe wrench and say ""Well, it's heavy and I can hit things with it, so good enough, right?"" Of course not. Get the tool you need, and then get the best version of that tool that you can afford and/or justify."
blackberry,3bnd3s,BirdBruce,5,Tue Jun 30 22:21:34 2015 UTC,Doesn't the leap have some low end specs? This being a blackberry sub reddit I'm sure you'll hear nothing but praise about the blackberry. Why not the Passport since that thing is pretty snappy?  I personally use a Note 4 with 128 SD card and an extra battery just incase. I won't sway you to go Android or blackberry. Sure there might be a bit of a learning curve but I think it's worth it in the end.   I've been itching to try out the classic or just wait it out until that slider comes out. Goodluck with your decision!

blackberry,3bnd3s,KneebarKing,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:25:53 2015 UTC,Android isn't the glamorous system everyone makes it out to be.  I've done the switch from bb7 to bb10 to Android and back with the BB Passport.  It was wonderful to have the physical keyboard. I still have the S4 as a gaming device.
blackberry,3bnd3s,repairbills,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:19:52 2015 UTC,"The S6 is pretty and the hardware specs leave the Leap for dust. But if you look at the pure productivity of the devices for everyday use, the Hub on Leap, Z30 or Z10 will beat Android, iOS and Windows Phone. There is an app gap, IMO - I understand from a friend with a Passport that Android app execution speed is comparable with a native Android phone, but on my Z30 it isn't. Some apps are better than others however and your experience may be fine on a Z or Leap. There is one thing you might not have considered: a low-end Android to run the work stuff you can't do on the Blackberry and a nice new BlackBerry (Passport probably as it has the best current specs) for everything else.  Edit: grammar."

blackberry,3bnd3s,OrionGrant,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:10:26 2015 UTC,"The Leap is just a repackaged Z10 with less features but a bigger screen, Z30 is superior in nearly every way and cheaper so if you want all touch BlackBerry I'd say go Z30.   After that it really comes down to whether you want an expensive top of the line phone vs an affordable capable phone. Purely specs wise the S6 is by far better but in actual everyday performance you probably wouldn't notice too much.   If you do go the Android route I'd recommend looking into the S5 if you want Samsung because it actually has more features than the S6, is still plenty powerful and it's significantly cheaper. It has waterproofing, a removable battery, SD card slot and more that Samsung decided just wasn't worth the hassle."
blackberry,3bnd3s,drywallq,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:06:15 2015 UTC,"Honest opinion, Passport.... yea, we all like a touch screen. My Z10 sits on a shelf as a backup. Girlfriend just had to use it this past week due to the common problem of the Iphone 6 screen going bad... with android lollipop, as my coworkers say, they designed the os and called it that, so users could ""suck it"". Samsung has a lot to offer, but the OS is just a limp Google. I haven't had a problem with the passport myself, looked into the leap, and it just doesn't have the hardware specs I want to upgrade to. Personal opinion is once you have the blackberry OS, and how easy it is to use once you get the hang of it, it's like driving a standard. Dead pedal is uncomfortable, and looking for the clutch is a pain on automatic, but find yourself looking for it when driving on autopilot. I use an iphone 6 for work, and find myself spacing to it for ""wtf was I doing?"" more then I ever do my blackberry. Do what you feel man!! I just don't see the future much brighter then black anyway you put it at the moment"
blackberry,3bnd3s,Supergrunged,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:36:54 2015 UTC,What are the apps you need at work ? Also I am not fully sure about apps that don't have blackberry support since in enterprises there are usually always have blackberry alternatives. Actually 5 years back most companies used to have support only for blackberry. Times have changed but even today there is plenty of support for blackberry.   Also most android apps work rather well except google ones so I am not fully sure of what app you are talking about.
blackberry,3bnd3s,minusSeven,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:53:47 2015 UTC,"Man, an S6 is infinite times better than a Leap. It'd be hard to convince you when your choices are the best Android has to offer and a device from the bottom rungs of BB10."

I loved the Passport don't get me wrong, but I had two of them suffer from detached screens so when I got my refund from Amazon minus the restocking fee I just went for a Z30. I absolutely love the Z30 and can see why it won so many awards. I also feel it is the last pure BlackBerry since it was their last major release before the new leadership came in.   The sound quality is amazing and the screen while not as crisp as the Passport is no slouch. And after getting used to a full touch screen losing the ability to rotate into landscape always bugged me with the Passport. Both amazing phones but I like the Z30 more."

If it's in your pocket and gets torqued (not hard with how massively wide it is) the screen can get detached before the glue cools and sets. I tried to be a lot more careful with my replacement, and it lasted two extra months over the original. Instead of getting a third I went with the Z30."
blackberry,3blo62,jcraig3k,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:35:51 2015 UTC,"I got my Z10 the day it came out in Canada. Recently, I upgraded to a Z30 from my Z10 but went back mainly due the the screen size.  It's hard to use one handed (typing, swiping gestures - especially swiping down from the top) compared to the Z10 (which is the perfect size for a full touch screen ever imo)  Also, snapchat - can't set it up with a new BlackBerry, so as long as I don't logout of my Z10 I can use it.  The battery life is amazing though, I have multiple Z10 batteries that I switch, I can't get through a day without switching at least once anymore.  Right now I'm trying to sell my nearly-new Z30 to try out a classic, which also seems to hit the size sweet spot."

blackberry,3bi41g,onorua,2,Mon Jun 29 12:17:35 2015 UTC,"Technically, every BlackBerry 10 device is provisioned to use basic BlackBerry 10 Services (BBM being the main one) over WiFi.  You can take a device out of the box, turn it on with no SIM, and should be able to use WiFi.  If you have one of the very few outlier wireless carriers (one carrier in Canada comes to mind), if you did not provision your device with a ""BlackBerry Data Plan"" BB10 services would not work over cellular networks.  This was NOT a choice of BlackBerry, this was a choice of the carrier, and how they routed your traffic to BlackBerry.  BlackBerry did everything they could to encourage carriers to switch to the new model (I can't explain how it works due to confidentiality agreements), but some carriers decided to ignore it, and still kept their old model of billing, because without SAF, they could sell you a BlackBerry data plan, and not have to pay a penny to BlackBerry to take the profit for themselves."

My girlfriend was on the same carrier as well, and did not have any problem with BBM. So in some time I had technical engineers of my carrier on phone and blackberry representative on another one and both of them claimed the problem is on other side, and I do not see any reason to lie to me my core network friends, but I do see why it was BlackBerry, because it started to work after BBM update."

blackberry,3bi41g,eddy_07,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:44:16 2015 UTC,"Before a certain update(I think it was after 4.0) Android would always use more and more space on the internal memory because the system lacked some basic functions. Also, 4.4 brought a sudden performance boost. Still I'm planning to switch to a Passport later this year. Looks like no other phone on the market is suited better for me, and I really like some concepts and features of BB10."
blackberry,3bi41g,Boilerkim,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:42:55 2015 UTC,BlackBerry needs money to survive. Use these micropayments to support them. They will give you something back when they are not on the verge of bankruptcy anymore.
blackberry,3bi41g,dotisinjail,6,Mon Jun 29 15:28:07 2015 UTC,"To OP's point, as a BBRY phone owner, you are supporting them a whole lot more than a measly microtransaction. These features should be included in BB10 by default to make the phones more appealing, bringing people to buy their devices, increasing their stake in the cell phone user base.  Not a $1 microtransaction for their most supportive user base.  One of the strongest (non business) answers to the question ""why choose a blackberry phone?"" was BBM. Now it's cross platform, and there are few features of it in BB10 that differ from BBM on a droid phone.  Microtransactions are a smart business move. But IMO not to their own supporters."

Ive had some succcess with cleaning the out with a very fine pin or needle. Ill bend the tip ever so slightly and spool it around in there like im pulling hair out a sink. You should probably take your battery out or something just in case.  Edit: i should also mention ive had success with this on all my older blackberries also so its worth a shot. The lint will block the conection.  Tl;dr you might have some shit in your hole. Clean it.

I suspect that the 1-hour timeout is also an IT restriction There is an app that you can use to customise your home screen, though if you are looking for Android-style resizable widgets, you will likely be disappointed.   All that said, don't let those things put you off the device; I have found BB10 to be the most productive phone OS I have ever used (due in large part to the hub and not having to open all the apps individually). I would strongly recommend that you take the time to get used to the hub; to my mind it's what gives the phone its productivity edge. I chose BlackBerry as my personal phone coming from an iPhone, and wouldn't go back unless I had to. I have used Android devices before and my current work phone is Windows 8.1 and, for me, my Z30 (similar specs to your Leap) simply lets me get things done faster.  Good luck!"

If you go to the Hub, open up that same side menu and choose text or BBM accounts, you'll see the same stuff as when you go through the text or BBM icons. Not as far as I know, no. But you can get rid of the ""show wallpaper only"" page when you close apps. Hold the app icon and they should all be flashing. You can delete all those with the tiny garbage can in the corner.

blackberry,3bc3fz,eddy_07,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:29:52 2015 UTC,"The hub has a menu (three lines bottom left) that displays the accounts individually. Only BBM has a separate app. Everything else takes you to the individual page in the hub. I would suggest going through the options to see what suits you. What would you like in the hub and what would you like individually. You will still get notifications if the account is set to not show in hub.  The home screen can be turned off in display options. This only means when there are no apps open the home screen defaults to the first page of apps. I actually leave it. The system doesn't necessarily know what you want to do next. Hub to the left or open an app on the right. When you do have apps open, the open apps become the homepage because it is the focal point i.e. things you're working on. It's not really an extra step to me. It allows me to switch between open apps quickly.  Refer to your IT dept. on this one. They may have been instructed to set a high security setting to force password locks every hour for some reason. If not then get them to change the setting and maybe see if it can be done company wide if that level of security isn't needed. If it is then tough luck.  When you hold an app icon they all start wiggling and you can delete the ones with a trash icon. You should know this. But what to do with those pesky ones with no trash icon you ask? Put them in a folder called ""system"" or ""crap"" or ""stuff"" and throw it on the last app page somewhere. Then proceed to forget about it. This is not something unique to BB10 devices."

It's been 2.5 years about since BlackBerry first unveiled their 2 amazing phones that a lot of us still use today.  Looking back and looking at now though lets list some things that changed and some things that have still not been addressed.  Changes:   BlackBerry Assistant, it's more than just a simple voice command, it's actually something worth competing with Siri, Google now and Cortana Android run time, we are now able to easily download android apps and close the app gate that we were so limited to, as well we also do get the amazon app store pre-installed, and the official play store is easily downloadable with most google services apps now not being an issue. Blend, through our pc or another tablet, we can now just send and receive emails and other messages without even having to look at our phones anymore, now we don't have to peek at our phones every 5 seconds Picture pattern, weather its Google's dot pattern or just a simple 4 digit code, or even a complex word, all of these can easily be remembered, if someone see's your phone multiple times, they can eventually figure out what your code is, but its a lot more difficult with the picture pattern as you'll first need to figure out which number it is and then where the location is, on top of that the numbers are rearranged differently every single time App store is actually decent, it has some pretty big games in there and a lot of built for Blackberry apps, its no where near as great as iOS but its leagues ahead of Windows Connectivity we can actually connect to things such as fitbits now which weren't really meant to be connected with a Blackberry device in the first place. Kind of only for flagships but speakers, the Z30 and now the Passport have some of the loudest speakers I've seen on a mobile device and they were smart enough not to put the speakers on the back of the phone. The Hub has seen some enhancements as well, with being able to directly delete a message or notification with one button, or pinching to filter all unread messages.   Things that still need to be addressed:   Maps, it gets the job done most of the time, but its still no where are great as Google, Apple, or Bing maps. The location you want to go to is just a general location, when you make a turn, it takes a while for it to load so if you had to make another immediate turn you probably would miss it. Camera,  it's decent but still no where close to other flagships like the S6, iPhone6, LG G4, Xperia Z3+, and the software is very very very bad and slow.   Those are just the ones that I thought up from the top of my head, what about you guys?"

Google now is a different program that came about after the default Android speech to text assistant and it does a lot of stuff Siri, Cortana, and BlackBerry Assistant don't do. There is no current competitor for that service and there won't be for a long time.   Why?  Because Now incorporates your activity across every device you own and all of your searches and emails, along with Google's deep understanding of natural queries, search, and latent semantics.   BlackBerry and Apple don't have access to any of that information, and so few people use MS search and mail products that they don't have the sample size and databases of information that Google has.   It's far more than simple speech to text recognition like we see with BlackBerry Assistant and Siri and it can't be replicated without those immense multi-device, multi-channel databases."

Do you really think the same amount of people are on the android side?  I'd say no, I'm willing to bet only a couple thousand android users actually want a blackberry phone  2) Am I opposed to the idea? No, I love android I just bought an xperia tab z4 and great, love it for playing games and such but for surfing the net and handling notification it sucks compared to bb10  3) money, blackberry doesn't have a lot of money so they cant do big gambles, if they release a low end phone it must be cheap and when I say cheap I mean 100-150 but it also has to have decent specs and when I say decent it has to be on par with the z30 in terms of atleast processing power, I mean look at the moto g, if not they have nothing going for them, high end, theyre fighting against Samsung, lg, sony, htc who everyone know already, its a crowded battlefield"
blackberry,3bb9yf,minusSeven,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:11:03 2015 UTC,"Pie in the sky, but I'd love to see some waterproofing like the xperia Z line. Blackberries always feel indestructible anyway (at least the qwerty ones) and this would just set that in stone, the whole ""it's a tool you use, not something you need to take care of"" vibe.  I would LOVE a better camera. I went from the xperia z2 to the passport and I'm happy not to be using google's services anymore I miss that incredible camera. the Passport is way better than any blackberry i've had before in this regard and since a software update came along it stopped being slow to focus and shoot, but it still falls behind.   I don't think it's a feature that anyone looks for but every bb10 device i've used has been very good as an audio recorder. That's been a really useful feature for me - it can record loud stuff like a band rehearsal session that's proper loud without distorting.  Negatives - Blackberry assistant is cool but I wish there was an opt out for it, I miss the ""instant actions"" of 10.2 which seemed to have simpler software that stayed out of the way more. I'm not at all inclined to speak commands to my phone and I've found the instant-action typing commands to be less efficient with assistant."

blackberry,3ayj5v,Nimiety_One,3,Wed Jun 24 21:14:48 2015 UTC,"having a phone isn't a popularity contest   It kind of is though! I find myself getting defensive all the time when friends and family jump on me for using Blackberry. I've exclusively had Blackberrys since 2007-ish. I got a Z10 almost 2 years ago and several close friends and family members are already making suggestions assuming I'm ready to 'give up' the Blackberry to move on to something 'better,' since I will soon be eligible for an upgrade with my carrier. It annoys me enough that I'll probably stick with Blackberry just to spite them. j/k I've always liked Blackberry and have never found a compelling reason to switch to something else."
blackberry,3ayj5v,greenkey901,2,Thu Jun 25 13:15:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've always loved ""strange"" or not often seen phones, though I do love the Note 4 quite a bit as well.   I'll stick with my Classic for two years and see where it takes me."
blackberry,3ayj5v,Nimiety_One,2,Thu Jun 25 18:36:14 2015 UTC,I love how users ignorant of blackberry also at the same time proud of their ignorance.
blackberry,3ayj5v,minusSeven,2,Fri Jun 26 09:36:41 2015 UTC,"I would still love to know what all these apps are that people insist they HAVE to install? I have plenty of droid/ios friends who have a phone full of apps they don't even use, or don't even realize they have.  I did a quick check on one friend's phone and here is what I found:   games, games, games and more games a couple of crossposting utilities 5 facebook helper apps that do exactly the same thing 4 twitter apps - each having nothing over the other 3 reddit apps Snapchat and a clone app, neither are used 3 different imgur apps   ... and the list goes on like this.   So, just for shits we deleted all the doubles and triples of apps, got rid of stuff he doesn't use, or didn't know he had (hence, doesn't use). He decided to remove most of the games he had - like the 7 different solitaire apps, the many renditions of blowing things up but were essentially the same game, the half-dozen civilization/simulation type games he didn't use, and the many, many games that allow you to play one level and then pony up $3.99 to continue playing.  Long story short, he has a Galaxy S5, I have a Z30, and we have essentially the same phone now that he's removed all the apps that he just HAD to install because he could. The only difference is Snapchat. Although he has never used it, has no plans to use it, but assumes girls from all over the world are going to send him nudes sooner or later, he insisted on keeping it.  And thinking he has stripped his phone clean is a bad assumption. We both have social media apps galore, rss readers, photo apps and photo editing apps, office-type apps, cross-posters, reddit apps, etc ... I use both native and Android apps on my Blackberry, and it performs exactly like his S5, except my phone is faster,  has real multitasking, longer battery life, bla bla bla ...   So, again - what are all these apps that seem to be elusive to a Blackberry user?   PS .. I honestly would like serious answers, I'm not trying to start a fanboy war for any platform."

The reasons why Play Store isn't on BB10 and several other Android offshoots is that it's a legal thing. Android is free/open, Google apps/services come with lots of red tape. BlackBerry will NEVER be able to solve the Play Store thing unless it moves to legit Android (and probably has to kill BB10 android to do that).  I 100% think all the android rumors are BS, believe it when I see it. But more importantly, BB moving to android won't be a picnic... Pretty much all Android handset manufacturers are losing money/doing poorly, it's VERY cut throat and only going to get worse as more and more China handsets find their way to market."

The best example I can give is Google Voice - even if I had to run it as an Android app in the background, I would give anything to have it integrated into the hub. It's really the only thing I'm personally missing on the phone. If they made a way to create an official BB app that was approved to act as a bridge between the hub and the Android app, I'd be golden."
blackberry,3b0qqm,Nexhume,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:03:09 2015 UTC,"I always wondered if this was possible. Android apps can push notifications to the hub if they are configured in certain ways - see Casper, Reddit Sync, etc. If someone could write an android application which reported notifications in this same way, it could pick up notifications from apps which don't report in this way, and then push them to the hub. If those notifications are then accessible by BB apps, you could have a native BB app which then translates them into proper hub notifications with their own tab.  I've long wondered if this were possible but I lack the programming knowledge to give it a go. It depends how much access BB give to notifications pushed to the hub, I suppose."

blackberry,3az6yv,Spasticated,4,Wed Jun 24 18:00:59 2015 UTC,I've got a z30 and I'm personally holding off until the slider comes out. If the rumored specs are real then I'm all in for that device
blackberry,3az6yv,momadeen,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:21:12 2015 UTC,Z30 owner here and I'm doing the exact same thing as you. My only worry was that when I heard the rumoured specs PLUS the rumoured Android phone it seemed plausible due to the Android OS usually requiring high specs unlike BB10. I want a BB10 slider not an Android slider!
blackberry,3az6yv,stoneeus,2,Thu Jun 25 13:54:35 2015 UTC,BlackBerry CEO just recently said they would only make an android device if they could make it secure enough. I'd take it that the slider is not going to be android.
blackberry,3az6yv,mrturretman,2,Thu Jun 25 16:44:26 2015 UTC,At the very least you should wait until the slider is officially announced. There is too much speculation right now to make that decision.
blackberry,3az6yv,RchrdJ28,2,Wed Jun 24 19:12:19 2015 UTC,I'd go for what exists now: the Passport.  Waiting for the next great thing has never made sense to me when it comes to electronics.  By the time the Slider is out and actually shipping the rumours of the next goody in the pipeline will be swirling and you'll be asking yourself essentially the same question.
blackberry,3az6yv,jsteed,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:41:16 2015 UTC,"What if, just what if, the Slider runs Android? Would you still get it? I'd say get the Passport, we dont know the future of the slider especially that the company is moving hardware funds to their software sector, im not saying they will stop making devices, it's just that we dont know what BlackBerry is planning with that device. Everything is still a rumor right now."
blackberry,3az6yv,mightybond123,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:24:24 2015 UTC,He should still wait. I mean the announcement for that slider is right around the corner so what's the harm in waiting a other month or so.
blackberry,3az6yv,garcia85,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:52:53 2015 UTC,"The passport has been out for how long now? 10 months? Almost a year? The last thing you want is to buy the passport, this new slider gets announced then you're having buyers remorse for pulling the trigger on the passport.   I'm not saying not to buy the passport, I'm just saying to wait what the slider will have to offer. If it's running Android (and he doesn't like that) Then go with the passport. Maybe he'll have a better typing experience with the slider (the keyboard on the slider seems narrower than the passport)   Hell I bought a passport and returned it and I have a note 4 now. I'm itching to go back to a passport or even a classic (mainly because of the physical keys)  I say wait it out."
blackberry,3az6yv,garcia85,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:28:39 2015 UTC,Whatever works for you. I'm just throwing out suggestions.
blackberry,3az6yv,garcia85,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:41:54 2015 UTC,"I can understand that. I mean there's nothing wrong with going with the passport, if that can hold you over for the next 2 years then great. Hell I'm tempted to buy the classic but I keep telling myself to hold off for that slider."

blackberry,3az6yv,mightybond123,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:00:52 2015 UTC,"If you have the patience, I'd recommend waiting until the Slider is out. Then compare the Passport and Slider, and see which one you like more."
blackberry,3az6yv,TheTillmanator,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:38:14 2015 UTC,"Something to keep in mind is that there'll always be some new rumoured thing just around the corner. If you see a good special on the Passport then why wait? It's not like the screen's small enough that you're going to be super jealous of the screen real estate on anything else, and the phone itself seems to be future-proof enough that it will last a few years of OS updates before it starts to slow down.  I don't think you need to worry about the slider having amazing specs that make you kick yourself for getting the passport. It's apples and oranges thinking of the ""specs race"" for bb10 devices as they run so much more efficiently than Android. The passport may not have specs that make specs people drool with envy - but specs people usually run Android :p It's definitely more than powerful enough. If you can find a good special on it then just go for it."

blackberry,3az6yv,Anti-Iridium,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:02:48 2015 UTC,Another option that wasn't mentioned is to get the Passport after the Slider comes out! Since the price of the Passport is likely to take a hot and fall to a more mid range handset price.

blackberry,3ax26l,Discoveryellow,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:54:16 2015 UTC,"Another example is osx and windows, osx is a little more secured because apple chooses everything that can and cannot be a program for the machine and they control the os, windows on the other hand is the complete opposite"
blackberry,3ax26l,69hailsatan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:45:00 2015 UTC,The problem with that: Android's either open(unlocked bootloader) or after 1-2 years the phone won't get any more software updates from the manufacturer.

As far as the biometrics go, there's a reason figerprint scanners aren't used more on personal computers or to secure other devices.   I haven't heard anyone here say BlackBerry is better or more secure due to less apps, it always has to do with the OS and security features therein. BlackBerry has been the secure standard for years, it has very little to do with how few people use them (and when governments worldwide use a product I highly doubt they care about that in the first place).   There's some things about BlackBerry worth chest thumping about, comparing them to early Apple however does them a disservice regardless of how low their public adoption is."

While I wasn't in security, as a former employee I can say that it's very much a big part of development at every step of the way there, and can have a definitive say at steering meetings and architectural discussions since it's so central to the business; this is which is why BB10 is still very relevant to regulated industry and government clients."

blackberry,3ayjfm,FeetOnGrass,3,Wed Jun 24 15:10:44 2015 UTC,"Do you absolutely need a removable battery at the cost of reduced features? If no, just buy the Classic. It's so much better in every way except that you can't remove the battery. For most people that's not really an issue."
blackberry,3ayjfm,RchrdJ28,2,Wed Jun 24 17:12:08 2015 UTC,"I'm a Q10 user and I love it, but I would still say get the Classic if the price is the same. I prefer the keyboard the few times I've tried it, and like the idea of the tool belt. Size-wise it is just right, although I do appreciate the small size of the Q10. They are both very nice phones, though."
blackberry,3ayjfm,locosapiens,2,Wed Jun 24 16:00:56 2015 UTC,"Size is one of the biggest difference, if you want a more compact phone get the Q10 (but then the tradeoff is less screen space too), if you don't mind a larger phone get the Classic, both are great phones IMO."

blackberry,3ayjfm,fuskysam,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:59:09 2015 UTC,"Unless you REALLY like small/compact phones the Classic is the better device/value.   They're effectively the same in pretty much every spec except for device/screen size. The battery is bigger, but I haven't noticed longer run-times probably due to larger/less efficient screen. User replaceable battery of the Q10 is nice. Classic is a newer device which means it will be supported longer and will have a better resale value should that be a consideration."
blackberry,3ayjfm,luv2hotdog,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:21:53 2015 UTC,"Take the Classic for the Back button and the retro-feeling! But actually, I guess it makes no real difference (consider the battery thingy the others have mentioned)"
blackberry,3ayjfm,alfonsojon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:40:29 2015 UTC,"The Classic's selling point is that it has that toolbar and bigger screen. You might enjoy having the toolbar, you might not. It's surprisingly more ergonomic and efficient than you might think it is - for example, it's possible to select and mark read 50+ emails in just a few seconds and very few screen taps/button presses, or use desktop mode in the browser with mouse control. You'll often find the optical trackpad easier to use than reaching up to the screen to open apps, messages, browse menus... I love this kind of thing - but not everyone cares! :p obviously the vast majority of people are happy enough to go without, and it's not as though using a phone that DOESN'T have this toolbar is particularly hard.  The Q10 would be the better choice if you don't care about any of that and want to be able to have multiple batteries and swap them out, or even if you think you're going to hang onto it for years and want to be able to replace the battery when it wears it. Also if you want that smaller phone which is way easier to fit into your pocket and hand."

blackberry,3ayjfm,bve21,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:31:34 2015 UTC,"Oh crap, I misread.  I thought it was Q10 and Q5.  Definitely the classic.  Confused how a Classic is going for 50 bucks!"
blackberry,3ax5dn,im2Spooky4you,3,Wed Jun 24 05:26:27 2015 UTC,"Up until 2 weeks ago I would have told you to save your money as I didn't feel the Q20 was much of an upgrade. But late one night I found myself on ebay and suddenly a Q20 jumped out at me with a price I couldn't pass up (~250).  Both devices are very similar CPU/Ram/memory/camera/screen resolution wise, the biggest difference is the screen/phone size and the tool belt. The screen on the Q20 is surprisingly good and bigger than I was expecting the .4"" is definitely noticeable when the screen has a 1:1 ratio. It's MUCH brighter and things seem to be much more vibrant on it. But I never really had an issue with the Q10's screen.  Q10 was my first ever BlackBerry and having very limited experience with legacy devices I never really ""got"" the tool belt. But having it now I feel that it definitely enhances the experience. The trackpad is incredibly efficient/useful for many tasks, it's not a game changer for me but definitely a very nice to have thing. Of the whole tool belt I prefer the end call button the most, there's something very satisfying about hitting that button and being 100% sure the call is over.  If you like toys and an extra $125 isn't going to break the bank for you, I'd go with the Q20. If you're on the fence and only want to test the BB10 waters without spending too much cash the Q10 is still a very good device that excels at the basics (phone/text/emails) and has no problem browsing the web or running many (most?) android apps."
blackberry,3ax5dn,pbeaul,3,Wed Jun 24 07:15:04 2015 UTC,"If you want a keyboard get the passport, if you want a great full touch at an amazing price and get fantastic phone, get the Z30!!!!"

blackberry,3ax5dn,bve21,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:01:54 2015 UTC,"Classic is amazing but I think the Q10 has a slight edge due to having a removable battery. The better user experience is on the Classic. Q10 is also easier to fix(replacing keyboard, screen, etc)"
blackberry,3ax5dn,Boilerkim,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:07:28 2015 UTC,"I'd go for the q10. Exactly the same specs, but the classic has extra buttons for people who miss their old blackberries. They're great and work really nicely but if you didn't have an older BlackBerry you probably won't notice the difference - the os works perfectly well without them! Bigger screen on the classic though. For the price difference I'd go q10 :)"
blackberry,3ax5dn,luv2hotdog,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:32:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this is the appropriate place for this, but if you are looking to try out BlackBerry I have a White Z10 with all of the latest updates. I an selling it, as it was a spare I purchased when I was traveling for work on a weekly basis. It isn't the fastest that they offer, but it is, in my opinion, the perfect handset size wise. Ideal for the pocket. And the BlackBerry keyboard, even on an all-touch device, is the best I have used. It would be a very inexpensive entry into the BlackBerry world if you are interested. I am selling for $125 and it is mint. I only used it for a total of probably 25 to 30 hours. PM me if you are interested."
blackberry,3ax5dn,vonKemper,0,Sat Jun 27 04:04:37 2015 UTC,Try Q5 instead of Q10. Performance wise its mostly the same. If you don't want keyboard you might as well consider a leap.

There's even a native BB10 version with keyboard support, however it's been under development by a third party and I cannot comment on how well it actually works. There's supposed to be a big update for all platforms from Libretro, however the project is about 6 months late with little to no information from the developers.  So... long story short, emulation on BB10 is just fine.  EDIT: Just some more info. RetroArch for BB10 has controller support if you can get a usb adapter and/or a supported controller.

It allows me create a profile to configure/map buttons as you would expect, it recognized physical keys when I bound them to various buttons but I couldn't get the mapped keys to work in the game... No idea if I did it right and gave up after like 10 minutes."

blackberry,3aq6d5,RationalArgumentMan,3,Tue Jun 23 16:56:00 2015 UTC,"Currently their marketing strategy, and ONLY marketing strategy, appears to be word of mouth. I have NO CONCRETE IDEA why it remains that way (though I do have assumptions discussed below) - I was expecting a clear push in the NA and EU market when the Passport came out but that didn't happen. I figured they were waiting for the Classic but still nothing has come out.  Somewhere at BlackBerry HQ, some person is a power suit is probably in talks with some major agency on the ""REBUILDING THE BRAND"" front... The problem is, they don't need to rebuild themselves, and they definitely don't need a major agency to be their voice.  They have an amazing product: they're just not letting it speak for itself... It BAFFLES me that 2 years later, plenty of people in my social circles (work & life) have NO IDEA that BlackBerry makes a touchscreen phone, that there is a solution to communication overload and it's called the HUB, that my phone works in the elevator when I go up the 20 odd floors at work thanks to the amazing Antenna in my phone, or that I have 40%+ battery life at 8pm on weekdays (Z30)  I am so, so, sooooo thoroughly disappointed with BlackBerry on the marketing front. Hell, I kinda work in advertising and I could write better copy or come up with better concepts than 90% of what's been put out since the arrival of BB10.  Truth is, they probably find it hard to justify spending a chunk of cash on marketing to their share holders... Even if they had the help from the community (like you're suggesting) media buys aren't cheap. Buying ad space on all the platforms you'd want to be on can be expensive.  Then there's carrier support and the willingness to advertise on platforms and sites that routinely put you down because of their undivided love for APPL/GOOG/MSFT - that's a WHOLE other story  TL;DR    advertising is hard yo"
blackberry,3aq6d5,superniceguyOKAY,2,Mon Jun 22 20:52:20 2015 UTC,I think it would be pretty smart of them to take advantage of their small group of die hard fans in this way. Pay users of blackberry phones to do some grassroots marketing based off how many people they can successfully switch to Blackberry devices (likely with some sort of commission structure).   Die hard fans already act as brand advocates and would have even more incentive to spread the word if they were compensated in some way for it.

These are real devices which you can really use and really change settings on... Why is trust a factor? Why do you need to trust anyone? Trust is the #1 security flaw, there's no need to trust Google or BlackBerry. If you were forced to use Android it is very easy to disable all communications with Google, not the case with iOS, windows phone, or even BlackBerry, considering BlackBerry gives your usage information to 3rd party analytics. If you ever want to see this sort of thing, simply packet trace / traceroute across your router. My BlackBerry sends more data against my will to unknown hosts than Android does because I have the ability to disable it on my Android."

Further, they don't understand any of the patents that BB holds.   In their view they naively imagine loading the android OS - UI and all - on a BB Classic.   Thats most assuredly not what RIM is going to do, instead they will actually port the entire BB UI shell to Android and replace the stock interface.   From a user perspective you would be hard pressed to know what the internals are...is threading / networking provided via QNX or via Dalvik...well who really cares.  Lastly, most people completely misunderstand why Android / IOS doesn't have ""HUB""-like message handling. Its not because the designers of those OS's don't think its a great idea....its precisely because RIM holds those patents. Therefore, RIM would definitely not forsake those IP holdings and do something stupid and load a stock Android image on a BB hardware.

blackberry,3ap5l2,NightFuryToni,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:15:21 2015 UTC,"To bundle the Play Services, BlackBerry needs to be part of the Open Handset Alliance. OHA has strict requirements on the look and feel of the system, and aren't allowed to fork Android. If they do this it means no more Android runtime should BlackBerry decide to continue to sell BB10 alongside.  It's suicidal this way.

Battery is a monster, touch-enabled keyboard is amazing, will keep your typing faster and more accurate. The processor is better than the Z10, so it runs android apps better, sometimes to the point where they feel like a native app. But there are still android apps that dont work and will crash on you, but in my experience every app I need runs smoothly both native and apk."
blackberry,3appj0,AnnieB25,2,Mon Jun 22 17:43:36 2015 UTC,"I don't have a Passport, but I did have the Note 4 for about 8 months.  Overall, I LOVED the phone.  It was jam packed with features I never knew I needed.  Brilliant screen, brilliant camera, decent battery life, etc.  But...TouchWiz is just awful.  It makes the phone lag horribly in spots.  Scrolling through screens and apps, and launching apps are fine.  But using the recent apps button to switch apps and tapping on a picture you just took lag a LOT.  Also, I had a bad time getting GPS work when in motion.  I'd get a lock almost instantly when I was stationary, but when I was in motion it would drop and may not even come back until I was stationary again.  Ultimately all of these issues caused me to use my JUMP upgrade on the LG G4.  As far as typing, if you end up getting an Android device you might try downloading SwiftKey.  If you enjoyed the typing experience on your Z10, SwiftKey is quite similar because it's the underlying engine behind the BB10 virtual keyboard.  You'd lose the flick to type, but you'd gain swiping through the letters.  The predictions are still the same.  Also, if you like BB10 and the full-touch experience, you can get a Z30 pretty cheap these days."

blackberry,3appj0,AnnieB25,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:42:59 2015 UTC,"I like it so far.  The phone feels substantially smaller even though the screen is only .2 inches smaller.

I can only get about 3.5 hours of screen on time, and that's only if I use it in a normal day of about 7am-11pm.  If I leave it idle longer (like if I go to bed without recharging) it's considerably shorter.  I'm just glad LG is doing a promo for a free battery/battery charger and memory card!  I'm surprised that LG is falling behind in the battery game.

Worked perfectly for years, until Google broke it.  Now I use outlook.com to sync my calendar.  As for apps that require Google services, there are a few.  Maps says it does, but works fine anyway.  Chromecast does require them.  Chromecast will see a Chromecast that hasn't been setup just fine - until you set it up.  Miracast is built in though, and I prefer it.  Some Android VPN apps won't work, but Orbot & Orweb do.  When you get your phone, google how to sideload the Snap store.  It's really the one and only app you'll need to sideload."

blackberry,3amuqh,flexastexas,21,Sun Jun 21 19:53:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think the only issue is marketing.  BlackBerry has done literally nothing to market their products to the masses; they're out of touch, like Nintendo. On the flip side, Google and apple are HUGE on marketing (and all the oems for android). So, I think a lot of people are awash with their particular brand.  Also, there's a strange app issue going on. The /only/ argument I ever hear of why people want ios or android over bb10 is that they have more apps. This, to me, is akin to the mega pixel wars. Haveing a trillion apps, of which you only use maybe 20, does not make your system better but, I think people are having a hard time getting over that.   Lol, one last thing, ecosystem. If a customer has spent hundred (thousands?) of dollars on their brand in new phones and apps, it's going to be crazy hard for them to lose all that for a new system.  So, I think the only thing BlackBerry is doing wrong is not putting enough effort into marketing, the rest is cultural-which includes the marketing prowess of other companies."
blackberry,3amuqh,TyraeKlouds,6,Sun Jun 21 20:43:45 2015 UTC,"Isn't the total number of apps, it is apps people want. The ones that I found most useful on iOS just don't work on the blackberry or are crippled."
blackberry,3amuqh,Wrekem,2,Mon Jun 22 01:35:06 2015 UTC,"Not being able to use Google apps on my BlackBerry is seriously inhibiting some of its functionality for me   Agreed. I used to be able to click a Google Maps link from search on Android or iOS and the links would open the Maps app (whichever one you had set to default on either platform).   But on BB OS10, you can't click. There is no default hook in the browser to do anything.   It's a pain in the ass, because the Google search results will give different results from BB's Maps app and you have to go through about 5 more steps to copy + paste the address from the browser into the Maps app."
blackberry,3amuqh,by_a_pyre_light,3,Sun Jun 21 22:16:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think they care honestly. I remember reading an article like a year or two ago where they said they were going to focus their efforts on enterprise customers and not consumers. So these phones are targeted mainly for organizations invested in Blackberry's services.   It explains the lack of marketing we see and the lack of updates for things like UI changes/improvements that Android and iOS do every couple of months to keep things fresh. Also they haven't worked on trying to get popular apps like SnapChat or whatever else it is people want on BB10. The lack of support for OpenSSL also can be explained by this because, despite how popular (and likely better than IKEv2 or whatever) it is, it isn't a product that their enterprise customers would benefit from, since they'd be using BB's VPN solution (which is definitely not OpenSSL)  Can't say I'm not disappointed, but you can't blame them for trying to stay profitable. They might not have abandoned us entirely, but it definitely takes a bit more effort to stay loyal to them as a regular smartphone user."
blackberry,3amuqh,humanmanguy,2,Mon Jun 22 17:59:45 2015 UTC,"Tying into the marketing thing, they really need reps, and outreach to salespeople. My Verizon rep tried to convince me to buy a samsung S6 rather than a classic, and he was quite misinformed on the classic to boot. If BlackBerry had sales reps visiting the stores of major phone retailers, this sort of thing would be less common, and you might see more salespeople pushing towards BlackBerry."
blackberry,3amuqh,Drevkevac,0,Sun Jun 21 23:02:12 2015 UTC,I get the feeling that they've never really pushed the android app capability because it's not 100%. There's definitely something happening here so hopefully they'll then do more marketing.  I have faith in Chen. For now.
blackberry,3amuqh,mcmeekle,7,Mon Jun 22 12:45:39 2015 UTC,"Marketing and perception. All the people who could appreciate what BlackBerry offers currently either don't know it exists or are turned off by bad publicity. The publicity issue seems to be a trickle down effect from negative stock analysis and the constant near death remarks. It trickles down from analysts to stockholders to random friends to salespeople to the consumer. That broken telephone is the reason why their perception starts from analysts as ""not good"" to the consumer as ""out of business"".They have been doing things better than they have in the past, but have not overcome the negative sentiment. Instead of marketing to the world they should have taken the risk and attempted to change the perception in the largest mobile market in the world: the USA. We like to tell those yanks that they aren't the center of the universe, but more often than not they dictate popular culture and our mobile device are becoming more and more the core of our modern culture."

blackberry,3amuqh,mcmeekle,2,Sun Jun 21 20:48:22 2015 UTC,"Said he had PTSD when it was first mentioned on the podcast. Went on to say it was awful and crap. It was fine (to look at?) until you tried to do anything on it. Said users who were happy using it were wrong, although not in those words.  Went on to say that the hub is a brilliant concept but needs Google to improve it.  He made Snidey Shenk look like the good cop. That's how bad it was.  I felt like someone called my children ugly... :("
blackberry,3amuqh,by_a_pyre_light,2,Sun Jun 21 21:17:59 2015 UTC,"say that the hub is a brilliant concept but needs Google to improve it   IT DOES!  I've said this before too, check my comments or find my posts on Crackberry.  The Hub is a great idea on paper, but it's actually reduced my speed and efficiency in replying to emails because Google added this fantastic tabbed sorting feature to Gmail that the Hub completely tosses out.   In Gmail on computers and Android, you have a tab that's strictly business and personal emails. It's fast, it's efficient, and it's great. You have two other tabs for Social Media updates and sales pitches.   You can ignore those throughout the day.  But the Hub?  It dumps ALL of my messages into my phone's front end, plus ALL of my social media updates, plus ALL of my text.   There's no quick way to sort those.   I could switch between all of the tabs (which I do) or I could painstakingly try to train the BB software on what's priority vs. what isn't.   But it will never be as fast or as easy as Gmail's tabs.   BB needs to borrow that functionality ASAP."
blackberry,3amuqh,mcmeekle,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:46:35 2015 UTC,"I think we've had this convo before!   I don't doubt that it's not perfect but I was most disappointed in Fisher's attitude and tone. He was utterly dismissive like the worst fanboy. They spend their whole show talking about the shortcomings of the latest and greatest Android handsets. But when it's a BlackBerry that has issues, the tone changes. I expected better from him. Another reviewer to add to the ignore list.   In other news, hopefully you'll get something more suited to your gmail needs if this BlackBerry/Android monster comes to life."
blackberry,3amuqh,by_a_pyre_light,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:05:10 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I didn't listen to the podcast/watch the video (I couldn't find a link) so I can't comment on the reviewer or their show, but I was simply replying to that one point you called out.   Every platform has fanboys, and as a natural consequence of being such a small share of the market, BlackBerry fanboys are some of the most vocal about their opinions, and the staunchest in their firm belief of BB's superiority. It's really bad at CrackBerry, where even being an owner and asking for help on something earns you a chorus of ""you don't know how to do it? Go get an Android, asshole!"" Not even kidding, I have had some encounters like that.   Anyway, the thing is the complaint you listed above was listed as one of the points he made that you felt were not correct, and many people on here, being staunch fans of the platform, will echo that sentiment.   So I wanted to clear things up from a recent BlackBerry adopter's perspective (picked up a Passport a month ago) and point out that just because the Hub is good, doesn't mean that it can't be vastly improved by borrowing things from the competition.   I mean, look at iOS: it's seen significant improvements since adopting Android's notification bar and other features, and Android wouldn't be anything like it is today if it hadn't scrapped its early BB-like plans after the debut of the first iPhone. So clearly, picking the best parts of the competition to adopt can be a great thing for end users."

blackberry,3amuqh,EnsErmac,2,Mon Jun 22 00:27:29 2015 UTC,"I think that it is the fact that the world has left BlackBerry behind. Your chance of running all of the latest apps is limited to running an Android version in a compatibility layer. A lot of bank applications still do not work correctly, the social media apps are either made by RIM or non-existent. The other side of it is, because they managed to lose the market share that they have, people are now entrenched into an Apple or Google ecosystem. Why would they want to lose all of the money that they spent on apps to switch?  I have a Q10 and love it for getting work done, but when I buy a new phone, I'm probably going to get an iPhone, just because I'd rather have piece of mind that something will just work on it, rather than trying to install an Android APK and hope that an app will run."

I love my Q5. I find it better than iOs but on par with Android. Which is a FANTASTIC position to be in. Blackberry should just find comfort in the fact that it is an EXCELLENT phone that has suffered marketing and PR woes that have caused it to fall behind in the popularity contest. As long as they don't get greedy, they'll do fine, if they don't dominate the market like they used to, no need. It can remain a very versatile fighter from behind the scenes in a much dimmer spotlight. No need to be the life of the party. If the wallflower at the social can still get as many girls as the party animal does, just in a much different and much less glamorous environment, like the library or supermarket, does it matter? He's still getting girls.  People just want to be the star of the show so bad. But they forget to how many people they already are. They found a niche, amongst a very distinct group of people. And which products always make good money? Niche products."

blackberry,3ajcfu,scrid2000,4,Sun Jun 21 14:36:39 2015 UTC,"Android APK apps tend not to run as smoothly on Blackberry though. I love my Blackberry, but some apps are just frustrating to run."
blackberry,3ajcfu,fullmetal-13,2,Sat Jun 20 23:24:13 2015 UTC,some android apps run perfectly fine though.  I'd love if a software dev could explain why that is.  android apps on blackberry are running the same manner that they do when running on android there should really be very little difference in performance.
blackberry,3ajcfu,brkdncr,2,Sat Jun 20 23:42:13 2015 UTC,"Because the hardware the BlackBerry is is older, and less fast than modern android phones.  BlackBerry also doesn't implement ART, it runs Davlik, so there's no pre-optimization of the applications, and the code has to be re-interpreted each time an application runs.  The Davlik VM runs on top of QNX rather than linux (they're similar, but definitely not identical), so it adds extra abstraction layer."
blackberry,3ajcfu,halon1301,2,Sun Jun 21 02:08:54 2015 UTC,Yup. Faster hardware will make it less noticeable over time. The Passport runs them fairly well.
blackberry,3ajcfu,MoopusMaximus,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:20:24 2015 UTC,"It's my understanding that a passport is on par with at least the last gen android devices. a little Google searching on art v dalvik says that you get a little bit of performance improvement with art, but not much. As to abstraction, it shouldn't matter much, a VM is a VM and should incur about the same perfomance hit. I wonder if blackberry needs to work on its davlik code."

Aside from ultra-popular apps like Facebook, etc... BlackBerry World has a poor selection of most major Android/iOS apps. Hangouts, Google Music, Strava, Pocketcasts, the list goes on.  | Myth: BlackBerry phones aren’t for everyone  Fact: BlackBerry phones, by their very nature, are indeed for everyone. |  Ridiculous. If this were true (read their description), BlackBerry would hold far more of the market share. People enjoy iOS and Android devices because they are extremely geared towards media. BlackBerry devices generally don't come close when it comes to things like picture/video quality, screen resolution, etc.  I enjoy my BlackBerry as much as the next guy, but extremely biased, simply untrue posts like this are nuts. I think what's worse is that when people bring up things like picture/video quality, hardware specs or screen resolution in the BlackBerry VS iOS/Android debate, BlackBerry fanboys love to downplay those aspects by specifically saying that BlackBerry devices are meant for work, not play therefore those aspects are of a secondary concern."
blackberry,3ajcfu,RationalArgumentMan,4,Sat Jun 20 23:54:46 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree entirely, though Snap has loaded all the apps I've ever wanted just fine (banking, music streaming).   Android/iOS devices are also popular because they're everywhere, and popularity feeds itself (even disregarding any app disparity). Their release cycle plays into the trend of upgrading every six months to a year as well; with BB I plan on having my Classic for at least two years before seeing what else might be available.   I recommend BB to people who know exactly what they want from their devices, and often that means they're not heavy app users or into all the incessant forms of social media."

However, 10.3 brought (what I think are) software issues that would cause the CPU to work really hard and drain my battery.  Like, my battery would be very hot, and would last 3 hours.  When looking at the device manager Android Player was the issue.  This was all find after a hard restart and security wipe which resulted in losing all contacts and such.  Now I’m running 10.3.1.1865 and its being temperamental with battery life. Sometimes the phone will last me 2 days, sometimes 2 hours.  This time however, it appears PIM Services is to blame.

blackberry,3aidaj,pill0w,3,Sat Jun 20 13:53:39 2015 UTC,"I got the passport in december, I always like to update my devices no longer than year.  I had a few early HTC androids, and I tried the Samsungs, and also the Xperia's.  Always top shelf phones.  This Passport is my favorite phone of all time, it's smooth, quick, I've only NEEDED to restart the phone one time, and the only time i had a couple problems, an update showed up within a few days and the problem was gone.  I never previously had a BB, but I will definitely be getting the next gen passport if it comes, and certainly will get another blackberry.    The lack of apps doesn't bother me at all, a little research has allowed me to find a convenient solution every time.  Android was always infinitely more buggy than the BB for me, way less stable, I never had a device that could go longer than a week without a restart.   Even if BB put out an android device I wouldn't use it, the BB OS is very well made imo, and very different from the other OS's, I'd suggest just getting a passport now, you'll be surprised by how easy they are to use.  If you have a carrier that allows you to try phones you could start there."

Or hook it up to my bedroom TV to stream Netflix. The HDMI out with no need for adapter is great.  My Passport, once I got used to it (like 2 days), has been my daily driver for the past 8 months. It's fantastic for reading well, anything and obviously texting, or writing about anything.  If screen size, say gaming or heavy video usage is your thing, you may want a phone with larger 16:9/15:10 screen ratio, grab a Z30 or most Android devices. I'm keeping a very close eye on the rumored slider phone. It most likely will be a purchase, otherwise I'm sticking to what I have.

blackberry,3afg88,eddy_07,5,Fri Jun 19 21:48:46 2015 UTC,Developers go where the customers are. Customers go where the app development is. BB doesn't have enough of either to actually grow an app ecosystem.  Microsoft has made it so that Apple and Android apps are easier to port but it still requires developers to port them over. WP10 doesn't just play Android apps like BB10 does. The advantage Microsoft has is revenue and the ability to pump money into software development. They also have a lot of in house developers. BB has very few such resources.

Also IMHO BlackBerry has muddied the waters with the Android runtime support (which I love and use all the time). No developers have even less reason to make a native BlackBerry app."
blackberry,3afg88,Arjainz,5,Fri Jun 19 21:51:43 2015 UTC,"In my case its not really the lack of apps that prevent my from buying another bb to replace my z10. Its the price of their phones (I'm not from the US). The Leap which is their budget model costs more than some flagship Chinese brand android phones. I dont expect bb to make bargain basement models buy if bb can make new models at a lower cost, then better."
blackberry,3afg88,dzyan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:54:16 2015 UTC,"Completely understand, on the one hand, I love my Z30, I tried a Samsung Galaxy S4 and hated the email client, I could not get it to work the way I wanted it to, even with other mail clients installed. On the other hand I would like to upgrade to a Passport but do not want to pay full price for it (I refuse contracts as a matter of principal).   Before I upgraded to the S4/Z30 I was using an HTC One C, a entry (value/bargain) priced device. It was terrible, there was a reason why it was priced the way it is, slow processor, slow memory, crappy implementation of the OS.  Also I kinda blame Apple for the prices of Smartphones. They price their iDevices so high, and the fans buy them, they buy a lot. The other manufactures look at this and then have to price their hardware to be in line with them or else consumers will perceive them to be lower quality. But then on the other hand consumers are looking to save money and are doing research, but economics does not target the informed consumer but the masses who want the status symbol and thing price = prestige."

blackberry,3afg88,duane534,7,Tue Jun 23 03:08:14 2015 UTC,"I agree that it would be nice to have more native app support, however apps are not what made me pick BlackBerry. I don't think the ""app gap"" can be ignored, sometime soon companies are going to have to do what Snap does for BlackBerry and what Windows 10 will do for Windows Phone; we're going to have to have universal apps.   I came from a WP background so by default with sideloading BlackBerry already has more apps than the ecosystem I'm most accustomed with. Snap loads the few apps I use quite well for the most part, and BlackBerry World and the defaults/browser cover the rest pretty handily.   It's a tough thing, because I want BlackBerry to succeed and continue to grow and be a great company, however I want them to maintain their ""BlackBerry-ness"" too and not go full on Android ROM or the like. Don't think I'm a typical phone user in this regard, but I feel really bad for the ""fringe"" OS's that don't get a chance because they don't run with the popular crowd.   More choices, less monopoly if you please."

blackberry,3afg88,RevisionCuda,6,Fri Jun 19 20:45:03 2015 UTC,"""It cant be a programming issue because that is just outsourced and isnt a big financial cost and Blackberry has made it easy to use several different programming languages to make them""  As someone who normally does Android dev and has tinkered with BlackBerry's SDK a reasonable amount, your statement isn't entirely correct. Big companies don't always outsource app development -- Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc. have app development teams working in the US, and it's a pretty big financial commitment to throw five programmers at an app for a platform they'll need to support indefinitely, plus train support for handling a 3rd/4th platform.   As far as ease of development goes, the Android runtime definitely helps, but many, many apps use Google Play services to enable basic functionality (like getting user position -- not technically necessarily, but the normal Android way of doing so is more difficult), or advanced functionality, like geofences and activity detection. BlackBerry's replacement library covers some of what Google Play services does, but not nearly enough for many apps.   Regarding the native BB dev, it's definitely not bad, and it has some really good documentation (in many places way better than the equivalent Android documentation), and the fact that there are ways to do native from JS and C++ is definitely cool, but there's still a volume problem in finding developers proficient at BB10 dev to write apps. When you could learn Android/iOS dev and be guaranteed the effort expended learning those platforms will be valuable several years from now, it's a hard sell to convince someone to learn a platform with an uncertain future, like WP or BB.   There's nothing wrong with BB10, and it's ridiculous that (as mentioned elsewhere in the comments) companies won't accept money or open their APIs to expand their user base, but it's pretty understandable why BB and WP, and pretty much every other smaller platform, continue to have ""app problems"" even years after launch."
blackberry,3afg88,BorgDrone,2,Fri Jun 19 22:17:24 2015 UTC,"That's sort of a tough question to answer, and it really depends on the developer's background. It's much easier to get around the concepts needed to learn (stuff like learning to deal with application lifecycles, low-performance mobile devices, how to write responsive layouts, etc.), but Android apps are (mostly) written in Java, and BlackBerry apps are JavaScript/C++, so a developer might have to learn those two languages. There's also a kind of complicate interaction between UI and program code in the Cascades framework (although it does make some things easier), which would take a while to get the hang of. I'd say you could get the basics in 40 or 50 hours, but mastery would take much longer (as long as any mobile platform would take to master -- for some context, I've logged at least 700 paid hours on freelancing jobs for Android, plus a couple hundred more interning, and while I feel really comfortable with it now, I still need to learn new features on an almost weekly basis).   I mostly deal in Android, so I'm more familiar with development times there, but assuming they're similar (and from what I've done, they seem to be), perhaps 25-50 hours for a raw prototype, and 100 hours for a simple alpha? Initially writing the app wouldn't be the main issue, it's more polishing it so it looks good and consistently performs well that takes time. For something simple (like a weather app), maybe 150 hours? For something more complex (like a social networking client), you could easily spend several hundred hours getting something into a polished state.   I think for big companies the issue with supporting BlackBerry is equally one of maintaining the apps to a level of quality they feel they need as it is one of initially developing an app. It can be a tough sell to try and convince someone to commit a few hundred thousand dollars a year to continue to support a smaller OS like BB or WP (you can even see this within Android as companies drop support for Froyo and Gingerbread which have almost as many -- maybe more -- users even today as does all of BB10)."
blackberry,3afg88,Somhlth,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:23:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no problem. It's definitely a tough problem to solve for them -- as far as comparing it to Android in terms of keeping up with different versions, it seems to be better, although it hasn't been around long enough to really tell. For now, version-to-version upkeep is pretty minor. The companies you usually see developing for BB (and WP, to some extent) are the ones that need the most exposure (small ones needing every single user), so it's a good marketplace for them and indie devs. The reason I don't think we see large single-app companies developing for smaller platforms (e.g. Snapchat) is that they have a ton of users, so an extra percent or two for developing a BB app versus retaining a lot of Android/iOS users (or even attracting more) through adding features/squashing bugs on those existing apps might be cheaper for them."

blackberry,3afg88,WeaponizedMeerkat,2,Tue Jun 23 03:13:24 2015 UTC,"BlackBerry runs Android apps quite well.  Most developers don't need to create yet another version of their app, since BlackBerry can run the Android version.  If you are not particularly technical, you can simply download the Amazon android app store and install it.  It comes automatically with 10.3 and higher anyway.  If you are more technically inclined, you can install the Snap store, which is a mirror of the Google Play store.   It has to be sideloaded, and is pretty much the only thing the you need to sideload.  It requires a Google account, but after that it works great.  There are a small number of apps that require Google Services, and may not function.  Most of those can be substituted with a different app.  The Snap store, while more complicated to install, has more apps, and is typically more updated than Amazon.  It is the preferred store.  Having said that, Amazon has a daily free app.  Sometimes they are very worthwhile.  Simply go here to see how to install Snap:  http://crackberry.com/how-use-snap-blackberry-1021-install-android-apk-files"

It is quite simply opposite of how a product is marketed and it is a legacy brand with an adequate amount of sales to justify the action.

In total, I have just over 100 Android apps on my phone.  I can easily be called a power user, and I put my phone through its paces on a regular basis. The only two apps that I've had issues with are Zenmate, a VPN app that I didn't expect to work, and Chromecast (Google Services not at your service).  I use my Surface when I need to use Zenmate, and I use Miracast insted of Chromecast (and Miracast is built in to my Surface as well).  I really don't see the big issue.

If you are getting it from AT&T, ask them their return policies. You'll know in 7-10 days if you like it or not.   As for experience, I may not be the one to ask. I use my smart phones for a few  things mainly:  Email - BB is second to none in this regard, it just is the best.   My banking- I had to sideload an Android app to get the app with cheque deposit, but it works like a charm.   Phone. I am older and love to talk to people, text, not so much. The phone is clear and reception always top notch.   Web browsing. It is fast and easy to read due to screen. I never used to use it, but now I do often to check info.   Kindle - Love reading during breaks in the day and the screen size is great for it.   I use other apps, like BBM, Facebook, Instagram, and other social media and it all works well, but I don't use them often. Battery is great and I recharge about every other day.   Blend works well, but I don't text or BBM enough to fully utilize it. I just check my email in Outlook  when on computer.   As an aside, if size is an issue, you may want to try the Z30, the battery is fine, the screen is what you are used to and the typing is excellent even if it is touch.

The touch enabled keyboard on the Passport is great for typing regular sentences though."

Blackberry sells it for $349 in Canada and I am sure discounts can be had.   I doubt you could get more than $100 for it. Maybe $150 if you're lucky.
blackberry,3aeitp,djredcent,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:48:42 2015 UTC,"$200 unlocked would probably be fair if it's boxed or close to new condition. But someone from BlackBerry canada is offering a code where you can buy Z30s for $199 brand new unlocked straight from BlackBerry's online store, just to give you some perspective on what other offers are out there."
blackberry,3aflm0,superniceguyOKAY,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:02:54 2015 UTC,Have you tried a hard reset yet? Normally you have to perform a hard reset a few times after an update.
blackberry,3aflm0,mightybond123,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:14:24 2015 UTC,Wow. That is not normal!  Let me explain. After OS updates there may be file indexing going on in the background. That is usually the lag you see after an update. The best course of action is to leave the phone alone (charging overnight is best) and let it do it's thing. These phones don't have big processing power and when it's really busy you notice it.
blackberry,3aflm0,eddy_07,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:27:45 2015 UTC,You realize the phone will ask you to perform a restart when the update is over right?
blackberry,3aflm0,mightybond123,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:43:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, but that doesn't explain your comment of ""normally"" performing a hard reset ""a few times"" after an update. That's not normal at all. I used to reset it once maybe but doing it several times then I realized nothing happened and it ""fixed"" itself over night. What the OP is seeing as a flickering screen is not a normal update. Something went wrong."
blackberry,3aflm0,eddy_07,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:02:25 2015 UTC,"Reset by holding both volume keys. If that doesn't work you may have to try reloading your software. If Link can detect your device over usb then back it up and reload device software (located in preferences tab at the top). If link can't detect your device then I hope you had a recent backup that you can use because a device wipe may be in order. I hope it doesn't come down to that. It's a rare issue to have OTA installs go bad, but it can happen to anyone. I usually wait until I'm home and I can plug my phone in and leave it to update or better yet update over usb through Link."

blackberry,3ad48y,kindweather,4,Sat Jun 20 04:45:40 2015 UTC,"In the U.S. I believe AT&T are the only carrier of the Passport and I personally have not seen them market this phone anywhere. The only reason I know when it arrived in stores is because I actively search for it. I have also not seen Blackberry do any sort of promotion in traditional ways (radio/TV), usually you have to go to tech sites to actually hear about the phones. Again this is only my personal experience maybe someone has seen something I've missed?"
blackberry,3ad48y,petesyoungerbrother,2,Fri Jun 19 04:51:27 2015 UTC,"You're right, the promotional videos they make only exist on youtube. Marketing imo is still lacking."
blackberry,3ad48y,mightybond123,2,Fri Jun 19 08:00:40 2015 UTC,You actually saw one in store? I've been to several AT&T stores in my area and have yet to spot one. How's that for marketing?
blackberry,3ad48y,mcmanninc,2,Fri Jun 19 10:56:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, I got mine back in March or so, and it was in the back corner of the store. I was the first person to buy one at that location (although  I was the first to buy my Z10 from another store location a few years ago), and I got it about 3 weeks after release. I haven't been back to the store since so I can't say whether or not they are still there. Shame that you say they are not in store anymore. I felt the lady really wanted to sell me a different phone."
blackberry,3ad48y,petesyoungerbrother,3,Fri Jun 19 12:25:46 2015 UTC,"When I went in to buy my Z10, the first question I was asked was ""Why?"". The funny part is that after I explained my reasons, the salesman conceded that I had made good points, and even talked the phone up a bit as well. That didn't change the fact that I was treated as though I were at least a little crazy for wanting one throughout the entire transaction. When pushed, he agreed it was a good phone, but I still shouldn't buy it.   Now they don't have any Blackberrys on display. Just silly."
blackberry,3ad48y,mcmanninc,5,Fri Jun 19 13:06:06 2015 UTC,"Verizon treated me the same way when I went to buy a Q10. They didn't have any BB devices on display, so the salesman had to go check in the back room. He found some, but proceeded to tell me how it's not the phone I want. Completely ridiculous. Eventually I told him that I'd already made up my mind so he could just cut the crap."

The same as yourself, loved rooting and flashing different roms, building my own roms and all that crap. I changed to the Passport at the start of the year just because i was bored with android.   I love my passport, my wife also got one after playing with mine. There is actually nothing i miss from android but i never really used hundreds of different apps. I guess if you do use lots of different apps id certainly think about how much your going to miss them."
blackberry,3adn6y,fattylewis,2,Fri Jun 19 07:44:41 2015 UTC,"I only use Facebook and its messenger, a Reddit app, and occasionally Instagram and Spotify or Pandora. Don't game like I used to. Don't think I would be missing too much honestly. I just want a good size comparison of the passport because it just looks wide as hell.        Also can you use the scroll feature on the keyboard like the old track pad to make certain selections? I loved that thing"
blackberry,3adn6y,mightybond123,3,Fri Jun 19 08:00:39 2015 UTC,"We have facebook app for sure, I use an app called 'Reddit in motion ' for reddit, Instagram and spotify apk's work like a charm as if they are native."

But the back cover is more slippery than the black which has a rubberized coating for more grip. I got used to the red one after a couple days so but it varies from user to user. Both have a premium quality feel to them. Go for it the passport is an amazing device. You get used to the size very quickly, I can't believe how small other phones look."

blackberry,3abbgs,inked18,0,Thu Jun 18 21:31:54 2015 UTC,"The problem is they can't do this. If they do go Android it will be for the Google Apps/Services and OHA (Open Handset Alliance) rules governing the proprietary Google apps/services strictly prohibits that possibility.  The only way it can do this is if they remove the Android functionality from BB10 first, which would pretty much kill the vast majority of the current apps and what limited app support currently exists.  If they do go down this road BB10 will become the super secure OS with zero apps and Android will be the consumer version with half-ass BB10 features. The HUB won't work the same, universal search wont work the same, gestures and other parts of the UI can probably be recreated."
blackberry,3abbgs,pbeaul,2,Thu Jun 18 22:01:36 2015 UTC,"No, that is incorrect. BB10 can still co-exist along Android. What the OHA membership stipulates is that if you make an Android phone that does not pass the Android Compatibility Test Suite (this assures that all apps written for Android will work without issues) then you do not get to use Google Apps and Services. Since BB10 is not an Android OS this is not an issue."
blackberry,3abbgs,crackerforhire,2,Fri Jun 19 02:11:52 2015 UTC,"BB10 incorporates a fork of the Android code that has been heavily modified so that it can integrate nicely with BB10.

If you're curious if this is possible I suggest you look into what happend to Acer circa 2012, when it tried a similar thing.  Edit: Just to be clear, BB10 can co-exist with Android...

If you don't care about the CTS then you are free to do with Android as you please.  As for Acer, what they were attempting to do was release an Android phone that did not pass the CTS.

Drivers for various sensors/SOCs are kind of irrelevant to this discussion as that's something every manufacturer would need to do for any device... I'm not familiar with how the finger print sensor works, but that's just another driver/sensor, new authentication implementation, and a tweaked lock screen to take advantage of the sensor, nothing particularly complex. The Multi-window support potentially requires more intrusive kernel level code changes depending on how process scheduling is handled but I suspect it's not that intrusive/significant. Either way, I'd agree that Samsung has taken the most latitude with the Android experience and I think it hurts Android more than it helps in many cases.

If anything, a Google certified BB phone would probably undermine your BB ecosystem because more and more people would quit using it if they decided to buy the BB Android phone instead   No, I don't think Google cares very much about BlackBerry. But I do think they care about setting a precedent of allowing 3rd parties to participate in OHA as well as compete with them using their code/ecosystem. The mere fact that an Android runtime exists in BB10 at all pretty much explains the state of the BB app ecosystem.   BB10 isn't catching on, I don't dispute that, what I'm curious about is if it's even possible for BlackBerry to transition over to Android proper without lighting the place on fire first. It just makes very little sense for Google to help BlackBerry transition over and open itself up to future problems by allowing loopholes.  FYI I've asked that question to the /r/android community here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/3adb8g/can_blackberry_become_an_oha_open_hanset_alliance/ no idea if the mods will approve it though."

blackberry,3abbgs,mrturretman,0,Thu Jun 18 22:59:41 2015 UTC,"I really doubt you have anything but hot air to back up your position. The fact that you think BlackBerry engineers have done something special to be able to ""read android things"" is indicative of how little you know about the underlying Android implementation.   I suggest you educate yourself on the difference between Android AOSP (what BlackBerry currently does) and OHA which is what everyone around here thinks BlackBerry can easily do. If you spend more than 30 seconds doing so, you might come to understand why going from AOSP to OHA isn't a simple task.  But feel free to disagree with me based on nothing but ignorance on the matter."

blackberry,3aajze,alfonsojon,3,Thu Jun 18 15:14:38 2015 UTC,"Some good ideas.   Honestly, the whole situation is a little strange, kind of like puzzle pieces but there's no image on the pieces or a picture to reference. It's all just blank puzzle pieces right now. Most of those puzzle pieces being a reference to the rumors/leaks.  What's interesting is, looking back on the ""Blackberry Experience Suite"" video, it's very clear they want to be software focused. With them porting the likes of HUB to Android/iOS/Windows, it's odd they would suddenly pay way more attention to Android. I mean, technically speaking, they can port all of these things to a blackberry exclusive device (ie a Z3) that's loaded with Windows or Android. However, iOS would never let that happen. Therefore the experience suite has to be explicitly software, through apps.   Anyways, this is all to go back to the Android rumor in the first place. Maybe they're not playing with android on a fundamental level (ie switching OS), but instead on a surface level. Improving android ""emulation"" in whatever way they come up with, which you've provided some ideas to implement this better form of emulation."
blackberry,3aajze,ssssarang,3,Thu Jun 18 15:57:03 2015 UTC,"Also very good points. I feel like BlackBerry could very well focus on software, although that would imply a further downsize. I'd hate to see BlackBerry lose their hardware, as that's the main reason I bought my BlackBerry."
blackberry,3aajze,Linegod,3,Thu Jun 18 16:12:16 2015 UTC,"This makes zero sense - from a technology side or a marketing side.  Apps on top of QNX without Google Play is what you have already.   This is the issue people have with it today.   Adding in the mess that is Android is not going to make things better, only worse."
blackberry,3aajze,9vDzLB0vIlHK,3,Thu Jun 18 18:35:18 2015 UTC,"I agree.    An Android handset without Google Play doesn't solve the app problem.  Looking at BlackBerry's 40-F from Q4 FY 2015, they acknowledge the poor app selection as its own separate paragraph in the risk section, apart from the problem of declining handset sales, etc.  Any solution that is aimed at attacking that risk and doesn't get you Google Play seems like it isn't worth doing because it won't actually get you any more apps.   An Android handset doesn't fit into the security-first strategy.  BlackBerry says that they're focusing both their handsets and BES towards regulated industries like healthcare, finance, and government.  Security is BlackBerry's lifeblood, and those regulated industries seem like the only places that are willing to pay a premium for the security of BES and BlackBerry handsets.  Releasing an Android handset just doesn't seem to fit in with that vision unless BlackBerry has evolved the containerization features of Secure Work Space in BES 12 beyond what they've already shown.  Or maybe I don't know what I'm talking about, and SWS is more than enough to have a properly secure Android.  I'm just a dude on the internet.  The Android handset market is really crowded and no one but Samsung makes money in it.  Second tier manufacturers have a hard time making any money, and BlackBerry doesn't manufacture its own hardware, it's all outsourced to Foxconn, et. al.  The value of badge engineering an Android phone and calling it a BlackBerry would have made sense years ago, but BlackBerry's cache has taken a beating.  I'm pretty sure that the reason BlackBerry hasn't stopped making handsets is that the handset and BES sales are symbiotic; the existence of BES makes handsets worth buying, and the existence of handsets makes BES worth buying.  Unless BlackBerry Android provides a really strong value proposition to regulated industries, I'm not sure how it preserves BES sales.  All of that said, I wouldn't be at all surprised to know that BlackBerry has Android booting on all of the current handsets in its labs.  Apple booted OSX on Intel chips for years before abandoning PowerPC as both experiments and to mitigate risks.  BlackBerry has developers working on the Android Runtime, it wouldn't surprise me if they have people working on Android proper.  Also, if anyone can pull of an actually secure Android, it'd be people familiar with Android internals, like the developers doing the Android Runtime, not one of the multitude of companies whose Android software is mostly skins and apps that no one wants but can't delete.  Which is all to say that this doesn't make sense to me, but that I am willing to entertain the idea that I, as an outsider, am missing some crucial piece of the big picture that makes it make sense."
blackberry,3aajze,stoneeus,2,Thu Jun 18 19:41:43 2015 UTC,I think it's more likely that they will produce both BB10 and Android devices with android aimed at bringing more consumers into the BlackBerry sphere. Thereafter it's a matter of juxtaposing BB10 as a superior security and productivity focused platform for those seeking such qualities.
blackberry,3aajze,avaican,2,Thu Jun 18 16:13:55 2015 UTC,I think it will pan out like the HTC One M8 (which had an Android and Windows Phone versions).
blackberry,3aajze,RaginRobertG,2,Thu Jun 18 17:18:09 2015 UTC,"I truly believe that BlackBerry will continue to support BlackBerry 10. I suspect what they'll do is continue to release lower end phones operating Android, and higher end models running BB10. This does a couple of things for them, but essentially has the potential to increase net device sales (good optics) while maintaining BB10 for the BlackBerry base/Enterprise market.   This late in the game, with BB 10.3.2 already rolling out and the mention of further work being done on BB 10.3.3, I'd be very surprised if they either dropped it or found some complicated manner in which to incorporate Android into it. The investment in QNX and the years spent on the OS would be such a painful waste of resources given that the OS structure is, comparatively, in much better shape than iOS or Android in the sense that it's technological EOL is further out.   That's not too say, however, that if things get really bleak, BlackBerry may simply have no choice but to commit to Android."
blackberry,3aajze,minusSeven,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:48:28 2015 UTC,I believe if Blackberry is going android its to get google play services. Its pointless other wise. Most android apps work very well on blackberry(it actually does better than on my sony xperia). Only major apps that need google play services don't work.   Other than that the only productive thing android has is widgets(sorry active frames doesn't cut it). Android is not as customizable as blackberry. You will need to get hold of task manager every time android lags. App permissions won't be customizable and it won't even contain a default file manager.   So I just don't know about the whole moving to android thing.
blackberry,3a88dv,ariespoge,5,Thu Jun 18 00:19:25 2015 UTC,I'm crying! Finally an Android phone with a keyboard and the screen isn't 4 or less inches. November can not come soon enough!  Is this official or just rumor?

blackberry,3a88dv,TPKK,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:15:09 2015 UTC,"Google doesn't roll that way. I'm pretty sure BlackBerry has to join the OHA and follow Google's guidelines which include agreeing not to create incompatible forks of Android. Only then will they get access to Google Play Services.   I don't see why BlackBerry couldn't keep BB10 around for the people that want it, and release Android phones as well. The only issue I can see is BlackBerry might have to remove their Android capabilities from BB10"
blackberry,3a88dv,ExultantSandwich,6,Tue Jul 7 07:46:44 2015 UTC,That's my dilemma too.   I have an Android for work and I don't like how it works plus the plethora of bugs and malware.    If they do load Android for the OS then it's just another Android phone IMHO.

While that is absolutely true, people are easily sold on specs and will be easily convinced the lower specs aren't as good regardless of performance.

blackberry,3a88dv,AcousticConfusion,2,Thu Jun 18 07:10:01 2015 UTC,"The screen is gorgeous and BB10 is remarkably smooth on it.  And, the touch capacitive keyboard is pretty darn sweet.  But, then the muscle memory and productivity we are all used to from the 9900 and Q10 is missing.  It is like BlackBerry decided to innovate...then forget a large portion of their core, loyal users and their overarching needs.  I think I will get used to it.  But, I just think it could have been better. Also, as I did also love my Z10, I think a full touchscreen Passport would have been killer."
blackberry,3a88dv,kanuk101,2,Thu Jun 18 07:28:45 2015 UTC,Yeah muscle memory isn't a big issue. I've gotten used to almost every qwerty phone I've used in the past. Actually I'm not a fan of the square shape but I wouldn't be surprised if that's where the market heads in 5 years. Wider tablet-like phones. Blackberry is probably ahead of it's time right now.

That said, BlackBerry could make an Android/QNX system that doesn't run the BB10/Cascades application stack, launcher, etc. That would be a viable hybrid system and would probably not give up much in terms of security, since Android's biggest weakness is Linux.    Arent u just giving up security in exchange for a few stupid apps?   Sort of? I guess some apps would run a bit better, but 100% compatibility should be the goal.    And hasnt it been stated that BB's processor is not built to handle android?   That doesn't make any sense. The bootloader/firmware might not make it very easy."
blackberry,3a6mdb,crackerbarreljoe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:48:05 2015 UTC,"""Yes. It's architecturally impossible to match BB10's security with Android/Linux.""  What do you mean by that? How so?"
blackberry,3a6mdb,akebeth,8,Wed Jun 17 20:02:34 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by that? How so?   Put simply, you can't really secure Linux to the same extent that you can QNX because of its monolithic architecture. It can certainly have the same sort of policies through something like SELinux, but it can't actually enforce those policies because any exploit of the system compromises everything.  Beside that, the smaller scope and cleaner overall implementation of QNX makes it easier to actually secure. So, it's more practical to actually harden the system. It's a matter of complexity, size of the codebase, and also a far, far smaller attack surface.  If you'd like a more in-depth primer on microkernels and security, genode has a good one:   http://genode.org/documentation/general-overview/index  Note that this doesn't mean that the system is perfectly hardened, merely that it can be while Linux cannot be."

blackberry,3a6mdb,crackerbarreljoe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:42:06 2015 UTC,To be OHA compliant it would have to be just Android and the code approved by Google. They can't just sign up. This means no QNX and it might let Google in on a lot of security secrets/patents with no real benefit to BlackBerry. All current devices running the android runtime would have to be stripped down to just BB10 as well which would cripple it and leave BB10 fans out of options.
blackberry,3a6mdb,eddy_07,2,Wed Jun 17 22:22:14 2015 UTC,"Right, so really they're in the Amazon App ghetto regardless. The real question is whether or not they would benefit from getting the rest of the Android AOSP-style experience and the launchers, and usability model, etc. that people find familiar there.   Personally, I like using BB10 a lot more than Android. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that I find Android supremely unusable. I think I'm deeply in the minority there, though."
blackberry,3a6mdb,crackerbarreljoe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:37:49 2015 UTC,Well count me in that minority.

blackberry,3a4dlq,perianderson,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:35:22 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved it.  Best onscreen keyboard by far IMO. I thought it was going to be tough going from a keyboard to a virtual one, but it was really seamless.  I now have a Samsung S5, and I cannot for the life of me find any keyboard as good as the Z30's. I recently switched from BB to Android after 15 years of BB's as I was annoyed by not getting notifications on side loaded apps, but I will admit, I sure do miss typing on that old Z30"

blackberry,3a1hg7,RationalArgumentMan,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:03:49 2015 UTC,"It's a big difference, Classic toolbelt helps (I am just getting used to it now) but overall it's not %100 integrated into the system, so you still need to touch the screen more often than you would on 9900, for example. With my 9900 it was extremely fast, and I still find 9900 to be a more productive tool with email filing, reply, shortcuts and more. OS10 overall is slower and doesn't work all that well with toolbelt shortcuts. I had to remove on screen word suggestions because when I am filing and email it would just make the folder list jump for a split second and make me miss my folder.  Otherwise, it's a big upgrade over Q5 and it's piratically Q10 with toolbelt and non-removable battery. Classic is on sale on Amazon for $330, get it while you can.  Personally, I still couldn't make myself switch to Classic completely, I am still using my Z30."

Sure, why not?  These are the official specs:  Up to 14 hours GSM talk time Up to 14.5 days GSM standby time Up to 24 hours UMTS talk time Up to 14.5 days UMTS standby time Up to 91 hours audio playback Up to 11 hours video playback   So yeah, with my pattern of use I'd say 100 hours is a possibility."

Both at the same time. disconnected the call and closed the GPS as soon as I pulled into the driveway battery showed juice 70% left."

The usage is as stated cept for the emails yesterday. I didn't get 20 but 16. I also want to apologize for stating my screen timeout is set to 5 minutes. It's actually 3 minutes. I checked the rest (counted) and what I wrote previously is just about on target.  So the 70% yesterday night (actually a little over 70) was among the lowest I ever had on this phone.   I use this passport for work and it's the main way to get in touch with me. I listen to my landline Voicemail through it too. Not too many of those, perhaps 5 a week but strangely I had two voicemails yesterday. They came within two of the 16 email messages and were all under 1 minute long.  A fella at work has a classic, less than a week old. I'll ask him about his mileage tomorrow."

Camera - 10%; PIM services - 10%; Twitter, snap10, igrann, & bbm - 2-3% each.  This is very typical outside of battery saving mode as well, as I always keep the screen on the dimmest setting.

I have LTE turned on and power-saving mode turned off.  But I do have a Pebble, so I don't have to turn the phone's screen on to read texts; that saves a lot of power."
blackberry,39qyeu,Raptor007,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:49:21 2015 UTC,Using Q5 battery life is just about 16 hours even with low usage. This is something I feel Blackberry could have improved. Also certain software are intensely battery intensive like whatsApp. Continuously chatting for 2 hours on whatsApp drains it by 80%. I would have expected better.

The hub is great also.  On the other things like assistant seem to be a let down, doing certain things is more complicated or long winded than I am use to.   Really I argued with myself for months trying to list the reasons to go BB and the reasons not to. In the end I think I am just too use to the look, feel and overall brainwashing of my overlords at Google.  I hate being honest about this and I always hated IOS and Apple because their fanboys would say crap like: Apple just works.  But really that is kinda how it is now with Google and kinda how it needs to be in 2015. I understand an OS or form factor having possible growing pains but honestly I found the sacrifices too much given the main reason I wanted to go to BB was to cut all ties with Google/Android.  I would be more than willing to try and give BB a try again in the future because they were my first real smartphone and I loved my Curve back in 2008 and the Classic was a wonderfully nice feeling device but for me the hardware and OS/apps aren't were they should be really."
blackberry,39qi1q,_0x0_,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:17:49 2015 UTC,I feel you. I had an iPod touch that I used while traveling abroad for wifi. I was envious of a friend's blackberry they had (that keyboard) and decided to give it a try when I got back.  The hub is great! Best thing about the phone. The OS with its gestures is a nice thing. But the app gap is so large and the android apps crawl it becomes really hard to enjoy using it as anything more than text/email/calls.  I didn't really want an iPhone after I lost the iPod touch but I'm looking at them more now than before.  Maybe one day I'll switch. Going to use this blackberry till it dies probably though haha.

It allows developers to use Visual Studio, arguably the best development toolchain around, to develop applications that can be written once and run on iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Windows, and Mac OS X.  In my mind this solves their issue of not being able to get critical mass on the app front.  Perhaps with a Blackberry acquisition they could leverage the end to end IT solution of BES 12, Windows Phone, BB 10 for high security applications, etc."

If I were to spend $467 on a Passport and it wasn't absolutely brand new, I'd be pissed that I didn't spend another 20% to get a brand new one, because at that point you're already laying out a large amount of cash for an electronic device you expect to love and fit into your life for the next 2-3 years."

So if he got up to ten shots then he put some actual effort in to it. Going forward, may I suggest your not leave your $500 pocket computer with your irreplaceable data on it laying about when children are around.  Other tidbits that leave me squinting:   The ability to completely wipe the phone that easily is pretty much the most convenient thing ever for a phone theif.   First off, only an idiot steals a cellphone and tries to sell it for cash, because all smartphones these days can be remotely locked and disabled at the network level (Via BlackBerry Protect in this case, if you haven't set that up then yeah, that's your fault). As a result no one with a brain is in the business of stealing cell phones from people for the value of the unit itself, other than desperate opportunistic retarded thieves, and that group doesn't give a shit if your phone is password locked before trying to flip it on a street corner for $40. And if they can't sell it, it's getting tossed in a river or a dumpster. If your phone gets lifted, its gone, period. You're never getting it back, so who cares if your data got wiped before or after it hits the water? Besides, you have a backup, RIGHT?  These days the value of a stolen phone is what's INSIDE it. So lacking the automatic wipe, if some nefarious enterprising criminal did steal your phone and wanted to resell it overseas or something, they'll just hook it up via USB and brute force your shitty password, then steal all your personal data, sell it to Russian spammers and identity thieves, then wipe your phone anyway.   Literally anybody that gets a hold of your phone has the ability to completely reset it within a few seconds, for any reason whatsoever.   They can always do that, it's called ""dunking it in a glass of water"" or ""throwing it out the car window"". Seems like a good reason to keep all that precious personal data backed up!   Sometimes I go on my phone when I drink. Drunkenly trying to unlock my phone would yeild very bad results!   A lot of things are hard to do if you are getting shitfaced to the point of being utterly incapable of spelling. Regardless, see previous mention of the requirement of spelling out the manufacturer name after the 5th / 9th etc failed attempt, which would prevent this in such a circumstance. Also maybe stop drinking to the point of complete mental collapse?   TLDR; Back up your goddamn personal data and be grateful the manufacturer is looking out for you."

blackberry,39lj7j,tjgere,0,Sun Jun 14 16:48:45 2015 UTC,Actually I agree with OP. Sometimes you don't have personal data on your phone. Meaning data that no one could do any harm to you with. In those cases getting your phone wiped out even though its not stolen is bad.   There should be an alternative in place. bb system is understandable when you have personal or confidential data in place. Also backing up your data isn't quite a solution. How many times do you need to backup your data. Basically you would have backup everything everyday to be safe from this and even then you might lose some data. An alternative needs to exist.
blackberry,39lj7j,minusSeven,5,Sat Jun 13 06:02:42 2015 UTC,"I like the feature, but wish it was implemented a little more sanely. It would be nice if there was a mandatory cooling off period of like 6 hours after the first 10 failures, then 24 hours after the next 5-10 wrong... If you still can't get it after 20-30 tries over 24+ hours then factory reset it.  Going forward, with 10.3.2 the device will be tied to a BBID, if a phone is factory reset the only person that can reactivate the phone is the person in possession of the BBID. So it would essentially be a paper weight to a thief."
blackberry,39lj7j,pbeaul,4,Fri Jun 12 16:18:09 2015 UTC,Seriously? Downvotes for suggesting that it would be nice to have mandatory cooling off periods before resetting the device? Giving people 5 more guesses 12 - 24 hours after locking them out isn't going to compromise the security of the device. It will prevent friends/assholes from fucking with your phone and wiping it in a matter of 90 seconds of inattention.

blackberry,39im4g,pbeaul,7,Fri Jun 12 18:40:35 2015 UTC,"It is probably true, but it does not mean Blackberry plans on abandoning BB10.  I believe Blackberry owns a lot of patents regarding keyboards on mobile phones. They have an opportunity to leverage their patents to introduce an Android phone with a quality keyboard (which I do not believe already exists). It's incremental revenue for them. It's also a way to promote Blackberry to Android users. But what company makes any profit on Android phones, other than Google?  Chen could also introduce an Android Leap (whether it is an improved Android Runner on top of BB10 hidden from the user, or native Android). It would be a way to make economies of scale on manufacturing a form factor that is now a commodity (black glass rectangle) and where blackberry lacks the scale of its competitors on that market segment. It would be about lowering production costs.  Of the two, a Blackberry Android Leap is probably the most likely. It's a way to keep the keyboard exclusive to OS10, about lowering manufacturing cost per unit, and getting a small share of a large market to increase total Blackberry revenues.  But Chen also needs to reassure developers that he does not plan to drop BB10 for Android. If he doesn't make this clear, some developers will re-evaluate their investment in the OS. It could kill OS10's third-party market if this is not made clear very quickly.  Abandoning OS10 for Android would be suicide for Blackberry."
blackberry,39im4g,pbeaul,-2,Fri Jun 12 02:38:37 2015 UTC,"If this does happen, that's exactly what would have to happen. Blackberry can't become an ""approved"" Android manufacturer while it has it's own competing version of Android (which is what the Android support in BB10 is). It's 100% against the rules for anyone in the Open Handset Alliance, which is what is needed to get access to the Play Store/Google apps.   That means if BlackBerry even wants to test the waters it essentially needs to kill BB10 by getting rid of any Android support. There goes 60% (or more) of BlackBerry World apps, there goes amazon store, snap... BlackBerry effectively becomes a pure business phone and writing will be on the wall for BB10."
blackberry,39im4g,Oprah_Pwnfrey,4,Fri Jun 12 08:48:55 2015 UTC,"Believe it when I see it. This would effectively be the end of BlackBerry being known for security. Giving up control of the OS will make it impossible for them to guaranty anything security wise.   I don't even think it's possible for BlackBerry to join the OHA (Open Handset Alliance) so they they could gain access to the Play Store/Google Apps. They would have to abandon any Android forks which I'm going to guess would include BB10 android run-time...   If there is some kind of legal loophole that somehow allows them to circumvent the OHA rules of not being allowed to fork Android (very unlikely), the experience on Android will be seriously watered down compared to BB10. There's no way the Hub works anywhere close to as good as BB10... That level of integration can't be achieved with an app/skin, it's going to be a mediocre improvement on the existing notification system (which anyone else will be able to copy easily). The universal search is going to disappear, the concise gesture based UI/Navigation is largely going to disappear.  They only area that BlackBerry would be making a serious contribution in is the keyboard... Everything else will be a crappy knockoff of the BB10 version."
blackberry,39im4g,failtrepreneur,-1,Fri Jun 12 05:55:53 2015 UTC,"This would effectively be the end of BlackBerry being known for security   I really think that the only reason that Blackberry is considered secure is the lack of interest in finding its exploits. If the amount of people interested in cracking Android were interested in cracking BB10, you'd probably see similar levels of security.  Here's the thing - there are absolutely drawbacks of switching to android. But the one advantage (software compatibility) is literally the most important thing in an OS. And maintaining, updating, and marketing BB10 is a money pit. They cannot make any money selling BB10 devices.  I'd prefer an Android Blackberry to none at all, which will be the case if they keep pursuing BB10. Just look at the other dead platforms from much more capitalized companies. 3rd mobile platform is impossible."

I don't want Android and it will take a lot to convince me it's better. I'll be getting a Windows Phone and complete the transition. I've been waiting for a new device and if all I can look forward to is an Android with a keyboard I'll be disappointed. I know there are some here that want it, but I sure don't care for it. Software is the experience not the hardware for me. I don't think switching to Android will change BlackBerry's fortunes."
blackberry,39im4g,AcousticConfusion,3,Fri Jun 12 06:14:33 2015 UTC,Software is the experience   Software is the problem. If BB 10 could run every Android app they wouldn't be having to think about this.
blackberry,39im4g,eddy_07,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:18:41 2015 UTC,"I get that, but the majority of Android apps that don't work require Google Play Services. Some of those apps don't even need Google Play Services as there are Amazon versions without it. If BlackBerry changes any part of Android in this endeavor Google will deny them that too. Then what? I get that some apps don't work due to access to specific APIs that BlackBerry has not added to the runtime, but it's not impossible and they have done a lot in regards to that. Higher end hardware would also alleviate runtime lag and it's getting there. Especially if they can get discounts on Samsung Exynos chipsets. Either way this is why I would support a Samsung branded device with a BlackBerry experience app suite added on. It allows BlackBerry to enter this space without giving up on their own OS. I really hope this is the case even though it relies heavily on a close partnership with Samsung. It makes everyone happy and I'm all for choice. I would consider a Nexus device above a BlackBerry branded Android if I were to go Android, but, as I stated, I would like to see how Windows 10 develops instead. This is the best it's ever been for their mobile division and it looks very promising."

What do I care about being popular? I use what works the way I want to work. I use BlackBerry because of the way the OS is designed. The small features that I find important to the way I use a mobile device. I find it a joy to use and don't care what people think of that. I would switch to Windows due to the integration I already enjoy with my Windows computers and tablets. So having a Windows device is ""hipster"" now? What horse shit.

Will BlackBerry make one or some Android phones? Perhaps - but remember that the margins are already wafer-thin on Android devices and I don't see Mr. Chen steering the ship, full steam ahead, into waters as choppy as those.  For my part, I simply don't want the backward step in productivity that would come with a move to iOS/Android/Windows Phone (yes, I have used them all, and for me, BB10 is a clear winner). So, if I am wrong and the direction is all-Android from here, I will use my Z30 for as long as I can before switching to anything else (likely Windows Phone)."
blackberry,39ljgx,taliesynD,2,Sat Jun 13 05:08:02 2015 UTC,"Then the main reason I picked up a Q10 in the first place is gone. QNX.  I hope they don't bail already and stick it out.

blackberry,39ljgx,cpbills,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:52:43 2015 UTC,"I tend to be optimistic and believe that some of the early adopters of BB10 would have liked it enough to get more into development, instead of saying 'oh, I'll just use APK_X'.  That's just how I choose to see it. The development kit for BB10 is really nice, and when I went to play with it, was easier to get started than with Android development.

blackberry,39kzi3,minusSeven,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:17:04 2015 UTC,"One of the ways platforms become secure is by having large amounts of people try and find exploits. Then the developers know where to patch things up. Nobody does this with bb10. For that reason, I wouldn't be surprised if android is actually more secure than bb10 at this point.   BB10s great security may indeed just be purely a lack of hacker interest."
blackberry,39kzi3,minusSeven,2,Fri Jun 12 19:19:40 2015 UTC,"I will give you a very simply example. In android the game 2048 has a lot of permissions. Games usually don't need that many permissions. But in android you have no way denying those permissions(I hope that feature comes out soon, but that would break existing functionality). You may feel that those apps maybe spying on your personal data but only choice you have is not to install that app.   In blackberry app store the same app exists but in blackberry you have the option not allow any of those permissions and game still works flawlessly. This is one feature of blackberry android desperately needs. If Blackberry makes android phones they won't be able to add those features."
blackberry,39kzi3,minusSeven,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:17:38 2015 UTC,"Good example. Yes, a feature android needs.  Isn't there extra software available thought that would block those permissions? Isn't there all kinds of security software for android that provides those extensibilities - or even fools android into collecting the wrong data?  That software development community can solve any problem, like the one you just mentioned, or countless more. That's why it's so important."
blackberry,39kzi3,KneebarKing,2,Sat Jun 13 06:36:32 2015 UTC,Well in android thats usually the way to go. I think probably titanium backup has this functionality but that again needs rooted phone. If a functionality is needed an app usually comes up with that functionality. But it is something that the os should come up with.   Last time I was on android it didn't have a default file manager app. You could probably get over a million file managers in google play store but the question is why you should you rely on 3rd party app to do what is very much needed and should be provided by the os itself.   I could go on about many other things that blackberry does better than android. Thing is in blackberry these are things thought about and designed so the end user won't have to worry about it. In android each manufacture has their own way of going about it.

Even if you get a small fraction of android users to buy bb they would lose out most of their loyal users if they give away with bb10.
blackberry,39kzi3,garcia85,2,Sat Jun 13 08:14:28 2015 UTC,"How is this relevant to what I said?   Well, the thread we're commenting on is about the viability of Blackberry switching to android. So it's relevant to the thread, if not to your individual comment.   I don't care what most people in the world use.   You don't have to. But blackberry has to care, because profitability is only going to come from volume. And a lot of users do care about what other people are using - so they can use the same social software.   Even if you get a small fraction of android users to buy bb they would lose out most of their loyal users if they give away with bb10.    I'm betting that the small group of android users that switch would outnumber the loyal fanbase that abandons ship. I also think investing in android developers, android device management, and android security are all more useful ways to spend money than investing in the dying BB10. Those investments can pay off in other areas - like enterprise software and consulting.   They are 5 years too late in this.   Yes. To be honest, if I were in charge, we'd probably leave devices entirely and focus on something that is actually profitable.  Still, from a user's perspective I'll keep using BB10, and I'd buy an android blackberry."

Not because of security.   Do you honestly think it's because some hacker hasn't tried to bust in on BB10?   There are no users on BB10, so there is no incentive for any security firms, or hackers, or whatever to search for exploits. Nobody cares. Every piece of software has exploits, even BB10. They'll just never be discovered because nobody gives a damn.  Edit: one place did check   That post is ludicrous.    Funny - sometimes, when I make unfounded arguments, I throw out insults too."

Selling slider and flip phones may appeal to a very niche market which is great, but it just makes the company look so behind the times to the majority audience.   And before anyone says ""BlackBerry makes BUSINESS phones-- not phones for trendy young people""-- that's nonsense. BlackBerry clearly is making attempts to market themselves as Android/iOS competitors, so it's not as if they solely focusing on business people and government officials, with no care for anyone outside of those two markets."
blackberry,39d209,RationalArgumentMan,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:08:51 2015 UTC,"| If their only goal is to sell as many as phones as possible you're correct |  For the sake of their shareholders and employees, BlackBerry really needs to quit this ""we do it because we can"" business and start realizing that there's a reason why other companies have adopted the current phone design-- because it sells like hotcakes. Physical keyboards fit a very, very niche market and it's silly to try and push that design to people who've already got their minds made up. Very few people will switch from a touchscreen keyboard to a physical keyboard."
blackberry,39d209,RationalArgumentMan,3,Thu Jun 11 01:16:59 2015 UTC,"Would you chill? They have a keyboard phone and full touchscreen phones. To be honest, the physical keyboard is the only reason I'm giving this OS a chance. A larger display with a qwerty keyboard will be great for the market! (a display that isn't the size of a picture frame that is)."
blackberry,39d209,alaricus,5,Thu Jun 11 01:20:18 2015 UTC,"It is exactly what I have been waiting for. After the Z10 and Q10 dropped with no sign of a Torch replacement I ditched BB. I didn't see the point. Neither of those were what I wanted out of a phone and since I couldn't get what I wanted I went with another manufacturer. Now that the Torch is back, I will be putting cash on the counter again to support BB. I love their phones... I love their keyboard, but I want a full sized screen. I can't believe I'm the only one who feels that way."

blackberry,39d209,RationalArgumentMan,3,Thu Jun 11 05:10:49 2015 UTC,"adopted the current phone design-- because it sells like hotcakes   I don't disagree with your overall premise that BlackBerry needs to try to appeal to more consumers, but I do disagree with your statement above.  The form factor alone is not what sells phones.   If that were the case, then Windows Phone would be far further up the marketplace from where it is now and the Z10 and Z30 would be selling like hotcakes, as you put it.   Did you know that almost every Android OEM except for Samsung is losing money on Android phones? They're all slabs like you're asking for here, but they're losing money. Clearly the form factor isn't making them any more successful than if they tried something different.   Unfortunately, slab design has become a commodity. It's basic expected table stakes these days.   Conversely, when the Passport was announced, it immediately exceeded sales expectations, quickly selling out of the initial 200,000 units available.   So, what do we have here? Data very clearly shows that following the slab trend is a fast race to the bottom. On the other hand, the most recent attempt to do something different saw a sales boom for the company that did that different design.   For a company to actually break out and have a chance of success, something different needs to be done to differentiate it from the competition. Unfortunately for BlackBerry, producing slabs like the Z10 and Z30 only looks like a ""too little, too late"" ""me too!"" move to try to compete with Android and iOS.   So they need something different - something like the Passport. Something like the Slider. Something else as well, maybe. A horizontal slider? Another go at the BB flip phone? Who knows. But different is the only chance they have."

Having that all touch device for normal use but when I do want to actual write something pulling out that keyboard. We'll see if this wins out over the Passport2 for me. I miss my portrait slider, stuck with Palm for years so I wouldnt have to give it up.   The success of this device I think hinges more on its build quality and appearance than anything. This could be the big winner for BB. The Passport though I love it, its a bit too different for a lot of people to actually consider. Thing is though if Blackberry just releases a slab they WILL get lost in the sea of android devices, they have to stand out and the keyboard is one of their main strengths. This won't change consumers perceptions of BlackBerry for the worst, a large percentage of them believe as  you said, 5 years agobut I would argue that this has nothing to do with a slider, just the fact that most people haven't been introduced to BB10 and BB hasn't been doing a very good job at marketing. That and they haven't been releasing modern devices for t he large part recently.   Admittedly if they don't release a keyboard variant of this they are crazy."

When I had an Android it was good but the lack of apps made made it a little more difficult to use than iOS.  I love BlackBerry but the security is too tight (I'm sorry, I have to interject-- security is too tight? Come on dude, really?)-- if only there was a rooting or jailbreaking tool. I loved the keyboard, as it was by far the best-- I am currently searching for the typo keyboard now for my iPhone 5s.  Basically if you want me to classify mobile operating systems I would say Android is for the most advanced user-- not for the average Joe. (No clue what on Earth /u/moni11811 was trying to say in the next sentence)  iOS is for the average Joe that wants all those apps and access to a bunch of things, whereas Windows phones tend to have a good battery life that can last for 2 days (the Lumia 1520 lasted me 2 days on a full charge and then a 30 minute charge at the end left it at an 80% charge, which I think is amazing). GPS and maps also work flawless (presumably with Windows?).

blackberry,39aukd,missy789,2,Wed Jun 10 18:11:22 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your honest opinion. I have a Z10 so I can't speak from experience about the newest BlackBerry phones. That said, I agree almost point for point where your review overlaps with my phone model. It is my understanding that the Classic is an attempt to placate those professionals who are still using older devices, in the hopes of bringing them along to the 10.X era, as it were. With that said, your impression that it is a business oriented, no frills device makes sense.    One question: BlackBerry die hards swear by the physical keyboard and tool belt design that the Classic boasts. It's not that I don't believe you when you say that you find the keyboard a hindrance, it's just that I haven't ever heard anyone even suggest that, ever.

blackberry,39aukd,mcmanninc,2,Tue Jun 16 01:05:30 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for the Classic, but I can speak for the Passport.   The PKB on the Passport is indeed slower than typing on-screen is.   However, I attribute that to 3 things:   Stiff keys. They're not a joy to press, though they are getting easier/looser with time. This stiffness slows down responsiveness. The small chin on the International Passport makes holding the phone difficult and cramped in some positions. For instance, laying in bed, a horizontal touchscreen keyboard is far faster than the Passport's keyboard. This is the big one - the stupid decision to get rid of an Alt key and alt keyboard shortcuts. This slows down typing so much.  No longer is it purely muscle memory and quick tapping - to get to numbers, punctuation, or other symbols, you must now submit to the jumbled on-screen keyboard. Which really begs the question of why you wouldn't just go with one or the other in the first place. So stupid.    I have used a lot of QWERTY keyboards in the past, and this one is the worst. It's ironic, because I went in expecting it to be the best based on the innovative touch features and lots of user reviews.   Still, I do like the PKB overall, so don't mistake my critiques for outright contempt. I just don't understand why they so poorly redesigned the one thing they were known for nailing in the past."

To me, with the multiple textures, colors, and design principles, it looks like a hodge-podge of ideas - design by committee.   I'm not a fan.   The original Passport is a bold vision, and the AT&T version is a nice refinement of that vision. This one just bucked all of it for some weird checklist of items."

blackberry,399f4j,JuiceQube,2,Wed Jun 10 13:04:26 2015 UTC,Depends on what you want to do with it. If you want it as your daily driver I would safe up and buy a Classic. If you just want to take a look at the BB OS its fine. The Q10 is not the best performer in case of specs and screen size. But for the price and if it really is like new (check for third party cheap battery replacement) the deal should be ok.

blackberry,397isa,newfor2015,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:39:29 2015 UTC,"Why would BB need Android? Their OS is more secure, Android is completely open-source. BB 10 can even read Android .apk files, so there doesn't seem to be any reason to have a custom Android for BB. The one thing I notice about Android is your complete control over everything. Want to root your Android phone? Go right ahead, not too hard. And as much as I love Android for being completely open-source, it's definitely not as secure. BB is unique from the rest. The majority of other phones are running all sorts of variants of Android. BB 10 is Blackberry's own unique OS, it has all the things a Blackberry user would need. All the business centric stuff, the wonderful Hub, the gesture based navigation, and you can run Android stuff. For me, BB 10 is the best of both worlds. I get all the features I want from my Blackberry, and I get Android .apks. Hell, you can even run Nova Launcher on your BB device if you really hate BB 10. Point being, they don't need it. Their OS in the direction they want it to go. Blackberry don't need an Android base to build an OS, they've been doing this before everyone else, they just make their own. And to me, and I think it's safe to say the majority of BB users, this OS is the best OS I could have for my phone."
blackberry,397isa,newfor2015,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:36:10 2015 UTC,"Security.  The QNX-based BlackBerry OS10 is secured to your device at boot time.When the BBOS10 Boots, it matches encryption keys on the device before and during boot time. This allows for the OS-Level to stay inherently secure while providing the layers above it with the same trusted security. This has less to do with running android on the BlackberryHardware Platform, and more to do with the Hardware and Software being built for each other."
blackberry,397isa,eddy_07,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:38:32 2015 UTC,"Kind of... but I'm sorry to say, I don't think you really know what you're talking about. You're not even scratching the surface describing why a BB is more secure than any Android can ever be.  There's nothing to stop Android or any other platform from authenticating code before running anything, but that's the only reason why BB is more secure.   A Blackbery's security is multi-layered and fairly complex. It goes much beyond what the OS does, starts from manufacturing to activation to what happens when users turns on their phone... but let's just stick with the OS for the time being...  QNX's main benefit is that it's a micro-kernel OS, which means that it's kernel is very small, and 90% of the OS functionality are actually running as independent service processes, instead of as part one big monolithic piece of code. The benefit of this is that if one service process goes down, the rest of the system survives and that service may be restarted without a catastrophic crash. It also means that the OS is built to run processes in parallel, and supports multi-tasking from the OS all the way up to the apps layer, and so it can actually take full advantage of multi-core CPUs so the performance would be better.  It also means that each service can be isolated from each other, so that if someone install a malware process, it will have a hard time penetrating to another process, which makes effective malware difficult to write. THIS is what's fundamentally different about QNX than iOS, Android, Windows, etc. and there is nothing anyone else can do to change their OS to be like this, unless they re-write their OS from scratch."

One thing that really stuck out was that I've come to the unfortunate realization that the vast majority of phone reviewers, including MKBHD, don't review the BlackBerry OS in a sensible way.   Imagine if you took a lifelong OSX user and got them to use Windows 7 for a day, then got them to write a review. The review would be terrible and full of misinformation that may sound right to others who are unfamiliar with the OS. That is basically what I'm noticing when I watch BlackBerry reviews.  Anyway, so far I really like it-- the majority of complaints I have are simply due to the fact that I'm unfamiliar with the OS and that I have to learn about it.

Less mistakes with the PKB makes for a much more pleasant typing experience. Do it on a Passport with the word swiping and you will be in heaven.  3) Security - BlackBerry does it best.  4) Productivity - The OS is designed for it and all the little features make many tasks that are arduous on other platforms quick and easy on the BlackBerry.  5) BlackBerry Blend - leave your phone in your jacket and respond to text messages, emails, BBM, etc from your desktop PC, Mac, iPad, Android Tablet, you name it.

Here's a comparison video of the Z30 and the iPhone typing the same message; Z30 + predictive keyboard is a beast.  I also really like the toast notifications where you can answer a text or BBM within a different app. I dunno if Android already has that though.

blackberry,38z14l,undercovergangster,7,Mon Jun 8 02:25:08 2015 UTC,"For me, it's the keyboard shortcuts on devices with physical keyboards. For example, these are the ones I often use while I'm in the Hub:   U next unread message C to compose a new message R to reply L to reply all T to go to the top"
blackberry,38z14l,alphaque,4,Mon Jun 8 08:43:46 2015 UTC,"I don't do a lot of emails, but I'm always happy with how quick and easy it is to respond to a text or email while doing something else on the phone. For example reading or writing on reddit, if a message came through, a little window would pop up at the top of the screen. I can read the first two lines of the message, or tap on it if I want to respond, and reply without having to change screens at all.   With the hub, all messages from all synced accounts are in one spot. Really handy to. See what's happening. Each source has it's own dedicated folder too so you are not overwhelmed with a flood of spam if there are a lot of communications going on."
blackberry,38z14l,mistakenideals,3,Mon Jun 8 02:36:13 2015 UTC,Android and iOS both have the popups for emails as well though. And the notification bar sort of works just like the HUB.  EDIT: Still not fully convinced. I agree it would be useful but it is essentially just a notification Centre. Android has a widget that would allow you to see all of your notification history at the tap of the screen.
blackberry,38z14l,undercovergangster,9,Mon Jun 8 02:38:32 2015 UTC,"You're right about the popups.  The Hub, on the other hand, is a lot different. Imagine the Android/iOS notification centre, but with a single compose button at the top of your messages and a built-in reader for all of your communications. It replaces all of your communications apps, in a supremely efficient interface, accessible anywhere on the system. Once you use the Hub, you will never want to go back."
blackberry,38z14l,andrelegare,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:50:16 2015 UTC,"Once you use the Hub, you will never want to go back.   I dunno. It has its uses, but I hate how it doesn't sort things out like the native Gmail application on Android.   Since Gmail added that sorting feature last year between Personal emails, Social emails, and Commercial emails, my Gmail inboxes have become soooo streamlined!  Hub undoes all of that though.   It just dumps everything into the main hub and the individual mailbox hubs.   It's definitely a step back when I now have to sort through every email instead of only the important ones.   Plus, I don't need an alert in the Hub every time a song changes on Pandora. It's obnoxious.   And, worst of all, there is no way to get rid of some notifications.   There was a Facebook event on Saturday that the event organizer had set as all day Saturday and all day Sunday.   There was no way to remove that stupid alert after the set time. There needs to be a way to easily dismiss them, but there isn't.  The Hub is a good idea on paper, but it feels like a beta project right now. It's not quite ready for prime time and needs further revisions to make it truly useful and not merely novel."
blackberry,38z14l,by_a_pyre_light,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:35:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone is claiming it's the perfect solution for everyone. It definitely lacks some of the functionality of some dedicated apps (your example GMAIL) but that is far from making it a beta.   I was getting notifications from a couple of apps I didn't need/want so I just switched them off. I still get the spark on the icon, so I know something is there.  I don't know enough about Facebook but that may very well be possible to.   I think it's the best overall solution for keeping on top of your electronic communications.  I hated the in/out/in/out of Android and always felt I was going to overlook something.   I seriously don't know why other platforms don't have hubs equivalents. Or, if there is an alternative that performs as well, or even half as well, I'd love to know."
blackberry,38z14l,mcmeekle,2,Mon Jun 8 16:29:45 2015 UTC,"Or, if there is an alternative that performs as well, or even half as well, I'd love to know.   Well, the drop down notifications tray on iOS and Android work very, very well for this. You can get notifications and ignore them. You can swipe to quickly remove any communication from any app. So that notification issue I mentioned? Not a problem on Android.   Couple that with the enhanced Gmail experience on Android, and it's genuinely faster when trying to be productive. Plus, on Android, when searching for an email, it automatically searches all local emails on the device, plus those on the server. On BlackBerry, it asks me every time if I want to search the server. It should just do that automatically. Data speeds are generally fast enough now that it's nearly instantaneous, and it's a better seamless user experience than breaking out the steps.  The advantage of Hub here is that it's always a swipe or two away and it's faster to load than switching to the dedicated email app on Android. But again, the experience of using it is less productive than the drop-down drawer and the enhanced Gmail experience because it drops every notification from everything into the Hub. By the time I switch to the dedicated program hub and sort through junk mail, it would have been faster just to launch my Gmail app or text messaging app on Android.   These issues make Hub feel more like a beta product. It's clearly based on a sound idea, but it feels like BlackBerry didn't look at the things that truly exceed it on other platforms and instead rushed it out the door based only on the ideas of where it has benefits vs. the competition, rather than looking at the complete picture to come up with a holistic project.   With some refinements, it could be the single best experience on any device."
blackberry,38z14l,by_a_pyre_light,2,Mon Jun 8 16:42:58 2015 UTC,"How you use Gmail is different to how I use Gmail, so if the extra layers that the Gmail app has makes you more productive, that's great. You dislike the way you're asked to search the server each time, but there's an argument for both sides. BlackBerry have always valued data, so I'm not surprised the default is ask first. Maybe they're out of step on that. Who knows? Maybe 10.3.2 will give you the choice to set it the way you want it.   I've heard the argument that the Android notification shade is better or at least on a par with the Hub before. I cannot buy into it.  It works in a similar fashion up to a point. Then the notifications disappear and your messages are scattered into their respective apps. Because that is all they are/were: notifications. The Hub contains the actual messages. That's the difference."
blackberry,38z14l,mcmeekle,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:12:20 2015 UTC,"BlackBerry have always valued data   What does that mean? Are you talking about conserving data plan allotments or about data privacy?   your messages are scattered into their respective apps. Because that is all they are/were: notifications. The Hub contains the actual messages. That's the difference.   Yes, I know that. But a notification should only be a notification. So that way, I can get rid of it quickly and it doesn't incessantly annoy me.   The Hub's issue is that the notifications come from everywhere and there are only so many icons and ways to ignore them. Then, because it drops everything into the main Hub, it's less productive. I either have to sort through the main Hub, or I have to search for the specific Hubs.   On Android, if I get a Facebook notification, I can quickly swipe right to get rid of it. That's it, it's gone. On BB OS10, I can never get rid of the notification until I've specifically gone into that app's hub and physically clicked on each notification. It's stupid. All notifications are treated equally, but I doubt even you would argue that all notifications are equal."

blackberry,38z14l,kol13190,2,Mon Jun 8 01:49:27 2015 UTC,What they mean by communication is that you actually communicate a lot. Like always using Twitter or have a lot of.communications going at the same time or always responding to emails. If you're a person who may receive an email every once in a while  or maybe just a few texts throughout the day then it's not entirely that amazing for the average person. It really is meant for someone who is always always communicating and always on the go. It is extremely versatile on its own and can perform extremely well against the other major mobile phone players. They always talk about needing more ram or speed.- but honestly once you get to the point where you're sending a text message all the time exactly what good is all that extra ram doing. I need the OS to operate really well. That's what blackberry offers and it's OS is very good at resource usage. Best of luck in your evaluations.

For both ios and android there is something really similar to blend."
blackberry,38z14l,dirtnapper75,2,Mon Jun 8 03:23:33 2015 UTC,"iOS has certainly come a long way security-wise and Android is getting better. Device encryption is really just one component of security.  BlackBerry does a lot more security-wise and has several certifications required by many banks and governments that competitors simply cannot meet.  As for productivity apps, BlackBerry supports a lot of functionality right ""out of the box"" without a need to install third party apps. Does iOS even have a file manager yet? Deal breaker for me personally. Unzip files, open PDF's, office documents, BlackBerry Travel, Remember - all supported on BB10 out of the box.  iOS and Android may have something similar to Blend but, again, it is third party applications with little to no security validation and most of those only really handle texting. Blend is like a portal your whole phone - messaging, calendar, contacts and file manager.

Ios has something similar to blend w/o third parties, and you can still download blend for both android or ios.

About 5-8? The cloud hack of celeb photos? The fingerprint scanner which a 12 year hacked in under an hour? The new text hack which I'm not sure has been patched yet.  What makes android lose security is its quite known as a malware device. And it's mostly open source so you can do many things with it. Good or bad. Which leads to all sorts of exploits. Knox is Samsung only. They were having a problem making it secure enough to try getting into enterprise. Much is to be believed that the Samsung and BlackBerry partnership was for Knox security and hardware for BlackBerry. Speculation, but that new BlackBerry Slider looks quite similar (but nicer) than the Galaxy S6 Edge.  Then there's the Blackphone which runs on top of Android who promise they'd knock BlackBerry out of their niche market. They never got anywhere and even had a massive security flaw last year.  End of the day, use whatever you like.

The cloud iirc was more of a human error. Touch id wasn't really hacked, they still needed your fingerprint and it was more like a trick, they didn't directly bypass it. Should have been patched.  Malwares aren't really a problem if you have common sense as apps can't be installed without you knowing and it also gives you the list of permissions that apps needs. Customization and openness of android are not really a problem as they require direct human interaction and can't be done remotely unless rooted and with xposed (user's choice), so if your device is encrypted it's just as secure. Iirc knox has been also implemented in stock KK.

The Hub is simply too cool, and I'd urge you to take a look at what that's all about. Briefly, it puts all of your communications in one spot. Very easy and efficient."

I do miss widgets from android but the way blackberry does things you simply won't find the need for it in most cases.These are thing well thought out.

blackberry,38z14l,countpuchi,3,Mon Jun 8 06:05:55 2015 UTC,I definitely like to support Canadian businesses but would never purchase an inferior product simply because it was Canadian. I wouldn't encourage anyone to do so.   I choose BB10 because it is a superior product for my purposes. the fact that it is Canadian is a nice bonus.
blackberry,38z14l,countpuchi,2,Mon Jun 8 09:31:00 2015 UTC,"3 things.   BBOS 10 number 1 feature that blows android and ios away..   True multitasking. Seriously people shut up when I can play my music and read reddit at the same time. They be like how come iphone and android cant do that. Well, you can find good stuff in shiny things most of the time.   BBHub   For someone who communicates a lot I find bbhub the best and the other phones simply cant compete with it. Its a lot if work just to use android or iphone to communicate.   Build Quality.   I dont know how many times ive dropped my phone and didnt crack my screen. Besides that sound quality is top notch.

blackberry,38z14l,by_a_pyre_light,5,Mon Jun 8 06:58:05 2015 UTC,"He might mean listening to music on YouTube? BB10 does support playing YouTube videos in the background natively, which I don't think android / ios does (they will pause the video upon switching apps)"
blackberry,38z14l,biznatch11,6,Mon Jun 8 09:33:09 2015 UTC,"Yup thats what I meant, using you tube. Sorry if I didnt clarify bout it sooner."
blackberry,38z14l,by_a_pyre_light,3,Mon Jun 8 10:28:06 2015 UTC,That's a design choice by the designers of the Android YouTube app not a limitation imposed by the OS. I have other video playing apps that can play in the background just fine.
blackberry,38z14l,pbeaul,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:52:28 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter who's at fault. The simple fact of the matter is that it's a huge limitation in Android. I'm so excited about being able to run YouTube videos in the background, it's hard to explain what a huge benefit that is to me.   On Android, most of the music apps don't have the latest songs or remixes that I like that I can easily find on YouTube. If I want to listen to a debate or podcast, I can find them all on YouTube without having to download a different app or try to find them on a site within the browser, which then may or may not still require a link to an app to play them in.   It's all perfectly seamless within YouTube. So, on Android, I would have to leave the screen up, subjecting it to random video skips, pauses, accidental hits of the ""back"" button, hitting other videos in the list below the main video, etc. Plus, it was killing my battery crazy fast.  Now, I can listen to music, podcasts, debates, etc. without the screen on, and without even running YouTube as the only app I can access.   It's a huge advantage for me."
blackberry,38z14l,biznatch11,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:39:11 2015 UTC,"If we're talking about just the Youtube app then yes it looks like as of now BB has the advantage. But the issue isn't the Youtube app, it's about the original comment that claimed that only BB can play music in the background because of some inherent advantage of the BB OS over Android/iOS (""True multitasking"" as the commenter says, whatever that means) .  My point was that's not true at all, it's just a weakness of the Android Youtube app maybe because it's part of some paid service. If I was a regular Youtube user on Android yes I'd be pissed, and I wouldn't care who's fault it is I'd just want it to work.  But I was addressing the bigger issue of ""True multitasking"" which was being claimed as a BB-only feature, when really it exists in both Android and BB."
blackberry,38z14l,69hailsatan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:57:42 2015 UTC,"Eh, that YouTube Music Key is a beta product that's unknown to the vast majority of users. I'd never heard of it until you linked it, and they don't publicize it. I think it's unfair to pin the blame on that since it's a beta product in a minimal trial run and it's only been around about 6 months as it is. The issue has existed far longer than that.    But I was addressing the bigger issue of ""True multitasking"" which was being claimed as a BB-only feature, when really it exists in both Android and BB.   And I was only addressing the YouTube bit where you were claiming it wasn't a limitation of the OS. As it stands, it's a limitation on the OS, and the technical details are fairly irrelevant to the end user, you know?"
blackberry,38z14l,ohyeahbonertime,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:16:38 2015 UTC,"Despite the music example, Android in the past has never been a true multi-tasking OS. Android L has improved things significantly, but it's still behind BB10 as far as multi-tasking goes. It 100% is an OS limitation, the reason why music is an exception is because Google was able to code around the limitations in ways that normal app developers can't (might no longer be an issue since Android L).  In Android/iOS when an app leaves the foreground the application state is saved in memory and effectively frozen in place/shut down. This causes some issues when you try to thaw/revive the application, often times it will not resume exactly where you left off. This isn't the case with BB10, the apps continue to run as expected they are just no longer visible... Which is effectively what allows the youtube video to keep playing."
blackberry,38z14l,69hailsatan,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:40:30 2015 UTC,"Forgive me I may not understand the technical definition of multitasking but from a user perspective that's what my Android phone seems to be doing.  I have all sorts of apps running in the background, mostly communication apps like BBM, Skype, Facebook Messenger, and email, but also things like Tasker and Greenify, Google Maps continues to give directions when I switch to another app, while YouTube doesn't play in the background (again, a limitation of the app not of the OS) the video app I usually use (MX Player) specifically has a ""play in background"" option.  I can also actually multitask and have two apps open at the same time in a split screen, like Reddit on one half of the screen and a video playing on the other half.  The video app that comes with my phone has a ""picture in picture mode"", you can turn the video into a little window that you can drag around the screen.  Combined with the split screen windows I could have three videos playing at the same time if I wanted to.  Or reddit, Firefox, and a video all onscreen at the same time.  Of course at this point the small screen size makes this not too practical, but isn't this multitasking?  My understanding is that apps that get frozen in memory stay there until the memory is needed.  I've never had a problem resuming an app from memory.  They're only kicked out of memory when there's no memory left and the memory is needed.  Given the option between the phone freezing because it ran out of memory and closing whichever app hasn't been used in the longest time, I'll choose the latter.  And this is all on my Android 4.2 phone, an OS version which is 2 years old at this point."
blackberry,38z14l,ohyeahbonertime,2,Mon Jun 8 21:00:17 2015 UTC,"1) Largest app selection, you get the BlackBerry World, which of course is BlackBerry version of the andorid and ios app store, the Amazon store is also preloaded, and on top of that you have the option of downloading the play store for three whole app stores, you can also add 1mobile1 too but I think those three are good enough  2) there's nothing like the hub, you can't download an app or there isn't a feature on any other platform that has the BlackBerry hub features, if you have a ton of notifications, emails, messages from all of your sites, it's the best way to keep them all organized in one place.  3) best in class typing experience, they're the only ones really making physical keyboard phones, which are superb, but the virtual all touch keyboard is also amazing. My wpm on a BlackBerry is actually higher than a regular keyboard.  4) variety. BlackBerry releases different phones, when I mean different I don't mean one phone that has good specs and another identical with ok specs. They release phones that look and just wow. The passport brought an all new design and a new touch keyboard. The upcoming BlackBerry slide will be dual curved as well as a slider.    5) Quality, even the low end BlackBerry feels and looks kind of premium, it doesn't feel like just an add on phone trying to get a couple more sales.    6) innovative, underdogs are always the most innovative ones, BlackBerry and windows phone are so different than the big 2"

My One S was getting dog slow. Part of that is the OS, and BB is faster than Android, but part of it is the march of technology - more, faster, better computing power means that app developers develop toward the higher spec and the OS gets designed with that in mind too. So the slower chip with less RAM will definitely be felt."

While BB10 does have android run-time capabilities (can run Android apps), that's different from Google Play Services. Android is free/open source software, anyone can download and customize it for their purposes (which is what RIM/Blackberry had to do to integrate it into BB10). The Google apps/play services are proprietary and only available to members of the Open Handset Alliance. In order to be part of that alliance you need to follow a bunch of rules that essentially restrict you from Competing against Google with their code, basically you can't use the Google Apps (Gmail, Hangouts, Play Store, etc) if you take the Android code and make a bunch of customization to it."

blackberry,38xgu9,biznatch11,10,Sun Jun 7 20:11:53 2015 UTC,"""Several android and ios apps"" that's exactly the point, on other platforms you need several apps to cover what the hub does on bb10.   The keyboard is a bit of an adjustment, but honestly, I wouldn't go back to anything.   I was disappointed when the classic was released with a standard 4 row, and apparently the slider will be as well. 3 row capacitive is the way forward.   Also consider checking out one of the blackberry all touch phones. The virtual keyboard is simply the best one on any mobile device. Period."
blackberry,38xgu9,IronChefJesus,4,Sun Jun 7 19:04:40 2015 UTC,"on other platforms you need several apps to cover what the hub does on bb10.    I don't think that's what the OP is saying.  I think they are saying there are several apps that are like the BB hub, and any one of those apps by itself could be used to get the same functionality as the Hub.

blackberry,38xgu9,venderhain,6,Sun Jun 7 22:22:53 2015 UTC,"This is probably the worst place to post this, but then again, maybe I'm looking for some counterarguments to justify keeping it. I loved my BB Curve way back when, and bought a Passport hoping I'd love it, too.   If you loved your Curve, the Classic would probably be more on the nose.    I got the phone because of its promotions touting productivity, however, it's no different than the latest Android or IPhone in that regard.   Get outta here. Just the battery life alone puts it ahead. Not to mention the integration with BlackBerry Link and Blend.    Blackberry Hub can easily be replaced by several Android and IOS apps that do the same thing.   Not really. You can get close. But, unless it is first party, it isn't the same. Managing messaging is a joke, especially on iOS.    The physical keyboard just takes up space. I thought I missed it, but it actually requires more effort to use than a virtual keyboard and in the long run seems to contribute to the development of carpal tunnel. Virtual keyboards have a better, larger, layout.   That's what the Z30 is for.    The camera is terrible. The autofocus is slow and inaccurate.   Weird comment to make. Maybe, you need to turn off facial recognition and tap to focus...?   I don't typically put any phone in my pocket, but I sometimes need to--this phone is a horribly square shape that feels uncomfortable even for a few minutes.   Get looser pants. I can see your balls. LOL   The keyboard acting like a touchpad is a cool gimmick, but doesn't work very well in practice. Sliding up creates all kinds of accidental commands.   It learns you as you learn it. But, that takes time.     I am sad to send this otherwise beautiful and unique phone back. I feel like I'm adding another tiny nail to BB's phone business. Maybe it's time to let go.   Maybe. But, you really have to give it time. If you never try to get acclimated, you're going to go through a lot of phones."

blackberry,38xgu9,duane534,4,Mon Jun 8 15:25:18 2015 UTC,There is nothing like the BlackBerry Hub. Nothing. Don't kid yourself. If you honestly think several apps can take the place of the HUB and that's acceptable then you probably never needed to use the hub to its full potential. I'm thinking you should just get whatever makes you happy and be done with it. Your reasons for returning the Passport sounds more like you are trying to convince yourself to get something more mainstream.
blackberry,38xgu9,eddy_07,2,Mon Jun 8 15:41:51 2015 UTC,Coming from iPhone and Android I have never seen an app that acts exactly like the hub at most you can consolidate emails and messages but unless it is 1st party I doubt the app is able to access messages from other apps. Also Blend and the auto-complete along is enough to boost your productivity vs the other 2 platforms.
blackberry,38xgu9,choaniki,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:58:43 2015 UTC,"Well the point of the hub is so you don't have to have several apps because its all aggragated into the one app. So you're you're right there...in a way. Also i haven't come across any messaging app to offer the triage. Maybe theyre out there but then i would need to find a foursquare/facebook/multiple emails/ twitter/ instagram/ bbm(assuming you use it) and open each one individually instead of just opening the hub, mark all as read, done.  The keyboard is smaller than a landscape keyboard but there's no way you'll find a portrait keyboard with a wider layout. Also, in landscape its taking up screen real estate(as opposed to pocket space) so you're left looks at like 2 lines of text.  Additional reasons i like the keyboard are... - tactile feedback -i'm most definitely more accurate especially with making making edits just double tap the keyboard and use it as a track pad and your finger isn't in the way when you're moving the cursor - the shortcuts are the absolute best. Need to find on page press ""s"" you just saved yourself 3-4 seconds from opening a menu. Reload? ""L"" another 4 seconds forward and back ""n""ext and ""p""revious. History? ""H"" they might seem daunting to memorize but they show you when you open your menus so you pretty much become more efficient the more you use the phone. -pressing and holding a key on the homescreen works as app shortcuts so you dont gotta go digging around your folders - start typing to search. Typing on the homescreen will automatically do a universal search. That means internet as well as local data. This alone has saved me literally hours of time and i got my passport in april.  -also anywhere else theres a search like your browser history for example: open browser>h>type way faster then digging into menus. - in addition, everytime you have to wait for the virtual to pop up thats like another 2 seconds. Every single time. Think about how many times you gotta type something. - once you're accustomed to the keyboard the gestures are less gimmicky and more second nature - i just typed this whole stupid thing in less than 10 minutes.  Tl;dr - i would give it more time before you jump the gun op it sounds like you might not be using it to it's full potential if all you care about is flicking words onto the screen.  Also, the 90's were straight garbage. You got me there."
blackberry,38xgu9,akiva23,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:55:51 2015 UTC,"It just depends on what you value the most: 1. The hub really can't be easily replaced. And once you're used to it, it can be impossible to consider giving up--it spoils you. 2. The ability to control app permissions--you won't find that in an Android. How much does your privacy mean to you? 3. The ease of multi-tasking without actually clicking around to switch screens--you just slide back and forth. 4. The ease of reading web articles on a wider screen. Or, for that matter, skipping the applicable app, and simply going to the website. Everything is a trade-off though. The ease of reading means the wider phone.  But if you don't like it, you're better off with a different phone!"

The only time I find the PP size annoying is pulling it out of jeans while I am driving, but then I had the same problem with my last GNote.   More annoying is that the button on top is too easily pressed and stuff can happen in the pocket.   Genuinely curious what you do instead of putting it in your pocket - do you have a bag or backpack you prefer to use?    Camera autofocus is stupid slow and misses too often.  Pics are great when in focus though.  I find that I have to 'prime' the camera with a couple of throwaway shots and then it starts behaving better.  Map sucks, it's the worst stock app IMO.   I love the keyboard touch+swipe.  I love the hub.  Can't find anything on android like it.  Love the simplicity of BB10.   It's like stock android, but done right."
blackberry,38xgu9,layzpcofcrap,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:43:28 2015 UTC,Tbh you need to give it more time to learn the kb. Took me about a month or so to get good at not needing to look where I type. Same with swiping on it: don't touch the screen when you do so. Tip: swipe backward to delete full words and swipe up down to scroll webpages or docs.

You are not selling many of them anyway, at least make them affordable so people like me can just buy them to try them, perhaps at $400? That's more like it.

So far, this issue hasn't been reported on AT&T version. I have been calling AT&T asking if they have any refurb units for lower price, no luck either.

I am more concerned about the quality of the non-AT&T models, screen lifting has been a problem that is reported very frequently. So far it's only been an issue on unlocked models.

blackberry,38vgdm,_0x0_,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:22:38 2015 UTC,"Right on! It's ridiculous to be able to buy a new Passport on Amazon for a little over $500 and be looking at one from ATT for $650--and especially, as you say, since they aren't selling many, and we know dxmn well they bought them for far less than $650--they can afford to sell them for less. (And by the way, even if you buy them on contract, they still get you for the $650--they just get their $$ over time instead of up front.)"

Have you considered the Passport? Why not get both large screen and keyboard? I've played with a passport for a few days and the screen is huge compared to my Q10.

Currently there isn't an easy way for me.  Example would I am driving and want to find the nearest Texas roadhouse based on where I am at.   Currently the assistant doesn't do that but might list random locations in my city so it becomes luck if the one I might want is in the list.   Another example would be say I need a phone number of a store and I know the road the store is on is near me I used to be able to just search Google maps for the nearby store then call them. Currently as it stands now I need to search Google on the Web under my city but no GPS support.   I won't install android apps so that route is out. I guess I am asking if there is an app that allows for accurate GPS searches that I can use for phone numbers directions etc.   I am trying to explain best I can but my words seem to be failing me. I am sorry for that. Hope someone can help though.
blackberry,38ooir,tossaway0000000,6,Fri Jun 5 16:14:18 2015 UTC,Snapchat is a no go. There are apps for instagram.  As far as facetime. Using bbm you can voice chat but since she doesn't have a blackberry you won't be able to video chat. Two solutions come to mind. 1. Use Skype 2. Get her a BlackBerry.

blackberry,38ooir,andey,5,Sat Jun 6 13:24:38 2015 UTC,Passport owner here. I love this device it's built like a tank and runs like a Bugatti. The Android app situation isn't bad. Most apps work and when they do they run like they are native. Google material design blends in well with BlackBerry 10 and most apps based  on it format well to passports screen.   I say take the leap man and get a Passport. It's a great device and BlackBerry 10 is an awesome OS. Also it has some of the best speakers on any phone out their. I use mine as a boom box at work.
blackberry,38ooir,The_Shivs,3,Fri Jun 5 19:07:02 2015 UTC,"Android Instagram works fine.    Snapchat is... odd. You can get the Android version or Caspar like someone else mentioned but if Snapchat detects that you're using a BlackBerry then they'll suspend/ban your account cause its an unauthorized platform. (Yet they won't make a BlackBerry app...go figure)   BBM will only offer voice. No video chat yet but I think that's in the works, though I wouldn't depend on it. Skype is probably your best bet."
blackberry,38ooir,WiFiForeheadWrinkles,2,Fri Jun 5 18:39:22 2015 UTC,I was in your shoes a few months ago. I had an iphone 6plus and before that a mixture of android and iphone devices. Switching to the passport has given me so much joy. As long as you're not a heavy mobile gamer or snapchat user you will be fine with the assortment of usable android apps.   I have yet to come across a reason to go back to an iphone.
blackberry,38ooir,ThaCarterr,3,Fri Jun 5 20:41:22 2015 UTC,"The passport will run apps from the BlackBerry App World and the Amazon android app store. What you'll want to do is get Snap, a Google store client that will let you run most android apps(unless they specifically use Google services) , and they do run quite well. The only two issues you mention are SnapChat (SnapChat doesn't have a BlackBerry App, their Android app blocks BlackBerry users and they actively shut down third party clients,) and face time. Bbm has cross platform voice calling, but the cross platform video calling that was promised over a year ago seems to have been forgotten. The Skype app does work well though.   Of course, if you convince your wife to get a BlackBerry, bbm's video calling works quite well."

blackberry,38ooir,KneebarKing,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:04:04 2015 UTC,"Got that.   It's this ""business"" phone non-sense that makes people steer away from BlackBerry. Business it neither ""fun"" nor sexy.  The BlackBerry marketing team has always been rather lame and embarrassing.  It's not really that BlackBerry has ""better"" security. It HAS security, while others don't have any. It's like deciding whether to buy a car with or without an airbag. It's completely irrelevant whether you're a ""business"" person or not. It's an airbag."
blackberry,38ooir,bonerconfusion,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:36:51 2015 UTC,"It is a business phone, and these days that is exactly what they are hoping people see. The marketing for BlackBerry has shifted from consumer to corporate, as that is where their strength and base is. The days of marketing BlackBerry as a fun device are gone, my friend. I won't argue that the marketing team has sucked it up a lot in the past, but they have a corporate vision nowadays.  BlackBerry also does have better security, because Android and Apple do have security architecture in their OS's. There is a reason why BlackBerry gets DoD and Pentagon security certificates and Apple and Google do not. The competition just has an inferior product for mobile security."

blackberry,38ooir,AnAwesomeMiner,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:46:46 2015 UTC,"Passport user here. Quick (mostly) point by point rundown:   Don't upgrade if you're taking the flat discount with 2-year contract. $15/month over 2 years is generally more than the difference between promo and contract price. Mine definitely fits fine in my pockets, and has survived a few drops on concrete and tiles without even a scratch (on the metal frame/bumper). Hands down the best browser I've used on any phone, and the real estate makes for much less pinching and zooming or scrolling. My progression was Palm Pre+ >> iPhone 4s >> LG G2 >> BB Passport. Unless I am mistaken, /u/WiFiForeheadWrinkles is still right about BBM not doing video. When I tested it, I found that it tore through my Android battery, too. Haven't tried Skype or Google Voice. Android apps don't really convert to BB apps; they run as themselves inside BB10. It's like when you run Flash or Java in your browser, that's a separate platform on top of your computer. That also means you'll be using Android controls like swiping from the left to open menus, etc.   Overall I am happy with mine and have no intentions of going back. I found that people just texted me when they found out I didn't have Snapchat anymore. This 30-plus hour battery life is pretty clutch, too, and if you have corporate email access Balance is way better than native iOS integration or Good for Enterprise ever was for me. Hope this helps!"

The linked article talks about several different things (it apparently acts like a standard removable storage device? And then it says something have having NFC and an antenna? And an example secure chat program?), and I'm not clear on what exactly it does.  Also:   They went with the micro SD form factor so that they could have more data throughput to project video, and they wanted storage (Vault has 4GB of data storage on board) and they wanted modularity, so you could take it wherever you wanted.   Does that mean that it is essentially a MicroSD card? Or just that it is in the same shape as a MicroSD card? And the picture in the article says it has a 64GB capacity, but the part of the article I quoted says it only has 4GB?"
blackberry,38e3uv,krudler5,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:15:15 2015 UTC,If anything this seems like something I would want in my BlackBerry. And this device is only going to create a secure space not secure the device. Android and IOS for that matter still haven't solved the security issues caused by their bootloader. So if  this product comes to market it won't be a threat to BlackBerry as they will likely still have the only secure mobile OS. It would be nice to have a device like this though. I never encrypt my SD card on my BlackBerry out of fear that my device might get wiped or fail. (actually happened last night!) This little bugger would eliminate that issue.

blackberry,388ffd,minusSeven,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:53:11 2015 UTC,"While this was never in doubt, the way they're phrasing it worries me.  Does that mean we're getting close to the end of software support life for early BB10 phones?  Will they not get the next big update, or the one after that?  Considering the Z10 and Q10 have basically the same specs as the Classic, a current gen phone, I don't see them stopping support any time soon, but it worries me that they're making such a big deal about this."
blackberry,388ffd,Baconwich,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:08:43 2015 UTC,"I bet they will put in a end of life date somewhere in two to three years for the q10 and z10, but after they launched a new phone somewhere late this year/beginning next year (slider?). Lack of sales is somewhat of an issue for BB, people not moving towards newer models because the old ones are just as great is quite a unique problem in this section of the market."

That and the music cover art sometimes doesn't refresh on the active frame when the song changes."

If you feel comfortable beltless, I would recommend a new much cheaper q10 from ebay or amazon over a classic. Is there a passport that works on verizon? Hell of a phone in comparison to those two. I rocked the q10 for a year and a half and really liked it, classic did not impress in comparison and the passport blew both out of the water."
blackberry,38aiid,jonasbeaver,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:13:14 2015 UTC,"Is it that the classic didn't impress in comparison because it was the same as the Q10?  I'm due for an upgrade with Verizon and I can get a Classic for $100, else I'd have to buy a new Q10 for maybe $180.  No Passport for Verizon, unfortunately."

blackberry,38aiid,jonasbeaver,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:19:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should have clarified, the guts are exactly the same, the form factor has a belt. I do occasionally miss the belt though it's less and less after years on the q10 and passport."
blackberry,38aiid,duane534,2,Sat Jun 6 07:55:16 2015 UTC,"Hi. Verizon rep here, albeit personal opinion. The Classic is a gorgeous piece of hardware. Much in the same way that the Z30 is what the Z10 should have been, the Classic is what the Q10 should have been. Metal band is nice. Double clicking Back to exit apps is a God send. And, the screen is big enough."
blackberry,38aiid,-rogo-,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:23:59 2015 UTC,One of my big issues with my Q10 is that magnifier when correcting something (and the copy/paste function).

It doesn't erase any of your data, but there is a bit of a process to it.  10.3 is significantly different than 10.2  Or just get a Classic, they come with 10.3 haha."
blackberry,38aiid,intrloper,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:57:03 2015 UTC,Sounds like a job for a trackpad.  What are you trying to sync?
blackberry,38aiid,-rogo-,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:36:54 2015 UTC,"People on Crackberry are experiencing double typing on the Classic as well. Not only that, but the Classic has glued the keyboard in so good luck replacing it. It's much easier to replace on the Q10. Also the Q10's removable battery comes in handy if you need that. Classic is non-removable.  I've used the Classic and it feels super premium. It has the best BB keyboard I've ever used, and the tool belt is amazing. I stayed away because of the double typing mess that's going on. Ironically, I'm on the Passport, which might develop double typing... But I just couldn't resist..."
blackberry,38aiid,-rogo-,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:54:33 2015 UTC,I got the classic through tmo and at first had a lot of software complaints but I think that was from being on android for so long now I am in love with it. No double tapping on mine.   Tmo does seem to send out unlocked unbranded versions are well not sure if that makes any difference.   And yeah the toolbelt is great.
blackberry,38aiid,GiangTT,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:36:20 2015 UTC,"I just switched back to a Q10 after a couple months with the Classic. I did it not because I like Q10 better, but I'm also not missing the Classic as much as I thought.   The classic is bigger. I initially stayed away because I thought I'd be too big. Play with one in the store if you haven't already. The Q10 is closer to the 9930 size that I think is still the best blackberry, but the Classic doesn't feel ""too big"" when you're using it. Everything takes up enough room that you can see why it is the size it is.  The Classic is built feeling way more solid. Partially because it's all glued together so it really is almost solid, but also the materials. All around feels very nice.   The keyboard is bigger, and feels amazing, as you would guess, but honestly it was sometimes a little tiring. I think it's because I came from years of the 9700/9900 bolds, and having the smaller keyboard means less travel for my thumbs and I can hammer away faster than a computer keyboard. I'm sure i would have gotten used to it, but that ever-so-slightly larger keyboard was noticeable when I first started using the Classic daily.  The toolbelt is really my favorite part. I'd give up screen space on my Q10 to get that belt. Call start and end keys are so much better to me. Closing running apps by end key > escape key is also much faster than swipe and tap on tiny x. I do have one complaint here though, and that's the toolbelt definitely feels like an add-on. A lot of apps (native, not android) aren't coded to recognize the back button. Even though the trackpad worked on every app I used, the back button almost never did. I'm sure as apps update this will change, but I really only ever used the belt for closing apps, and starting/ending calls. I still used the three dot menu button and touchscreen way more than I thought I would.   TLDR: for $100 upgrading to the Classic is worth it if you really love your Q10/physical keyboard. Buying outright (or used at 300+) it becomes more of ""is it worth it"". If you haven't given thought to the z30 and you can give up a keyboard, I feel that's a no-brainer.   On the other hand, if you don't want to extend your contract, I have an extra Q10 if you want to PM me."
blackberry,38aiid,danieldallas,0,Wed Jun 3 02:51:56 2015 UTC,"Forgot to mention: I didn't have any double-typing in my two months of using it, and I type a lot, so I'm sure it would have come up. If you're buying new (through verizon either discounted or edge or whatever) then you're covered with warranty and I wouldn't worry about it.   People are mentioning it's happening already to them, and even a few threads about the passport. Not sure why blackberry can't figure it out yet, but it seems like a ""could happen to anyone at anytime"" thing. Wouldn't put off getting a Classic based on that alone."
blackberry,38aiid,The_Shivs,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:56:27 2015 UTC,I'm using Bold 9780 and will switch to Q10 as soon as possible. Is the double-typing issue on Q10 can be resolved?

blackberry,38aiid,mcjagga,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:48:00 2015 UTC,I would say go for a Classic.   I turned up my noise at the Classic when it first came out because of its specs. It has the same specs as a Q10 and the Q10 had obsolete specs when it first launch. After handling the Classic a lot while phone shopping I changed my mind. The design of the classic is a big improvement over the Q10. Here are a few things that I felt made the Classic a worthy upgrade.    The bigger screen makes a difference in device usability. Everything from editing docs to reading Web pages is much better on the Classic than the Q10.  The toolbelt is pretty awesome. It's a feature I never missed but find to be very handy. Especially when scrolling through Web pages. Not having your thumb cover a quarter of your screening while scrolling is awesome.  The keyboard is better. It's significantly larger and makes long typing sessions more enjoyable. It also has a nicer feel to it. I find it amazing that blackberry is still improving on their keyboards.    I ended up getting a Passport over a classic when upgraded from the Q10. But I was very temper to buy a classic and think it's a great phone

Snapchat isn't on Amazon and I don't use it so I can't comment on its compatibility from the Google store.  As for switching, AT&T will buy your phone, but if your phone is paid off, you're better selling it yourself on Craigslist or Swappa.  Do not cancel your # on Verizon otherwise you will lose it.  You will need to go to AT&T and start the port process there which will cancel your Verizon line when the port is complete."

blackberry,389r81,Steameffekt,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:31:30 2015 UTC,"Are you using the BlackBerry World version or the Amazon/Google Play version? There might be a difference in how T-Mobile tags the data.   Likewise, the app on a T-Mobile phone with a T-Mobile ROM may have a software pass-through that tags the info there at the gateway as a whitelisted app to not bill the data.   On the BlackBerry or other unlocked phones without T-Mobile ROMs, those gateways would not exist.   I did get the free ""UnRhapsody"" this week after my beloved Grooveshark got canned (RIP my favorite app). I signed up for it on my T-Mobile HTC phone while waiting for my Passport to arrive and it went through this spiel about being a special T-Mobile arrangement and it checks your phone number in T-Mobile's database before texting you a direct link to download it, just to confirm you're actually on T-Mobile.  Anyway, after the Passport arrived, I re-downloaded it, and it works the same as before. The free application is tied to the account creation process there, so it's OS independent.   I don't know if it would count against your data on a BlackBerry because I have the truly unlimited plan, so I have no reason or way to check, but I wanted to highlight a couple of different ways these apps work to hopefully provide some avenues for you to look into for answers."
blackberry,389r81,by_a_pyre_light,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:08:35 2015 UTC,"I'm using the Amazon store version but might switch to the Snap version to see if that makes a difference. Had no idea there was a Blackberry World version, so thank you for pointing that out to me. I'll probably look into unlimited data with T-Mobile if all else fails since I've been with them for years and never bothered to see if my plan's been out dated.   Thanks for the reply."

Been with them for nearly 3 years, short two months I had to switch to AT&T because reception in my apartment didn't exist.   Anyway, the single plans for Unlimited are $80 and include truly unlimited high speed data, text, and calls, plus 5GB of hotspot tethering. Of course, with a Passport, they may not even know how much tethering you're doing since it's not going through their app.   The deal gets even better with two people though - right now it's completely unlimited for two people for $100 - that's only $50 per person. My brother and I split the bill now."

By all means, ignore the free offer and pay for the one you want. It's what I did and many others still do.  They're not bending you over on billing and locking down devices like Verizon does. And if you think Verizon Wireless is somehow not intimately connected to the wireline division you are sorely misguided. What one does is done in consideration of how it affects the other, same with AT&T."

What T-Mobile does is a violation of, amongst other things, network neutrality.   More coverage costs more money. No problem there. Same reason I don't drive a Kia.  My device isn't locked down by Verizon. I'm on unofficial software, since they drag a*s on releasing updates, but that's a different discussion.

The touch sensitive keyboard means you can use swipe motions with predictive text and next-word-suggestions, which might help you out.   I have large hands and the size is no problem. If the 1020 isn't too big for you then I think you'll be fine.

Blackberry (q10) is the best for actually working/travelling imo - battery life, better reception, making calls, writing emails/texts  (I use instagram on my bb as it usually has more batter than the others).  Iphone has the best camera, and I like typing on it a bit more than android, but it feels simplistic, which can be nice in some situations. (I hate itunes too which makes me not want to use it for media, as you can just drag and drop on android and BB)  I find I use Blackberry for most of my communication, and listening to music/audio books, and Android/iphone for most of my video /reading/browsing/app stuff.

My impression is that very few people actually switch from one device eco-system to another.  One thing about BlackBerry, now, especially following 10.3, is that Android apps generally run quite well on this OS (right?). That means that, without looking too closely at your specifications, there really should be any conceivable app's approximate  equivalent available here.   Generally though, I guess you're likely to have a few +'s and -'s, and finally, slowly, an overall impression. BlackBerry is like 'No Nonsense' environment, to me. But I haven't used an apple device since being insulted by an iPod in 2007, which was nonsense."

blackberry,385l9u,by_a_pyre_light,2,Tue Jun 2 13:40:39 2015 UTC,Well - for starters I'm not the best person to ask for advice considering I have both the iPhone six and 6+ and can't decide between them. Basically nothing is ever good enough for me.  With that disclaimer being said:  Generally speaking I feel like the iPhone is a bit of a toy (not as toyish as android). I've been a diehard user since the first generation iPhone - and it baffles me that I have no control over my home screen set up.   It's very annoying to me how there's no way to really just save a pdf or document onto your phone or in your safari browser - you have to store it in some type of cloud or some third-party app. I cloud Drive is a great idea if there was a simple interface to manage and organize documents in your cloud Drive.   My main problem with Apple is that they gave me a Choice with these new phones. I would rather them have chosen either six or 6+ size that way I would be forced to get one or the other and wouldn't second-guess myself  The 6 isn't any bigger than the 5 once you've gotten used to it but the 6 plus is like carrying a tire iron around with you - and it's impossible to hold with no case - it's like a wet baby seal covered in oil.

blackberry,385l9u,brazilian_thunder,0,Tue Jun 2 06:59:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I feel like the Classic is a step down from an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. Those ones pack much better hardware. The chipset in the Classic is now over 3 years old, while the iPhone 6 and Plus are traditionally the most powerful mobile SOCs on the market.   You're going to notice a distinct difference in responsiveness with Android apps on the Classic vs the native apps on your iPhone.   As I've learned with the Passport over the past day, it's really great, but its notification game isn't as strong as Android and Apple's for things like media playing. For instance, with music playing on my Android phone, a lock screen widget was always available to quickly pause, play, skip, etc. the current song. No such thing exists on the BlackBerry.   On Android and iPhone, if you swipe from the top of the screen, current media running will also be there with that same widget. Again, no such widget with the BlackBerry. You have to go to the running app to play/pause music.   On the Passport at least, you can hit the side button (the voice control one) to play/pause music, even on Android apps, so that's a good start. I don't know if other models of BlackBerry phones have this feature.  Now, this may be because I'm using Android's apps for music, but it's not my fault BlackBerry doesn't have them on BlackBerry World, and that Android app access was a big reason for choosing the Passport.   The settings menu is also confusing and overwhelming.   If I had to rank Settings menus in terms of least complex to most complex:   iPhone Android OS/minimal skinning (Motorola, HTC Sense) Samsung's heavy-handed skinning of the Settings menu(s) BlackBerry OS10   Another issue: switching audio sources on a phone call provides a bullet list menu in the top of the screen. Why? It leaves about 80% of the screen a blank white space and it makes it difficult to reach one-handed. They should really redesign that with larger touch-friendly icons. I couldn't find a picture of it online, but if you're really curious, I suppose I could get a screenshot later and post it.  I'm not complaining about the device, but I am noticing that there are many areas where the Passport excels past its rivals and others where it could clearly take a page from their book.   If you're used to having the best hardware available on the simple iOS operating system (is that redundant?), you're going to feel like a fish out of water stepping down to ancient hardware and a far more complex OS. There just isn't a real benefit statement here, especially given your professed proclivity for whimsical apps, which may or may not work well on the Classic."

blackberry,383c5q,ekmeh,7,Mon Jun 1 15:39:36 2015 UTC,I went from a Q10 to a Passport and will never look back. The screen real-estate of the Passport makes doing everything better. And man is the battery insane. I easily get two days of use out of my Passport something I have never had on any other phone.   Now their is the size issue but it's not really an issue. The Passport is much wider than most phones and a little thicker. But BlackBerry didn't just throw this thing together the shape actually works really well ergonomically. While the Passport is wide it's also shorter than a lot of other phones. So it fits nicely in a pocket. The keyboard once you get used to it is the best mobile keyboard I have ever used. Mainly because it's touch functionality means you never have to leave it. And scrolling through long documents is a breeze in landscape mode. This is how a read most things as it let's me use the phone one handed.   Another option you might be considering is a BlackBerry Classic. So let me point out two advantages the Passport has over that phone. The first is the camera. The Passports camera is awesome! It takes amazing pictures and it's 1080p 60fps video recording looks great. The Classics camera isn't bad but it's also not great. So if your camera matters the Passports the way to go.   The second and biggest advantage the Passport has on the Classic is its specs. Now the BlackBerry 10 OS runs pretty amazing on the S4 pro SOC that's in the Classic. Android apps are another story entirely. They open very slow and don't necessarily run smoothly once opened either. The experience is very similar to what you get on a Q10.  On the 801 SOC in the Passport android apps run like they are native. Google's material design also fits in very well with BlackBerry 10 so many of the apps do actually feel native.   Well that's my two cents. I would also like to add that I have an at&t passport

blackberry,37yvyl,Moonrak3r,3,Sun May 31 15:58:25 2015 UTC,"Take the following at your own risk:  The real answer here is it really depends on what version of BES your company is on  in the newest edition (BES12), the IT admin can see w/e application you have installed on the personal side by monitoring the data coming in and out of the device...  In reality, the IT department probably won't fuss over some facebook messages going in and out.  If your company is THAT adamant about regulating the applications on your phone, they can deploy an IT policy to block ""outside sources"" and regulate your app store access.  Lastly, the logs provided to the IT admin automatically truncates all personal information such as passwords, key strokes etc..  So... the TL;DR is:  ""they can investigate into it if they want to. but what they have access to in terms of information is limited. And if there is functionalities in place to that stuff any ways so they would have activated those IT policies if it is THAT big of a security concern."""
blackberry,37yvyl,achow88,2,Sun May 31 16:39:37 2015 UTC,"Your concerns are exactly why there is a personal and corporate space available on BB10. IF, and I do mean IF, your BES admin has things set up correctly you should not be able to share data between the two, meaning you would not be able to copy and paste say an email from corporate to an email in personal space and send it out.  The idea is that the company can control the corporate space and the personal is for you. Now I have seen some policies where the company has supplied the BB and basically does not allow the personal/corporate spaces, they treat the whole device as corporate (like the old BBs). In that case it depends on the usage policies in place.  I think (I would have to double check), a BESAdmin can see what is installed on a BB, corp or personal, but they can not see specific data like email (address and data), contacts or the content of txt messages in the personal space.  Honestly I would ask your IT team or supervisor to clarify the no unauthorized apps policy to you. This could depend on if it is a company owned BB, or BYOD. If it's a company owned BB then they have every right to dictate what gets installed, just like on a laptop or other computer system.

blackberry,37yowh,yaguang,2,Sun May 31 14:59:07 2015 UTC,"There aren't a lot of cases out there for the Z30, so there isn't much to compare with.  I have mixed feelings about it. I got one when I got my Z30 back in January. Initially, I found that I didn't like the way the cover got in the way when I was trying to hold the phone and type. Also, it does not want to stay in the ""closed"" position very much -- it tends to flip open if I set it down on my desk.  I neglected it for a few months, but recently went back to it. The typing issue was mostly worked out by my hands getting used to holding the Z30 (I came from a Bold 9900 so it took some adjustment). It still doesn't stay closed, but I hope that some more breaking in might help. If I want it to stay closed, I will turn it upside down on my desk.  Features that it has:   BlackBerry screen turns off when flip is closed: check Phone can be used with cover closed: check Notification LED can be seen through lens in case: meh, it kind of works but not at all angles Integrated into back of phone to give thinner profile: check Looks nice: check   It does feel and look nice. If it had some physical mechanism to keep it closed, it would be a lot better."
blackberry,37yowh,superbad,2,Sun May 31 15:21:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with all the points here. I used it as my case when I had the Z30. Although, mine was able to keep itself closed. You definitely have to work the leather and it will soften over time."

I believe this sorted itself out over after use but can't remember - maybe I just got used to it...? I had two and had the same issue with both of them, though I've never heard of anyone else having it. Somehow having it on would make the on/off/power button stick occasionally, so I had to be careful each time I pressed that button that I hadn't accidentally turned the phone off."

blackberry,37xx8f,topredditgeek,3,Sun May 31 09:15:01 2015 UTC,"As a Passport user, I tried the Leap full time to see how it would be to go back to a full touchscreen device. Firstly, it felt so nice having something I could wrap my hands around, as opposed to the Passport which always needs to hands.   But if we're comparing it to the Z30, that would depend on the features you use. The Leap does not have NFC, Slimport or USB OTG. If those are things you make use of then you may as well go for the Leap.   Battery life for me was more or less the same as I got with the Z30 - it lasted me the day.   I prefer the way the Leap feels compared to the Z30 but I would personally still choose the Z30 as use USB OTG regularly, if the Leap had it, I would probably go with it.  So, I would say it really depends on the features you'll make use of. The Leap is a pretty good device"
blackberry,37xx8f,djr3yes,4,Sun May 31 12:07:59 2015 UTC,No.  The Z30 and Z10 are both much better choices. I still have no idea why BlackBerry wasted their time with this phone...
blackberry,37xx8f,Ebscer,3,Sun May 31 14:51:43 2015 UTC,"Z30 > Leap > Z10 > Z3  The Leap, based on basic specs, is essentially a Z10 with a bigger battery. As battery life was the Achilles heel of the Z10 I think the Leap is a step up.  I think they're attempting to cleanup and rationalize their product line and manufacturing.  I don't think that's a waste.  The Leap gives them an all touch mid-range phone they can make and sell at a profit.  Unfortunately, at the moment, it leaves current Z30 owners without an upgrade path, and it's confusing to buyers.  The confusion aspect will probably be fixed by discontinuing the Z30 if they haven't done so already.  The upgrade path ... well Z30 owners are just SOL until the next all touch device comes out."

Most stuff works fine although if you are a FB fanatic then you will need to either opt for the Android app from the Amazon appstore/side load or pin a shortcut to the mobile website. Also, Snapchat is an issue, but other than that you should be fine. I don't care for either so it bothers me none.   Passport vs Classic is a common topic these days, but they are world's apart. The PP is a premium phone, everything about it is good quality. The problem for a lot of people is the size of it. The Classic is if you love and miss your old 9900 series. It just takes off where that one left off and the Q10 just didn't satisfy and was quite lackluster. If size is the issue then Classic is for you. Power wise the Classic falls short compared to the PP. Read some reviews and if you can then see if you can find a shop that stocks both so you can at least handle them.   Good luck :)"

Honestly, the Classic seems like a solid option, but the Passport has better hardware and is getting solid, if not glowing, reviews. The Slider phone I linked above seems quite promising, and frankly, it looks good enough that I am hopeful Verizon will pick it up. If those phones look good to you, you might want to wait.

blackberry,37qetp,duane534,1 point,Fri May 29 16:17:19 2015 UTC,"As the article states, companies with larger market share have better relationships with other brands, more products and services supporting your brand, and you enjoy lower production costs.   They can't make a phone for as cheap as an iPhone, which means they would have to charge more than an iPhone to make a profit. You need really good partnerships if you are going to be able to convince people that your brand is worth that value (more than iPhone), but as he mentioned, sales people these days don't know what BlackBerry is."
blackberry,37qetp,theHip,3,Fri May 29 16:27:56 2015 UTC,"As a sales person in that space it's really not at our fault. We do carry BlackBerry in our catalog. I have yet to see their reps give a class on their product. Apple is always having some contest giving out iphones, IPads and giving classes. The apple rep was amazed I had a passport. I had to remind her that BlackBerry has bes for mdm. Also the samsung guy just outright made of of blackberry in front of all the sales reps (this was right before the secusmart tablet came out or I would have chimed in) and he was talking about I think it was their mdm knox.  If there was an opportunity for me to push blackberry, I would. I know it's a better device. Our vp has one, and one of our top reps seen mine and likes it and wants to get one, a cisco guy was facinated by it, and a rep from kasPerski loves BlackBerry but can't use at work because they don't support them (I told her that's the old OS days). But if there was an opportunity, I don't know who to reach out to. Who is my contact? There is nothing.  Let's face it. As a sales person I know cisco is the best when it comes to network equipment. However, working with them is the worst. If it's not a huge deal they can care less. Where is my incentive in pushing their product? I could push HP that does exactly the same thing, smoother process and get more funds to win deals and get more spiffs. Blackberry does none of that or even show up and say ""hey"" were alive! This is what we got and why we are better. Nothing."

blackberry,37nx06,newfor2015,-1,Fri May 29 01:14:56 2015 UTC,WM10's Android solution is the same than BB10's. The only diff is the distribution channel.
blackberry,37nx06,unavailableFrank,1 point,Sat May 30 06:11:10 2015 UTC,No it isn't. On Blackberry you actually run an android app. On windows you are running an app that was originally built for android but recompiled to run on the windows phone os.
blackberry,37nx06,IamRayliotta,1 point,Sat May 30 17:03:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where at you getting this, but check out the Build 2015 Video: Project Astoria.  They clearly explain how to use Android Studio, replace Google Play Services lib with a Microsoft implementation and package the APK inside a XAPP (Like BB uses a BAR with an APK inside) for distribution on the Store.  The Android Runtime on Windows Mobile is just Dalvik VM port(plus posix compatibility and other mumbo jumbo) and for any Android app is just another KitKat phone. They are doing the exact same thing that BB10 is already doing.  Again everything is on the video. There is no such thing as recompilation for Android apps. If anything we won't be able to sideload APKs."
blackberry,37nx06,unavailableFrank,1 point,Sat May 30 20:02:28 2015 UTC,"These apps are being ported to run in the windows runtime. You can also do it with ios apps, which how Microsoft demoed it on candy crush. Windows phones will not run android apps the same way blackberry does. Blackberry runs native apks, windows runs ported apks and ipas"
blackberry,37nx06,IamRayliotta,1 point,Sat May 30 20:44:03 2015 UTC,"None of the Android Apps run on the Windows Runtime, they have their own Android runtime, again, the Build 2015 video explains it all.  iOS is different, they are using Objective-C source code and the Clang compiler to generate a code that runs on top of the MS virtual machine (Common Language Runtime - CLR).  There is no such a thing a ported(o recompiled) APKs or IPAs, APKs runs on their Android Runtime. IPAs cannot be ported or recompiled but the Objective-C code can be reused to create an Universal App."
blackberry,37nx06,unavailableFrank,7,Sat May 30 20:53:29 2015 UTC,BB didn't take the effort or see the need to support it. It's easier to support Android because the OS is open source and most popular iOS apps are available for Android anyway.   BTW - windows won't run an APK or IPA out of the app store. Repackaging is required. BB will run an APK without repackaging. BB has developed fuller android support than windows offers.
blackberry,37nx06,superdirt,5,Fri May 29 01:17:42 2015 UTC,"From what I know, a few simple iOS apps were ported over by the developer to BB10. It's possible. Win10 developers just made it easier to port apps. It still requires the developer to make the port and support it after. So Windows 10 can't run Android and Apple apps, but BlackBerry can run Android apps. We install the APK directly to our phones. Windows 10 users will still have to wait for the developer to get around to porting the app. I'm not saying this is a bad idea. Microsoft has the upper hand over BlackBerry anyway. They have a larger user base and ecosystem."
blackberry,37nx06,eddy_07,3,Fri May 29 01:32:07 2015 UTC,"Microsoft has devoloped a Software Development Kit that allows developers of Android and iOS apps to easily port their apps to a windows 10 machine. While this might sound simple, it is anything but. The bottom line is, Blackberry could probably do the same thing, but developers would have to willingly take time to make their apps runable on Blackberry devices. It's all fine and dandy that Microsoft made an easier way for developers to port their apps over, but unless the developer actually wants to, there won't be apps ported over. If that makes sense. And this is Microsoft we're talking about, a software giant. You'd have a harder time convincing developers to port their apps to Blackberry, even if Blackberry developed an SDK that made it simpler."
blackberry,37nx06,FreemanDave,4,Fri May 29 01:11:40 2015 UTC,"But BlackBerry did did develop SDKs for both android and ios developers to easily port their apps over.

blackberry,37nx06,FreemanDave,3,Fri May 29 02:58:22 2015 UTC,"Android apps can already run directly in BB10 if you have the apk. Windows and ios cannot do that.

blackberry,37nx06,unavailableFrank,1 point,Sat May 30 22:20:03 2015 UTC,"Well Windows Mobile (Smartphones and small Tablets) can run Android apps like Blackberry, in fact they do it in a very similar way(using regular Android apks), from my other post:   Timber (The App used to show the Android runtime on Windows Mobile 10) speaks one language but the Android guy does not understand it, so there is a couple of guys named Dalvik and Art that can translate what Timber says and wants, so Android can understand him and do it.  MS hired one translator (clone it would be a better concept), let's call him Astoria. Astoria is able translate what Timber says to Windows Mobile, so Windows Mobile can do most of the things that Android can in a similar way, but there is a few words and sentences than can't be translated, yet.   For iOS is a whole different story. Devs cannot just run iOS apps, but they can reuse some code (parts) of the app.   You can think about this like one car manufacturer is using the same engine to build two different car models. The only thing in common is the engine but everything else (Look and feel, wheel position, passenger seats, standard or automatic transmission) is different."

blackberry,37hhii,alhths,2,Wed May 27 17:50:03 2015 UTC,Kinda got interested that there was a viable watch out there for my Passport...then I saw it was $250 dollars.  I think I'll be fine with my $15 Casio for now...
blackberry,37hhii,humanmanguy,1 point,Thu May 28 02:21:59 2015 UTC,"The basic Pebble is $99 and the battery lasts over a week.   The Talk2Watch dev is great, and other apps work through Talk2Watch, or in the case of Power Tools directly to the Pebble for some functions (I like knowing when I enter and leave a wifi network, for example, or feel a vibrate when my phone finishes charging).  And there is no longer a need to load the Android app to get the watch faces on... I am pretty excited for my Pebble Time steel to ship in June (or maybe July).   However: It doesn't replace what he Fitbit does. Everyone at work seems to have a Fitbit lately. I am pretty lazy, but I might get one to see if it motivates me a little. :-P"
blackberry,37hhii,Balzac_Onyerchin,1 point,Thu May 28 04:58:12 2015 UTC,"Nice share!   I have been rocking a Fitbit with my Passport for the last few days. It's a nice addition.  The Surge is great because it has a built in GPS. I have only ever brought my PP with me on one run and it wasn't enjoyable. Rather cumbersome. With the Surge, I can easily track my distance!  The Fitbit app acts completely normal and as the same as on my Samsung tablet. Gotta love Snap!  If you are in the market for a activity tracker, I would suggest eyeing up Fitbit. Haven't had any problems yet with my Passport."

blackberry,37jz7p,qsv11427,2,Thu May 28 04:26:45 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to the build quality of the Classic but if you're running into the same problems with multiple devices it might be something you're doing.  Are you running any/many Android apps? Have you tried running the phone as close to stock/factory reset as possible to see if the problems still persist? Is there anything going on in the device monitor when these episodes occur? If I had to guess I'd suspect that it might be some android app/background service that's causing havoc.    I've had my Q10 for nearly 2 years and a Z30 for around a year and I can count the number of times I've had glitches and needed to reboot on a single hand... BB10 has be quite reliable from my perspective, but I don't use all that many apps."
blackberry,37jz7p,pbeaul,3,Thu May 28 05:54:16 2015 UTC,"I agree. Usually performance/behavior problems are attributed to poor quality apps.  Here are some tips that usually resolve any cellphone performance issues: •Restart the device daily, such as when you charge the phone •Remove any apps you haven't used in a couple weeks (remember the app store tracks those that were uninstalled) •One by one, remove apps to see if the problems stop. Replace when you remove the next one. Unless you're willing to remove all 3rd party apps then reinstall until the problems reoccur •Remove additional email accounts no longer used •Disable device encryption if enabled •Transfer as much data as possible to the microSD card •Back up the entire phone to your computer. This process will also assist in identifying any corrupt files which can easily create abnormal phone behavior •Disable bluetooth, hotspot, tethering, and the GPS/location services. Keep them powered only when necessary  I bet you will come up with more ideas after reading this list. Good luck!"
blackberry,37jz7p,MacheteSanta,2,Thu May 28 08:26:16 2015 UTC,"I had a restarting issue today. When I got my Passport stable, I opened the CPU monitor to watch what processes were coming up. I noticed Spotify kept going active for no reason.  I deleted it.  Then, the Amazon App Store kept going active. I couldn't delete it, but I closed it. Things have been stable since. I won't feel safe till a few days have gone by, but hopefully my solution will assist you."

But based on her usage description I would get the phone that she likes the look of better. The amoled screen on the z30 is also quite poor compared to most smartphones.  If she is a heavy user of the speakerphone then you'll want to lean toward the z30 too."
blackberry,37gya8,dannomite,2,Wed May 27 17:03:06 2015 UTC,"The Z30 is higher in specs however it sounds like she's not a heavy user so the Leap may be perfect for her. I've used both and actually prefer the way the Leap feels in the hand but would like the Z30 specs. I'm a heavy user though, so I need more power.  You mentioned she's lives in an area with low signal, the Z30 has a Paratek antenna to help make signal stronger so that may be a point for the Z30."
blackberry,37gya8,djr3yes,2,Wed May 27 17:17:13 2015 UTC,does the leap feel cheap in hand? and is there enough grip that you can use without a case?
blackberry,37gya8,dannomite,2,Wed May 27 17:29:21 2015 UTC,Definitely does not feel cheap in the hands. And yes enough grip without a case
blackberry,37gya8,djr3yes,2,Wed May 27 18:48:10 2015 UTC,"I'm actually in the same boat myself. My carrier gives lower rates for off-contract customers, and BlackBerrys are super cheap from BBRY directly.   In what way is the Z30 higher in specs?  And, I thought all BBs after the Z10 had Paratek. Does the Leap not?"
blackberry,37gya8,duane534,3,Wed May 27 18:32:15 2015 UTC,"In what way is the Z30 higher in specs?    The CPU is faster (Dual core 1.7Ghz vs 1.5Ghz) The Z30 is a penta band (vs quad), and I believe it has a better antenna setup. Has more sensors (gyro, altimeter, compass, etc) Dedicated mini HDMI port It's cheaper...   Aside from that, I believe most other specs are very similar."
blackberry,37gya8,pbeaul,3,Wed May 27 18:55:45 2015 UTC,Z30 has - Faster CPU - USB OTG - NFC - Better speakers
blackberry,37gya8,djr3yes,2,Wed May 27 19:19:08 2015 UTC,"If she doesn't use it for anything other than the messages, I think the main things you need to look at are the size (the Z30 can be unwieldly for some) and maybe screen type (the Z30 is probably dimmer).  From another thread, there is a Groupon for the Q10/Z30 if money is an issue. Just make sure you get the correct version for your network (I think the Groupon is States only though.)"

blackberry,37a2et,loserlame,0,Thu May 28 01:12:39 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the BlackBerry recalls the last IP address it was assigned, and it has been assigned a new one by the router. Or, since wireless routers have the channel set to ""Auto,"" it has switched to one that the BlackBerry doesn't support (no device supports all channels).  Rebooting the phone, and then maybe the router, should resolve this.  If rebooting the devices doesn't help, you should reset your router and reprogram the network. Unless you are comfortable with troubleshooting the router settings  If you do the latter, change the WiFi channel to a static value instead of ""Auto"". Best to start with channel 6 on the 2.4GHz band. Lower numbers increase range but also increase latency ""ping."""
blackberry,377egl,FightingLight,4,Mon May 25 14:17:20 2015 UTC,I do believe the folder icon indicates a subfolder of your account is being displayed in addition to your inbox.  If you tap the account name header it will display a list of all the subfolders in that account.  Depending on the folder hierarchy you will see a bunch of folders that are top level and also some that have plus signs next to them indicating they can be expanded to display folders beneath them.  Look for folders that are green with the sync arrows overlaid.  Messages in those folders would also be displayed.

Western engineering is costly, but you get what you pay for with a higher quality and reliability of final product. A development and engineering company you need all the overhead for prototyping and support staff and operators and test equipment. With devices and their refresh rate of 9 to 12 months, final product quality and durability no longer matters, so the emphasis becomes more cost driven. This is why aircraft manufacturing and design is almost exclusively done in the west as opposed to small electronic devices."

blackberry,372qq6,Pesiah,4,Mon May 25 00:23:17 2015 UTC,Blackberry has stayed loyal to the keyboard since the dawn of time. I don't think Android would change that.
blackberry,372qq6,Pesiah,12,Sun May 24 11:31:15 2015 UTC,"Even if it was that easy, to just have another OS installed within a BB device-- even if this could work to Blackberry's advantage, there is no way non-BB users would be interested in this deal. I think a lot of people prefer to be seen as a certain type of consumer: they like to be seen with their choice of brand because it says something about them. For this reason, people wouldn't want to be perceived as ""outdated"", and have to explain ""oh yeah its a BB on the outside but the OS is apple/android/windows/etc, I'm REALLY an apple/android/windows fan"".  There would really be no incentive for other people to pick up a blackberry, just to use another OS within.   Moreover, there would be no real reason for BB-fans to bite either. If you want another OS, most other current devices have stronger processors, more storage, and more capability. Most notably, blackberry's cameras are much weaker than most other phones on market. Not to mention, removing BB OS removes the vast majority of benefits of owning a BB (security, the hub, smart emailing, etc). Aside from having perhaps a keyboard (with BB models aside from Z-line BBs), you'd be left with a vastly inferior product.  Tldr: it definitely wouldn't generate more BB users; no incentive for non-BB users to do this; virtually only disincentive for BB users to do this."
blackberry,372qq6,ATerranosaur,2,Sun May 24 11:43:19 2015 UTC,"They could still market it as a work phone. No matter what era we are talking about BB has always made exceptionally work in the innovation department.  That would be the point, taking the same customer base that uses Blackberries for their work and giving them an option to use Android. This not only gives BB a chance to attract new customers with the credibility that Android brings to the table, it also gives current BB users even more of a reason to stick to BB OS. Android in my opinion sucks (currently own a S5), but it is what people are comfortable with.    Blackberry would be much more equip to tackle the competition of a competitive Android market with totally fresh ideas and more money to put into development. Imagine a passport with Android. I think it would work and work great. People will get sick of chocolate bar phones sooner or later.   What do you think would be BBs best chance of getting new users?"
blackberry,372qq6,luv2hotdog,3,Sun May 24 11:59:29 2015 UTC,"The thing that makes blackberry a successful business mobile is the operating system, though. Removing the operating system, you remove all of the security and functionality* of the device. (*=in the sense of BB-functionality/business-functionality)   I'm definitely no expert on the subject, but I think that BB is doing good work by getting celebrity testimonials of why they stick with (or switched to) BB. On their twitter, they have been tweeting these testimonials from professional photographers, politicians, military, musicians, etc. Unfortunately, this method of advertising only works if BB users retweet (as non-BB users are unlikely to hear about this news otherwise). I don't have other social media so I'm not sure how they're doing on other platforms.   BB has previously offered deals to ""buy out contracts"" for those who have impulsively wanted to make the switch to BB (I'm not sure if this is over now, but this incentive definitely sparked a lot of new interest for the brand by bringing back old users and bringing in new users.   I'm not sure what's going on in the rest of canada right now, but in MB at least, samsung is somehow choking BB out of the business market. I know several provincial businesses that have left BB in 2015 for samsung. This cost them thousands of users. The reason cited is usually that app-devs who work for the businesses are creating mandatory business apps but they are only familiar with android/apple appstores. I know that we can get android apps but the process is obviously a lot smoother on the native android devices. BB needs to reach out to businesses (ideally before they leave) and outsource BB-devs to create/translate the apps to make them natively available in BB world."

BB has not handled their fall very well. The passports design intrigued me so much that I have one coming in the mail as we speak. Although, I never thought about going back to blackberry until my mobile experience became so counter productive, I feel like BB needs to find a way to touch on the massive Android market a bit more to keep themselves afloat."
blackberry,372qq6,by_a_pyre_light,-1,Sun May 24 12:25:53 2015 UTC,"Touchscreen only phones are for people who like to use instagram stuff like that.  BB is for people who like to get shit done that actually matters, with their phone."
blackberry,372qq6,SuppA-SnipA,5,Sun May 24 13:21:36 2015 UTC,this doesn't take into account the all-touch blackberries though - the z30 was a great phone and just as productive as one of blackberry's keyboard phones
blackberry,372qq6,Pesiah,3,Sun May 24 15:00:26 2015 UTC,"Possibly, but do you feel like BB is ONLY for people who get shit done?"
blackberry,372qq6,tomjenzen,-2,Sun May 24 13:33:40 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, there isn't enough support for other things to really do much fucking the dog on a blackberry. And when you can, it sucks."
blackberry,372qq6,KneebarKing,2,Sun May 24 13:41:03 2015 UTC,That is more of an OS functionality problem rather than the device itself.
blackberry,372qq6,lrph00,3,Sun May 24 13:42:59 2015 UTC,"No, it's not an OS functionality issue. He's saying there's not enough 3rd party developer support out there to make it the ""fun"" OS like Android and iOS are. The lack of developer interest in creating games and time wasters is what he's talking about."
blackberry,372qq6,KneebarKing,2,Sun May 24 21:19:24 2015 UTC,"That essentially what I was saying. BB OS has a lack of functionality in the ""fun"" department."
blackberry,372qq6,KneebarKing,2,Mon May 25 07:53:51 2015 UTC,Ahem - Z10? Z30? Your comment is a bit contradicting.
blackberry,372qq6,andrelegare,3,Sun May 24 16:17:48 2015 UTC,"(editing my comment is unavailable in RedditInMotion)  I forgot to mention in my post, BB needs much better customer service. They're notorious for the trouble they give their clients, and that is not good for businesses (or individual users, but especially businesses, who would rather have something that 'just works' or offers full refunds for faulty products). Obviously BB does not have the money to be refunding frivolously, but they should definitely be more apologetic for their shortcomings (i.e. offer store credit if unable to flat out refund products, don't ignore legitimate customer complaints)."
blackberry,372qq6,MiraiSeikatsu,8,Sun May 24 12:31:54 2015 UTC,"The reason I'm using Blackberry is because it isn't an Android. I got tired of a laggy, spyware-prone OS that I had to factory reset every other month. I've used my Z30 for close to two years now, and it rocks as it did on Day 1. I have never made that claim about any of the 4 Android devices I've used.  I'm thrilled Blackberry is what it is, because I really don't want to go back to an iPhone either!"
blackberry,372qq6,MiraiSeikatsu,9,Sun May 24 15:15:58 2015 UTC,"The single reason that they will not adopt Android or any other OS is security of the device. Android specifically is the least secure OS on the market and BlackBerry has always been known for having the most secure devices on the market. It's totally counter-intuitive to adopt anything that won't guarantee, or at least have the highest measures of mobile security on the market. This is why the highest levels of god and military use BlackBerry instead of iOS or Android.  They would lose far more important customers than they would gain on a deal like that. You don't sacrifice your largest selling point so a few fickle consumers will buy your hardware."
blackberry,372qq6,luv2hotdog,2,Sun May 24 15:34:21 2015 UTC,"Good answer. Id have to combat that with saying not everyone in the cell phone market is looking for a secure device. Secure devices are what CURRENT BB users are buying them for, but most likely not what everyone else is. That is why I said to make it optional, to give the secure device seekers what they want and what the general public what they want. This is all of course, hypothetical. Just an idea that could allow BB to put themselves back into the smartphone picture."
blackberry,372qq6,akiva23,3,Sun May 24 15:39:18 2015 UTC,"Let's say they do make it an option.  The first time that a android loaded blackberry gets compromised they news will have a field day. The headline won't read ""android loaded blackberry hacked"". It will read ""blackberry gets hacked"" or ""blackberry no longer most secure"".   I respect your opinion. Just a terrible idea.  As far as blackberry putting themselves back in the picture. They already are. Slowly. I don't see as many hit articles as I used to. There is no doubt that when people see my phone they know it's a nice phone."
blackberry,372qq6,superdirt,2,Sun May 24 21:48:29 2015 UTC,"I know what you're saying, but what kind of returns will BlackBerry get from putting out a device in an already hugely diluted Android market? Their hardware business is easily the weakest division in the company, and I don't think developing a phone that is counter to what they're known for will sway anyone.   The only thing close to what you're suggesting that would ever happen is BlackBerry further integrating with Android. If BlackBerry put out an official Google Play Store and managed to get Play Services, then there is something to sell to the public... Android app ecosystem on a secure platform. People care about apps first and the OS second, I think. So to this end, you can get your social media types satisfied with the same device that satisfies power users.   It's terribly poor business to adopt an unsecure OS if your company is renowned for its security. The only real way to go is integrate the apps so that you can have everything Android offers in the BlackBerry OS."
blackberry,372qq6,brandonto,2,Sun May 24 22:15:48 2015 UTC,"What you are saying is a much better way of touching on that market. The only thing I would be skeptical of is, wouldn't bringing on an app store full of insecure apps be very similar to bringing on an insecure OS?"
blackberry,372qq6,SovietShooter,3,Mon May 25 07:52:08 2015 UTC,"My technical prowess on the security of apps versus the OS is very limited, however I feel like an unsecure OS has more destructive potential than any app. App security is tough, but I think BlackBerry Guardian has a big role to play with that.   All this being said, this is likely why BlackBerry hasn't done more to integrate the Android catalog onto their BlackBerry devices. Security is the one thing aside from a keyboard that BlackBerry does better than anyone else. It would absolutely tarnish their last asset in the public eye if some uninformed reporter said that BlackBerry devices are hackable now. BlackBerry has been getting dogged for years because of incredible bias towards iOS and Android (see BGR), and they have to shut down the naysayers anytime they have news that's positive. BlackBerry made a mountain of mistakes leading up to BlackBerry 10, but the media had, and continue to have, what seems like selective memory or just a plain old vendetta against BlackBerry. BlackBerry can't catch a break, even when they do great things."
blackberry,372qq6,WolfangAukang,1 point,Mon May 25 14:22:48 2015 UTC,"No, since all Android apps run in a sort of virtual machine (Android Player runtime), they do not affect the core BB10 operating system. It's sort of like how one can run Windows software in a virtual machine on a Mac. If there's malware, you just reset the VM and move on. On the Android runtime, malware can't spread out and affect the BB10 system, where all the secure communications features reside. Notice how Android apps on BB10 can't access your text messages or read files you have stored outside specific folders. It's all contained. In my opinion, BlackBerry can include a store full of Android malware and it won't affect BB10 at all. P.S. Just like how there is a speed hit when running, say, Internet Explorer in a VM, Android apps will run more slowly on BB10 than on a native device. In the larger context of security, it's a fair tradeoff."
blackberry,372qq6,WolfangAukang,7,Fri May 29 17:16:38 2015 UTC,"It really wouldn't make any financial sense to do that. The phones themselves are no more attractive to consumers than those Samsung or HTC have to offer, and shifting focus to promote phones in such a competitive market seems like giving up on an already difficult  battle to fight an even harder one. Keyboards are really the only competitive advantage they have but they're a niche feature clearly.  Also, it's unlikely that people would shift to an optional OS if a well-known alternative is available. And keeping resources devoted to an OS whose user numbers only decline would be a very poor strategy.  Plus, BlackBerry have repeatedly said in the recent past that they need to expand their software business - they still feel that they have something to say in the phone market and I think the Passport shows that specifically, but if they're going to cut on something it will more likely be hardware rather than software."
blackberry,372qq6,sacrilegious,2,Sun May 24 11:51:15 2015 UTC,"That is an interesting perspective. Personally, Blackberry never ceases to catch my eye with their design. The point would be simply to just use Android as a marketing tool to give BB a way to sell more phones. This is all hypothetical of course."
blackberry,372qq6,countpuchi,3,Sun May 24 12:03:11 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but I think most people would not be in the same boat.  In terms of design, even though I loved the Z30, I have to say that the iPhone 6 and the Samsung S6 are quite the eye-catchers, more so than anything BlackBerry ever made.  I like that my Passport is unique and people look at it and ask questions, but what I really like about my BB devices (own a Z10 and a Passport) is the OS - cannot live without the Hub, Remember and now my superb keyboard."
blackberry,372qq6,9vDzLB0vIlHK,3,Sun May 24 14:25:58 2015 UTC,"I think blackberry is really on to something with the passport though. Chocolate bar phones have been around for much too long. When something like the S6 comes out with rounded egdes and what not, I get really excited until I actually purchase the phone then figure out that it is the same old same old. Although I dont have a passport yet I feel like the design is gonna add an element to the experience rather than just notifications on the edge of my smartphone. That's what I want and I feel other people would enjoy that if Blackberry could reach out to that market."
blackberry,372qq6,garcia85,3,Sun May 24 14:33:51 2015 UTC,"Regardless of form factor, I've always been impressed with the build quality of every blackberry phone I've had. They don't always look amazing like the iphones do but they've all had a great in-hand feel.  Good in-hand-feel is harder to advertise than a great looking design but it's there :)"
blackberry,372qq6,andrelegare,2,Sun May 24 15:02:59 2015 UTC,"I cant agree with you on the iphone design. I feel like they have been selling the same exact design for 10 years now. All they do is switch up the material and screen size and people buy it. But the thing is, it  has become normal because every company has their own look. With Blackberry, they switch the whole look pretty often."

blackberry,371h91,cjENTusBLAZE,2,Sat May 23 23:57:30 2015 UTC,It does not work with any device at this time. There is an issue with the app/android-runtime that prevents the app from allowing users to login. It would otherwise play very well on the z30. The small screen may be an issue on the Classic though.

blackberry,36y4p1,dmcnelly,1 point,Sat May 23 17:36:15 2015 UTC,"I just switched over from the iPhone 6 to the Blackberry Classic, and so far I'm enjoying it quite a bit. Most of my niggles about it are simply transitional pains (navagation, menu differences, app differences) but I'm yet to run into anything that's a dealbreaker.  Pros:   BlackBerry Blend works beautifully. Don't even miss iMessage. (That was my biggest concern) The interface is smooth and responsive. LTE reception is improved a decent amount. Obviously the keyboard feels fantastic. The overall build quality of this device is hands down the nicest I've ever felt in a handset. Better than the iPhone.   Cons:   Getting SNAP! on the phone can be a bit tricky for a novice user, and SNAP! makes this phone infinitely more competitive. The trackpad is slightly crooked. (This only bothers me from an aesthetic standpoint. It works fine.) The trackpad highlights EVERYTHING when you're scrolling. (Again, an aesthetic issue.) Some of the menus and behaviors of the OS seem counterintuitive. I can't get Facebook messages and standard notifications to separate in the hub. I just want to see FB messages, not all my notifications. There's no good way to dismiss these notifications from the hub other than deleting each one. A simple ""swipe to the right/left"" would be fantastic.    Coming from the Apple ecosystem, I have to admit some things I just expect to work in a certain way. That's not the case with BlackBerry. There are things that require workarounds to make happen.   The good news however, is there aren't many of these things. In fact, that number is so small, I don't recall what I've had to do a workaround for, other than installing SNAP!.   As someone who isn't a huge mobile gamer, but instead spend much of my time writing on my phone, this thing is a godsend. It's wonderful. It's a messaging powerhouse and the Hub makes life so much easier."

I work in live production so I need to have extremely high quality files.    Sure, if you're editing audio you want it lossless, but for listening there is no reason for that at all. iTunes match uses 256kbps AAC which should be completely transparent.   If you're looking for high-quality audio, then Apple should be at the top of your list. Here is the frequency response graph for an iPhone 6, compare that to the OnePlus One. And here is the BB Z10 for reference.   Why are you wasting your time with lossless if you have a shitty DAC ?   If you want quality, you have to pay for it. If you want an Android phone with similar audio quality as an iPhone you're looking at the exact same price range.   Also, there are many apps for iOS for live music production, there aren't any for Android because Android is fundamentally unable to do low-latency audio.    Also, paying for a plan with data that can stream my music will be upwards of $100 a month (assuming I don’t go over my data limit).   Dude, you don't need tens of gigabytes to stream a little audio. Wifi is everywhere and 4G will be there to take over in the few instances you can't get wifi. It's a complete non-issue.   I want to stay away from as much data usage as possible.

blackberry,36ubai,KidUnidentifiable,3,Fri May 22 04:30:50 2015 UTC,"I don't have a Leap, but I do have a Q10 and Z30...    The BB10 OS is actually quite fluid and smooth only time I encounter any reasonably perceptible ""lag"" is when I'm using android apps. Multi-tasking/jumping in/out of apps on BB10 is WAY better than any other mobile OS (by a really large margin) Generally if a BB version exists yes, if it's an android app I believe it's hit or miss. WeChat appears to have a blackberry app so it should be fine. Q10 is my daily driver (and my Z30 is almost always better battery wise) and I've done 60 - 90 minutes of GPS and I believe it will drain somewhere in the 15 - 25% range. The quality of the GPS app isn't as full featured as google maps but for car navigation purposes it does a good job. My 2 year old Q10 (original battery) lasts me 36 hours and I have 5 emails (2 push, 2 fetching every 30 minutes, 1 every 4 hours) generally do an 30 - 45 minutes of talking a day and a decent amount of emailing/texting. My Z30 will last more than 2 days... Leap will have no problem handling a full day. Blackberries are generally very serviceable, take a few screws out and you can generally access what you need. There is pretty much zero bloat on my phone... There's a few BB10 setup/tutorials/help ""apps"" but I wouldn't consider that bloat. I suspect this could be different based on your carrier. Never had a hardware issue, and never tried reporting a bug... If you like messing around with your phone you can generally find leaked /upcoming versions of the OS that are very simple to install and usually work great (stay away from the bleeding edge beta stuff). This is great because you can upgrade your own phone and not have to wait 2 years for a carrier OTA update. BB10 OS is in my opinion the best mobile OS (I have Android/Windows/iOS devices), it runs very well on less than stellar hardware, in fact both the Classic and the Leap share very similar specs to the phones released 2+ years ago which should mean they'll be plenty of support for the old phones.  In my opinion, the only major problem left to solve for BB10 is the app ecosystem, and it's a hugely complicated and hard thing to solve. The current android band-aid is a decent solution for now but as the android vs BB performance gap widens and android apps keep expecting more and more CPU it will make the experience worse and worse for BB10 devices. As it stands, I'm satisfied with the performance of my Q10 for anything blackberry, only time I wish I had a better CPU is when I run android apps as some of them start/run slower than I care for. I read PDFs frequently and the odd document and it works fine... These devices have higher PPI than most monitors. The whole PPI race that's been going on for the past few years is silly and nothing more than an exercise in futility. 1080p was good enough for 60"" tvs now they're cramming 4x as many pixels into 5"" screens... All it does is require more computational power/battery. Don't have a leap so I'll skip this...   Wow, that's a lot of text... Hope it helps."

blackberry,36ubai,oaknutjohn,2,Sun May 24 21:17:22 2015 UTC,"I have the Z10 so I can only answer questions about BB10 generally. Hopefully that still helps.   Third party apps can get hub integration, but sometimes just have notifications and not their own dedication slot in the hub. I use Waze and it sucks for my battery, the stock GPS is better for battery saving but can't hold a candle to Waze. In general, I average about 9 hours without a charge, not sure how the Leap will do though. I'd say the integration between hardware / software is very good. I've had this phone since 2013 I believe, and even when it was new people knocked it's specs but it's still able to keep up with new phones. The only lag I get is with specific apps, 95% are android but also reddit in motion and the search app sometimes. No bloat ware issues, but I run OS leaks usually. PDF and other docs is where BlackBerry excels, but again, I have a z10."

It makes other os's look clunky and not very organic to use. I was a long time Android user right from the HTC legend to the LG g3 and they all suffer from the same problems. Lag, lag and more lag. As another comment says as Android keeps upping specs, app developers keep making their apps use more CPU power. It's a vicious circle and one I've gladly left behind. I also have an iPhone 5s and find both phones dual core processors more than adequate to give a smooth and lag free experience. I've also had a windows phone with the Lumia 820 and even that was smooth and lag free."

blackberry,36hndz,oratorioo,3,Wed May 20 06:59:36 2015 UTC,"Can I ask if you use any android apps on your phone? I have many contacts over a wide range of chatting apps ( Line, Viber, skype, whatsapp, etc). I had the Blackberry Q5 and loved it for it's battery life and multitasking but android apps such as Line loads slowly and have a weird notification. Currently using a LG G3, it's great but I miss blackberry OS 10."
blackberry,36hndz,nottychz,4,Tue May 19 15:36:45 2015 UTC,Whatsapp works really well and integrates into the blackberry hub perfectly. Not used any of the others though.
blackberry,36hndz,oratorioo,2,Tue May 19 15:39:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the quick reply. Yeah Whatsapp works great and the phone call using whatsapp makes it better. I'll try rebooting my Q5 again. Feel like selling my G3 for a passport but if those few android apps can't work smoothly for me, it will be a big problem."
blackberry,36hndz,nottychz,2,Tue May 19 15:51:56 2015 UTC,"As far as android apps go, 99% have worked perfectly for me.   The only ones that don't are the ones that require a Google account login. There are obviously a few exceptions but that's how it tends to work for the most part."
blackberry,36hndz,oratorioo,2,Tue May 19 16:00:15 2015 UTC,"It's true that most of my experience with Android apps are that they do work. What I hope the Snapdragon 801 on the passport does is to speed up the loading. Lots of apps especially line take quite some time to load on the Q5. Besides that and some minor inconveniences, I'm happy with blackberry."
blackberry,36hndz,oratorioo,3,Tue May 19 17:52:43 2015 UTC,As said already most Google apps work perfectly. I don't use a whole host of third party apps. My main communication tool between myself and my employees is email or BBM as all my employees use blackberry. I have Skype but haven't used it as of yet. Fiancé has whatsapp and works perfectly and integrates into the hub as mentioned.
blackberry,36hndz,kanuk101,2,Tue May 19 16:14:28 2015 UTC,I see. Well I'll try to pick up a second hand passport and see how it goes. Thanks for the replies.
blackberry,36hndz,dimex,3,Tue May 19 17:50:32 2015 UTC,"I think your review just might be what it took to get me onto the Passport bandwagon. The one thing I would enjoy is better access to excel, and it appears the Passport could be the phone for that.   Thanks for taking the time to write this up."
blackberry,36hndz,dimex,2,Tue May 19 17:37:54 2015 UTC,"It's brilliant at editing excel documents. I have my stuff saved on dropbox and it syncs perfectly through there. Real easy to work with. Glad I got you onto the bandwagon, it's an enjoyable productive ride on here."
blackberry,36hndz,kanuk101,2,Tue May 19 17:56:38 2015 UTC,"If you have business PCs, setup WoL or keep them running 24/7.   Remote in using your Passport using your Remote Desktop client of choice. You can then use the Passport as a full on. PC, and run full Excel."
blackberry,36hndz,jazda83,2,Tue May 19 18:10:21 2015 UTC,How does a desktop screen look on a passport? Also what's WoL? I know there is a teamviewer app is this similar?
blackberry,36hndz,seansolo2k,2,Tue May 19 18:14:39 2015 UTC,"Desktop screen looks great on the Passport. With a wireless keyboard and mouse, it really could replace carrying around a laptop or hybrid by using remote desktop.  WoL = Wake on Lan, turning on your computer remotely  TeamViewer does work very well with the Passport. Wish they would incorporate scrolling and input using the keyboard, but they dont. There's no 1440 resolution, so it will be 1920x1080 but you can zoom in and out just fine."

When you enable Web Inspector, it gives you an IP address and if you put that in desktop web browser it gives you a list of every page open in the Blackberry Browser and lets you debug remotely."
blackberry,36ia7l,CyberneticAngel,3,Tue May 19 16:20:44 2015 UTC,I hear that with the new update 10.3 they should be more compatible. What bb10 version do you have?
blackberry,36ia7l,3SGTO,1 point,Tue May 19 17:29:46 2015 UTC,10.2.1.3014  So the general consensus is that I need to go ahead and push the update to 10.3?

blackberry,36ia7l,ThaCarterr,2,Tue May 19 18:57:49 2015 UTC,I've found that using whatsapp integrates emojis on any platform. So if you and your wife don't mind using whatsapp then that is an alternative.
blackberry,36ia7l,MoopusMaximus,2,Tue May 19 17:36:21 2015 UTC,"10.3.1 you can see them, as they incorporated Google's Android emojis."

blackberry,36gh6z,brkdncr,2,Tue May 19 05:34:45 2015 UTC,I've missed pretty much everything
blackberry,36gh6z,moni11811,2,Tue May 19 05:47:59 2015 UTC,"Don't expect it to act anything remotely like the 8700. The OS is a complete revamp, not just an update like OS6 to OS7"
blackberry,36gh6z,WiFiForeheadWrinkles,1 point,Tue May 19 06:32:53 2015 UTC,"That's pretty exciting, honestly. I love trying out new mobile OSes, and it sounds like even though adding Android apps is a bit of work, this new OS is leaps and bounds above and beyond the old BBOS."
blackberry,36gh6z,intrloper,2,Tue May 19 06:50:21 2015 UTC,I got a classic on friday and so far I really want to return it.  The physical device feels great but the software is a let down honestly.  I am trying my best to see the good but so far doing even the simplest tasks seem to be so backwards.
blackberry,36gh6z,intrloper,1 point,Tue May 19 06:11:28 2015 UTC,"I saw from your posts you've been having quite a bit of issues with it, but it looks like they're mostly email related. Is that the case?"
blackberry,36gh6z,intrloper,2,Tue May 19 06:48:23 2015 UTC,"Well was trying to get FastMail to work right but I think that was more  FastMail then BB. Got an outlook.com account which I actually like so far.  The issues I have now are thinks like:  Tonight when i left work i needed to get the number for ""Walgreens on Dixie"" and the assistant returned every store on the highway. It was a farse. (Note: just tried same search with google and got instant results)  I wont lie Google search and products are very nice and advanced but I really wanted to move away from them mainly because they want to bind you to crap like G+ which I dont/wont use. Dont like them being able to target ads to contacts, etc.  Another thing I dont like much is that the app world is pretty bad, in the sense even the good apps seem to be far behind google and the comment section is full of people complaining about them.  It is hard to look at BB as a leader in anything anymore when even simple things seem hard to accomplish.  I plan on using the phone for least 10 days before I decide to return it. I will 100% honest, I want very badly to love this platform and keep it but I just dont know right now. There are still a handful of things I need to correct before I could feel comfortable with ditching google completely."
blackberry,36gh6z,22justin,2,Tue May 19 07:02:08 2015 UTC,"Tonight when i left work i needed to get the number for ""Walgreens on Dixie"" and the assistant returned every store on the highway. It was a farse. (Note: just tried same search with google and got instant results)   Man, I can't get one of those stupid things to work right for me on ANY phone I've owned. Siri has been particularly bad for anything other than ""Play this song"" or ""What's the forecast"" in my experience. I'll say ""Nearest Meijer location"" and it'll tell me ""Here's one!"" and it's one 20 miles away even if I'm sitting in the Meijer parking lot. Google's search always seems to be a bit more reliable.   I wont lie Google search and products are very nice and advanced but I really wanted to move away from them mainly because they want to bind you to crap like G+ which I dont/wont use. Dont like them being able to target ads to contacts, etc.   I definitely know the feeling there. Gmail is the only service of theirs I use, and it's always worked really well for me. I know they're kinda evil, but that's something I've learned to live with. I definitely sympathize there though. Moving away from the big green monster is kinda hard if you've been with them long enough.   Another thing I dont like much is that the app world is pretty bad, in the sense even the good apps seem to be far behind google and the comment section is full of people complaining about them.   That's a concern of mine as well. I'm not a real heavy app user, but there are a few that I'm not sure I'm going to find once I switch over.   It is hard to look at BB as a leader in anything anymore when even simple things seem hard to accomplish.   I think they're trying to find their footing again, and it's admirable, but we're going to have to suffer through the growing pains. It's almost like you have to completely forget everything you know about BlackBerry and look at them as the feisty upstart giving it a fair shake. It may blossom, it may wither. I mean, look at Symbain a few years back. Nokia wanted that to just blow up big, and it just blew up in their face. I think the BB brand is more valuable than Nokia's smartphone line ever was, so it does have at least a little better chance.   I plan on using the phone for least 10 days before I decide to return it. I will 100% honest, I want very badly to love this platform and keep it but I just dont know right now. There are still a handful of things I need to correct before I could feel comfortable with ditching google completely.   I think that's really what it comes down to is getting used to starting over. It's like learning to drive a right-hand-drive car. All the basics are there, but you're still trying to get used to staying in your lane and shifting gears with your left hand.   The things you're describing remind me a lot of when the G1 came out. It was rough in the 1.x days. It wasn't bad, it wasn't great, but it was full of potential and if you gave yourself a chance to learn it, it was pretty cool. I think it really does come down to approaching it as a completely different world and a completely different ecosystem. Google is hard to escape but I feel like the challenge is part of the fun of it.   That's why I want to ditch my iPhone. It does everything I want it to do very well, but it's not fun anymore. It's like riding the same roller coaster over and over again. You know all the drops and turns and banks, and it does still get the adrenaline pumping, but there's no adventure to it.   That being said, the honesty is refreshing. All I read are either ""this thing is terrible"" or ""this is the greatest phone ever""."
blackberry,36gh6z,akiva23,2,Tue May 19 08:18:00 2015 UTC,"the OS on any device isnt really what is selling me at this point it is the security and privacy that I want, however a physical keyboard does appeal to me a lot as well.  Personally if Google offered a paid way to remove all ads, G+, unrestricted commenting without said G+ crap and didnt do crap like send out emails to contact list then I would be super happy to stay with them.  It is bothersome to think that Google is so big and we are so invested in them that if we wanted to move away it becomes almost impossible to replace the apps/services.  I am getting to the point that any company with that much control over your personal info is scary.  Honestly I miss smaller phones that can be used one handed most of the time, the Classic's trackpad when it does work for me is amazing. I have smaller hands and phones that are more tablet then phone annoy me to no end."
blackberry,36gh6z,intrloper,1 point,Tue May 19 09:16:10 2015 UTC,absolutely love the classic.
blackberry,36gh6z,Raptor007,1 point,Tue May 19 08:38:44 2015 UTC,I got a passport about a month ago. I like it. It is shiny.
blackberry,36gh6z,davidlyster,1 point,Tue May 19 09:15:50 2015 UTC,"I will defend the toolbelt all day, I am having issues with the trackpad from time to time(which my be user error and not hardware) but when it works I love it. It feels so nice and comfortable to use small gestures with one hand to move around without tapping on the screen and swiping around constantly.  First BB was a Pearl then quickly went to a Curve 8300(i think was the model) and the round pearl ball was so so very nice. Having that similar feeling back again is really nice."
blackberry,36gxbs,intrloper,1 point,Tue May 19 08:38:12 2015 UTC,"Couple of questions.  Which phone are you using? For the music, how would you like to sync the music i.e. USB, WiFi, BT, Internet. Silly question, but have you compared phone calls for the audio? Basically making sure it's your phone and not the sources?"
blackberry,36gxbs,SupriseGinger,1 point,Tue May 19 11:33:19 2015 UTC,"BB Classic Music sync Wifi would be fine to use. No other phones to compare audio source. Can compare between my bluetooth headset, wired headset, speaker and earpiece sometime this week but not sure if that will matter."
blackberry,36gxbs,SupriseGinger,1 point,Tue May 19 17:13:51 2015 UTC,"I will have to look at it tonight more closely, but I think Blend should allow music sync without WMP, if not I think there is another way, but I am not sure.   If it does sound different on the headset then it is probably the phone in some physical capacity. If it doesn't then it is probably the source or carrier.   I don't have a classic, so I can't speak to the track pad. Streaming with Bluetooth does use a fair amount of juice, so I don't know if it's abnormal. You might check to see if the device you are streaming to uses a previous generation standard of Bluetooth. I know newer versions of BT are supposed to be more energy efficient, but I don't know if streaming to an older standard uses more power. It might.  I am not familiar with any checkbook apps. Are there any on android that you like? Or are you looking for suggestions that can be found in the Android or BlackBerry store?   I know it's not the most helpful, but this is just off the top of my head."
blackberry,36gxbs,SupriseGinger,1 point,Tue May 19 18:21:06 2015 UTC,The BT tonight almost killed my battery using 56% total. I just use it to listen to Iheart radio.  Also noticed however something very annoying. If I have the profile set to Silence and I place a call then it automatically sets me back to Normal. Is there anyway for it to not do that?  I hate to be such a bother.
blackberry,36gxbs,SupriseGinger,1 point,Wed May 20 05:15:20 2015 UTC,Interesting. What version of OS do you have? That does not happen when I do something similar in 10.3.   I assume you are getting the 56% from the hardware monitor? Is that correct?
blackberry,36gxbs,SupriseGinger,1 point,Wed May 20 08:14:38 2015 UTC,Getting the battery number from the battery usage screen.  10.3.1.1889  But yeah when I have silent mode on and go to lunch I call my son every night. Last two nights it reset my profile back to normal and it is annoying as hell.
blackberry,36gxbs,3SGTO,1 point,Wed May 20 08:20:24 2015 UTC,"That is super weird on the profile settings. I will play with my phone at work to see if I can replicate it. I assume you are going through a BT headset for the calls?  I think some testing is in order for the BT problem. Did you ever figure out if the headset you were streaming to is a BT 4.0 device? I am having a hard time getting a straight answer, but from what I can piece together if you are streaming to an older BT standard it's going to consume more power. Another issue could be if there is a lot of radio noise where you are at the phone might have to increase the power to counter it. You could try streaming in a different place for a while to see if it does something similar ( I doubt this one). Although it says BT, I know streaming music over 4G drains my Z10 super fast. You might try either streaming from audio stored on the device, or not connecting to BT and streaming through headphones to see if it's still draining fast. One other thing you can try is to turn make the device not discoverable once connected. It could be making/getting requests that are draining the battery."
blackberry,36gxbs,stoneeus,1 point,Wed May 20 08:43:23 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply, I have LG Tones+ HSB730: Bluetooth Version 3.0 A2DP & AVRCP seems to be the tech used.  I work in a quiet office but the signal penetration with TMO is weak so always at 1-2 bars, but was same with if not worse with my LG G2 and always left with like 40% battery remaining. I do know the battery sizes are different but didnt think the BB would drain so fast.  Far as streaming music over 4G, I can only go by what the app shows, which was that BT drained a huge amount while IHeart Radio was under 2%. I have no idea if those numbers are right just reading what the phone is reporting.  will have to test with locally stored media but wont be able to do that for a few days since all my music is in the cloud still.  For the profile changing from silent to normal. It has done it under both BT and just handset conditions.  I tested it last night once by putting silence on then calling someone, after i hung up profile was normal again."

At least not with phones with their branded ROMs. It may be the same with any device on their network, as it lay be a handoff limitation in the network.

The big-name Canadian banks have provided their own Tap and Pay solutions through their individual apps, but that's about it. It has a shot in Canada, but I just can't see it working anywhere else. Plus, Apple Pay and Google Wallet are on their way to Canada and could define the market before Blackberry gets a shot at it."

THey also don't have the strange ""our design and UI are sacred"" marketing and will provide as many test devices as you need.  I manage a BES for a relatively small number of users and was given two z10's and a q10 for testing.  It wasn't even a loan, it was free."

blackberry,369tqu,squeegeeboy,4,Wed May 20 16:06:33 2015 UTC,"BlackBerry wanted to do this as well which is why they split the radio files and the core OS files separately.  The idea being that the carrers can perform technical acceptance (TA) the radio files on their own time but if any OS updates needed to be done then BlackBerry can do them whenever.  That obviously fell flat when the carriers pitched a fit over the fact that they still wanted to TA due to their own software being inserted into the core OS.  Arguably, this is why BlackBerry doesn't give a toss about the leaks of software that are out there."

Carriers threw a fit because all of their Tier 1 support is done on the carrier end, and they demanded BlackBerry give them time to learn their moronic staff.  It was ever ever ever so close, I loved getting the early beta version of OSes when I worked there, it was quite awesome to get to play with all the new features before everyone else :D"

There are plenty of cheap Chinese dongles - don't go there.  The Netgear just works.  Most Samsung TVs with their ""AllShare"" are really just Miracast.  LGs call it SmartShare.  Since Miracast is a mirror, it will push anything on your screen to the TV.  It will also work with VPNs where Chromecast won't.  If you use a VPN on your device, like say Zenmate, Miracast doesn't care and will display without issue. Chromecast on the other hand, establishes its own connection to the Internet source, ignoring your device VPN.   So if you were using a device VPN to get US Netflix, Chromecast won't work.  Of course Chromecast can work with a router based VPN."

Getting the phone working after no battery was a challenge, since starting up the phone also dried the battery (so it turned off again because it had 0% battery).  Unlocking the phone was also a challenge, I use picture password, and most of the time the screen timed out before displaying the picture because System was busy :(  Now this 10.2 seems arcaic compared to 10.3, I feel the need to buy the Leap :)"

blackberry,36a0a0,dimex,1 point,Sun May 17 19:11:12 2015 UTC,"Has not happened, and isn't likely to happen.  If you can root the phone, security hasn't been built into the phone from the ground up.

blackberry,36a0a0,Somhlth,4,Sun May 17 19:43:33 2015 UTC,"This. When a BB10 phone starts up, it performs an integrity check of both hardware and software first, before loading features.

blackberry,36a0a0,WiFiForeheadWrinkles,-1,Sun May 17 23:14:44 2015 UTC,"ummm not sure about the comments here.   Rooting on android means that all the manufacturer restrictions put on the device will be removed. For example on samsung or sony phones these companies are responsible for putting in those restrictions. This gives the phone/user super user privileges that are otherwise not allowed. This enables you install lot more powerful apps that are otherwise not allowed to be installed. Rooting doesn't necessarily make your phone vulnerable any more than it is already.   On Blackberry as far as I know, you don't have a separate manufacturer concept. Blackberry makes both the hardware and software. And the restrictions that Blackberry has placed in the device are usually well thought out. It might not even be possible to get rid of those but it hardly matters.   About choosing your own os in phones may not be entirely possible. Every phone os supports it own set of hardware specifications."

You can log into your outlook account using any alias. Of course the problem would be duplicate emails. I'm unsure if setting it to only receive email from the 'main' account by disabling the 'sync email' option from the alias accounts will work.  Specifying which folders to sync, by accessing 'edit email folders settings', along with setting up outlook filters to send emails from each alias into their own folder, will allow you to achieve your request."

I don't know if it's Reddit In Motion, but GIFS will shut off the volume, because what GIF needs volume right? Lol. Not fun when your browsing reddit and listening to music and have it suddenly cut out because the link is a GIF. As for the phone answering thing I'm not too sure. It is better in 10.3.1 and better still in 10.3.2 beta, but still not as smooth as 10.2.1 for some reason."

Initial reviews of the Passport noted this bug back in October when it launched and it's still unresolved as of the most recent 10.3.1 update on Rogers.

blackberry,362g0g,stram87,3,Fri May 15 15:09:59 2015 UTC,"Verizon customers constantly have issues sending texts, on multiple platforms. In the past it has been solved by reboots or deleting text messages as sometimes it's caused by a corrupt database. This issue you have isn't unique really. I've been seeing VZW customers say this for years now."

My Droid never showed this information at least easily. I'm glad it is not a unique issue but sucks for Verizon."

blackberry,362g0g,-rogo-,2,Tue May 19 23:06:34 2015 UTC,"Did you lose service when it started? Since I've had Verizon, I've used a Q10, 2 Z30's, and a 9930 and haven't had one single issue sending thousands of texts a month.  But yesterday (using a Classic for a week), I was on 1X for awhile. I could receive texts, but every one I tried to send gave me the little clock icon, and would never send. After a restart, I got the red X's, and just tapped ""resend"" and they all went without a problem.   Not saying that it isn't a Vzw cross-platform issue, just saying in my case, it's pretty coincidental that it only happened on my Classic, based off using every other Blackberry on Vzw for 6 months with no issues. (although it was also the first time I was using it on 1X, so who knows)   At least the restarts on BB10 are much more bearable than than OS7"

blackberry,360tr9,ottovonbonbon,2,Fri May 15 03:28:39 2015 UTC,"Some good advice here already but you could also try Navfree - it has offline maps like your Nokia so you can download them on WiFi and limit your mobile data costs. I'm told that Waze works well too, though I haven't tried that.  I'm not a physical keyboard person so I can only speak of touchscreens but, with that bias I would lean towards the Z30 or Leap if you can. The form factor of the Z10 is perfect for me but battery life left much to be desired. With Z30 or Leap that problem is fixed. There are third party extended batteries available for Z10 which work well but then cases don't fit etc., so they aren't for everyone. I'll say one word about my experience in coming to BlackBerry: PRODUCTIVITY. Hopefully your experience will be the same; my advice would be to put rules in place on your email (Hotmail in my case) so that unimportant mail doesn't flood the Hub and take your focus away from the other notifications such as text/BBM etc. Do that and I think you will soon decide, as I have, that you don't want a different phone until the other manufacturers can catch up to BlackBerry."
blackberry,360tr9,taliesynD,2,Fri May 15 05:56:31 2015 UTC,"Waze is a nice app, but the voice instructions are not loud enough.

blackberry,360tr9,77slevin,2,Fri May 15 14:33:51 2015 UTC,"I just made this same leap (Lumia 521 to BlackBerry Q5) about two months ago!  I've been so much happier with my ""entry-level"" BB.  The WP8 on-screen keyboard is probably one of the best there is, especially with its swipe typing (whatever its called).  I don't know if BB's on-screen keyboard can do this.  However,  I had moved from a Dell Venue Pro WP7 phone, which had a slideout portrait keyboard that I loved.  I'm not a big fan of on-screen keyboards, but the WP8 implementation was very nice.  I'm happy to be back on a physical keyboard with the Q5, and I would fear moving to anything but the WP8 on-screen keyboard again.  Other than that, though, the BB is drastically better than the Lumia 521, which was severely underpowered and under-spec'd.   The screen size honestly doesn't bother me at all.  The Maps application on BB seems to work well, so I haven't bothered with Google Maps.  You'll be so much happier with any BB's camera after trying to use the Lumia 521, I'm guessing."
blackberry,360tr9,PrintStar,2,Fri May 15 15:16:54 2015 UTC,Thank you for your insight. Your opinion is the reason I posted despite having watched most Youtube reviews and read most z10/q10 posts here. I knew there had to be someone that was in the same situation.
blackberry,360tr9,twstd_reality,1 point,Fri May 15 17:56:06 2015 UTC,BlackBerry maps works perfectly fine and it includes traffic. Google maps works also which is good if you take transit a lot. I would suggest the leap. Nice big screen for around the same price. That or a z30.
blackberry,360tr9,RevisionCuda,1 point,Fri May 15 04:14:48 2015 UTC,"The only problem i have with Blackberry Maps is not being able to search intersections like Google Maps.

The Leap is a new low/mid-end phone, you can get it for about $300. It has about the same specs as the Z10 but the hardware is newer, the battery is twice as good, and it'll come with the latest software out of the box."

I can touch type fast without even needing to look at the phone. The blackberry hub is great and organized well, superb speakers and outstanding battery life, a charge will actually last me a full day with heavy use. Oh and the camera is vibrant and good quality imo :) definitely recommended! It's awesome that you can get mostly any android app on it too. I even have friends asking me to send the link of where I bought my Q10 from because it's that nice. You won't regret your decision :)"
blackberry,360tr9,kiwiro,3,Fri May 15 14:47:46 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to add, that physical keyboard is not only for typing. If you master the key bindings for several application you are much faster than swiping and using touchscreen."
blackberry,360tr9,kiwiro,1 point,Fri May 15 16:02:04 2015 UTC,"My dad has a q10 since it came out and I used it for about a week . At the time, the keyboard didn't feel as nice as the 9900 so I waited for the Classic (which I'm using now).   For lurking reddit and yt videos z10 would be better. If you like to write a lot, the q10 is better. Even on the classic's larger screen, videos are not  as enjoyable as on a full touch phone.   I  love having a physical keyboard, but if I had to choose between the q10 and the Z10 I'd go for the latter because the quality of Q10's keyboard doesn't compensate for the screen size. Obviously, some people like the Q10 keyboard, it's just a matter of preference.   Also the q10 started to have keyboard problems less than 1 year since I bought it."

blackberry,360tr9,LivePresently,1 point,Fri May 15 15:30:56 2015 UTC,"Others have covered maps already. But for Reddit you'll want to get the Reddit in Motion app from BlackBerry World.   The included YouTube app is really just a link to the mobile website, which works fine, and you can use it to Miracast or HDMI out to a TV at full 16:9. But for a better experience you'll want a native app. There a few good third party YouTube apps but the one I like best is ""Fast Tube"" (also in BlackBerry World.

BlackBerry Maps is quite bad, while HERE Maps for Windows is the best navigation system there is. In fact, it's a lot better than Google Maps.

We used a BES server previously, but have moved away from it, it's no longer active. Basically the only thing my users can do with their phones is text message, make calls, and use email which is done through Active Sync. Nothing they do requires a Blackberry ID, but the device sends them alerts every 5 minutes or so informing them that they have not created a Blackberry ID yet."
blackberry,35z10e,squeegeeboy,11,Thu May 14 20:07:15 2015 UTC,The problem with this is that in 10.3.2 they are forcing the BlackBerry ID creation and if you wipe the device then without the original BBID and password the device is useless.  I would propose that as part of the device rollout you create the BBID using a corporate naming convention such as BBID1@<domain.com>.  Asset track the PINs assigned to the BBID and in case you need to wipe the device or headcount reduction then you can reassign to another employee.
blackberry,35z10e,kaydpea,2,Thu May 14 20:47:06 2015 UTC,"As annoying as it is, I think you're going to have to come to grips with explaining to those who insisted on using BlackBerry, regardless as to whether it was functionally the best fit, that a BBID is just going to have to happen.

I've been debating between Q10 or Z10 (since I don't have the budget for newer phones) and because the 521 is small and very, very low spec, the Q10 is actually an upgrade. Also, I tested the Classic at ATT (I'm TMO) and really liked it. This is the only reason I'm leaning towards the Q10, but I'm concerned I'll miss the screen real estate of the full touch phones."

blackberry,35x21t,minusSeven,1 point,Thu May 14 07:12:09 2015 UTC,"1)  I don't, sorry, but it should be simple.  2)  Yes, there are a number of apps to do this.  Parrot Pro isn't very good but I've found Call Recorder from X-Reve to do the job nicely. It even hooks in to your ""cloud"" services such as DropBox, Box or OneDrive to save the audio files.  3)  Drive:  One Drive by Microsoft works perfectly.  The app also sets up sync of pics and video should you wish it.  Keep Music:  Not sure if you are referring to just music in general or storage but you have SD card ability for unlimited storage.  Spotify or other Android apps can be installed from the App stores.  Maps:  BlackBerry Maps is actually quite good if you are doing standard A to B routes.  It falls down on if you want to see what's around.  I use M8 in the UK and NavFree Offline both of which are spot on.  Checkbook:  You have choice of installing your Android App or going native.  If going native (usually the better option) then try Mobile Checkbook.  https://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/674/?countrycode=GB&lang=en All the reviews say it's worth it's weight in sacrificed virgins.  4)  You can debloat using Sachesi or Darcy Tools.  There's not a lot of fat to trim on BB10.  5)  No host file blocking.  You can install Firefox, Chrome or another third party browser though and they come will a lot of ad-block features.  One of the really cool things about the BB Browser is ""Reader Mode"".  Go to a website and it's full of crud, just click the over flow menu (bottom left three dots) and click Reader mode.  Now you can read text perfectly clear without the bloat.  IHTH."

Google is a great company but there privacy policies lately are kinda annoying so wanted to free myself.  in response to a few things:  2) Getting the Classic, the call recording apps do they record both sides correctly? I read that it depends on how the actual phone handles the audio, like my LG G2 doesnt record the other end well unless it is on speaker. Was told it is was that the audio wasnt routed through something to allow it.  3) ""keep music"" was a format mistake when typing. I meant google keep for note taking and google music for online cloud library.  Wanting alternatives for those if possible.  3.1) Will need to find a good drive alternative that values privacy better, I know DropBox had a lot of bad PR over the years for various reasons. Dont know much about the MS service.  4) Mainly what worries me here is if TMO installed a bunch of carrier bloat like ring tone app. etc. I know VZW phones use to come with a ton of crap i never wanted but unless I rooted I wouldnt have been able to remove. I just dont want all that useless software on the phone."

blackberry,35t68w,sacrilegious,1 point,Fri May 15 17:26:28 2015 UTC,"SNAP is a smooth native app that doesn't take up system resources but it can only be side loaded. It is limited in its functionality. Does not auto-update apps and paid apps can only be downloaded if you paid for it previously on your desktop or another Android device. The Play Store and Play Services are Android apps that, although mimic the actual Google Play store, are actual Android apps and that means background running with some system resource usage. Which is fine for the most part as it also means automatic update check and download. For most people I would think the hassle free installation of Google Play Store is good. Snap is good if you don't buy much apps and you don't mind side loading Snap. It is less resource intensive and a nice smooth native app."
blackberry,35t68w,eddy_07,3,Fri May 15 21:02:52 2015 UTC,"Simplest way is to go to your phones browser, download an apk from the interwebs, and install by opening what you downloaded.

blackberry,35qu05,RocMon,20,Tue May 12 19:24:54 2015 UTC,"“Many of the dollars spent with BlackBerry go right back into the local and national economy,” said Chen. “BlackBerry spends more on research and development than any other Ontario company. The $1.3 billion we spend annually also makes us one of the largest R&D spenders in all of Canada. Some 90% of BlackBerry’s research engagements are with Canadian universities and we hire more than 1,000 co-op students from local institutions every year.” Chen added: “As an Ontario-headquartered company, BlackBerry pays corporate taxes in Ontario on revenue generated from sales worldwide, not just in Ontario. Among many other things, we help support the operations of the legislative assembly — and that includes Mr. Qaadri’s salary.”   That about sums it up. They also employ 5,000 people in Waterloo. If we're going to use our tax dollars to pay for MPPs' phones, we'd better get the maximum return on that investment back into our provincial and national economy.   I'm totally fine with MPPs getting taxpayer funded phones to have constant access to things they need to do their jobs - like secure email, secure messaging, internet browser. As a bonus, BlackBerry conveniently leads the field in these things. If they want phones that come pre-installed with Instagram and SnapChat, they'd better use their own money and keep their hands out of my pocket."

The apps that exist go the work-around route where they dial your GV number, hit 2, and then dial out. It's annoying.  If you're committing to BlackBerry, port out of GV. You'll be much happier.  Look at the other thread I posted a few days ago. It has a zip of everything you'll need to get a fully functioning Google Play Store and Google Play Services running on your Passport. Unfortunately, apps like Hangouts and YouTube that are heavily tied into G+ won't work at all (Hangouts) or will load but won't let you login (YouTube).

blackberry,35q0s9,JustCallMeDave,2,Tue May 12 15:51:32 2015 UTC,"Sometimes that happens to me if the screen is really dirty, like after a long phone conversation and the phone is covered in face-grease. Clean your screen?"
blackberry,35q0s9,capn_untsahts,1 point,Tue May 12 17:18:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I tried, but no dice. The thing is, it doesn't highlight EVERYTHING. It's just as I'm scrolling if my finger touches something (IE a title to a post) it highlights that. Doesnt matter what app either, so I'm assuming it's a setting somewhere."
blackberry,35q0s9,bonerconfusion,2,Tue May 12 17:43:25 2015 UTC,"That's the default on the Classic, because of the trackpad, but it shouldn't happen on a Q10."
blackberry,35q0s9,bonerconfusion,1 point,Tue May 12 17:51:26 2015 UTC,Actually it's the classic I have. (Asked about the Q10 because they are pretty much identical and more people seem to be antiquated with them). Is there a way to turn it off on the classic that you're aware of?
blackberry,35q0s9,bonerconfusion,2,Tue May 12 18:05:54 2015 UTC,"Not that I am aware of. It's really annoying. If you think about, BB10 was never supposed to run on a ""tool-belt"" device, it's pretty much the only way to implement it. Unless you'd have a ""cursor""?"
blackberry,35q0s9,bonerconfusion,1 point,Tue May 12 18:54:55 2015 UTC,"It's so distracting. I'll be reading something and sort of randomly the whole text is highlighted. You would think when they took the BB10 OS and plopped it into the classic they would tweak it to include the toolbelt. Or at least give customization options. I swear, it's like BB did NO focus group or product testing on the Q20. There are like 10 minimal changes they could make that would make userability 100X better."
blackberry,35q0s9,bonerconfusion,2,Tue May 12 19:07:45 2015 UTC,"Tbh, it took me quite a bit to decide between Classic and Passport. Having used them both, I actually went for the Passport just because of that annoying highlight on the Classic.   But in retrospect, I wish I would've gone with the Classic. I hate the Passport keyboard. Otherwise an incredible device."
blackberry,35q0s9,2dglasses,2,Tue May 12 19:56:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know that you'd be any happier. The keyboard seems a bit wider than the older BB which I could hold in one hand and type. The device is also heavier so one handed typing is a bit of a challenge. But there are a lot of other little annoyances. For instance, I used to get my emails via wifi on my android device, now I have to use data. If I pause a podcast the app will shut down after a few hours then I'll have to figure out where I was at (I've spent endless time and searched for different apps but still can't correct this.) I'll change something in options and...nothing, toggling it on or off (IE certain notifications) has no effect. And that damn highlighting...grrrrrr"
blackberry,35q0s9,2dglasses,1 point,Tue May 12 20:02:39 2015 UTC,"What OS are you running?  To be fair, that Podcast issue sounds like an app issue? I have YouTube or the music player paused for hours at times...  I have a backup Q10. Still hands down the best BB10 device."
blackberry,35q0s9,2dglasses,2,Tue May 12 20:12:32 2015 UTC,"Hey, it's OS 10.31.1.8. I could see where you'd say it was an app issue. The problem is the interface with BB is such that an app doesn't exactly run in the background if it's open. There's both a notification icon and the full app home screen which you can swipe away from. But if you then close the app it doesn't save your place. This wasn't the case with the identical apps running in android. One of the pulls of the new BB OS was the ability to run native android apps. But my experience has been with, for example, MortPlayer, it doesnt run them very well. Or with, IE Dolphin, it doesnt run them at all. I like the physical keyboard but that's about it."
blackberry,35q0s9,venderhain,2,Tue May 12 21:02:20 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Unless you turn off the ""run in background"" permission, the apps actually should run in the background.   If it's really just the keyboard, you should switch.  I mainly use my phones for two-way communications. Text, message, IM, email, blah, Ergo the keyboard and hub are EVERYTHING to me!  The PP is a step into the right direction. The Classic was a good attempt of BlackBerry to finally start listening to their customers again. The hybrid between those 2 device is where it's going to be.   Android is not an option for me and I've destroyed way to many iPhones, I'm over Apple. BlackBerry it is for now..."
blackberry,35q0s9,venderhain,1 point,Tue May 12 21:22:49 2015 UTC,"""run in background""    I see the 'run when minimized' permission but I don't see a run in background.   I thought when the classic came out 'finally!' A keyboard, small enough, android apps---what could go wrong? The problem is the wonky OS is just...weird. The interface feels unintuitive. There are too many little glitches. I agree, I'll never go with the iphone for a myriad of reasons. But the android OS just felt smoother, more user friendly, less wonky....and didnt use as much data."
blackberry,35oqjn,Nexhume,1 point,Tue May 12 07:21:45 2015 UTC,"hi, i just did some testing.  I see no difference between using blend or sending from my device.  both do appear to be a tad small though, maybe 9pt.  I can't tell where this is coming from, most likely the blackberry itself.  I don't see a place to set a default font size nor any defaults.  It only allows me to change the size while editing the message on the device, and no options to change from Blend.  Seems like a good feature request idea."
blackberry,35oqjn,brkdncr,2,Wed May 13 02:14:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for testing it out. Yeah, it might be something I'm personally experiencing then, because when I send via the Passport it's a regular size (though different color/font than from straight Gmail), and when I send via Blend and read the resulting sent email in Gmail, the font is hilariously tiny. Basically I'm dealing with widely different font sizes/colors/styles on each point of access and dependent on from where it was sent.  Will send them a feature request for Blend though, it would be nice to have some formatting options for outgoing Blend emails."

I don't think AT&T version of Passport ever going to come to Malaysia, so I doubt I'm going to ever seeing it :( I thought the AT&T version only make aesthetic changes only, but after reading your review it seems the changes serves plenty of useful purpose...

blackberry,35c4jj,dimex,1 point,Sat May 9 06:35:26 2015 UTC,"Aside from the wireless charging, what other functionality does the AT&T version have?"
blackberry,35c4jj,whutchadoin,1 point,Sat May 9 18:17:22 2015 UTC,"I'm going to repaste my reply to a thread about a month ago when I asked if there were others who switched from the original Passport to the AT&T. Basically, the AT&T offers better handling and better typing than the original:  Four things come together to make the typing better:   The side rails of the device are flattened. The i-beam design of the original is quite sleek and very sturdy, but it's kinda rounded on the sides. The flat sides of the AT&T version sit better in the hand. Added chin at the bottom let's your thumbs sit in a more natural position. On the original, you're always typing in a crunched position at the bottom of the phone. They must have rebuilt the keyboard. Each key press is far more consistent, softer, and requires substantially less force to press down. Some keys on my original are stiffer than others, and the space bar doesn't always register if I hit the far right side of it. On this AT&T,  everything is equal. They weighted the device differently. The overall weight is the same, but I'm guessing they shifted internals because it feels quite a bit more balanced.   All of these points are pretty much shared by other users as well, over at Crackberry. I typed this entire thing on my Passport with one mistake. It would've taken longer and been less accurate with the original."

There's rumoured to be three including the famous new slider. If not I would go with the Leap to be honest, at 350$C you can't go wrong, this also let's you update quicker."
blackberry,35d6f6,luv2hotdog,2,Sat May 9 05:17:54 2015 UTC,"It comes down to 3 factors now i think :: Size, Keyboard and if you need a battery to be removable. So Size your comfortable with and if you want a keyboard or not and if you want to have a spare battery which is only on the Z10/Q10 i believe still but may be corrected on that. The amoled screen does seem to be different for a lot of people but the same for others i guess is another one."
blackberry,35d6f6,L4wL0rd,2,Sat May 9 18:54:48 2015 UTC,"If you don't specifically want the qwerty and trackpad, go for the z30. It's got better battery life, better antennas (some different technology which is apparently better at holding onto a signal), and is significantly faster.  Ive used both - the classic is great if you really want that keyboard, but it's worse in every other way. Totally worth it if you're like me and like clicky clacky things with lots of buttons, but if you're just as happy with touch only, the z30 is both cheaper and better!"
blackberry,35d6f6,deezy07,1 point,Wed May 13 07:01:01 2015 UTC,Since you've used Q10 you probably ok with amoled screen which Z30 also using. To me I just can't get used to amoled screen.

I can go stay the night at my girlfriend's without bringing any chargers, and after another day of average use there's still almost half the phone battery left.  The Pebble's battery never drops below a mostly-full meter.  But, when I first got my BlackBerry Classic, there was a bug in Verizon's stock BBOS (software release 10.3.1.9xx) that drained my Pebble in less than a day.  It was pretty disappointing.

As you can see it looks like the BlackBerry SMTP servers make no attempt to initiate a TLS connection with CheckTLS. But when sending via the OWA/desktop client, TLS is used.  I would've expected the BIS SMTP servers to use TLS when connecting to CheckTLS's mail servers.  Would this be an issue of how I've connected the device to the exchange acc.?"
