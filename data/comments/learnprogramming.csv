learnprogramming,3e2bns,BaenEndkind,13,Tue Jul 21 20:57:56 2015 UTC,"It depends on the position. I am assuming entry level, however if it is going to be more of a security architecture or engineering position you will want to focus on very different things than for a Monitoring Analyst or forensics position.   In general you will want to be familiar with common attack vectors. The OWASP Top Ten Cheat  sheet is not bad for this. You will also want to understand buffer overflows, social engineering/phishing, along with malware classifications such as  trojans, worms, and rootkits.  Having an understanding of the CIA triad and risk management will also help if you are talking to people more on the information assurance/business side. If you have the time, setting up a VM penetration testing lab with Metasploitable 2 hosting Mutillidae for web application attacks and running through some attacks you find online will both show initiative and provide a better practical understanding of how these attacks function. I would recommend a Kali Linux vm to run the attacks from, it has a vast library of pen testing tools. At the very least I would recommend watching this video.   Questions about binary, hex, the tcp/ip protocol, puplic key crpytography, ports for common protocols and services, and an understanding of some of the more common ones such as HTTP, FTP, SMB, HTTPS, Telnet, and SSH are all common interview questions.   If you will be doing anything involving network monitoring familiarity with wireshark is a must. Even if you have some backround in web development you will want to make sure you understand HTTP status codes in depth, and that they are not always implemented in line with the RFC. You will want to be able to identify a malicious iframe or redirect, php injection, and sql injection from a pcap. While it may not come up in an interview, knowing how to use burpsuite for decoding Base64 and html encoding is useful, see video above for other uses. Basic linux command line will also be very useful, such as using curl to grab the headers/source from a page rather than browsing to it directly, or using netcat to build a custom query modifying your user agent string to that of a vulnerable version of Windows or whatever so an exploit page will drop the malware.   I haven't done much in forensics but you will want to know how to grab an image from a hard drive as well as a live image to capture the full ram contents. You will want to know about steganography and common data hiding techniques. An understanding of cryptography, cracking tools, and both slack and swap space are essential.   Unfortunately I have never done too much in Security Architecture or Secure Programming, so I can't speak much to them. For the latter, researching all of the vulnerabilities mentioned above in depth and how to avoid them will help."

learnprogramming,3e2yp9,nokeechia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:21:38 2015 UTC,"internal flash query tool   I'm not exactly sure what you mean by this, but I think I get the point.  I would recommend trying to talk them into something like TOAD. It's free, easy to set up and extremely flexible both as a work tool and a learning tool for more in depth SQL.  With experience in Excel with pivot tables and macros, you have a great starting point for learning the more robust tools (and I'm pretty sure that both Crystal Reports and SQL Server Reporting Service are available in educational/free/lite versions). You already understand how to retrieve and manipulate data. Now I would guess you need to learn how to shape the data at the query stage (and manage the system resources consumed by your requests) by learning to create views and stored procedures for example.  These will require appropriate permissions on the data store, lots of reading and practice. The bad news is that most companies won't allow a ""rookie"" to do these things. A badly formed query or stored procedure can wreak havoc on a database. I've worked for more than one company where bringing down a database would cost multiple millions of dollars per hour of outtage. They take it VERY seriously.  The good news is, since you're already writing queries, you have some understanding of your underlying data structures and you can mimic them with dummy data on your own time and at your own pace to begin creating useful tools in a completely safe environment (assuming you won't get in trouble for taking the data structures off site or something).  So that would be my advice. If they're leery about letting you learn (and it sounds like you still have a LOT to learn before throwing your resume out into the wild), just do it on your own with the best approximation you can of your own data structure from work.  You'll get plenty of practice in building tables. You'll get to set up your own database(s). You can create all the cool procedures and jobs and etc. to make your own life easier once you talk them into letting you try.  Then you'll have a firm leg to stand on when you're ready to move up.  All of this is of course just opinion based on a very limited understanding of your company, their attitude about the sacredness of their data and you. But this is essentially how I started and it's been an incredible experience so far.  Last thing; I know this seems a bit strange but keep in mind that if you come to them with solutions already built (code that functions, is efficient for the job you do and doesn't crash their databases), then show them the tools you need to build more, they're much more likely to let you out on a longer leash than simply saying, ""x,y and z would be pretty cool.""

Not so with Python, there are Python communities in Gaming, Scientific programming, enterprise programming and all kinds of scripting/bots/scrapers/daemons you name it. Not to mention Django and Flask which are well developed frameworks for web development as well.  Why is ease of use so important?  When you learn your FIRST programming language you are learning TO program. You are wrapping your head around the concepts of programming. This is a much bigger deal then the syntax and behavior of a single programming language. And so you want a programming language that takes the LEAST amount of work to learn so it gets out of your way, allowing you to focus on the things that will actually cause you headache.  Couple that with the fact that learning Python gives you a viable tool you can use for the rest of your life afterwards, and bear in mind that both Javascript and Ruby are so syntactically similar to Python that learning those languages AFTER dominating Python is a matter of a week or two of syntax training.

There's never a way not to if you intend your code to be reasonably stable as you have to understand what type of data you must have at every point and/or check the type at run-time.   pointers   These are harder to learn up front but I honestly think you're better off for struggling through it. If you learn pointers you get a lot of understanding of magic in higher-level languages for free. If you know pointers and at least a bit about the way code is executed by the machine it's obvious why you're able to pass functions to functions or write closures. It clears up what the scope rules of doing so are, too.   You also understand how multi-dimensional arrays work if you understand array indexing as being pointer-based.   I think Python or the like is great for programming 101, but the 201 course should, I think, be C.    lots of boilerplate   For learning projects? Not really. You can get through a decent programming course and write a few good learning projects in C without too many #includes and few if any other preprocessor directives. In terms of 'real' C boilerplate what is there? Well there's the main function, but that's hardly a large bit of code to write in and it reinforces the C model of viewing the program's entry point as being akin to a function call.   All of that stuff goes away with a more dynamic language like Ruby or Python.   Typing? Still there. And here Arguably it's easier to work with a language that implicitly determines your types and lets you change them on the fly, but it's arguably easier to learn good practices and how to think about strict typing - which will always become necessary at some point in programming - if you learn a strongly typed language first.  Pointers? Well somewhat. Certainly the memory safety concerns and memory leaks largely are put on the interpreter, not you, but you still have to do much of the same thinking as you do with pointers in other respects. Passing by reference being the big one and, as previously mentioned, understanding how something like a function as a variable works. A function decorator in Python makes sense from the start if you understand those concepts for example.  Boilerplate? Still plenty of that in many high-level languages. Most without it tend to be using syntactic sugar which is, arguably, worse for a beginner to be dealing with."

At any rate, if your goal is to write a game, you're probably better off learning ruby or python.  If your goal is to learn CS, you could do a lot worse than ML or Haskell.

Both Ruby and JS are scripting languages and dynamically typed (I.e. variables can start as a String and end as an Array). However, JS is a language that runs on the client (most commonly) but CAN be on the server (see NodeJS) whereas Ruby is a beautifully simple (and syntactically awesome) language with less front-end, ""I live on the client's browser"" and a great backend framework (Rails).  While it's important to consider what you want to do in the future, starting with either language won't hurt you. I'd say both, but Ruby if you want to move to backend/server stuff and JavaScript if the following buzzwords are appealing: AngularJS, ReactJS, NodeJS, BackboneJS and you want to make beautifully interactive websites.  Just my thoughts. I started with Python and Ruby and use JavaScript regularly now (working on a huge Backbone application). PM me if you'd like more feedback."
learnprogramming,3e23j8,GottfriedEulerNewton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:44:43 2015 UTC,So a network administrator would be better off learning ruby?
learnprogramming,3e23j8,tropicalrecon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:45:17 2015 UTC,"Ruby does see some presence in Network Administration, but you'll see far more Perl / Python / Bash Scripts / Powershell Scripts in that area than anything else.  Really, though, a Network Administrator should learn whatever environment of switch OS they're using, which is frequently Cisco-based these days.  It's less programming the network equipment directly and more writing programs that tell your switches / routers / firewalls / what have you what to do."
learnprogramming,3e23j8,pat_trick,2,Tue Jul 21 18:53:50 2015 UTC,"Javascript is a hot mess. You will need to 'learn' it as it is widely used in front end development, but pick it up later as it is not a good place for building foundations. Start with Ruby as you will be able to learn the basics of structured object oriented programming, and more importantly best practices you will be able to apply to everything else you pick up going forward."
learnprogramming,3e23j8,ciera22,2,Tue Jul 21 15:06:32 2015 UTC,"Language won't matter much later on. Think of each language as a tool in your toolbox. You could put a screw into wood with a screw gun, screw driver, or a hammer and a lot of time. Pick the best tool for the job by understanding your problem and the strengths and weaknesses of each tool.  What's really important is to understand the concepts around programming. The fundamentals are important as are larger concepts like security, parallelism, memory management, distributed systems, etc.  If you want to get something up and running quickly without worrying about what is behind the scenes, the either JS or Python are probably fine. And it probably doesn't matter which one you use. But if you want to write a very fast distributes application that takes advantage of every available cycle on the CPU, then you probably want C/C++.  A tetris clone might be ambitious for a first project depending on the language since games are terribly complex beasts once you start to get into the nitty gritty details of how they work. I would start by breaking it into smaller modules that you can put together to make the game. For instance, start with managing the tetris pieces. How will you select the next piece? Do you want totally random? How will you keep track of their orientation? Should the piece detect if its in a complete line or should the game board do that?"

learnprogramming,3e23j8,robotfarts,2,Tue Jul 21 13:35:30 2015 UTC,"I like Python because everything fits together in a nice way and you can implement your own magic methods to make your code really elegant.  For example I can have a record of customers with some information attached,  class Record:     def __init__(self):           self.customers = []           self.date = ...         ...      def __len__(self):         return len(self.customers)      def __iter__(self):         return self.customers      ...   Now you can do for customer in record: which will call the __iter__ method to get an iterator.  Of course there are much more complicated things you can do. It's kind of like operator overloading but much more flexible since you can do things like returning iterators, or converting to a string representation. You can of course define functions that use custom methods like these and then use them in your own classes.  There are also some very nice features like generators and decorators which are extremely useful. All these things just make python code so nice to read and write."

If you like solving puzzles, you can both solve puzzles and learn various Python libraries on the way by doing the Python Challenge. There will be quite a bit of simple string/file/image/audio/? manipulation for you to learn.  Or you can decide it's time to dip your toes in a small project. For that, you should first learn basics of object oriented programming in Python (links: 1 2 ). Then, a few fun ideas for a small first project:   a small reddit bot doing... something (for example replying to your every comment containing a string on your own private subreddit) using Requests and Reddit web API follow the Django tutorial if you are interested in writing web applications, it's very well written or you can always try and write your first game using pygame   I would recommend doing a bit of PyChallenge first (if you stick with it, it has really good coverage across the libraries and forces you to flex your google skills) and then starting a small project.  Ah, remembered one more site, which may be perfect for you, nevermind, it IS perfect for you: checkIO. Check it out first.

This is fine we all have those problems but you need to MAKE yourself spend at least 30 min (preferably an hour) a day on some kind of focused project that you can use to learn.   Put down the books and the tutorials and just start building. When you reach a road block, ask for advice on stack over flow or here. Don't worry about down votes. We all get them.   And don't switch projects until you are done!!  Maybe you see a shiny new language you might want to learn?  Ignore it!  Do nothing else until you get that project done. Then evaluate what you learned and go to the next project.   Like me, I committed myself to learning Flask and building a simple stretch reminder web app and I work every day on it.  It may be a stupid idea and poorly coded but at the end of the day at least I will have a final finished product that I can show! :)"

learnprogramming,3e480p,Iamnotarobotchicken,3,Tue Jul 21 20:51:32 2015 UTC,You need to wrap your paths in quotes like open('myfile.txt').

learnprogramming,3e1dwz,hhhhhwheatthins,8,Tue Jul 21 12:34:52 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming that you're going to be starting college for the first time this August?   In that case, it may be helpful to know that pretty much every single ""intro to programming"" class (in high school, college, whatever) will start by assuming you have absolutely 0 knowledge of how to program, and will start from the absolute beginning.  As a result, it would actually be perfectly fine to not study at all, and just spend the summer relaxing and doing whatever it is you prefer to do.   That said, if you want to get ahead, I recommend that you pick some project, and build something you enjoy. Use programming in whatever manner you find the most fun. If you enjoy learning new programming languages, learn a new language. If you have an interest in doing gamedev, build a basic arcade game. Find an interesting dataset? Spend some time exploring + analyzing it.   The more actual hands-on experience you get writing working code, the better, and the best way to motivate yourself to code is to pick a project you enjoy working on.  Anyways, to answer your specific questions...   Spend my time learning C++?   You could, though I wouldn't place it at a priority. The hardest part of programming is learning how to problem solve, not learning a new language.    Build on what I know in Java already with online video tutorials?    If you want. Pick what you want to do first, and then pick your language second.   I am also interested in game development with Unity, but that would require learning C#, should I do that?    If the thing that interests you most is making games with Unity, then do that. Spend about an hour learning C#, then move on to working through the Unity tutorials.   There are Hackathons at my school so maybe I should learn some sort of app development?   Just as a note, you can build anything you want at hackathons, not just mobile apps. I've seen people build websites, build robots, hack something together using graphing calculators, build a game using Kinects + drones, build a regular desktop game (using Java, Python, whatever)...   Should I just learn basic computer science concepts on khanacedmy?   Only if that's the thing you want to do above all else.   I would prefer something structured if possible, like a Udemy series.    I would actually argue that you should do the opposite -- start with a structured course/tutorial, but then try branching out to doing independent learning + googling. Learning how to become an independent learner is a very valuable personality traits for programmers to have (a programmer's best friend is google), and the sooner you can start down that road, the better.   I know the answer is usually ""figure out what you want to do,"" but I feel like my situation sort of limits that. Learning too many languages in a short time span is bad, from what I've heard. At the same time, I don't want to waste this time being introduced to something that I'm just going to be taught in school in a month. I'm just trying to figure out the best course of action with just a month before I start college.    Pick something that sounds like fun, whether it's gamedev, mobile apps, Unity, learning a new language, what-have-you. If you're having fun, you can't really call your month a waste (and no matter what topic you'd pick, you'd automatically be learning something useful)."

learnprogramming,3dzif8,JoeQuery,18,Mon Jul 20 20:42:58 2015 UTC,"Depends on what exactly you need to do. The simplest way is to just write a file with whatever information you need to get across, then give the second program the file.   If you need to pass information between two running programs, the way to do it is networking -- usually by establishing a socket-based connection between one and the other, which is typically done in a client/server model (scroll down the Wikipedia page to read about it).   That's for just raw data, though (as in, plain strings). If you need to move more complex data from place to place, you need to decide on a common format that both the sender and the recipient understand. Two very common ways to do this are XML and JSON, though a lot of other formats exist. The choice is made depending on how rigorously you need the format to be defined (how easy it is to find errors)  For a practical example, check out HTML:  <p>    <strong>HTML</strong> is <em>totally</em>   <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"">awesome</a>! </p>   This is a webserver (maybe something like PHP or Python) speaking to your web browser (C, Java, or whatever), telling it to render something that looks like this:   HTML is totally awesome!   The last step is combining the ""transport""* that I described first, with the ""protocol""* that I described second into an actual structured way to get data around. The outcome is usually very case specific, such as:   HTTP, transporting HTML and other formatted data, for your web browsing HTTP, transporting XML/JSON, for an easy way to have programs talk to each other in a server/client system (see: REST) Protobuffers, a way to move complex ""object"" structures between disparate languages. MIME, for getting your email and its parts/attachments (in their variety of formats) from place to place SSH or VNC for controlling a computer remotely. Your favorite multiplayer game's proprietary/secret format for sending game state and interaction data back and forth. SSL, transporting scrambled/encrypted data to accomplish a secure connection (HTTPS is HTTP inside SSL, for example)   It all gets rather complex and next to impossible to work with manually, so code usually ends up using a library or other set of tools to deal with it, such as Python's requests for dealing with HTTP, or C's socket library for plain sockets, or others.  I hope this was informative! If you had a specific use case in mind feel free to ask (though I am not super-familiar with C++, and not at all familiar with C#).  * Note: I am aware ""transport"" and ""protocol"" are loaded words in this context and my use does not align perfectly with their definitions, but they fit the explanations and are a good way to think about the separation between the communication medium and serialization layers."

learnprogramming,3dzif8,pipocaQuemada,2,Tue Jul 21 12:47:13 2015 UTC,"My motivation is primarily due to laziness/fear of C++.   There's a couple of C++ libraries  - physics engines for games - that I really want to try out. But I have near-zero C++ experience. I'd rather using a scripting language (eg Python) , perhaps C# or anything easier to call the C++ libraries.   The motivation is that I'm a hobbyist who wants to make a computer game prototype that is a ""realistic"" space sim. But I'm lazy and don't want to write the whole engine myself, so I want to combine a bunch of other people's engines. The problem is that the 2 biggest Game Engines, Unreal 4 and Unity, both use a crappy physics engine called ""PhysX"". PhysX makes a bunch of approximations that don't sit right with me, particularly concerning rigid body rotations and angular velocity and Euler's equations of motion. This is especially important when a big component of (a properly made) space sim is performing rigid body rotations of the space ship.  Right now I'm in no shape to write my own game engine or physics engine, so I was hoping to cobble together a solution by calling C++ code for a physics engine called ""Newton Game Dynamics"" that promises deterministic physics calculations. This would be much easier if I happened to be a C++ expert. But I'm not.  I guess my ultimate question is, to do what I want, do I need to take several months/years to learn C++, or can I cobble it together with some magic glue and scripting?"

There's actually something that exists for that in Python! C/C++ Extensions!  That page contains a rough overview of how it is done. It's not terribly friendly because of all the abstraction and funkiness needed to let C/C++ code compile into a Python module, but the overall gist of it is:   Write some C/C++ code that interacts with the C/C++ library you want to use (Newton Game Dynamics in this case) Write some specialized C/C++ code on top of that using <Python.h> to define a Python module using C/C++. Compile that code into a file like ""mymodule.so"" In Python: import mymodule   You then get access to running those C/C++ functions from Python as if they were any other Python function. The biggest downside is it's then up to you to do integration between that and whatever game engine you end up using.   Since that's a bit overcomplicated, you might want to first check if someone has already done the work for you. It looks like the Python Ogre graphics engine has (or had, last release was years ago) built-in support for Newton Game Dynamics? Maybe there is a more recent project that does something similar.  Hope that helped!  Ed: Adding on: the reason I immediately jumped to Python.h and direct integration of C into Python code is because it is far faster than any socket communication solution you may come up with. Sockets and any protocols on top of them add a big chunk of overhead and latency, so they're not really appropriate for low latency, high volume calculations like live graphics/physics simulation."

RPC specifies a way of communicating between different applications across network boundaries (of course this works locally as well). A popular framework is Apache Thrift, which is enabling an easy communication between a wide array of different languages.

So no, you really don't need to care that much about it. In the end it's 'just a database'. You're much better of learning to interface with traditional relational databases such as Postgres or MySQL first."

learnprogramming,3e20us,gmdm1234,2,Tue Jul 21 20:22:53 2015 UTC,"Google will answer your first question, and inform your second.  Basically there's a few different broad categories of database systems.  The most common is a ""relational"" database - your data model is described as a collection of tables.  Each table basically represents an object.  The columns in the table represent attributes of the object.  Each row in the table represents a different instance of the object (you've probably made dozens of Excel spreadsheets that follow this basic design.)  The ""relational"" part comes from the notion that one of the columns in a table may contain a pointer to a row in a different table, thus forming a relation between the two tables.  MongoDB falls into a different type of database - sometimes called ""NoSQL"", ""post-relational,"" ""document-oriented,"" or ""hierarchical.""  Rather than storing data in a tabular structure of rows and columns, the data is stored in a hierarchical tree structure.  The root nodes of the tree represent objects, and each subnode represents some attribute of that object.  If you've ever serialized objects into XML or JSON, that's a pretty good way to visualize how MongoDB treats data.  In a relational database, the ""schema"" for the data is pretty rigidly defined - the columns (and their data types and other meta data) are strongly defined, and all data must conform to that definition.  In something like MongoDB, the schema is much looser (maybe not defined at all at the database layer), which allows the programmer to basically store any attribute of any object in any way they want.  Should you care?  Maybe.  The different types of databases have different strengths and weaknesses, and there are times when something like Mongo is superior to a relational database.  However, there's been a lot of hype surrounding Mongo et al lately - so its being heavily (albeit inappropriately) used amongst audiences easily wooed by buzz words.  Meanwhile, relational databases are still the work horse of the majority of database implementations today - and, realistically, and probably the better option for the vast majority of database needs.  If you know nothing about databases right now, practice using something relational like SQLite, MariaDB, etc.  If you have a working knowledge of relational databases and want to hack on something fun with Mongo, go right ahead."
learnprogramming,3e20us,sepehrhm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:43:06 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, if you know relational databases and their practice (i.e. SQL and all its variants - PostgreSQL being the most popular and useful IMO), you can easily pick-up MongoDB when you need to.  A lot of young developers do not need SQL for their database functionality (primarily at startups), so they go by MongoDB.  You can find a post on /r/programming front page on why using MongoDB is a bad idea.  I personally prefer SQL models, but I have a weird interest in DB design and relational models etc. that goes on behind the scenes."
learnprogramming,3e20us,savage884,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:06:27 2015 UTC,"Mongo is very different from a relational database. Doing the one like the other will result in the one being really slow. If you want to do relational data, don't use mongo. If you want to have documents instead of relationships, don't build your database on relationships.  Some understanding of both is required to know which one you want to start with."

Enums can have specific integer values and the simplest solution to your problem is probably:    enum E { Aval = 1, BVal = 42, CVal = 666 };   Of course this won't work if the values can change over time.  As to where to put the table, assuming it is needed, that depends on how it is going to be used, but it would normally be a member of a class, probably a static one. You could also make it a static variable member of a function if it is not going to be changed, but as I pointed out in that case you may not need a hash table.  Basically, what data structure you use, and where you put it depends on a lot of factors, few of which you have described in your question."

learnprogramming,3dzxyp,wtf_lag,4,Mon Jul 20 22:01:38 2015 UTC,"are the variables not declared inside the init() supposed to be static variables?   They can behave that way as long as you consider them immutable.  For example, you can have:  class A:   i = 5  a = A() print a.i # 5 print A.i # 5   But if you do this, then it doesn't work:  a.i = 10; print a.i # 10 print A.i # 5   I can explain more about why this is if you'd like.   and why do I need to pass self as an argument to each method?   Not exactly.  Actually, self is a parameter of each method, but you don't need to pass it as an argument to make a method call.  This happens in java for you as well, but it's just implicitly done there."

learnprogramming,3dzxyp,michael0x2a,2,Mon Jul 20 23:11:01 2015 UTC,"I'm used to creating my variables in the class and then using them in the constructor, why are there 2 ways to do that in python?   There are also two ways to set variables in Java as well. In Python, doing:  class MyClass(object):     foo = 3   ...is basically equivalent to making a static field named 'foo' in Java, and doing:  class MyClass(object):     def __init__(self):         self.foo = 3   ...is basically equivalent to making a regular instance field in Java.   And why do I need to pass self as an argument to each method?   It's partially to make metaprogramming easier. For example, take the following snippit of code:  import math  class Point(object):     def __init__(self, x, y):         self.x = x         self.y = y  def magnitude(point):     return math.sqrt(point.x**2 + point.y**2)  # ...later... Point.magnitude = magnitude  # monkeypatch the class test = Point(3, 4) print(test.magnitude())  # 5 print(magnitude(test))   # 5   There's a nice theoretical duality here -- if we have an explicit self variable, it becomes very easy to promote a regular function into a method.  For more info, see Guido's post on why he feels 'self' is a good idea (Guido is the inventor of Python)."
learnprogramming,3dzxyp,glemnar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:53:13 2015 UTC,It's not exactly the same as a static. Each instance still has it's own instance of the variable.  class Foo(object):     foo = 1  foo1 = Foo() foo2 = Foo() foo1.foo = 7  foo1.foo == 7 and foo2.foo == 1   An unfortunate thing is you can change Foo.foo an new objects would inherit the new version. (I would never recommend something you don't intend to be immutable and on every instance be instantiated in that manner)
learnprogramming,3dzxyp,michael0x2a,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:50:11 2015 UTC,"Close, but not exactly. When you do foo1.foo = 7, what you're doing is creating a new instance variable that happens to share the same name as the static variable. So it's not that each instance has an independent instance of the static field -- it's just that in Python, it's very easy to create new attributes and fields at whim. So then, if you want to modify the static variable, you need to do Foo.my_field = 7.   Example:  >>> class Foo(object): ...    bar = 1 ... >>> foo1 = Foo() >>> foo2 = Foo() >>> >>> Foo.bar = 7 >>> print(foo1.bar, foo2.bar, Foo.bar) 7 7 7 >>> >>> # creating a new instance variable that shadows the static field for foo1 >>> foo1.bar = 42   >>> print(foo1.bar, foo2.bar, Foo.bar) 42 7 7 >>> >>> # foo1 still has the instance field shadowing the static one >>> Foo.bar = 0 >>> print(foo1.bar, foo2.bar, Foo.bar) 42 0 0 >>> >>> # Now delete the attribute, removing the shadowing >>> del foo1.bar >>> print(foo1.bar, foo2.bar, Foo.bar) 0 0 0   The main difference between Java and Python here is that in Python, you can't try and modify a static variable through a reference to the instance, since Python will default to just directly creating the field on the instance itself.   In contrast, since you've already specified all of your fields, Java will permit you to take a shortcut + modify a static field by qualifying it with an instance. (Though, I'd argue that using this shortcut is actually probably bad style, and would argue that it's better to be explicit about what you want and always do something like Foo.bar in both Python and Java if you want to access/modify the static field.)"

Node will give you not only a great introduction to JavaScript, but it allows you to see different areas of the way the Internet works.  You can also get started on this with no charge.  iOS development requires a developers fee and while personally i find it extremely fun to program in, it abstracts away so much that you'll learn so much more through node."

One thing i did find out is that they run the software on virtual machines running the 'eComStation' OS, Java 6 can run on this OS. Something that popped into my head, which im unsure if it could work, would be to build our side of the software in Java, including the interfaces. I've seen screenshots of their system, its a simple menu system that when you click on the buttons they pop open new windows for different functions of the software. I dont know if its possible to do this, but wouldn't a simple solution be to just build buttons into the old system that pops open windows from the newer Java system? that way they have easy access to the newer functionalities, it 'seems' to be part of their current interface, but those newer functionalities/interfaces are not actually written in the old technology.

Obviously its impossible to know whats possible without their current system specifications. One of the reasons why its so weird is because they are the actual creators of this system! i can't really say much about it but the company we are trying to get the actual contract off uses the system created by the guys/company i am talking about in the above paragraphs, those two companies are owned by another bigger company, so one arm of the bigger company wants our technology, the other arm is affraid that it will be too much work to implement it. So what i need to do is convince the creators of the system that its not a big job for our technology to integrate with theirs. They have the power to stop this from happening if they feel that they will have to do too much work on their side, so i need to be able to talk to them and give them some example appoaches to how this might be done. They can give me all the specification i need, but we will be having a meeting about the technical feasabilities of the project where i need to be able to talk positively about this integration.

learnprogramming,3e23nk,VirtualSmash,2,Tue Jul 21 10:51:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with the author that codeacademy tends to encourage a shallow understanding of any particular platform, though I thought I might expand on one point:   *Codeacademy should not be used as a crash course in the syntax of a particular language if you are an experienced programmer* looking to pick up a new skill. I do work with programmers who disagree and recognize that some resources are more useful to some people than they are for others. In my experience however, I've had to relearn anything I've learned using codeacademy. The sanitized environment you complete their challenges in doesn't reflect applied situations and makes it hard to see your code in context. I began to feel that way when I attempted to use the site as a way to learn basic javascript. I found the tutorials, at least for javascript, were not simply insufficient, they were downright misleading. I've briefly explored the lessons for other languages but don't feel comfortable saying definitively if my problem with codeacademy is unique to me, the particular lesson I took or the entire platform. That being said, I know that it has been valuable to people looking to have their first introduction to writing code (again, the author says this) and wouldn't discourage anyone from giving codeacademy a shot if that format is useful to you.   tl;dr codeacademy is a resource that may be useful in the early stages of learning to code but IMO will almost definitely become counterproductive if you use it as a resource as you become more experienced.  I'd love to hear from anyone who finds codeacademy useful. I could very well be the minority."

Where Python is good is when speed doesn't matter quite as much - or where the time to write the program matters than the time it takes to run it.  Python generally lets you write far less code to do just as much. You can go from idea to solution in much less time. C++ makes you write a lot more code, but that allows you to be more efficient. Python lets you be concise but it's slow because it has to be general-purpose.  Finally, read the FAQ and note that beginners get really worried about what language to learn.

First of all, it's not just ""learning 6502 assembler.""  The 6502 instruction set by itself is very simple compared to other modern instruction sets.  (The Intel x86/x86_64 instruction set reference is thousands of printed pages, for comparison.)  But you aren't just learning 6502 assembler; you can't actually do anything with just the instruction set.  For example, to draw a pixel on the screen, you'd need to know how to set up the video controller to get the desired video mode as well as how that particular mode of the video controller works: pixel format, memory layout (planar, linear, banks, etc.), refresh rates, blanking intervals, interrupts, etc. as well as how any other related hardware (e.g. sprite overlays) interact with the video controller.  Not only that, but this hardware was undocumented to those without access to development kits.  I'm assuming that someone has reverse engineered the hardware fully and published the specs somewhere, but remember that someone had to do that and you can't necessarily count on that being the case for systems that aren't as popular as the NES.  But that's not all, you are also reverse engineering a very complex software artifact.  You'd have only a disassembler dump of the code, with no meaningful labels or names.  You'd have to work out what everything is and does, unless somebody has already done that work for you and shared it publicly.  This can take months even for someone that has an expert knowledge of the 6502 instruction set.  And you still haven't gotten to the point of actually changing anything yet."
