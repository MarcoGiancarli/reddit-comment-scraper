When Sarah says that she couldn't tell anyone what she had lost, it was like a punch to the gut. And, I also really like Sarah and Mark bonding moments."
orphanblack,3e2mno,Biomirth,3,Tue Jul 21 16:23:18 2015 UTC,"I also loved this scene quite a bit. It also has that subtle eyebrow raise from Art (Kevin Hanchard) and it's easy to join him in a sense of ""What the hell have I gotten myself into with these sisters""?  Sarah's emotion in the scene also reminds me of the scene with Kira where Sarah tells Kira that when she was her age she was really angry, so confused, and that she doesn't want that for her.

Sarah's dream sequence with Beth - TM's performance of Beth is really powerful, and it just plain hurts to see the flashback of her jumping in front of the train.  2. Helena stabs Parsons in the brain - Another great horror scene where we see Helena's internal struggle and compassion as well as some really good acting by Ari Millen.  3. The intervention when we find out Aynsley BLEW therooferatthecabin!!! - All time classic Alison tirade with bonus points if you watch Donnie closely...it looks like he realizes Alison thinks Aynsley is her monitor.

orphanblack,3dwdp3,paris86,7,Mon Jul 20 02:16:07 2015 UTC,"They didn't know who they can trust. The people closest to them turned out to be Dyad monitors for crying out loud. One wrong move with something as big as going public could have gotten them and their loved ones killed (like what happened with Helsinki). Also, coming out would mean major changes in their lives even if they did get around Dyad. They're gonna become instant celebrities/freaks. It's completely reasonable that they wouldn't want that to happen, especially for someone like Alison who took so long to come to terms with being a clone. Finally, coming out would mean all the other clones who are still in the dark would become self aware too. As we saw from Sarah towards Krystal, she didn't want to put the burden of self awareness on Krystal. As far as we know, most of the clones live fairly,normal lives. If they became self aware, they would have also been dragged into the craziness."
orphanblack,3dwdp3,ca1cifer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:50:50 2015 UTC,All very valid points. I have to admit I didn't consider the other clones out there. Do you think the we will ever reach a stage where we know all the clones? Theoretically there could be hundreds but we have already met or heard of 12?(I think). It was stated in the show that there were 6 Castors so I can't imagine the disparity would be orders of magnitude. We must be pretty close to knowing all the clones by now.
orphanblack,3dwdp3,00Broobs00,2,Mon Jul 20 03:16:16 2015 UTC,They said sick soldiers not 6. There's more than 6 castor clones.

I thought Mark was in the 'Sammie' group, implying more groups, thus more Castor's and I think we'll see some more next year by what John and Graeme say. Also, that explained why Mark did not recognize Paul when they met in the bar is season 2, and Paul said he knew of Mark but kept quiet so as to not blow their respective covers."
orphanblack,3dwdp3,RustyPhishook,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:53:24 2015 UTC,"I don't remember the show saying there were only 6 Castors. Even still, since Castor and Leda were made by different groups of people for different reasons, it's reasonable for there to be different quantities of Castor and Leda clones. If we get to a point were we see all the clones, I'm thinking that would be near the end of the series. Though the show does go at a rapid pass, so who knows."

orphanblack,3dijnc,slightlyaw_kward,25,Fri Jul 17 02:20:34 2015 UTC,I am so happy about the nominations for Best Leading Actress!  I am so happy that Viola Davis and Taraji P. Henson got nominated because they totally deserved it. But Tatiana Maslany got me so pumped up!

orphanblack,3dijnc,dreasurvive,15,Thu Jul 16 18:05:47 2015 UTC,I'm gonna be THAT bitch and ask why was she not nominated 5 times? ;3
orphanblack,3dijnc,zixkill,17,Thu Jul 16 17:24:29 2015 UTC,What am I supposed to do with all these torches and pitchforks now?  I'm shocked the Emmy voters finally got their heads out of their asses.
orphanblack,3dijnc,serdogg,6,Thu Jul 16 16:57:04 2015 UTC,"To be fair, they'd have had to have been deaf to not hear all our complaints!"
orphanblack,3dijnc,DwendilSurespear,3,Thu Jul 16 22:35:33 2015 UTC,I think we scared them into submission.
orphanblack,3dijnc,serdogg,5,Sat Jul 18 00:31:46 2015 UTC,"Save the torches & pitchforks for in case she loses. Yes, there are other good actresses, but let's be honest here, Tatiana is the best of them all. No one else does what she does."
orphanblack,3dijnc,jaded_gal05,3,Fri Jul 17 04:25:52 2015 UTC,"I really don't think she's going to win.  I'm just happy that they are finally showing some appreciation for her work by nominating her.  It gets the show and her name out to the general masses.  The show has a dedicated following but most people haven't heard of it or given it a shot.  But then I didn't think she had a chance at getting nominated, so I'm shit at predictions.  I'd say she's a legit dark horse though."
orphanblack,3dijnc,serdogg,15,Sat Jul 18 00:20:33 2015 UTC,"On a more interesting note, which episode should be submitted?"
orphanblack,3dijnc,Vavavoom180,16,Thu Jul 16 16:57:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was wondering the same. It would be from season 3, right? I'm thinking episode 6, maybe - for the Sarah and Beth scene? Oh boy, that has the twerking too, though... hmm."
orphanblack,3dijnc,ThaBenMan,11,Thu Jul 16 17:13:31 2015 UTC,"My choice would be ""Community of Dreadful Fear and Hate"".  While every OB episode is a great display of TM's range, I think 3x07 had all the right ingredients for Emmy voters unfamiliar with the total scope of the show."
orphanblack,3dijnc,rackcitytourismboard,7,Thu Jul 16 18:44:45 2015 UTC,"""Certain Agony of the Battlefield"" imo, she killed it hard on the Beth-Sarah scene."
orphanblack,3dijnc,MisterrAlex,2,Thu Jul 16 19:34:15 2015 UTC,"I think 3.01. It's got everything, clone swaps, Rachel, Helena, plus the four clone scene as well as emotional scenes for Sarah and Cosima.  I think she will submit 3.06 though!"
orphanblack,3dijnc,00Broobs00,2,Fri Jul 17 07:30:33 2015 UTC,"As others have said, Episode 6 is a solid choice.  That was the wham episode.  However, the finale is another option.  After all, as impressive as 6 was, I think it may have more been resonant to fans than it would be to Emmy voters.  The nomination is specifically for Tat, and in the finale she plays all six of the season's surviving clones.  In fact, the second act cycles through them all in the space of ten minutes.  In one or two minute vignettes, starting at roughly the 13 minute mark:   Cosima and Scotty visit with S and her mother to take samples. Sarah and Felix give Mark and Gracie a wake-up call. Krystal wakes up and lets Delphine know that not only is she not Rachel, but that everything is not fine. Rachel awakens next to a display of Darwin's finches with a brand new eye. Helena and Jesse catch up in his tow truck, but are interrupted by familial responsibilities. Alison, Donnie, and her supporters cast their vote at the polls.   Then at the end of the episode there is the four clone dinner sequence."
orphanblack,3dijnc,adashiel,2,Fri Jul 17 14:54:28 2015 UTC,"""Certain Agony of the Battlefield"" is definitely a great look at Tat's talent, but I think you make a great point. Exposing voters to all of the clones really underscores just how incredible she is as an actor. It really boils down to whether or not it's better to show a few clones and develop how well she plays them or to show all of the clones and show how well she slips into their different personalities."
orphanblack,3dijnc,Vavavoom180,12,Fri Jul 17 16:18:46 2015 UTC,"Well done, sestra."
orphanblack,3dijnc,lastofthetrue,11,Thu Jul 16 18:20:36 2015 UTC,"After passing her up the first two years, I honestly thought that it was done. I just didn't think she'd ever get a nomination. HOLY FUCKING FUCK!  This is amaaaazing, both for her and for BBC America, with this probably being their first ever Emmy nomination in any category. I REAAALLY hope they spend the money to make sure that they promote her right. She's going up against some tough competition (probably the toughest category this year)."
orphanblack,3dijnc,Protanope,9,Thu Jul 16 18:48:15 2015 UTC,"Fucking finally! You go, girl!!!"
orphanblack,3dijnc,NeilPoonHandler,9,Thu Jul 16 16:52:41 2015 UTC,"The nominees in Tatiana Maslany's category (Lead Actress, Drama) are:   Claire Danes, Homeland Viola Davis, How To Get Away With Murder Taraji P. Henson, Empire Tatiana Maslany, Orphan Black Elisabeth Moss, Mad Men Robin Wright, House Of Cards   Empire was a ratings outlier: more viewers each successive week for the entire season.  Taraji P. Henson got massive buzz and publicity for that.  Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) had an excellent story arc on Mad Men. The series is over and voters may acknowledge her for years of quality work.  I think Tatiana Maslany is beyond fabulous but she's got some challenging competition."

orphanblack,3dijqd,LascielCoin,4,Thu Jul 16 15:58:11 2015 UTC,Awesome! So deserved. Say what you will about the theme or plot of the show but her acting skills are unmatched imo.
orphanblack,3dijqd,POOPING_AT_WORK_ATM,3,Thu Jul 16 16:13:32 2015 UTC,It's too bad they base the nominations on actor rather than character.  She could sweep them otherwise.
orphanblack,3dijqd,adashiel,3,Thu Jul 16 16:38:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but I would counter that by saying that Tat just costarred in a movie playing a young Helen Mirren ('legitimizing' her) while Viola Davis is going to be in a superhero movie ('knocking her down a peg'). A lot of it is political bullshit and awarding bodies of work rather than the performance but considering Tat plays 5 fully fleshed out characters she's been working the equivalent of 15 years. >_>  Award math is fucked up."
orphanblack,3dijqd,zixkill,2,Thu Jul 16 17:29:11 2015 UTC,She's so good she could play a young Morgan Freeman.

orphanblack,3dh4tt,OldeMaunciple,4,Thu Jul 16 11:57:11 2015 UTC,She's one of my favorites. Rachel deserves more love :)

orphanblack,3dh4tt,BigRichFromWork,6,Thu Jul 16 14:08:58 2015 UTC,"I would have to go with Helena as well. She's terrifying but also adorable. She's brought some great horror scenes to the show, as well as cute and hilarious ones, too. It's so interesting how different she is from the other girls because of her upbringing. And her and Sarah's relationship is really moving to me (I call my sister ""sestra"" all the time now, haha). If it tells you anything, this is probably my favorite scene in the entire series.  I do love all of them, though. Sarah is great as the driving force behind the show, getting to the bottom of the mystery. Rachel is so interesting, too - I hate her at times but also feel so bad for her. And I love Krystal! I really hope we'll see more of her in season 4."
orphanblack,3dh4tt,ThaBenMan,6,Thu Jul 16 14:42:50 2015 UTC,"Top 3:   Helena Cosima Alison   The favorite alternates, tbh. Season 4 got greenlit back in May."
orphanblack,3dh4tt,dcresistance,2,Thu Jul 16 07:28:55 2015 UTC,"Niiice, now I'll just have to wait for Season 4 to come my way. That's a pretty good trio though!"

orphanblack,3dh4tt,zixkill,4,Thu Jul 16 08:37:34 2015 UTC,I feel weird. My favorite is Allison even tho I'm a Sarah kinda girl. I think it's because it took me the longest to accept that Tat plays Allison as well.  I feel even weirder because Tat said at the ComiCon panel that Allison is the clone she'd miss the most if she died.  Does that make it a double vote for Allson? >_>
orphanblack,3dh4tt,zixkill,2,Thu Jul 16 17:52:19 2015 UTC,"Hey, that's okay. Alison deserves your vote too. For me, I've always been attached to Helena and the relationship she has with her Seestra is the best thing because they really act like sisters and get closer and closer with each episode even if sometimes it feels awkward. After Helena, my second favorite is Allison, I don't know why to tell you the truth. I think because she's a mom and she'll fight you to the death if it means that's the way to protect her family. My third fave is Rachel, and I don't think I need to explain why. Rachel's top to bottom fucked-up awesome."
orphanblack,3dh4tt,Batman8989,2,Fri Jul 17 05:02:16 2015 UTC,"My fave overall has been a tie between Sarah and Helena, but Allison...you could probably still prank me with a 'who's that actress?' troll and I'd still have to think about it for a minute. Allison and her craftcave, where she's busy weaponizing glitter."
orphanblack,3dh4tt,00Broobs00,3,Sat Jul 18 09:08:51 2015 UTC,"It took more than a few episodes to see the real her but Helena is my favorite.

She is more outgoing and confident than me so she would be a good influence on me. I love how excited she gets talking about science and how she cares so deeply about her family. I could listen to Cosima all day haha. I get crazy enthusiastic about my interests too but I usually cant talk about them to anyone and I think I could with Cosima. She is also really chill which is something I need to do more often. I get stressed out too much. Helena is really cool too, my second favorite. She is adorable and I just want to give her a big hug.

orphanblack,3dexhy,zixkill,5,Wed Jul 15 19:07:17 2015 UTC,"Helena vs a Frosty machine  The sestras are out one day when they decide to stop at Wendy's. Allison brusquely gets their orders and asks the freckled kid at the counter if they have any low-calorie ranch. Helena spots the Frosty machine behind the counter. 'Sestra Sarah, I need little girl room.' Sarah looks at her for a second and says 'ok Helena but no monkey business.' Helena giggle-snorts and nods agreement before heading to the bathroom. Seeing the employee door she snorts one more time before pushing it open and closing it quietly.  She tries to sneak into the back room for a second before what few senses she has leaves her and she dashed towards the frosty machine. Employees yell but before they can react Helena's slid under them across the greasy floor and crashes into the large stainless steel bulk of the cold dispenser of delicious goo.  Allison gasps. Sarah yells. Cosima stares wide-eyed and more than a little curious about what will happen. Everything in slow motion, people frozen in midair, Helena sticks her head under the frosty spout and opens it up to let the cold creamy frozen dessert pour into her mouth. The endless stream of non-dairy treat sliding into her head like communion, she grasps the machine like a lover and pulls it closer to her. Unfortunately for Helena the machine wasn't bolted down and it becomes unbalanced, toppling over and crushing Helena underneath. When Sarsh gets to her Helena is already dead but the look on her face is one of pure joy. At least she died happy."

orphanblack,3dexhy,ThaBenMan,2,Wed Jul 15 19:12:43 2015 UTC,"Helena vs Jack the Ripper  Skulking down a moonless, foggy night Helena happens across a man in black who rushes past her, head lowered and wearing an odd hat. She senses the air suddenly still behind her and freezes for a second before tucking herself into a ball and rolling towards the man. Unravelling, she kicks up to where his groin is and finds nothing. The man grunts as if acknowledging something touched him but otherwise does not react.  Helena looks up and sees that he's turned around and is pulling a long knife out of the cane he was carrying. His white gloves are soaked in blood and of his face only two glowing red dots are visible. 'Whore! I'll gut you too!' She tilts her head for a second to ponder what he means then narrows her eyes. 'You kill sestras, yes?' The hat brim dips and she feels the red lights piercing her brain. 'Oh yes, he growls. 'Yes I did.'  His knife comes free of its sheathe and he whips it around to slash her face. A trickle of blood falls from a cut on her cheek and she licks it. The inner demon tastes it and Helena grunts, laughing as she launches herself at him.  The man manages to stick the knife in her gut before she's on top of him, head butting him so hard he falls backwards. Pulling the knife free from her stomach she proceeds to slash at him, skin falling away as easily as his oddly tailored clothes.  With the man burbling blood he sputters 'whore' one more time before Helena slashes his throat so hard that the knife scrapes the pavement. 'You don't hurt sestras' she spits at him and runs off into the night, leaving a trail of blood that disappears into the mist."
orphanblack,3dexhy,ThaBenMan,2,Wed Jul 15 19:55:15 2015 UTC,"Alright - Helena vs. Brock Samson from the Venture Bros.  So Helena accompanies Cosima on a shopping trip for science supplies. Cos asks helena to go grab something in the store - syringes, or something. She reaches for the last package on the shelf, right at the same time as Brock does - he and Dr. Venture are stocking up as well.   A tug-of-war over the item escalates into a full-on brawl. Cosima and Dr. Venture stand on the sidelines watching and trading snarky remarks.  Brock grabs Helena and slams her into a shelf and starts choking her out. But Helena grabs a glass flask and smashes it over his head. She kicks him backward, leaps onto him and drives glass shards into his eyes, and then slashes his throat open for good measure. Then she picks up the contested item and walks over to Cosima and an aghast Dr. Venture. She tosses it to Cos - ""Let us go, sestra - I am hungry."" and walks to the exit.  They silently watch her go. Then Dr. Venture hands Cosima a business card - ""Well, I've just had an opening for a bodyguard position, if she's looking for work."""

I have a rule to only start to see series when they reach the end of the third season (sometimes I break it). It wanted a long time to see this series. The story fascinated me since I heard about the series, but the fear that was canceled kept me attached to the rule... I began to see the series and the fascination did not existed. I remember many visits to the phone as I watched the first few episodes. The first two episodes ""existed"" a lot of times on TV until I saw them really. Then it became extremely addictive. I only stooped watching it to go to work and for sleep (sleeping hours in those days were quite small). Orphan Black became one of my favorite series! Good thing I did not give up! ;)"

orphanblack,3d57fk,jsz,12,Mon Jul 13 17:23:36 2015 UTC,"Everyone at the Orphan Black panel was pretty clear on Paul being dead. Versus Delphine, who they were intentionally ambiguous about.  Game of Thrones does the same thing; if a character is killed off in the previous season then they usually show up at SDCC to say goodbye to the fans. People are actually speculating that Jon Snow is still alive; one of the ""pieces of evidence"" being that Kit Harington didn't show up to this year's Con."
orphanblack,3d57fk,whosdamike,3,Mon Jul 13 17:28:41 2015 UTC,Dylan Bruce mentioned it during the Nerdist panel. It's his farewell tour because he's off to Heroes Reborn now.
orphanblack,3d57fk,DetectiveMiles,3,Mon Jul 13 19:16:06 2015 UTC,It could be that he loves the fans and co-stars and wants to be around. No conspiracy necessary.
orphanblack,3d57fk,philboy37,2,Tue Jul 14 03:24:02 2015 UTC,And like characters who are killed off in GOT still do RP after they are off the show- people still like them & miss them :-(
orphanblack,3d34xd,whosdamike,6,Mon Jul 13 03:39:31 2015 UTC,"Silver is John Fawcett, just above is Maria Kennedy (Mrs. S), bottom one is Kristian Bruun (Donnie).  John signed it when I rushed up to the stage at the end. I couldn't quite reach but the other fans were super cool about it and passed the book up to get signed. Couldn't catch Graeme, sadly.  I was leaving the venue when my friend texted me and told me the cast was just chilling with fans around the art section. I turned around and booked it down the stairs, then kind of shoved it at them. Managed to catch Kristian and Maria that way.  Hope there's an opportunity next year to catch Graemme and Tatiana, would also love to get some other cast members to sign it. But so happy that I got any autographs on it at all.  I'm planning on going back through the episodes that showed pages and trying to make the inside look the same.  And yes, I know the book cover isn't like the one they have on the show... I picked the edition that looked most similar out of what I could find online. Someone in another thread here suggested the TV version is a custom prop and that seems right."
orphanblack,3d34xd,zixkill,3,Mon Jul 13 03:43:40 2015 UTC,I was gonna say your book is too badass to sass! Your friend is right-you have chosen....wisely.   I bet if you found someone to take it to the set for you they'd all sign it. ALL OF THEM!!!

orphanblack,3d8pgf,unnatural_rights,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:11:01 2015 UTC,"A ""wigger"" is a ""white _________"", meaning someone who is white, but simply acts ghetto and follows that lifestyle.

orphanblack,3czk6g,portlanddahl,17,Sun Jul 12 05:19:08 2015 UTC,I think she's very sharp. And that none of the clones are good actors. I'd rate Sarah as a passable impostor.
orphanblack,3czk6g,sadcatpanda,9,Sun Jul 12 06:55:03 2015 UTC,"Kira tells Cal that she can tell them apart, so I would assume she can tell the non-sarah clones apart too.  Idk that it needs to be a superpower though, kids are more open minded...S realizes Alison impersonated Sarah as soon as she meets Alison as Alison...but she might not have been able to have the frame of mind at the time to consider that someone identical to Sarah might exist."
orphanblack,3czk6g,Tziporahh,4,Sun Jul 12 07:13:22 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it's been hinted a couple of times that she has super senses. When she and Cal were camping in the RV, she could tell that a forest ranger was approaching to check up on them. Also, when she got captured by Dyad, she could tell that Sarah was looking at her through the one-way mirror in her room."
orphanblack,3czk6g,shampoo_samurai,3,Sun Jul 12 15:52:59 2015 UTC,Shit. You're right...
orphanblack,3czk6g,sadcatpanda,2,Sun Jul 12 23:13:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah she's extremely clever. Sarah says Kira gets her good intuition from Cal.  Kira's been shown to be able to tell when people are approaching (she does it a couple times with Cal).. and has some sort of connection to the clones. Like with Helena in the first season, she kind of knew she was at the front door even though she wasn't visible. And I don't think it's a coincidence that Kira was the one waking Cosima up when she was having her near death experience. I feel like she kind of knew she had to give him Duncan's book.  I hope they explore it in the next season. Hoping to see more of Cal as well."
orphanblack,3czk6g,zixkill,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:16:21 2015 UTC,Kira also knew Helena wouldn't eat her when everyone else thought otherwise. I wouldn't say she's superpowered but I've been reading Xmen for so long that you'd have to be damned impressive to have a 'superpower' for me ;)
orphanblack,3czk6g,BlackHawk30,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:32:22 2015 UTC,She got run the frick over in season 1 and survived with minor injuries. I'm pretty sure she got hit so hard by that car I think she bounced when she hit the road.
orphanblack,3czk6g,SlothyTheSloth,6,Tue Jul 14 07:08:52 2015 UTC,I've always wondered if she has some sort of hidden super power that has yet to fully show itself

orphanblack,3czk6g,Biomirth,5,Sun Jul 12 18:18:13 2015 UTC,"It was hinted at. I think the rest of it is just her being very perceptive.  Kids often have an open mind so if they see someone who looks like mummy but is acting different they may think imposter, while an adult would think, why are you acting weird are you on drugs? :)"
orphanblack,3czk6g,charenton_,5,Sun Jul 12 11:54:17 2015 UTC,"They've kept it a mystery, somewhere right on the line between: ""Naaaa, that's crazy, Kira's normal"" and ""Oh definitely, there's something superpowered with Kira""."
orphanblack,3czk6g,zixkill,5,Sun Jul 12 13:33:49 2015 UTC,"Not a dream! When she gets hit by the car (S01E08/09, I think?), she heals so fast that the doctor is shocked by it.  That was the point at which I thought, wait... does she grow up to be Claire from Heroes?"
orphanblack,3czk6g,ConorGames,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:12:20 2015 UTC,"I rewatched that episode recently and was still completely shocked at how hard and fast Kira was hit by the car. She basically walked away, and even a spongey-boned kid wouldn't walk away from that."

orphanblack,3cvm4u,Cicatrix21,10,Sat Jul 11 03:41:44 2015 UTC,"I thought that line was kind of silly, to be honest.   ""It was never Beth I loved""?  That sounds like he knew Sarah the entire time he knew Beth. If he had said ""I never truly loved Beth, but I did come to love you."" it would have been more realistic. I mean, yeah Sarah rocked his world when she stepped into Beth's life, but Paul was clearly taken with Sarah's bravery and he started to show concern for her as time went on.  Maybe Beth was distant because she knew how Art felt about her. Maybe she sort of felt the same way about him and that just made things more awkward at Casa Dierden. Maybe we'll find out next season, maybe we won't. But that was my one gripe with that line."

orphanblack,3cvm4u,tranypanda,6,Mon Jul 13 01:04:41 2015 UTC,"I think he did love her, but that was the job. He loved who she was but there was not much else driving him to be with her aside from his job to monitor her. They implied they were really happy but things started to go south in the relationship. And we can assume it went south when Beth found out about everything and after she killed the prolethean. When Beth killed herself and Sarah took over he was still there thinking it was Beth but Sarah gave an edge back to who he thought Beth was, maybe it was similar to how Beth was before everything started affecting her and it brought back his love for her, when he found out that during that time it was in fact Sarah he realised it was that edge that he loved.   He loved Beth and Sarah refreshed that and in the end because Beth was dead he could only see Sarah. But honestly I think Paul, like Delphine loved all the clones even if only really could show it to Sarah and Beth.   /my two cents."

I made up all kinds of stories with a smile on my face (or voice on the phone) to put together scraps of the information and finally located her, and extended family.

It looked to me like the shapes that Duncan drew on the pages told Rachel a pattern to draw on the page that highlighted letters to make the message.  There is probably a lot more info in the book so at some point maybe they'll come back to it and explain it better.

Then after the initial post and comment others users started calling Hendricks a troll and mischaracterized his screenplay.  All that was provided was a link to Hendricks website where he has posted his screenplay that the Orphan Black people requested and passed on.  The idea was for people to read the screenplay for themselves for them to make up their own minds and not have OB reddit users make up their minds for them.  You are protesting this all too much.

orphanblack,3c5qjo,Hawkguy67,2,Sun Jul 5 01:52:15 2015 UTC,I doubt that would be the premise. Mostly because you can't really cure any disease that way.   The overpopulation theory is much more plausible. Although why the military would care about that is the hole in that.   I wonder how the writers are going to tie all this in with neolution.
orphanblack,3c5qjo,neshynesh,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:21:33 2015 UTC,"The military could have funded the project because it's a highly illegal experiment on both the sterilization of others and the cloning of a human being to begin with, and they could keep it top secret.   As I mentioned, it's completely possible Project Castor was continuing this good work. The fact that some of the clones seem a little crazy might just be to throw us off and make it seem as if they're intentionally raping women and collecting hair samples for no reason.  I think the overpopulation theory is the most probable (over sterilizing certain people to prevent them from spreading a certain disease through procreation) but the hair samples and logs from Project Castor have to be for something. Either the military is using it for secret warfare (which seems too obvious at this point) or they are testing for genetic markers."
orphanblack,3c5qjo,shampoo_samurai,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:35:31 2015 UTC,"Both Castor and Leda are being used to further Neolution's agenda. Most likely, the isolated pathogen is going to be used to sterilize entire cities, preventing regular people from birthing normal offspring. At present, the pathogen kills its subjects, but once isolated, they can potentially make a benign version that just renders the subject infertile.   On the other hand, the cloning process and genetic modification can be used to ensure that the next generation of humanity are all genetically-superior beings. This can be achieved by forcing people who were sterilized with the pathogen to raise clones of genetically-superior people, or by offering them to receive IVF treatment to have a child, but needing the embryo to be genetically-modified. Doing this, pretty much every child in the world born in the next few years will be sort of super-human like Kira."
orphanblack,3c5qjo,shampoo_samurai,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:49:12 2015 UTC,"Do you think that falls in line with the Leda mythology theory then? Creating superior humans (half mortal and half divine in mythology, but not a literal translation) in the cloning of humans? If whoever's running the show sees himself as a ""savior"" (Zeus) of humanity, and Kendall Malone was the Leda in this story, he could be trying to achieve self-directed evolution (hence Neolution).  I know we don't have all the pieces yet, but it seems possible that either the original plan was to help with overpopulation (possibly even riding the world of a disease in the process), or the plan was hijacked after it was compartmentalized."

orphanblack,3c3lkr,Hawkguy67,4,Sat Jul 4 21:28:54 2015 UTC,"I actually covered the Greek Mythology aspect and how the show's characters relate here.  The way I see it, the person who ran Project LEDA at the start is the one in charge of Neolution so many years later. Of course this is just my theory, but here's how I justify it:  He creates Project LEDA, which in mythology results in Helen being born (half mortal/half divine). Maybe he sees this as the next step in human evolution: Self-directed evolution. We've already seen it in certain people (the tail, the worm, Rachel's eye). Perhaps what he wants is the pure Helen (Sarah/Helena) who has the ability to procreate.  This would make it simpler for him to get to Susan Duncan and corrupt her and use her to achieve his goals by promising her Rachel.  The military might have used the male clone line to target people deemed unfit to continue breeding (hence the Castor sterility effect) which would make way for the new wave of human evolution to triumph."
orphanblack,3c3lkr,Hawkguy67,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:52:13 2015 UTC,"Some of that makes sense, others I still feel we are still trying to get a square peg into a round hole. I suppose what concerns me is Leda is a moral in the myth. Nothing special other than been a queen. Leda produces special kids. The current Leda clones were designed barren and are sisters to Castor who in the myth are Leda's sons. The one thing that I have noticed lot in the seasons is the number three, Cosmia has three as her lead sequence number. Let's hop briefly down the rabbit hole. Let's assume there are clones who are series 1 & 2, the Neolutilns have them, three is DYAD and four is military. It's a long shot, who knows.   The corruption of Susan Duncan is the huge storyline next season, how it happened, the other scientists involved, who really died in the fire. It's six I think and why wait so long to reconnect with Rachel. What did Neolution offer that Susan needed?  With the military The virus was unknown, the Doctor tells Paul this during lunch, he mentions that Rudy had brought back a very sick girl and that's how the military became aware of the virus. It was been studied by Dr Coady. It makes me wonder who carried the male babies and where. Clearly not IVF like the Leda's so how many women are involved and were they infected by the Castor's?  So many questions and possible theories, I love Orphan Black."
orphanblack,3c3lkr,redditRW,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:44:13 2015 UTC,"Well I've got another post up that explores the idea that the entire purpose of Project LEDA was to solve the overpopulation crisis and possibly cure mankind of a certain disease.

orphanblack,3byicv,con_nguoi,3,Tue Jul 7 05:09:46 2015 UTC,It's assumed Cosima has always had a monitor in the way Dr Leekie speaks about Cosima. How she's always been watched and finally let her in on the whole clone thing because they know how competent she is.
orphanblack,3byicv,MamasPajas,2,Tue Jul 7 07:28:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with con_nguoi, I feel like it's heavily implied that all of the clones consistently had monitors except for Sarah and Helena.

orphanblack,3bw0at,ymcameron,12,Thu Jul 2 16:40:10 2015 UTC,"We've met 5 Castors so far (Seth, Rudy, Mark, Miller and Parsons).  When Coady told Helena that the boy clones were like her children she said, ""I never wanted children but I ended up with more than I could count.""  I think it's safe to assume that there will be more Castor clones next season.  It's hard to believe that there aren't more groups of clones somewhere.  They are probably spread around in small groups so that people don't freak out.  If you see 2 or 3 guys who look  alike you can explain it as brothers.  If there are a couple dozen in one place it would be a bit harder to explain."
orphanblack,3bw0at,pennysquisher,3,Thu Jul 2 17:51:30 2015 UTC,"I suspect ""spread around"" is the key to Castor. There may be a neolutionist plot to sterilize the population (like in the BBC series Utopia) via the Castor defect. Spreading the Castors I the best way to accomplish this."
orphanblack,3bw0at,zehn78,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:41:34 2015 UTC,"This was kind of my issue with the Castor plot this season. I also watched (and loved) Utopia, so I felt like the story had been done. I can absolutely understand that the writers hadn't seen it, but it just didn't wow me, and I'm assuming it wasn't that thrilling for others either.  OB is strongest when it focuses on the struggles and triumphs of the Leda sisters. The idea of boy clones is interesting, but I'd rather the story focus on the sisters."
orphanblack,3bw0at,Protanope,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:26:26 2015 UTC,Maybe global population control is going to be the new zombie plot. Something that everyone uses.
orphanblack,3bw0at,zehn78,15,Sun Jul 5 22:36:34 2015 UTC,"I might be wrong, but i thought it was implied that there used to be more Castor clones but they ended up dying from the defect? That's why the remaining ones were so fixated on finding the original genome, so they could try and cure themselves. That's also why the one Castor, Parsons, volunteered to let them study his brain while he was still alive - because he'd seen what the defect did to other Castor clones and knew he wouldn't survive anyway."
orphanblack,3bw0at,snideways,5,Thu Jul 2 17:09:36 2015 UTC,"Agree with this. There could be more, but they mde it look like we were seeing the few remaining survivors."
orphanblack,3bw0at,zehn78,3,Thu Jul 2 19:02:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah but if the Castors all lived together (as several of them have talked about, being raised in the same room/base/whatever) there couldn't have possibly been as many as Leda (where entire self aware groups have been destroyed i.e Helsinki). At max there might've been 30-50 Castors and there were probably 10 Leda clones at Helsinki (I'm assuming it was a larger group as the characters make it seem like a massacre) and new ones are popping up all over the fucking place all the time as the plot demands (sick clone video diary, Krystal, the unknowns in Europe, ect) and if in one area there can be 3-4 imagine how many clusters are in different parts of the world (primarily Caucasian countries like France, Sweden, maybe even Mexico as TM's heritage could be hispanic-passing). It could be a plot point later on that Dyad took it too far and made way too many Leda girls with the information they were given as opposed to the army who only made as many Castors as they could effectively control at a time (especially since the Castors were raised self-aware and revolt meant they'd have no choice but to terminate the entire project which means millions, maybe billions in losses. Leda girls are unaware and evenly distributed they could theoretically place them wherever they wanted in however many numbers. They'd only be limited in how much money they have in the budget to pay for monitors and tests but if they can clone human life odds are they have an unlimited budget)."
orphanblack,3bw0at,quentintarrantino,4,Thu Jul 2 21:37:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a good point too. I think they said there were six Helsinki clones so yeah, either way there would probably be a ton more Leda clones than Castor clones."
orphanblack,3bw0at,snideways,2,Thu Jul 2 23:17:02 2015 UTC,"It could be nothing, but one of the photos of the little boys on Dr. Coady's desk (season 3 scene) is of four little boys in a row ... that could mean only the ones we met (Mark, Rudy, Seth and Miller) were actually raised by Coady. Maybe they found Parsons somewhere else - that one has never made sense to me."
orphanblack,3bw0at,envie42,2,Fri Jul 3 03:56:52 2015 UTC,"There could still be like, dozens of different Castor military bases around the world that we don't even know about. We only know about that one in Mexico."
orphanblack,3bw0at,Protanope,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:28:10 2015 UTC,A good point but why wouldn't the Castor boys know about them? They were raised self-aware and taught that they were part of something bigger than themselves and that their identity was shared. There was nothing to be gained from not telling them that they had other brothers elsewhere.   PS: I think the Castor boys are limited in where they could be because they are a military program. They needed to be raised and trained in large groups which puts them at a disadvantage as Leda girls are singular and very easy to slip into locations. A unit of Castors is much different than the equivalent of Leda spread out over a country like Spain as they require no specialized training other than monitors.
orphanblack,3bw0at,quentintarrantino,3,Sun Jul 5 12:16:05 2015 UTC,"I saw this in another comment a while back, someone mentioned that they thought even though the male clones were self aware, they were raised in ""units"".... so the unit we saw this season is only one of possibly many more.  That makes sense to me."
orphanblack,3bw0at,Aneak,2,Thu Jul 2 23:57:04 2015 UTC,"The CAstor clones are in the miltary, and we've only been introduced to 1 unit (plus brief mention of Sammys unit which MArk belonged too)  To introduce all the othe castor clones we would need to see all the other units, not much point in that, though hopefully next year we see a bit more about Sammy's unit."

orphanblack,3bxjiz,godlessprophet,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:24:36 2015 UTC,As much as I expected Donnie to tell Alison... It makes sense that he hasn't. It doesn't seem like he's told her about pouchy either. My guess is that he's waiting until after the election and the bubbles dinner to tell her.
orphanblack,3bxjiz,Tziporahh,3,Fri Jul 3 17:52:13 2015 UTC,"Delphine and Cosima confront the (hidden) Neolutionists as they (metaphorically) slay their way through corporate hell (with science) in order to produce a treatment (not cure) for Cosima. Scott, Art, and a re-cast James Frain-as-their-lawyer join them for team Cophine. Delphine still does pokey-pokey mean things to Rachel's eye and Cosima has to rein in Delphine. They make mad science together to get over it ;)  Shay(dee) is Art's girlfriend, and a spy for Castor. Sarah has to confront Art about Shay's past (intelligence provided by Paul, acting as triple agent) and Art goes mental, finally breaking down and telling Sarah he's in love with her. Sarah corrects him and they discover he's still in love with Beth (obvs.!).  Art's kids play with Alison's kids all the time, still without a drinks trolley present.  Helena recruits Jessie Towing to kidnap Crystal for Castor, because she's again been duped into batting for the wrong team. Donnie and Alison rescue them by hiring a drug cartel to intercept a prisoner transport....or something.  Helena kills Shay. Jessie leaves Helena. (sorry, she's more interesting solo).  And etc..  Mainly, I thought the season was the weakest yet (still great, but just not as great as it could/should have been) and that the directing was pretty inconsistent. The idea of the Castor project was good but the execution was pretty blase. But we did get Pupok, so that's a plus.  The 'original' was pretty underwhelming, but the Neolutionists-surprise!-larvae! was quite an interesting development. Alison's mother was stupid, as was her ex-boyfriend-cum-drug-dealer. Would have preferred Ramone 10x, but then again we did get the ""we'll need 2 baby ox then"" scene.  Gracie being the mole was also a good idea executed poorly. There was never a sense of Castor's struggle and of Gracie's tribulations, even though that's all that happened with both parties on screen. But we did get the Gracie-as-club-barbie model, so that's a plus.  7/10 stories seemed to have these difficulties being well integrated and part of a larger story. Earlier seasons were much better about weaving each story into the others for a complete tapestry, and for me this shows a lack of completion on the writer's part. They had some great ideas but never had the evil genius pulling them all together (I blame Graeme, because, head writer).  I don't think it's at all difficult to come up with a better overall season plot-progression than the one we had as executed. I'm slightly disappointed, but not surprised. I don't feel they had the initial vision lasting beyond 2 seasons and are now in unknown territory."
orphanblack,3bxjiz,Biomirth,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:07:56 2015 UTC,"I would've had Alison interact more with the characters involved with the central plot, because she just felt so cut off from everything for a lot of the season. The Castor storyline wasn't bad, and I like Ari Millen, but it wasn't that great, either. Also, I wouldn't have left Delphine's fate in the balance, because that cliffhanger has been used for every season so far. Season 1 - Helena, season 2 - Rachel (although we knew she was going to be alive before season 3 started, it wasn't immediately confirmed) and now Delphine for season 3. They probably did it because they don't know whether or not Evelyne Brochu will be available for season 4, so I guess I can understand why they did it, but still, it's been used before."

orphanblack,3bsg0u,redjello,6,Wed Jul 1 19:49:43 2015 UTC,"It could be. However, ""host-parasite"" can be considered pretty broad spectrum for immunology and technically can be applied to most pathogens including some bacteria and viruses. That being said, given her medical degree we can assume that parasite refers to an actual eukaryote. If the thing Nealon was trying to spit into her mouth was either going to kill her or turn her into a stepford wife style Neolutionist it would be a fitting (and evil) move in-line with her field of study.   The first thing that popped to my mind with the ""worm"" was actually that it reminded me of botfly larva, which do develop within a mammalian host. if you're into gross insects...

orphanblack,3bsg0u,mhazzie24,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:24:43 2015 UTC,The first thing I thought of with the larvae was a parasite. Since host/parasite relationships are Delphine's specialty ... she would have been able to study it and figure out what was going on. Her own research used against her?

orphanblack,3bom4d,resurrexia,3,Wed Jul 1 00:14:51 2015 UTC,"I think Delphine is alive - multiple interviews with the writers have come out and every single one says different things. It's a TV drama... And if they didn't keep Delphine's life hanging in the balance then there wouldn't be a cliffhanger leading into season 4.   I believe there will be a total of five seasons from what I've read, so if that is true, then there is plenty of room for Delphine. The neolutionists clearly want Delphine for some reason otherwise Nealon never would have offered her a job - I'm pretty sure she's either faked her own death or been taken by the neolutionists for some purpose... She would actually be a good pawn to put in place as leader of Dyad but under mind control. Well, whatever that worm was, Delphine will either study it as she specialised in host-parasite relationships (they made a massive deal of Delphine's scientific background in previous seasons) or Neolutionists could implant her with a worm in order to control her running of Dyad. Who knows! But for me, if she was going to die, they would have done it in the finale. Delphine's got too much to give to the OB plot to let her die - just wait for season 4, she may not appear till later in the season, but I trust she'll be there at some point :) (cophine is endgame)"
orphanblack,3bom4d,delphinecosendgame,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:09:55 2015 UTC,"I hope you're right! I think the plan is 5 seasons, but that's dependent on renewal (which I think they should be able to get for S5 as it's been publicized that the creators are planning on 5, so in an ideal world even if S4 has low ratings it'll most likely get greenlit...there are exceptions though #RIPHannibal).   My comment about time was more of a backhand towards some of the more frivolous elements of S3 (looking at you Hendrixes, as fun as you were), and that with 20 total episodes left they need to be a little more streamlined. I do agree Delphine adds a lot to the overall story line though, especially this past season, so hopefully they work out the scheduling and are able to bring her back."
orphanblack,3bom4d,envie42,2,Wed Jul 1 13:23:17 2015 UTC,"I'm a rather new addition to the clone-fan-club having just marathon binged the entirety of three seasons on Amazon Prime for my summer watching since everything else I like is off-season right now. (Love it btw) ... and one of the first things I thought of was this, renewal of the season and what is important for key plots. Delphine seems to play a very heavy role in tying together everything within Dyad/Neolution so I really do not think she's dead. I think they may even try to fake her death to get her off the radar which could lead to Cosima coming back to Dyad and trying to find her - great new material there. Her career focus (immunology and host/parasite stuff) is also key and something I commented on in another thread. They put that in there for a reason I think - and she's a specialist who would know wtf that worm was all about.   Edit: I did notice right away she was shot in the mid/lower right torso area. That's not usually associated with fatal shots if it missed her main organs and she doesn't bleed out. If they take her back inside to their trauma teams they have on hand 24/7 then I think medically she's got good chances.  I think she will be back. :)"

It seems to be mostly about harvesting clones for their organs, which has never been brought up on OB.  Most of the clones are men, and the one female clone appears to be a one-off with no sisters.

orphanblack,3bj597,redjello,6,Wed Jul 1 18:56:16 2015 UTC,"We've discussed all of this in other threads, and the other passing-the-buck thing I have to suggest is to re-watch the whole series. I saw the first season probably 6 times with different people and there's almost always something new to pick up each time.  That said, I can try to answer some of your questions:   Much of this we don't know per se because characters don't explain themselves directly very often and also everyone lies.    So to start of what the hell did DYAD want? Did they want to cure Leta?   Dyad are a biotech company in general, so they're working on tons of projects, one of which is a secret human cloning project named Leda. The purpose of the project isn't explicitly stated other than by professor Duncan who states that the Leda clones were ""proof of concept"", meaning that the entire project was essentially research to lay the groundwork for any number of things. But then again, Duncan was either lying or didn't know his wife was alive and had different intentions from the beginning.  And that said, we don't know what the current Dyad was up to with regards to Leda. There are huge biotech $profits$ to be made by developing things like cloning ahead of everyone else. Cloned organs, genetic research, myriad other things could come out of such a project. By being the only company with living clones they're investing in a monopoly on any or all of that.  And that's where Topside comes in. Topside are a cabal of people running the world, essentially. They're essentially the owners of Dyad and you can think of them as carrying the ultimate agenda if there is one that Dyad itself isn't aware of.  The Johanssens are the ""farming Prolethians"". They're a Cult who see cloning as some sort of religious sign of a new era. Unlike the ""other Prolethians"" who saw clones as abominations of God's will. The Johanssens wanted to achieve the exultation of Mr. Cult Leader by making babies for him, including clone babies. Helena didn't think that was a good plan and burned down the fish people's ranch.  Mark was ostensibly at the farm to spy on the Prolethians for project Castor. M-Art-cus was at the ranch because he's smitten with dead-Beth and is therefore highly invested in Sarah-and-co. The Johannsens are the only people he knows with a connection to the Maggie-Chen murder mystery, etc..  The Neolutionists are a secret organization of science-as-savior nutters who overtly just want ""Self-directed evolution"", but who secretly want all the clone goodies for themselves, likely for ideological reasons more than simply power.  But you can interpret much of this differently as most of this info is from inference rather than evidence."
orphanblack,3bj597,Biomirth,3,Mon Jun 29 20:19:13 2015 UTC,"Biomirth: This is a great reply! I second the suggestion to watch it a few more times. There many times that a conversation or an event happens that you don't realize the weight of until much later in the series.   I would add to this wonderful explanation just another point about Topside. Last episode of season 2, Marion Bowles (the woman at the mansion who has a young Leda daughter) explains the purpose as essentially thus: They believe advances in biotech and guided evolution are inevitable, so they want to own it to make sure a)it goes in the direction they see fit, and b)they make money.   Now, when Marion says this, Sarah and the audience are under the impression that she, Marion, and Topside, by extension, are more or less ""good"" guys. Their intention don't seem pure evil, and Dyad only became so, supposedly, because it was co-opted by extremists and got ""out of their hands,"" so to speak. Whether or not their benevolence is TRUE, however, is up for speculation. For example, in ""Certain Agony on the Battlefield"" (Season 3, episode 6), when Paul discovers that Dr. Coady (aka ""Mom"") is weaponizing the Castor infertility disease, Paul asks Coady ""WHO ARE YOU DOING THIS FOR?!?!"" and she remains silent.   So, who was/is the force behind this plot? Topside? Someone bigger? Neolution? We don't know. But that gives a little better idea of all the plots that Topside could possibly have their hands in, and the deep mystery of it all.   Good luck unraveling it all, and have fun!   Edit: words. broke up wall of text."

Well yeah, you can't have a monopol in cloning if all your clones are dead.   What is Topside and what do they want? Are DYAD and Topside in an alliance in any way?   It's something like the mother company of DYAD. They steer DYAD or at least the part of DYAD that is responsible for the clones.   What did the Johanssens family want to achieve in their farm?   They are just some crazy religious people. The father (forgot his name) used to be Dr Duncans assistant. They think that Helena being pregnant is some sort of act of god.   Are Neulutionists and DYAD the same thing, if not what is their goal?   No, Neulutionists are some kind of sect? (secret organization?) that have infaltrated DYAD, Topside and probably also the military. We don't know their goal yet.  Also check out this post. Might help.  EDIT: Typos."

They were discussing Mark's history (or the version he told the prolethians) and how he was forced to do unpleasant things from a young age: 19. Everything we know would suggest Castor and Leda are the same age.

orphanblack,3bfn6j,kimberlymakescoffee,2,Mon Jun 29 02:04:55 2015 UTC,I would never say never with this show.  There no reason Bob couldn't return.  And it's clear that the show runners have on occasion pandered a bit to the fans so if they were wondering...

orphanblack,3bduy1,tamilda,13,Sun Jun 28 07:49:49 2015 UTC,"I can't think of any other foreshadowing for Delphine's death, but it's possible that this was originally meant to indicate Cosima's death. Because there were other signs like Cosima standing in front of the word ""terminal"" after she first starts coughing blood. Maybe they were originally planning to kill her off but changed their minds, found an alternative source for tragedy :'("
orphanblack,3bduy1,haaaaaaveyoumetme,9,Sun Jun 28 16:54:18 2015 UTC,"Im pretty sure Delphine is alive. If they really wanted to kill her they would've said so just like they did with Paul. Or they would've shown her dead like they did with Leekie or Daniel etc.   In interviews gm keeps saying 'well, there's a crack of hope that she'll be back'. Or w/e ...  Even if they tease her as dead now, she still isn't, because the fact that we didn't see her die means she's only dead until the writers change their minds. TV shows can never seem to resist bringing back characters that might not be dead."
orphanblack,3bduy1,Tziporahh,2,Sun Jun 28 18:52:16 2015 UTC,"I think they left it ambiguous based on the actress' schedule. I doubt she's coming back cause Evelyne's show, Company X, got renewed."

The way they marketed made it sound more ""exciting"" but it really is more of a human drama with a WWII backdrop/context (but...barely to me...like I have a poor sense of which part of the war in terms of timeline are they involved in right now in the show...etc.)  I am wondering why BBC America didn't lock EBro down as Delphine..now there's this conflict of schedule that we are assuming is the case with CBC's XCompany (that's probably shooting till the end of October, S2 starting in Jan 2016)). Plus she might be  promoting the Tobey Maguire film this Fall ""Pawn Sacrifice"" ....maybe. So I can see her schedule being packed till Jan 2016. She just wrapped up another film, Miséracorde (Mercy), and this will probably be out in 2016. ...even with this busy schedule...I can't help but shake the idea that smthn else has happened.

orphanblack,3bcqu9,ThaBenMan,9,Sun Jun 28 17:59:11 2015 UTC,"I doubt it's true but I also thought of that as a possible explanation, especially when I realised the time line of the show. It's been like 3 months and already Paul and Delphine were willing to die for them. And we know they were genetically modified. But I doubt the writers would go that way because it would make those relationships feel less genuine."
orphanblack,3bcqu9,haaaaaaveyoumetme,4,Sun Jun 28 01:00:31 2015 UTC,Don't think the pheromones thing is sound. Regarding Paul and Delphine willing to die for their beloved clones; they're both in shady corporations (Paul - castor and Delphine working for dyad). So they both know the dangers of their jobs and death is within that scope. I think that's also why they haven't killed off a regular civilian lover like Cal.  If you know what I mean. Not sure if I'm making sense.
orphanblack,3bcqu9,con_nguoi,3,Sun Jun 28 09:40:37 2015 UTC,"The short timeline was another thing that made me curious the more I thought; Paul's line to Sarah about her being the one he loved over Beth is what sparked the thought. They basically slept together and she had him hooked. Same with Delphine, who before Cosima stated she had never considered bisexuality.  I know the real reason is relationships spice up the plot, but the subtle implication is fun to consider."
orphanblack,3bcqu9,3000milestoSpacejam,6,Sun Jun 28 01:19:11 2015 UTC,"Also, Sarah had Vic pining for her bad too.  Allison had Jason still trying to rekindle stuff in addition to Donnie loving her obviously.  Jesse drove out to meet Helena after they only met once.  You have an interesting theory. Depending on how fantastical this show actually is, there could be an explanation there as well."
orphanblack,3bcqu9,haaaaaaveyoumetme,3,Sun Jun 28 16:01:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Also, Art fell for Beth as well as Rachel and Ferdinand's thing.  Oh! And Cos's monitor/gf before Delphine...I won't spoil it for folks who haven't read the comic, but yeah, she was relentless and refused to allow Leekie to assign Delphine to Cos. It didn't end well."
orphanblack,3bcqu9,theworkbox,3,Sun Jun 28 16:17:09 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree. And there's Cal and shay as well. Cal spent a month with Sarah and is apparently still in love 8 years later. Shay (assuming she's not a spy or anything) has known Cosima for like 3 weeks maybe? and seems willing to put up with a lot of crap. The only example that doesn't follow the rule is that Paul was with Beth a long time and never loved her.
orphanblack,3bcqu9,ClankersGonnaClank,2,Sun Jun 28 02:35:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe it wears off after prolongued exposure! Donnie also doesn't seem as dramatically in love with his clone as the others are/were. Felix was also immediately smitten with Tony. Testosterone would affect the pheromones. Although , hm, then Paul should be immune....although they were apart for a while, no?"
orphanblack,3bcqu9,haaaaaaveyoumetme,2,Tue Jun 30 11:40:36 2015 UTC,Is there a good resource for looking at the timeline of the show? I hadn't realized it was so short.
orphanblack,3bcqu9,ca1cifer,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:24:45 2015 UTC,"In this interview they say it's been a few months, but it's better to just think of it as the magic of 'TV time': http://www.etonline.com/tv/163030_orphan_black_postmortem_scorpion_psychosis_mystery_elevator_clone_more_answers_revealed/ Trying to work out an exact timeline is difficult because there are some inconsistencies, but they've only gone through late Autumn and Winter so it can't be more than a few months."
orphanblack,3bcqu9,3000milestoSpacejam,6,Sun Jun 28 16:36:29 2015 UTC,"Quite honestly, I think I can easily fall head over heels for either Cosima or Sarah. Though I can see where you're coming from too. Delphine and Paul both seem to have fallen in love way too fast. With that being said, I still don't think it's pheromones or something because Paul didn't fall for Beth nor did any of Krystal's monitors fall for her."

orphanblack,3bcqu9,regandlmz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:24:39 2015 UTC,"Interesting concept and definitely reminds me of Dark Angel, but I would argue that that's not the case. It just seems like in this show that there aren't any actual modifications made to the clones just that they are clones.   They're not necessarily stronger or smarter or more attractive than other people. Unlike in Dark Angel where that was a big part of the show. It just seems to me that in the science of the show they weren't trying to make advanced clones, so much as just trying to make clones period. It just seems like they were the first step of can we actually pull this off, after which trying to create certain things with the cloning process would have happened."

He said on the podcast that the time line for all of this is about two months? He said it shows you how crazy things have happened in all of the lives of the clones. So if thats what the actors are being told, I'm going to believe that is the time line."
orphanblack,3b5ivx,Cliffschetti,3,Fri Jun 26 03:37:48 2015 UTC,ok thanks! Just so many relationships have been formed and fallen apart and formed again that it seems like too short a period for all of that to happen.

orphanblack,3b5ivx,Runscottie,2,Sun Jun 28 14:14:35 2015 UTC,"I know that Kristian Brunn (Donny Hendrix) has been on the podcasts saying its only 2-3 months but I think that's just his opinion. I don't think we should take that as official orphan black stance.  Why? I agree the seasons bookend each other immediately. No gaps between seasons. But during the seasons themselves a lot happens. For example, Alison in season 2 has to rehearse for a play as well as attend rehab. Thats like 2-3 months of time right there.   Sara runs off multiple times to far off locations. Okay, just getting to Mexico and hunting down Helena must have taken weeks.   And finally, the biggest indicator to me is the season changes. Definitely through the course of the series we see weather go from snow on the ground, to warmer weather, back to snow on the ground in this past season. I'd say we're talking at least a year if not more since beginning of season 1."
orphanblack,3b5ivx,Runscottie,2,Fri Jun 26 14:55:03 2015 UTC,"Forgot to mention: Allison campaigns! I mean the beginning of season 3 Marci cotes seems at the start of her campaign, coming over to Allison for support. Then Allison launches her own campaign. Even if someone was rush campaigning were talking like 2-3 months at minimum. I mean you can maaaaaaybe  justify Allison rushing in, but Marci cotes I'm sure would have gotten a nice head start.  I'd love for us fans to put together like a rough time line or something by putting our heads together. Might be cool!"

Besides, writers have no sense of time."
orphanblack,3b5ivx,overitatoverit,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:44:32 2015 UTC,"I've gotta disagree with you on this and the post below. You are making a lot of assumptions.   A play and rehab being 2-3 months? Not sure about the play, but she was only in rehab for 2 weeks at the most. I think only 1 week. It was community theater for bored middle-class moms. Could have easily been rehearsed in 2 weeks.  I'm not sure what you're referring to in terms of weather. It's been snowy and cold the whole time except for the Mexico, and the last 5 or 6 episodes. It certainly hasn't gone back and forth, as though multiple seasons are passing. 2-3 months would cover end of winter, beginning of spring, which would account for some change in weather. (We also don't know where they are, so weather isn't a guaranteed indicator of anything.)  Again with the campaign, you're making an assumption. It's for a tiny position on a school board. 2-3 months at minimum? I was thinking more along the lines of a couple weeks. We know that from the time the signatures are handed in (with the whole $30,000 debacle) and the time the election results are in, is only a week. If it's a long-ish election, you don't have the candidates officially register and have the votes tallied within a week.  I think 2 months is pushing it, but 3-4 months makes sense to me."
orphanblack,3b5ivx,_maynard,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:10:25 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. I didn't listen to the podcast, but is it possible Kristian Bruun meant season 3 was 2-3 months? There's no way the entire show has been that short.  I think it's been 6 months at a minimum and close to a year on the high end. Looking at the change in seasons is one good indicator. Another is the fact that people are regularly getting beaten and have had time to heal completely. A black eye or split lip take a lot of time to clear up, and some characters have gone through the healing cycle more than once.  I want to do a rewatch and map out the timeline now."
orphanblack,3b5ivx,scrapplechic,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:29:16 2015 UTC,"The main thing that makes me think that the show's timeline is only a couple of months is Helena. She's been (supposedly) pregnant since season 2, right? But as of the end of season 3, I still don't see a baby bump. I believe it's usually around the 3rd or 4th month of pregnancy that the physical change becomes noticeable. So, either it really hasn't been that long between s2 and s3, or Helena may not actually be pregnant (or the show runners have goofed on that little detail.)"
orphanblack,3b5ivx,overitatoverit,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:26:35 2015 UTC,"Helena got pregnant in episode 9 of Season 2, and Coady says in the first episode of this season that she is ""2-3 weeks along."" IIRC, she is no more than 6 weeks along by the end of the season."

orphanblack,3b3ew1,BlitzAce71,13,Thu Jun 25 17:25:45 2015 UTC,"I would guess they only appeared to get everything they wanted.  We don't know what Ferdinand did with Coady.  She is probably in the Neolutionist's hands since whatever he did, it was before Delphine's confrontation with Dr. Nealon.    It appears Castor may be on the way out with Mark being the only Castor that we've met who is still alive but I will be amazed if there aren't more Castors to meet next season.  Nealon told Delphine that Leda and Castor are Neolution's Adam and Eve.  I could see them having a fertile, non-disease spreading Castor or two hidden somewhere that they are making more Kira style superbabies with.  It was never brought up at Dyad that anyone told Delphine or Nealon that Helena was pregnant but Coady definitely knows.  I'm glad that Helena got through the finale unscathed but I can't imagine that Neolution won't want her baby.  Neolution didn't know where the original DNA came from so there will definitely be further efforts next season to get hold of it, now that they know what they are looking for.  Kendall isn't exactly safe.  Not sure I agree that Susan being alive was predictable.  Leekie apparently didn't even know she was alive or he could have gotten himself out of trouble with Rachel by saying ""I didn't kill your mother""."
orphanblack,3b3ew1,pennysquisher,3,Thu Jun 25 17:55:35 2015 UTC,"Maybe Duncan being alive wasn't wildly predictable, but as soon as we saw the back of her head and heard her voice in 3.09 I knew it was her.  Which made the 3.10 reveal a little anticlimactic.  But before the second to last episode I hadn't thought about her being alive."

orphanblack,3b3ew1,bignatebig,6,Sat Jun 27 17:36:51 2015 UTC,"From my own perspective I really liked the finale. Nothing ever goes as planned on OB so the whole exchange with castor going as smoothly as it did surprised me and I was still anticipating some kind of twist. It was satisfying for things to work out for clone club for once.   I do also feel that season 3 felt a little stagnant though, and that's another reason why I liked the finale so much. I don't feel like all that much really happened and seeing so many events play out sequentially was gratifying.  I really grew on the castor boys but I think I was prepared for them not playing such a huge part from the start by where Ari Millen's name appeared in the opening. They hyped up the boy clones a lot though and I understand how it's disappointing."
orphanblack,3b3ew1,tearsinvegas,4,Sat Jun 27 18:07:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't get the Castor thing at all.  I understood it but didn't think it added anything to the story, as a result this felt like half a season of OB.  Some of those early episodes I'll probably not rewatch."
orphanblack,3b3ew1,BigRichFromWork,7,Thu Jun 25 20:20:33 2015 UTC,"Definitely a bit of a let down. Allison's story was never a central part of the show but this time around it was almost completely divorced from it. Not to mention how tired the whole ""soccer mom deals drugs"" concept has become (or the fact that in this context it didn't even make much sense). Cosima acted illogically all season, they even admitted to it in the season finale but it doesn't make things much better. The castor project as the main antagonist for half the season was a mistake, one of the selling points of this show, for me, was that the villain was in an ethical gray area, Castor with their torture and their indiscriminate civilian murders lacks subtlety.  To end on a positive note, it's still a good show and with the neolutionists they seem to get back on the right track for next season."
orphanblack,3b3ew1,EdiX,3,Thu Jun 25 21:57:06 2015 UTC,"I think over all it was a great season. Castor is dying off quick but it still seems really relevant to the neolusionist storyline they're setting up. There were some serious shifts in cast and this season had some of the most game changing episodes of the season. (3x06 anyone?) we actually got answers, idk I thought it was better than season 2."
orphanblack,3b3ew1,KingOfTheEverything,2,Thu Jun 25 18:41:35 2015 UTC,"I loved the new cast man. Also really loved Scott's bigger role, he's a bro."
orphanblack,3b3ew1,ConorGames,5,Fri Jun 26 04:51:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of your points. Season 3 was a bit of a scrambled mess and a let down.  A lot of the time they are just racing around like crazy people.  The production values are all over the place (the desert prison camp was like something out of 30 year old Doctor Who). This season did not have the stunning brilliance of season 1 but even with its flaws this is still one of the better shows on TV.  I really don't get the actor playing the Castor clones.  Its kind of unfair but compared to Tatiana he is just weak.  She is a totally different person for each clone and it's amazing where I have trouble telling his clones apart.  Her performance is jaw dropping and makes his performance look amateurish.  She routinely plays one clone pretending to be another so well that you totally buy it.  I dont think that could ever happen for the Castor clones.  But lets be honest.  This show is great because of stunning talent of Tatiana Maslany.  If it wasnt for her, I would not bother watching. A few of the other characters (Felix!) are very good but quite a few of the minor characters are just bad.  This show lacks the kind of depth that some of the big HBO shows get from their ensemble cast."

She routinely plays one clone pretending to be another so well that you totally buy it.  I dont think that could ever happen for the Castor clones.   To be fair to Ari Millen, there is a huge difference between the Ledas and Castors. The Leda girls were spread out all over the world, and raised by different families, and developed different character traits. The Castor boys were all raised together as soldiers, and thus the variety was more limited.  They were all going to have roughly the same appearance (haircuts, build, etc) and act like soldiers. I think the could have perhaps written some of the Castor parts in a way that made them more distinctive, but really, aside from Mark & Rudy they were Red Shirts."

He's such a good friend  When Sarah talk Helena down from sniping Rachel.  Helena saving Sarah in the bathroom  The twins working together to break Helena out of her cell...and then the complete heartbreak when Helena leaves Sarah.

orphanblack,3b030b,goldaline,2,Thu Jun 25 04:38:56 2015 UTC,"I've only sat down and read the first two issues so far - I have a big comics backlog and these aren't priority if that tells you anything. From what I recall, it mostly like, fills in back story. It shows bits of what we already know and fills in the details, shows more perspective, etc. Like, I believe the Helena issue showed what happened sort of right before she ran into Sarah for the first time. Not really necessary to know, but interesting if you really care about the characters.  I agree with the other commenter that the art isn't great; art is one of my favorite aspects of comics so that was kind of a let down. Personally, I don't love these comics, but I hesitate to ouright not recommend them because I know the main reason for that is that I'm reading it alongside other, more established comic books. Basically, if you normally enjoy comics, you might be let down because they don't hold up well outside of being about Orphan Black. (And the other comment is also right that $4 feels like a rip off when you can get way better books for $3) But lots of people I know have been enjoying them, including others on this sub.  If you're curious, the first three issues are $2 each on Comixology which I think is a fair price. Maybe pick up your favorite clone and read it to see if it's worth getting the rest.

orphanblack,3azex1,PrincessPoutine,2,Thu Jun 25 15:07:26 2015 UTC,You know what I really don't know. They might have a booth setup for exclusives specifically. Or they might be scattered at random booths that carry POP figures. Which there will be tons of. Just beware of flippers that price gouge if that's the case. I'm sure someone else here can answer that question for you though.
orphanblack,3azex1,ariesfire,3,Thu Jun 25 16:07:42 2015 UTC,SDCC is only allowing one pop per person to fend off scalpers. Don't know how they'll really enforce that (will they really remember your face?) But hopefully it helps keep them off eBay for ridiculous prices.
orphanblack,3azex1,PrincessPoutine,2,Fri Jun 26 09:45:25 2015 UTC,Good to know. Hmm are most of these gone during Preview night?

Later he has her money and is very slow to give it back. Sarah/Beth says its Pauls and that he will freak if he finds out but Art still takes his time.  In S3 we find out Art was in love with Beth. And those two moments in S1 now make perfect sense.   White neolition eyes. Now rachel gets a white eye.   Alison gives up drinking in S2, in S3 she has water in her wine glass at the dinner.  The paralells between Beth putting her bag down, and Delphine doing the same."
orphanblack,3awnuc,00Broobs00,3,Wed Jun 24 07:55:24 2015 UTC,I noticed the water in the wine glass in the dinner episode but completely did not match it up with her giving up drinking! My first thought was whether she could be pregnant - obviously your explanation makes so much more sense!
orphanblack,3awnuc,sestrasestra,10,Thu Jun 25 00:58:50 2015 UTC,Episode 5.  Donnie had been Alison's monitor for years.  Paul was Beth's for at least two years.  How is it that there's no evidence that Cosima had a monitor before Delphine?
orphanblack,3awnuc,ca1cifer,18,Wed Jun 24 04:48:30 2015 UTC,Cosima did have an old monitor but she broke up with her and moved to Minnesota for grad school. It's in the comics.

orphanblack,3awnuc,grumblepup,3,Wed Jun 24 14:49:51 2015 UTC,Watching early Delphine makes it really look like her feelings for Cosima are fake. That's why ex-girlfriend Delphine is so great - she's really good at selling the stifled jealousy.
orphanblack,3awnuc,Tziporahh,8,Wed Jun 24 20:00:26 2015 UTC,"Alison sends the kids to her ""parents"" in the beginning of Episode 4.  But that doesn't seem to jibe with the S3 marital situation of Alison's Mom.   Update:  episode 8. When talking with Aynsley about getting divorced Alison says the kids are at her Mom's.  So I guess the writers figured out Alison's back story by then."

Also.. Marion Bowles makes a deal with Cal/Mrs S to get castor information... So she is probably not a neolutionist (or at least not a high level one)since she didn't know about the castor project"

They want layers of insulation and obfuscation so that they can carry out their agendas more efficiently.  Marion, I feel, is yet another puppet.

orphanblack,3aud3a,janetplanet,15,Tue Jun 23 20:11:25 2015 UTC,"Or she can be ecstatic that he's gay? There are no other clones that have any appreciable taste in Fashion, which has been pointed out on numerous occasions by Fe.  The only one who does, Cosima, is more concerned with science and has a pretty basic fashion sense (like her clothes would mostly all go together in various combinations [hah!] and her wardrobe is awesome but not high fashion.)  I'd think if anything Sarah would get jealous that her new sestra is stealing her brother for shopping trips and general teenage girl mayhem."
orphanblack,3aud3a,zixkill,5,Tue Jun 23 21:07:15 2015 UTC,general teenage girl mayhem.   He's 23... lets hope not.

orphanblack,3aud3a,janetplanet,14,Wed Jun 24 00:55:49 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine she'd be at least a little pissed since Felix did steal her identity and get her abducted.

orphanblack,3atpgw,Black_Delphinium,6,Tue Jun 23 15:12:58 2015 UTC,I think all the monitors become lovers of the clones.  So far anyway.  Maybe not when they were kids. But then it was probably their parents.
orphanblack,3atpgw,a2scotty,5,Tue Jun 23 20:43:52 2015 UTC,"No, I mean Cosima's monitors develop feelings for her. Beth and Krystal's monitors didn't seems to develop any feelings towards them, but both Delphine and Cosima's previous monitors developed feelings for her after they started monitoring."
orphanblack,3atpgw,ca1cifer,4,Tue Jun 23 21:13:03 2015 UTC,"But how the fuck could you NOT fall in love with the impossibly smart, funny, awesome Cosima? ;)  All the monitors needed to get close to their clones so they likely had been psych tested for general compatibility. Delphine was a scientist, Paul used to be spec ops, Donnie was, uh, Allison's high school sweetheart.  They all needed to have strong commonality so the monitor really didn't seem out of place to the clone or the monitoring wouldn't have worked. It's very possible some of the clones were approached by multiple potential monitors until one stuck. A significant other would be the most effective person for a monitor to be so its totally logical honestly."
orphanblack,3atpgw,zixkill,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:30:31 2015 UTC,"I tend to believe Scott may be a neolutionist monitor, of sorts.

orphanblack,3atpgw,secretcrazy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:53:08 2015 UTC,Having the monitors be people dating them seems like a poor choice though. Yea there's a lot of access in that way but until a person gets married there must be a lot of different people they go through. Wouldn't a best friend be a better bet for longer term stability?
orphanblack,3atpgw,a2scotty,2,Tue Jun 23 23:08:10 2015 UTC,"I've always thought it was bad science to have monitors who are involved with the clones b/c they then become biased and not a neutral observer. Science demands some form of neutrality, doesn't it??"

She and her colleague Maurice Wilkins did much of the experimentation that led to the discovery of the double helix, which is normally attributed to Watson and Crick.

orphanblack,3atuap,Minn4theWin,3,Tue Jun 23 16:22:40 2015 UTC,Rachel would probably need about 2/3 of her body and brain replaced before she'd be normally-abled. Terminator Rachel shudder
orphanblack,3atuap,zixkill,0,Tue Jun 23 18:19:35 2015 UTC,"I see her as more of a Professor Xavier myself. I even thought that before the bionic eye, and now that just adds to it even more."
orphanblack,3aszv2,ca1cifer,19,Tue Jun 23 07:10:55 2015 UTC,"I think Neolution (probably Susan Duncan, the brains of the opperation, in particular) purposefully made Helena and Sarah fertile. Amelia was supposed to be carrying her babies for the Duncans, but she ran away and they got Rachel, one of the regular clones instead."
orphanblack,3aszv2,Tziporahh,3,Tue Jun 23 09:33:40 2015 UTC,"I totally buy into the Leda clones been the other side of the coin and creating a stronger human gene pool. The problem is the Castor disease only came to light once they were into their twenties. Dr Cody appeared surprised by the development.  In season 2 Ethan talked about how brilliant Susan was with some of the synthetic genes. Did she insert this cruel disease into the Castor's maybe? But it's odd. But, as Ethan told Rachael all the Leda's were meant to be barren. So, let's go with two factions at war over genes. Some are playing around with the genes, others have a clear plan. Result Sarah. But who created her?  The ""leaders"" of Susan's faction are interesting because we have zero idea who they are. The Doctor claims there have been there from the beginning. What does that mean? DYAD beginning? Or earlier? Why are they moving so many people around a huge chessboard. Why are they spending truckloads of money to monitor Leda's, to what end? Why would you follow women who are barren and dropping dead after a few coughs. The question becomes how many Leda's are there? Hundreds or thousands.  There is so much more to come out. The one thing that is the wild card is Kira. She's the end game."
orphanblack,3aszv2,Cissyhayes,5,Tue Jun 23 11:07:06 2015 UTC,"This is interesting though. Susan came up with the infertility sequences. I presume since castor have the same disease, they have the same sequence.  So Susan, who is now apart of Neoulition created the sterlisation disease. Whether it was intentional we don't know, but if it was it definitly fits in with this theory.  What if Sarah was designed to beat the disease. They could make whoever they wanted sterile. Sounds like Eugenics to me.  And Dyad are monitoring the clones under Topsides orders, its not neccesarily directed by Neolusion."
orphanblack,3aszv2,00Broobs00,4,Tue Jun 23 11:37:22 2015 UTC,"Sarah and Helena do not have the disease b/c they were meant to be the child of Ethan and Susan Duncan. So I imagine that they wanted this one (twins part of it probably wasn't planned) child to be fertile as it was to be theirs.  Amelia threw the monkey wrench in there and they took Rachel as a consolation prize, but Rachel had the infertility issue."
orphanblack,3aszv2,a2scotty,2,Tue Jun 23 20:50:09 2015 UTC,Not to go too off topic but if Sarah and Helena both are fertile and don't have the disease why didn't Cosima just cross examine their dna with the rest of Leda to isolate the infertility sequence?
orphanblack,3aszv2,aelxander,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:42:51 2015 UTC,I hope they deal with that. Unreproducible epigenetics?

orphanblack,3aszv2,00Broobs00,3,Wed Jun 24 07:42:08 2015 UTC,"I thought we were too assume Susan's faction is the Neolutionist, which are also the people behind Castor. My take away from the season finale is that the neolutionists were running/guiding both Castor and Leda from behind the scenes. If that's the case, then Cody doesn't need to know about the Castor STI. She just needed to weaponize it once she found out about it. The neolutionists might have known about the Castor STI and Cody was just a pawn.  Tziporahh mentioned that Susan could have purposely made Sarah special behind Ethan's back since they were supposed to get Sarah. Amelia also mentioned that they wanted to raise Sarah with Neolution influences, which would have to mean Ethan didn't know about it sense he's not a Neolutionist."
orphanblack,3aszv2,180K,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:14:08 2015 UTC,"And the fact that whatever disease it is in Castorclones didn't affect Sarah, or didn't make her sick. That is an interesting thread as well."

orphanblack,3aszv2,resurrexia,-1,Wed Jun 24 01:41:16 2015 UTC,"The question is,though, how would she have known that Beth committed suicide by going through that same process of placing her handbag on the ground? AFAIK none of the clones have told her of how Beth committed suicide, have they?"
orphanblack,3aszv2,WasabiSanjuro,2,Tue Jun 23 17:01:18 2015 UTC,"Well, first of all, unless you're carrying a tiny clutch (which would be highly unlikely if you were a professional career woman,) you would naturally put your purse down if you were prepared to flee for your life.  This make sense for two reasons:  you unburden yourself and perhaps your assailant would be delayed by going through your purse.      Secondly, there was security cam footage of that night that Art got to see, but I seriously doubt that Delphine would consciously attempt to re-create Beth's death scene, even if she had seen the footage."

orphanblack,3arppl,Tziporahh,5,Tue Jun 23 00:01:57 2015 UTC,A person with dark hair has to use hair bleach to get light hair. It's not just most likely it's the only thing possible. A toner of some time is needed though to make it not super orange after the bleach.
orphanblack,3arppl,secretcrazy,17,Tue Jun 23 00:03:34 2015 UTC,"I heard a theory that her bleached-looking hair may have been an epigentic response to her horrible childhood and living conditions (e.g. malnutrition and lack of exposure to sunlight).

I can't remember the exact information, though. This was like last year that I heard the theory.  But, yeah, I think it fits in with the nature/nurture thing with the clones.  They're products of their genes and as a result they have a lot of things in common with each other, but they're also all very heavily affected by their environments, and as a result are all radically different from one another."

I did love her lying on the floor with him though."

orphanblack,3ap7c2,antineo,27,Mon Jun 22 11:16:57 2015 UTC,"I think it was deliberately left ambiguous. They won't know yet if they can get EB for any of next season, and for what episodes. This way they can bring her back if they get the chance, or if they find out that they can't use her at all, they may decide to make it certain that she is dead.  In honestly I don't think that THEY know yet whether Delphine is DOA.   If they had truly wanted to kill her, they would have made it obvious. But that also doesn't mean that she's not going to be dead next season.  And you're right. They can't possibly tell the whole truth to people yet, which is why they are being vague. GM is dropping hints about dream seqences, but I reckon he's covering his ass in case EB shows up on set next season.  Its easier to lie about Rachel and Helena, as Tat's always going to be there anyway.    I'm content either way. I loved her storyline this year so I hope to see her back, but if not it was a poignant way to go out."

Honestly, to me it felt a little cheap because I immediately thought of this when they decided to 'fade to black' and cut the scene that way."

orphanblack,3ap7c2,zixkill,12,Tue Jun 23 18:58:34 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you - I definitely think Delphine is alive and that either she's been warned she cannot escape Neolution, therefore they shoot and capture her for leverage... or she has faked her own death in order to make her escape only to return later in the series when she is a bit clearer about the Neolution threat. For me, personally, I find it too cliche that Nealon tells Delphine that she will be dead by the morning then boom she's shot in the Dyad parking lot. Firstly, I don't think the writers would make it that obvious and secondly, I don't believe Delphine is stupid enough to return to Dyad after the threat Nealon made without good reason i.e. to fake her death on CCTV.  If it is the case that a Neolutionist shot her, I would disagree that Delphine knew she was going to be attacked by this person. I think she recognised the person's footsteps and turned around as if she was caught in the act of trying to escape from the reality of Neolutionism and Nealon's threat. This person obviously is very close to Delphine because they would have understood that she is referring to Cosima when she asks ""what will happen to her?"" which I'm translating to what will happen to Cosima if I leave, will she be safe still? This suggests to me that Delphine trusts the person she is speaking to and wouldn't anticipate them attacking her, so when she is attacked, its almost an answer to her question; she's not allowed to leave and also possibly, proof that the neolutionists have infiltrated her closest allies. It would be conceivable that Delphine, as new leader of Dyad, struck a deal with Topside when she took the role insisting that no harm would come to Cosima and now that she's caught leaving, she is possibly asking if this compromises Cosima?  Small thing I noticed, in her goodbye scene with Cosima, there is a flicker of a shadow behind them by the pillars next to Bubbles. Maybe Delphine informed someone she was going to leave and they wanted to make sure Delphine wasn't lying so they followed her to make sure. This would also make sense in terms of the question Delphine asks her attacker because they would then be aware she was just with Cosima and thus, Delphine doesn't need to directly reference Cosima in her question. If Delphine is faking her own death this would also make sense because then the person helps her to do this in the car park, a perfect setting in terms of providing proof to outside threats with video imaging, that she is 'gone', when really she isn't. This moving shadow could also just be a cameraman or passerby, but I don't think OB would make a technical error like that.  Delphine is necessary to the plot in quite a few ways and we've been reminded of her scientific significance since the start of the show: firstly, we're informed she's an immunologist, therefore, the perfect person to find the cure for Cosima and secondly, she says she studies host-parasite relationships... well what was that Neolution worm-like device Nealon had in his mouth? He is the host and the horrible worm thing is the parasite - Delphine could really become important from here on in working out what it is, or even being forced to work for Neolution in developing their host-parasite relationships.  I could be completely wrong but I think Delphine is playing the long-game here.  P.S. Ebro is always talking about Delphine having a well thought out plan this season, pretty sure a fake death could be part of that now!"
orphanblack,3ap7c2,delphinecosendgame,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:10:17 2015 UTC,"Good thoughts here and I am definitely on the same page as you.  I do have a theory about who shot her and the seeming continuation of a conversation in, ""What will happen to her?""   When Delphine called Sarah to tell Ferdinand about Rachel and neolution, I think she knew that would change things with him. Of course she didn't know this, but to us it was obvious by his reaction that he was changing teams, so to speak. I'm betting she knew that would happen.  I don't have it all figured out yet, but I'm beginning to wonder if Ferdinand shot Delphine. Not to kill, but to either seem like he is playing the game and keep up appearances or to use her to his advantage in some way to get Rachel back. At best, it was a mutually beneficial injury - at worst, Delphine is screwed... Idk. In this scenario, Delphine is asking Ferdinand what is going to happen to Rachel being in the hands of the neolutionists.  Maybe that's not it at all. Maybe it was someone else who shot her for any of the reasons you listed above. Ultimately, I don't believe she is dead. Long live Cophine!"
orphanblack,3ap7c2,brighteyes_bc,6,Mon Jun 22 23:07:09 2015 UTC,"In reference to OB's facebook page, this was posted 1.5 hours ago.  ""We made a choice to tell the strongest dramatic story we could. We did it working closely with Evelyne and Tatiana. The incredible actor that she is, Evelyne embraced the tragic climax to her character."" - Writers Graeme Manson and Aubrey Nealon on Orphan Black's shocking Season 3 finale: http://bbc.in/1GCr0L0      The vagueness of a ""tragic climax"" is compared to how Paul's death is explicitly stated.      ""We wanted Paul's death to tell us something about him, to show his decency and heroism. And not just for the character’s sake, but for the actor’s sake too. Dylan Bruce is a huge part of the OB family, and he deserved a proper sendoff. We did our best to give it to him."" - Aubrey Nealon, Orphan Black Writers' Blog"

orphanblack,3ap7c2,roguecit,7,Mon Jun 22 19:52:41 2015 UTC,"I think this explains everything. I guess he might as well have said: ""this character might be alive in S4 - it's just all about scheduling"". That's why there was no tribute, real farewell or anything like that. It's just the creators of this show needed to cover their asses, while leaving the door wide open for Evelyne Brochu to return if only she finds time to shoot (pun intended) her scenes. Manson's answer here isn't ""yeah, she's dead"". Of course, it's a cliffhanger, but if you read between the lines and know a bit about how shows like these are produced, you can easily guess they are doing the scheduling right now in order to be able keep Delphine alive. I am far from being biased here, but I really liked this character's development and transformation in season 3 and it would be a tragic waste of a great story if it was to end.    Here's an excerpt from an interview with Graeme Manson - LA Times:     LAT: So it’s 100% that she's dead? Is there a chance she's still alive?  GM: I suppose there's always a crack. There's always a chink.  LAT: You don't sound optimistic. Cosima is going to be so upset. You love killing off monitors. Should we be worried about Donnie now?  GM: No. Evelyne's our friend. I'm sure if there's a way we could loop her back in, you know, it's possible. The story is going to have to demand it, I'll just say that.    http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-orphan-black-finale-questions-20150622-story.html#page=1"

orphanblack,3ap7c2,ytotrip,2,Mon Jun 22 20:27:16 2015 UTC,"it's so hard to look at it objectively as a cophine shippper...but Ebro's scheduling aside, Delphine being dead or alive really depends on where the writers plan to take Cosima and the rest of cloneclub. They say this was done to drive her[cosima's] arc forward (they also say in their interviews that they had 'no idea' such and such would happen ie: how to introduce the male clones, how to bring back krystal). As sad as I am that Delphine might not be a part of that, I am super interested to see how Cosima develops and grows further as a result, and even how Delphine's potential death will impact the rest of the sisters. They might not have lost any sisters since Beth, but they've lost 2 vital allies...  give your sisters all my love </3"

orphanblack,3aot8j,bigbrotherfanatic,22,Mon Jun 22 07:38:34 2015 UTC,"I shall try.  Ethan and Susan were hired by the military to make clones. They got shut down so they went to Dyad instead with their clones. Meanwhile the military secretly kept the cloning up, making soldiers.  Coady takes control of them and at some point realises she can use them as a weapon.    Meanwhile Topside, a Cabal wants to own a monopoly on genetic engineering. They want to own all technology in order to maximise profits. They steer Dyad, or at least the clone section of it. It should be noted that DYAD is a large organisation within which a small department controls the cloning experiment, led by Topside. Marian appears to be the Dyad manager for Topside, with Rachel, and then Delphine as her coordinator.   The military sent spies (like Paul and Sammy) into DYAD in order to find out if they any more information on genetic treatment for the clones. I guess they think Ethan left his research there.  Castor, btw, was just the codename for the clone project. Project Leda was the original project and Castor appears to be an offshoot.  Around 6 years in or so Leakie gets involved with the clones at DYAD We don't know exactly what happens yet but it seems like he corrupted Susan Duncan, brought her into Neolution, and then blew up the research lab. Trying to kill Ethan Duncan presumably. Neolusion appears to be more prevalent than first though, and as Nealon tells Delphine that they have infiltrated both DYAD/Topside and the military, and appear to be using members of both organisations as pawns.   What the Neos really want remains to be seen, but Neolution is basically a self directed evolution. If Susan was into all along, it's possible she inserted sequences into the clones as some sort of neolution research. Why do some clones and Kira appear to heal faster than others? Why do Sarah and Kira seem to have advanced perception. I think it all leads back to Neolution  The prolethians aren't really connected. They are just crazy religious nuts. Tomas as his group hates genetic engineering, as they see it as unnatural. Henrick's groups believes that the fact that Helena is fertile is an act of god, and therefore wants to reproduce with her.  Henrick was an old lab assistant of Duncan, but aside from that, the Prolethians don't seem so connected to the others, so I wouldn't worry about them.  Unless we find out next season that Bonnie was the one who shot Delphine lol."
orphanblack,3aot8j,00Broobs00,2,Mon Jun 22 11:22:10 2015 UTC,Very nice! One question: Was there ever anything said about a connection between the military (Castor) and Topside? Or does Topside only steer Dyad (Leda) and the military is/was on its own?
orphanblack,3aot8j,zombiejh,2,Mon Jun 22 12:23:27 2015 UTC,"Topside never steered Castor. Marian found out about them having male clones, and obviously Topside isn't going to be happy about that as it weakens their monopoly.  but it isn't clear how many of each group are Neolutionists. If I had to guess I would say Benchman is one."
orphanblack,3aot8j,00Broobs00,2,Mon Jun 22 12:33:07 2015 UTC,"After the final episode, because Charlotte shows up with Mrs Duncan, everything Marian has said is now totally suspect and she is very possibly a Neolutionist. At this point I think Topside is just a total joke. Poor Ferdinand."

orphanblack,3aot8j,haaaaaaveyoumetme,9,Tue Jun 23 06:46:08 2015 UTC,"Super simplistic: Leda - Female cloning project. Run by Dyad. Original: Kendall Malone. Started by Susan and Ethan Duncan.  Dyad - Large company working on various scientific projects including secretly project Leda. Directed by Topside.   Topside - Cabal that tries to shift public opinion and the law in favour of the work being done at Dyad and similar companies. Ensures Dyad/project Leda are running smoothly. Has been trying to create new clones, so far only one success: Charlotte. Includes Marion Bowles who s2 discovered Castor exists. And Ferdinand, a 'cleaner' who apparently hates neolutionists.  Castor - The male cloning project, run by the military. Clones have a defect that is killing them, which they are trying to weaponise. They infiltrated Prolethians (Mark) and project Leda (Paul and Sammy) to try and gain information that could help. Run by Dr Virginia Coady. Seems to be overseen by the Department of Defense in Arlington.   Department of Defense - Runs Castor through the military. They wanted the weaponising. They used Gracie as a mole in Leader to get the book with Duncan's codes.  Neolutionists - group who believe in 'self-directed evolution'. Have definitely infiltrated Dyad, Leda, and Topside. Presumably also the other groups. Notables: Leekie, guy with tail from s1, Dr Nealon+gross worm thing.  Prolethians -  Extremely religious group. Traditional prolethians thought science was blasphemy, clones were abominations. Trained Helena to kill clones, led by Tomas. New-age prolethians believed in using science in god's name. Thought Helena was a miracle, blessed by god. 'to reproduce is divine'. Run by Hendrik Johanssen, who was the lab partner of Ethan Duncan in the very early stages of the Leda project."

I imagine most of the other clones would have tried to be nice and maybe let Rudy believe he had a purpose but not Helena.  I agree that I would have loved for the two psychos to really hammer it out together but all in all, it was just a perfect scene."
orphanblack,3aot1k,VulvaAutonomy,2,Mon Jun 22 18:09:23 2015 UTC,"I was fine with the non-sugar coat as Rudy was the one that brought up the ""we had a purpose"" thing, so I guess what I was asking for was a little more dimensional character out of Helena (which is asking maybe too much cause she is 1-dimensional at times, but at the same time she isn't when it comes to children, and Rudy was ""as helpless as child"" so to speak here)... I'm not a writer for the show, but I felt like there could have been more... I'm thinking of the long monologues Breaking Bad style. Not that long, but longer than what we were given."

""Leave the audience wanting more"", I say!"
orphanblack,3aot1k,zixkill,2,Tue Jun 23 05:59:17 2015 UTC,"I agree, it was a perfect length. Neither of them mince words or are overly talkative. Helena usually only carries on if she's torturing someone, and Rudy too I think. For the two of them this was a sweet farewell."

orphanblack,3an0uu,FatPinkMast,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:09:16 2015 UTC,Have been hearing good things as well. I was skeptical since networks also did Bates Motel near the same time and they both seemed like movie to TV gimmicks.
orphanblack,3an0uu,FlyRobot,3,Mon Jun 22 15:31:22 2015 UTC,"I was put off because of the initial promos too. But I love the books and movies, so I thought I'd give it a go. Brian Fuller has completely re-invented the Hannibal universe in such a grotesquely beautiful way. Mads Mikkelsen is amazing as Hannibal, he's so good I've forgotten all about Anthony Hopkins. It's artsy, atmospheric, grotesque, baroque, smart and psychological television, with these gruesome murder tableaus that are horrifying to look at but also so beautifully composed and framed that you can't look away.... You kind of just have to get past the first 5-6 eps of the first season, after that it really starts to get into the nitty-gritty of the over-arching story. Honestly, don't let the fact it's on network TV put you off, I actually can't believe that it is. You may feel the need to check yourself into a psych ward after a while (especially if you binge watch it), but that's all part of the experience... it's one of those those shows that really gets under your skin. And the second season is amazing."

She stopoed the car and just looked at me like ""Are you serious!!?"" and I was pretty confused so after some seconds she just burated out ""Omg thats my favourite series too 😱"" and then she went on about all these medical terms I know jackshit about.  It was a pretty funny and really confusing moment to be honest."

orphanblack,3an0uu,greatkingrat,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:32:40 2015 UTC,"I love the show. Its a extention on the original idea of the movie, with a lot more depth on the history, that is a little changed. I recommend you to watch the first episode, that is the Pilot, and see if you like it or not."
orphanblack,3an0uu,illuminatihotline,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:23:36 2015 UTC,"Seconded. It's more straight-forward than the movie (which I love too) but goes places you never think it would. Kick Acevedo (Charlie from Fringe) is in it too, and he's spectacular."

If you can track it down (and look past the low budget, though for me that's kind of part of its charm) it's worth a watch."

If someone told me I wouldn't be alive the next morning I'd be on the first plane out of the country. They've managed to hide Kira and Kendall Malone so there's no reason they couldn't protect Delphine. Unless she's not really dead, I mean it's only a stomach shot, she could recover."
orphanblack,3aouh6,illuminatihotline,2,Mon Jun 22 09:12:33 2015 UTC,"Delphine found out what kind of dangerous shitshow she signed up for probably when she became Cosima's monitor.

orphanblack,3aouh6,SamHerry,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:08:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like that idea. I can see Mrs S being the one to shoot her - Delphine's response to the shooter then makes sense and Mrs S would know that Delphine is asking about Cosima. Can see Mrs S and her birdwatchers helping out. Would be awesome if Delphine came back and I still believe Cophine are endgame and that Shay is Shay-deee. Don't see Delphine coming back until the end of Season 4 or for Season 5 because of Evelyne's schedule. Also, maybe that's why they cut the Delphine/Mrs S scene from one episode - because it would have given too many clues? I would like to see them work together. Can imagine Season 4 being Cosima unravelling, more Shay, maybe even one of the clones turning to the dark side. That would be interesting."
orphanblack,3aouh6,OBhookedme,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:24:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but storywise, wouldn't it make more sense to keep the Mrs. S/Delphine deleted scene if she would help Delphine disappear?

orphanblack,3aohnw,sumofawitch,9,Mon Jun 22 05:07:11 2015 UTC,"There's way too much bad blood between Rachel and the others. She continued to manipulate them and tried to have them all killed up until late on.  The difference between Helena and Rachel is that Rachel was raised self aware so she can be held accountable for her actions, whereas Helena was indoctrinated by the Proletheans."
orphanblack,3aohnw,Hawkguy67,5,Mon Jun 22 05:29:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think that being ""self-aware"" makes Rachel less redeemable than Helena.  Rachel was brainwashed and manipulated her entire childhood as well, just in a gentler fashion.  Most of the crap she has pulled has been to please Topside or because of jealousy of Sarah.    Please remember that if Helena had been able to find Alison or Cosima in the first season, they would no longer be with us.  I thought it was a little uncomfortable when Sarah toasted to Beth at the dinner party seeing as how if that had been Beth that Helena had tackled the first time she met Sarah, Helena would have murdered her with no remorse.  I don't see any reason that Rachel couldn't also decide to join her sisters.  I've always assumed that will be part of the end game of the series."
orphanblack,3aohnw,pennysquisher,6,Mon Jun 22 06:51:40 2015 UTC,"My strongest desire for next season is to have a plotline where Sarah breaks into Neolution HQ with the goal of rescuing Charlotte, the baby sestra. Then she's surprised to find Rachel there too. She sighs, rolls her eyes, and mutters, ""I guess you're a sestra too, come on then."""
orphanblack,3aohnw,purebutter,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:28:11 2015 UTC,"Would be nice in theory, and I could see Sarah have sympathy for Rachel, but at the same time I feel the series will end with Rachel still being on the outside.  Also, didn't we all secretly still love Helena even when she was killing clones?"
orphanblack,3aohnw,majestic-incarnate,2,Tue Jun 23 22:32:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's just my propunk dream. I don't see it being likely to happen. My guess is that Rachel will remain on the outside but slowly come around starting next season, and only 100% affirm her loyalties with Clone Club at the conclusion of the series and/or shortly before she gets killed off. But I do think she will come around eventually."
orphanblack,3aohnw,purebutter,5,Tue Jun 23 23:11:18 2015 UTC,Rachel is too far gone.  She's too damaged.  Maybe she's hit rock bottom now but maybe not.  She's lived like a rat in a cage her whole life.  Take away the cage and she won't know who she is.  She might be right where she wants to be now that she knows her foster mother is alive and she'll be given a daughter-sestra.  I don't think Rachel will want to be rescued now.
orphanblack,3aohnw,BurnetRhoades,3,Mon Jun 22 16:30:36 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much not going to happen.  At all.  Rachel was the one who was behind the murders of her other sestras and she bears a very strong grudge against Sarah for multiple reasons.  And now that Rachel will be part of the Neolutionist tribe, got reunited with her mother, and now has a daughter of her own, yeah...  Clone Club is not in the works for her."

orphanblack,3aohnw,kah43,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:29:29 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of parallels between Helena and Rachel. Both have killed other clones, both have fucked up childhoods (although I still argue that Helena had it worse, being made to kill a puppy - not that it's a pissing contest), both tried to steal Kira, etc....   But Helena never tried to kill Sarah, after she realized there was a connection. And Helena realized the intrinsic value of Kira and would never have stomped out a vial of her bone marrow, that sacrifice, out of spite. Helena loves her niece. Rachel only wants to own her.   Let's not forget that she still tried to double cross the club even at the last second. She took a chance at redemption and turned it into a moment of opportunity for herself. She has done wrong by Sarah - grievous, terrible wrong - and still tries to get one over her. She's a snake. Maybe a tragic snake, but a snake nonetheless."

orphanblack,3ane3o,pennysquisher,8,Mon Jun 22 00:03:57 2015 UTC,"It's hard to know, because Krystal shouldn't have been affected by the pathogen if they did have sex, because the Castor pathogen is the same thing that makes the Leda clones infertile and causes their disease.  Only Sarah and Helena don't have it, and they're apparently immune to it."
orphanblack,3ane3o,badgersprite,5,Mon Jun 22 00:24:29 2015 UTC,"Unless that is only a Sarah and helena thing,  the pathogen was not tested on the other clones. Unless Krystal did have sex with them but we don't know that for sure."
orphanblack,3ane3o,Lady_borg,8,Mon Jun 22 00:30:11 2015 UTC,"No, what I'm saying is that Krystal should already have the disease the Castor pathogen causes, just dormant.  The Castor pathogen is like a contagious version of the illness Cosima and the other Leda clones have."
orphanblack,3ane3o,badgersprite,30,Mon Jun 22 00:36:09 2015 UTC,"Damn it, and this show has done so well so far with avoiding incest!   Sure, because Felix and Tony kissing wasn't weird at all."
orphanblack,3ane3o,wotkay,15,Sun Jun 21 23:00:01 2015 UTC,"Well, Felix and Sarah aren't biologically related so it's not technically incest.  Though I'd like to see a DNA test to be sure.    Someone test Felix's DNA stat."

There's no low points or boring unnecessary plotlines. It kept moving, which allowed the stories to unravel quickly.

orphanblack,3anxr2,kncrnr,2,Mon Jun 22 07:16:16 2015 UTC,"I really loved season 2. Season 1 was basically flawless but it didn't aim as high as 2 & 3.

orphanblack,3alwpb,ohheyitskt,17,Sun Jun 21 15:34:49 2015 UTC,"I hope so too, but I don't think that is the case. Like I said in another thread, you don't cast someone like Michelle Forbes for such a minor role and then just have her disappear, she is probably the most well-know actor they've signed on outside of this show.   I think giving Charlotte to Rachel is their way of bringing her  around to the Neo regime. They know how badly Rachel wanted to be a mother, it's a manipulative gesture of ""good-will"". And where did Nealon go when he left Sarah alone with Rachel before the oophorectomy? I always though it odd that she just walked out of the operating theatre and met no resistance, but if Marion gave the order then that all makes sense."

orphanblack,3an9bp,badgersprite,4,Sun Jun 21 22:56:55 2015 UTC,"I'm more worried that it's a worm that has a purpose to begin with. The concept is what's too silly for me. But if it turns out to be a ""cyanide pill worm"", some real life poisonous critter the purpose of which was to give that doctor guy a really weird convoluted death-- I guess that would be the most acceptable answer to me? Maybe you can see where I'm coming from with my worry."
orphanblack,3an9bp,badgersprite,6,Sun Jun 21 23:02:51 2015 UTC,For all we know the worm is just a microchip that can self-remove. Having microchips implanted in people that enables Neolution to track them and which can switch bodies would not be that farfetched or silly.
orphanblack,3an9bp,Lady_borg,3,Sun Jun 21 23:37:30 2015 UTC,"This was my thought weirdly enough, in the same scene where the Neolutionists are confirmed as back we see a worm come out of nowhere, apparently weaponised. I thought yeah, it was poisonous,  under his control or he created it from his body."
orphanblack,3an9bp,badgersprite,6,Mon Jun 22 00:35:56 2015 UTC,"It could be any number of things, really.  My personal theory is that it's a transferable microchip that can track and terminate its host. This raises a potential storyline in the future wherein we don't know how many people have been implanted with chips.  It would also give Neolution a means of finding Kira and Malone if one of the clones is unknowingly chipped.  Ferdinand could also be chipped and giving away information about the clones, only for him to be terminated."
orphanblack,3an9bp,Tziporahh,4,Mon Jun 22 00:40:58 2015 UTC,"Even if it's fully robotic, it's still goofier than anything the show has done yet, when you consider it was carefully designed to look and behave like a worm. I understand we don't know all yet, but in the established world of Orphan Black that scene was pretty garish."
orphanblack,3an9bp,bignatebig,4,Mon Jun 22 01:44:35 2015 UTC,We don't really know what the worm can do. It seemingly has some toxicity to it since Nealon tries to force it into Delphine... It doesn't have to be advanced AI. We program little robots to move like bugs nowadays.  Perhaps it's just a robot that Nealon can communicate with using some kind of biological signal. The moving around seems very possible with even today's robotics. I don't think it's out if the realm of possibility at all.  I'm excited to have neolution back lol.
orphanblack,3an9bp,Tziporahh,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:16:07 2015 UTC,"Although the idea of it being a robot is possible, wouldn't it make more sense to make a robot worm look more, say, robot? (As per eye!) I'm thinking it's either biologically engineered (bad plot turn, writers), or an alien (whoop I just left the show)."
orphanblack,3an9bp,badgersprite,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:16:03 2015 UTC,Why would we want a robot to look more like a robot? I feel like generally we try to make them as human (or in this case as worm) as possible.
orphanblack,3an9bp,badgersprite,6,Fri Jun 26 06:15:38 2015 UTC,Um...This is a show where a guy grew a tail on himself and Helena cut it off and danced with it.  Orphan Black has always had wacky elements.
orphanblack,3an9bp,25willp,2,Mon Jun 22 01:45:55 2015 UTC,"My opinion is the tail was a lot more scientifically reasonable. I understand that could be argued. And my point is about the consistency of the show's science, logic and parameters, not how over the top the tone of a scene is allowed to be. The Allison/Donny rap montage was ridiculous and fun and awesome-- maybe for some people too silly and cheesy, but due to tone, not logic."
orphanblack,3an9bp,25willp,2,Mon Jun 22 01:56:19 2015 UTC,"How is developing a microchip/spy device that can easily implant itself in a person, kill the person and remove itself scientifically illogical? That's a very logical thing for a military contractor to develop.  The worm design may be the most efficient way of burrowing into a host's skin and of allowing it to move between hosts. The worm design may also protect the device from being detected by scanners.  This show has never taken itself too seriously, either. I don't see how this is remotely out of place."
orphanblack,3an9bp,25willp,0,Mon Jun 22 02:00:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's illogical to want to make it-- it's not illogical for such a contractor to want to make a laser gun. That doesn't make it reasonable that they can. If the show about clothes having a sense of humor is a free pass on intricate wormbots, what does going too far look like?  I'm going to leave that phone-made spelling error there."
orphanblack,3an9bp,haaaaaaveyoumetme,3,Mon Jun 22 02:07:38 2015 UTC,I love crazy sci-fi I hope it goes full sci-fi. Both LOST and Person of Interest went full sic-fi and they both were awesome.
orphanblack,3an9bp,KingOfTheEverything,0,Mon Jun 22 01:43:30 2015 UTC,"If in Breaking Bad the meth suddenly gave people superpowers, I'd be worried, or worse, even though I can enjoy superhero stories. For me two seasons of lengthy episodes is just too long for this sharp of a (potential) turn."
orphanblack,3an9bp,vadergeek,2,Mon Jun 22 01:51:17 2015 UTC,Totally disagree. Look at Game of Thrones.  GOT Spoiler I think Orphan Black is similar to that in the way that it has been growing the sci-fi as it goes along.
orphanblack,3an9bp,vadergeek,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:14:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd argue it's been growing laterally, using what we know about how clones work to build the sci-fi fun. Nothing, including the tail, has been leading to advanced worm technology."
orphanblack,3an9bp,WasabiSanjuro,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:19:08 2015 UTC,"I have faith in OB's science, some things about this show can be criticised but they have always been really good on the science side."
orphanblack,3an9bp,crhelix,2,Mon Jun 22 03:39:51 2015 UTC,"I was okay with the worm because I highly doubt it'll be as ridiculous as mind control. Everything else in this show has been fairly close to reality, I can't see them introducing something they don't have at least a partial scientific explanation for. Also it just made so much sense story-wise. It comes right after Nealon says ""wherever you think the science is at, I guarantee you're wrong"". Of course the Neolutionists would have developed a whole other level of crazy science."
orphanblack,3an9bp,WasabiSanjuro,3,Mon Jun 22 04:10:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're probably right. The visual at the time just seemed really dumb, and I do think it was a bit lame if that was all for shock value, but I think or hope that it probably was for the effect of the scene. It's kind of an established habit of these writers to make you believe they're going in an unreasonable direction right before pulling back (Shay), and it's kind of a habit of mine to keep falling for it."
orphanblack,3an9bp,usuki,2,Mon Jun 22 05:15:42 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming the writers know what they're doing. They've never steered too far away, in fact they tend to answer doubts in the following episodes"
orphanblack,3an9bp,usuki,2,Tue Jun 23 02:28:14 2015 UTC,The science has always been somewhat better than our own.
orphanblack,3an9bp,aleidascop,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:55:15 2015 UTC,In the field of clonery true
orphanblack,3an9bp,aleidascop,4,Mon Jun 22 01:45:51 2015 UTC,"Biotech in general, really. Prosthetic tails?"
orphanblack,3an9bp,25willp,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:58:24 2015 UTC,I think we're missing the point of the worm.  The Neolutionists are all about genetic manipulation...but they never specifically stated that they're only interested in the manipulation of the human genome.  It's not entirely unreasonable to believe that they would resort to bioweaponry and engineered assault organisms.
orphanblack,3ammwb,hush-art,4,Sun Jun 21 18:45:04 2015 UTC,"This is a beautiful painting, but it doesn't look anything like Delphine (looks like an elderly mom)."
orphanblack,3ammwb,shzadh,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:42:16 2015 UTC,"That's beautiful, she looks very sad but ethereal. I love what you did with the hair."
orphanblack,3ao4z2,baronvonvon,6,Mon Jun 22 02:56:57 2015 UTC,"I'm excited to see angry, vengeful, focused Cosima. However i will miss Delphine. I actually welled up when Delphine's last thought was of Cosima. I'm interested in seeing if Cosima will ever find out that Delphine's been killed, and how it will affect her relationship with shay. After all, this is a lot to process within what, a month or two of knowing your new girlfriend?   I agree with you on this season. It actually feels worse than the last. It kind of veered around, as if it didn't know where to focus.  Allison, as always, had a completely separate storyline that was even more removed from the central storyline. At least last season she brushed up against Art and bitch cop, who were investigating Sarah - as - Beth and some bird watcher / Prolethian action. In short it kind of felt like the viewers were hamsters, going from one scattered clump of crumbs to another, instead of eating one whole string of cheese.   I love the detailed write up you have... I wish this sub reddit was more than a few speculation posts and a bunch of reactions."
orphanblack,3ao4z2,sadcatpanda,3,Mon Jun 22 04:12:42 2015 UTC,"They didn't give the Castor clones the full personalities that the sestras got.   Now maybe the reason for these impressions is because much of this season feels like they're from Sarah's perspective. She doesn't care much for Castor, so they don't get fleshed out.    I strongly think it's really just that the male clones were all raised in relative isolation together.  Whereas the girl clones all had unique upbringings and histories, which totally explains why they are so different.  The male clones have similar mannerisms because they all shared a room, had little contact with others, and all went through the same shit together.  I think the show does an excellent job of their love/hate tension with one another, their selves, as well as how similar they are due to their upbringing while still having distinct personalities."
orphanblack,3ao4z2,middlegray,2,Mon Jun 22 04:40:21 2015 UTC,"I agree re: the Sarah Manning chronicles. The writers seem unnecessarily attached to having her as the main character. It made sense in the beginning, she was out entry point into all this but I'm so ready to see a Cosima driven season or even one where all the clones are featured more. We see a lot of 2 clones scenes where Sarah interacts with the other sisters...but the scenes with 2 non-sarah clones are often extremely powerful. I'd love more of those too."
