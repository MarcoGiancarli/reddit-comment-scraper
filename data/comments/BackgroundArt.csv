BackgroundArt,3bob4w,marviemundullo,8,Tue Jun 30 20:39:02 2015 UTC,"While the first few are indeed the Ancient Forest,  I think the last few are the Sleeping Forest.  Nice set though, OP. Unlike others,  I'm less excited for the remake, and I'm going to blab about that for a second. It's true the polygons aged pretty terribly in comparison to the charm of 6's sprites. However,  the backgrounds are pretty beautiful (again, thanks OP!), and there's a lot happening in more modern FF'S that totally turn me off. It's like Jordan coming out of retirement, or Lucas creating the Special Editions: It's the owners right, but it replaces old problems with new ones.   7 has warts: the aforementioned low poly rendering and a pretty horrifying localization/translation. However, I've seen some warts in more contemporary FF's as well. I'm scared to see them applied to 7.  An attempt at realism over style. Awkward animations. Endless corridors. Melodramatic writing. Terrible voice acting.   A decade ago we were told we'd never get a remake of FF7. That's when a lot of us wanted one. Now, coming up on 20 years after it's initial release, we are getting a remake. But I don't feel the need for one anymore. 7 was a good game because it did a lot of things we hadn't seen done before 1997. Remaking it with better graphics won't make a great game. Maybe it will be good, but lightning won't strike twice. I'd rather Square invest their efforts in a new IP that tells a story in a new and engaging way, rather than trying to remake old warhorses with modern flaws."
BackgroundArt,3bob4w,Fiver1453,4,Wed Jul 1 06:29:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not getting the remake until the reviews come in, especially after Square said it's not going to be a true remake but a re-visioning. I'm not dropping scratch on a game that could just be another auto-battling hallway simulator. IMO they haven't made a good Final Fantasy since X."
BackgroundArt,3bob4w,thedude213,2,Wed Jul 1 10:55:35 2015 UTC,I brought this up in another thread and it didn't gain much traction but I'll say it again; after Dirge of Cerberus i would like Nomura to never touch the story and characters of 7 again. That game was a goddamn train wreck.
BackgroundArt,3bob4w,corporateswine,3,Wed Jul 1 14:36:47 2015 UTC,"The only thing Nomura did for DoC was character design, same as he did with FF7. The story was Yoshinora Kitase, same as FF7, a good chunk of the staff was the same staff as FFVII.  Nomura himself hasn't actually screwed anything up, he just becomes the 'go-to' guy for FF sometimes, the only projects he's directed himself are FFXV (when it was versus), along with parts of Kingdom Hearts (where he was mainly the character artist anyway), and a few other things such as  The World Ends With You. Thats it.  TLDR: Nomura only made character designs, stop blaming him for stuff out of his control."
BackgroundArt,3bob4w,Dan_Tsukasa,2,Thu Jul 2 17:48:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't actually know this and will keep this in mind, but on that note is Nomura is responsible for the character design in the kingdom hearts series and FFX then he is still a hack. Iam still waiting for him to design a character that is just a hulking massive golem of buckles, belts, zippers, chokers and chains."
BackgroundArt,3bob4w,corporateswine,2,Thu Jul 2 19:22:29 2015 UTC,"Kingdom Hearts: Director, concept design, main character designer, storyboard designer, base story  Seems I was wrong on the Kingdom Hearts Front, my bad, remembered wrong.  For FFX he was Character Designer yeah.  This said, everyone else can still say 'we don't like it' and he has to change it, but instead his stuff makes it in, and until maybe FF13 nobody much cared, since then its been all about belts and buckles etc, I feel like it began thanks to the Jim Sterling rant, and then a lot of people jut went 'OMG Jims right I just never noticed it before! IF you didn't notice it, it wasn't much of a problem.  I do think he has a knack of over complicating designs though.  Its not like I know the guy or anything, I just think theres an entire team of like 200 people on a game, at least 2-5 other people have the power to say they dislike his stuff, but they obviously like it."
BackgroundArt,3bob4w,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:39:49 2015 UTC,"I feel like his designs from FF7 - 9 were ""out there"" but not so much that it really stuck out, then FFX came along and its like he discovered psychedelics or something. I've never heard the Jim Sterling rant but it was Something Awful's Fashion SWAT that made me realize ""Holy shit, Tidus really is wearing a quarter half shit and a third of pants"". As much as I like shit on Nomura from time to time I have to say I've come to enjoy his costume design choices as an absurd display of surrealism.  But seriously, wtf is going on with Sora's feet."
BackgroundArt,3bob4w,corporateswine,2,Thu Jul 2 20:00:00 2015 UTC,"Nomura didn't do IX actually, I'm not sure who did but he wasn't involved in IX in any way whatsoever. But its true there are a few things in there that you'd typically attribute to him.  Soras feet are... different.  I think if FF6 was remade we'd notice a lot of belts and odd stuff there too, you have to take into account that back before FF7 they were designing stuff, knowing 90% of the detail never made it into the sprites, so belts and stuff just couldn't be done it wasn't possible, so its hard to say if those games would have had similar designs if tech were good back then."

I will however be skipping some background animations and making them static, if all that animates is a flag blowing or a tiny cog animating in the corner then really not going to waste time making those animated and instead I'll have them static. The game has a lot of areas where the only animated object is a flag waving lightly, or something tiny waving in the background thats barely visible anyway.  Note: These are gifs and might not show on your mobile device of choice.

It's one of the seven DVDs I actually own (including series as one unit), and yes, I still cry at the end.  It's likely the first movie I cried about as a kid.  Seeing Charlie in one of those pictures causes similar feelings to the ones I get when I see pictures of my late grandfather, the guy that was my world.  I mean really, best American movie ever.  Stunning art.  Because of this movie I got my dog, and I'm glad.  I had no idea that an animal could mean so much to so many people, but my dog is amazing.  My family fight over visitation.  And yeah, my Charlie has a little sidekick we adopted later.  Not a Weiner Dog, but still.  I'm aware of how pathetic I sound.  I don't care.  This movie is fucking amazing.  This movie made me understand love while I was ""raised"" in a fucking meth den.  It taught me that people that come from bad places can choose to be good people.  It taught me that I can be a good person.  It taught me to share.  The background art is amazing, and I absolutely want to get prints of these.  How would I go about that?

BackgroundArt,39ble6,colinclark,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:41:55 2015 UTC,"To be honest I just want to see you upload some awesome backgrounds   My first try, what do you think? Maybe I took too many pictures and too many unimpressive ones, but I like it. I am pretty proud that I actually managed to fuse two panoramas together. One didn't work out two well, since the perspective changed, but the second one, formed of three inidivduals, looks pretty good. At least I think so.  I'll post it after your judgement. If it's worth posting, that is."
BackgroundArt,39ble6,colacube,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:41:51 2015 UTC,"Hey Hey.  Please, don't wait for my judgement, I'm no expert.  But my 2cents are this.  Those Panoramas are great, I love the one with the building especially, really nice, looks like it was 3 images too, seemless man, well done!  I'd cut out maybe 30 of those images, if a character takes up more than 1/4 of the image, then the characters no longer incidental, he's the focus and you can't really see enough of the background to see how well done it is.  The main thing with BG art is deciding whether a backgrounds worth snapping or not, for example I'm 15 episodes into Ao no Exorcist now (the one I used in the tutorial image was from episode 2) and I've snapped maybe 5-6 backgrounds in total, most are just standard anime backgrounds, nothing impressive, not bad by any stretch but not worth sharing online.  The resolution of these is low but its clearly an old short and so its clear there aren't higer resolution versions.  Honestly I think you did a great job here. I think my first ever one didn't even contain any panoramas at all.  Edit: Heres my original submittion from a year ago http://imgur.com/a/yaU8o  If you do a search by name you'll see I improved and I'm sure you'll do the same.  Best of luck my friend."

I narrowed it down to 27 images. And there are many interesting shots with detailed background with characters in the way. I still think they are worth seeing. Can a background really be background without foreground? Without characters it's just sceneryart, isn't it? But yeah, characters definitely shouldn't take up too much space.  I actually have the DVD. I was surprised by the low quality, but it old. What can I do.  I am really proud of that 3 piece panorama. You can a slight transition in the upper third, but that's fine.  Thank you for your feedback and for the tutorial.  PS: Even looking at it now, it should've get a few more pics, but too late, I'll fucking post it."

BackgroundArt,377xak,DerpyDan,22,Mon May 25 16:43:57 2015 UTC,"I'll run you down how I do it, you're probably expecting something dramatic but its super simple. Honestly I think we should sticky this thread.   Get my video file, be it DVD, Download, Itunes etc Open up VLC Watch video and wait for things you want to snapshot (If its good try not to ruin it for yourself by snapping, maybe do in a rewatch). Take pictures regularly, so lets say every 1 second I press the screenshot hotkey (which I changed to S).   This means you'll be capturing the same thing several times, your screenshots will overlap but that doesn't matter anyway because they'll all line up perfectly.  So these 4 screenshots for example, they're part of 1 panning shot from Ao no Exorcist * Shot 1 * Shot 2 * Shot 3 * Shot 4  Now 2 of these have subtitles in them, which isn't ideal, but in this case I didn't snap very well and so didn't find a frame without the subtitles, thats the issue with embedded subs, sometimes you'll have to live with having a bit of text in your snapshot or Panorama, so when you can soft subs are the best (or no subs at all), depends, this show talks about things I don't understand in Japanese, so I need subs for this one, seriously, why would I need to know how to talk about realms, demons and exorcism in Japanese anyway.   Take those screenshots into Photoshop Take the frame where you want your panorama to start and extend the canvas size, not image size, by any amount (I often do often 400%). After doing that and copying my picture into 1 photoshop document I get this: http://i.imgur.com/6hCZoXy.jpg   You can see its panning but of course its not lined up at all.   Line up your images and you should get this: http://i.imgur.com/SZx5Zhs.jpg Crop and save your image out and upload it to imgur (whilst we love images, imgur is best as we can back things up if need be).   Take care to line up edges, try to keep that looking the way its supposed to, if somethings a pixel or 2 off its going to look weird.  I've circled the areas I used to try and line things up for this image, if that steeple had been cut off suddenly, I know I made a mistake, its just eyeballing it, nothing fancy.  Sometimes there are camera effects used, or theres animation happening and its difficult to line things up perfectly. This is where multiple shots come in handy, if characters or objects are moving about on a background, try to get a shot when they move, after a few shots you should, depending on whats happening onscreen, a set of photos that you can overlay and just erase the characters from.  Layering in photoshop (OR gimp, or whatever you might use) is great for this, you can erase elements that ruin your image, and if you're lucky you can use the content aware, or clone-stamp tools to fix areas in the image, such as removing subtitles, sometimes its perfect, othertimes it takes a while.  These are the methods I use, its nothing complex, sometimes it can be a little tedious but thats it, its just screenshots and then stitching them together, we're not really ripping the actual panorama from the video, just what we see, usually the image onscreen is a lot larger than whats filmed, such as in my example, that city background is obviously a lot wider than that, but since I can only capture whats onscreen I'm left with that staircase type view.  If you want to test it out you can just use those images I uploaded, then once you're comfortable grab your own shots and go at it.  Best of luck and looking forward to seeing what you snap.   Pro-tip, higher resolution is better.  /u/colacube how do I add a post to the sidebar, provided we agree this is worth it."

A lot of the textures are too busy or have obvious repeating patterns when tiled. They could also have benefited from establishing better color schemes for each zone and creating visual hierarchy.  On the other hand, the isometric representation of objects and characters looks good, and there's a lot of great detail in most environments.

To reward production, the government hands out extremely addictive, popsicle-like ""Juicybars"", which in turn also makes them constipated. Aachi and Ssipak are street hoodlums who struggle to survive by trading black market Juicybars. Through a chain of events involving their porn-director acquaintance Jimmy the Freak, they meet a porn star named Beautiful, whose defecations are rewarded by exceptional quantities of Juicybars. For that reason, Beautiful is also wanted by the violent blue mutants known as the Diaper Gang (led by the Diaper King), the police (most notably the cyborg police officer Geko), and others."""

BackgroundArt,2zlfrd,autowikibot,3,Thu Mar 19 15:49:10 2015 UTC,"Rock & Rule:       Rock & Rule (known as Ring of Power outside of North America) is a 1983 Canadian animated musical science fiction fantasy film from the animation studio Nelvana. It was produced and directed by the company's founders, Michael Hirsh, Patrick Loubert, and Clive A. Smith. The film features the voices of Don Francks, Greg Salata, and Susan Roman. It was the studio's first feature film and the first one produced entirely within Canada.  Centering on rock and roll music, the film includes songs by Cheap Trick, Chris Stein and Debbie Harry of the pop group Blondie, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, and Earth, Wind & Fire. The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic United States populated by mutant humanoids. With John Halfpenny, Patrick Loubert, and Peter Sauder at the helm of its screenplay, Rock & Rule was a heavily derived spin-off of Nelvana's earlier TV special from 1978, The Devil and Daniel Mouse. Its distributor, MGM, acquired United Artists at the time and the new management team had no interest in it. As a result, it was never released in North America except for a limited release in Boston, Massachusetts. It received minor attention in Germany, where it was screened at a film festival. it was funded in part by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which had obtained the Canadian TV rights. A hard-to-find VHS was released at that time, followed by a laserdisc release. The film developed a cult following from repeated airings on HBO and Showtime and the circulation of bootleg VHS copies at comic book conventions booths (with Ralph Bakshi named as director). In 2005, Unearthed Films released a special 2-disc edition DVD of the film.

The song was released in 1994 as part of the single ""Heart"". In 1995, Hayao Miyazaki wrote and directed the short film for the song as a side-project after having writer's block with Princess Mononoke. The anime music video is non-linear, providing multiple reiterations and alternate scenes to depict the events. The music video added sound effects to the audio track, but contains no dialogue. Miyazaki purposely misinterpreted the lyrics to present his vision of a world where the surface becomes inhospitable and humans live in an underground city. Miyazaki purposely made the video cryptic to evoke creative interpretations among viewers.

BackgroundArt,2vb2pu,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Tue Feb 10 13:54:59 2015 UTC,"The cost of painting a 2D matte is a whole lot lower than modeling an entire 3D scene, especially with levels of detail like this. I know people will argue anything on reddit, but you can't possibly try to argue this."
BackgroundArt,2vb2pu,ZurinP,2,Tue Feb 10 17:44:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah the cost of modelling that, time wise and hardware wise would be a lot easier for a company.  Its a smart way of doing it if you can plan out all your camera angles ahead of time honestly.  Its when you want to change a camera angle that it becomes an issue, 3D takes a LOT longer to setup (I know, its my job to do it) but once its setup its a lot more versatile, you can change lighting, easily add things like rain or snow without having to remake the entire image, plus changing textures etc, with 2D most of the time you have to repaint it. But if its well planned 2D from the start then theres very little back and forth required.   The larger issues are with animation, consider the sequences from such games where it'd seamlessly turn into an FMV sequence, that was possible because the gameplay scene was the same first frame from the animation sequence, doing that with 2D would just require hand animating stuff, which isn't difficult for pro's but still is time consuming and can be expensive depending on the detail level and animation quality, plus you couldn't go back and edit it without completely redoing it.  Though even with 2D someone still has to go ahead and create scene depth and collision objects in 3D, there are ways to do this from a 2D image however, its not as difficult as it'd sound.  1 common way is that theres a 3d blockout made first, that way all the collisions and everything are already done right, as is the camera depth, then once the final camera angles are decided someone can paint them up.  Regardless its still cheaper, but its not always necessarily so, due to the back and forths sometimes required.  Interesting thing to note is games like Chrono Cross, FFVII,VIII & IX all used a combination of the 2, matt paintings were mostly for distant stuff, and sometimes simply touching something up that would be slower to edit in 3D (ie closing a window to a building would require days of rerendering back then, wheras 2 hours painting over the render is much more cost effective).  As someone who's currently experimenting with a project thats using these methods I've spent a lot of time testing various ways of reaching the same result.  This is what I meant when I say you're not wrong, but not 100% right either. It wasn't me saying 'oh lol some guys being stupid online, better shoot him down', nothing like that at all, I respect your opinion and was simply curious about it."

Crono noted that it could cross space and time and unify people's thoughts and feelings; transfer memories; draw on the sounds of the six colored Elements to produce a healing harmony, and combine the sounds of the world into one melody   Basicly it was the lost, last gem that was needed to bring harmony to the multiple dimensions in the wake of the Devourer's feeding. They could utilize it's power to finally destroy the Time Devourer from all realities by separating him and Schala. Without that anchor he's cast into what is basically oblivion. The use of it in such a profound way and merging the two dimensions resulted in it's destruction, but it served it's function by bringing harmony."

BackgroundArt,2vb2pu,SteroidSandwich,2,Tue Feb 10 14:52:03 2015 UTC,"It's sole  use is against the Time Devourer to get one of the good ending. The 'best and true' ending technically, since it's the namesake of the game. Basicly to use it you have to find the combination at the top of Terra tower then use that color order then active the Chrono Cross. It would then cause the seperation of the two entities and casts Lavos into nothingness, hopefully forever.  Beyond that, it's a mystery. Noone knows where it came from nor where it went off to after it was used. Nor the origin of it's power. We do know it's sentient and once 'awakened' it can just rewrite history however it pleases for the best outcomes thus creating 'harmony'. Keep in mind it doesnt create a utopic, happy world but one where the CT/CC/Lavos stuff is resolved and ended for eternity (hopefully - Schala is a rogue factor that could be used for a sequel)  (there are 12 different endings)   Chrono Cross Ending If the Chrono Cross is used to defeat the Time Devourer, Schala will break free and quote a long speech concerning the struggle of evolving organisms against each other. She then tells Serge that she will find him someday; he awakes on Opassa Beach, where he seemingly loses his memory. This is a point of interest, and analysis on it can be found in the Theory section.   and   More Theories on what the heck was going on; I miss complex JRPGs like CT/CC   The Unification Fixes Things?  This causes a myriad of questions and effects. Wazuki would be precluded from continuing his life, and would instead by replaced through Time Bastard by his later self as Lynx. Harle would also exist once more, and would conceivably be free to live on her own until the time the Dragon God returned to the Darkness Beyond Time after being defeated by Serge atop Terra Tower. This would cause each Dragon God to disappear to the DBT, including Harle, who originated from that area. In the future, Kid would be replaced by her old self, resulting in a loss of all Kid and Serge achieved while traveling together. And this does not even attempt to take into account the Schala / Kid merging inquiry, which appears later in this article. If anything, these cases are supported by the ending in that it appears exactly how Serge left it before Chrono Cross. The two converse on the beach just as they did before, which suggests the old history (with Lynx and the other sorrows) still exists.  Considering that the above framework would not only ruin Wazuki's life again, but would also result in the Chrono Cross Kid's nullification through Time Bastard, it appears harsh and unfit for the ending of the game. This suggests that the Time Crash Shift theory may be bunk. However, it is very possible that the unification of the dimensions simply changed things and rewrote history sufficiently to nullify these time travel effects. Chronopolis's effects would still be felt, as El Nido would still be founded, but any traveling following the split would be simply tossed out and the affected parties would be free to live their lives. Wazuki might not turn into Lynx; Lucca's orphanage would not be burned, and Harle may or may not exist at all. On top of all these complications, Time Traveler's Immunity and Time Bastard also function for dimensional travel. If Serge took Home Van across the dimensions, then in the Ideal Timeline, is the new Van replaced at some point in 1020 A.D. by this Time Bastard-protected person? Are we really going to negate this ideal, dual-existence fused new person to preserve the dimensional bastard? This needlessly complicates things further, making the idea that the dimensional unification smoothed everything over.  Summarily, at present, it is impossible to precisely gauge the nature of the Ideal Timeline. Ideally, people would be free to live independently of past actions and cases of time travel. Further elaboration (perhaps in a new Chrono game) is needed to pin down what does and doesn't happen. The fundamental question will also have to be addressed by the game -- that is, if Chronopolis isn't required to come back in time, why does El Nido still exist? Hopefully more information will be made available in the future.  A Proposed Timeline  This timeline represents what may happen in the Ideal Timeline. Since virtually no information exists on the ending of the game, this is not necessarily canon information:  From the perspective of the time-line, once Serge defeats the Time Devourer, it is as if it never existed. When Belthasar warps from Zeal to the new timeline, he does not discover that Schala had been absorbed by the TD, and he does not start Project Kid.  *In 2400 A.D., FATE and Chronopolis were never built, the Frozen Flame lays dead on the bottom of the ocean, and the counter-time experiment does not take place. Lavos does not create a temporal distortion connecting Chronopolis to 10,000 years in the past, and the planet does not do the same for Dinopolis from the Reptite dimension.  *In 12,000 B.C., Chronopolis and Dinopolis possibly fight due to a Gate effect, but it is probably unlikely. Because the temporal distortion surrounding Chronopolis acts like a Gate, Chronopolis' residents appear in the Sea of Eden due to TTI and begin to terraform and colonize El Nido as if FATE and Chronopolis still existed. The same goes for Dinopolis, meaning Elements still might be developed.   *In 2400 A.D., the people who would have worked at Chronopolis mysteriously dissappear due to Time Bastard. The Records of FATE never work, except perhaps according to preprogrammed instructions. Elements may or may not have be developed.  *Serge is born in 1003 A.D.  *Schala does not create Kid, but she may appear in 1004 A.D. due to TTI.  *Whatever happened to Guardia in 1005 A.D. hopefully doesn't occur.  *In 1006 A.D., Schala does not create a magnetic storm, and Serge does not go to Chronopolis. Wazuki does not become Lynx and Miguel is not imprisoned in the Dead Sea.  *In 1010 A.D., Wazuki does not attack Serge and he does not drown. The dimensional split does not occur.  *In 1015 A.D., Lynx does not attack Lucca's Orphanage (if it exists) or abduct Lucca. Kid probably still becomes a Radical Dreamer, if just by choice alone, based on a cutscene at the ending depicting her in her thief clothes sailing on the sea.  *In 1020 A.D., the new version of Serge disappears due to Time Bastard. The original version of Serge (protected by TTI from warping to the DBT) is sent to Opassa Beach by Schala. Serge's dimension crossing adventure does not occur. What happens to Schala and/or Kid is covered below. (see here)  Keep in mind that this timeline represents an ideal situation."

BackgroundArt,2tycdl,alicesutaren,1 point,Fri Feb 13 01:10:42 2015 UTC,"Taiwan under Japanese rule:       Between 1895 and 1945, Taiwan (including the Pescadores) was a dependency of the Empire of Japan, after Qing China lost the First Sino-Japanese War to Japan and ceded Taiwan Province in the Treaty of Shimonoseki. The short-lived Republic of Formosa resistance movement ended to no avail when it was suppressed by the Japanese troops. The fall of Tainan ended organized resistance to Japanese occupation, and inaugurated five decades of Japanese rule.  The annexation and incorporation of Taiwan into the Japanese Empire can be viewed as first steps in implementing their “Southern Expansion Doctrine” of the late 19th century. As Taiwan was Japan's first overseas colony, Japanese intentions were to turn the island into a showpiece ""model colony"".  As a result, much effort was made to improve the island's economy, industry, public works and to change its culture for much of the necessities of the war machine of Japanese military aggression in the Asia-Pacific until the surrender of Japan.  In 1945, after the defeat of the Empire of Japan in World War II, Taiwan was placed under the control of the Republic of China (ROC) with the signing of the Instrument of Surrender as a part of surrender ceremonies throughout the Asia-Pacific theater.  The experience of Japanese rule, ROC rule, and the 228 Incident (1947) continues to affect issues such as Taiwan Retrocession Day, national identity, ethnic identity and the Taiwan independence movement.

Eager to watch the whole movie!!  Mmm.. questions, questions..   How long was the production? How long did you work there? How many people worked on it? was it done in just one studio? Did the enjoy working on it? What about time and deadlines? Did you have feedback from Tomm Moore, or from an art/background supervisor? if the first case, what could you tell about Tomm?   Specific to your work:   What did you specifically do? did you also start working on the layout, or just coloring and final art? Did you have many changes and revisions, or was is straightforward? Did you have to output each background in many layers for composers to work with, or were they usually flattened? Did you liked/enjoyed working on this style? How long did you have to work on one background? How many backgrounds did you do? I assume you worked with Photoshop.. what resolution did you use? 8bits or 16bits color depth? Which program did they use for the animation? and composition? Do you have a portfolio website?   I'm very happy that there's also room for 'alternative' animated films. Kudos to Tomm Moore and everyone who support him.  Again, congratulations for your work, and for the nomination :)  and thanks in advance for the answers!"
BackgroundArt,2tjojs,dgoberna,10,Sat Jan 24 22:08:04 2015 UTC,"yeah, go and watch it! :D The films facebook page has the screening dates for the US and Canada. To your multifarious questions: * I still work for the Saloon, but Song was my first job with them so I don't know what it was like there for the years before I arrived. I was on Song for a full year. I think the whole production took about four years, with varying degrees of business up until about 2012/13 when it was just full-on. * I have no idea how many people worked on it. Have a look at the films wiki page and see the ""Production Company"" list on the right. That's what it takes to get independent films made. In effect, that meant the film was made in Ireland, Denmark, Luxembourg and Belgium. The key backgrounds were done in Ireland and the rest by Studio352 in Luxembourg. Nørlum in Denmark did a lot of animation. 352 did some animation too, and the compositing and final mix was done by Digital Graphics in Belgium. * I can honestly say it's the best job I've had. I was going off on a tangent here about badly-run projects ending up with people working crazy hours and sleeping at their desk etc etc. but I deleted it. Nobody wants to read my ranting about that stuff. Basically, this project was really well-managed and, for me, it was pretty much plain sailing. The quotas were fair so it was never very stressful. I was getting about two bgs done per week. * Yep, I had constant feedback from the art director Adrien Merigeau and occasionally from Tomm. I was working more closely with Tomm when I was working on the scene planning. I don't really know what to say about him. He's been interviewed often enough and the real Tomm is no different to interview Tomm :) eg animation round table.       Part 2: * The chain was Storyboard > Layout > Background. Initially, the background task was divided into line art and colour, but that distinction became blurred and I ended up doing both. The layout artists would take the rough, scribbled storyboards and compose the background with the films partly flat/partly deep style of perspective. Then that would be given to the pose animation team and the background team. The layout was just a greyscale, digital sketch so the first job as bg artist was to do the line-art (real pen on real paper) and get that approved. Then I'd use watercolours to do a rough painting. This was mostly wet in wet so none of the boundaries were solid but that, underlaid beneath the very tight line-art in Photoshop, was a lovely combination. Then the rest was digital painting and utilising scanned watercolour textures and altering the line colour and so on. Effectively the backgrounds are about 50/50 traditional and digital. * Yep. Loads of revisions. Getting to grips with somebody elses style takes time and, of course, you won't nail every bg first time. I will say that working with Adrien was great. He and Tomm both had a clear idea in their head about what's good (for the film) and what isn't. A director doesn't have to have all the answers up front, but they do need to know, for sure, the difference between something that works and something that doesn't. Adrien was so easy to talk to. Easy-going but with a clear idea of what he wanted. It made it very easy to take and apply the notes I got from him. * Yeah, quite a few overlays and underlays. It would be clear from the animatic what was needed (ie. a character walking behind something) and then we'd also give anything that should be animated as a separate layer. eg. clouds, a tree that needs to sway in the wind, etc. * I loved it. It took a bit of getting used to, of course. When you're learning layout/background art you'll often be taught to avoid tangents so it becomes second nature. On this film, we actively made them happen. It has a unique depth which took me a while to figure out. * I don't know how many I did in total. I would get about two done per week. Because I was working on scene planning too, I ended up doing a lot of the backgrounds that were not strictly one background painting. Things like multi-plane pans that required painting lots of different levels to be moved in comp. They could take a while but they would also be used in different shots in the same sequence (eg. the drive to the city) * Nothing fancy as far as photoshop goes. Just 8 bit. 16.8 million colours is plenty. The animation was done in TVPaint but I don't know what the comp software was. Sorry. * Well, kind of. I don't want this to be some sort of self-plug thing so I'll just link you to my tumblr of paintings. The theme isn't very nice. I need to sort that out but tumblr is so awkward to work with.     Anyway, I hope I've answered your questions well enough. Thanks for asking :)"

I was able to meet Tomm Moore at CTNX at the signing for Kells' art of book, and he told me that for Song of the Sea, they'd ""fixed all the issues"" that Kells had.  Any insight into what issues he was talking about?  I wanted to keep talking to him about it, but didn't want to be a jerk and hold up the line."
BackgroundArt,2tjojs,avxera,3,Sun Jan 25 05:13:22 2015 UTC,"I can only guess but I think the main concern was that Kells placed so much emphasis on shape and creating images that chimed with the actual Book of Kells and its Insular illumination style, so that may have got in the way of the actual story-telling. So, you could say, the lesson learned was ""story first, art second"" but, actually, they're both important to conveying a mood and a message. I just think Song has a better balance. Isn't the Kells book lovely, though? :) Amazing art in there."
BackgroundArt,2tjojs,avxera,1 point,Sun Jan 25 14:19:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes sense.  I just never really thought of the story as lacking, you know?  And yes, the book is fantastic.  One of my favorites in my collection.  What other projects have you worked on?  Were you on Kells?"

Quick question though: I feel that some shots in the trailer reminds me of Japan's Studio Ghibli's movies (and at times have a Ghibli-quality to it). I'm not sure of it, but did the background artists on this film draw inspirations from Ghibli?"
BackgroundArt,2tjojs,dgoberna,5,Sun Jan 25 06:03:21 2015 UTC,"Not really. It's not particularly helpful to be inspired by another animated film. You'll end up just repeating their work. The Ghibli association is bound to happen, I suppose. They make such beautiful films but, really, there's a tendency to see anything 2D on painted backgrounds as being Ghibli-eqsue purely because it's not 3D. Tomm is a big fan of Miyazaki so there probably is a strong influence there, but there was no particular inspiration on the art director and the bg artists from Ghibli films.      edit: I don't mean to suggest that you were making a lazy association. I just mean that the Ghibli films tend to be very well-known, widely distributed and are masterpieces of non-digital animation so everybody is in their shadow a little bit whether they like it or not :)"

The show starts out innocent and unassuming, but it eventually lays the foundation for a pretty dark backstory.  Multidimensional, colorful characters.  Feels. Feels all around. Dread, love, trust, betrayal, bittersweet memories, the whole shebang.  Breaks barriers for a kid's show, much like LoK. Deals with lots of real life problems by using fantasy situations as metaphors.(really well done, too.)  Humor isn't forced.(unlike some shows)  Always a good watch if you need a pick-me-up.  CONS:  Fanbase can sometimes be obnoxious.(I'm guessing you've noticed this)  Can sometimes feel like it's ripping off of AT(this is mostly due to parallels in characters, however the atmosphere of the show is completely different. Also, the show's creator used to work on AT, so it's likely she got some inspiration from it.)  Onion. He gets away with everything, and I mean everything.  In the end, though, you really have to watch Steven Universe to really understand what it's about. Watch a few episodes to get the gist, and if you like it, let me know."

The 13th in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, the film was released in New York City and London on July 26, 1951. The film features the voices of Kathryn Beaumont (who later voiced Wendy Darling in the 1953 Disney film Peter Pan) as Alice, and Ed Wynn as the Mad Hatter. The theme song, ""Alice in Wonderland"", has since become a jazz standard. While the film was critically panned on its initial release, the movie proved to be ahead of its time and has since been regarded as one of Disney's greatest animated classics, as well as one of the best film adaptations of Lewis Carroll's novel.

You could use the wiki pages on this sub-reddit to categorise images such that all the links to the images or albums for a series/franchise are on one page.  That could be quite tedious for someone to do, but a bot with using the wiki api might be able to do it. A problem to overcome with this would be linking names like ""Children who Chase lost voices"" and ""Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo"" together"

""If you listen closely"") is a 1995 Japanese animated drama film directed by Yoshifumi Kondō and written by Hayao Miyazaki based on the 1989 manga of the same name by Aoi Hiiragi. The film stars Yoko Honna, Issei Takahashi, Takashi Tachibana, Shigeru Muroi, Shigeru Tsuyuguchi and Keiju Kobayashi. It was the first theatrical Studio Ghibli film to be directed by someone other than Miyazaki or Isao Takahata.  Whisper of the Heart was Kondō's only film as director before his death in 1998. Studio Ghibli had hoped that Kondō would become the successor to Miyazaki and Takahata.   A semi-spin-off film entitled The Cat Returns that focused on a minor character of the film, Baron, was released in 2002.

BackgroundArt,2pd48v,Schwarzwind,1 point,Tue Dec 16 05:07:49 2014 UTC,I think I've grown to even prefer Makoto Shinkai over Miyazaki. And that's saying something.
BackgroundArt,2pd48v,qbahamutp,2,Mon Dec 15 22:57:30 2014 UTC,"I think they're hard to compare. Miyazaki's works tend to have a more whimsical nature, even when serious, that makes them great for all ages. Shinkai's work tends to stay more serious and focused, giving a more cohesive emotional punch but making them less relatable for younger audiences. Even Miyazaki's more serious films (Mononoke, Nausicaa, The Wind Rises) still have a storybook feel. They're tidy and direct. Shinkai's most Miyazakiesque film, Children Who Chase Lost Voices, is much darker than the standard Miyazaki with the possible exception of Nausicaa if you count the manga.   To compare their genres, Miyakai's films tend to be more shounen or shoujo, if unconventional within those genre. Shinkai's work falls in the territory of seinen."

BackgroundArt,2iok46,inkfish_,2,Wed Oct 8 20:07:58 2014 UTC,I think there might be so much open space because its heavily influenced by manga/comic compositions.

Originally a Chinese military fort, the Walled City became an enclave after the New Territories were leased to Britain in 1898. Its population increased dramatically following the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong during World War II. In 1987, the Walled City contained 33,000 residents within its 2.6-hectare (0.010 sq mi) borders. From the 1950s to the 1970s, it was controlled by Triads and had high rates of prostitution, gambling, and drug use.

The two surviving paintings depict the construction of the Tower of Babel, which according to the Book of Genesis in the Bible, was a tower built by a unified, monolingual humanity as a mark of their achievement and to prevent them from scattering: ""Then they said, 'Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.'""

Everyone working on this did probably some of the best work they'll ever do and it really comes down to just how the art perfectly matched the show and all the awe inspiring atmospheres have really become the trademark vision for batman and his beloved gotham

BackgroundArt,2gl53w,colacube,3,Tue Sep 16 19:14:45 2014 UTC,"Fascinating.  For those who don't know (and had to look it up like myself), the light study defines the depth of tone. Tone is best observed in greyscale which is why it is in black and white.  In digital painting you can add in color to greyscale painting fairly easily without having to repaint anything. Added color + light study = Color Key. The color key is just a way to do a mock up of what the overall palette will be.  Once you have that, you go back and refine the linework and add in the color you determined with the color key."

BackgroundArt,2g1e69,Vwyx,2,Thu Sep 11 02:34:48 2014 UTC,"Mind giving me a summary of sorts? Specially about the ending, I'm wondering if I should spend time watching it (I've been very tight on time lately)."
BackgroundArt,2g1e69,PieroDrawsRandomCrap,10,Thu Sep 11 03:47:51 2014 UTC,"It's about 3 boys, all with profound issues. The characters are the big thing, here. The main character was kidnapped at a young age, along with his older sister. He survived, his sister didn't. He meets a cocky transfer student who bullied a kid at his older school to suicide, leaving a note blaming him. The main character's cousin's parents killed themselves. All three have clear post-traumatic stress disorder, and the show is fairly realistic about its effects on their lives.  The series also explores concepts related to parapsychology, and most of the main characters experience some kind of paranormal phenomenon; the three main characters all develop the ability to project their consciousnesses out of their bodies, one character has an experience with a UFO that is strongly implied to be a result of a brain deformity or tumor, another was a part of a (real life) trial where electric stimulation to the brain triggered a religious experience.   The series has a weird pace, but the focus is on the main character's search to find out exactly what happened to his sister, the strange happenings in the world the characters can project themselves into, what exactly a local research company's insane politics are about, the cult that the third kid's family seems to run, and what happened in the past of the town that nobody wants to talk about.  The ending... well, it's not quite Evangelion, but it's not all that far off, either. If you want to watch it, don't read this next bit, but the ending involves spoiler  I would cautiously recommend it. It's a bit confusing, and the spotty pacing and odd concepts could easily have you screaming at your monitor. That said, it's a fun little suspense tale nobody's heard of, and it's frigging beautiful.  If you wind up watching it, please let me know what you think. It's been about 7 years or so since I watched it, but it did leave an impression on me, and it interested me in psychology enough that I wound up making it my college major."

And as soon as I'm done I'll be sure to send you a PM, most likely asking what the hell I just saw (some subtle nuances tend to fly way ahead of me when watching anime, I guess I'm not used to most cultural quirks from Japan).   Thanks again mate."

BackgroundArt,2fxtag,erfrischungsgetraenk,10,Tue Sep 9 20:15:52 2014 UTC,the absolute best miyazaki movie imo  can watch it over and over and still be amazed by the whole thing
BackgroundArt,2fxtag,Celorfiwyn,7,Tue Sep 9 20:57:12 2014 UTC,"Agreed. I watched it for the first time as a toddler and it made such a strong impression in me that I used to have dreams about it during all of my childhood and part of my teenage years. I reached a point where I believed the movie was just a recurrent dream, then I found about Miyazaki and did my research until I found it. To this day this is my favorite movie and I doubt I'll ever watch another one that lives up to it."
BackgroundArt,2fxtag,PieroDrawsRandomCrap,5,Tue Sep 9 21:17:49 2014 UTC,"Snap. I saw Nausicaa before this (I still have the VHS tape), and I saw Laputa on the telly in the 80's...and that was it. Didnt see it again until 2006. For the longest time, I thought it was a dream I had as well."
BackgroundArt,2fxtag,TheIrateGlaswegian,8,Wed Sep 10 01:03:52 2014 UTC,"It's crazy how magical these movies can be, they're amazing quality animation and the storytelling is brilliant but there's something else about them, they have that weird feel to them, that feel that tells you this could be ""real"", you're watching a cartoon alright but sometimes you start to believe it in a weird way, you know it's fantasy but this could be a dream. I have no fucking clue how to explain it without sounding mental. I do believe this has a lot to do with the backgrounds."

BackgroundArt,2djlfg,princethegrymreaper,1 point,Sat Aug 16 04:00:12 2014 UTC,"Yeah thanks for that, wasn't condescending at all...  Honestly I've seen 2 episodes of Psycho pass, episode 1 (which I could say yes definitely has cyber punk feels) and episode 2 (which aside from the gun the character uses at one point, nothings really cyber punk IMHO,).  If I give cyberpunk a google it seems to be more or less what I think it is, neon lights, cool looking outfits and the like, accessories that serve little purpose but look really cool.  The show has all this sci-fi stuff, undoubtedly, though I struggle with the boarder between whats sci-fi and whats cyber punk. Something like Ghost in the Shell I'd say has cyberpunk elements but in other aspects its just standard sci-fi.  I'm far from a cyberpunk expert though, I think a lot of its rather interesting but I don't know all that much about it."

At least you admit you're completely clueless to what cyberpunk is. It's a bit more forgivable knowing you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about at all in the slightest.

BackgroundArt,2bjh7a,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Wed Jul 23 22:40:31 2014 UTC,"Usually I snap a million backgrounds and my albums are pretty large, figured I should start trimming the fat, though the main reason this set of backgrounds, totalling 6 episodes only wound up as 5 images is simply because there were no good backgrounds worth keeping, nothing bad, just sort of bland due to the school setting."
BackgroundArt,2bdtiz,Dan_Tsukasa,8,Tue Jul 22 10:37:07 2014 UTC,"This album totals at 53 backgrounds from the game Boku no Natsuyasumi (My summer vacation), there are 1 or 2 duplicates in here, I kept them because some are morning and some are around sunset, so the colours are a little different and I couldn't decide what I liked more.  The game uses 2d backgrounds and 3D characters, it might look sometimes like its 3d but all this work is fully 2d. For anyone wondering how they did it, they created the environments in 3d first, chose the camera angles and then completely painted over the renders, using them only for scale, reference and camera angle.  Anyone wondering if I can get this in a higher res, nope, its a PS2 game afterall, the resolution is low, I rendered them in HD in PCSX2 with antialising plus all the whistles and bells for upscaling and this is as good as they get, any higher the quality drops quite considerably.  Story: So, after noticing a few other people on this sub really wanted to view backgrounds from this game, and also that I really wanted to play this, I finally managed to get ahold of all the Boku games.  Sadly this is the only PS2 one so its the only one with a good resolution, the PSP games are, well, PSP, so the resolution is pretty damned low so I don't think I'll be able to get anything from them.  I've also got an album of just the night-time backgrounds, which tbh I prefer to the daytime ones for the most part, but I've not finished editing characters and models out of these."

Though I have to disagree it looks like Ghibli stuff, a few shots (the rocks for example) might do, but for the most part this looks like anime backgrounds from the early 00's and before, very similar to Kamichu! or the Tenchi series and movies , Miyazaki was already a big name back then but a lot of anime had this look.  I think Ghibli has a 'style' but it changes a lot between their films, for example Ponyo background wise is drastically different to castle in the sky, mostly in their character designs that Ghibli always stay more or less the same (exception of Mononoke though, sad as I think Ghibli characters are too samey).  I have this knee-jerk reaction to when people say stuff looks like Ghibli, back when I posted my game Kodama on kickstarter every response was 'omg looks like Ghibli' so now my auto-response has become 'no, no it doesnt'. I can see some similarities here of course."

BackgroundArt,29jzec,randomataxia,5,Tue Jul 1 14:54:45 2014 UTC,"The game is great if you ask me. Ni No Kuni was the first game in a long time that gave me that sense of childish fun while playing it. Everything from how the game looked to decoding all of the ancient language in game using the key in the back of the manual was just awesome. Its kind of like pokemon in that you fight using captured creatures but unlike pokemon it isnt really turn based combat. Also a lot of people complain that the game holds your hand too much and is too easy, but honestly that never really bothered me. I would say that if you are a fan of either rpgs or studio ghibli it is a must play, but that is just my opinion"
BackgroundArt,29jzec,randomataxia,2,Tue Jul 1 15:47:59 2014 UTC,"It's great and I don't regret buying it at launch, but it carried a great sense of ""meh"" as I went through it:  I love(d) JRPGs, but as a grown man I don't have the time or patience to sit through grinding or filler material in games. The game has plenty of both but that's a non issue for the fans of genre.   It doesn't manage to be as epic as it aims to be, Areas and plot elements are shallow and not engaging as they could have been. There are plenty of big events in the game but the sense of adventure isn't really there.  Animated cut scenes dwindles really quickly (note how the OP mentions the 1st hour of the game) and even the pre rendered stuff are a rare sight.    Characters are flat and uninteresting, aside from Drippy, your fairy companion. Oscar himself is a cute kid but he doesn't do or say anything dramatic.  Combat has nice systems but are not well executed, your team AI is pretty bad and burns through their mana pool in seconds. Running through menus in real time doesn't clash well with the short response time you usually get (you get basic global commands eventually but its way to far into the game).  The pokemon element serves a huge part of the game and is pretty well done all around. expect when you try to complete specific quests that demand you tame very specific monsters who have absurdly low encounter and capture rate.  My automatic comparison is with FFIX which is a huge compliment for Ni No Kuni, they are a bit similar in presentation and feel, but IX does everything better.  The game is basically a port from the much weaker DS; it shows, as it doesn't live to its true potential."

BackgroundArt,29jzec,andrzejellis,1 point,Tue Jul 1 22:39:35 2014 UTC,"For those asking about the quality of the game, I'm only 1 hour in, have had a total of 10 random battles so far so its difficult to say, but so far my impressions aren't so great.  Its very hand holdy, and not even in a good way, its ver much in a 'babys first RPG' sort of way, telling me how to access the pause menu, how to access the item menu and so on, all these things that honestly should be accessible from the start not be 'unlocked', and especially not unlocked with a pop up screen where I can't skip for roughly 3 seconds because a little melody is playing to celebrate my victory for unlocking the main menu from a tutorial.  The game begins very slow, no character building (bar the event that kicks the game off for real), the voice acting (in English) is sub-par, the boys voice is terrible, and for some reason they though it smart for his mother, and all other inhabitants of this tiny town, to have entirely different accents from all over the world. Drippy, the little companion you have, is voiced very well however.  Once the game gets going for real it gets better, the world map is lovely, and I say this as someone who's been playing JRPGS for roughly 20 years now, the combat seems simple enough but I expect its going to get some upgrades as I learn more things and begin new unwanted and time wasting tutorials.  From the perspective of the average gamer is probably very well done, nicely paced and everything, but from the perspective of a game developer, its too hand holdy so far and treats the player like a child, the game design is outright bad so far, with only the combat standing out as above average.  This all said, I'm an hour in, so its difficult to judge the entire game based on the first hour, I'll be posting screencaps from the cutscenes whilst I go, I've been a tad busy which is why I've not posted Mushishi episode 10 just yet."

BackgroundArt,295kbx,TagSmile,1 point,Fri Jun 27 00:48:35 2014 UTC,"the background art in these games is great, the only downside is they seemed to remake the same 2-3 games over and over and over and over for each new console, sometimes doing a mixup of the stages from various games."

BackgroundArt,295kbx,imkrut,1 point,Sun Jul 6 07:13:48 2014 UTC,"So they've managed to make 12 games in total (8 from the main series and several ports) and each of those is an entirely original game, as I'm sure they contain mostly the exact same backgrounds."
BackgroundArt,295kbx,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Sun Jul 6 09:47:39 2014 UTC,"I don't know where you are getting 12 from, to my knowledge there are 7 main games (ordered by their numeral) with X being a revised version of 2 and XX a revised version of 7 (which came out for the Nintendo DS), ports and spinoffs i really wouldn't count them into the main series.  Anyway, as far as i'm aware (i've played them all at one point) i don't recall repeat background art (of course jungle theme is gonna look similar between games tho).  The animations on the spritework are abolutely bonkers, i recommend people checking it out if you haven't already."
BackgroundArt,295kbx,imkrut,1 point,Sun Jul 6 10:38:14 2014 UTC,"I've always been amazed by the spritework details in the games.  There are 7 main games yeah, with the rest being remakes or spinoffs, I just remember everyone I've known who's had one of the games I see the same areas, its possible they all had 2, X XX or 7, the rest likely just being ports of those same games knowing my luck."
BackgroundArt,295kbx,Dan_Tsukasa,2,Sun Jul 6 12:06:56 2014 UTC,"You should really give 3 a chance. In my opinion is the very best of the series, it amazing how much variety it offers in terms of scenery and mechanics while maintaining the simple original concept.  For example level 3 (i think) is a zombie invasion that slowly starts to take over people and the enemy army, if you get hit by a zombie unit (which would result in dead normally) you turn into a zombie yourself with limited movespeed/jump but a huge vomit bomb.  Stages are filled with secret passages too, so in that same stage you can start shooting a huge boulder that blocks a cave to enter it to a ice cave filled with sasquatch like creatures!  You can find it on Steam super cheap (like 3 bucks while on sale) or just use emulators i guess, either way it's a great game and the animations are truly one of the finests to ever grace 2D gaming."

Surely if you can fit 1080 pixels on a tiny screen, and a TV is like 12 times the size a TV should be like 12k or something. Its not like pixels get smaller and larger, and its not as though TV's have huge gaps between the pixels either so I sort of wonder how it works."

Hopefully I can keep it up for the rest of the episodes. The only problem is that uploading to imgur reduces the quality a little bit.

We had to choose from a list of films to discuss.  I knew nothing about Grave of the Fireflies, but I saw that it was an anime and was done by Studio Ghibli, so I volunteered to watch and analyze it, thinking it'd be a cheery, cute, and fun movie.  Oh god.  Oh my god.  I had to watch it three times... those three days showed me that joy is life's cruel joke.  Misery is the only reality.  After the third viewing, I had to watch My Neighbor Totoro just to shake off the shackles of sadness.  TL;DR This movie is really sad, but it's good and if you haven't seen it, you should watch it.  EDIT: I should've italicized ""My Neighbor Totoro"" before.  Fixed that."

BackgroundArt,27noy1,Ammonum_MB,2,Mon Jun 9 11:37:07 2014 UTC,"I'm feeling brave and honest today so here we go. I'd always been told to avoid the movie as it will cause me to break down. I'm a pretty sensitive person and have dealt with the loss of parents and war so I was half afraid of triggering some kind of relapse or pulling up painful memories but after a particularly hard week at school, I wanted to feel. I turned it on, watched it all the way through (with subtitles because that's the only way to watch anime) and didn't shed a tear. Nothing. I just couldn't get over how selfish and lazy the brother was. Yes his mom was killed and they lost everything and had to go to a new place to live, constantly under the threat of death from the bombers but come on!  He couldn't find a job or go to school or at least help out around his aunt's house?  She didn't come across as completely evil and hating them for coming to live with her family. Maybe if he did, his little sister wouldn't have starved to death in the dirt of a cave and he wouldn't have died from malnutrition in a train station."
BackgroundArt,27noy1,JRoch,6,Mon Jun 9 13:33:59 2014 UTC,"He is a kid himself, thrust into a horrible situation. I think thats the answer to that question. He tries to the best of his abilities and fails. You could say the same for his aunt, she should have never let them go. Or the farmer catching him, or the police officer. No one really assumes responsibility here, they all fail and stay selfish with their own problems.   Its not so much about the realism of the story i would assume, the film is more about the metaphor of what many children (and people) seemed to go thru in that time in japan."
BackgroundArt,27noy1,karakardan,2,Mon Jun 9 16:48:37 2014 UTC,Apparently many Japanese see it as two kids being selfish and stupid and getting what they deserve
BackgroundArt,27noy1,JRoch,1 point,Tue Jun 10 13:33:04 2014 UTC,"There were no jobs. Even if he had a job, nobody had food to give him in return for him working. I didn't remember him as selfish or lazy, he tried to do so much for his little sister.  Also, one point of the movie is that war changes people. War makes people selfish and cruel, because they are exposed to hardship beyond their cracking point.  I lived through a war and I consider myself tough and thick-skinned. This movie left me crying and bawling for hours. It's not hyperbole, I spent several hours crying and couldn't console myself. It struck a chord with me, because it described the experience the way life is: the terrible trauma can be interwoven with poetically sublime moments. This is the beauty of the film to me. I don't think I can bear to see it again, not for a long time.  I respect your reaction. As two people who have gone through seemingly similar things and reacted completely opposite to the movie, this is almost funny."

Please don't get me wrong, this art is incredible and you did a great job making the screenshots. BUT: There are WAY too many of them. I think I am not the only one who likes it when there is a limited amount of pictures uploaded to an album. Many people won't even look at it, because it takes much time. Also each picture becomes more precious, if there aren't so many to compare to. So maybe you could upload 15-30 pictures next time and if people like it, you can upload more of them later or give them a link to another album in the comments.  (And now I'm going back to learning for my exam tomorrow.)"

A sequel was intended to be released set 50 years later, but due to lack of funds, Gainax abandoned it part way through production; Toshio Okada cited a fundamental dissatisfaction with the script and plot. However, it has been recently announced that the sequel is in production once again.

They are neither plants nor animals. They differ from other forms of life such as the micro-organisms and the fungi. Instead they resemble the primeval body of life and are generally known as ""Mushi"". Their existence and appearance are unknown to many and only a limited number of humans are aware of them. Ginko is a ""Mushi-shi"" who travels around to investigate and find out more about the ""Mushi"". In the process, he also lends a helping hand to people who face problems with supernatural occurances which may be related to the ""Mushi"". (Copied and pasted from Anime news network).

These are from season 1 episodes 10-11 ""Close Encounters of the Rick Kind"" and ""Ricksy Business.""  A lot of the alien worlds have a kind of Dr. Suess-esque feel, I think.

Though it gives you a sense of what Yuki had to go through which gives Disappearance more oomph. Disappearance is the last one in the anime, but the light novels are still ongoing, which is the original.  There's also 2 other shorts-series, but only the haruhi-chan one is watchable. They're short episodes, 3-5 minutes, but some of them fills in the gap of their other adventures  If you want to continue looking at what happens next, check out the shorts and the light novels."

It follows vagrant schoolgirl Ryuko Matoi on her search for her father's killer, which brings her into violent conflict with the iron-fisted student council president of Honnouji Academy, Satsuki Kiryuin, and her mother's fashion empire.  The series is Trigger's first original television anime project, directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi and written by Kazuki Nakashima, both of whom had previously worked together on Gurren Lagann. The series aired in Japan between October 3, 2013 and March 27, 2014.  Aniplex of America has licensed the anime for a simulcast and a home video release.

Everything is empty because the characters are still undeveloped and ""empty"". Also because they're teenagers and don't really care about anything but their own issues, so only the teenagers actually appear. As the franchise has gone on, the environments have gained a warmer feeling to go along with the characters maturing. Non-main character humans even appear in Second Season (and note that Kaiki, the well-adjusted adult, freely interacts with other people, unlike the teens)."

""Heisei-era Raccoon Dog War Ponpoko"") is a 1994 Japanese animated fantasy film, the eighth written and directed by Isao Takahata and animated by Studio Ghibli.  Consistent with Japanese folklore, the tanuki (Japanese raccoon dogs, Nyctereutes procyonoides) are portrayed as a highly sociable, mischievous species, which are able to use ""illusion science"" to transform into almost anything, but too fun-loving and too fond of tasty treats to be a real threat – unlike the kitsune (foxes) and other shape-shifters. Visually, the tanuki in this film are depicted in three ways at various times: as realistic animals, as anthropomorphic animals which occasionally wear clothes, and as cartoony figures based on the manga of Shigeru Sugiura (of whom Takahata is a great fan). They tend to assume their realistic form when seen by humans, their cartoony form when they are doing something outlandish or whimsical, and their anthropomorphic form at all other times.  Prominent testicles are an integral part of tanuki folklore, and they are shown and referred to throughout the film, and also used frequently in their shape-shifting. This remains unchanged in the DVD release, though the English dub (but not the subtitles) refers to them as ""pouches"". Also, in the English dub and subtitles, the animals are never referred to as ""raccoon dogs"", which is the more accurate English name for the tanuki, instead they are incorrectly referred to as just ""raccoons"".

BackgroundArt,1uz2xz,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Jan 11 18:52:41 2014 UTC,"Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about The Jungle Book (1967 film) :      The Jungle Book is a 1967 American animated film produced by Walt Disney Productions and was released on October 18, 1967. It is the 19th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. It was inspired by the stories about the feral child Mowgli from the book of the same name by Rudyard Kipling. Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, it was the last to be produced by Walt Disney, who died during its production.  The early versions of both the screenplay and the soundtrack followed Kipling's work more closely, with a dramatic, dark, and sinister tone which Disney did not want in his family film, leading to writer Bill Peet and composer Terry Gilkyson being replaced. The casting employed famous actors and musicians Phil Harris, Sebastian Cabot, George Sanders and Louis Prima, as well as Disney regulars such as Sterling Holloway, J. Pat O'Malley and Verna Felton, and the director's son, Bruce Reitherman, as Mowgli. The Jungle Book was released to positive reception, with much acclaim to its soundtrack, featuring five songs by the Sherman Brothers and one by Gilkyson, ""The Bare Necessities"". The film grossed over $73 million in the United States in its first release, and as much again from two re-releases.  After the film's success, Disney later released a live-action remake and a theatrical sequel, The Jungle Book 2.     Picture  image source | about | /u/erfrischungsgetraenk can reply with 'delete'.

BackgroundArt,1sswwq,colacube,16,Fri Dec 13 16:18:34 2013 UTC,I would like to know how the fuck Shinkai does this. It is so incredibly superior to every other animation I have ever seen. How does he do that? And why is there no one else who does with this level of quality? It's not like he has tons of money and manpower to do that.
BackgroundArt,1sswwq,donatboy91,6,Fri Dec 13 17:04:20 2013 UTC,"A lot of the animation studios who does films like this (atleast in Japan) have been doing it the old way by physically drawing all the backgrounds and characters on paper and scanning it on a computer, while on Shinkai films they usually draw everything digital in Photoshop and also use a lot of 3D which gives them a bit more flexibilety in what they can do with lighting etc.   Worth mentioning that Shinkai seems very obsessed with shocasing lighting. All his films relies heavily on backlighting.   They also use a lot of photoreference for the locations, but this is fairly common to do."
BackgroundArt,1sswwq,anonymepelle,3,Sat Dec 21 19:28:07 2013 UTC,Doesn't he trace photographs? I got a book with one of his DVDs which documented his process and it relies heavily on pre-production photography.

BackgroundArt,1s8vgj,iraah9,15,Fri Dec 6 17:47:13 2013 UTC,Posting stills from 5 cm/s is like cheating in this sub.
BackgroundArt,1s8vgj,Smilotron,4,Fri Dec 6 19:46:12 2013 UTC,"I am intrigued, can anyone provide a brief synopsis of this film?"
BackgroundArt,1s8vgj,Southpawn,10,Fri Dec 6 19:29:36 2013 UTC,"It's about the one character at 3 different points in his life.  Part one as a preteen or early teenager (I don't quite know what age he is). Part two he has moved far away and is a young adult, but still in high school. Part three he is an adult living in Tokyo or some urban city type thing.    The plot of the movie is that he and this girl in part one used to be such good friends but drifted away from each other as their lives move forward, each time they get separated a bit more.  It's a pretty depressing movie, but also very beautiful."
BackgroundArt,1s8vgj,Smilotron,5,Fri Dec 6 19:45:27 2013 UTC,"It's also about how he can't move on and is stuck thinking about the girl, so can't appreciate any of the other possible relationships which are offered to him."
BackgroundArt,1s8vgj,iraah9,4,Sat Dec 7 01:54:24 2013 UTC,All of Makoto Shinkai's films have excellent background art.
BackgroundArt,1s8vgj,TachikomaS9,4,Fri Dec 6 20:08:51 2013 UTC,"The lightning, harmony and details in 5cm/s backgrounds make the whole thing gorgeous. I didn't think an anime could be that good looking before watching that. The amount of time that must have took...."
BackgroundArt,1s8vgj,Niveks,1 point,Fri Dec 6 22:40:58 2013 UTC,"Makoto Shinkai's films are really the epitomy of animation. Sometimes I feel his stories aren't tied together as well as they could be, but damn, the art gives it a whole new dimension that not only compensates but actively plays a role in creating emotion within the film. Brilliant. Just watched Garden of Words again, very good film."

Seriously though, a lot of the fighting games (until the 3D-in-a-2D-plane era) had incredible background art. Street Fighter 3, Vampire Savior, Guilty Gear, etc. have not only great backgrounds, but great sprites as well. Now that I think about it, not just 2-d fighting games have amazing art. Tekken has great stages (like Fallen Gardens). I guess because they have less area to focus on, the environments get a lot more detail."

""Oh no, guess I have to teach the kid about the magical pig after all.""  What was that supposed to be?  Foreshadowing?  This is why you shouldn't have 9 people write a script, it was a mess.    I really wanted to love the Black Cauldron.  I love Disney movies.  I love dark movies.  The idea of a dark, PG rated Disney movie had me salivating.  Add to that that B.C. was one of Disney's most ambitious films in terms of animation and I was certain that I would be a huge fan.  But the script and the cookie cutter characters just kill it for me.  Also Gurgi.  I wanted to strangle that little fucker."

The film itself was made in 1985, and was never released in the west. However, parts of it were incorporated into a strange hybrid live-action/animation film called ""In the Aftermath"", which was shown irregularly on late night British TV as a space-filler. That was my introduction to this masterpiece. I have sought more information on the animation itself over the years, and eventually found the entire film on Youtube.  Your opinion on the actual film may vary from mine, but you can't deny the beauty of the artwork, especially during the town scenes."
