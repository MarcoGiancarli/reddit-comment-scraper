I use one of these: http://www.jansport.com/shop/en/jansport-us/big-student-tdn7  It fits my washable pumping supplies and ice pack in a soft lunch box cooler, changing pad with a couple diapers and wipes, Little's 4 bottles, and the rest of my stuff (wallet, sunglasses, ipad, etc). It might be a tight fit if I was packing a big lunch for myself, but my hands are free to carry a separate bag if needed. I leave my actual pump and non-washable supplies at work in another bag."

babywearing,3e2z6y,KayThere12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:09:23 2015 UTC,"I feel a bit like a sherpa and have to watch out behind me so I don't knock into people with the backpack, but it's manageable on public transportation. I'm not sure what the solution is if you're going to wear the baby on your back, though. I think at that point I would bring an umbrella stroller if only to carry the stuff."
babywearing,3e2z6y,catsalots,2,Tue Jul 21 20:10:16 2015 UTC,"If you do get a rolling bag, make sure the places you go around are wheelchair accessible and the bag is waterproof unless it never rains or you don't have a problem with puddles.   I walked around campus in my second tri with one and it was SOOO annoying because I had to take the long way (around the edge of campus where I got to walk where everyone was smoking) and sometimes my school books and laptop got wet on the bottom. :/ I did put a garbage bag as a liner, but it was annoying to air it out every night (and me worry that it was going to leak through anyway).  I'm due at the end of the month, so I don't have experience with this yet, but am planning for something similar. I will be walking around campus with my LO that will be around 6-8 weeks old. I will have my school stuff, diaper bag, lunch, and will be baby wearing. Baby will be looked after during my classes, but besides that I get to have him with me and all my stuff.   I asked a similar question in this sub earlier, and everyone had good suggestions: https://www.reddit.com/r/babywearing/comments/3bj9xq/boken_diaper_bag_for_babywearing/  In the end I received the boken bag as a surprise gift from a friend, so that kind of made the decision for me. I'm not 100% sure what I will be putting my school stuff in as book sizes vary each term, so I'm just going to wait until I can at least get the syllabus...  I hope everything works out for you!"

babywearing,3e2z6y,dirtbooksun,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:08:39 2015 UTC,"Usually depending on whether I'm front carrying or back carrying, a knapsack or fanny-pack is enough to carry my essentials. For you though, maybe a wheely backpack is the way to go. You could put small items like wallet/keys/phone in a small crossbody purse while everything else goes in the backpack."

Forward facing out just isn't the most comfortable for either wearer or wearee, unfortunately.   Are there any babywearing groups in your area? It can be so helpful to be able to try on a variety of carriers, and many even have lending libraries. Infants that love to face out also usually enjoy high back carries so they can see over your shoulder, and I think you'd find that far more comfortable!"
babywearing,3dvc1j,Sinafey,2,Sun Jul 19 22:49:07 2015 UTC,"There are some more ergonomic front facing carriers.  Like baby, catbird baby, ergo 360 that are designed for front facing and have a waist strap which distributes the weight better on the wearer.  As long as you are comfortable and baby is comfortable Nd not at risk of hip dysplasia and you are in the weight range of the carrier you are OK.   If baby sits unassisted you might look into an ergonomic carrier that is safe for back carries  (this carry does not look to be designed for those) and do a hip or back carry."
babywearing,3dvc1j,dragonflylie,2,Mon Jul 20 16:51:30 2015 UTC,"If he likes facing forward so that he can see what's going on, you could look into a carrier that lets you put him on your back.  At six months, he should be ready for that."
babywearing,3dvc1j,merveilleuse_,3,Mon Jul 20 18:09:15 2015 UTC,Is there anyway you can get an Infantino mei tai? They're fairly adorable ($25) and you would be able to forward face with his legs still in the M positioning because it would be knee to knee. The article that in the post above has a great image at the bottom showing exactly what I mean.
babywearing,3dvc1j,MrsWhovian,0,Sun Jul 19 21:41:17 2015 UTC,"You actually can't face forward in a mei tai- any brand- unless you mean on your back, looking over your shoulder?"
babywearing,3dvc1j,merveilleuse_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:07:48 2015 UTC,"You physically can, although it's not generally recommended. It's definitely not ideal, but I imagine that if you have a child who only tolerates front carriers, forward facing, that the positioning in a mei tai would be favorable to that of a narrow based carrier. At least the child would still be in a knees-higher-than-bum position with less strain on their hip joints. It still probably wouldn't be comfortable for the wearer, but more comfortable for the baby being worn."
babywearing,3dvc1j,MrsWhovian,0,Tue Jul 21 01:05:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not really.  The baby doesn't end up in a knees higher than bum position, because there is nothing to support the knees.  If you front face a child in a mei tai, you are basically turning it into a narrow based carrier, the legs still dangle."

There is something to support the knees -- The very same fabric that would support the babies legs facing the opposite direction. As long as the fabric was spread from knee to knee and not bunched, the baby would have support. They don't dangle if the baby is properly positioned. Just like in an ergo 360 or other SSCs that allow forward facing, just in a much more affordable option."

babywearing,3dvc1j,shadeofmyheart,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:25:46 2015 UTC,"So you're probably gonna get a lot of crap about this being a bad carrier because of the dangly legs..  That being said, I have both kinds of carriers. A bjorn (crotch dangler) and also a beco (ergonomic for baby). Me and baby LOVE the bjorn because she loves to face out. I use it for short periods of time. Quick walks. Quick trips to a store. Yadda yadda. I got the beco for longer day trips, Costco trips and whatnot. Half an hour here and there in a bjorn isn't the end of the world."
babywearing,3dura7,iamvaginaandsocanyou,3,Sun Jul 19 17:52:56 2015 UTC,"Look on Craigslist or offerup for a beco butterfly two. It has an extra little panel between you and baby so you can slide them into back carry from the front and the panel keeps them secure from both sides. You can also 'pre-load' the baby in a chair or something and put them on similar to a backpack!  *they don't make this model anymore, I picked one up from Craigslist for 40 bucks! My girl is only 4 months so I haven't tried her on my back. YouTube has a videos showing how to slide front to back as well."
babywearing,3dura7,Ks26739,2,Sun Jul 19 19:25:45 2015 UTC,I found that tying under my boobs instead of at my waist helps a lot with hip pain.  My son is 2 and 24lbs. I carry him for hour long hikes and can only do it if I buckle or tie under my boobs. It gets him nice and high on my back as well.
babywearing,3dura7,Beamme_up,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:02:28 2015 UTC,"The last time I carried my daughter was on her 4th birthday. We were hiking and when she'd get tired she hopped into the Ergo for 10 -15 minutes to give her feet a break.   For older and heavier kids you definitely want to start practicing back carries. I can carry my 11 mo old in front for quite a while still,  but for longer outings we ate starting to put him on my back.   I have never owned a mei tai, so I can't advise what you can do with it,  but I find the Ergo I have good for quick up/down, especially on your back. I also have a woven wrap that I use for back carries, but I definitely want him to stay in there for a bit,  since it requires more careful wrapping."

babywearing,3dura7,allididwasdie,2,Sun Jul 19 18:15:18 2015 UTC,"I usually fasten and tighten the waist belt, then bend over and put baby on my back and pull the carrier over her back and slip my arms in the straps.

Our way in took a while getting through the entrance line so we probably wore them for 10 minutes, but felt fine when it came time to let them loose. When they were 2 we were wearing them for up to 3 hours at a time doing amusement parks and we're virtually pain free. When they turned a year old we treated ourselves to new SSC's. We got two Boba 3G's for a steal a dog haven't looked back. SSC's are excellent for toddlers, they seem comfy and the carrier gives the parent more support on the hips and lower back. We're not giving up our Boba's until the kids are honestly too big to carry. So far 3 years old is still okay with us."

It is all about having the right carrier or techniques I think.
babywearing,3dura7,bambiontheshore,2,Mon Jul 20 09:27:00 2015 UTC,"We still backcarry our 3.5yo in our ergo or Toddler tula. If you fancy getting yourself a buckle carrier, Tula and Ergo have instructions on how to back carry on their websites, they're both different and one might be easier for you. Also look into the superman lift (where you lift your child over your head onto your back) and the ""walk like an Egyptian"" back carry Video on YouTube (where you put your child in a front carry and then loosen the straps and basically spin the carrier from your front onto your back with baby already in it). With our mei tai I would pass my son onto my back underneath my arm and then lift the panel onto his bum with one hand and pull the straps over my shoulders with the other (swapping hands for each side)."

babywearing,3dfivp,unclegrassass,8,Wed Jul 15 21:35:13 2015 UTC,Cradle carries should only be used when actively nursing and those cheap pouch slings have been the cause of infant deaths. Keep trying the upright carries. Baby should be tummy to tummy with you. Is there a baby wearing meet up in your area you could go to and a lending library you could try some different carriers from like a woven wrap or a ring sling?

babywearing,3dfivp,KKilljoy,10,Wed Jul 15 23:25:57 2015 UTC,I've been a big fan of the Infantino Mei Tai carrier after trying several ring slings with my LO. It's tummy to tummy carry which I found easier to do housework/shop in than a ring sling anyway.   Amazon has one pattern for only $26

I bought a cheap pouch sling and had the same issues. She fit into the sling awkwardly, sort of contorted. And she doesn't like the fabric over her face. This the only way she will sleep and I can't walk around with her head poking out like that. She used to be ok with upright carries but is boycotting them now. Help?!"
babywearing,3dfivp,raspberry_lonestarr,6,Wed Jul 15 21:40:02 2015 UTC,"Its hard to see from the angle of the camera, but you should be carrying her upright at all times. Ditch the pouch sling as they are complete crap and potentially lethal.  The moby is only good up to about 15 pounds. I would join a babywearing international group with a lending library and try different carriers. You may like a woven wrap, or a ring sling.  If you want to tandem wear the twins, you could use a long woven, two ring slings, or a specific twin carrier like the twingo."
babywearing,3dfivp,fading_fad,3,Wed Jul 15 23:20:21 2015 UTC,"At this age, tandem wearing is especially not recommended; you cannot carry a baby this young in a back carry, and since it's hard to monitor both babies closely for compromised airway, I would advise the OP to stick to wearing just one baby  properly.   OP, do you have a local Babywearing International chapter or babywearing group that could help you out? Many have educators and lending libraries that allow you to borrow carriers and can help you with fit and positioning."

babywearing,3dfivp,maybebabyg,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:52:32 2015 UTC,I second the Infantino mei tai or another great option that will work well for you is a soft structured carrier like a Lillebaby or Ergo.
babywearing,3de14q,_pennylane,6,Wed Jul 15 15:17:27 2015 UTC,Without a picture it will be hard to help. My best guess is that she is still too small for the carrier and it is overextending her hips. You can try the infant insert (with just the bottom cushion part) or try a ring sling or wrap. Soft structured carriers like the ergo 360 are best for babies that are closer to sitting up on their own and when the fabric does not extend past the backs of the knees. Hope that helps!

babywearing,3db3uf,Furrypotatoes,4,Tue Jul 14 22:12:18 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the print, or if it's a wrap conversion (WC). Some prints are exclusive to a specific retailer (like Ollie, First Flight, or Charming), and only a few are made, so they resell for much more than retail. WCs retail for more, and can resell for $400-1200, depending on the wrap used, and if it's a full conversion or only partial (ie. backed with canvas).  The prints you see available online are not exclusive or hard to find. All tulas hold their value very well right now, so even if used, you're probably looking at paying at least retail."

babywearing,3db3uf,bekkit,2,Tue Jul 14 23:56:47 2015 UTC,"Some people just get real wound up about getting a specific pattern, I guess. Like to match a theme nursery or whatever.  One girl in my local baby wear group got two (TWO!) kinderpacks in trade for a wc Tula."
babywearing,3d996n,arabis,8,Tue Jul 14 14:25:56 2015 UTC,"Your baby will still be on the small side for using a Tula. Ring slings are great for newborns all the way through toddlerhood, and they're really easy to get on and off quickly once you get the hang of it. Plus they're nice and compact, so they're great fit travel. Tulas and other SSCs are great for when babies are a little bit bigger, but I think a ring sling will be more of what you need for traveling.   Edit: the tail of a ring sling also makes a convenient nursing cover, if you like to use one."
babywearing,3d996n,TheKittenButcher,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:52:34 2015 UTC,"Those are all wonderful points, thank-you for your response! I am definitely leaning towards the ring sling."
babywearing,3d996n,momonomicon,3,Tue Jul 14 14:54:51 2015 UTC,"I have a ring sling and a woven. I love both, but I've really been favoring my ring sling with my 1 year old.  I'd your biggest concern is easy on and off and breeastfeeding, 1000% go with a ring sling. I went to ikea with my daughter when she was 3 months old, and I walked around breastfeeding her. They're really great for breastfeeding, just remember to practice first. It's also much smaller to pack. The only problem with ring slings and airports is that the rings will set off metal detectors. I hear that sometimes tsa agents will let you wear your baby through security, but that will be less likely to work if you set the alarm off.   Now, it is not without flaws. A tula or any ssc will be more comfortable for long periods of time, and they're less prone to errors. If you forget to position the rings correctly or make sure the sling isn't twisted, which I still occasionally do, you either have to re do the carry or deal with it. It doesn't take very long, but if you've got a fussy baby, it isn't fun.   I actually think having both is useful. I preferred my woven up until my daughter got too heavy for a front carry.  I'm not a ssc expert, but I thought tula carriers were sized? I didn't think you needed an infant insert. And even if you do, I'm not sure you'd still need one by 3 months. But hopefully someone else who has experience with SSCs will comment."
babywearing,3d996n,pinkpowerranger8,3,Tue Jul 14 15:09:48 2015 UTC,"When I first got into baby wearing,  I found my local lending library when baby was 1 month old and was insistent on wanting to rent the tula.  They kept telling me no, I should wait but I was insistent.  I couldn't get her to fit right and they had convinced me to get a ring sling too.  I LOVED it for my Itty bitty baby.  It was so convenient and easy to use.  When I traveled I used the ringsling and odd have to take it off through security but a sweet stranger offered to hold my baby while I got it situated and back on. But eventually,  around 4 months, we found the tula love.  Bought one and haven't looked back.  We still occasionally try the ring sling but honestly I just prefer the tula now."
babywearing,3d996n,pinkpowerranger8,2,Tue Jul 14 16:20:16 2015 UTC,"Also,  re:breastfeeding...  A million times easier in the ringsling.  Plus the extra tail will give you a cover also.  The tula has always been difficult for me.  I Figured it out, but we only ever did it out of extreme necessity."
babywearing,3da3r5,keeksg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:03:38 2015 UTC,"My daughter went through a period where she didn't like being worn around 4 months, but that seemed to be about having to face me and not being able to look around. She equally disliked the ring sling and the woven.   Maybe try only using pre tied carries like the fcc? It sounds like he may just not be a fan of the wrapping process."

babywearing,3d5vvw,klhartford1203,14,Mon Jul 13 19:41:31 2015 UTC,Honestly?  I don't see the need to bring a wrap to the hospital. You'll have nurses to help you and it might be more of a hassle then it's worth at that point.   Good luck with everything!  I'm jealous-meeting your baby for the first time is nothing short of magic :)
babywearing,3d5vvw,sweetpea07,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:45:45 2015 UTC,Wraps aren't just because you need to get things done. It can be used for skin to skin and allow mama hands to eat or talk on the phone during. At many hospitals nurses are not there to take care of your baby they are just concerned with their medical care and leave everything else to you.
babywearing,3d5vvw,racerocks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:07:32 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's very true. But I know when I was still in the hospital I had visitors wanting to hold our little one, and the nurses checking on me and baby. It just seems like it may be a lot of work to be taking baby in and out. Plus I did a lot of sitting and don't find baby wearing the most comfortable while sitting."
babywearing,3d5vvw,sweetpea07,7,Mon Jul 20 01:15:07 2015 UTC,"I second not needing a wrap at the hospital. On top of having nurses to help, remember that you will likely be very sore. I didn't really feel up to any babywearing for at least a week after just because I was recovering."
babywearing,3d5vvw,batswantsababy,4,Mon Jul 13 20:21:06 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't bring one with either.  Especially if you are new to babywearing, trying with your hours old baby doesn't seem like a good idea."

babywearing,3d5vvw,dirtbooksun,-1,Mon Jul 13 21:41:09 2015 UTC,Moby. It is the easiest to master the first time. You don't want to look to unsure at the hospital or the staff there might swoop in and start bossing you around and telling you not to use it if they are unfamiliar with baby wearing. And practice before hand with a doll or teddy. You'll be home soon enough to use the other ones. Plus there isn't always much storage space at hospital for personal belongings and 3 carriers would be overkill.
babywearing,3d42g9,dirtbooksun,2,Mon Jul 13 10:31:44 2015 UTC,"I've made two now, a sling and a wrap. My wrap stretches in one direction and is nice and breezy. My sling is actually made from a scarf I found on clearance at old Navy for four dollars. I tie the ends and it is a perfect length for us.  There are women all over the world that make due with what they have and don't spend hundreds in wraps. I got the pleasure of visiting with several African women last summer. I was wearing my daughter in the wrap I had made and they were using wraps they had made. It was very simple and beautiful. Then I found no reason not to do as they had!"
babywearing,3d42g9,bamstout,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:59:43 2015 UTC,That sounds great. What a wonderful experience that must have been with the African women. I would love to learn to torso carry like they do one day.

I originally set out to get some osnaburg, but I found it to be a touch too heavy. There were a dozen or so different weights of similar material all next to each other ranging from a muslin to osnaburg and I got one very close to the osnaburg. I prefer it to my purchased woven wrap as it's far more flexible (no matter how much I try to break in the purchased wrap).  Babywearing can seem inaccessible to those with financial constraints and I want to always be prepared to show people that it's possible on a very tight budget."

babywearing,3d1wyl,kristaforwalkin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:24:13 2015 UTC,"Here are my top 3 in an album.   My favorite all-purpose wrap is Girasol Firework. Girasol is a handwoven brand from Guatemala that is generally a little lower in price than Didymos. Firework is a beautiful range of yellows, oranges and reds in 100% cotton. It comes in a variety of weft colors, and I feel like in Girasols especially, the choice of weft has a huge influence on the look of the wrap. For example, their Amitola comes in a crazy number of different weft choices (here are five side by side). My firework has a yellow weft (sold as ""bonbon de limon"") and was purchased new from Purple Elm Baby for about $155 (size 6) if memory serves. It breaks in very quickly, holds a knot well, medium weight, soft enough for comfort but strong enough to hold my 25-lb toddler without much sag. My second favorite is Oscha Strato Rosaline. Oscha is machine-woven in Scotland at about the same price point as Didy. Strato is a cloud pattern very much like Alto but more dense. Alto/Strato are fairly popular wraps in my area but honestly the pattern is not my favorite; what I really love is the deep purple of the Rosaline colorway, which actually de-emphasizes the pattern a bit. It's a sturdy wool/mohair blend that I have in a size 4 for super-quick ruck tied under bum (I can also just manage tied in front, because of the nice taper on the tails). It's a more slippery fabric than cotton but it's a great combination of light and sturdy that insulates in both hot and cold weather. But mostly, I just love that purple. Unfortunately I don't have a better picture that actually shows the wrap. We got this one on the big FB swap for about $135 which was a pretty good price at the time but like many on the swap it goes up or down with the trends. We bought it when everyone was flipping their shit over Artipoppe (meh) and Oscha wasn't as hot. Third favorite, or honorable mention, is one I've only had on loan from our local group: Didymos Flamenco Hemp Indio. I have never been really into pink but this wrap made me a believer. Really bold, eye-catching wrap that is thick and amazingly supportive. Softer than Rosaline but more textured than Firework, this was the first ""beastly"" wrap I ever tried in terms of taking the weight with almost no sag (the top honor there goes to Solnce Angel Wings, another loaner, not really my style but you could probably carry a cement truck in it without breaking a sweat). Note, there are TWO VERSIONS OF THIS WRAP; pictured in my album is the V1, it's thicker and generally more sought-after. I figure if you're gonna go big plush hemp, go all the way. Hemp is known for being on the warm side which is partly why I never looked to buy one myself (I live in a hot area)."
babywearing,3d1wyl,bakemaster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:30:59 2015 UTC,Anything Pavo! They aren't all expensive especially if you stay away from the newer releases. also the diamond weave Inda Janis are amazing. It's handwoven but very budget and has amazing cush.

babywearing,3d1wyl,Icy_candy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:03:45 2015 UTC,Pavos vary incredibly which is part of their appeal. hearts is famous for being a thick toddler worthy wrap. Where as Giras are famous for being great thin baby wraps but less ideal with toddlers. There are some thinner Pavos like zebra. Their thickness in gsm is always advertised on their website so u know just like didys. I love thick wraps as I have a very heavy toddler and picky shoulders so like the cush but it is so individual
babywearing,3cuj5h,Peanutparty29,14,Fri Jul 10 21:59:51 2015 UTC,"From what I've read it can aggravate already existing hip issues but doesn't cause them from out of nowhere. That said, the main issue with crotch danglers like Baby Bjorns is that they're not ergonomic and are uncomfortable for the baby after a few minutes in there.   Definitely would recommend trying out multiple carriers before settling on one because you don't know for sure if you'll like it or not. There are many kinds and people get on differently depending on personal preference. Or at least try out the Ergo 360 and make sure you and LO like it first.  E: Oh, and btw OP, some people use a scarf to widen out the base of narrow based carriers. Google baby carrier scarf trick and there's pictorials floating around."
babywearing,3cuj5h,ching_chong_peruna,6,Fri Jul 10 22:24:53 2015 UTC,"Just a tip on trying different carriers : search for a babywearing international group in your area. They hold meetings and usually have a library of carriers you can try, and if you become a member you can borrow a carrier to test out at home. The dues are small,  just 30 per year in my large Midwest city."
babywearing,3cuj5h,iamcakebeth,7,Sat Jul 11 00:17:18 2015 UTC,"There isn't enough seat on a Bjorn for baby to be ""froggy style"" that's how they got the nick name ""crotch dangler"". While it is not an ideal position and may not be comfortable for you for long it will not cause hip displaysia. It can and will exaserbate any hip issues babies have though.  I know plenty of people who use them, but if it were me I would avoid using a narrow based carrier unless I didn't have any other choices."
babywearing,3cuj5h,MamaBayer,3,Fri Jul 10 22:28:46 2015 UTC,"I will add, there are many other less costly and more ergonomic options if price is a concern for you. Infantino Union and Mai Tei being a couple of them."

That being said, imo, they aren't terrible for short periods of time if it's all you have. It's one of the only carriers that baby can easily be carried facing out, and my girl LOVES being in it. I have had her in it for 3 hours before, no problem (not ideal though either) I recently bought a beco butterfly carrier from Craigslist for super cheap though. I need to do more googling, but I think baby can still face out in it, but I might be thinking of the Gemini. Either way, I prefer carrying over the stroller which is why I got something more ergonomic for baby, since I will be using it for longer periods of time.."

I wouldn't but it unless she has. There is most likely a local Babywearing International (BWI) group in yor city where you can try on a variety of different carriers and even check them out for a month to borrow and make sure you like. When my husband and I got rid of our Ergo we went and tried on at least 5 different ones. Guess what? I HATED the Kinderpack!

I love the motto practice not product. It's about Babywearing not who has the most fanciest carrier.   If you like kinderpack then I would recommend Manduca or Tula. Lenny lamb is more thinner like Wompat or the new Fidella fusion that's coming out. A lot of people who love tula also love kokadi flip.   If you like the cool knit from the kinderpack I would recommend an Lillebaby airflow or all seasons. I have my own library and I do own a kinderpack in it, however it doesn't justify the selling price in many cases..   Happy Babywearing.  Edit: on Facebook kinderpack does a right to buy draw, you can always enter and see if you can get drawn but your chances will be slim."

LL are becoming more popular as people are trying to get them instead of KPs and Tulas but if you're willing to buy an older, less flashy one second hand or from the site they're not too bad. Lillebaby I've heard good things about and aren't as flashy looks wise. Wraps have a very active BST with a wide variety of options.

babywearing,3cp8d0,akpak,2,Thu Jul 9 20:46:56 2015 UTC,"So, I scored a Kinderpack once, for a friend. My only advice is to set up an account and be logged in so your address doesn't have to be typed in, and either have your cc number on auto fill or copied to be quickly pasted. Memorize ccv and exp date. When you get the 'inventory issues' page, it is not necessarily sold out, so keep refreshing that page and sometimes you'll get one in your cart and get the cc info page. HOWEVER, the only time I've scored I never got inventory issues, I got it right away. I have tried maybe 20 times and scored once. There is an active group on Facebook called 'Kinderpack chatter and b/s/t' where they are very easy to come by, but I am not sure if they are accepting new members right now. They tend to sell for $275-350 depending on popularity of print. Check out other Facebook groups like The Babywearing Swap, they turn up there sometimes. HAVING SAID ALL THAT.... I bought myself a kp at market value and it's fine. It's not the best carrier, it's not the worst. I think for smaller babies you are just as well off with a Tula or Boba or something, but I understand kps are good for larger kids (the toddler and preschool sizes accommodate very large kids indeed)."

It will be over retail, but hopefully you can find a good deal. I hate seeing a lot of people in there sat they aren't buying and reselling but you can tell who is and isn't just flipping them bc they constantly have the new ones and are seeking them asking with 5 other weeks worth of newer ones for 500 each. To each their own, it sucks, but they find people spending the $$ on it. I had a really hard time even spending retail on it but it was worth it.  There aren't many made at a time and you have to be lucky when trying to score one. I somehow got lucky last year and use it daily with my heavy chunk. I see a lot of people now talk about getting a big group together to try from all their phones etc..... They had discovered boys being used a few months back and quickly took care of it so hopefully there aren't more. But even when I got one before they really went insane with popularity it was still a miracle to get them."

babywearing,3cp8d0,jay8s,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:09:07 2015 UTC,"Kinderpacks are fantastic. I'm renting one right now from my chapter of Babywearing International and I'm in love.   Scoring is hard. The best way to accomplish it is to find friends to try to help you and to not be dead set on a certain type of print. Get anything and then you can trade it for something you love later.   They do sell out in a minute - it isn't a scam. This is actually really common for popular ""crunchy"" items like baby carriers and cloth diapers. For instance, Bum Genius cloth diapers will release a new print of a diaper and offer 4-5 styles of how that diaper is made and have hundreds of them... they usually sell out in less than 5 minutes.   Anyway, see if you have a chapter of BWI near you. They have a lending library. Your wife can try on and check out many carriers. She might find something she loves MORE than a KP. I thought I would LOVE a Tula... I checked one out and ended up really disliking it. I like the KP simply because it has so many sizing options that I can actually use it and it isn't overwhelmingly large on my tiny frame (5' <100lbs) and yet my husband can use it as well... and he is 6' 280 lbs. Its hard to find a carrier that works so well for both of us... that is honestly the only reason I love KPs so much."
babywearing,3cp8d0,akpak,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:49:30 2015 UTC,My wife and I both have one. They are worth the wait as far as comfort goes. St Louis has a BWI chapter that has a few to play with. Let me know if you would like to try one.

babywearing,3cpm3p,Jennchilada,3,Thu Jul 9 20:18:13 2015 UTC,"SSCs are good for quick ups and downs and mei ties have more versatility. I like my wrap conversion mei tie because I can spread the straps over baby's butt for more support, and there are also multiple options for tying off. However, I use my buckle carrier more often for bigger kids because they want up and down frequently and its not worth going through the effort to wrap a mt just to unwrap 5 minutes later."
babywearing,3cpm3p,kristaforwalkin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:54:31 2015 UTC,That makes sense about frequent ups and downs. My guy is getting to that age. He loves running around and exploring. Do maybe I'll skip the sling and mei tai and just try a wrap. Thanks!

babywearing,3cgyz2,scubahana,8,Tue Jul 7 20:53:35 2015 UTC,"If you're going to buy only one, I would go for a woven wrap. Is your heart set on babymoov?  There are lots of great reputable brands that won't break the bank. Some of my favorite wraps for beginners are Dolcino, Girasol, C&C, or Storchenwiege (preferably used and broken in).    Woven wraps can have a steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, you'll have a beautiful carrier that's always the right size for baby and comfy for you!  :)  Look up Wrapping Rachel on YouTube for some great video tutorials."
babywearing,3cgyz2,LeahTT,2,Wed Jul 8 00:00:59 2015 UTC,I'm not totally set on babymoov; originally I was more interested in the Maya Wrap but I was finding it difficult to find a retailer who would ship to Denmark (boo). I'm definitely open to more suggestions!  I will have a look at the other brands you mentioned (opening tabs while I type) and the Wrapping Rachel tutorials were mentioned by another poster so that's two votes to go watch them!
babywearing,3cgyz2,dirtbooksun,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:28:02 2015 UTC,Look into the 2nd hand market. There are Facebook babywearing buy swap sell groups for lots of different countries/regions. No doubt there is a general Europe one. There are great deals on them lors of variety you won't be able to find new and you can also find wraps that will be already broken in which is good when u have a newborn
babywearing,3cgyz2,pwrpufgirlz,4,Tue Jul 14 11:37:40 2015 UTC,"I used to recommend a stretchy wrap for the newborn phase but now I say if you want a device that will get go from newborn to baby and even toddler and you can afford it, skip the stretchy wrap altogether and just get a regular woven wrap. It will last so much longer, be so much more comfortable, and won't stretch out with each use.   A ring sling is nice, but I'd go with a simpler linen or cotton one that isn't embellished, it will be easier to adjust. I also can't use ring slings very far into babyhood as I can only do symmetrical holds once my baby gets bigger.   Tl; dr: if I were starting with a newborn, I'd buy an inexpensive woven wrap and borrow a simple ring sling."
babywearing,3cgyz2,Flewtea,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:49:14 2015 UTC,"I'm looking for something I can use throughout babyhood and have been seeing a general consensus on the 'no stretchy' side of things.  Thanks for your input as well, the preference for a woven one over the ring slings is also becoming apparent."
babywearing,3cgyz2,snickiefritz,2,Wed Jul 8 09:39:28 2015 UTC,"There's definitely nothing more adaptable than a woven (I like my Little Frogs but I don't really have much experience with others) but in my day-to-day past the newborn phase, I wear my Lillebaby far more. It does take a little adjusting the buckles from me to my husband but that only takes about 30 seconds. I am trying to get the hang of high back carries with my wovens because that is one thing the SSCs aren't good for. I really like the quick off and on of the carrier since it's better for the playground and things like that. So, not sure if you're looking for preferences beyond the two you listed but I hope you love whatever you choose!"
babywearing,3cgyz2,fading_fad,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:00:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for mentioning other brands that you find appealing; I have had a general idea of what I wanted and originally was going to make my own but after reading a rather cautious few paragraphs from a woman who makes them for a living I decided that my sewing skills are awesome for things up to (but not yet including) things to securely carry my baby in.  I will have a look at the two brands you mentioned as well - there's a chance you have sent me the idea of my new baby sling :)
babywearing,3cgyz2,snickiefritz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:21:36 2015 UTC,"I would recommend both, if you can afford it. But for the beginning I'd suggest the wrap. A ring sling can be tricky to figure out. But they're amazing for quick ups and downs once you get the hang of it. I found it was easier after I'd already mastered the basics of wrapping first.   The link you posted for the wrap terrifies me though. Both of the carries pictured look incredibly unsafe. Back carries are not recommended with stretchy wraps. See how low the baby is on her back? It would be near impossible to check on baby to make sure they're doing okay back there. Ideally you want them to be able to see over your shoulder. And I do believe that forward facing carries are not ideal either.  The wrap itself is very safe, I'm sure though.  I would highly suggest looking up videos by wrapping Rachel or babywearing faith for proper instructions.  Now, if you're wanting something long term, I'd stay away from stretchy and go for a woven. If you look up babywearing on a budget groups on Facebook, you can find wraps for 100 dollars or less. Depending on your size, and your husbands size, I'd suggest a size 6 or maybe 7 to start.   Sorry for the brick of text, I'm mobile and formatting sucks."
babywearing,3cgyz2,babytoes,2,Wed Jul 8 03:16:49 2015 UTC,"I agree, that wrap that was linked looks horrible,  unsafe,  and uncomfortable."
babywearing,3cgyz2,Citruslatifolia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:15:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the quick recommendation, and if I could afford both I would :)  As I am a newbie at this I've been reading the TICKS guidelines and also each of those pages have the individual user manual linked at the bottom. They include the information such as being able to see and reach your baby's face and the like; I'm hoping those positions were simply because they were taking photos and not for actual daily use in that position. To respond to your stretchy/non-stretchy recommendation, the reviews of both of these slings say they have very little stretch to them so it is hopefully not a factor.  I will also look up the videos you mentioned for some more exposure to examples.  I've been also looking for slings on FB and secondhand groups in my area (I'm in Denmark so it's more limited) and there are unfortunately none to be found at the moment."
babywearing,3cgyz2,snickiefritz,2,Wed Jul 8 09:26:05 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to hear that you've been doing your research! I'm sure you'll be fine!   I just assumed that they were stretchy, because the carries they showed looked very saggy. It would be hard to get saggy carries like that in a woven.   If you're in Denmark, try Little Frog and Lenny Lamb, but go for the seconds quality wraps. Seconds just means they have a couple cosmetic flaws that do not affect the safety of the carrier. A lot of the time people can't even find the flaws once they get them. I'm pretty sure they'll ship to Denmark. The seconds wraps are usually less than $100CAD.   little frog   Lenny lamb"

babywearing,3cgyz2,spaceheater,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:58:27 2015 UTC,"I like having more than one option, depending on the occasion. I have a Manduca (soft structured carrier, buckles), a ring sling (an Oscha woven wrap conversion) and a woven wrap (Ellevill). Every once in a while, Ellevill has a half price sale, they are great starter wraps (I was told) and, if I'm not mistaken, located in Norway.  I find stretchy wraps are easier to learn how to tie, and you can pre- wrap and then put the baby in. I had a Moby that I used for ~ the first 4 months. I like them for the floppy baby stage.  I prefer gathered shoulder ring slings; they just feel more comfortable and spread the weight better, but it might be a question of body type. I use it mostly around the house or as a backup when we go out with a pram or somewhere where he'd be up and down a lot. It's not as good long term, although I have used it for a whole day while travelling and it was fine.  You've gotten great recommendations here, I really just wanted to add Ellevill to your list.   Also, see if there are baby wearing meetings near you, especially after the baby is born. You can usually try a variety of types and get help with tying, etc."
babywearing,3c962c,Likeabowloforanges,5,Mon Jul 6 01:44:44 2015 UTC,"Sakura slings are nice but I'd choose a wrap conversion ring sling every time, especially considering the high cost of Sakura slings."

babywearing,3c962c,MrsWhovian,3,Wed Jul 15 17:55:44 2015 UTC,"I haven't personally used either, but I do know that Tula ring slings are wrap conversion ring slings and Sakura Bloom slings are of high quality, but overpriced.   That being said, there's nothing special about one linen ring sling over another, and honestly unless you have a some time to break in a linen sling before use, I think you're going to be disappointed. They're stiff, not soft enough for newborn skin (in my opinion), and kind of hard to work with.   Wrap conversion slings are more expensive than a Sakura Bloom, but honestly not much. They're going to be a lot softer and more supple. I think they're much easier to work with.  If you're in Australia, I know temperature is a big concern, while a combed cotton or blend Tula sling would be just fine, i prefer lighter weaves like diamond weave.   Girasol is my preferred brand overall, but their diamond weave slings are especially airy, light, and supportive enough to last a very long time. I wear my 28lb toddler in mine for hours a day in very hot weather."

I wouldn't use them as an every day carrier, but I think it's fine for your use.   If you think this is the only time you'll use a water sling, then I think you can get the cheap one. If it's something you'd like to count on, then it might be worth investing in something more durable.  Although I've seen water slings with aluminum for as low as 30. If you have enough time for shipping, I recommend checking etsy or something along those lines.   Edit: I just looked at the link. If I remember correctly, the reason the nylon rings are considered less safe is because they have a seam. The rings in your link don't look seamed. It could also just be hiding the seam, though"

I can never manage to get them tightened evenly or comfortably so it doesn't cause me shoulder strain. Don't give up on back carries!

babywearing,3bxtat,snowellechan77,2,Fri Jul 3 01:17:10 2015 UTC,"The boba air might work for you. I really like how it packs up into a pocket. I found it comfortable, but some very petite people in my local group can't get it adjusted well to be comfortable. I wore it for about 30 minutes before I noticed the diggyness of the nonpadded straps."
babywearing,3bxtat,rizzlerazz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:55:42 2015 UTC,I wonder if you could pad the straps out yourself. I hadn't heard of the Boba Air and am pretty interested in it as a backup to take out with us when we take the pram. Hmm
babywearing,3bxtat,Jigglypops,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:10:45 2015 UTC,Thanks. It looks like I need to test the digging before I invest.
babywearing,3bxtat,whambat,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:23:51 2015 UTC,"I have a Boba Air. It's really easy to fold up into the pouch, and I leave it in the back of the car. When I take baby for stroller walks I throw it in the bottom just in case he gets super cranky. It is a good backup, but it is NOT as comfortable as a normal SSC and isn't great for long periods. The unpadded shoulder straps do dig in."
babywearing,3bxtat,Citruslatifolia,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:33:23 2015 UTC,"Good info! Thanks!   That's how I use my ring sling: it's great as a pram backup and to have in his nappy bag, but it's not supportive enough for a full day of carrying him around."

babywearing,3bv46c,Jigglypops,4,Thu Jul 2 12:02:11 2015 UTC,At that age you can probably ditch the large part of the insert and just use the part baby sits on to elevate them and help their knew bend freely.
babywearing,3bv46c,racerocks,4,Thu Jul 2 12:17:37 2015 UTC,"You can try to use it with just the pillow part as explained below, but it might not be a safe fit.  The infant insert is for babies without good head or trunk control.  Without the insert baby could slump down and restrict their airway.  I'd be cautious.  Can you post a pic so we can see what it looks like without?  In general though, remember that babywearing is going to be hot in the summer.  Keep both of you in a single layer of clothing so you don't have skin on skin and it might help.  Also, you can dab yourself and baby with a wet wash cloth to help cool down."
babywearing,3bv46c,mmmmmpopplers,3,Thu Jul 2 15:14:30 2015 UTC,"Since she has reached the weight for not using the insert, I think what you have to pay attention to is if she fits well without it and, especially, if her head is well supported. At 4 months, babies can usually hold up their heads well, so there may be less available support from the carrier. I don't have an ergo, though, so I don't know about your specific case."
babywearing,3bv46c,Citruslatifolia,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:52:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you (and other comments!) for the replies.  I tried baby without the insert and it was definitely not a good fit. Her legs didn't seem to froggy wide enough and although she is pretty long, didn't seem to sit high enough. We used the insert with her legs froggied out of it (since this is how they naturally sat at this stage) and she was comfy. It WAS hot though.   I will try tomorrow with just the pillow part of the insert.  Do you think there is any reason it would be unsafe to carry on using the insert over 12lb? She was snug but obviously her airways were clear etc. Without the insert the carrier just seemed very big for her."
babywearing,3bv46c,Citruslatifolia,2,Thu Jul 2 16:51:19 2015 UTC,The only reason I can think of for the insert to be unsafe for a larger baby is of it somehow covers their mouth or nose or makes them uncomfortable because it's too tight... But it doesn't seem to be the case.
babywearing,3bv46c,KKilljoy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:48:29 2015 UTC,I also had a big (for her age) baby and used the insert past 12lb for sure. She was born almost 10lb so at 12 lb she still didn't have good head control so we relied on the insert to help provide the support she needed.
babywearing,3bv46c,TheCarzilla,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:43:44 2015 UTC,"I recommend using just the pillow for a while!  My son is going on 9 weeks and just under 14lbs. I use the Ergo all the time and also used it for my first baby. We ditched the insert a couple weeks ago (so not very far off from where you are) but still use the pillow. For a while I kept his legs tucked against my belly, and just today managed to put them froggy. Without the pillow his head would be too low, but with the insert he would be too squished. He doesn't have total head control, but he just rests his head on my chest and sleeps anyway."

This isn't necessarily a problem in most cases,  proof of that is i occasionally wear my four year old in it with no problem.

babywearing,3bqf4r,lrrhorn,5,Wed Jul 1 08:49:39 2015 UTC,I wear my 21lb 6 monther in a Didy with no issues. I tried him in a ring sling and it was uncomfortable after 10 minutes. Which Didy do you have? It's possible you'd be better off with one that's a little cushier (my Indio Orient is definitely diggier than my Storch Leo).  You can always try a hip carry to see if you like the feel of it with your current woven - look up robin's hip carry or Poppins hip carry.
babywearing,3bqf4r,keeksg,3,Wed Jul 1 12:11:14 2015 UTC,"You can use them for toddlers and beyond safely, its more of a matter of comfort because the weight is on one shoulder. You should be fine though for short carries though."
babywearing,3bqf4r,fading_fad,3,Wed Jul 1 09:15:15 2015 UTC,Why do you feel she's too heavy for a woven wrap? A ring sling is also woven but only worn on one shoulder so it would feel even less supportive. Maybe it's just time to learn different carries suited to your baby's size and age with the Didy?
babywearing,3bqf4r,racerocks,2,Wed Jul 1 10:26:19 2015 UTC,I've been having the same issues and haven't been able to make it to a meet up. My baby is 18 lbs at 6 months and the two carries I know. Snuggle hold and double cross carry are not working as well as they used to. What would you recommend?
babywearing,3bqf4r,andilynscott,6,Wed Jul 1 12:54:35 2015 UTC,Can they sit unassisted? Back carries changed my life! Wrap you in love (?) has a lot of great video tutorials of different carries.

babywearing,3bqf4r,andilynscott,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:09:41 2015 UTC,You don't need the baby to be able to sit at all to do back carries with a woven or mei tai. If you have mastered at least two front carries and feel confident you can back carry.
babywearing,3bqf4r,racerocks,3,Wed Jul 1 16:19:57 2015 UTC,"Front wrap cross carry, kangaroo, and poppins are my go to's. :)"
babywearing,3bqf4r,racerocks,3,Wed Jul 1 16:20:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with others that a ring sling is not going to be more supportive than your woven.   What carry or carries do you use? There are hip carries and you can buy sling rings for use with a woven so you can try it out.   I have both a woven and a ring sling though, and I'm glad I do. My ring sling comes everywhere with me. Its great for when I'm out and my daughter gets cranky and just needs to be carried. I use my woven for longer outings (hiking, fairs) and almost exclusively for back carries at this point because she's too heavy to wear on my front without my back breaking (baby is 23 lbs). I do like it for hip carries as well, but back carries are just infinitely more comfortable.   And I don't know if I would necessarily say ring slings are simpler. They're definitely easier to learn, but I still make mistakes sometimes. Little stuff like using the bottom rail as the top rail, making it hard to tighten and much less comfortable, or not ending up with the rings in a good position, which is also less comfortable. Wovens are definitely harder to learn, but I very rarely make a mistake after the 2nd or 3rd time using a specific carry."
babywearing,3bqf4r,momonomicon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:42:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Can I use a hip carry with a four month old, or do they need to be able to sit up on their own?"
babywearing,3bqf4r,momonomicon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:31:20 2015 UTC,"It depends. I think they just need to be holding their heads up, but I couldn't hip carry my daughter until she was 8 or 9 months. It worked when I tried (4 months, I think?) But it just didn't really feel right to me. So maybe they do need to be sitting up. Try it and see how it feels."
babywearing,3bqf4r,shadeofmyheart,2,Wed Jul 1 19:07:48 2015 UTC,"Wovens can usually go longer (for heavier babies) than slings because of how you can distribute the weight evenly. I wore my babe in a ring sling until she was 22 lbs. after 20 lbs I couldn't do it for long enough times, honestly.   I ended up getting a toddler Tula at that point."
babywearing,3bqf4r,meeksthecat,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:56:51 2015 UTC,I had my didymos Indio stars converted into a ring sling. My 32 pound 18 month old loves it and requests to go up regularly.  Is there a babywearing group close to you? Perhaps you can try one before you chop your wrap.
babywearing,3bqf4r,meeksthecat,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:17:54 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm not going to chop the didymos! Would definitely find some other fabric if I decide to go that route. Honestly, though I think I just need to change up the wrap I use. Had been doing front wrap cross carry almost exclusively, but will try some of these other suggestions!"
babywearing,3bqf4r,TheKittenButcher,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:29:46 2015 UTC,"Have you considered just a front cross carry? It makes a giant X in the front, and baby sits in the middle of the X. Much more supportive, especially if you sandwich the shoulders."

babywearing,3bn4bb,Citruslatifolia,3,Tue Jun 30 17:23:41 2015 UTC,"I used the Moby with my little one and loved it, but it can get very warm because of all the layers of fabric. A ring sling would be cooler, depending on the fabric you choose. I would recommend looking into sling meets in your area so you can try things out before spending any money. If that's not possible, you'll find good tips on the affordable slings pages on Facebook, which others have recommended. I bought my ring sling off of one of these pages. (I have no experience with the K'tan.)"

But I keep the trek in my car because it is quick to pop baby in and out running to the store and such. Maybe it's my small frame, but when I wear the trek in front one shoulder strap always falls down. My baby is only 8 months, so I'm hoping it will improve when he gets bigger."

Since you're so petite I'd suggest a size 5, which will allow most basic carries. It would still have a lot of tail for things like rebozo though,  so a 2 or 3 might be good for those.  I suggest watching lots of youtoube videos,  or finding a local group for hands on help."

babywearing,3b2pvr,mmmmmpopplers,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:41:48 2015 UTC,That sounds like just what I need!  Thank you so much!
babywearing,3b2pvr,eric_md,4,Thu Jun 25 15:46:24 2015 UTC,"Definitely find a local lending library if you have the option! However, if you don't want to fuss with a wrap your options are a bit more limited, but I share your sentiment. I love the Ergo 360. It is quite warm, especially in hot summer weather, but it is very easy to just strap it on and go. It also allows front-inward, front-outward, back, and hip carry. Don't entirely count out the wraps though, they do get easier with practice, and I've worn the Moby on occasion (well, only when I forgot to pack the Ergo, but still)."
babywearing,3b2pvr,eric_md,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:40:43 2015 UTC,Is your wrap easy to do by yourself?  Does it get warm?
babywearing,3b2pvr,beadmaze,2,Thu Jun 25 16:59:49 2015 UTC,"The Moby is fairly easy to do, but I have to put my daughter down to get it tied on. It is warm, but not nearly as warm as the Ergo. My wife loves the Solly wrap though. The Solly wrap functions the same as the Moby, and the fabric is much cooler, but I haven't personally worn that one. The Ergo is click and go, and can't be beat for speed."
babywearing,3b2pvr,beadmaze,3,Thu Jun 25 17:04:47 2015 UTC,"I love my beco gemini. It can carry a newborn, although I never did use it at that point so I can't comment on how it worked for that. But it has forward facing and back carry options. It's very comfortable,  easy to put on, washes well.   I was also able to hike and nurse at the same time using it so that was a big plus in my book."
babywearing,3b2pvr,warpweftweave,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:31:16 2015 UTC,This one looks like what I am looking for.  Some of the reviews are saying its a bit hard to get on or unlach with baby.  Did you have any trouble?
babywearing,3b2pvr,london61983,2,Thu Jun 25 18:39:15 2015 UTC,Absolutely not. I actually find it really easy. The buckles have safety features where you have to push the tab before unfastening them but I just hug my arms around my son in the carrier and it's fine. He's 13 months and 25 lbs and I still use the carrier every day.
babywearing,3b2pvr,tvw0911,3,Thu Jun 25 19:19:11 2015 UTC,"I love my lillebaby! It has an ergonomic forward facing, you can use it from 7 pounds without an insert and up to 40 pounds, and it has a lumbar support that makes it really comfy. Highly recommended!"

babywearing,3b4rh7,glitterbomb1,7,Thu Jun 25 23:30:21 2015 UTC,"I had the insert and couldn't make that thing work for the life of me. Try with a few rolled receiving blankets under baby's butt first. If that doesn't work, then maybe give the insert a try. Oh, but do note that the insert is not a good idea if you will be wearing baby in warm weather. It makes the baby pretty warm."
babywearing,3b4rh7,Ehynot,3,Fri Jun 26 01:37:40 2015 UTC,"Came here to suggest this. I never used the insert, just rolled up a blanket underneath his butt."
babywearing,3b4rh7,itsincrediblytypical,2,Fri Jun 26 11:00:45 2015 UTC,"The deciding factor is whether he can sit in the carrier with no insert and have his knees bent 90 degrees easily. If the carrier bunches up and puts pressure on the back of his knees, take the little pillow out if the insert and tuck that under his butt, then let him bend his knees 90 degrees and rest his feet in the seat of the carrier."

babywearing,3aw9pu,Sbzitz,2,Wed Jun 24 01:25:35 2015 UTC,"Are you sure it fits properly? If the carrier is too loose, it can cause that unsupported feeling. I second the idea about finding a local babywearing group to spot check you.   Also, how long do you leave her in the carrier before giving up? She might just cry because it's new, but after a few minutes she might get used to it."
babywearing,3aw9pu,saratina,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:49:21 2015 UTC,"This is the story of my LO exactly! We got the Baby K'tan, the Baby K'tan Breeze, the Ergo with and without the infant insert, a ring sling, and finally the Infantino Mei Tei.   My LO tolerated the Ergo once between 0-4mo for about 20 minutes. After that I carried the baby and my hubby carried the Ergo.   I was using correct positioning although I'm sure I was nervous as it had always gone badly once that arm was removed.   Then we got the Infantino Mei Tei around 5.5 months and she is fine w it! If she begins to get fussy I wrap my left arm below her butt on the outside of the carrier and it's thin enough (or something else magical) she can feel me and calms. The best part was it was the cheapest by far at $35.00.   I don't know if it was her age or the carrier but the carrier definitely played a role. At 6.5 months she tolerates the ergo a little, still hates the ring sling and both baby k'tans. Will stay in the Infantino a couple hours happily while I walk, bend, shop, vacuum.   Best of luck. It's great when something finally works - but man is it frustrating when it isn't."
babywearing,3aw9pu,KKilljoy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:41:04 2015 UTC,"Mine hated carriers. Of all types. But I kept at it, because I couldn't piss one-handed anymore. She would fuss for a few mis, and then sleep. Then she would wake up and want out. But I just kept having her nap in the wrap, and eventually she came to love it as a safe comforting place. Once she was comfortable, she would spend more and more time awake. Now, at 9 months, she is a pro.   Keep at it. It gets easier."
babywearing,3aw9pu,snickiefritz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:38:45 2015 UTC,"move. i've had to wrap while walking before. get her in the carrier, pat her bum pretty hard and walk briskly.  if that doesn't help she might just need a few mins in, then out, every day and she'll get used to it.

I have a ring sling and Lillebaby and my baby hated them until he was old enough to face out. The only time he'd be ok in them was if I put him in when he was already asleep. He just disliked not being able to see what was going on, I guess.  He still doesn't like the ring sling, but loves facing out in the Lillebaby."

babywearing,3atrbj,keeksg,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:33:48 2015 UTC,"At least in the US you don't have to remove them in security but as others mentioned they swab your hands, and you use the regular x-ray if they have the other scanners.  On the plane technically they need to be not in the carrier on take off and landing, but I've only had this enforced maybe 25% of the time. If we're using the ergo I just unclip and pull down the straps but leave her in the seat part unless she gets too wiggly."

babywearing,3atrbj,saratina,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:42:16 2015 UTC,In Australia at least they require you to unwrap the baby and put the carrier through the scanner. I use a ring sling for this as i find that very easy compared to my wraps but a sec would work too. I have wondered though what would happen if i put my baby in a popable carry in a wrap like a front cross carry maybe i could get away without taking the wrap off. i don't see how it is different to a shirt then and has no metal. Might try next trip...

babywearing,3anyai,TheKittenButcher,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:02:33 2015 UTC,"I should have included that my two year old is ~28 pounds. She weighed that much at a year old, lost two pounds when she started walking and has gained it back since."
babywearing,3anyai,Kappa_the_imp,2,Tue Jun 23 08:30:32 2015 UTC,"I've used a ring sling, a gauze wrap, a woven, and an infantino mei tai. I reach for the mei tai more than any other carrier."
babywearing,3anyai,steak_salad,2,Mon Jun 22 16:18:27 2015 UTC,"Do you have any tips? I've used ours since birth, but am starting to notice pain after. I loved using the hip carry until the burning pain in my hips so I'm back to the front carry but with some back pain. My baby is only 8 months (about 17 pounds)."
babywearing,3anyai,GoiterGlitter,3,Mon Jun 22 17:59:15 2015 UTC,I found that it wasn't comfortable anymore after my daughter hit about 20-25 pounds. The weight limit is higher than almost anyone can comfortably carry in that position with unpadded straps that you're tying.
babywearing,3anyai,steak_salad,2,Tue Jun 23 04:52:13 2015 UTC,Have you looked on YouTube for more supportive ways to tie it on? I haven't tried them yet but I have seen some suggestions before.

babywearing,3amvrj,zmegz,2,Sun Jun 21 20:02:15 2015 UTC,"If making one is an option, then you can make a ring sling for about $30 (estimated..).  I bought cotton twill on sale (2.5m - I'm tall lol), used some cute cotton print that I had at home, and bought a pack of rings from slingrings.com.  It took me a couple of hours to put it all together.  There are tons of patterns on Pinterest if you're interested, or PM me and I can give you the easy-mode instructions that I used."
babywearing,3amvrj,Aeliyah,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:33:32 2015 UTC,You can get new ones on etsy in the $20-40 range as well. Not sure how people make money selling them that cheap but they are there.
babywearing,3amvrj,girlonbike,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:59:18 2015 UTC,Personally we loved our Little Frog ring sling for that kind of thing. Just google Little Frog [insert country here] retailer and you will find lots of shops online where you can get them. They are a very reputable company and their ring slings are high quality.
babywearing,3amvrj,dalikin,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:50:58 2015 UTC,"If you're crafty at all, you can easily make your own wrap (it just needs to be hemmed) for $20-$30. You can either use something like osnaburg for a traditional woven wrap feel, or stretch jersey for something like the Moby wrap (they're about $50), which is great for newborns.   If you don't feel up to making one yourself, the Infantino Mei Tai is $27 and is awesome. I still use mine for my 25lb toddler. It'll take a bit of finagling to work with a newborn (either cinching the base with a ribbon for legs out, or using a rolled up blanket under LO's bum for legs in), but that's a great affordable option.   Check out the Babywearing on a Budget FB page for all things under $100, if you don't mind purchasing something that's been pre-loved. Local children's consignment shops are also great places to look, mine almost always has a couple of styles of Ergos in stock for about $40."
babywearing,3amvrj,TheKittenButcher,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:57:28 2015 UTC,Check kijiji/Craig's list for a used ring sling. That's my favourite carrier for nursing in.
babywearing,3amvrj,neluuna,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:41:24 2015 UTC,"For a 2 week old i 2nd the suggestion for a stretchy wrap. These are one of the few things that are worthwhile making your own. Just get 5m of stretchy cotton jersey. no need to even hem and you can split the width down the middle to make 2. you'll need to get something else though down the track when your baby gets a bit heavier (maybe 6kg or so it will start to be uncomfortable). I wouldn't waste money on a DIY woven, they generally cost close to a comercial 2nd hand wrap and are much more difficult to learn on and less comfy in my opinion. You can though make a decent DIY mei tai or ring sling. Cheap carriers you can buy include the Infano mei tai which is only around $30 on Amazon and i think possibly even cheaper i hear at Walmart. Then you can also look for 2nd hand carriers on the Babywearing Swap facebook page if you are in the US or there are other pages for other countries. If you don't want to learn wrapping then Ergos, mini monkey, tulas are all good brands but are a bit more pricy. Don't get these off ebay as they are all fakes that are not safe."

babywearing,3aiz6z,TheKittenButcher,3,Sat Jun 20 17:29:54 2015 UTC,"I've been babywearing for 17 months now, and I was dying for a new wrap in bright colors, without breaking the bank. I stumbled across some blog posts on DIY osnaburg wraps, and even though I had basically no sewing experience, I decided to give it a try. Believe me, if I can do it, ANYONE can do it. I used Dharma dyes in Mermaids Dream and Seafoam to do the fish scale-ish tye die on it. I'm actually really impressed with how soft and easy to use this wrap is. It's MUCH thinner than my previous wrap (a cotton Little Frog), which makes it nice for summer time. I'm so impressed with it that I just bought more fabric to make a galaxy dyed shorty! Thanks for looking, and if you have any questions I'll be happy to answer!"

babywearing,3aiz6z,lrrhorn,2,Sun Jun 21 00:23:07 2015 UTC,"It depends what size wrap you want to make. The average person's ""base size"" (that you can do all major carries with) will be a six, a five if you're petite, and a seven if you're plus size. To determine the length of fabric that is, I like paxbaby's size chart:http://paxbaby.com/paxbabys-woven-wrap-guide/"

babywearing,3a7ghk,Yogicj,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:17:50 2015 UTC,"Country Save powder is great and cheap.  This list is for cloth diapers that I've heard other people use for wraps as well.  This resource says liquid is recommended but you still want to look out for things that don't have optical brighteners.  I don't know that I'm convinced it will really make your wrap unsafe over the course of your wearing days, I don't really wash my wraps that often.  What it might do is reduce your resale value or make it hard to resell if you have prospective buyers asking about wash routine and they are hyper vigilant about OBs.  Good luck, that's a beautiful wrap!"
babywearing,3a7ghk,annielane,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:46:24 2015 UTC,"Wow. Thank you! Theses are great resources.  So its the optical brighteners that stay in the fabric after wash that natibaby's instructions are trying to avoid? I can't figure out what ingredient is meant to be avoided...  I can't imagine I'll resell, and assume I won't wash very often. It's just that first wash I'm concerned about. I'm new to all this so I don't want to screw it up before I even start.  Thanks for your help!"
babywearing,3a7ghk,TempleU,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:27:54 2015 UTC,"No powders are safe. You need to use something without optical brighteners.

babywearing,3a484a,woolymarmet,3,Wed Jun 17 02:38:53 2015 UTC,"I've been told (repeatedly, lol!) by several baby wearing instructors that tucking something between you and baby is pointless. Cooling towels work by evaporation, and are much more effective if you put them where air can get to them. They recommended one on the back of your neck, and one that you can easily put on baby's neck and remove it again if baby gets too cold. Obviously if you are back carrying you may want to put your towel somewhere else (e.g. tucked across your upper chest between tank top straps) so baby doesn't grab it."
babywearing,3a484a,keeksg,6,Wed Jun 17 11:44:20 2015 UTC,"This is so true and such a common misconception.  The cooling towel will do nothing between the two of you but make you wet and keep you hot.  When I first used mine, I used it like that.  We were at the Grand Canyon in July, it was hot as heck and my son got heat rash.  Since then, I have used it by just draping it over and it works so much better.  If you are wearing in warmer weather, just be sure to take breaks to cool off and drink a lot.  The Frogg Togg is nice and cooling when used right though."
babywearing,3a484a,effinga,2,Wed Jun 17 13:38:05 2015 UTC,"We bought a ""chilly towel"". It's a towel that stays cold for hours. I just tuck it in the sling."

babywearing,3a484a,shadeofmyheart,2,Wed Jun 17 05:55:01 2015 UTC,I think I read somewhere that frog toggs shouldn't be used between baby and mom in a carrier because they work by wicking moisture and evaporating so they need to be in open air. But I don't remember where I read it.

babywearing,3a1i7s,The-Beef,6,Tue Jun 16 14:26:24 2015 UTC,I found gauze wraps to be very 'sticky' and hard to adjust. A solid cotton one slides much much better.
babywearing,3a1i7s,bebbykins,6,Tue Jun 16 15:51:53 2015 UTC,Gauze wraps are definitely diggy and not great with larger babies. There is a Mexican woven wrap seller on etsy that is cheap. Didymos indio wraps tho are my favorite for beginners and they hold value so can be resold.
babywearing,3a1i7s,NotQuiteVanilla,3,Tue Jun 16 15:59:35 2015 UTC,Woven wraps are all about learning to tighten properly.  Wrapyouinlove is my favourite youtuber
babywearing,3a1i7s,Dev-Lyn,2,Tue Jun 16 15:46:02 2015 UTC,There is definitely a learning curve with woven wraps. I watched all the videos I could find but didn't get comfortable until some experts helped me troubleshoot. Are there any groups in your community that could help you out face to face? The striped wraps are nice to adjust because you can see what stripe you need to pull on to adjust things while wrapped.
babywearing,3a1i7s,OOmama,2,Tue Jun 16 15:00:30 2015 UTC,"What carry are you using? Unfortunately, the thinner the material, the diggy-er it is going to be. I've never used a gauze wrap before, though. I would think that if you were careful to spread everything, it shouldn't be diggy."
babywearing,3a1i7s,momonomicon,2,Tue Jun 16 15:49:44 2015 UTC,Gauze wraps are really not comfortable with babies 15 lbs and up. If you are looking for something cooler a wool wrap would be a good option because it is a breathable fabric.
babywearing,3a1i7s,MustacheBus,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:08:06 2015 UTC,"i never found a gauze wrap to be cooler than a cotton one, especially since with a heavier baby you need multiple passes with the gauze material, and it does get diggy after awhile.  try a cotton one like little frog, chimparoo, etc before you give up on wovens!"
babywearing,3a1i7s,nichole123,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:03:12 2015 UTC,"I have a DIY gauze wrap, but my baby is only 10 lbs right now.  I don't find it diggy, but I am careful to spread the fabric as wide as possible over my back and shoulders.  My favorite carry is front cross carry, as I find that much easier to adjust once baby is on.  I can see it getting uncomfortable as baby gets heavier though, so I'm going to invest in a cotton or linen wrap in a few more months.  Luckily that'll be when the weather cools off because I can't imagine using anything heaver than gauze right now."
babywearing,3a1i7s,elviebird,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:08:35 2015 UTC,"Gauze was my first woven wrap. It is hard and diggy when you don't wrap properly. It doesn't budge once you wrap. I used it for my baby's first nine months while saving up to buy a woven made of cotton. Cotton is definitely softer, easier to maneuver and more cushy. But I learned how to wrap properly and carefully because of my gauze wrap. Check out littlefrog for great cotton and linen wraps, I got my woven for $80 with shipping and everything!"
babywearing,3a1i7s,ree189,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:32:59 2015 UTC,Yeah gauze is not great in my opinion. Don't give up. Given a cotton woven a go! So much better. A Little Frog brand is a budget option and keep checking the B/S/S groups.

I'm very plus sized (US 30) and with my body shape, I can't wrap around baby in the front to tie in the back, but I know someone who is a 26/28 and they can wrap around the front no problem.   I love it even without that."
babywearing,39lkwq,2ndstartotheright,7,Fri Jun 12 16:14:41 2015 UTC,"Looks like he's a bit small for it - his knees should bend easily. I would try tying a ribbon or scarf around the bottom of the panel to cinch it in a bit, otherwise his legs could be hyper extended. Love the print!"
babywearing,39lkwq,silentcecilia,5,Fri Jun 12 16:59:00 2015 UTC,"Check with Tula directly first before cinching - I believe they don't recommend it because of the abnormal stress that it puts on stitching on the panel, and the fact that cinching a padded waist carrier tends to cause it to fit differently than a Mei tai. Your baby should be able to bend knees freely in the carrier. General recommendation for toddler Tula is for babies to be at least 18 months and 25 lb, and generally wearing size 2t pants. If the Toddler isn't fitting right now, it would be more appropriate to buy or borrow the standard size until your little one is older."
babywearing,39lkwq,raspberry_lonestarr,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:11:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for some reason he kept shifting over to the right, so that leg was super dangly and the other one stuck straight out. Will try your tip so he can't do that!"

babywearing,39lkwq,user97806,3,Fri Jun 12 17:45:42 2015 UTC,"Next time, make sure he is in the ""M"" position. Then pull the straps a little tighter to help prevent him from sliding around too much. If you are having issues tightening the straps, they will get easier overtime, you may also wish to invest in reach straps. Tulas are not supposed to be cinched."
babywearing,39lkwq,Jennylorraine,2,Sat Jun 13 03:11:38 2015 UTC,"do you put kiddo in it, and then put it all on like a backpack?  also HEB!!!!"
babywearing,39lkwq,unassuming_angst,2,Fri Jun 12 17:43:22 2015 UTC,"Sort of. You strap the bottom around your waist, put one strap on, load kiddo onto the opposite hip and then slide him/her in onto your back and cinch up the other side. I still have to do it while leaning way forward and looking into some sort of reflective surface to feel confident I won't lose him, but that's just my nerves."

babywearing,39elqx,beanbaconsoup,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:48:25 2015 UTC,Try looking for a little frog or Lenny lamb wrap in a size 6. They are affordable and usually pretty soft right out of the bag.
babywearing,39elqx,Jennchilada,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:40:23 2015 UTC,"I'd go for a size 6 or 7 wrap, and get 100% cotton or a cotton/linen blend. Or 100% linen if it's really hot where you are. Oscha have nice thin linen wraps though they can be expensive. Little Frog make cheap, high quality cotton wraps that are excellent for beginners, though you may find that 100% cotton gets a bit hot in summer."
babywearing,39elqx,dalikin,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:02:17 2015 UTC,"Check what fibers the wrap you're getting has! My first wrap was a broken in Lenny Lamb bamboo blend, and while it was beautiful and soft, it was slippery as heck. I failed a lot of tries at carries; in hindsight because it had no grab and I had no idea what I was doing. I had no idea how slippery it was until I got my second wrap, which is a Tekhni.   I can't talk up Tekhni enough. The Arche line - Sunset, Storm, Peacock - are specifically made for new wrappers with small babies. They are very thin and breathable (despite feeling plasticky before the first recommended wash, which made me nervous), and they are VERY grabby. It's SO easy to wrap compared to my LL bamboo blend!"

babywearing,38g9sv,OOmama,6,Thu Jun 4 00:53:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies.  :)  My wrap is cotton gauze from fabric.com.  It was 3.95 a yard.  The only thing I don't like is that it's rather rough and a bit scratchy feeling, but baby doesn't seem to mind.  I really just wanted something that didn't cost a small fortune and was also cool since I'm in Georgia.  I also have a Moby that I like, but it's too hot to wear out right now.  With my daughter I had a Babyhawk meitei but ended up selling it.  It was just too bulky and a pain to carry around.  I'd love to be able to master nursing in the wrap!"

babywearing,38g9sv,HornOfDagoth,6,Thu Jun 4 04:40:41 2015 UTC,"One of the (few) shitty things about parenting is that you will be judged for something - for everything - no matter what it is you are choosing on what topic.  That said, all the ppl I've encountered within babywearing groups are very friendly and I've only seen them get borderline judgy about issues that don't have clear safety guidelines (like tying over the spine for newborns w/a mei tei - this is regulation-approved, company guidelines in the US but many people feel one should tie lower).   Nobody should judge you for making your own wrap or not having something fancy. :)"
babywearing,38g9sv,mama_stay,2,Thu Jun 4 09:38:54 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're going to one of the Atlanta area meetings? That's a great group. While the mods and a few others have these incredible stashes, many others don't, and I've never seen judgement towards any type of wrap (or any mom). I never had anything more than a Moby and just borrowed from their library. Any self-consciousness I felt was my own doing."
babywearing,38g9sv,texas_momma,2,Thu Jun 4 12:56:55 2015 UTC,I don't think you'll be judged at all! I've gone to a couple local BWI meetings and everyone there was super friendly and helpful. I made my own wrap and ring slings as well and they just commented on how pretty they were (I dyed them).
babywearing,38g9sv,binbougami,2,Thu Jun 4 15:02:58 2015 UTC,"My first wrap was this cheap little Mexican wrap. It is super long but very thin. I rather like it and haven't parted ways with it. I mean, I learned to wrap in that wrap! I took all my wraps with me to a local BWI wrapping workshop and for the carry we were learning she recommended using the longest wrap you have, and mine is a little longer than a 6 so that was what got used.   I was worried about it since these people had some very nice handwovens and clearly had spent lots of money but she VBE actually commented to the whole group that my wrap was perfect for this carry since it is thinner making it easier to work with. I was proud of my little wrap in that moment and it did make for an excellent carry!"

babywearing,38dmwe,motherofdragoons,4,Wed Jun 3 15:11:06 2015 UTC,Have you thought about going with a wrap? The advantage to going with something like a size 7 wrap would be that there is plenty of fabric to work with and you have a ton of options between the two of you to find a position that feels comfortable. SSC's can be really comfortable if you have one that fits you both well but my wife doesn't like how the buckles fit her.
babywearing,38dmwe,geekathair,3,Wed Jun 3 16:31:11 2015 UTC,"I don't use wraps or slings, I'm a soft structured carrier mom and I have back problems and have no problem with my Tula and didn't have problems with my ergo when LO was small. I would recommend a carrier that has a taller back since you have larger boobs and hubby is tall. I'm 5'7'' too, don't have large boobs but my 6'3'' hubby can where my standard size Tula no problem. Congrats momma!:)"
babywearing,38dmwe,GinJon,2,Wed Jun 3 16:15:17 2015 UTC,"I personally like wraps, they are the ultimate convertible type - meaning you can do front, back, hip carries and it is a custom fit every time. The downside is it is a huge learning curve and most dads prefer simplicity as well. I would recommend a Soft structured carrier (Tula, ergo, boba) or a ring sling to try out first. Also if you look up ""Ottawa baby wearing group"" they have a blog post somewhere where they took pictures of different carriers on different body types. It is really helpful! Good luck!"
babywearing,38dmwe,ree189,2,Wed Jun 3 18:22:34 2015 UTC,"I think a Tula would be fine. Another option is a Kinderpack with plus size straps.  That basically just means that the padded part of the strap is as long as that of a Tula. Honestly, I'm sure most sscs will be fine in a pinch. If you end up wearing a lot you'll probably want to buy two carriers eventually so you're not always adjusting the straps. :) We had a Boba 4g, then my husband stole my Tula because it was more comfortable for him and I eventually got a kp."

babywearing,38dmwe,OOmama,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:49:29 2015 UTC,"A wrap, size 6 or 7 would be an excellent choice. Both you and your husband would be able to wrap how you each prefer. I'd see if you can borrow a size 7 wrap to test it out."

(I do have the black color though so that probably didn't help either.)  I haven't really looked much at the active, but if I were to buy again I'd either do that or the breeze, especially for only $10 more.  Also just a note on the k'tan, pay close attention to the sizing chart.  I'm normally a medium, but my k'tan is a small and worked great from newborn to even now at 18 months we still use it once in a while.  I LOVE mine and everyone I've seen talk about not loving theirs seems to have ordered too large."

babywearing,37vrpj,Jigglypops,8,Sat May 30 20:26:35 2015 UTC,"You're in London? I think there are tons of baby wearing groups in London. Try this as a start: https://ukslinglibraries.wordpress.com/find-a-sling-library-near-you/  I looked at a couple of random regions, and most of them seem to have meetups at their ""libraries"" where they can teach you.  I used a K'Tan - I found the newborn/kangaroo carry in it really awkward and uncomfortable. I switched straight to the hug position, and my son was SO much happier, and I felt more confident that he could breathe and was in a good, upright TICKS position."
babywearing,37vrpj,keeksg,1 point,Sat May 30 21:03:51 2015 UTC,"With the K'tan, are you doing the kangaroo position? I much preferred the hug position. I think the booklet says to wait until two months for that one, but I started doing it at 2 weeks and I felt like it just put my baby in a much better position. With the kangaroo he would kind of want to curl up and then his chin would all be in his chest, so not good at all. I think the hug is easier to get into too, although it looks more complicated, it really isn't."
babywearing,37vrpj,onemosphere,1 point,Sat May 30 21:14:21 2015 UTC,"Try putting her in the newborn hug hold in the k'tan and simply going for a walk so you can get used to the feel and see how she shifts and reacts to movement. Once you can anticipate what he little body is or isn't going to do in the carrier that'll give you the confidence to do more things. Also, I had a thirteen month old when my son was born and dad worked 4 hours away so there were definitely times I had him in a carrier and she wanted up for a snuggle. I PROMISE you aren't going to inadvertently squish your baby just wearing her."

When I first started I was pretty paranoid that I hadn't tied it tight enough,his head wasn't supported etc etc.I walked around with a hand on his back most of the time 'just in case'.I also felt like I was doing it all wrong,mainly because all the videos I watched made it look easy and I was out of breath by the time I had got wrapped and got him in :D.I kept trying though and it really did get easier,I also got a lot more confident about him being safe and secure.  Just try doing it for short periods around the house at first,then maybe a quick trip to the local shop etc etc.  Also just remembered that I tried it with a teddy first!Its obviously not the same as a baby but it helped me feel a bit more confident with the process before I tried it with baby.you should definitely try this a few times!  Good luck :D"

Don't give up on babywearing! I loved newborn hug hold with K'Tan when my baby was teeny weenie. She's now 4 months and we're doing mei tais and woven wraps. Even if you set aside the carriers until she is a little older and able to keep her head up better, that's okay!   Also, it does take some getting used to. My baby keeps her head up pretty well now, but I still check her airway quite often while wearing."

I went to a local babywearing meet-up and like others have mentioned, they suggested I wear LO in the hug position instead of kangaroo. I still felt iffy about it, though. So, I just made myself practice it for at least 10-15 minutes every day and within 2 weeks it was second nature!"

And they calm down a bit more then."
babywearing,37urms,ethereal_pixie,1 point,Sat May 30 16:52:17 2015 UTC,You're probably right about him being tired. He looked like he had just woken up when I got him out of the car seat this morning.

babywearing,37urms,momonomicon,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:19:52 2015 UTC,"Yep. You might try a couple different things, there is probably something bugging him that you're not aware of. For my daughter, she just wanted to see everything. The only way I could wear her was forward facing. Sometimes I could get away with her on my side.  But, have you tried wearing him out, yet? He might be more calm when he's looking at a new environment. My daughter was."
babywearing,37urms,momonomicon,1 point,Sat May 30 18:35:30 2015 UTC,"His head is still pretty wobbly sometimes so I don't think I can forward face him yet. I pretty much only wear him out, very rarely do I wear him at home unless I'm trying to do something in the garden. When he was tiny I was doing legs in (didn't know that it was no longer recommended) and since I switched to legs out he's been less calm no matter how I adjust the fabric. Maybe I'm doing something wrong..."
babywearing,37urms,donnamatrix79,1 point,Sat May 30 18:40:34 2015 UTC,"If legs in works, I would do it. A lot of the stuff nitpicking minor positional things are inflammatory in my opinion. When I started researching this stuff when I was pregnant with my daughter (11 months) legs in was the recommendation. I could never get it to work and did legs out anyway.  Just make sure his legs are m shaped and weight is supported on his butt, not his knees or feet."

As tiny grubs they're totally happy to be worn, and then as they approach 1 and beyond they love being carried whether in my arms or a carrier. Of course they'd protest the most when wearing them is really the most necessary. When it gets particularly bad I try to wear them around the house extra, especially at nap time, and sometimes they give up and embrace it. Though definitely not always. Good luck!"

babywearing,37bhem,inkymittens,5,Tue May 26 12:04:08 2015 UTC,"Honest advice for a beginner - unless you really know what what you're doing with a sewing machine, don't diy. For two reaons: 1, it'll take you a while to figure out what you're doing, and it sucks starting over if you screw up and 2, if you don't notice that you're screwing up, you could be putting your baby in danger. For example, the cotton you have could be too thin and not be able to bear weight for very long. If the result is a sudden tear, your baby could fall. That is probably unlikely, but obviously something we want to prevent. DIY wraps tend to be made of osnaburg or cotton gauze, two fabrics with a slight stretch on the diagonal similar to woven wraps. This isn't something you can't do, I just recommend putting a lot of time and effort in to make sure it is done right.  Now, all that opinion aside, here are some tips. Sleeping baby productions has a free ring sling pattern on her site, along with lots and lots of information on fabrics and techniques. If you need to hem your material, get a rolled hem foot for your machine. The biggest one you can find. It's difficult to get used to, and you have to go slowly, but you don't have to pin and iron all of that length. It saves a ton of time.    As far as the cross body bag, I've managed to make it work. I out the bag on first, then tie for front cross carry, and then add baby. Your wrap wont be long enough for fcc, but its the same principle. It isn't ideal though, I personally just have my husband carry my bag, or carry it in my hand if he isn't with me. A lot of people use backpacks."
babywearing,37bhem,momonomicon,1 point,Tue May 26 13:33:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think 2.5 meters is nearly long enough to wrap with. Most start with a size 6, which is 4.6 meters. When you say cotton,  that could mean a lot of different weaves and weights. Is it thin like a bed sheet?"
babywearing,37bhem,fading_fad,2,Tue May 26 14:20:17 2015 UTC,"2.5 is roughly a size 2 wrap (just a wee bit short). You could rebozo with it, front torso carry, and no sew ring sling to name a few.   A longer size would probably be easier but the size 2 will not make it impossible for you to wear."
babywearing,37bhem,teachthetwerps,1 point,Tue May 26 18:07:20 2015 UTC,Yeah but it will be even shorter with washing and hemming.
babywearing,37bhem,fading_fad,1 point,Tue May 26 18:15:13 2015 UTC,Still not impossible. Rebozo can be done with less. So can a no see new ring sling. I'm just trying to make sure she knows there are options for wearing with a piece of fabric that short.

babywearing,36n8xr,srhiannonjones,2,Wed May 20 19:13:41 2015 UTC,"Totally buy used! That way others have done the breaking in for you. Lenny Lamb is lovely, so are a lot of others. Do you have a BWI chapter near you? If so, join and you can try wraps to find one you like before buying."
babywearing,36n8xr,katt42,2,Wed May 20 22:47:48 2015 UTC,I got a girasol for my newborn. Honestly after a couple of washes and a bit of time in the sun they soften up very well.  Buying used is also a good option as it's already broken in that way.
babywearing,36n8xr,beanbaconsoup,2,Thu May 21 03:55:26 2015 UTC,"Buy a Tekhni! No lie....THE BEST WRAP I'VE USED! I've tried Girasol  and own a few Oschas, but I won't buy anything bit Tekhni now. Legit awesome! Repreve is amazing!!!!  Edit: They are all under $200 brand new and there is no breaking in with repreve. It is soft right out if the bag!"

babywearing,36j62d,papertowelboats,4,Tue May 19 19:49:12 2015 UTC,"Most of us have multiple carriers, because there isn't just one that works for everything.  To answer your questions. Yes, your baby should be pretty high up. Above your breasts, for sure.   For a southern summer, you will want something really light. I would recommend a ring sling made of linen. Yes, ring slings get more uncomfortable for big babies (like 15-20 pounds) but that is months away. Ring slings are small and light, and easy to pack in the diaper bag.  When your baby gets bigger, you could switch to a soft structured carrier like an ergo. The pros are that they are super easy to use, and really comfortable. I love my Tula, but you can't use it until your baby is at least 15 pounds.   Of course, then there is wrapping, which is a whole other discussion!"
babywearing,36j62d,fading_fad,5,Tue May 19 20:56:12 2015 UTC,"I have a k' tan and I really like it. It is easy to get off and on, and my baby  loves it. His afternoon nap is usually in the k'tan because he falls asleep instantly and then I can get some stuff done. That being said, it does kind of suck that it is sized and both my husband and I can't wear it. However, I am the one home all day on maternity leave while the husband is back at work, so it was more important to me that it work for me. I also don't think my husband would have futzed with a sling if we went that route. Now that the babe is getting a bit bigger, I just ordered a Beco Gemini in the hopes that both my husband and I can use it. I will still definitely use the k'tan though, cause I love that thing. It was just getting lots of love at my mom's group too."
babywearing,36j62d,onemosphere,3,Tue May 19 21:14:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, and K'tan. I personally think its s waste of money. Its a sized carrier, which means you and your husband can't share it. Its expensive for what it is. It has almost no resale value. Its stretchy, so it will only be supportive until your baby is about 15 pounds. Maybe look for a used one if you really want one?"
babywearing,36j62d,fading_fad,4,Tue May 19 21:00:13 2015 UTC,We just joined Babywearing International. With membership we can borrow a different carrier every month for a year & get expert advice. You should check and see if there's one by you!  My kid is a June baby. We liked the Moby for when he was first born- 4 months. We often use a boba ssc now too. I'm trying to get into wraps now :). Congrats and good luck!
babywearing,36j62d,OOmama,3,Tue May 19 22:42:46 2015 UTC,"What do you think you will primarily use it for? What will be good outside in the summer is completely different than what will be good inside for naps, which will be different for running errands.  I think a ring sling is a good start. It is great for the heat, great for quick ups and downs. Not so great for wearing for long term or with older babies. If you have back problems, you might want to avoid it. I keep mine in my diaper bag. It has come on handy quite a few times when I'm out grocery shopping and it runs a little long and my (24 lb) daughter decides she needs to be held.  The ergo will feel less bulky once your baby is bigger. I've been looking into SSCs recently, and as far as I can tell the ergo and the canvas tula are pretty similar in general fit. The tula comes in fancy patterns and colors.   I've never used a stretchy wrap because I decided to get a woven instead. If I did, I would probably get the k'tan. Ease of getting the baby in is important. It took me 2 or 3 months to get comfortable with my ring sling, and a bit longer for my woven. Now I'm a pro, and for my next baby I'm all set, but I probably would've worn my daughter more if I had something that didn't leave so much room for user error."
babywearing,36j62d,momonomicon,3,Tue May 19 21:44:38 2015 UTC,TICKS guidelines http://frangipanibaby.mobile034.com/g/1131069/babywearing-safety.html  A ring sling is great for a newborn.  Tulas are a bit big for a newborn but you can use a rolled up cloth nappy as a booster. A manduca comes with an inbuilt newborn insert. I like my ergo.  Honestly the best way to know what you want is to try. Most carriers retain their value so you can sell on something you don't like.

For the record, I have a linen ring sling for my 7 week old. I'm still not ""getting it"" tho,  so I use my infanito SSC more. But its not super comfy and LO doesn't like frog legging it.

babywearing,36j62d,AlexasaurusRex,2,Wed May 20 16:39:56 2015 UTC,"My baby was born in summer in a very hot area. I have mild back issues, so I opted for a more symmetrical carrier - a stretchy wrap made from a light t-shirt like material. It was just fine despite the heat and it's easy to keep on the whole day and just take baby in/out as necessary. I think a more lycra-like stretchy wrap might get too hot, though.   Mei Tais are also comfy in heat because it's a relatively thin panel of fabric going over the baby, usually with some gaping at the sides. My baby started riding in a Mei Tai (front carry) at about 5 weeks.   Now that she's older (15 months, 11.5kg), I carry her in front with an Ergo if she might nap and on my back in a Mei Tai if we take a walk."
babywearing,36j62d,Zoraptera,2,Wed May 20 11:40:50 2015 UTC,"When my little one was very small, and even now (just a few days from one year old), I really liked the Moby  wrap. It looks confusing like all wraps at first, but you get to the point that you can tie a secure wrap in about a minute. The Maya ring sling is a great choice, but it too has an adjustment period. I also have an Ergo. It isn't really bulky at all and is so fast and easy to carry. It's also the most comfortable carrier for me. It's very adjustable to accommodate men and women and quick to do so. Tulas are amazing. That's what I hope to get (a toddler Tula) once my little one gets all giant and still wants to be worn. Start slow. Go with a traditional wrap like the Moby which is very inexpensive. You can often buy things to try second hand too. Babywearing on a Budget on Facebook is a great place to look. You can also join Babywearing International that might have some local meet up for you and you can try on all the different carriers/ wraps and even rent them. Great organization."
babywearing,36j62d,annaeatscupcakes,2,Wed May 20 11:44:49 2015 UTC,I personally love my K'tan for around the house. She naps great in it. I'm starting to get less use out of it now that she's bigger but it saved my life in the beginning. As far SSC's go I love my lillebaby. It can be used without an infant insert from about 8lbs. I have the all seasons and it does seem a bit cooler than my ergo. I definitely agree with the recommendation to find a baby wearing group and try before you buy. If I had done this first I probably would have skipped the Ergo though I know a lot of people love them. It's all about finding the one that's most comfortable for you.
babywearing,36j62d,petitechat85,2,Wed May 20 14:08:14 2015 UTC,"Huge upvotes to the comments about local babywearing groups! Those are definitely the place to check things out.  I liked the K'Tan with my son from birth (preemie) to the point where I got more comfortable wrapping. My husband and I did end up being the same size, and he still likes the K'Tan, but his main desire is quick up/downs, so he's otherwise a buckle carrier guy.  I want so badly to be able to use a ring sling, but my son is a perpetual leg-straightener, so he needs a more reinforced seat. We do better with wraps, mei tais, and SSCs.  I would skip stretchy wraps and go straight to wovens, if you want to wrap! They have a learning curve, but are so versatile!  For SSCs, we love our Beco Gemini. I also love my Boba 4g, but I miss having straps that cross in the back. My first Tula is supposed to arrive tomorrow. :) But SSCs are like jeans; they fit everyone differently, and parents might prefer different ones.  For wraps and ring slings that are perhaps slightly more affordable, good in heat, and still safe and well-made, I recommend Grace & Eugene on Etsy or FoxBabyDesigns on Etsy. These are both CPSIA compliant members of the BCIA, which means their products meet industry safety standards! Another nice thing about wraps is you can wrap your belly now and postpartum for support; there are videos on YouTube. :)  Mei tais are in between a wrap and an SSC; they have a panel but tie with straps. Right now my absolute favorite is the Chimparoo mei tai. I've also used the Infantino, which is cheap and sturdy and perfectly acceptable.  Happy Babywearing!!!"
babywearing,36ki3j,owlsayshoot,5,Wed May 20 01:28:53 2015 UTC,"She needs time to get used to it. Keep trying every day for a few minutes. It will get better! Meanwhile, see if you can go to a meeting (babywearinginternational.com) and have someone check to make sure you're doing things right, also ask about cradle carry, she might like that better."
babywearing,36ki3j,silentcecilia,2,Wed May 20 03:41:20 2015 UTC,Cradle carry can be very difficult to do safely. It's not recommended for newborns or young babies with little head and neck control because of the risk of positional asphyxiation.
babywearing,36ki3j,raspberry_lonestarr,7,Wed May 20 12:28:43 2015 UTC,"That's why I recommended going to a meeting, not trying alone at home. Cradle can be perfectly safe when done correctly, and if she learns from a BWI pro, it could be a good option. Fearmongering usually just leads to people giving up or trying something alone to avoid judgement. It's much more constructive to offer safe ways to try."

babywearing,36ki3j,raspberry_lonestarr,4,Wed May 20 11:21:13 2015 UTC,"Babywearing is a learned skill for babies too! I found that with my babes, getting moving right away and a change in location helped - I used to go outside for a walk right away. Especially if you're new to wearing and taking some time to adjust fit, make sure that she's fed, happy and clean when you put her in the carrier.   Also, does she wear footie pajamas when you wear her? The way that those can ride up in carriers sometimes place pressure on the bottom of their feet, causing discomfort and making them straighten their legs. Try her in shirts and leggings with no feet."
babywearing,36ki3j,KayThere12,2,Wed May 20 12:26:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much, this really helps. I guess I just figured, she likes to be held so much, wearing will be natural!

Sometimes certain carriers are better for certain tasks. You can probably resell your ring sling if you decide against it to someone in that babywearing class."
babywearing,36ccf0,eveyamadeus,3,Mon May 18 06:51:57 2015 UTC,Agreed. The ringsling has its benefits but wraps or SSCs like ergos or Tulas win out for me. Wraps are highly adjustable and spread the weight out well. SSCs are slightly less adjustable and don't spread weight quite as well but are much easier to take them in and out quickly.
babywearing,36ccf0,sasha_says,2,Mon May 18 06:59:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your input - sounds like everyone's on the same page. I think I'll keep the ring sling around but look into getting a SSC too. I was worried it would be a bit excessive given that I also have a stroller, but different tools for different jobs is a better perspective. I can see pros and cons to each.  Edit: further on the 'excessive' front, I also have an old Baby Bjorn that a friend gave me. She used it when her now-teenagers were little, and loved it, and can't seem to understand why I don't love it too! So I was wondering if I was being too fussy. But the Bjorn drags on my shoulders, has too many fiddly bits (seems to be from the era before plastic clips) and baby doesn't seem to like it either!"
babywearing,36ccf0,eveyamadeus,1 point,Mon May 18 22:54:55 2015 UTC,"Baby bjorn is okay if thats all you have access to. If you can afford it, get a tula. They are so comfortable in comparison to other ssc. Ive tried many. Buy from amazon if you can, they have a great return policy. Also, it's always better to try before you buy. See if someone local has one they will let you borrow for a few days. Its always better to test it in real life situations than to try on once at a babywearing meeting."

My 7 month old is heavy and like back carries vs front so I don't grab it often, but it is good for snuggles Lol.  You may need to adjust a lot to find your sweet spot in the ring sling, it took me a little while. I know I spread his legs and move him more to my hip and get it really tight and bounce a lot to get a good seat he can't straighten his legs out of. That way if I bend he is also at my hip and doesn't feel like he is falling off of me.  If you have the $ maybe keep it as a backup and get a SSC, or sell it and fund a SSC (I love my Kinderpack, Tulas are very similar, and a lot of people like Ergos too at a cheaper price)"

babywearing,36ccf0,dinahsaurus,2,Mon May 18 23:01:22 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that a carrier for all of your needs doesn't really exist.  You want something lightweight, small, non figety, easy to use, and be able to do chores in.    The most important is use case: chores.  That narrows it down quickly to a SSC (Ergo, Tula, etc), Mai Tai (these have no buckles, just ties, but otherwise like a lightweight SSC), and Woven Wrap (super high learning curve, but folds up small and gauze wraps are very lightweight and versatile).  In my opinion, Ergo, Tula, Boba, Beco, etc are incredibly popular for good reason.  Try one of them."

babywearing,36ap7y,icedroplets,2,Sun May 17 21:46:56 2015 UTC,"Could be a few things. I've found the easiest way to pop a seat is tightening too much. It's ok if the seat is a little loose, as long as everything else is nice and tight. Are you making sure the seat goes knee to knee?   Is there a specific reason you want to do fwcc? Because I started out with fwcc, then found fcc and never looked back. It is just so much easier for me."
babywearing,36ap7y,momonomicon,1 point,Sun May 17 23:46:45 2015 UTC,"The one benefit of FWCC is that there's only one layer of fabric over babe's back, so it seems more summer-appropriate. It's pretty hot and humid here, so I'm trying to keep us both as cool as possible.  The seat does go knee to knee, but it's possible I have the bottom rail too tight.

babywearing,369s4o,momonomicon,2,Sun May 17 18:09:53 2015 UTC,If she's 4 months old and the trip isn't for a little while she shouldn't need the infant insert anymore for the Ergo. Maybe just something to boost up her bum but her head control shouldn't require the pillow. Would a ring sling be a good option. You can loosen it and turn her sideways to nurse and it's fast ups and downs.
babywearing,369s4o,racerocks,1 point,Sun May 17 16:38:26 2015 UTC,"I find the ring sling really easy to use on trips: it is light to carry (not a lot of fabric), easy ups and downs, quite easy to breastfeed with and not too warm (only one layer of fabric).

I love the Ergo for traveling, at 4 months we could use it worth just a rolled blanket under the bum.  CPH airport was pretty great with me wearing him through security and they actually didn't make me remove him! If you have to make a connection in Europe and go through security again, you most likely will have to take babe out of a carrier/wrap and send it through the scanner. They have made me do this in Paris and Amsterdam every time, it's horribly mean IMO.  You'll have to remove the baby from any carrier for taxi, takeoff and landing in the plane. That's why I like a buckle carrier, because it's easier that re-wrapping in a small space."

Be ready to click and just get whatever you can, if your wife doesn't like it she can trade it. You can also look on Facebook on the baby wearing swap or tula carriers b/s/t if you don't score. They have some wc Tulas for sale for close to retail (and some way over retail.)  If you want to get her a canvas one they restock those randomly and are $149.   The wovens and ring slings are made from the woven material. The wraps are wrapped around the body and baby and knotted, some people love them, I never got the hang of them. The ring slings are an easy way for ups and downs, some people don't like them as the baby gets bigger. They don't distribute the weight as well as a buckle carrier, but they are cooler and easy for short carries.   I don't know much about kinder packs. They have more sizes, and a cool knit material panel some say help keep it cooler. But I do know they are hard to get like the Tulas.   Good luck. Let me know if you have any other questions."

There are people that try at every single stocking for months (even up to a couple years I've seen) and never get one.   It's quite ridiculous."
babywearing,369cxe,Axora,2,Sun May 17 19:01:02 2015 UTC,"I blind clicked and scored my first stocking. I had my iPad, my husband was on his chrome book and we had his phone as back up. We started refreshing the pages at 5:55 pm. At 6:00 I yelled: click! Click! Click! I somehow scored one. I have not scored since in the 5 months I have tried, but I also have not tried as seriously as that day. The adrenaline rush was like coming out of a fight victorious."

babywearing,369cxe,MustacheBus,1 point,Sun May 17 23:02:15 2015 UTC,"Tulas and KP's tend to be pretty similar, it's all about what fits best for each person. Both have great resell and trade value, so if you get your wife one that she doesn't like she will easily be able to swap or sell it to get one that she does like. Check out the Tulapedia.com, they have a list and map of retailers and online stores that carry Tulas. Maybe there's a retailer near you that has them.  I've heard Tulas can be a bit hot because of the canvas, KP's make a lot of theirs with a cool knit mesh which I've heard is great. KP stockings are every Thursday at 1pm est and like the Tula stockings they sell out in seconds.  The buy sell trade Facebook groups are always an option as well, though you will be paying above retail almost always.  Good luck! :)"

We had a Kelty carrier, similar to the one you linked to at REI. It was nice for my husband, but I could not carry my son in it past 18 months or so. I'm 5'3"" and it threw me WAY off balance.  As long as we didn't need extra packing room, we opted for an Ergo (I'd investigate Tula's too now, which weren't an option that we knew about when our kids were still ""piggy-backers"" and not hikers themselves!). The Ergos were more comfortable and made us feel a little more stable on more difficult trails. And when we added another baby to the mix, we just added another Ergo.   I usually carried the baby on the front (so he could nurse) and a decent sized pack on my back...while my husband carried our toddler in an Ergo on his back.   Our normal hikes were only 3-5 miles with the kiddos though, so we didn't need a lot of cargo space for food, etc. Terrain was mixed from Mountains to Beaches, mostly in the UK and Europe."

babywearing,35quil,punchyourfacein,1 point,Tue May 12 20:38:10 2015 UTC,Here's a YouTube video of the carry.  https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&ei=UGdSVf3OCda1sQTfo4G4Cw&url=http://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DzbIDDpMxx6w&ved=0CCMQtwIwAA&usg=AFQjCNEO8mkVnKLVqbvG5b8_WQw1o2eKOA&sig2=DBpwIPgDMCzbiS69AscXkw  The chair variation is where you spread the wrap over a chair and have kiddo sit on the spread out wrap. It will be spread over the kid exactly how it would be if you spread it with the kid on your back. Sit on the chair with kid behind your back and grab both rails. Pull them tight as you stand up and kid will slide into your back. Then just follow the video from there. My son is such a wiggly baby and it's the only way I can do a back carry unless my husband helps me.

They don't Outgrow a standard for a really long time. I have a 23lb 10 month old and she's a perfect fit in my standard. I'd also look into a standard Kinder pack. They still have 2 more sizes above that, also if you're worried about outgrowing it."

babywearing,35pgll,merveilleuse_,5,Tue May 12 18:45:04 2015 UTC,"Please note, the baby in the photo is too small for the Toddler Tula.  His legs don't swing freely, and it comes up too high by his head.  It also looks like the panel has wrinkles, showing it's not snug across his back.  On the Tula site, they suggest 18 months and 32 inches.  Your baby's not there yet, and using a carrier that is too big can be dangerous.  I'd go for a standard Tula, which is bigger than many standard carriers, or look into a different, smaller toddler carrier, like the Rose and Rebellion inbetweener."
babywearing,35pgll,redj41,1 point,Tue May 12 19:02:56 2015 UTC,"FWIT, OP says their baby is 32"", so meets the size requirement no problem.  The age requirement works on the size of an average baby.  My kiddo's pediatrician has told us to focus on weight and length requirements, not age, when it comes to clothes, car seats, carriers, etc.  My baby is also in the 90%+ for baby size.  Age requirements are more important for toys and developmental products."
babywearing,35pgll,merveilleuse_,2,Sat May 16 01:25:46 2015 UTC,"Yep, sorry, for some reason I got it into my head that the baby was 30"", not 32"", but weight is suggested from 25 lbs, close, but not there yet.  While size and weight are more important than age for carriers, I still think this child is too small for a toddler Tula.  A too small carrier might get uncomfortable; a too big one is dangerous."
babywearing,35pgll,redj41,1 point,Sat May 16 01:41:20 2015 UTC,"You are right about the weight.  I misread that as 29 pounds.  We both read that wrong.  Anyway, I also recommended the standard tula, because the extra 5 pounds of weight the toddler tula carries doesn't seem worth the extra 30$, especially if your baby is large and growing fast."
babywearing,35pgll,pinkpowerranger8,2,Sat May 16 02:46:18 2015 UTC,"I totally think you should try to find a lending group. I'm not saying he won't fit in a toddler  it's just that most don't for quite a while...  Like into 2 and 3 year old.  And they don't Outgrow a standard for a while also,  like 4t pants. There's a very large overlap period.  With as expensive as the carriers can be and as hard as they can be to get your hands on,  a lending library would be super helpful to make a decision! :)  Goodluck!"

babywearing,35pgll,whambat,2,Tue May 12 16:56:09 2015 UTC,I'd stick with a standard Tula. Max weight on Std is 45lb.You could probably go for a standard Kinderpack (as opposed to infant) at this point too if you're interested in those. Std tend to be a little easier to come by than inf.

But to answer your question, start by releasing the waist band so it's super loose, as well as the shoulder straps.  Then, place it on your waist right around your belly button and adjust to fit. Snug is best. Put the baby in (remember the M position) and put on one shoulder strap, then the other. Then reach under your arms/armpits and grab the end of the left shoulder strap. Pull tight and fast to your cpmfort. Repeat on other side.   Good luck."

babywearing,35iswt,tealeaf_monster,5,Sun May 10 20:04:22 2015 UTC,You can get an infant insert for the Ergo. The ktan really isn't useful for a super long time. I'd just spend the money on an insert and skip the ktan.
babywearing,35iswt,sfak,1 point,Sun May 10 20:44:18 2015 UTC,thank you. definitly looking to get more for my money. seems there are better options than the k'tan breeze.
babywearing,35iswt,fading_fad,4,Sun May 10 22:19:44 2015 UTC,"I don't own either, but its my understanding that you will need the newborn insert to use the ergo from birth. I think that would be pretty warm. I googled the ktan and here are my thoughts. Its a sized carrier, which means that you can't switch between you and your partner (if you have one). Its a stretchy carrier, which means thst even though its rated to 35 pounds, i highly doubt it would be comfortable or supportive after 15 pounds. It looks pretty pricey for what it is and i think the resale value would be low. On the pro side, it looks great for heat and easy to use.  If spending the money isn't a problem for you, and you dont need something that both parents can use, i would buy it and then switch to the ergo in the fall. The baby should be big enough for you then.  Another option is a light and gauzy ring sling (maybe linen)? They are easy to use, you and your partner can both use it, and you can probably get one for $30.  Final note: i saw on the ktan website some pictures depicting what i would call unsafe babywearing, namely cradle hold, face out carries and back carries, which i think aren't safe for a stretchy wrap."

It's quick and super comfy for both. The ergo (or any ssc) will be great as they get older. We liked ours 3+ months. It felt more natural once she started supporting herself more."
babywearing,35iswt,LowOnHope,3,Mon May 11 20:37:41 2015 UTC,"I loved my k'tan when my baby was small. It was great up until 12 lbs or so when I switched to a Tula (similar to the ergo).  If you have the money for one, I say go for it!   The infant insert in the ergo will be VERY hot and sweaty. If you end up just using the ergo, I would look up how to roll a receiving blanket for support instead."
babywearing,35iswt,SugarandSass,2,Sun May 10 22:15:17 2015 UTC,yeah i just looked up pictures of the infant insert and it definitly looks HOT. 90+ degree weather will make the insert useless unfortunately.   glad to hear you liked your k'tan!
babywearing,35iswt,111288vib,3,Sun May 10 22:39:42 2015 UTC,I have both and I miss my K'Tan so much. Once my twins were 15lbs it was too uncomfortable to wear but I'm so happy I had it. It opened the door to baby wearing for me. I moved to the ergo around 4 months and it's been great. The ergo is now my husbands carrier and I have a Tula.  So happy I had both.
babywearing,35iswt,111288vib,2,Mon May 11 17:28:13 2015 UTC,"thanks! glad to hear you liked it a lot for the real early times. i think it looks like a great ""gateway"" carrier (lol). and glad to hear people liking the ergo a lot."

babywearing,35iswt,jlynnbizatch,2,Mon May 11 02:44:39 2015 UTC,I have a k'tan. I live in southern California it gets hot here as well. I didn't know about the k'tan breeze. My little guy never really liked the K'tan. I used it maybe handful of time until I ordered a ring sling. I love my ring sling. I just ordered a mesh ring sling for summer.

babywearing,35iswt,cantwait12,2,Tue May 12 16:45:06 2015 UTC,On Etsy.com I don't know if you've heard of it? People have there own businesses make and sale all kinds of things. I looked up mesh ring sling found a navy blue one. There are also linen ring slings. I have a linen ring sling at the moment. I love it even though it does get a little hot. My little dude is almost 2 months and he's a little heater. I hope the mesh brings in a little air/ventilation. Fingers crossed. Where I live we get Santa Ana winds.

babywearing,35iswt,mugsywebb,2,Tue May 12 18:48:16 2015 UTC,"I own both and if it's not too cost prohibitive, I would highly recommend the K'Tan Breeze with you living in Houston.  For a newborn, you really need to use the infant insert, which can turn into a little baby roasting oven in hot weather.  In addition, it is also a lot hotter for you the wearer.  I liked the K'Tan Breeze in warmer weather since it served the dual purpose of keeping both baby and ME cool in hot weather."
babywearing,35iswt,fuzzball__,2,Fri May 15 01:43:58 2015 UTC,I live in Phoenix. I have both a k'tan and ergo. My 11 week old is still to small for the ergo (he was born a month early) and the infant insert is hot as hell. I've been using the k'tan since we got home from the hospital and I love it. I bought mine off Amazon and it was only like $30 so if your gifted the ergo I would totally get the k'tan to use while your baby is still small. It's really user friendly too.

I'm currently borrowing the all seasons from my bw group and I'm loving the lumbar support.  Tula and KP definitely have the best prints but you're right, scoring one is difficult. If you're willing to spend a little extra there are quite a few buy/sell/trade groups on Facebook for Tulas and KP's. They almost always sell on there for more than retail but you can get one a little easier and there's tons of prints.  Beco's have some cute prints too.  :)"

My budget is around $180, so I'm probably not looking to buy anything over retail.  I was just browsing and found Connecta baby carriers. I love this one: http://www.connectababycarrier.com/shop/anchor-in-lifes-ocean-v-2-connecta/?attribute_strap-size=Standard%20Straps  but it seems like the waist belt/band is narrow and I don't want anything that will dig into me. :\  I was just checking out the Beco carriers and I like the neck support but none of their prints thrill me. My LO's middle name is Luna, so I wish I could find a moon themed carrier.  Thanks for your suggestions! I know I'm being hilariously picky but it's because this is a pretty large purchase for me. I envy the women who have multiple carriers."

babywearing,35d4ll,fathoms_up,5,Sat May 9 03:57:04 2015 UTC,"I personally am an ssc lover. I know people wrap up to toddler age, but I think that if your kiddo is 20lb already you're going to get more use out of the Tula carrier rather than  the wrap. Another option is a Kinderpack... They are very comfortable but almost impossible to get at retail and sort of expensive at market value. So if you go that route you'd probably want to sell both the Tula and the wrap."

babywearing,35d4ll,pigby411,3,Sat May 9 21:23:49 2015 UTC,It seems like you might prefer a buckle like the tula due to ease of use... I would be kind of careful using the k'tan as a sling on your hip when she's older/bigger though-- the stretchy fabric won't be as supportive and she may be able to flip herself out or sag uncomfortably.
babywearing,35d4ll,Sophie_6_Toes,1 point,Sat May 9 17:02:19 2015 UTC,Thank you :) I am realizing that I haven't used the k'tan for a few months now and while I was told when I bought it that it could be used for a while I remember the last time I tried it already being a little frustrated at how it stretched so much!
babywearing,35d4ll,Jennchilada,1 point,Sun May 10 03:58:30 2015 UTC,Maybe a half buckle carrier would be suitable for you. It's basically a mei tai but the waist band has padding and a buckle. The top straps are wrap fabric so very easy to adjust and suitable for multiple wearers.
babywearing,35d4ll,Jennchilada,1 point,Sat May 9 09:10:53 2015 UTC,"Unless you are saving it for future kiddos, the ktan won't be much use to you anymore. She's too heavy for it to be comfortable and she can more easily wiggle her way out of it. The mei tai will be a good backup carrier (like you mentioned) but the narrow straps will probably make it uncomfortable for you for long periods of time. As far as the full buckle and wrap go, it depends on what your goals are. The pros of the full buckle are that it is quick, easy to use, and easier to store when you are out and she's not in it. However, she will eventually grow out of it so you may need to size up in about a year if you want to keep on wearing her. The pros of the wrap are that it is versatile (can wrap in many different ways), and that she won't grow out of it. However, it takes a little more skill and time to put on so it's not great for quick ups and downs. It might also get a little diggy in the shoulders once she gets heavier, depending on the fiber and thickness of the wrap."

People have even carried 2 and 3 year olds safely in Ergos!  Also, almost all 'toddler' carriers (like toddler Tulas, Becos and Lenny Lamb ssc) on the market right now are probably going to be too big until your baby is at minimum 18 months, 25-28lb, and fitting into size 2T clothes. Toddler carriers should really be named 'preschool' carriers, because that's the size of kid they actually fit best!  Eta: that being said, if you want to get another carrier, go for it! It's just a good idles to try on first - many of them are much bigger than people think they are. :)"

They then proceeded to talk to me about how I have to marry my then-bf because God wants parents to be married and etc etc stuff I already knew. I mean, I ended up marrying him anyway, but they, in no way at all, affected my decision-making.  Honestly, I don't even think they're allowed to mention religion at all because... Well, the form they make women sign (I had to sign a few) states that they are NOT allowed to discuss religion or prayer or anything and every questionnaire at every appointment has the question if religion was discussed or if there was prayer during the meeting, and I've been specifically directed to say no because ""the state would cut it's funding""... I thought it was just my specific center that was like that, but if other centers do it, maybe there's more to it?  But hey, I think the program is good for what it is (learning about pregnancy and infants as well as helping low-income moms have a means to get things like baby clothes, cribs, nursing equipment, and baby ointments) and I can personally tolerate it, so I'm not gonna whistle-blow."

Overall, when it comes to these pregnancy crisis ministries, I appreciate services they provide, but they're dangerously naive and I have a big issue with the medical misinformation they spread.   At least in my area, there are secular organizations (like the health department) that have very similar programs without the religious propaganda."

I, on the other hand, am not as trusting of people in general, so as he's falling headfirst into everything they say, I'm trying to think for myself and question everything they say.

That part looks great from what I can see. You don't necessarily need their head cranked back.   The legs are tricky. They recommend legs out from birth now, so try doing it with the legs out of the wrap. That way, you can be certain that the weight is distributed on the bum, rather than on their tiny little ankles! If the knees are higher than the bum, it creates an ""M"" shape that is perfect for babe.   this is a pretty good video.   Looks absolutely great for a first try!!"

You can also try a carry called front wrap cross carry. Just ensure that all 3 passes are spread over baby at the end, as stretchy wraps require 3 layers for proper support. Wrapping Rachel makes some great videos.  Front wrap cross carry is a great starter carry, and is perfect for woven wraps if you decide to move on to wovens. :)"

Legs out is advised, but it baby insists on being balled up, the weight must be in baby's bum and not on its feet. If the baby can stand any little bit when in the carrier (meaning its actively pushing with its feet), it's time for legs out. http://dirtydiaperlaundry.com/babywearing-basics-from-bwi-educator-babywearing-faith/  Basically, baby must be seated on in its rear not putting pressure on its feet in anyway. Mine has been feet out since birth...she's not one to be balled up though :)   Here's an image of what that looks like: http://imgur.com/KZF68KL  (Edit: Your boba will have a final horizontal pass across the front and baby's back)"

If you plan on hand washing it only (who has time for that haha) then you could do it that way, but linen will break in/soften up nicely if you machine wash & dry it -glad to hear you got official Sling Rings, there are many knock offs out there. I am just getting into distributing them here in Canada as it is a pain to get any colour up here of ""official"" sling rings. There is at least one website I know of selling knock offs, plus tons of people on Etsy and amazon and eBay. -Was there a particular tutorial you were going to follow? If you ordered your rings from SlingRings.com you probably saw all their links on tutorials and shoulder styles. Even with my mediocre sewing ability I am able to pull off the ""pleated shoulder"" style as per the tutorials by Sleeping Baby Productions, Jan the owner/operator has a pretty wordy website with a few youtube videos which I found very helpful. Her website also lists all the typical shoulder styles in order of sewing difficulty. If you're not very confident at all, you could start with the Gathered Shoulder, which is the easiest. The Pleated is considered a little harder just because you're sewing through quite a few layers of fabric at one time. My entry-ish level model Singer machine handles the pleats alright though! If I could stop being such a noob and figure out how I would post pictures of the ones I've done in progress. I've mostly just used tablecloths I've purchased on amazon.ca for the slings I've made (search ""Mahogany 120"" jaquard"", my favourite is Tree of Life in grey/black). One Mahogany brand table cloth gets you two ring slings, and they break in very nicely. I have a linen wrap on the way from Natibaby in the next few weeks, so maybe I'll convert that myself.  A good place to start: http://www.sleepingbaby.net/jan/Baby/shoulders.html  Hope that helps! Good luck!"

babywearing,34gc45,bonjourtabby,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:53:45 2015 UTC,If you're willing to pay over retail there are buy/sell/trade groups for Kinderpacks on facebook.
babywearing,34gc45,bsueb,1 point,Fri May 1 03:47:51 2015 UTC,"The fb groups are serious crooks, thus the lack of ability to get one from the retailer. I tried today too. Some people caught on to the popularity of these carriers in the last year and I believe through automated bots these crooks are buying the $180 carriers and selling them on various resale sites for $400. The wahms who own the company are either in cahoots or don't care because this problem is not being resolved. Because you're looking for a new print you have 2 choices pay more or get one in the retail ring.  Super sucks that some leeches are ruining it for real people who really want to use them and the idiots who run the majority of the fb resale groups are all for the price gouging because they think they can sell their own for the same cost. Which they deem ""market value""  The reality of resale for kp owners is that if you have one you'll have it for a year or so and when it's time to sell the inflated resale will have moved on to another product and you'll be left with less than retail cost buyers. Which is totally acceptable. Just be prepared to find that the kp you pay for will in fact lose value."
babywearing,3479y3,dalikin,2,Tue Apr 28 21:29:25 2015 UTC,I like multi pass carries for squirmy kids. Rucks are great because they're quick and easy but they're too easy to get out of for determined kids. I love Elleville Jordan's back carry.
babywearing,3479y3,iliketoasttoo,2,Tue Apr 28 23:11:03 2015 UTC,Try a secure back carry instead
babywearing,3479y3,beanbaconsoup,2,Wed Apr 29 11:12:00 2015 UTC,"I need help with this too. I can't lean forward to wrap her because she's immediately on hands and knees no matter what position I'm in! The suggestions for different carries would be nice if baby was escaping after being wrapped, but this is mid-wrap every time for us, so we can't get a secure wrap. I've honestly just switched to mostly SSC and I use the wrap in the house when I can be a little sloppier with it or have help holding her down."
babywearing,3479y3,SugarandSass,3,Wed Apr 29 11:43:26 2015 UTC,"I've just swapped to hip carries for now and trying to keep her little hands out of things is a mission. Luckily she is okay being put on her playmat while I cook dinner, but still! I like having her with me :)"

babywearing,3479y3,taytertot29,2,Wed Apr 29 19:11:23 2015 UTC,Stand up a little straighter while you're wrapping. Sometimes when they feel less stable they don't wiggle as much and kinda hook on like a baby backpack

I already have an intense collection of wraps and carriers just waiting!"
babywearing,340jq2,Illusiveness,3,Mon Apr 27 10:09:33 2015 UTC,"I tend to see three groups of baby wearers.   Those who are interested and just buy the most affordable option, this is the market that buys Bjorn carriers.  Those who do a little bit of research and get an ergonomic and hip healthy carrier, like Ergo/Tula/LilleBaby. Ergo is generally the most affordable of the ergonomic carriers and easier to find second hand.  Those who know about wrapping through a close friend/family member or spent a lot of time looking for the most universal/cost efficient option.    I live in the Pacific Northwest. I see a lot of Ergo Sport/Original with the super active parents. Wraps are incredibly popular here with everyone else. ""Hippie culture"" is very alive in my city. Even the local babywearing group is 99% wraps.  In Seattle I saw less carriers, and most of the ones I noticed were Ergo styles. This is most likely a result of which neighborhoods I was in."
babywearing,340jq2,WA_mama2,2,Mon Apr 27 19:02:02 2015 UTC,"How is the culture between baby wearers over there? Is there a lot of talk between babywearing parents? There are a lot of facebook groups here where you would nearly be criticised to death for saying you wear using a Bjorn.  What's the popular wrap brand being used over there?  The european babywearing conference just announced that Bjorn was a sponsor, a lot of consultants replied in dismay due to the fact they are not ergonomical. The opinion of some including myself is that even though they are not ergonomical they do get people carrying, and whilst we'd prefer they'd be carrying ergonomical, better to carry with them then carry without them. I tend to see a Baby Bjorn a gateway to ergonomical carrying, a lot of mothers start off with a Bjorn and then complain about the weight distribution and start looking for something else.  I've never heard of Lillebaby before, I just googled to see their product and saw some reviews comparing it to the ergobaby 360, do you have any experience with the Lillebaby?"
babywearing,340jq2,spaceheater,2,Mon Apr 27 19:45:41 2015 UTC,"Many people I've talked to used the Bjorn, realized how uncomfortable it was, and quit wearing altogether because they thought that's what all babywearing felt like.

babywearing,341402,babywtfbbq,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:01:53 2015 UTC,"I have an Ergo360 and I love it. It feels really secure and comfortable. It's a good choice for long wear or when you will be walking a lot. My husband has even used it to grocery shop alone a few times. It meant to carry them for a long time, even when they are out of toddlerhood. The only downside is that it isn't easy to pop the baby in and out. There's a fair amount of snapping and adjusting that must be done. For a quick and easy carrier (at work or when I'm getting a few things done around the house) I use a Balboa Baby sling."

The only thing about ergo360 is that I don´t understand the face forward possibility, because that is definately not recommended. I´ve heard you can use it for about two years. Boba is also fine btw. personely I´m not a big fan of ringslings, but they´re all fine and ergonomic. If you want more options you could always look for a wrap. I´m a big wrap fan :D"

babywearing,33sndg,mellontree,2,Sat Apr 25 07:51:52 2015 UTC,We have one in a neighboring town. I'm going to try and get her appointment there.
babywearing,33sndg,Sinafey,2,Sat Apr 25 09:56:31 2015 UTC,"For a front carry in either of your buckle carriers I'd recommend having her try buckling the waist belt and putting her bad arm through it's shoulder strap. Then, while sitting (at least while she's figuring it all out) have her load baby into the carrier, paying special attention that he's centered on the panel. Then she can carefully reach her good arm through it's shoulder strap and tighten as necessary. She'll probably need someone to help her snug up the strap on her bad arm and possibly the chest belt, so if there's any possibility of her having her own carrier, where nobody else makes adjustments to the straps, that would be ideal."

As my LO got bigger, that made a HUGE difference in the comfort of my SSC (kinderpack), so definitely worth a shot if Ergo lets you do that.   Also, depending where your back discomfort is / what kind, might just mean you could use some strap adjusting to place the strain elsewhere on your back, so maybe try adjusting some things if you haven't already?

I was huge, and being able to wear my almost 2 year old was an absolute lifesaver. I used a Kozy mei tai, which I adore. I definitely recommend a mei tai for pregnant wearing.  Front carries were pretty much impossible after the first few months, but seriously, back carries saved my life.  Plus, when the new one comes, then you get to do this!"

I resisted going to a meeting for so long and when I finally did it was like going home.  I'm an introvert usually but it was so easy to jump in and learn from those people.

I guess sitting would be fine, but actually carrying like that kinda compresses baby and allows their chins to tuck in which could block their airway. We've nursed like this from about four weeks (she started getting much better at latching and a more efficent feeder). The sling is supposed to be up higher to carry (within kissing distance of baby's head), but you just let the rings loosen and shrug them down to boob height. If you have bigger boobs, you might could lift them up to baby, but I have to get baby to mine :)"

babywearing,32caa8,disneyworldplz,2,Sun Apr 12 15:53:17 2015 UTC,"My favorite are the woven wraps. I haven't tried a lot of other carriers but of the ones I have I find wovens to be the most comfortable and diverse. If you get a larger wrap, say a size 6 or 7, it will fit a lot of different body types. There is a learning curve to them but once you get the hang of the carries it is really easy. For fabric you're going to want to go with cotton or linen. Linen is the most breathable with cotton being the second. I just got a linen/cotton blend from Wrapsody and it feels very comfortable on some hot days we've had already. I hope this has helped!"
babywearing,32caa8,punchyourfacein,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:35:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! Other than wrapsody are there any other brands you'd recommend?
babywearing,32caa8,dalikin,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:47:57 2015 UTC,"Of the Wrapsody ones, I would get the Wrapsody breeze, not the Stretch-Hybrid. Stretchy wraps are good for little babies but can be very hot (the Stretch-Hybrid is cotton jersey so will be very warm for summer), and we found anyway that our stretchy wrap (a Moby) was not supportive enough once our LO was about 4 months. A woven wrap (as opposed to a stretchy) can be used up until toddler age.  I personally love our Oscha linen/cotton blend, as linen is very breathable and good for summer. Oscha wraps are high-end though so are quite expensive. Any cotton/linen blend wrap would be nice and cool for summer.  Here's a link to Oscha linen: http://www.oschaslings.com/shop/product/baby-wraps/0/0/0/linen/0/1/12/5  And Diva Milano (also expensive but good): http://www.diva-milano.com/linen/  Or there's Ellevill which are beautiful too: http://www.ellevill.com/en/categories/woven-wraps-linencotton-blend  Personally I like this one of Ellevill: http://www.ellevill.com/en/products/linen-zara-bluez - 800NOK is about $100USD so they aren't too much more expensive than the Wrapsody.  I agree with the size 6 or 7 wrap being able to be worn by both of you - if you get a size 7 you will have quite long 'tails' that you may need to wrap around your waist several times before you tie off. But your husband will be able to wear it :)  Another thing to look at is the 'weight' of the wrap. It's called gsm (grams per square meter). Here's a good guide for wrap thickness: http://wovenwrapsdatabase.com/weight.php  Personally for summer I would go for a thin to medium wrap. Heavy wraps can be more supportive for toddlers but may be more difficult to learn: imagine tying a knot in a piece of string.. and then imagine tying a knot in a thick piece of rope you found on the docks :P The thick piece is a lot harder to tie a knot in. It's the same with woven wraps. Medium would be a good weight to start with, but don't worry TOO much about the weight because woven wraps have a learning curve regardless, and you will get there!  Hope this is helpful! If you google ""woven wrap guides"" online you can find lots of blogs with other helpful information."

babywearing,32caa8,dalikin,1 point,Sun Apr 12 20:26:36 2015 UTC,No worries! Do you have any other questions?

babywearing,32caa8,punchyourfacein,2,Sun Apr 12 20:33:44 2015 UTC,"Another comment is that with a size 6 or 7 it can be an overwhelming amount of fabric at first. It's seriously a huge, long, piece of fabric. But just try to take it slow when you are wrapping, remain calm, and if you have lots of fabric left over when you've completed the wrap, just wrap it around your waist multiple times so you can get it out of the way. Then once you are more experienced you can learn fancier 'finishes' which are basically ways to wrap the ends of the tails in cool patterns that look super pro and pretty :)"
babywearing,32caa8,Zoraptera,2,Sun Apr 12 20:41:27 2015 UTC,"Oh! Haha it is scary at the beginning. At first you should only learn front carries - the best one to learn first is called the Front Wrap Cross Carry (FWCC). Then once you've got that sorted, look up some other front carries to play with. THEN, learn some hip carries! The Robbins Hip Carry and the Poppins Hip Carry are pretty cute.   Finally, once your baby is at least 6 months old, and you've been wrapping regularly for a few months (3 months minimum), try some back carries. Back carries should only be done if your baby is 6 months + if you are an inexperienced wrapper because you need to make sure the baby's airway is clear (and this can only be done if the baby can hold their head up/sit independently, and you can get them high enough on your back to be able to see them if you turn your head). When you do finally learn back carries, learn them standing next to your bed so that if you fuck it up you can lean backwards/crouch and gently put your baby on the bed. I also used my husband as a spotter so I didn't accidentally flip my baby forwards over my shoulders haha.  Definitely watch a few videos of FWCC with a newborn and you'll be able to see how the baby doesn't fall out :D  In terms of safety once the baby is actually wrapped onto your body, the main things to remember are the TICKS guidelines."
babywearing,32caa8,punchyourfacein,1 point,Sun Apr 12 20:38:49 2015 UTC,The wrap will probably come with some information or a dvd about how to do carries. There are a ton of YouTube videos too.

babywearing,325l4w,MustacheBus,2,Fri Apr 10 22:27:58 2015 UTC,I just received my first Tula last week (standard rockets) and also ordered suck pads. I ordered mine from imagiNANA on Etsy. Honestly I ordered from her cause she had matching fabric and the conversion rate wasn't going to break the bank. They are quite well made and I'm very pleased with my order.
babywearing,31xys5,keeksg,5,Thu Apr 9 00:57:15 2015 UTC,I'm not familiar with amazonas but you can never go wrong with a didy! The company has been around forever making wraps and they are very well known.

For Amazonian baby wearing is not prime business. They are cheap and kinda popular over here, but they are not as comfortable as Didymos or girasols - thin ones are diggy on shoulders (ok Didymos diamond weaves also have this issue, but less so), thick ones are rough and do not soften with use like good wraps do.  If price is not an issue you will likely be happier with Didymos."

babywearing,31gtvi,Qwilla,10,Sat Apr 4 23:16:43 2015 UTC,"For the newborn stage AND Quick ups for toddlers/bigger babies I HIGHLY recommend getting a cotton or linen ringsling.    your husband can use it as well, there is a bit of a learning curve but they're fairly easy. Watch TONS of youtube videos or see if there's a local meetup before you have your baby. Typically babywearing mamas are pretty helpful!  Good luck and enjoy!"
babywearing,31gtvi,debosaurus,5,Sat Apr 4 23:41:25 2015 UTC,"Ring slings are my favourite for nursing in. They're super adjustable and versatile. They're available in a variety of fabrics, so you might be able to find a lightweight one for hot weather. I have just put a cotton receiving blanket between me and baby to create a sort of sweat barrier in hot weather. But after pregnancy, babywearing doesn't seem so sweaty. Plus, a mother's chest helps to regulate the baby's body temperature.   Probably my second favourite is a soft structured carrier (such as a bEco or an Ergo). Most women can still nurse in them and they seem to be favoured by dads."
babywearing,31gtvi,neluuna,2,Sat Apr 4 23:42:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for tip! Where is the best place to purchase a ring sling? I see them on etsy and have heard of Maya ring slings... is there a difference in quality or a way I can tell if a ring sling is ""good"" or not?"

babywearing,31gtvi,dalikin,4,Sun Apr 5 01:56:36 2015 UTC,"It kind of gets hot with any carrier haha, but I agree about a ring sling.  It was a little hard to learn at first with my newborn but now it's my go-to and she's a year old.  Watch some videos about how to do a tummy to tummy with a newborn out go to a local babywearing group - they're super helpful!   I did buy one of those sports towels to keep you cool that you can put between you and the baby but only tried it once or twice in the summer, but that could help possibly.   My husband doesn't like the ring sling so I got him a soft structured carrier and he likes using it and I'll use it too, depending on the day and what we're doing.     I breastfed (still am!) but never really got good at nursing in the carrier but found that the ring sling was easier to adjust for this.   But, like I said, I didn't try to much with the SSC (soft structured) or wraps.   There are so many options for carriers and it's kind of insane really once you stay getting into it.  I got a Maya ring sling as a gift and that was good to start and my friend lent me her Moby Wrap stretchy wrap which was a bit hard to get at first but really great when the baby is little.  The Moby is nice for saving one shoulder from getting tired like with the ring sling.  It's pretty cheap too,  but not recommended for babies over 15 pounds.  Ergo is a really popular and easy brand to find for soft structured and you can find it on sale a lot.  We got a Boba, which I really like, but I'm jonesing for a Tula.  There are some other really good SSC brands, too.   If you go with a soft structured,  they sell inserts for newborns until they reach a certain weight/size.  Search for videos on how to make a newborn seat out of a receiving blanket instead and save yourself some money.   The Boba does come with a little insert, though.   Oh and if you start looking into different carriers,  there are a ton of weird acronyms so be prepared!   There's a Facebook group called Babywearing102 and another called Everyday Babywearing which have some helpful resources and people who can help share ideas, too!  Hope that helps!"
babywearing,31gtvi,dalikin,2,Sun Apr 5 00:03:35 2015 UTC,I've actually just recently joined a local babywearing group on facebook! They seem really nice and I'm excited to go to their next meeting to ask some questions and get to know people! They have a lending library that I'm excited to try once my babe gets here. I just want something cool and easy to use before she gets here so I've got something to wear her in for the first few days/weeks. Thanks so much!
babywearing,31gtvi,dalikin,5,Sun Apr 5 01:13:13 2015 UTC,"Personally I would go for a linen ring sling. Cotton can be hot but linen is very breathable. Watch lots of video tutorials before bub arrives and practice the ring sling with a teddy bear, it can be trickier than it looks!"
babywearing,31gtvi,dalikin,1 point,Sun Apr 5 00:49:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! Is there a place you recommend for purchasing a good quality linen ring sling?
babywearing,31gtvi,readitlearnitliveit,2,Sun Apr 5 01:13:56 2015 UTC,"Check out these Oscha Ring Slings (linen or linen blend). - http://www.oschaslings.com/shop/product/ring-slings/0/0/0/linen/0/1/12/5  If you have the choice, choose gathered rather than pleated shoulder, it's easier to adjust and spread (I find)."
babywearing,31gtvi,debosaurus,1 point,Sun Apr 5 01:34:39 2015 UTC,"No problem. How much are you looking to spend? Little Frog make good, cheap ring slings, though they are cotton rather than linen. I love ours. Cotton is much easier to break in than linen (i.e. linen takes quite a few wears, washes in the laundry, etc before it's soft), but cotton has the problem of being a bit hot so it's a tradeoff.  If you're willing to spend a bit more, Oscha have beautiful ring slings and are well known for their high quality Irish linen. Didymos also make nice ring slings but it might (again) be tricky to find a linen one.  We have an Oscha wrap (cotton/linen blend), a Little Frog ring sling (cotton), an Ergo, and a Woven Wings wrap (cotton). They are all wonderful in their own way, but the linen is definitely the coolest. The Ergo is good but when baby is a newborn you have to use the infant insert which is like a cushion and it can be really hot.  What you can do is join this FB group: - https://www.facebook.com/groups/bwbss/?fref=ts It's Australian based but anyone can join, and just search ""ring sling"" or ""RS"" in the search for that group, and browse through the things that come up. As much as it can be good to get a cheap sling, or one that meets your criteria e.g. linen, the MOST important things are that a) it's SAFE, and b) you LOVE the pattern. If you don't love how it looks, you won't wear it very much. I'd much rather wear a hot ring sling that I love than a nice breezy one that I hate the look of. Ring slings are just wonderful but it can take a little bit of time to learn how to use them so that they are comfortable, and if you think it's ugly you won't put in the effort!"
babywearing,31gtvi,brahmma,1 point,Sun Apr 5 01:33:41 2015 UTC,"I'd say around $60ish, but I'd be willing to spend more for something I really loved. I think I'm probably going to end up with an Ergo later on, but you're right the infant insert is really hot! The only experience with baby wearing I have is when I was a nanny for my close friend a few years back. Her son was very small when I watched him and someone had given her an Ergo at her shower - it was so convenient and I loved carrying him in it but the heat was ungodly! It was much better once he was old/big enough to be in it sans the infant insert!  Your advice on picking a ring sling is very good! You're right... I won't wear it unless I absolutely love it. I've been looking at Maya wraps and now the Oscha ones (thanks for the suggestion!) and I'll likely pick one from there. Thank you again!"

I would highly recommend Pognae to anyone considering a SSC. They have cute designs (maybe not quite the same as Tula), and they are way more affordable. Oh, and bonus - they are made in the US, so they are sure to comply with the babywearing safety standards. (Not that Ergos and Tulas don't as well).  http://www.pognaeusa.com/collections/pognae-baby-carriers"
babywearing,318y8p,endlessunshine,2,Fri Apr 3 00:04:05 2015 UTC,I just got a Pognae a few weeks ago! I was hesitant because it isn't a brand I had ever heard about before. But I love it! Especially the part that can be unzipped and rolled down to allow for air flow.

babywearing,318y8p,endlessunshine,3,Fri Apr 10 14:37:01 2015 UTC,"There's more padding around a Tula. I (and many many other people I know) agree that Tula's are more comfy to wear. I've owned both and while I do think they're more comfy than the ergo, it's not by much. I really love them both.   If it's the prints that you're into then though that's different :)   Even though Tula's right now are madness. People buying and selling them at an enormous mark up. People are doing it to just make money (on the bst Tula groups on FB). So hopefully you had your eye on a print that Tula regularly keeps stocked!"
babywearing,318y8p,Axora,3,Fri Apr 3 00:25:19 2015 UTC,"I have one of each.  I find the Ergo much more comfortable, whereas my wife prefers the Tula. I actuall like the bulkiness of the Ergo, to me if feels more secure and easier to get on/off. I also like the plain look, feels more manly than our Tula (Prepster pattern). A few guys I've talked to say they prefer the ergo but most women prefer the Tula. So I suspect Ergos may be better suited to a male's body shape.  My wife likes then extra padding on the shoulders of the Ergo too, but I don't really notice that much of a difference.  They're both pretty similar carriers, so I wouldnt expect to go to a Tula and think it will be a huge difference, but it may suit your body better, which could mean more comfort over extended periods of time, plus if you like the look of the Tula better you'll probably be inclined to wear it more often.  Good luck with the decision."
babywearing,318y8p,skaschmidt,3,Fri Apr 3 01:11:11 2015 UTC,"It's not so much ""Which is more comfortable?"" and it's more ""Which is more comfortable for YOU?"". Different carriers suit different body types, so you need to just try them on if you can before you buy them. There should hopefully be a babywearing meetup or sling/carrier library in your area where you can try things out!"
babywearing,318y8p,dalikin,2,Fri Apr 3 03:31:48 2015 UTC,I tried the ergo and hated it.  I moved over to a tula toddler and LOVE it.  BUT....my first toddler kinderpack is arriving tomorrow so we'll see.  I think the ergo is less bulky but i can't stand the fit.  I found the tula to have way more shoulder padding and it was more adjustable.  The kinderpack is supposed to be even more adjustable and some come with koolknit to make it cooler for summer use.  It is MUCH harder to get a kinderpack right now.  And tulas you're best bet to save money is to get one at retail from an online retailer because the aftermarker is sky high right now!
babywearing,318y8p,evilkittylover12,2,Tue Apr 21 18:47:01 2015 UTC,"No input either way, but Tula and a few other brands have special toddler sizes that might be worth a look into if you have a bigger toddler.

And even then, only for very short periods of time.   In my experience, nothing is going to help when you're perpendicular to the ground. Instead, try squatting down and not bending over."
babywearing,315idf,mrs_wac,1 point,Thu Apr 2 08:56:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply! I've never tried wearing my newborn on my back but I have worn my toddler several times. I have seen lots of baby wearing moms wearing newborns on their backs so I thought it was possible, definitely with some practice, and probably not for long, but after your warning I'll steer clear until she's at least 3 or 4 months old."
babywearing,315idf,mrs_wac,1 point,Thu Apr 2 12:28:12 2015 UTC,Recommended age is 6+ months and sitting well without support. Baby needs to be able to control their trunk enough to maintain a good airflow.

babywearing,315idf,blue_ash,1 point,Thu Apr 2 12:13:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the warning re: back carry! I'm pretty comfortable with my wovens but just haven't used a lot of different carries other than fwcc for newborns. I've been using it mostly for the toddler.  I will try tucking her head into a cross pass. I usually have them bunched to the sides because we both overheat quickly, and I use a rolled up washcloth in the top of the centre panel for head support, so I didn't even think of opening up a rail. I've tried that in the stretchy wrap but that wrap is so tight, she didn't like having her head confined unless she was asleep. Maybe with the woven it will be less head-squishing."

babywearing,312ck3,punchyourfacein,1 point,Wed Apr 1 16:12:24 2015 UTC,How big is baby?  I linen blend ring sling is nice for summer.  Woven wraps can be hot depending on the carry..  the front one with 3 layers can be hot.  You can try other carries with only one layer over baby.

babywearing,30yun4,Meilikah,3,Tue Mar 31 20:30:12 2015 UTC,"I don't have first hand experience with LL, but I've heard nothing but good things about Lenny Lamb wraps. The ""regular"" wrap is a simple weave, where the diamond weave has a bit more texture, and would be a bit more grippy.   100% cotton is a good way to go for a beginner wrapper. It's easy to work with, and a bit forgiving of a sloppy wrap job.  Bamboo wraps are perfect for a new baby, as they are suuuper soft. Bamboo wraps tend to be a bit slippy though, from what I've heard.   Make sure you check the outlet section on their site! The wraps there have some small defect like a pulled thread or a weavers knot. These do not affect the safety of the wrap at all, so if you're okay with a few small cosmetic flaws you can save a bit of money."

babywearing,30vyps,aimeenew,4,Tue Mar 31 03:35:12 2015 UTC,That's sad to hear just because I love mine so much.  I'd guess you are right about it being too big.  If you wash it it'll shrink back down to original size (if it's at all stretched out).
babywearing,30vyps,MommaK4CJ,2,Tue Mar 31 17:57:27 2015 UTC,"I also hate my k'tan. I made sure I ordered the correct size and according to the sizing chart I needed an XS. That's what I got. It feels to tight. Could be because I'm breastfeeding and my chest size is a bit bigger than before. Not only that but when wearing it with baby it gets hot. I live in sunny California so that may be why. Anyhow, I just ordered a ring sling. I hope that works out. Fingers crossed"
babywearing,30vyps,111288vib,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:06:55 2015 UTC,Is it maybe too big? I had one that was suuuuper snug and gave it away because my kids hate being that close to me (they do well in soft structured carriers). Have you thought about maybe trading it with someone who needs a bigger size?

babywearing,30vyps,cantwait12,1 point,Tue Mar 31 08:57:18 2015 UTC,"According to their sizing, I should be wearing an XS. I bought a second hand size S from another mom for $20, and LO was snug and comfy in it. Now that he's over 15lb (at just 3 months) he's starting to droop and sag in it. This might be because I have the wrong size, but I'm starting to investigate ring slings and wraps as long-term alternatives."

babywearing,30p60v,donnamatrix79,2,Sun Mar 29 15:10:27 2015 UTC,"This was my first thought, too. I'd often take her out of the house in it which would give her more to look at and helped get us over that hump."

At 3 months I switched my daughter from the newborn hold to the regular hold in our wrap, and it did take some time to adjust!  Front carry has its weight limits, I never did that with my daughter (our carrier didn't do it, and I think babies look....uncomfortable) front, hip, and back still work for us at 18 months."

babywearing,30p60v,not-a-cylon,1 point,Sun Mar 29 18:41:30 2015 UTC,"Try the Robbins hip carry with your wrap, it ends up being essentially the same as a ring sling. I find it fine for getting stuff done around the house :)"
babywearing,30p60v,mugsywebb,2,Fri Apr 3 03:33:48 2015 UTC,"It may be a phase. My daughter refused to be worn except for facing outwards between three and five months. Then as she gained strength and could look around better, she was okay with facing in again.  You have some options. The first is, if your kid has enough strength for it, to try a hip carry. There are many carriers that allow for this. Ring slings, woven wraps, and some soft structured carriers can accommodate this.   There are also some carriers that allow front facing outwards (FFO). I recommend staying away from narrow-based carriers, because they will kill your back and there are more comfortable options than them. The Ergo 360 is the most ergonomic option and allows for the most optimal hip placement for the baby. The Beco Gemini and Lillebaby are pretty good too. There may be some others, but these are the ones I am personally familiar with.  Next, you could simply try to wait it out and try again later. I would bet this is just a phase. Plus when your baby is approximately 6 months old (when he is sitting well), you can do back carries and that should help too."
babywearing,30nu4l,Menelly,7,Sun Mar 29 02:08:39 2015 UTC,"Stretchy wraps are not safe with fewer than 3 passes and front carry only, if baby arches back that stretch is enough to spill out. However you could definitely sell it to a mama and buy some gauze, linen, or osnaburg and make a beautiful ring sling!!!"
babywearing,30nu4l,rc1965,2,Sun Mar 29 04:43:47 2015 UTC,"The wrapsody hybrid IS safe for back carries, which is why I'm trying to figure out if it's safe for a RS.  It's edge to edge stretch only.  Someone told me it might not be too comfy cause it may sag more, though.  I dunno."
babywearing,30nu4l,annielane,2,Sun Mar 29 14:52:10 2015 UTC,"That wrap is safe for back carries so I would assume is safe for a ring sling. I have a tencel ring sling that has more stretch than my wrapsody and its great for a little baby, its not comfortable for my toddler though."

babywearing,30nu4l,cranappley,1 point,Sun Mar 29 14:53:06 2015 UTC,"A tiny bit of stretch might be okay, but I personally wouldn't. I just really like how woven material feels in a ring sling. I don't think I'd feel secure."

babywearing,30k9l8,rocket_bag,2,Sat Mar 28 11:14:50 2015 UTC,Same here. I have a ring sling from Tula that has the tencel fabric and I love it.
babywearing,30k9l8,Axora,2,Sat Mar 28 19:43:01 2015 UTC,"Tencel makes a very floppy wrap when compared to a cotton one. You can do any carry with Tencel that you can do with any other fabric. The weight will depend on what size thread the weaver used, the ends per inch and the picks per inch they wove it at."
babywearing,30k9l8,SouthMountainMods,1 point,Sat Mar 28 12:31:15 2015 UTC,"I have some tencel jeans (not a wrap, I know) and they're much softer than my normal jeans. They seem to be just as strong and have held up well so far. I imagine a wrap would be the same."

I haven't tried a multilayer carry yet because it's a 3 and I'm mostly saving it for my squish later this year. I have so much to play with at the moment and need to find more  babies to wrap in the mean time. I think it's going to be a great newborn wrap for sure though."

Kinderpacks are also a great option with incredibly high weight limits like the tula's, but they can be difficult to get .They also have an option with ""kool knit"" which is a mesh panel right down the middle to help make it more breathable."

I'm not sure what weight limits are on other carriers, but you could try ergo 360 for forward facing) or one of the other kinds has more mesh, I think.

babywearing,30hefe,Sunna3,3,Fri Mar 27 20:21:26 2015 UTC,"An ergo is similar and fairly low cost.  Woven wraps are another option, though more work.    If you can spend the money, I'd get a Tula though.    Edit: I included the wrap as an option because of the versatility between wearers.  Sometimes a ssc can be difficult to get fitting larger people."
babywearing,30hefe,GoiterGlitter,1 point,Fri Mar 27 20:57:02 2015 UTC,Depends on how big the person actually is. Ergo sells a waist extender and can work for some tall bodies.

I’ve seen a bunch of people wearing carriers (Tulas and Ergos, etc) that add extra padding to the straps (like your Elmo ones). Is this just for looks, or does it serve an added purpose of protecting your shoulders? I only ask because sometimes it seems as if the padding is only in the front, not even over the shoulders, so I’m a little confused!"

babywearing,2zw9yj,HornOfDagoth,3,Mon Mar 23 01:35:49 2015 UTC,I've been eying the Mei tais.  My husband got the ergo 360 buts he's a size 34.  That thing would NEVER fit around me.  I'm hoping a custom Mei tai would.
babywearing,2zw9yj,Kacers,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:39:27 2015 UTC,they would!  you can make one too!  i did for my hubby who is larger then i am.

babywearing,2zw9yj,cassiland,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:14:19 2015 UTC,That makes me feel really good actually.  I LOVE the look of the Mei Tai and it looks to be really comfortable.
babywearing,2zw9yj,Kacers,3,Wed Mar 25 20:25:08 2015 UTC,"I am a size 18 and 5'9"" for reference with a DD chest. I have a babywearing obsession. I can pull off most carriers I have tried. I get a great bit with woven wraps. Size 7 is a good base size for me for front wrap cross carry, but I have used as short as a 3 also for some carries. I also have a few mei tais I like though if the straps are shorter I tie under butt instead of behind my back. Lastly for SSCs I love my tula. I also have a connecta solarweave SSC that fits well. The only carrier I haven't liked is a ring sling, but that's more because my son pops the seat. Nothing to do with my size."
babywearing,2zw9yj,Cheza_Salem,3,Mon Mar 23 01:08:19 2015 UTC,"I love, love my Tula. I have an ergo too and needed the extender belt for it to fit. With the tula I don't and have room to spare. It's super comfortable and easy to use. It does get very hot, especially in the summer in Florida, but I use those cooling towels on us and it helps. Summertime in Florida I'm almost always gross and sweaty anyway. I also have a water ring sling that I made that fits nicely."

They come in different sizes to accommodate different body shapes easily. Ring slings are a great option too. I personally like mei tais a lot...and they are great if you are switching between people of different sizes (so it's been really nice for myself and my husband to switch off using).  As far as SSC's go, Tulas are good and Kinderpacks are good. Before we got our Tulas, my plus-sized husband used a Beco Gemini with no issues. Apparently Ergo stopped making the waist extender, so I can't really recommend them. I don't know how other SSC's are with plus-sized folks since I don't have experience with them and neither do my friends.   Honestly there are a ton of options out there and I don't think you'll be too size-restricted. :)"

The baby Bjorn was my gateway carrier and I found it incredibly uncomfortable as well. A woven wrap tied correctly will offer you support through your back and shoulders.   For the newborn squish phase you could try a moby to see if you even like wrapping. I did find that as my son got older the moby, because it is so stretchy, didn't support as well and it would hurt my back."
babywearing,2zwa6l,msuaussiemom,1 point,Sun Mar 22 12:06:10 2015 UTC,Thanks!! Maybe the best solution is just trying a bunch of different wraps! I can honestly only see myself using it until about 6mo unless I really love it!  Do you have any experience with the seven slings free wraps you can order? Haha it sounds like it wouldn't be great since it's free just pay shipping but might be okay since I am really looking at 0-6mo for the meantime!  http://m.sevenslings.com
babywearing,2zwa6l,teachthetwerps,6,Sun Mar 22 12:21:46 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, seven slings are pretty useless. They are incredibly uncomfortable and just never fit right.

babywearing,2zwa6l,Axora,1 point,Sun Mar 22 12:40:42 2015 UTC,"Seven slings are really difficult to size and use comfortably. They're great to have in your diaper bag as a back up carrier but not for much more.   I've heard you should size up from what they recommend but I can't verify that.   We're 15 months in and still babywearing, I would search for something that can be comfortable for the long haul."

babywearing,2zvgy5,psychotic_napkin,2,Sun Mar 22 03:53:32 2015 UTC,"I ""made"" a woven wrap by buying some unbleached cotton. I was looking for osnaburg initially, as recommended on a website, but I found it so heavy. There were a few different thicknesses of the same type of unbleached woven cotton and I just got one that was a little lighter than the osnaburg.   I overshot and got 5 metres and when I got it home and practiced with it, I just trimmed the length and width of it until it felt right. It'd probably be safer and more secure to add seams, but I do a secure high back carry, so it's reinforced anyway.   It's not fancy and I doubt I'd be able to resell it, but it works and it cost me, like $15. It's my summer carrier."

Osnaburg is thin and it will dig into your shoulders and possibly your kids legs.   Do you have a Babywearing group nearby? Ours rents carriers on a two week basis so that may be an option. Also, carriers like a Tula or a woven wrap hold their value and you should be able to resell for what you paid."

I would only use the fabric paint where they can't get to it.   Dharma dyes are supposed to be top notch.

babywearing,2zdgu9,rizzlerazz,2,Wed Mar 18 00:15:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think no. They aren't worth the artificially inflated market value if you can't get one at retail. Lillebabies also have two mesh options are are just as good, if not better for you. Every BWI lending library should have both of them if you live near one. Lillebaby all seasons and air flow. I'd definitely try to try a bunch of different SSCs out before you commit to paying $200+ for one."

I'd like to be able to start carrying my little guy before then.   I'm usually into natural fibers in hot weather, so I love that Kinderpack is made primarily of cotton with just the synthetic mesh panel. The combination is nice.

I lucked out and got one at   retail in a stocking back last June (and was terrified of that price) but I would honestly pay some of the lower inflated prices I love it that much.   If you have some time go on the chatter and bst Facebook page and put in your iso. The ladies there are really nice.   And if you don't like it you can easily sell it.   Edit:and those inflated prices really are crazy. No lie. I love them but had to really convince myself to pay the 200. I want more but I think I'm going to just get a cover made.   Oh! And give it some time if you don't get one at stocking. The craze will die down and they will be cheaper resale again. It's just bc everyone had tax money right now.  I've watched it fluctuate from high 500s like now to 170s and retail a few times in the past year

It was ok for tiny babies and such but after my kid was over 10kg it really lacked in the waist imo. The belt webbing was pretty flimsy compared to the other two SSCs I have (Beco BB2 &Boba 4G), and no waist padding. No hard bit around the waist either. Perhaps the design or materials have improved in the past 4ish years, but just fyi that's my informal review. A mei tai or buckle tai would be much the same."

babywearing,2z54rs,itsincrediblytypical,1 point,Sun Mar 15 21:46:31 2015 UTC,I don't know if it's necessarily that the baby might sleep too much during the day but more that they don't eat enough during the day. My pediatrician said newborns will really only wake to eat or if a messy diaper bothers them. She told me if I want my 6-week-old to sleep through the night then I should feed him as much as possible during the day.   I feed him almost constantly during the day and his last feeding happens at 11pm. He usually doesn't wake up until 5:30 or 6:00 to eat again. Sometimes he will wake at 4:00 but that's not typical. In the case of my kid the more I feed him during the day the less he wakes at night - regardless of sleep amount during the day.   That said...all kids are different. So daytime sleep could of course rob nighttime sleep.
babywearing,2z54rs,incognito_mama,1 point,Sun Mar 15 18:09:00 2015 UTC,"My newborn (6 weeks) always sleeps a little extra in a carrier, i think it is just that he falls asleep more easily, still sleeps great at night. I do find if i don't let him have his awake time in the late afternoon by putting him down he wants to do it around 7 which is when i put my toddler to sleep. Just easier for me to get toddler sleeping if baby is sleeping as hegets excited when he hears his brother. I wouldn't worry about too much sleep from babywearing unless there is some other underlying condition and so long as baby wakes enough to eat."

babywearing,2yzhkb,whambat,1 point,Sun Mar 15 15:58:25 2015 UTC,They are very popular and in high demand. I've had no luck helping a friend score one when they're released on Thursdays. Your best bet is to join the closed exchange groups on facebook  (like Kinderpack <3 Love)
babywearing,2yzhkb,mugsywebb,1 point,Sun Mar 15 16:49:59 2015 UTC,I was totally going to say this! I'm in ga and the baby abd I both run really really hot but we do fine in our kp. This dinner I'll probably just add a frog togg blanket between us
babywearing,2yzhkb,mmabpa,1 point,Sat Mar 14 14:10:45 2015 UTC,Ditto on the Kinderpack with koolnit. Both me and baby are less sweaty :)
babywearing,2yzhkb,mytwobabies,2,Sat Mar 14 14:41:03 2015 UTC,"We live in AZ where it is not unexpected for temps to rise to 110 in the summer. I just picked up the Ergo Ventus and so far we love it. We tried with my 22 month on a 80+ day to the zoo recently and it worked out pretty well. The mesh is incredibly helpful. With our organic Ergo we would get pretty toasty but the Ventus seemed to definitely work better in the warmer temperatures.  I was also worried about how high it looked with not much room for baby's head to move around, but DS didn't seem to mind and it was a good height for him. I bet you can adjust it to better suit your baby.  We are actually headed out to CA to spend a couple days a at Disneyland and high temps are expected to be in the mid 90s. I'll let you know how it goes carrying DS in the Ventus if you'd like. Good luck with your decision."
babywearing,2yzhkb,mytwobabies,1 point,Sat Mar 14 07:10:04 2015 UTC,I'd love to hear how the Ventus does at Disney! It looks to be comfortable for the adult so that's definitely a plus.
babywearing,2yzhkb,meeksthecat,2,Sat Mar 14 13:04:47 2015 UTC,"I'm back with a final report! :)  So the Ventus worked out pretty well. I was pleased anyway. It was definitely comfortable for me to wear the whole time and my back and shoulders never got tired or strained (I'm 5'5"", 140 lbs; DS is 32"", 27ish lbs). I even wore it during peak hours with temps in the 90s. We brought the stroller too, but when we had to wait in line for 20-30 minutes, I brought the Ventus with me for me to wear him in since we had to park the stroller. I wouldn't really recommended wearing for more time than that (<30 minutes) as it is just so hot no matter what carrier you use. The mesh lining helped, but it would get sweaty for both of us whereever we were touching (I front carried him inwards so his chest and belly on mine). I think this would happen no matter what carrier you would use in 90 degree weather though. Hope this helps and good luck making a decision if you haven't already.  Here is a picture of us in Disneyland!"

babywearing,2yzhkb,cranappley,1 point,Sat Mar 14 19:17:49 2015 UTC,I wish the waist belt on that was a little thicker/more padded. It looks like it will probably cut into my belly. Otherwise it looks pretty perfect!
babywearing,2yy4bm,raiu86,6,Fri Mar 13 20:24:03 2015 UTC,Kinderpack with plus straps for sure! If he is taller than the stated height for a beco (or whatever) the straps will probably dig in under his arms and he won't want to use it because it will be uncomfortable. The plus straps on a kp will help eliminate this issue.
babywearing,2yy4bm,Jennchilada,5,Sat Mar 14 01:45:45 2015 UTC,"Do you want a soft structured carrier? The Ergo Performance works well on my 6'2"" husband, with plenty of room for adjustment. The only adjustment that might be too small is the strap that goes across the shoulder blades or chest, depending on the position. If he is really broad-chested, it may be too small.   You can also make wraps for the earlier days from cotton jersey. You get two out of it, so you could cut a longer wrap for your husband, and standard sized wrap for you."
babywearing,2yy4bm,spazzycakes,4,Fri Mar 13 21:11:50 2015 UTC,"I suggest going to a Babywearing meeting in your area. You both will be able to learn about and try on a huge variety of carriers, try them on, etc."
babywearing,2yy4bm,silentcecilia,3,Fri Mar 13 22:58:19 2015 UTC,Look at babywearing international and see if there is a chapter near you. They have lending libraries so you can try out carriers before you buy one.
babywearing,2yy4bm,msuaussiemom,3,Fri Mar 13 23:08:58 2015 UTC,"Ergo makes an the ergo xtra, which has longer straps for taller/heavier parents. You might need to order it from their site, but it looks like it might be good for your husband."

Not sure of any height max, but I've heard people saying the straps are longer and can fit a wider variety of body types. I love mine and so does my 6 foot tall husband.

babywearing,2yutfr,DutchessOfDiapers,2,Fri Mar 13 00:07:35 2015 UTC,A woven wrap on the back and an Ergo in front is a great option and can be done very early with lots of practice. The twingo is a great carrier once they get bigger :) Congrats!
babywearing,2yutfr,iliketoasttoo,2,Fri Mar 13 01:50:48 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! I have always wanted a woven wrap!
babywearing,2yutfr,blue_ash,1 point,Fri Mar 13 02:43:39 2015 UTC,"Hi!!! Congrats!!!  I love wearing my twins, and it's insanely handy now that they're walking because they really do run in different directions!  I currently use a beco on the front and a beco on the back at 14 months and 22lbs ish each.  When they were younger (until approx 7 months) I wore them in one size 7 woven, front and back. You actually can safely wear a newborn on your back in a woven wrap. (Not in a stretchy, nor in a  soft-structured.) I recommend getting a woven because they're so versatile and practicing the high back newborn carry with a doll as much as possible,  because it is so handy to have the confidence.  wow, twins! Welcome to the club :)"
babywearing,2yutfr,Jennchilada,2,Fri Mar 13 06:59:49 2015 UTC,"I consider myself a pretty experienced wrapper and yet I can't wrap my mind around putting a newb on my back! My twins are due in August and I can't wait to wear them, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't mildly terrified about trying to wear them both as newbs!"
babywearing,2yutfr,blue_ash,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:26:33 2015 UTC,"Oh man, knowing how to back wrap with confidence is magical,  I tell ya. ""Tandem babywearing"" is a great group on facebook. Again, I highly recommend practicing with a doll. Newbs are actually really easy to wear on the back because they're not squirmy. Since you're an experienced wrapper,  you know the basics of how a wrap should feel, so you can learn a back carry for sure! Confidence amd common sense are key!"

Did you still buy 2 infant bucket seats since you wear them? We only used our stroller with our toddler like twice, and but I'm wondering if we should invest in a double car seat stroller or not.  I would much rather have a couple of nice wraps and just get 2 good convertible seats! What is your opinion?"
babywearing,2yutfr,blue_ash,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:55:02 2015 UTC,"I didnt use a stroller much actually,  I just had a double jogging stroller that I got for 50$. and I used it in the summer to haul stuff at the beach, etc haha. I just never got the hang of strollers and much prefer wrapping and wearing. If you have money and space to store strollers, get a nice used unit. We didn't have either of those things, so it was an easy choice not to buy one and I never once wished I had."

I've been through so many carriers and by far the most comfortable tandem carry is two Tula carriers. I have a woven wrap that I used with my standard Tula and it's not very comfortable for long periods of time now that the girls are older.

babywearing,2y7elx,girlonbike,5,Sat Mar 7 03:02:05 2015 UTC,A mei tai is a more open-sided carrier and does not provide the kind of trunk support a small baby needs. Hold off on back carries until baby is sitting independently. See if you have a babywearing group locally. Hands-on help is invaluable when learning new skills. Here is a link for future reference when you little one is ready for back carries.   http://www.babyhawk.com/instructions-1/
babywearing,2y7elx,fancypig,1 point,Sat Mar 7 04:20:20 2015 UTC,"The BWI recommendation is 6 months or when baby can sit on her own. Before doing back carries, a hip carry is a good way to go if she doesn't hit that milestone for a while (which is normal to take longer than 6months, btw).  You know baby is ready for the hip carry when you start carrying her on your hip around the house. Hip carries can be done with your mei tai, but like /u/fancypig said, the sides will be open, but your arm is there to give support if needed."
babywearing,2y7elx,MamaJay,1 point,Sat Mar 7 16:44:13 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  What they say makes sense.  Here's my experience.  My 2nd was born in 2006 and I had her on my back in a mei tai when she was one day old.  I used the instructions for the ""newborn high back carry"" on the Kozy carrier website.  I searched on the Kozy site to see if the newborn high back carry instructions are still up.  They're not but there are instructions labeled just ""high back carry"" that are very similar.  Of course the important thing is practice, practice, practice!  I did all my back carries over a bed or couch until I got really good at them.     item 1 Photo 1, newborn in high back carry using a mei tai  item 2 Photo 2, newborn in high back carry using a mei tai"
babywearing,2y66o6,SrslyYouToo,2,Fri Mar 6 20:29:49 2015 UTC,"I'd invest in a woven wrap, that way you can back carry with your 7 month old. the moby is good for a little baby but becomes less supportive and more stretched out with more weight also you can only front carry with it.  im 24 wks pregnant with a 27 month old son and I carry him in a wrap conversion ring sling aka a ring sling made from a woven wrap."
babywearing,2y66o6,ludaachristyy,1 point,Fri Mar 6 21:50:35 2015 UTC,"The best thing to do will be to try to find a Babywearing group in your area. BWI has groups in many cities, or there are other local groups. Most groups have a lending library if all different types of carriers. At meetings you can try on carriers, chat with other moms, and learn how to use different carriers from trained experts. If you join the group you can check out carriers and take them home for a few weeks or months at a time. It's also a great way to meet other moms and give your babe some social time. They will have lots of experience wearing while pregnant as well. Good luck!"
babywearing,2y66o6,silentcecilia,1 point,Sat Mar 7 15:30:27 2015 UTC,My wife just got a DidyTai Lisca Smeraldo and loves how it fits. She's able to wear our kids without any strain on her tummy and it sizes down to newborn.
babywearing,2y66o6,geekathair,1 point,Tue Mar 10 17:59:29 2015 UTC,"I'd echo the above: go to a group and get some hands on advice, or talk to local experienced mums who have carried while pregnant. I'm 21w and have a 3.5 yo so slightly different as he walks most of the time. Options which are working for us are basically woven wraps, I can just about do a fwcc if it's a rock solid wrap. Back carries I can do tied tibetan and passes spread if it's a long up or knot less ruck still works if it's a quicky. Podegei are nice in pregnancy if you feel overwhelmed by a wrap, or reverse half buckles (buckled shoulders and mei tais waist). Hip carries with something a bit more solid (eg woven wrap, ring sling, scootababy ssc) , might work, see how you go, I find them too uncomfortable with being off centre."
babywearing,2y3b84,liabenn,5,Fri Mar 6 01:50:26 2015 UTC,"That shop looks to be good quality--the stitching is three rows, which is important, she uses sling rings, also important, and the fabric looks safe, though it's impossible to tell for sure. Safety is the biggest concern when buying from an etsy seller.  If you go for the etsy seller,  I definitely recommend linen. Cotton gauze is very thin and typically won't be very supportive. It would probably start to dig and become uncomfortable before too long.  For that price, I'd give it a try. Keep in mind it may not be as supportive as a sakura (no way to tell for sure) but regardless I don't think it would ruin ring slings for you."
babywearing,2y3b84,Trinket90,3,Fri Mar 6 02:15:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you! That was really informative. I didn't know to look at the stitching and, yes I agree, safety is super important."
babywearing,2y3b84,Axora,2,Fri Mar 6 03:13:03 2015 UTC,"I bought a linen ring sling from Etsy, seller Bibetts and I really like it. It seems to be quite the same as the one you listed above. Same stitching, rings from Sling Rings.   I was the same as you, didn't want to get a expensive brand RS till I was sure I would like it. The one I bought from etsy was a really good starter RS. I say go for it.   (Turns out I didn't even use it thought much at first. Only now, at about 6 months old, am I using it that much. I'd been using my Ergo and Tula a lot.)"
babywearing,2y3b84,Trinket90,2,Fri Mar 6 03:41:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I think I'll end up using mine mostly from 4 weeks-5 months although I do love the way the older babies look in it. I just figured I would use the boba after that.
babywearing,2y3b84,34F,1 point,Fri Mar 6 04:08:22 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, ring slings are my absolute #1 choice for newborns. They're so easy to adjust, so quick compared to wraps or even buckle carriers once you get used to them, and they accommodate nursing so well.   Once my kids get older I tend to go for something two shoulder (mei tai is my preference) for more support. Some people like slings for older kids, though, and you can't beat it for quick ups and downs."
babywearing,2y3b84,Axora,1 point,Fri Mar 6 14:14:27 2015 UTC,I also have one from Bibetts and it's fine. It helped me learn that I'm not a huge fan of ring slings so I guess that's good! But it works in a pinch and is small and lightweight enough to live in the diaper bag.
babywearing,2y3b84,Jennchilada,1 point,Fri Mar 6 19:16:23 2015 UTC,Haha!   I felt the same way about ring slings till recently. When my daughter was new I really didn't like ring slings at all. Now that she's just about 6 months I actually love them more than my other carriers.
babywearing,2y3b84,mellontree,1 point,Fri Mar 6 19:23:51 2015 UTC,"Safety is super important, especially with ringslings. There are some pretty strict rules regarding baby carrier production and sales that recently went into effect (some think they are optional but they definitely are not!) so I would check to see if that shop is compliant with all of those new regs to assure that the sling you are purchasing is safe."
babywearing,2y3b84,geekathair,1 point,Fri Mar 6 07:02:40 2015 UTC,"Whilst I agree with most of what Trinket90 said, personally I would go with cotton as it will be softer and more mouldable for a little squishy. Linen blends are great but more suited to bigger kids."

babywearing,2y0mab,ouibonjourmadame,2,Thu Mar 5 12:55:08 2015 UTC,"I would say go for it! I can't attest to the 22lbs because my lil one is 16lbs right now, but they are amazing! I put it off because of the price (and already having a ssc). Found one dirty cheap at a consignment sale and it has been my go to. Comfy, fast and fits into the diaper bag so I know I always have a carrier"
babywearing,2y0mab,mugsywebb,1 point,Thu Mar 5 13:34:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I have a 7sling I put in the diaper bag. That thing is so not comfy I never use it. That would replace it.
babywearing,2y0mab,mugsywebb,2,Thu Mar 5 16:40:25 2015 UTC,Check online too. There are lots of good prices. I had my eyes staked on the Facebook page babywearing on a budget and just happened to see the exact rs in the exact print I had wanted hanging right in front at a consignment sale. It was like it was meant to be lol  Gosh those are so uncomfortable! But I tried using the lbs I had from my first when I was way smaller lol
babywearing,2y0mab,mugsywebb,1 point,Thu Mar 5 16:54:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I got babywearing on a budget and stuff like that but most don't ship to Canada. It's 60$ for the sling which I think is a good price.
babywearing,2y0mab,OutdoorNerd,2,Thu Mar 5 18:58:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah it really isn't bad at all! I use mine so much I wish I hadn't been so tight fisted about $60 when my son was first born. Heck, I paid $200 on my kp and didn't even blink yet 60 was making me question lol. And I reach for the rs more"
babywearing,2y0mab,OutdoorNerd,2,Fri Mar 6 13:57:31 2015 UTC,Is there a babywearing group in your area with a lending library? I was convinced I wanted a ring sling until I borrowed one for a month.  It definitely wasn't for me.  I suggest trying one out for a few days if you can.
babywearing,2y0mab,shadeofmyheart,1 point,Thu Mar 5 13:40:26 2015 UTC,Yeah maybe I should  Thwre is a store they rent baby carriers so you can try them. What didn't you like about it?
babywearing,2y0mab,peaceandkim,2,Thu Mar 5 16:41:03 2015 UTC,"For me it was awkward to have the weight not distributed evenly.  My lil guy weighs 22 lbs and tends to want to pop his seat.  He kicks his legs out straight & leans back- lifting his butt up.    I just didn't feel secure enough with him in the ring sling and he felt heaaaavy!   I have an Ergo and a Tula.  Currently I'm borrowing a woven wrap and am experimenting with some basic front carries.  I feel like he is much more supported and less likely to wiggle free.     Plenty of people love the ring slings but I personally can't be 'hands free' with one with my guy.    They are super convenient though. This long wrap I have right now seems intimidating if I were to try to go out with it.  I usually use my buckle carriers shopping, etc."
babywearing,2y0mab,peaceandkim,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:55:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I know wgat you mean. I'm afraid my daughter would be just like that. I really need to try it first.
babywearing,2y0mab,momonomicon,2,Thu Mar 5 21:50:26 2015 UTC,I wore my LO in a ring along from 6 month and up.  It pulls on shoulders asymmetrically so it hurts my back after about 30 min. If you want a carrier for longer I would go with a soft structured carrier like ergo or Tula. I think it will be pretty good for the new one tho!
babywearing,2y0mab,momonomicon,1 point,Thu Mar 5 14:41:49 2015 UTC,Teah I have a structured one and it's an equavalent of the tula + tula toddler. I just love it. I also have a stretchy wrap but I thought if I want to tandem babywear I won't be happy with that..
babywearing,2y0mab,momonomicon,2,Thu Mar 5 16:42:34 2015 UTC,LOVEEE my ring sling! My daughter is 21 pounds (17 months) and we still use it.
babywearing,2y0mab,momonomicon,1 point,Thu Mar 5 14:55:55 2015 UTC,Oh lord I won't how much my daughter will weight at 17 months. She's 12 months now but is definetly putting on weight slower now.
babywearing,2y0mab,bluegatoradedrink,2,Thu Mar 5 16:43:14 2015 UTC,Yeah I think my daughter has gained 2 pounds since 9 months to 18 months. She's barely 21 pounds now.

He's changed our hospital and I wish everyone here used him. When I started going to him I never had to wait to be seen. So many women have switched to him that the wait got worse and worse the further my pregnancy went. Hahahaha!  He's amazing and if I had got to carry to term I would have had one awesome labor! :)
babywearing,2xpdym,sammallama,2,Tue Mar 3 06:07:47 2015 UTC,"Ha! It's such a shame that there are so few natural-friendly ob's to go around. My ob is one of the less intervention inclined, but even her c section rates are like 30%! I think things are headed in the right direction, though, so that's good. There's talk of a birth center up here, in fact...."
babywearing,2xpdym,SugarandSass,1 point,Tue Mar 3 13:30:07 2015 UTC,Wow!  I know he will avoid it. My friend was in labor for 72 hours. Didn't want a c section and he was bound and determined to give her her dream birth story. But she gave in and asked for the c section - he wouldn't have came any other way. I feel so bad for her but Every birth story is beautiful no matter how your baby came. And I hope she can have a vbac one day if she ever tries for another.
babywearing,2xpdym,mundanefemale,3,Tue Mar 3 16:45:41 2015 UTC,That is such a cool thing for an OB to do. :)
babywearing,2xpbd1,dalikin,2,Mon Mar 2 20:00:16 2015 UTC,"Pure cotton is the best choice for a beginner,  in my opinion. Linen needs quite a bit of breaking in, especially if you get one of Natibaby's wraps. Hemp is even worse. Silk is nice, bamboo too, but both have a habit of shifting in the beginning."
babywearing,2xpbd1,dunemaire,2,Tue Mar 3 09:52:58 2015 UTC,"I have an Oscha linen/cotton ring sling. It hasn't bee terrible to break in yet, but it isn't floppy. I LOVE my bamboo/cotton blend, and I have it in a 7,which you would definitely want to be able to do multi-pass carries for a heavier kid Since either is so thin. 100% cotton is fab for a beginner though too :)"

I have found facebook good for this, the local BWI has a page and I just ask there."
babywearing,2xoyxo,Meilikah,2,Mon Mar 2 18:38:56 2015 UTC,"That was a tricky time for us, but it got better around 6 months, when I started putting him on my back :)"
babywearing,2xoyxo,RayningAcid,1 point,Mon Mar 2 19:31:22 2015 UTC,"Many people find four months old to be a tricky time, babies tend to get very nosy, and want to see everything.  Front facing carriers, though, can be uncomfortable for moms, so maybe see if he likes a hip carry?  That way he can still look at what's happening.  If he's not too heavy, you could hip carry in the Moby, or you can do it in a mei tai, but it's not the most comfortable positioning, as you end up with all the weight on one shoulder."
babywearing,2xoyxo,merveilleuse_,1 point,Mon Mar 2 19:25:56 2015 UTC,"Our LO can get quite fussy if I wear her in a front carry facing my tummy - she wants to see everything, so she's far happier in a hip carry. The Moby can only really comfortably be used up to 6 months, so you could always sell it to fund your ring sling :)"

babywearing,2xmixp,momonomicon,2,Mon Mar 2 03:53:56 2015 UTC,"Yep, onsnaburg and cotton gauze are common choices. Hemming takes a while, I recommend picking up a rolled hem foot. Less than 10 bucks in most cases, and it cuts the time it takes in at least half. They do take a bit of skill to use, but if you just take it slow - ish you shouldn't make any mistakes.  It won't be the same as a true woven, though.  Nothing wrong with them, but they don't distribute weight quite as well and they're not as strong."

babywearing,2xdx59,withlovesparrow,5,Fri Feb 27 19:55:41 2015 UTC,"I can't give a great comparison since I've never tried the mei tai, but I can tell you I LOVE my k'tan!  I got it when Miss J was about 4 weeks old and used it fine starting then, but it could've been used earlier if I had it right away.  It is very easy to get the hang of basic wearing, Miss J is 15 months now and still easily fits but I don't wear her as long or as often anymore.  Nursing in it took a little practice, but once we figured it out I loved it.  I'd recommend practicing at home in front of a mirror to master it.  As she got bigger, even though she still fit great in the k'tan it was harder to get her as low as she needed to be in order to nurse in it.  I also remember reading that if you have especially large or especially small breasts nursing in it can be tricky.  Another pro is that the sash is also the carrying case, which makes throwing it in the diaper bag super easy and compact.  One last note, if I were to buy again I would buy the ""breeze"" kind, I wore Miss J plenty during outdoors summer activities and the extra ventilation would've been very nice."
babywearing,2xdx59,MommaK4CJ,2,Fri Feb 27 20:51:43 2015 UTC,I've never tried the K'Tan but I have the Mei Tei. I am returning it to Amazon tomorrow. It is so uncomfortable. It put tremendous strain on my shoulders.   I decided I need a carrier with more structure and support. I have ordered the ErgoBaby but I'm pretty sure you can't nurse in it.
babywearing,2xdx59,MamaJay,2,Fri Mar 6 00:07:49 2015 UTC,"You can totally nurse in it! There are adjustable straps under your armpits, that you just loosen (keep a hand on the baby at all times!) to the point where the baby can reach you.  Always bring baby back up to the point where you can kiss his/her head when you're finished though.    If you still have the mei tai, have you tried tying tibetian? I found that takes off some of the strain from my shoulders."
babywearing,2xdx59,MamaJay,2,Mon Mar 16 13:22:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips. Hopefully they can help someone else. =)  I returned both the ErgoBaby and the MeiTai. Baby hated ErgoBaby and I hated MeiTai. I'm anxiously awaiting the arrival of my Tula - it's my last shot at baby wearing.
babywearing,2xdx59,monkey_feather,3,Mon Mar 16 17:39:22 2015 UTC,"I hate SSCs in general.  Almost all of them are way too big for a petite woman.  My husband loves the Ergo, but I can't stand it. The Beco Gemini and the Beco Solei are the only ones that are even remotely comfortable on me.  I don't own one, but I've played with them at my local BWI chapter. I love wrapping for the versatility, and the ring sling for toddlers.   Don't let the Tula be your last try if it doesn't work out! See if you have a local BWI chapter and make use of the lending library before you buy another carrier."
babywearing,2xdx59,Wtfguysreally,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:32:25 2015 UTC,"It does sound like the mei tai would be a better fit for you! It's quick and easy, can be used for a variety of carries, and can be used a long time (I'm still using it with my 30 lb toddler). The other option is a ring sling. Are you on Facebook? There are a few groups like Babywearing 102, babywearing on a budget (everything there is under $100), or babywearing diy advice and support if you're crafty. It's nice to see things in action.   I had the most luck nursing in my soft structured carrier, like an ergo, lillebaby or tula, once my little one was around 4 months. I never used the katan but my understanding is that it's only for little littles.   Hope that helps!"
babywearing,2xdx59,Sunna3,1 point,Fri Feb 27 20:49:55 2015 UTC,"You can make a k'tan type out of shirts to give it a try. I have mei tei and I LOVE IT! The moby isn't as complicated as it seems but it is more time consuming.  Do you sew? There's a diy baby wearing group and with their help I've made a handful of mei teis and I can barley sew a straight line. Worse comes to worse, you can make a k'tan and buy a mei tei for under $50."
babywearing,2xdx59,Aloof_pooch,1 point,Fri Feb 27 22:32:57 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the easiest first carrier is a ring sling.  The maya wrap ones are decently priced and pretty nice.  I got the one without the padded shoulder so I can spread it out more."
babywearing,2xdx59,MamaJay,1 point,Sat Feb 28 02:41:21 2015 UTC,I love my Baby K'tan. It is so easy to get on and very comfortable. I've been using it since 3 weeks and she is 4 months now. I will use an Ergo when she gets bigger and I want more support for longer walks and such.  I have never been able to nurse in any wrap or carrier because I think I am too big.
babywearing,2xdx59,CreativeHooker,1 point,Sat Feb 28 20:47:55 2015 UTC,"Mei Tais will last a lot longer than the k'tan will.  The k'tan only fits one person (and it's very very easy to get the wrong size).  The mei tai would fit your SO, a grandparent, older sibling, etc. When the baby is a newborn, you can fold the waist up, and use a string to cinch the waist. You can front, back and hip carry as well, while with the k'tan you can only front carry."
babywearing,2xdx59,GattiGialli,1 point,Mon Mar 16 13:20:18 2015 UTC,"I started with a K'tan and ended up returning it. I couldn't get the right size, and felt like my baby wasn't secure. I didn't like that I couldn't tighten it. I also have a Mei tai l, I tried the waist  rolling thing when she was a newborn and it just didn't work for me. Baby was slouched when I tried to put her in it, which wasn't often because she hated it and wanted out right away. I'm hoping once she gets a bit bigger she will be more comfortable in it. I know you said the Moby looks too complicated, but honestly it's been a lifesaver for me. It does take some getting the used to, especially if your fairly new to babywearing like me. But once you get the hang of it, it's quick and easy to get on and my baby loves it. Other than that, maybe a tula with an insert? The ergo with insert is comfortable, but I wish I had just gone with the tula from the beginning. The price of the tula is what held me back. I feel it distributes the baby's weight much better than the ergo, and has more padding so it's more comfy for both me and baby. Also, you could just go with a woven wrap, but they can get pricey fast.   edit: whatever you decide to go with, if it hurts you to wear it post here before returning it. Sometimes a small correction to how you are wearing the wrap/carrier can make a world of difference."

They ARE great carriers, but only marginally more than lets say, an Ergo.   It's more of a status/brand craze.   The Tulas that people are spending HUNDREDS to thousands of dollars on are the wrap conversion Tulas.   The contest thing you mentioned, that shit is absolutely madness. It's not a contest to WIN one. No no. It's a contest for the opportunity to BUY one. For usually >$300."

We got a great deal on a very lightly used one, but still only saved about $40-50 from new if I remember correctly.  I've heard ones with fancier prints even go up in value depending on rarity.  If you're looking for a good/cheaper alternative suggestion, I use an older model Ergo and prefer it to the Tula."

It turns out the Sport doesn't cinch as small as Original Ergos at the waist and I've run out of cinching room (hurray?).  It's still great for my husband, so I don't want to sell it.  But I need something that fits and I figure if I have to buy a new carrier, sometime different would be fun.  Tulas seem to hold their value well here too (Canada).  I haven't seen one under $250 in the Canadian boards I'm in.  :("

Anyway, they haven't had much for retailers to order lately because they're pushing new patterns every week instead of stocking the usual ones but I do have some in stock. I charge $185 plus tax and $10 shipping comes in around $205. So buying new can be cheaper, and buying in canada is cheaper than buying from the American website after the exchange and duties."

I just got one new from the site on Friday and it will be here tomorrow. Thankfully it shipped from Ca and not Poland.  Agree... such a hassle messing with all those facebook things. Look for a local retailer or find a canvas print on the site. Good news when/if you sell it you should be able to get your money back.  Oh! forgot to add some sites have seconds, slightly used or a small issue with the print. It wont affect the over all safety of the Tula at all. The only one I've heard of is http://www.frogmama.com/tula-standard-and-toddler-carrier.html , but I know there are others too."

babywearing,2x08a2,bonjourtabby,4,Tue Feb 24 17:02:32 2015 UTC,"The bit that you have tied round his back, don't do that. It won't be supportive and won't allow his back to have a natural curve. Instead, spread each strap out and pull it underneath the opposite leg, then tie behind your back. These are not great pics, but they kind of illustrate what I mean http://imgur.com/a/zpRqB if you're still unsure, come back to me. Don't forget, he does need to be high and tight.  Edit: just saw that you said there's not enough fabric to tie round your back. Really? There looks to be plenty there. Pull him higher and tighter and see if that helps."

babywearing,2x08a2,mellontree,1 point,Tue Feb 24 20:13:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the straps just barely meet behind my back so I can't really tie it that way unfortunately. Maybe when I lose some more of the baby weight...  I tried to tie it behind his butt rather than his back, although the instructions that came with the carrier say to tie it behind his back. I didn't think that seemed right so I've been tying it lower. Maybe I'm just not cut out for the Mei Tai because no matter how high and tight I try to make it, it always sags. And it feels like it makes it hard for me to breathe so I imagine it's really tight on the baby...yet it still sags..."

babywearing,2x08a2,NerdtasticHG,1 point,Tue Feb 24 19:52:50 2015 UTC,"This carrier has shorter straps, so this is a common problem. I would tie under the bum in front instead of behind the back. Behind the back is an older recommendation but because it places pressure on baby's spine under the bum is preferable. Where are the straps sitting on your shoulders? I find it more comfortable when the are spread wide on my shoulders instead of closer my neck."
babywearing,2x08a2,alisonjw1288,1 point,Wed Feb 25 16:43:27 2015 UTC,I'll try adjusting the shoulder straps! I just put them in the middle of my shoulder but maybe it will be more comfortable wider. Thanks!
babywearing,2x0fz3,poopybuttfart,3,Tue Feb 24 17:58:22 2015 UTC,Have you thought about a ring sling? Great for quick ups and downs.
babywearing,2x0fz3,mellontree,1 point,Tue Feb 24 18:13:00 2015 UTC,I'm actually looking at a sewing tutorial for one right now (along with 15 other tutorials). Could I leave it on and just pop her in it without a ton of adjusting?
babywearing,2x0fz3,mellontree,2,Tue Feb 24 18:50:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah pretty much. Obvs you need to adjust but with an rs it's pretty quick, and it stays on your body."
babywearing,2x0fz3,geekathair,1 point,Tue Feb 24 20:12:48 2015 UTC,I agree. I usually have one on under my jacket when we are out and about because it's SO easy to get them in and out safely. I've enjoyed our Sakura Bloom Linen for both the 1 and 3yo's.
babywearing,2x0fz3,MrsWhovian,3,Thu Feb 26 16:56:03 2015 UTC,"My son is very attached to me at the moment but still wants to assert his independence (15mo). I usually just pre-tie a poppable carry like front cross carry and wear it all day. It's very convenient.   I also second the ring sling. Very quick and very versatile. Toddlers in ring slings can get heavy quickly, so if they're genuinely short ups, I would go with a sling. But, if she wants to be worn for 30 minutes or more, a pre-tie poppable carry would be my best bet."
babywearing,2x0fz3,MrsWhovian,2,Tue Feb 24 18:58:55 2015 UTC,Thank you! She's a pretty big baby so that's definitely something to consider. I think I'll try keeping it pre-tied for now and see how that goes. If it doesn't work I'll try the sling.
babywearing,2x0fz3,debosaurus,2,Tue Feb 24 20:33:10 2015 UTC,Glad to help! :)
babywearing,2x0fz3,fancypig,3,Tue Feb 24 20:40:43 2015 UTC,You can continue to use your wrap (assuming it is a woven) but use a poppable hip carry? Instead of investing in a ring sling. Robins is a popular one. Great for Quick ups/downs.
babywearing,2x0fz3,cranappley,2,Tue Feb 24 22:56:29 2015 UTC,"What kind of wrap are you using? If it's a stretchy they are super poppable. I it's a woven then front cross carry is a poppable option. I agree with the ring sling recommendation, it is awesome for and up and down kiddo!"
babywearing,2x0fz3,enshrina,1 point,Wed Feb 25 16:46:02 2015 UTC,It's stretchy. I gave pre-tied poppable a try yesterday and it went okay. It was a little annoying to get her legs in over and over but I think I'm gonna try a few different holds and see which works best.
babywearing,2x0fz3,enshrina,2,Wed Feb 25 17:03:43 2015 UTC,"We used rebozo hip carry with size 3/4 when ds was like this, meant I still had a long enough wrap to do a front/back carry if needs be. I use my 2s as scarves,nothing else."

babywearing,2wtx8x,pinkpowerranger8,1 point,Mon Feb 23 06:56:36 2015 UTC,I haven't tried it yet but you're supposed to be able to breast feed in a babyk'tan.
babywearing,2wtx8x,mitche27,1 point,Mon Feb 23 04:09:18 2015 UTC,"Also I didn't have much success until lo was a little older, 3 months or so"
babywearing,2wtx8x,pinkpowerranger8,1 point,Mon Feb 23 06:57:20 2015 UTC,"You really can breastfeed in any style carrier, they just all need their own kind of adjusting. The main thing is to get baby low enough to easily access the breast while in a sitting position. In the SSC try loosening the shoulder straps slightly and then loosening the waistband slightly to lower the carrier and the. Cinch everything right in the lower position. for the mei tai you may not need to drop the waist, just untying and lowering baby might be enough. When you are done then tighten everything back up with baby in a kissable position.   It may not be hands free with a baby that young. And it will take practice! Do it at home, practice lots of times at home where the pressure is off so it's no big deal when you need to do it while out. :)"
babywearing,2wtx8x,fancypig,1 point,Wed Feb 25 16:50:37 2015 UTC,"The ring sling is the fastest to adjust.  It's just the breast on the same side as the rings is slightly awkward at first... you have to put baby in the cradle position for that one.  Of course, always bring baby back up to be able to kiss his/her head after!"

I put my baby in a fleece snow suit type thing over his clothes and a hat, and I zip my coat up around him as well. He is older, 7 months, so he is always craning his neck to look around and his nose does get cold, but when we get home the rest if his body is warm. He gets a lot of warmth from my body heat! I pay attention to the wind chill and wouldn't personally take him out for a walk if it felt like less than about 15F, but then again I wouldn't take myself on an outdoor walk when its that cold."

babywearing,2wkfbg,bambiontheshore,2,Fri Feb 20 18:55:21 2015 UTC,"The ""rule"" for dressing a baby is dress him how you would dress yourself, plus one layer. If you don't have a snowsuit for little, then footie pajamas a size up should work well enough. I also take a bigger blanket and fold it into a triangle, with the fold up by baby's neck. Then wrap the side corners around baby and tuck into the carrier, and the bottom corner tuck under his butt and against my belly.   Generally speaking, the baby will let you know if he is uncomfortable. Just keep an eye on him and listen to what he tells you."
babywearing,2wkfbg,bambiontheshore,3,Fri Feb 20 19:51:34 2015 UTC,It's worth pointing out that a wrap counts as at least three layers. My daughter only wears one layer (usually thin footed pjs) under the moby and I wear one layer and an oversized fleece lined coat that I zip up around her. If she wears any more layers we both overheat.
babywearing,2wkfbg,spaceheater,2,Fri Feb 20 23:34:50 2015 UTC,We overheat if I do too much as is with her wearing a single onesie inside. :/
babywearing,2wkfbg,Flewtea,2,Sat Feb 21 02:07:39 2015 UTC,"It's awful being a fast overheater isn't it. If we're walking farther than say to our village shop (10-15 minutes one way) I just wear one of those super thin running jackets, enough to break the wind/rain but breathable. I don't put a hat on her, just make sure one side of the wrap loosely covers the back of her head if it needs to (our other carriers have hoods too) so that she's protected but still has a way to regulate her temperature. And I don't wear a hat either, feels like I'm having a heat stroke when I do."

She was still totally warm and happy when we got there and then again when we got back and I live in MN, so it's pretty cold here too."

babywearing,2wkfbg,MaggieMae716,2,Sat Feb 21 01:49:29 2015 UTC,"I've found that all I really need to worry about with the baby is the parts that aren't covered by the wrap. So, basically, head and feet. Baby legs are great for this purpose! You can just pull them up to his knees and let the excess hang, or kind of scrunch them around his feet. (Put them over pants and socks.) Everything else, as you've noticed, gets super toasty thanks to your body heat!"

babywearing,2wbz5x,Meilikah,3,Wed Feb 18 18:31:39 2015 UTC,I gave mine away because i didn't like the buckle. When babywearing in an SSC the point is a quick up and down click and done! (in my perspective) However I physically couldn't reach over to get the buckle undone with the two hands it requires unless you are weirdly finger talented. I would highly suggest finding someone who has one or a store and trying it on to see if you could even physically buckle and unbuckle it. I ended up with a lillebaby and love it.

babywearing,2wbz5x,MamaJay,2,Wed Feb 18 19:45:45 2015 UTC,"The Gemini is a great carrier. All Becos do have the safety feature on the buckles that require both hands to release it. How old is your baby? The Gemini's upper weight limit is 35lbs and it has a smaller base, so I tend to recommend it for younger babies.   Soft structured carriers tend to fit different people differently, so it is ideal if you can try them out to see what fits you best. You can look for a local babywearing group and see what they have available to try on!"

Depending on which carrier you have you can put the infant positioner under his bum but have his legs out.
babywearing,2vw4c9,sooza22,2,Sat Feb 14 19:36:49 2015 UTC,"Sorry, yes, between my body and the waist band. It's as tight as i can make it and still move, but his feet are so small they find any gap and wiggle in. It could also be because the carrier is new and stiffer, so the waist strap padding doesn't mold to me fully yet. I'll keep trying and play with his foot position. Thanks!"
babywearing,2vw4c9,Menelly,2,Sat Feb 14 20:52:12 2015 UTC,"You can tie a ribbon around the crotch area to ""narrow"" it a bit so he can sit legs out safely.  :)"
babywearing,2vw4c9,fancypig,1 point,Sun Feb 15 15:33:03 2015 UTC,Unless the manufacturer recommends this practice it is better to wait for baby to grow into the carrier or use the recommended insert. Cinching the panel like that places added stress on the stitching that it wasn't designed to take.
babywearing,2vw4c9,spaceheater,2,Sat Feb 21 00:32:41 2015 UTC,"Rules have changed and froggy legged inside the carrier isn't promoted anymore. Take a hair tie or ribbon and cinch in the seat so it isn't as wide and wear him feet out.  If he's too short in the carrier, roll up a receiving blanket and put it under his bum to make him higher. Forget the insert."
babywearing,2vw4c9,NotQuiteVanilla,2,Sat Feb 14 23:33:44 2015 UTC,Can you give more info about this recommendation?
babywearing,2vw4c9,spaceheater,1 point,Sun Feb 15 06:01:22 2015 UTC,"The Babywearing Institute says feet out from birth now: http://www.babywearingschool.com/research.htm  And the Babywearing International page is giving me a 404 code, so here's Babywearing Faith's interview (she's a BWI educator---feet discussed halfway down). Legs out is advised, but it baby insists on being balled up, the weight must be in baby's bum and not on its feet. If the baby can stand any little bit when in the carrier (meaning its actively pushing with its feet), it's time for legs out. http://dirtydiaperlaundry.com/babywearing-basics-from-bwi-educator-babywearing-faith/  Basically, baby must be seated on in its rear not putting pressure on its feet in anyway. Mine has been feet out since birth...she's not one to be balled up though :)  Here's how to use the receiving blanket: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Czeb3e4WD4  And here's how to cinch the bottom for legs out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGiYTqjFT9E"
babywearing,2vw4c9,fancypig,2,Sun Feb 15 20:15:37 2015 UTC,Try pulling his knees up a little higher to get a deeper seat. With the weight more on his bottom he will have less leverage to push with his legs.

babywearing,2vw4c9,silentcecilia,1 point,Sat Feb 14 23:29:15 2015 UTC,"You can cinch down the base of the carrier with a small piece of cloth, to wear him legs out.  Also make sure the waistband is high on your natural waist or even a little bit up on your lower ribs."
babywearing,2vw4c9,enshrina,1 point,Sun Feb 15 01:17:34 2015 UTC,Roll up a receiving blanket or cloth diaper prefold and put it under baby's bum. It's okay if they're a bit frog legged.

babywearing,2vgfry,woolymarmet,5,Tue Feb 10 20:45:03 2015 UTC,"The Ergo and Gemini should not be worn on the hips but on the waist, for most people.  A wrap might be the best option because it's so customizable.  I would highly recommend going to a local babywearing group meeting - most have lending libraries so you can try on or even borrow many types of carriers.  Most cities have these groups, and it's also a great way to meet other mamas."
babywearing,2vgfry,silentcecilia,2,Wed Feb 11 02:12:44 2015 UTC,"Definitely this. I always had shoulder/neck pain and hip pain when babywearing until I learned that you're not supposed to wear the strap on your hips. Move the waistband up to your natural waist and get a deeper seat on your baby's bum. It really distributes the weight way differently. So much more comfortable now. I also find the Lillebaby to be a good SSC for petite mamas. If the shoulder straps don't tighten enough for your size, you can cross them on your back which helps. Tula has worked really well for me in a front carry, but as a petite mom, I find it harder to get the straps tight enough for a back carry. Boba has funny shaped straps that I think do NOT work well for petite mamas, they dig into your shoulders."
babywearing,2vgfry,sooza22,1 point,Wed Feb 11 05:05:12 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by a hard hip strap? Do you mean the foam in the waist band? If that is your issue, you might try a mei tai. Infantino sells a pretty cheap one that you can find most anywhere."
babywearing,2vgfry,Jennchilada,1 point,Tue Feb 10 21:18:28 2015 UTC,"I meant the structured belt on the Ergo and Beco that puts the weight on your hips. I'm not sure what to call it, I guess.   The Pikkilo is similar to a Mei Tai, so that's why I haven't looked into getting one. I assume I'll have the same problem with my shoulders hurting."
babywearing,2vgfry,Jennchilada,2,Tue Feb 10 21:44:44 2015 UTC,The structured waist belt should actually help alleviate shoulder pain if you are wearing it correctly. That way some of baby's weight would be on your hips as opposed to all of it pulling on your shoulders. Proper use of the chest clip helps alleviate shoulder pain as well.
babywearing,2vgfry,am1986,1 point,Tue Feb 10 22:53:30 2015 UTC,"I can't get the support belt for the Pikkilo to sit on me comfortably. It digs into my hips or waist, no matter how I position it. I just tried it again to see if I could make it work, but no luck. I still hate it. I think it's a problem with how the support belt goes on. It's difficult to describe. But the Pikkilo works much better worn like a Mei Tai, IMO. But that puts the strain of my heavy baby entirely on my shoulders."

babywearing,2vdjpf,owlsayshoot,2,Tue Feb 10 02:58:59 2015 UTC,I would say it might be good as a backup carrier but I wouldn't want to use it all the time. It is a pouch sling which can be difficult to adjust and can therefore potentially lead to unsafe babywearing techniques. I also don't agree with their advertising wearing a baby on your back in their product. That is generally not recommended except for very advanced and highly experienced wearers.

babywearing,2v7kpm,SummerSn0w,6,Sun Feb 8 18:03:30 2015 UTC,"A lot of people who use their tula for little little babies often use the rolled  blanket trick as well. It props them up a bit higher and their legs are still spread froggy but it functions similarly to the infant insert tula offers. If baby is uncomfortable,  they'll let you know. :) I' posted a picture of how to do the blanket  trick below. Also, the link someone else posted above about the hips in a Bjorn  compared to a tula or ergo  is a great illustration and it helps show how much more comfortable it might be to sit that way. The Bjorn isn't hurting baby, but you sure will be much more comfortable carrying him in a tula. We love ours, we can Tula for hours!"

My son is 12 pounds at 6 weeks old.  If I use the ribbon trick to make the seat smaller does that mean I no longer need to buy an infant insert or use a rolled up blanket to support him?

I put her on first and then him as he can stand next to me while I get her in her carrier and is also going to want to get up and down while his sister rarely gets taken out of the carrier when we're out.

If she has good head control and is choosing to snuggle up like that, and can easily lift and turn her own head, then it's not a concern. She won't suffocate herself. If she doesn't have complete head control, the only thing you really can do is continually move her head to the correct place.   Are you making sure she is close enough to kiss? If the baby is nice and high on your chest, she should be sitting with her head on your sternum. If she's up that high, there's no chest to nuzzle into really.

babywearing,2v122f,cj9128,1 point,Fri Feb 6 21:51:01 2015 UTC,"Hi! Ringslings are definitely one of the easier slings to use. For warm weather, I'd suggest either gauze  (calin bleu gauze are very nice and lightweight ) or a high linen blend. Linen is very nice and cool for warm weather, and as it's very strong it should last into toddlerhood. Danu do high linen blends (55% linen 45% cotton)."

I think if you find a brand that you love then you shouldn't feel that you have to like something else that is more popular/HSA/the craze of the week. Enjoy the hell out of your Ergobaby!"
babywearing,2uv0nl,fancypig,3,Thu Feb 5 12:36:46 2015 UTC,"Ergos are great!  But babies grow out of them fairly quickly.  Tulas and Kinder packs are fabulous for toddlers and Ergo can't accommodate toddlers, so there is no competition :-)"

babywearing,2uv0nl,rizzlerazz,1 point,Mon Feb 9 19:32:53 2015 UTC,You need a didy nino. Everyone needs one. They totally look like sperm but there's something about the weave that wraps so well. Indios are nice too.

babywearing,2uv0nl,Meilikah,1 point,Mon Feb 9 23:46:30 2015 UTC,I agree with fancypig. If it fits you and you love it then why change. People really only change if it is uncomfortable for them. I had an Ergo as my first SSC and then switched to a lillebaby (i had to write a review for it so was obligated to wear it around for awhile then fell in love-ish) I really want to try on a tula but still just because they are famously popular and cute doesn't mean that it fits.
babywearing,2uv0nl,mellontree,1 point,Thu Feb 5 18:26:34 2015 UTC,"Funnily enough, I have an Ergo and I don't like it. The panel doesn't seem to come up far enough, amd the back fastening I find to be incredibly tricky and uncomfortable. That said, I have zero loyalty. I am an absolute tart when it comes to carriers. At last count, I have 17. 3 full buckles, a hoptye, 2 ring slings, and 11 woven wraps. And I try to mix it up as often as possible."
babywearing,2uv0nl,Rawrity,1 point,Fri Feb 6 01:07:22 2015 UTC,"The best brand, may be the best brand of the moment, because it's handy, because, it's the one I put in the car, or the one I have close when baby is crying.  Brand loyalty with something like a baby carrier seems silly to me, because it's a device meant to facilitate bonding with your child (and getting life done!) not waving your teams colors or anything else.   While I understand a fondness for a brand that brought you into a wonderful experience, I think it's better for all involved to think like the polish   Not my circus. Not my monkey.  I've never used an ergo for extended periods, because it would not forward face. I have a becco, then I moved to woven wraps and have tried many brands and blends and sizes because they all wrap different and have different flavors for different uses (one for winter, one for quick ups, one for hot texas summers etc).  I tried my friends Tula (who is obcessed) and I HATED it. Kinderpack? I kinda like it. I ended up with a Kanga XT as my primary SSC.   TLDR: Different strokes for different folks. IMHO, brand loyalty is silly for something meant to enhance a relationship."

babywearing,2ur5at,ellemenopeaqu,6,Wed Feb 4 13:57:34 2015 UTC,"I bought a seven sling (eeeeek!) And I bought a balboa baby sling. I tried to get both to work and got so frustrated. I then tried to find a tula, and found a local baby wearing group with a lending library. I went to rent a tula, but it had already been snagged. I rented a boba. I didn't use it as much as I thought I might with my tiny tiny baby. Bought a mei tai, liked that. Someone at the next meeting suggested a ring sling. It was love. I used one until 6 months old, and then I FINALlY got to rent the tula from the library. And 2 weeks later I bought my own.  There's nothing wrong with buying before baby. But I do recommend getting as much play time with actual carriers as you can. You may find that you really love certain carriers, or that you love wrapping but only with certain blends.  Good luck finding what works best!"
babywearing,2ur5at,pinkpowerranger8,1 point,Wed Feb 4 17:58:15 2015 UTC,Ugh I bought 2 seven slings (because deal) and I regret it so bad! Need to exchange them both for different sizes but it just might be a waste of time. Sigh.
babywearing,2ur5at,Lalox,1 point,Wed Feb 4 20:11:22 2015 UTC,"I have a maya wrap (ring sling) for my 2.5 week old, and we have an Ergo 360 as well. He's still too small for the Ergo, but the Maya wrap has been great for him. We got the Ergo as a gift and I purchased the Maya, both before giving birth so we could practice before he came."
babywearing,2ur5at,BespectacledOwl,1 point,Wed Feb 4 16:12:37 2015 UTC,"I bought a Boba 3G before baby and was gifted a Moby.  Hated the Moby, and purchased a Solly wrap. LOVED it!   Purchased a ring sling (cheap,  Etsy) started using that when my LO was around 7 months.  Recently purchased a Boba Air now that she's older.  If you want to try some items out look up a local baby wearing group! They have awesome lending libraries.  My SO and I use different carriers. He's not into the ring since and the Boba's fit us both comfortably."
babywearing,2ur5at,peaceandkim,1 point,Wed Feb 4 19:30:34 2015 UTC,"2 days before my baby was born we picked up a stretchy wrap like a moby at the last second. I had a scheduled c-section so we knew I wouldn't be able to wear our baby for a while, but still wanted him to have the close bonding with one of us, so my husband wore him in the stretchy wrap when he was 4 days old to when he was 4 months old.   At that point he was much too big for the stretchy wrap and we got a Girasol woven wrap that both of us could use, but I understand it's unusual for both parents to be able to share a wrap.   I recommend getting something to wear your baby in before, that way you can practice with it. Ring slings and stretchy wraps are soooooo good for newborns because they are in and out all the time. The stretchy wrap you can keep on or put it on before you get to where you're going and they're one size so you can share. Same with a ring sling.   If I was going to do it again, I would have a ring sling for a new squish, something that can easily be washed (spit up and poopslosions)."
babywearing,2ur5at,cjbungay,1 point,Wed Feb 4 19:34:49 2015 UTC,"I bought a stretch wrap when my daugther was a week old. Bought a woven wrap when she was 5 weeks old. I got a munchkin slinger which I've been using a lot lately and now at almost 6 months old, I'm going to buy a tula, tried one from a friend. Husband and I use both stretch and woven wrap but the woven one is starting to become to short for him for the fwcc as our daughter has grown a lot."
babywearing,2ur5at,malizathias,1 point,Wed Feb 4 21:58:09 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, you will totally change what you use as baby gets bigger and you get more experience. I loved my moby for the newborn stage. It was also a great tool for learning how to wrap and tighten since you can wrap before putting baby in. I did like my non-stretchy wraps around the house once I got used to wrapping. I have very rarely used them out and about because trying to get baby wrapped and the toddler out and everything just tends to overwhelm me. I've almost always used my ergo for when we are out and about. Right now my 9 month old keeps popping her seat when I try wrapping, so I'm using my ergo all the time. What one person likes, another doesn't and you may like something at first, then not like it later. Luckily most stuff resales well."
babywearing,2ur5at,msuaussiemom,1 point,Wed Feb 4 22:50:04 2015 UTC,I liked my Moby for around the house when he was a newborn. Now we just use the Ergo usually. Both of us can wear it (he actually wears it more than me) and it sizes up and down really easily.
babywearing,2ur5at,lampbowlspoon,1 point,Thu Feb 5 03:03:40 2015 UTC,"See if there is a baby wearing group in your area, you'll be able to try a bunch of different ones"
babywearing,2umztp,am1986,7,Tue Feb 3 14:31:56 2015 UTC,"There is a big learning curve and they are quite a bit different from a stretchy imo.  Most carries aren't pre-tied like a stretchy (though there are some that are like front cross carry).  You have to learn how to tighten and create a seat while supporting your baby.  However, once you master one carry it is easy to learn others.  You get over the learning curve quickly!  I've seen little frog wraps at meetups and they seem like a great option - pretty and supportive but budget-friendly.  My first wrap was a girasol which is similar.  Find one you love in your base size and give it a go!  Go to a meetup if you can, or YouTube is a great place to learn."
babywearing,2umztp,doriangreypants,2,Tue Feb 3 16:17:33 2015 UTC,"Ah thanks for the info,so from what you have said it seems it's more learning the new carries rather than the fabric being difficult to work with.  I looked at the girasols but there didn't seem much difference apart from price,and budget is a big thing for me right now,that's why I'm leaning towards the little frog.Unfortunately baby wearing isn't really a thing where I live so meet ups are hard to find,I get stopped almost every day while wearing him because people want to ask questions!!  Thanks for the response,that's really helped :D"
babywearing,2umztp,doriangreypants,3,Tue Feb 3 16:26:06 2015 UTC,"It's more learning to deal with the woven fabric, plus the new carries.  Woven fabric is less forgiving than stretchy.  It is often bulkier and less flexible.  You have to learn how to work with it since at first it seems much harder than a stretchy (for me anyway).  But while there is a learning curve, it's still easy to learn on your own.  And much more supportive and adaptable than a stretchy.  You will love it!"
babywearing,2umztp,NotQuiteVanilla,2,Tue Feb 3 16:30:51 2015 UTC,This makes all the comments about 'softening' and 'breaking in' make much more sense :D.I primarily use it for school run which is half an hour max so thats probably a good amount of time to get used to it
babywearing,2umztp,mellontree,2,Tue Feb 3 17:01:52 2015 UTC,"Didymos is forgiving and you can find them used. Ellevill is cheaper on their website. I got a new wrap for $60 and all sizes are the same price. Zaras (ellevill) are forgiving and the long tapers make for nice knots. You can use Google to do the money conversion. I wouldn't buy from a US site because they're very marked up. My Zara Sun was very floppy after a wash, dry, and iron. I have a girasol amitola that's also very soft. My didymos tussah silk blend is the easiest to wrap with..  I don't like bamboo because it feels very thick.  I do think linen/cotton breaks in to be soft. Used is a good way to go, but be wary of used wool unless you're sure it isn't felted.   There are lots of used bargains to be had if you're patient. Join a few Facebook groups. Also, birdies room (didymos) was having 30% off in their store and she's awesome for customer service. It's in Canadian dollars so if you're in the US price will be lower.  You can easily use a wrap through preschool AND good ones hold value. I just sold one I bought around 8 years ago for the same price I paid for it. I also used it for 3 years! Didymos will hold value.. girasol can.. oscha seems to fluctuate more depending on the pattern.    I love wraps and baby wearing.  I've promised my DH that I will only trade or sell/buy now. :)"

Budget is tight right now but good point about resale value,that's something to consider when buying one.Im not actually on Facebook but I think I'll ask a friend if I can use hers to browse,I keep hearing great things about Facebook bargains!"
babywearing,2umztp,snickiefritz,5,Thu Feb 5 09:37:53 2015 UTC,"What everyone else has said is correct, but I'd like to add two things: 1. I'd definitely recommend buying a pre loved sling as it will be much softer and easier for a newbie, and 2. Although it's a learning curve with a woven, it's immensely satisfying and enjoyable once you 'get it.' And nothing feels like a well wrapped woven. It's like a constant cuddle round you both."

babywearing,2umztp,pinkpowerranger8,2,Tue Feb 3 22:35:45 2015 UTC,"I definitely second the used carrier suggestion. There are ""babywearing on a budget"" groups on Facebook that are $100 max, including shipping. That being said, I skipped stretchy and started straight into wovens with a new wrap (because I'm picky and didn't find a used one I liked) and I did just fine. I would suggest a 100 % cotton wrap though if you're just starting. I've heard great things about little frog . Check out Lenny lamb too! They have an outlet section that has wraps with small cosmetic flaws at a discount. (barely noticeable and they're perfectly safe)"

babywearing,2u5stx,djensen,1 point,Sat Jan 31 01:53:49 2015 UTC,"I have! I dyed mine luminous turquoise and painted gold mendhi designs on it.   It's fairly easy to do, just make sure you wash it first as on a burg shrinks a lot.  And fold the rails under twice or even three times to avoid fraying."
babywearing,2u5stx,ohnoaduck,1 point,Fri Jan 30 08:49:18 2015 UTC,"I made one. I dyed it purple with a purple ribbon as the middle marker. I did the stitching on one rail with a dark purple thread and the other with a lavender thread so I could tell the rails apart. The ends are angled. I need to redo some of the hems because I didn't realize how much it would fray.   Unfortunately, I've barely used it. My daughter likes her Tula better."
babywearing,2u5stx,greenchipmunk,1 point,Fri Jan 30 14:16:16 2015 UTC,"I made and dyed my own as well. I dyed mine purple and blue, on rail of each color. I was trying to make the dye job as simple as possible so instead of gradient, I just did two buckets and gradually pulled the fabric out of the dye from the center so the ends are darkest. I'm so glad I made my own. I couldn't justify spending hundreds of dollars (and neither could my husband!) I agree with the comment above to angle the ends of your rails. And try to get your hem as small as possible, it's hard on such a long piece of fabric. And definitely put on some type of middle marker. I just used a patch and sewed it on. Good luck!"
babywearing,2u5stx,HoopyGalore,1 point,Fri Jan 30 14:26:52 2015 UTC,I worked on my osnaburg wrap last night. I washed it in hot water twice and put it through a full cycle in the dryer to get it to shrink. It also became much softer. Then I ripped to the width I wanted and hemmed the edges. I decided not to taper the ends. When I went to the fabric store there was 5 7/8 yards left on the bolt so that's all I could get and I want to make sure I have as much length as possible. I bought grey and orange dye to try the ice dye technique this weekend.
babywearing,2u5stx,icharmmi,1 point,Fri Jan 30 14:40:13 2015 UTC,"I made one, never got around to dying it. If I did, I was going to do a galaxy dye. If you haven't hemmed yours yet though, I recommend picking up a rolled hem foot if you're using a machine. Saves you from having to pin all the way around before sewing."
babywearing,2u5stx,momonomicon,1 point,Fri Jan 30 17:38:20 2015 UTC,"I've done 2. I did a long one with turquoise on half and lime green on the other. Then I did a short one with pink, purple, and turquoise. As long as you use fiber reactive dye and batch it long enough the color shouldn't fade. And definitely check out dyed baby carriers group on Facebook."
babywearing,2u4j9o,rocklobstr,3,Thu Jan 29 21:36:10 2015 UTC,"I find that most ringslings or wovens will need some adjustments as you go. I think what is not helping you here is the actual carrier. When you say padded I am assuming you mean the top rail? Is that top rail going under the rings? Also, regards 'froggy' legs it is no longer advised that babies have legs in. Latest advice is legs out, even for small babies as it can be difficult to ensure that their weight is not resting on their ankles."
babywearing,2u4j9o,mellontree,1 point,Fri Jan 30 00:14:33 2015 UTC,"OK on the froggy legs, I always felt like I needed to hold him at the same time because I didn't like that he was on his ankles like that. The sling is padded only on the shoulder part, the whole rest of the sling isn't padded so both rails are just plain material. You know what its like, I have a moby and just like a moby the whole sling just sags after a while under his weight."
babywearing,2u4j9o,mellontree,2,Fri Jan 30 03:33:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not too familiar with Maya - is it woven fabric or SPOC (simple piece of cloth)? Usually, woven fabrics will hold weight a lot better as they are stronger. With you saying part of it is padded I would hazard a guess at cloth. If it is cloth it will sag and the fabric will slip as you're wearing him. it sounds to me like you get him nice and tight to begin with, but then the material sags (which SPOC will do!) And that's why he ends up sideways. The only real remedies are either get a woven rs or keep readjusting.   Edit: I just went and researched and ignore everything I said, Maya is woven. Can you post pictures of how he looks when first in and how looks when the sagging starts please?"
babywearing,2u4j9o,Blablablee,1 point,Fri Jan 30 07:34:26 2015 UTC,Can I jump on this comment and ask if you know how this works with soft structured carriers? I have a 4 month old and a beco soleil and I'm really struggling with his legs- not helped by him wanting to stand up by getting his feet on the waistband...  Eta- he seems to small to have his legs splayed out?
babywearing,2u4j9o,mellontree,2,Fri Jan 30 12:32:37 2015 UTC,"Does the carrier seem too big to be a comfortable seat for him? As in, his legs cant seem to spread wide enough?"
babywearing,2u4j9o,Blablablee,1 point,Fri Jan 30 12:51:19 2015 UTC,"I have him in the newborn insert at the moment, which results in more of what I think is a 'froggy' or m shape, but he keeps getting his feet underneath him. Without the insert he Would be almost doing the splits to have his feet poke out the sides, it's got a wide seat similar to a tula if you are familiar with those? Maybe this It's an awkward size/age for this carrier?   Sorry for the threadjack, the ankle concern is new info for me, but like op I kinda felt that instinctively and haven't been wearing him lately, but I really want to wear him every day ... As soon as it stops being boiling hot here!"
babywearing,2u4j9o,mellontree,2,Fri Jan 30 13:35:54 2015 UTC,"Don't worry! I'm getting that you feel he's not fitting the insert right anymore but he's too little for just the carrier? In that case, you can use a ribbon or a hair tie to cinch in the seat of the carrier and make it narrower for him. Bear in mind, if the fabric goes from knee to knee that's fine and not a concern. At four months he should be ready for knee to knee. If the fabric extends beyind his knees in such a way that it makes his legs straight and not in an M position, then it's too big and I recommend cinching. There are youtube vids that will explain in more detail."

babywearing,2u4j9o,pinkpowerranger8,2,Fri Jan 30 14:31:48 2015 UTC,"I actually have that problem whenever my top rail was too tight. Granted I didn't use a Maya ring sling so I'm not sure if it's the same, but my wcrs that would happen. I would just loosen the top rail a tiny bit and then use the extra tail and roll it and stick it behind her head and neck to give her some padding.  :)"
babywearing,2u4j9o,pinkpowerranger8,1 point,Thu Jan 29 22:35:28 2015 UTC,Ok I can see that this might be my issue. I do tend to probably have it too tight and have to stop myself from doing so. Sometimes I notice the fabric isn't spread throughout the ring all nicely like it was when I put it on and put him in. As if him being in the sling has caused the fabric to bunch up in the ring.
babywearing,2u4j9o,momonomicon,2,Thu Jan 29 22:57:15 2015 UTC,"I have found that if I tighten it by pulling downwards it bunches up even if I make sure it's spread right when I put her in. But I went to a BWI meeting and they showed me that if I put her in it, then put my hand on her back and lean forward, then pull downwards to tighten,  it tends to stay spread a little better.

babywearing,2u3um3,peachy009,4,Thu Jan 29 18:33:34 2015 UTC,"Totally worth it, almost everyone I know has one and loves it. Even people with $300 wraps and Tulas love their infantino mei tai. Your moby will not be comfortable or supportive enough for much longer and the mei tai  is a great choice. Please, however, don't pay full price for it. If you can't find it somewhere on sale and pay $25 or less... Get it used. Babywearing on a Budget group in Facebook always has plenty for a great price and already nicely broken in."
babywearing,2u3um3,MrsWhovian,2,Thu Jan 29 18:42:07 2015 UTC,This exactly.  It is an awesome carrier at a very affordable price.  User friendly and can go from itty bitty to toddler.  Still get my almost three year old in mine.

babywearing,2u3um3,Menelly,1 point,Thu Jan 29 19:06:31 2015 UTC,Works great.  :)  I used a mei tai with my daughter in between the stretchy wrap and SSC days.  Loved it!
babywearing,2u3um3,dutchessgummybunz,1 point,Thu Jan 29 19:15:49 2015 UTC,"I had a Moby from the time my daughter was born until about 4 months when she was around 15lbs. She would sag and it was very uncomfortable on my back.   So I bought the Infantino Mei Tai and let me tell you, it's amazing. It's so easy. Front carries are obviously easiest, but back carries can be just as easy if you find either someone to help you, or a good & safe way to get them on by yourself. It's easy to clean. You just throw it in the washer & dryer with your other laundry. It's comfortable. Even my 6'5"", 300lb SO can comfortably do a front carry in this.   And the price! I got mine on Amazon for $25. You can find them at Wal Mart and Target too for slightly more. You can also buy some fabric markers and color the design to your liking. :D"
babywearing,2u3um3,mogokara,2,Thu Jan 29 20:01:51 2015 UTC,That sounds awesome!  I'm glad to hear everyone has such positive things to say about it! I'm jealous of how cheap you are able to get it. I'm in Canada and haven't seen it for less than $50 new.
babywearing,2u3um3,PreposterousMurmur,1 point,Thu Jan 29 21:10:41 2015 UTC,"I definitely recommend it! I used it every day, many many times a day from about 3 weeks until around 8ish months when I switched over to using the ergo more often. I loved my infantino mei tai- so easy to put on and much cooler (as in, less hot) than anything else I tried. At around 8 months, the ergo became a better choice and was more comfortable on my back, since the baby was getting heavier. But yes, the infantino mei tai is totally worth it."
babywearing,2u3um3,burntorangepeels,1 point,Thu Jan 29 21:26:15 2015 UTC,"We use it with our 16+ lb 10-week-old and love it. He outgrew the Moby really quickly and the mei tai was a great replacement. It distributes his weight well, and we like that the straps mean no buckles to adjust when we switch who's wearing him."
babywearing,2u3um3,cassiland,1 point,Thu Jan 29 23:44:19 2015 UTC,That was my first carrier! For the price you can't go wrong. My daughter and I loved mei tai style carriers till we upgraded to Boba 3G's at a year old.
babywearing,2tv132,babywtfbbq,6,Tue Jan 27 17:47:24 2015 UTC,"Google the name of your city and Babywearing international. Most cities have groups that meet once a month or so. You can try out all different types of carriers, meet other moms, and get hands-on one-on-one advice. I recommend this option because every carrier fits every body differently and it's almost impossible to tell someone what will work for them. At a meeting you will get so much useful info and support, plus people who know everything about the carriers. I can't say enough good things about Babywearing meetings."
babywearing,2tv132,silentcecilia,2,Tue Jan 27 18:33:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Also, join your city's babywearing facebook page. I find the local groups a LOT more helpful than the massive facebook groups."

babywearing,2tv132,kittywig,2,Tue Jan 27 20:42:59 2015 UTC,"Are you considering a wrap? If so, the moby style are supposedly easier to learn with, but a broken in woven wrap (used is almost always better than new!!) isn't that challenging. I have a Didymos Anthracite Ornament wrap that is tussah silk/cotton that I find super easy with my 2wk old.. but so is the Ellevill Zara Sun (Ellevill is the brand, Zara is the style, Sun is the color).. it's 100% cotton so easy to wash/dry/use. I did buy that one new and after a wash/dry/iron it was super soft and easy to tie.  THEN!  Learn ONE... JUST ONE.. Tie.  And it should be the Front Wrap Cross Carry (FWCC). Lots and lots and LOTS of youtube videos out there. ONLY learn that one since it'll take you through the newborn stage.   Be sure your wrap is the right size for you. I'm around a sz 18/20 and I use a size 7 length wrap. Many people have a 6 as their base.   I truly believe a wrap is easier for wearing than a ring sling. The ring slings are easier to get on/adjust, but with the FWCC baby will stay snug against you and you truly feel like your hands are free.   The structured carriers are not as nice for newborns.   thebabywearer.com is a good website that has lots of beginner info as well."

Also got a Bjorn from a neighbor but after a quick google I'm not sure we will be using it. Not really familiar with types of wraps and carriers that exist so it's hard to say what I'm looking for (other than something safe and comfy for both me and baby).

The infantino is good as a backup carrier in my opinion, but the straps are narrow and dig into your shoulders after a while with bigger/heavier kids.

babywearing,2t7qvb,Jennchilada,1 point,Thu Jan 22 07:05:54 2015 UTC,I don't think so. The catbird is better than the infantino in my opinion. You can have a car one and a house one and not blow the bank if you choose to get it.

I think a ring sling is always nice to have around for quick ups, as I find it hard to get my son on my back in the Tula by myself if he's not cooperating. A back carry in a ring sling (once you're familiar and comfortable with it) is a breeze and pretty damn comfy."

babywearing,2t389p,WinstonsMommy,2,Wed Jan 21 02:30:49 2015 UTC,A standard Tula sounds like it would be a good option for you.

babywearing,2t2buv,catsalots,2,Tue Jan 20 16:45:11 2015 UTC,I made my own and it didn't take any sewing. I bought 5 yards of jersey knit fabric and it was wide enough that I cut it in half length wise and ended up with two. I just put a safety pin where the middle was so could find it easily. I meant to sew a pretty piece of fabric but it didn't happen. It worked great when my guy was really small before I started using my SSC.
babywearing,2t2buv,warpweftweave,1 point,Tue Jan 20 16:49:00 2015 UTC,Thanks! I just wasn't sure if they fabric would fray and need to be hemmed along the sides. I know nothing about sewing.
babywearing,2t2buv,warpweftweave,2,Tue Jan 20 16:51:26 2015 UTC,The knit fabric doesn't fray. I'm sure you could hem it to make it look prettier but I wasn't too worried about it.
babywearing,2t2buv,donnamatrix79,2,Tue Jan 20 17:54:38 2015 UTC,Anything knit/stretchy won't fray (but will curl a bit -- couldn't care less!)   I found this:  http://www.rookiemoms.com/how-to-make-a-moby-wrap/  Has instructions (such as they are) for both stretchy and not.   Be warned: it's remarkably difficult to cut 5 yards of fabric in a straight line. I didn't care about that either. :)

babywearing,2t1a42,fancypig,2,Tue Jan 20 18:56:37 2015 UTC,"What mei tai are you using? At that weight it would need to have thicker padded straps to be comfortable, even when baby is high and tight. Try a back carry with your ergo and see how that feels."

babywearing,2sq8wd,iliketoasttoo,1 point,Sat Jan 17 15:26:29 2015 UTC,The latest recommendations are to wait on using a SSC until baby can sit unassisted because they do not adequately support the natural curvature of the newborn spine.
babywearing,2sq8wd,gwenami,1 point,Sat Jan 17 21:03:27 2015 UTC,I think it may depend on the type of SSC- mei tais are very supportive of little backs' curves if you tie them correctly with under leg passes or tie under their bum (and not knot it directly behind baby's back). Especially with mei tais that have wrap straps instead of narrow straps.
babywearing,2sq8wd,msuaussiemom,1 point,Sun Jan 18 05:52:53 2015 UTC,I haven't seen this. Where did you see that information? I know you aren't supposed to put them on your back until they can sit unassisted in a ssc.

Some websites list ring slings under $100, like 5mr.com, and the Babywearing on a Budget or the Babywearing Swap will be great places to look for one that is already soft and broken-in.

They also can easily hold a newborn in the upright position, and support the natural curve of a baby's back while holding them right to you and high on your chest. (FYI, babies should never recline in a cradle position in any carrier) Unpadded ring slings tend to be easier to adjust and use for newborns, and present less risk for fabric or padding to bunch around their face. :)"

babywearing,2snk7s,duck_duck_rabbit,1 point,Sat Jan 17 02:27:52 2015 UTC,It preserves the peace! Plus what are you going to do in the middle of target when you're wearing the baby and have nowhere to put her and you gotta go??
babywearing,2snk7s,burntorangepeels,1 point,Sat Jan 17 01:00:05 2015 UTC,That's exactly what happened to us! In the Mai tie! All was fine until I had to button my pants back up and adjust him without waking him.

Google your city with Babywearing international and you should find something. Front wrap cross carry is definitely a good place to start. Have fun!

babywearing,2sktut,pinkpowerranger8,2,Fri Jan 16 01:11:53 2015 UTC,Oh congrats! I got a didymos lisca minos in a 6. I hope I can get the hang of it enough to use it in the first weeks :)

babywearing,2sktut,spaceheater,2,Fri Jan 16 03:47:15 2015 UTC,"A no sew ring sling with a folded wrap seems like it would be a nightmare to adjust. There are some ways to finish longer carries with rings but I've never tried it. I bet if you Google woven wrap ring finish carries, you'll find a ton of videos."

babywearing,2sjs1v,awholelotofbuns,5,Thu Jan 15 20:05:06 2015 UTC,"If you want the option of having baby face out, look into the Ergo 360. If not, I love Tulas. Ring slings are by far my favorite carriers but you can't back carry in them."
babywearing,2sjs1v,that_girl13,1 point,Thu Jan 15 20:37:48 2015 UTC,"+1 for the Ergo. Tulas are great, my wife has one, but I like the wider range of options and size of the Ergo."
babywearing,2sjs1v,skaschmidt,4,Thu Jan 15 23:56:14 2015 UTC,"If you have issues with neck injuries I might suggest staying away from the ring sling. I love them for small babies, but especially with larger babies they start to put a lot of pressure. You can back carry in a ring sling, but I only feel comfortable doing so for a short period of time. Even without neck/shoulder injuries. We have a Tula and really love it. The padding in the straps is much more substantial than most other carriers and especially compared to a bjorn, it's easily adjusted to get comfy."
babywearing,2sjs1v,pinkpowerranger8,4,Thu Jan 15 21:11:54 2015 UTC,I have a lillebaby and I love it! It can do a front forward carry. We just tried the back carry the other day and it worked great. It's really comfortable! I use it every day!
babywearing,2sjs1v,warpweftweave,5,Thu Jan 15 22:13:37 2015 UTC,I love my Tula! I would recommend a standard size. The toddler sizes are really big and won't begin to work until your baby fits 2T pants.
babywearing,2sjs1v,CGNU,2,Thu Jan 15 22:14:22 2015 UTC,"Tula! I love mine, I use it on my 9 month old all the time. We also have a toddler tula that we used on my older daughter up until she was 3."
babywearing,2sjs1v,PhotoBerger,1 point,Fri Jan 16 05:18:24 2015 UTC,You're on the right track in brands. Just make sure it's approved for toddler and preschool children's weight. My husband and I both have Boba 3G's and love them. I got them for a steal a year and a half ago and haven't gotten tired of them yet. A mom that I know from our library story time group just got a brand new Tula on Ebay for ~60$ USD and is raving about it for her 16 month old daughter. No matter which brand you pick make sure it's a soft structure carrier and can carry up to around 40lbs.
babywearing,2sjs1v,PreposterousMurmur,1 point,Thu Jan 15 20:41:26 2015 UTC,A tula or ergo for sure. Ring slings are great but better suited to bubs under a year in my opinion
babywearing,2sjs1v,beanbaconsoup,1 point,Thu Jan 15 22:27:10 2015 UTC,"I got a Boba Air when my daughter turned one and I LOVE it because it's so compact that I can bring it every where.   I have my eye on a Tula, but kind of want to get the bigger one so I still have time for that!   My 16 month old is not 20 pounds yet but we can do the back carry in the Boba Air and she loves is. (Front carry too when she's sleepy!)"
babywearing,2sjs1v,peaceandkim,1 point,Fri Jan 16 05:21:32 2015 UTC,"Ergo, Tula or Kinderpack!"
babywearing,2sjs1v,shadeofmyheart,1 point,Fri Jan 16 13:24:01 2015 UTC,"I have a tula, ergo, ring sling and wrap. Dd loves wraps for back carries and for some reason hates the ergo or tula for back carries. She's not too much of a fan of front carries for long periods of time. I'm considering an ergo 360 because of the forward facing option and she loves to observe so I think she will enjoy it a bit longer! Our girl is super busy, so it may be necessary! Every child is different but here are my thoughts!   Tula: easiest to adjust, and the back panel goes up higher than the ergo, some say they find it nicer on the back because it's more padded. I personally don't find a huge difference if they're both broken in nicely.   Ergo: can side carry which dd loves! The extra straps make it a little confusing, but allow for more adjustment/carries than the tula.   Ring sling: super easy to get kiddo in or out, can also side carry. Not comfy for long periods. Back carry is possible, but not really recommended.   Wrap: takes practice with all the different types of carries and getting used to. Super comfy and cuddly, and so many different options."
babywearing,2sh2h2,SouthMountainMods,1 point,Thu Jan 15 02:39:40 2015 UTC,Beautiful! I love the look of handwovens.
babywearing,2s96z4,Fibonacci_Sequence,5,Tue Jan 13 06:08:52 2015 UTC,"you shouldnt have to worry too much. so long as babies face isnt covered up by anything, or feeling too hot, you should be golden. besides the point, if its only around the house, you and her are not wearing heavy clothing, you can easily keep an eye on her at all times. i doubt there will be any safety issues at this point. correct me if im wrong reddit."
babywearing,2s96z4,doctorxdestructo,3,Tue Jan 13 12:23:12 2015 UTC,I don't think there are age restrictions. As long as her head is supports and breathing/airway is maintained you are fine. you can froggy in a ring sling as well.
babywearing,2s96z4,Meilikah,3,Tue Jan 13 13:21:13 2015 UTC,"I started using a ring sling with my daughter around 2 weeks old, but I didn't get super comfortable with it until she had more head control around 8-10 weeks."
babywearing,2s96z4,catchatorie,3,Tue Jan 13 16:10:25 2015 UTC,"Slings with padded rails are typically easier with bigger babies, used in a hip carry.  Do the rails adjust independently?  This makes it easier to use with a smaller child, but it might still be a bit tricky, depending on how long the padding is- it might not easily adjust small enough for a new baby.  Fabric ringslings, without padding, can be used from birth, but this one might be better from about 5-6 months.  I think that for $15 it's still a good buy.  You might just need to hang onto it for a few months."

babywearing,2s46iq,ching_chong_peruna,18,Mon Jan 12 01:06:26 2015 UTC,It's the same thing with cloth diapers. Single diapers selling for a couple hundred dollars. I think humans just like to collect things.
babywearing,2s46iq,yellowtreesinautumn,6,Mon Jan 12 01:31:46 2015 UTC,"Wow I was going to mention the waste of money on something bound to get baby leakage on the wrap, but on a diaper it's not accidental leakage it's the main function."
babywearing,2s46iq,OrganizedSprinkles,4,Mon Jan 12 01:39:36 2015 UTC,Single diapers selling for a couple hundred dollars.   No...for real? Is it a discontinued/limited edition print thing with those too?
babywearing,2s46iq,morelove,6,Mon Jan 12 01:41:06 2015 UTC,"yup!  its...  weird.  like one goodmama that i know of went for $1400.  think about it.  a cloth shit catcher....  $1400.  and as far as i know,  its never going on a kids butt.  ever."
babywearing,2s46iq,Soxbee,3,Mon Jan 12 04:00:09 2015 UTC,My god. 1400? On a diaper? I don't understand that either. I have a lot Of cloth diapers but I always told myself I wouldn't cloth diaper to collect them and the prices on new prints retail is enough to deter me from that. Bought all of mine second hand and very happy I did.
babywearing,2s46iq,morelove,2,Mon Jan 12 04:51:47 2015 UTC,"i bought new for this babe.  only cuz a $300 package was om for $150.  heeck yes!  i don't get it either,  i bought one new goodmama,  it was stollen from me i think.  it was a good diaper but not $1400 good."
babywearing,2s46iq,OOmama,4,Mon Jan 12 05:38:24 2015 UTC,Yep. There's raffles for the chance to buy them too. It's insane. One of the reasons we cloth diaper is to save money. Spending $200  & up on a freaking diaper makes no sense to me.
babywearing,2s46iq,elbowcaterpillar,3,Mon Jan 12 03:09:44 2015 UTC,Yup.  If you look up the Jules print by BumGenius (especially the unopened ones) on eBay you can see the craziness.

I don't really care what other people spend their money on. Some women collect Louboutins or Fendi bags or whatever, some women collect fancy woven wraps. There are also plenty of pretty, affordable woven wraps and carriers out there too. Check out Babywearing on a Budget. Everything is $100 or less. That's where I shop :)"
babywearing,2s46iq,silentcecilia,11,Mon Jan 12 01:12:42 2015 UTC,"Oh, I feel similarly...if someone's into collecting these things that's cool. I was just surprised because I always thought of babywearing as more of a utilitarian thing and not an...expensive hobby? I could understand if someone shells out for a nice Girasol or whatever (I did!), but I can't relate to the idea of spending a fortune on collecting them just to have them or because they're limited edition or whatnot.  Edit: Oh, and thanks for the tip on Babywearing on a Budget, I switched to that group instead :)"

However, I think the people who do what you're talking about think of it like any other semi-useful collection. Shoes & purses can get like that - sure we all need shoes but does anyone actually need Prada shoes? No, but they're beautiful and if you have the money, why not?"
babywearing,2s46iq,dddash,7,Mon Jan 12 03:16:41 2015 UTC,"Some people like to spend a lot of money on purses or shoes, I like to spend money on woven wraps and wrap conversion Tulas. I don't see a problem with it - different strokes for different folks. There are plenty of deals to be had on the Swap. As far as the prices of WC Tulas - whenever you have a small production quantity and a huge demand, market value will be high. It's been correcting over the last year or so; you can find a LOT of WCs on the Tula BST for retail these days."

No, it's not a problem, I was really just trying to understand the motives of something that was so unfamiliar and surprising to me. Do you use all the wraps and Tulas you buy, or are there some you get just to hold on to and barter with? I think it's fascinating that any object will gain value from use -- this is just so opposite from what I'm used to seeing."
babywearing,2s46iq,Kappa_the_imp,2,Mon Jan 12 11:16:47 2015 UTC,"I use all of the wraps and Tulas -- and I lend them out to spread the babywearing love.   I have 6 Tulas [3 WC, 3 Canvas] and all but two are currently loaned out. I also have 2 wovens, a moby, and three ring slings -- all but one woven are loaned out as well.  It makes sense to me that if they are well-kept they would increase in value. My favorites are the ones that are worn in and floppy. New wraps and Tulas are super stiff - so paying a little extra to not have to break it in works for me. However, I'm not in it it make money. If I can break even or even if I lose a bit, no biggie. I paid market value for all of my WCs and if market value goes down, so be it."
babywearing,2s46iq,Soxbee,3,Tue Jan 13 20:43:00 2015 UTC,"Ditto.  Though I'm only keeping 2 Tulas.. One special one for me and one the rest of the family quite likes. Mine is a wc and theirs is canvas.   I bought nativity kraken for my artistic pirate loving daughter to use with her newest baby brother and to keep for her babies or just as a great blanket wrap.   For myself I have a mix of wrap sizes,  colors,  and fabrics.  We have 4 baby wearing folks in my home and baby wearing is a major part of our lifestyle in,  around,  and outside of the home.  It's not just something for going to the store.   I recently resold a didymos Indio I bought in 2007 for exactly the same price I paid.  Some wraps I've gotten under retail.. Or just market.  The Tulas I bought at retail and also sold one (selling another now)  that funded the gira I wanted.    For us these are tools,  but lovely ones.  I like wool,  silk,  hemp etc for their different qualities... And we don't even own a stroller."
babywearing,2s46iq,NotQuiteVanilla,2,Mon Jan 12 13:34:11 2015 UTC,"My wife is one that likes to have new wraps and different sizes. It's a combination of a few factors that make moms (usually) want to ""collect"" them.   Size- different sizes can be used for different kinds of wraps Fabric- Some are made out of wool, some are made out other materials. Getting one for multiple seasons makes sense I guess...or they just like the feel. Pattern- this is probably the biggest reason people collect wraps is the search for the perfect pattern that sums up why they had the baby in the first place.   Me? I don't mind wraps, I get it, and wrap on occasion but I don't really care what it looks like. I'm a fan of the ergo personally."
babywearing,2s46iq,Soxbee,7,Mon Jan 12 12:23:40 2015 UTC,"I have a single size 7 woven that I paid around $120 for, one cheap ass infantino mei tai, and had a cheap ring sling that got away from me. Not everybody is rocking discontinued collectible didymus whatevers. Like every ... Hobby? You're going to have groups of people here and there that have the money to really go off the wall with it.   Edit: And if you want to really REALLY dig deep, there may very well be some socioeconomic disparities with baby wearing.

babywearing,2s46iq,rocket_bag,3,Mon Jan 12 01:40:20 2015 UTC,"Everything goes this hardcore! It's just that Babywearing is still kind of niche in most places, so you find the hardcore pretty easily. And the fact that a lot of wraps are handwoven can drive up the price. It's no longer just a baby carrier, it's art."

babywearing,2s46iq,sellyberry,2,Mon Jan 12 11:17:56 2015 UTC,"I read there have been a few duo groups where someone collected all the money for a dip (in one case a tula in another case a limited edition bumgenious print) and never awarded the price, just pocketed the money.   To be fair, I've read about it happening in co-ops too. I belong to several of those and love them, but I've read up on which to stay away from. With anything there is good and bad and by no means am I saying every dip group is shady. ""Dipping"" doesn't really make sense to me and I see it as a waste of time/money/hope of winning said ""pride"""
babywearing,2s46iq,NerdtasticHG,1 point,Mon Jan 12 11:27:57 2015 UTC,"I think people need to be careful about where they put their money.

I have a couple of wraps that I have sewn and dyed myself, a ring slim also sewn myself, and a very cheap infantino Mai tei that I customized with slip covers. All in all, I have spent very little money."
babywearing,2s46iq,shadeofmyheart,2,Mon Jan 12 02:32:42 2015 UTC,"While I certainly don't have as much invested in my wraps as others in my local babywearing group, I could give you my take.  This little microeconomy is all fascinating, and indeed when I first investigated, I thought all these chicks were insane, (and they are).  But I appreciate it with a little more understanding now.  There is an expectation that the money you have invested in a higher end woven wrap (or conversion) is able to be recouped when you resell it.  Often, wraps (even in used condition) resell for TRIPLE their retail value.  There are a fair amount of people in the community who buy at retail just to turn it around for a profit.  But those stacks of wraps and conversions that people show off arent ever bought with the intention of hanging onto them forever.  If anything, they might be seen as an investment.  Most of my friends have an ever changing stash, as they buy one and sell another week to week.    You mentioned a cotton wrap going for $500, and you might have seen that there are other more luxury materials used in some brands that drive the price up too.  For all wraps whose market value are several hundred bucks, its all about the exclusivity.  Wraps are released in limited numbers for each size.  They might even retail at $700, but they sell out in seconds because so few (sometimes less than ten) are sold, and often not released again.    There is also so much trade going on with these, that it is possible to start out with a modestly priced wrap and continually trade up until you've got yourself a Pamir.  But there is something very communal and connected about the swapping aspect of these groups, and it takes a certain trust that has been somewhat lost in your typical modern day transaction.  It's kinda cool.    The influence people have on each other when they are involved in such communities is pretty enabling, what with the gushing and competitiveness to score wraps, meanwhile kinda being able to say that they are buying these ""for the baby"" ... a mindset can change when surrounded by others whose norm is to sink tons of money into their stash.  I have a friend who started with Pavos and Oschas and has graduated to handwovens and AP.  She snatched up 2 of 8 HWs from a release, spending somewhere around $2k.  I couldnt believe it.  But... maybe she's the smart one because market value on ONE of them just went for $3k."
babywearing,2s46iq,MustacheBus,2,Mon Jan 12 05:58:32 2015 UTC,"It does seem crazy that people can come up with the money- but I do love pretty wraps. I can't buy more than a couple and spend more than 150, but I got my ""cheaper"" wraps off that fb swap too and they are beautiful to me"
babywearing,2s46iq,keely11,2,Mon Jan 12 12:24:50 2015 UTC,Hand woven wraps are expensive due to the cost of hand weaving. Baby wraps are actually on the lower end of the cost spectrum as far as hand woven items go. The wraps that are machine woven and sold by the hundred for the same prices as hand wovens are jacked up due to brand names.   My wife and I make wraps but cannot afford our own products. We simply sell where the market will allow us to.
babywearing,2s46iq,Icy_candy,2,Mon Jan 12 16:02:26 2015 UTC,"I boggle at this, too. I have a used didymos, a ring sling, a boba 3g, and I used to have a moby, but then i sold it. I honestly wish I hadn't spent as much as I did on babywearing, because at a year, my daughter is mostly over it (and went through a long period of time where she hated being worn when she was younger, too!) I bought the didy in part because I told people she didn't like being worn and they told me the solution was buying a wrap. Well, nope.  Part of me wishes I'd gotten a prettier SSC, but that's mostly vanity. Were I to do it again, I'd use the ring sling with a newborn and maybe a Tula and would have never bothered with the wraps."
babywearing,2s5y7k,Icy_candy,1 point,Mon Jan 12 14:05:45 2015 UTC,"I have a linen sling. Is yours new? Over usage it will become less stiff. Mine did.   Other than that, the softest material is going to be cotton, but it is also the least strong. Silk is more smooth than soft in my opinion, but that only comes from handling fabric, not necessarily already made slings, so I might be incorrect about how they will feel"
babywearing,2s5y7k,momonomicon,1 point,Mon Jan 12 14:38:01 2015 UTC,I have a cotton silk blend and it was really stiff when I first got it. I spent time breaking it in and it's gotten softer (I wouldn't describe it as soft but it's not rough or uncomfortable). I know linens are supposed to be lighter and more breathable for hot weather. I think cotton is your best bet for softness.

babywearing,2ri5cn,andriellae,2,Tue Jan 6 10:52:35 2015 UTC,"I still wrap my one year old for naps. I find that front cross carry (as opposed to front wrap cross carry) is the most comfortable for his legs during a nap. He is able to have slightly more give as to which way he wants to move them. That being said, I make sure to wrap him  and do my normal sway, butt pat, sing, etc routine and when he's almost ready to fall asleep, I sit in a recliner, glider or on the bed with pillows propped up behind me.   I find that he is okay with sleeping with me sitting, only if he fell asleep like that. If I sit once he's completely fallen asleep, he will absolutely wake up. A little recline, as opposed to sitting straight up, also leaves more room for his legs. In FCC, I just shift him a little bit towards one hip or the other and he straddles my torso, still in his ""m"" position in quite happily for the whole nap. Hope some of that helps!"
babywearing,2ri5cn,MrsWhovian,1 point,Tue Jan 6 14:26:16 2015 UTC,My baby was the same around that age. Have you tried softly bouncing on an exercise ball while wrapping him? At least you don't have to be on your feet.

In general, they are hard to come by. New regulations make it impossible for small businesses to dabble in babywearing creations and so a lot of converters have gone out of business in the last year. Using a tablecloth and making one yourself is an option if you are confident with your sewing skills. Just make sure you research a lot before you start so you can be sure it is safe for your baby to go in."

Smaller or premature babies can be more prone to irregular breathing or positional asphyxiation, so it's a good idea to check with your GP or midwife before wearing tiny babies. If they ok it, make sure to position properly (high on chest, kissable, face completely visible and uncovered), and check on baby every few minutes. Congrats on your new wee one. Happy Babywearing!"

Typically, small term babies are fine in carriers while still under the weight limit, but the limits are there to protect the manufacturer.  If a baby is prem, he/she should not be put into a soft structured carrier while still below the weight restriction."

A carrier that fits one person perfectly could rub and chafe on someone else, so if it's possible for you to try them both on I highly recommend it!

babywearing,2qulzs,Sinafey,2,Tue Dec 30 23:00:56 2014 UTC,"I've had both.   I got the pikkolo first but ended up returning it. My first impression was that the buckles on the waist belt seemed backwards (don't really know how to explain that.) I've had an ergo for a long time and I'm used to that. Then I wasn't really in love with the body of it, and just wasn't 100% in love with the way it felt on. Nothing too major and it could just be all personal preference. I know some people absolutely love their Pikkolo.   The very next day I went and tried on a standard Tula and fell in love instantly. So. Much. Comfort. There's more padding around a Tula than any other SSC. The body is also bigger so I feel like it's going to support my girl for a lot longer. Whereas the Pikkolo seems to work better for smaller babies or at least while they're younger.   I love SSCs and my favorites are by far the Tula and Ergo."
babywearing,2qulzs,Axora,2,Tue Dec 30 21:30:25 2014 UTC,Thanks for your input. I do like the sound of a larger body.
babywearing,2qulzs,fancypig,2,Tue Dec 30 21:51:32 2014 UTC,"The Pikkolo is designed to be a mei tai/ SSC hybrid. The straps and waist are less padded and the waist is worn apron style like a mei tai, but everything buckles like a SSC. When baby is older and heavier you can add the support waist.  How old is your LO? The Pikkolo is a smaller bodied carrier, great for little babies because it is adjustable. The Tula won't fit baby without an insert until closer to six months but will last through toddlerhood."
babywearing,2qulzs,Fibonacci_Sequence,2,Tue Dec 30 21:39:05 2014 UTC,"She's a little over 4 months old, and just shy of 7kg in weight. Ideally I'd be able to use the carrier as long as I can. Sounds like the Tula would last longer for us."

Then there are plain fabric slings that are pretty varied. My favorite sling maker is Sleeping Baby Productions. She's quite busy these days so her shop may not be open but do check out her info, it's great. If you see you can easily make your own. SBP has info on that too. For any along you buy or make, be sure to use Sling Ring brand rings. Craft or tack rings aren't safe for babywearing."

I too have become one of those tula moms ;) It started with me saying I could get a used ergo, and then talked myself into a spotted love. (I did do a lot of research tho and bought it on sale) I swore I was happy with a canvas and there weren't many wc I liked. But then I decided let's try a stocking for Xmas. And omg I scored! A full standard girasol. So now I have a canvas and a wc and I talking to my husband about building me tula hooks.   Enjoy your Tulas!"

babywearing,2qlpdc,cassiland,1 point,Fri Jan 2 08:29:09 2015 UTC,"Wearing it around your shoulder will help distribute the weight. You'll lose some mobility in that arm, but it carries way better and won't make your shoulder hurt or give you ""the lean""."

babywearing,2q7z1e,catchatorie,7,Wed Dec 24 01:48:24 2014 UTC,Your MIL was overreacting and being a bitch for trying to guilt trip you about wearing your baby. You might want to send her some resources about the benefits of babywearing.
babywearing,2q7z1e,SugarandSass,3,Wed Dec 24 12:52:24 2014 UTC,"The holidays are a great time for family to gather round and tell you how you're ruining your babies' lives!  My GMIL told me yesterday that cosleeping is illegal here (Virginia). I asked her about it and she said a woman was prosecuted for the accidental suffocation of her baby. Therefore cosleeping is illegal? Because cosleeping automatically means they'll suffocate and die? Hmm...  She also insists that the baby must be cold if she's not wearing socks, pants, long sleeves, or a hat. Any visible skin means she's cold, and will get sick."

Just make sure her legs don't turn purple or blue  I found that if I tightened the bum and loosened the legs, my baby still felt supported but didn't have any marks. It takes some getting used to, and the sling could probably use some breaking in if you can't figure it out. Don't worry,  though!"

Ended up getting Cloudy for less than retail (still BNIB) and the accessories were new and around $6 less than I would have paid from the shop.    Now I need to stop looking at the swaps because I'll be too tempted if the mermaids come up again!!!   Our stash is the tula, Oscha caledonia cardamom, amethyst didymos (linen/cotton, well broken in), Ellevill Linus bought during their major sale, an ellaroo (shorter), and will be selling the long cranberry indio didymos.  The Oscha was only available in Australia, so I had it sent to my British relatives to send to me in the US!

I do not plan on having more than two Tulas.. because, seriously.. :D Can I also say it's because I have 4+ babywearers in my home??     My back-to-work plan includes working on weekends and taking a sibling (or husband) along with me. They're likely to wander the area that day (it's a huge touristy, walking friendly area) so the carriers are way nicer than a stroller.

babywearing,2pn3qm,shadeofmyheart,1 point,Thu Dec 18 02:49:53 2014 UTC,Thank you so much. Sounds scary. This site doesn't allow for anonymity (I can see her fb) and she said she adored it with her daughter but I shouldn't be too trusting. Trying to save money but maybe I should go new with this one.
babywearing,2pn3qm,5six7eight,1 point,Thu Dec 18 03:10:40 2014 UTC,"Ask her where she bought it, then check the list of authorized reatilerz on the Ergo site. I really don't think that most people have/sell fakes on purpose, they just see a good deal on Amazon and pick it up.  Amazon is an authorized retailer, but it's so easy to get confused by the third party retailers that you can also buy from there.  If she says Amazon I'd pass."
babywearing,2pn3qm,pinkpowerranger8,2,Thu Dec 18 13:49:28 2014 UTC,"I know that you can send pictures to ergo and they can tell you whether it is authentic or not,  but aside from that I don't know that there's a way. A lot of people used to say a certain buckle or label gave it away but the fergos have gotten really good!"
babywearing,2pn3qm,MustacheBus,2,Thu Dec 18 08:43:32 2014 UTC,I believe Ergo has stopped authenticating their products. At least that was the last I heard a few months back on some Babywearing groups. I think they said unless you buy from one of their retailers there is no way to confirm if it is a fake.
babywearing,2pn3qm,prinzessbohnen,2,Thu Dec 18 13:36:22 2014 UTC,I would buy a new one. I got a used one from a friend and some of the straps were hard to tighten and twisted easily when tightening since they were so worn. I got a super deal from Amazon for a Ergo performance- almost half price! I would check their daily christmas deals and the warehouse too.   If you are still interested in the used one though I would ask for some current pictures of it. We almost bought a used ikea crib based on some stock photos and when I asked for current pictures it was a completely different ikea crib than the stock photo.

babywearing,2p3j9f,Sbzitz,1 point,Fri Dec 12 23:18:40 2014 UTC,A hanging shoe rack like this one would be cool. That way she could roll up the wraps and put them in there so they don't drag on the ground from a hook.

It's so incredibly frustrating though because I'd love to wear her and all I find online is ""Babies LOVE to be worn!"".    It would be incredible to be able to go grocery shopping with her (impossible with her car seat).  We also have 2 air travel trips planned in the next couple months and I was really hoping to be able to wear her on the plane-- for everyone's benefit!"

babywearing,2p186v,I_pet_pigs,2,Fri Dec 12 15:57:30 2014 UTC,"Thanks. That's encouraging.  She loves looking out from a lap or being held football-style so she can look around.

babywearing,2p186v,seabirdsong,1 point,Sat Dec 13 02:01:40 2014 UTC,This is exactly my thought. Both my sons hated carriers where they faced in until they were big enough to have their head entirely out so they could look around.

She in no way will let me wrap her up in it before-hand so I end up stuffing the insert into the carrier first and then sliding her in and shimmying her into place while wearing.  She really just hates having her legs restricted, I think.  She's always been a kicker and very strong willed."

So I'm on the lookout for some babysafe accessories to put on my wishlist :)
babywearing,2p0zqv,higginsnburke,2,Fri Dec 12 00:11:08 2014 UTC,"If you decide to get an ergo, you should know they don't hold value well so they're usually easier to find at a great discount on the swap boards or ebay!   What about a ring sling? You can find them in gorgeous colors and weaves.. you may need something else when your baby is older, but I've worn a toddler on my back in a maya wrap ring sling and hiked through the mountains of WV.  I do prefer long wraps for longer wearing now.. and there are a gazillion ways to wrap that don't have to involve your back.  All SSC (like ergo, tula, etc) will go around your waist and settle weight there. The long wraps provide the most options.. and the ring sling just uses your shoulder.   The maya wrap ring slings are also out of wonderful woven fabric that breathes nicely. It has a long tail that you can also use as a breastfeeding cover if desired."
babywearing,2p0zqv,NotQuiteVanilla,2,Fri Dec 19 19:30:17 2014 UTC,So sorry about your back injury. The only suggestion I have for you is to check out and pick from these range of best baby carriers as discussed on this website. http://bestratedbabycarriers.com/top-5-baby-carriers/ Hope they all come out handy. Thanks
babywearing,2p0zqv,vickyrichy,1 point,Thu Dec 18 09:10:36 2014 UTC,I have heard Mei Tai carriers or the Ergo are good for people with back problems. That is what my research has pointed to. Ergos are MUCH more expensive than Mei Tais and if you plan on wearing when they are little you will need the infant insert but they have a strap that helps with lower back support and transfers the weight from your shoulders to your hips. Depending on how good you get at tying them woven wraps can actually be really good for lower back support but they CAN have a steep learning curve.
babywearing,2p0zqv,Arielyssa,1 point,Wed Dec 17 00:01:58 2014 UTC,"I was originally looking at an Ergo, but have heard that Tulas are better on your back. I don't own either yet, but have posted here and done a ton of research online."
babywearing,2p0n3a,doobiekiller,1 point,Thu Dec 11 22:23:46 2014 UTC,"I've been looking at something like this for front carry: http://www.amazon.com/Infantino-Hoodie-Universal-Season-Carrier/dp/B005C9ODUW/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1419831136&sr=8-9&keywords=babywearing  Im not sure how it would work with a back, but something along those lines might work!"
babywearing,2p0n3a,mreneeco,0,Mon Dec 29 05:33:10 2014 UTC,"The other option is just to dress your baby warmly. I put my baby in a polar fleece suit before wrapping her.  Granted, it doesn't get super cold here, but she was happy."
babywearing,2p0n3a,merveilleuse_,1 point,Thu Dec 11 23:14:02 2014 UTC,"we tend to dress him warmly, but here in northern illinois it gets pretty cold and windy. We had a lot of days -10 or below last winter. When it gets that cold, the only way to dress him is in a heavy puffy snowsuit. All the reading I have done says that it's best not to wrap a puffily dressed baby."
babywearing,2oulnn,babyblue617,5,Wed Dec 10 09:07:16 2014 UTC,"A woven wrap will fit everyone, adult and child."
babywearing,2oulnn,mellontree,4,Wed Dec 10 09:11:46 2014 UTC,"Ergo or tula. Can be used from birth (with newborn insert or a rolled up blanket under bum) up to 4 years. They also fit most people. If you're bigger, ergo do an extension belt.  Our 2.5yo still comfortably sits in the Ergo but we just got him a toddler tula (slightly bigger than baby tula so even more support and weight distribution, can be used from 18 months) so we can use the Ergo with our second baby. They are both such supportive carriers I can still front carry my toddler for a couple of hours without issues despite having some back problems (most people wouldn't front carry with other carriers or wraps past about 9 months).  Plus, both brands have great reseale value.  If you google carrier comparison chart you should be able to find a chart that has the measurements of the most popular carriers and their pros and cons. It should be one of the first search results."
babywearing,2oulnn,bambiontheshore,2,Wed Dec 10 17:38:50 2014 UTC,"I just got myself an Ergo with the infant insert. It was a toss up between that and the Tula, and I ended up with the Ergo because I had a buybuybaby gift card. It's nice to know it's still useful for a while, and I'll probably end up asking for a toddler Tula a year or two down the line!  Edit to add, for OP: I really like the Ergo. It's pretty easily adjustable so my husband and I can both wear it (it looks like you can just tighten or loosen the straps) and it's a sturdy but soft canvas. I previously had a Beco Gemini, but I returned it because it was uncomfortably stiff and LO hated it. Plus, the buckles on it needed two hands to undo, which is good for safety but how am I supposed to keep a hand on LO while removing the carrier if I need both hands to undo the buckle? So far (having owned it for all of a day) I really like the Ergo."
babywearing,2oulnn,greenbeantime,2,Wed Dec 10 21:50:52 2014 UTC,"Well that takes the beco out of the running! I've been trying to decide between ergo, Tula and beco."
babywearing,2oulnn,chotay29,1 point,Mon Dec 22 15:21:22 2014 UTC,"I think if they sold them at buy buy baby where I had my gift card, I'd have chosen the tula. They get rave reviews! I ""settled"" on the ergo because I had the gift card but I think I'd have preferred the tula.   Do you have a baby wearing group nearby? Mine has a lending library, and if yours does it might be nice to try before you buy?"
babywearing,2oulnn,greenbeantime,3,Mon Dec 22 17:13:28 2014 UTC,"We have a ringsling, a boba and two wovens. All are one size fits all. The boba extends up to like 58"". All are awesome"
babywearing,2oulnn,strawberrycc,1 point,Wed Dec 10 19:27:27 2014 UTC,My girlfriend had a boba 3g and it was noticeably less padded in the straps than my ergo or toddler tula. Just a heads up for those wanting to carry into toddlerhood or for very long periods of time. But I loved that it had loops to hold a bag/backpack on your shoulder and the stirrups to keep feet from dangling too much. I with other brands had those features.
babywearing,2oulnn,bambiontheshore,1 point,Thu Dec 11 20:07:11 2014 UTC,I've worn mine for hours on end and it's never been uncomfortable. The panel is slightly taller than on ergos and it's more short people friendly. Boba also has amazing customer service. My chest clip slid off the piping and they immediately sent me a label and replaced it with a 4G without even asking when I bought it
babywearing,2oulnn,strawberrycc,1 point,Fri Dec 12 00:37:17 2014 UTC,"Ah yes but wait until you get to well over two years :p you might not even notice the difference until you try something else. I had a Bondolino and thought it was amazing until I tried the Ergo. There is more padding but not everyone will necessarily need it, it's still good to know if you're planning on using it the full 4 years. But I agree, the panel being taller is great especially if you have a kid that leans back a lot (Ergo does a ""sports"" model or something that has a higher back too I think). And my gf's hip buckle broke a few times and she got new ones within two days of emailing them. And when some stitches came loose she got it exchanged for a 4g, only had to pay postage. Can't beat their customer service, although I have to say those problems shouldn't arise in the first place, especially considering it didn't have a safety loop around the buckle.   It'd be great if there was a brand that incorporates all the good things. I'd have paid a lot of money for one that's adjustable for toddlers, with high back, good padding, bag loops, foot straps, a big enough pocket and good customer service :P"
babywearing,2oulnn,bambiontheshore,1 point,Fri Dec 12 08:08:29 2014 UTC,"I use it with my 2.5 year old. I did not like the ergo when I tried out my friends. And when the chest clip is used, at least for me, it pulls most of the weight off my shoulders anyways so the padding amount is negligible. My friend has a manduca that's pretty awesome but it's pretty difficult to get one in the us."
babywearing,2oulnn,strawberrycc,3,Fri Dec 12 08:44:39 2014 UTC,"Do your mean it will fit newborn through toddler? The only carrier that can truly do that well is a woven wrap. If you do go for a buckle carrier for a newborn you will need a compatible insert. A blanket rolled under the bum is not enough support for a newborn. Woven wraps and ring slings by far provide the best positioning for a newborn, so maybe a ring sling in the beginning and a buckle carrier or mei tai for later?  If you mean you want a carrier that fits the wearer ""one size fits all"" most carriers fit a wide range of adults. Mei tais and wraps are nice for switching between wearers because there is nothing to adjust. Buckle carriers need to be adjusted between different wearers."
babywearing,2oulnn,fancypig,2,Wed Dec 10 21:08:38 2014 UTC,I made a Moby style wrap and it's balls hot.
babywearing,2oulnn,sellyberry,2,Wed Dec 10 16:17:31 2014 UTC,"I really love my Moby Go. I've been using it since she was technically too small for it (recommended weight starts at 15 pounds, we started when she was 10 ish, with the help of a rolled up blanket) about 9 months ago.  She is currently about 20 lbs and 1 year old.   I also have a Moby Wrap, but I haven't even pulled it out of the closet for like, 8 months. The Go is just more convenient."

babywearing,2okdtr,catchatorie,2,Sun Dec 7 22:07:56 2014 UTC,Really? Does that go for all carriers? The instructions with the Babyhawk says to froggy them. The leg holes are wide enough apart at 3.5 months that she can't sit with legs out without doing an awkward split. I'm just not sure how I'm supposed to wear her then.
babywearing,2okdtr,catchatorie,2,Sun Dec 7 22:44:32 2014 UTC,"From what I understand, the recommendation for putting newborns into the froggy position was a general recommendation dealing with potential hip injuries, and the legs-out position has since been found to not actually cause hip issues (generally).  I don't have direct experience with a mei tai, but on the babyhawk site those seats do seem to be pretty wide for a 3mo old. However, I found this article, with this tip for wider mei tais:   We recommend legs out in most carriers but if your mei tai seems a bit too wide, you can simply take a rubber band or tie a ribbon around the base of the carrier to make it a bit narrower.    So, you might try that to make your carrier's seat a little narrower and more comfortable for your baby to sit legs-out!"
babywearing,2okdtr,melissa491,2,Mon Dec 8 00:08:23 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the link, it was helpful. The mei tai depicted on the site is similar in width to the Babyhawk. So, I tried narrowing the bottom by tying it with an elastic headband thingy, and this is what it looks like. The seating and legs look OK, right?  With these wider carriers it would be nice if there were snaps on the sides at the bottom so people can narrow it for younger babies if they wanted, kind of like with cloth diapers.   Edit: I just discovered that the Catbird Pikkolo does indeed have a cinch strap/buttons to narrow the bottom part for younger babies. That would've been a handy feature to have :/"

babywearing,2oihm0,Yogicj,2,Sun Dec 7 16:40:01 2014 UTC,"I LOVE my Tula. It's so incredibly comfortable. It's easy to put on for a quick carry, but also good for extended periods. I carried my 8 month old on an intense 7 hour hike in it. I got mine when my daughter was 5 months old, but I've seen people use a rolled blanket with newborns.  The nice thing about a tula is that they maintain their value. If you want to sell it after you're done with it you can almost always get close to what you paid for it. This is not the case with most other brands. Even very heavily used Tulas sell for over $100 on the bst on Facebook. That means that you could use the conversion kit... Or just sell the infant carrier and buy a new toddler, or just trade with somebody. Check out the Facebook group Tula Love if you'd like. You can get a lot of help there!  I could rave all day about Tula. Let me know if you have any questions!"
babywearing,2oihm0,Cannadog,2,Sun Dec 7 11:40:59 2014 UTC,Love love my tula. I have an eye on a wrap conversion. I use my standard on my 8 month old and my almost 3 year old.
babywearing,2oihm0,mcnibz,2,Sat Dec 13 22:34:40 2014 UTC,"It looks like Tula standards last for quite a large age range.. I think somewhere it said to switch when they're around a 2T in pant sizes, but I've seen NUMEROUS people on the swap trade out toddlers because even with a toddler they were too big.   If you search a bit you can probably find the tula infant insert for a decent price. I paid $30ppd for one just about brand new. I know some stores have them for $45, but I didn't have anything else to get for free shipping.  The insert is recommended til they hit 15lbs which my other babies hit pretty darn quick (even starting at 7lbs as newborns).   The main thing for me is that Tulas hold value. It's super easy to resell them and this is likely our last baby. I've kept them in mind for many of our purchases (diapers,etc) because its a much better deal if I can get most of my money back -- and for some tulas the price just goes UP. My tula, however, is basic (Cloudy) with an over the top cute accessory set (hood, straps, etc). The one wrap we bought will definitely go up in price because it's extremely hard to find and I've rarely seen it up for resale.   Just something to keep in mind if you do get a Tula. Spending a bit more might allow you to get your $$ back later."

babywearing,2oihm0,whambat,1 point,Sun Dec 7 08:32:51 2014 UTC,"Like the Boba, the Manduca has an integrated infant insert.  I know that a lot of people say, ""Just roll up a towel"" or ""pop a prefold under their bum"" but with both an Ergo and a Tula, the infant insert is needed for the first 5-6 months.  It's not just about their little legs not fitting out the sides, and their hips being stretched, it's also about their spines being properly supported.  It's not good for baby to be in an Ergo or a Tula without an insert."

My son just turned one and we use it every single day. It's just so easy and worth every penny to me, especially since it's hard to ever know if you're getting a genuine ergo.

Or even look for a local baby wearing mom's group and see if there might be someone who would let you try them out. I went to my first meeting to try a tula from the LL, and my squish was really too little (3weeks) to fit, but I found out I am in love with ring slings.   That being said, I have never tried an ergo, but I am currently using a Tula from the lending library and I'm in love. Compared to the ergo, I know that the straps are more padded, and there is lots more room for adjustment. The panel itself is also taller and I think a little wider, so it will allow for bigger babies, which means more use out of it. They also tend to hold their value completely, where as an ergo gets about 25% less than retail on the used market."

babywearing,2o2m7v,SugarandSass,6,Wed Dec 3 17:08:25 2014 UTC,"My protip is that you can pop baby in and out of the Moby without taking off and on. I used to put mine on and make sure it fit baby, then put baby in carseat, leave moby on and drive places, basically do whatever until baby needed to go back in, then tighten a bit if necessary.  Also the K'tan I think is similar to the Moby in hold, but with less fabric. Also there's the Caboo close parent carrier that iirc is all one piece.  Other than that I do a similar thing with my SSC carriers (I have a Beco and a Boba and I've had others). Those are very easy off on (and I tend to leave them on for short trips even when babys not in them) for front carries (which is where you'd start with a newborn)."
babywearing,2o2m7v,I3km,3,Tue Dec 2 20:44:05 2014 UTC,"I think a SSC (any ""ergonomic designed"" will likely do) is the best. I use the hip carry all the time with my 2 year old.

babywearing,2o2m7v,anthonynlee,2,Wed Dec 3 01:54:12 2014 UTC,"I own all of them and if you want something fast an easy the SSC, the ""backpack"" type will be the easiest to get in and out of.   I used the Boba 3G and loved it. Lots of people love Ergo or Beco.  I personally didn't use a ring sling until my girl was 6 months, so I am not sure how that works when they are little little. And ring slings can run from $50 upwards of a couple hundred. Depends on the material. Sakura Blooms are the most popular.   I recommend looking into a local baby wearing group so you can try some out before making a purchase if you are looking into only purchasing one carrier!"

I used one starting around 3 weeks and they are great for little Littles. Takes about a minute to get on and baby in and out. Can leave it on in the car with out it really being in your way. Love it.
babywearing,2o2m7v,pinkpowerranger8,2,Tue Dec 2 20:14:32 2014 UTC,"For small babies I like my Ktan and ring sling. Once they are a bit bigger I usually use ring sling or Ergo. I work from home and use a standing desk. I wear baby in the Ergo and nurse as I work, cook, clean... Ring slings are great but but I feel I have better use of both arms w the Ergo."
babywearing,2o2m7v,sfak,1 point,Wed Dec 3 05:43:15 2014 UTC,How do you nurse in the Ergo? His head is way above my boobs when he's in there and it doesn't really adjust lower from what I can tell.
babywearing,2o2m7v,lampbowlspoon,1 point,Wed Dec 3 17:34:40 2014 UTC,You can loosen the belt so it's more around your hips. Also my boobs sit lower so that helps. It takes a little practice :)
babywearing,2o2m7v,sfak,2,Wed Dec 3 19:23:20 2014 UTC,I love my ring sling. It's so easy and packs up so small. I also wear it around so I can pop the bug in and out quickly. Worked great when he was bitty and still great at 15lbs.

babywearing,2o2m7v,ToMetric,1 point,Thu Dec 4 02:04:07 2014 UTC,"For me, after mastering the moby, I could get my baby in there comfortably and securely much faster than the time it takes to get a comfortable, tight, and secure carry in a ring sling.  Also, since there is two shoulder support, it is more comfortable in the long term.  In the true long term, a woven wrap is my favorite option.  There are some carries that take more time than others, but once you master it, you can get baby onto your front (or better, your back!) in about one minute."
babywearing,2o2m7v,duck_duck_rabbit,1 point,Wed Dec 3 15:46:37 2014 UTC,Ring sling dude. I still use it art 14 months. Quick easy and versatile.
babywearing,2o2m7v,burdydee,1 point,Thu Dec 4 06:24:00 2014 UTC,"If you are looking for comfort and ring sling - look into gathered type (maybe some well made pleated ones come close, but the relatively cheap one I borrowed for tryout was quite hard on my shoulder).  Once you spread the fabric to cup the shoulder, it is just a bit inferior to woven wrap and in my experience quite a bit more comfortable than moby wrap... I am dealing with a heavy baby though. Moby was fine for first few months, but with kid growing it got harder to tie so it does not sag, and my back started to complain.  I don't use our ergobaby at all. Husband does, but front carry only, hip carry is super awkward. Front carry is easier, but just does not feel anywhere as comfortable as woven wrap or (the gathered) ring sling for me.  Look for : either producer of weaved slings, or at least customer of sling rings (to make sure rings are sturdy); check that it is not too narrow - wider is more comfortable. Fancy cotton ones retail at ~90gbp (more for specialized fabric blends -cashmere, hemp, bamboo etc). Regular (usually striped) new ones from good producers -~50 gbp. Do not be afraid to buy used, they are more comfortable anyway :)"
babywearing,2o2m7v,Onetwodash,1 point,Sat Dec 6 21:53:41 2014 UTC,"The infantino mei tei style has been amazing! The Moby rarely lasted for us past the first two months, even within the weight limit before drooping. The mei tei style tying up takes a few tries to perfect, but it allows for front and back carries (and probably hip carry but I will not even attempt it) that can be super fast once you get it :)"

The ring sling is super fast I will put it on under my jacket and before we leave the house, just get her out of the car seat and slip her in for school drop offs and stuff. I got mine through Tula and it was $135."

babywearing,2nwmog,bonniejb,5,Mon Dec 1 03:35:39 2014 UTC,Maybe just put a little muslin square thingy between her head and your chest?
babywearing,2nwmog,am1986,2,Mon Dec 1 07:22:43 2014 UTC,Maybe rub some coconut oil on your chest so there is less friction.
babywearing,2nwmog,spaceheater,2,Mon Dec 1 04:17:45 2014 UTC,I always wore a shirt I could pull up between us or placed a little burp cloth there so his face would be on the cloth instead of my skin when we got a little sweaty.

babywearing,2nsj43,Arielyssa,3,Sat Nov 29 22:18:40 2014 UTC,"Go to a Babywearing International meeting!! They will have carriers you can try on, lots of advice, and it's a great way to meet other moms. I highly recommend it. Every body us so different so you really need to try things on in person. The meetings are absolutely the best way. Just google Babywearing International Texas and you should be able to find a group."
babywearing,2nsj43,silentcecilia,2,Sat Nov 29 22:46:30 2014 UTC,"I really liked the infantino mei tai sash carrier. Using newborn modifications (found via youtube), I started using it for short periods when she was 3 weeks old. I also found it comfortable heat-wise and this is in very hot West Africa."
babywearing,2nsj43,mogokara,2,Sat Nov 29 23:00:32 2014 UTC,"I live in South Florida and run very warm and my son has a temperature regulation issue from a hypothalamic irregularity, so heat is a big issue for us, too. My son lived in the baby k'tan until he hit about 15 lbs and now (24lbs) we use my Wrapsody Stretch Hybrid ever single day and it is never hot and very easy to use. I don't know what I would have done without them."
babywearing,2nsj43,MrsWhovian,1 point,Sun Nov 30 03:04:22 2014 UTC,I am REALLY leaning toward the Wrapsody Stretch Hybrid. I have watched videos on how to nurse with it and it doesn't seem too difficult. I know the Stretch-Hybrid isn't AS lightweight as the Breeze but I don't want to just head-first into a woven wrap since they seem to have a steeper learning curve. If anything I want to use the stretch-hybrid first and move to a woven wrap after I have had a little more practice using a wrap and learning to breastfeed.
babywearing,2nsj43,MrsWhovian,2,Sun Nov 30 03:30:15 2014 UTC,"I have a few wovens and I honestly use the stretch hybrid more. It very easy to wrap in the wrapsody, and is definitely a good way to practice before working with a woven, since they can be stiff and hard to manipulate unless you buy used and already very broken in. If you check the babywearing swap and babywearing on a budget swap on Facebook, you can usually find wrapsodys for $50-60 instead of $90 if you are patient about waiting for a pattern you like."
babywearing,2nsj43,lisatlantic,2,Sun Nov 30 12:37:28 2014 UTC,"Definitely try to find a local meeting with a library of carriers. I would suggest a linen blend wrap or ring sling to stay cool, but wraps can be intimidating for first timers, and both will probably be more pricey than an Ergo (they retain their resale value pretty well though). Check out one of the many carrier selling groups on FB. Babywearing on a Budget is for carriers under $100."
babywearing,2nsj43,am1986,1 point,Sun Nov 30 12:19:44 2014 UTC,"I was in the same situation just a couple of months ago,it really is overwhelming!I ended up going for a mei tai and I really like it,I found it really easy to put on and comfortable.I watched a few YouTube videos about wraps and they seemed really complicated to me.However my little man is twelve weeks and I decided to buy an inexpensive wrap (just to try it out) about a week ago and I love it!Had a few practice runs in the house and one venture out and he seems to enjoy it in there and be comfy.Still mastering getting him in it though ha!  I would definitely recommend watching a few YouTube videos about the carriers you are considering and the different carried that can be done with them,it really helped me make a decision.it will also show you if there's a nursing position (I didn't breastfeed but I believe ring slings and wraps are best for nursing,don't quote me on that though)  Hope that helps and good luck :D"
babywearing,2nsj43,fancypig,2,Sat Nov 29 23:03:48 2014 UTC,Thanks. That does help.
babywearing,2nsj43,fancypig,1 point,Sat Nov 29 23:07:26 2014 UTC,I highly recommend finding a local group and seeing carriers in person! Some groups even have weighted dolls so you can get a better idea of how the carrier feels. For a newborn I recommend wraps or ring slings. Mei tais are great for older babies but don't provide the kind of all-around support a squish needs. :)
babywearing,2nsj43,msuaussiemom,1 point,Sat Nov 29 23:17:51 2014 UTC,So far I have been leaning toward either this one or this one. It seems like the Breeze will be more lightweight but has a higher learning curve whereas the Stretch-Hybrid is a bit heavier but might be easier for someone like me that will be new to both babywearing and breastfeeding.
babywearing,2nsj43,catchatorie,2,Sat Nov 29 23:51:22 2014 UTC,The stretch is definitely better for a beginner and really isn't thick at all :)
babywearing,2nsj43,merveilleuse_,1 point,Sun Nov 30 06:09:19 2014 UTC,"Just a warning, the stretchy wraps suck for hot weather. But I will say they are awesome for the newborn stage. I used a Moby for the first few weeks, then the ergo. I never bought the infant insert, I just rolled up a receiving blanket. If you check YouTube there are videos on how to do it. I live near memphis so it gets very hot and humid in the summer. My daughter was born at the end of April and I was comfortable with her in the ergo while being outside all summer chasing my 2 year old."
babywearing,2nsj43,RayningAcid,1 point,Sun Nov 30 02:06:34 2014 UTC,"My LO is 6 weeks old and I have a baby k'tan and a ring sling. The k'tan has been awesome so far and I think it's perfect for a newborn, plus they have a (""breeze"")[ http://www.babyktan.com/breezewrap.html] version which is made with breathable fabric. I doubt I will be using this one fur very long, the stretchiness seems like it would feel very insecure with a bigger baby.  I've tried out the ring sling a few times but it feels really awkward to me. I think once my daughter has mastered her head control and I can use the hip carry it will be a more attractive option. It's supposedly the best for nursing while wearing, but I can't wrap my head around it.  I will also advocate for finding a local baby wearing group. I went to a group hosted by a small baby-related store and they actually had all kinds of wraps and carriers that you can rent to try out and see what you like before you buy something. If you can try out wraps and stuff when your baby is a couple weeks old, that might be the best. I don't know how you could get a good feel for things while pregnant, belly in the way and all that..."
babywearing,2nsj43,peaceandkim,2,Sat Nov 29 23:51:15 2014 UTC,I have heard ring slings are great for breastfeeding but I would prefer something that went across both shoulders. It would make me more comfortable knowing LO is secure in there.
babywearing,2nsj43,vickyrichy,2,Sat Nov 29 23:55:14 2014 UTC,"Going across both shoulders spreads the weight, which can be important as the baby gets heavier, but the baby will be very safe and secure in a properly adjusted ring sling."
babywearing,2nsj43,astrodog88,1 point,Sun Nov 30 09:05:24 2014 UTC,"baby k'tan   I second this.  I know several people who have owned these, and say they are fantastic for breastfeeding and ease of use.    Are you on facebook? There are many groups where you can buy baby carriers second hand (usually not used much as we baby wearers are a churny bunch :P )"
babywearing,2nsgjg,mommimoo,2,Sat Nov 29 21:52:10 2014 UTC,I love using wraps but an easy to use cheaper option might be a mei tai.
babywearing,2nsgjg,philanngeez,1 point,Sat Nov 29 22:15:39 2014 UTC,Most non-SSC carriers will be fine for sitting down and are adjustable for nursing. A ring sling won't go around the waist at all and IMO is the easiest to adjust for nursing. If you want something two-shouldered you can look into a wrap or a mei tai (unstructured waist).

babywearing,2nsgjg,vickyrichy,1 point,Mon Dec 1 16:00:33 2014 UTC,"It sounds to me like a ring sling would suit your needs. They can get uncomfortable for long time periods of wearing, since all the weight is on one shoulder, but that's likely not such an issue with a newborn. Also with many of them, you can use on both shoulders so you can switch back and forth if necessary. They are also great for breastfeeding.  Popular brands are Maya and Sakura Bloom, although wrap conversion ring slings (WCRS) are supposedly much more supportive. And there is infinite variety!  Also, you asked about wraps, and yes, they would definitely suit your needs. Your best bet is to get one that's 100% cotton in your base size (it's easy to look up sizing recommendations). It'll be more $$ than a ring sling, but also more versatile!"

Or just use your imagination."
babywearing,2nq7jo,Jupiterfem,3,Sat Nov 29 18:55:28 2014 UTC,"Actually the information you posted is outdated and incorrect.

It doesn't distribute the weight as evenly, as an ergonomic carrier."
babywearing,2nq7jo,burdydee,1 point,Sun Nov 30 07:10:54 2014 UTC,"Still, you speak of a problem.  As far as I know, babies aren't screened for the existence of any preexisting conditions, including potential hip issues, unless something is already apparent.  Plus, there is the comfort issue that is quite irrefutable by anyone who has attempted to test it or has ever sat in similar positions.  So, we have carriers that cause no problems and those that do.  From there, it is every parent picking what they believe is best for their child."

babywearing,2ndpqa,lambeekins,3,Tue Nov 25 16:38:55 2014 UTC,She is already 13 lbs that's why I didn't get a moby/boba
babywearing,2ndpqa,momonomicon,2,Tue Nov 25 19:18:22 2014 UTC,"I did a lot of cradle hold in my sling because LO didn't like being up against my chest. For me, the trick was to put her in upright like she would be sitting and then lean her back.   Though you do have to keep an eye out for airway blockage. If my LO had let me do heart to heart I would have. It's safer and more comfortable."
babywearing,2ndpqa,momonomicon,2,Tue Nov 25 17:15:37 2014 UTC,I put her in it today and she seemed to like the heart to heart. Still was incredibly awkward to get her in and out
babywearing,2ndpqa,burdydee,1 point,Tue Nov 25 19:19:34 2014 UTC,"It'll get less awkward as you get used to it. I personally didn't find getting her out to be too awkward,  though. I just loosened by pulling the bottom ring away from my body, lifting her up on my shoulder like burping, and then pulling the fabric down under her legs. Is that how you're doing it? You might need to loosen the fabric more before you can get it under your baby's legs"
babywearing,2ndpqa,Soirenoir,2,Tue Nov 25 22:02:37 2014 UTC,Cradle hold is no longer recommended. Please watch airways.

babywearing,2mzsk8,whatdoesascannersee,1 point,Fri Nov 21 18:18:45 2014 UTC,I'm still growing him. ;) But I know this would be a carrier for when he's more than 15 lbs. I also have a ring sling a friend gave me.
babywearing,2mzsk8,whatdoesascannersee,1 point,Fri Nov 21 19:57:00 2014 UTC,I see! Well it is really a matter of preference. It's nice to have a few different carriers...I like to substitute a jersey knit wrap in place of a moby because I can do so much more with it.
babywearing,2mzsk8,fancypig,1 point,Fri Nov 21 20:03:56 2014 UTC,"I think it's a great front carrier for an older baby. It's wide, and I think baby would have to be closer to six months old before fitting in it properly. It fit my two year old no problem, and even my four year old fit in it reasonably well.  As far as back carries go, yes you can but the straps will cross in front. Not a deal breaker for some but there will be boob squishing going on for sure. The unique straps prohibit the level of tight cinching you get on most SSC's, so not everyone can get the straps right enough for a back carry. I could barely get it tight enough as a size 14 larger-busted woman wearing a toddler.  But! All of that being said, the straps make for a very comfortable carrier, one I will probably add to my stash for a future squish :)"
babywearing,2mqb7t,TempleU,7,Wed Nov 19 02:23:40 2014 UTC,"That is a whole lot of cuteness for one wrap. Your littles are absolutely precious and you look like a pro already! Careful to keep chins off chests, but other than that, no critique from me."
babywearing,2mqb7t,saratina,7,Wed Nov 19 05:28:36 2014 UTC,Wow! Great job :) Only thing I would suggest is to try and get them a little higher but I've never wrapped two this way so im sure it's no small feat!
babywearing,2mqb7t,iliketoasttoo,3,Wed Nov 19 02:38:42 2014 UTC,"it should get easier with practice and as they get older, but work on your tightening, particularly the top rail. looking pretty great though!"
babywearing,2mqb7t,nichole123,2,Wed Nov 19 15:45:22 2014 UTC,What a great feeling! Never was an everyday carry for me. I prefer front back and shorter wraps. Anyways I would try a rolled up wash cloth to support their heads better.

babywearing,2mpzzi,woolymarmet,6,Wed Nov 19 00:42:21 2014 UTC,"You didn't waste your money.  If there's one thing I've learned having a baby it's that you have to try everything multiple times.  What they don't like right now they might love tonight, next week, next year.  My guy is 15 months now and it's great to have so many transportation options, especially here in the big city.  Try both you carriers, try them at different times of the day, when she's happy or upset, maybe with some padding under her so she's up higher, whatever you can think of to switch it up.  Don't be afraid to let her her fuss a little; sometimes it takes them a minute to decide that this new thing isn't so bad.  But just keep trying.  It's totally worth it."
babywearing,2mpzzi,Areia,2,Wed Nov 19 01:12:26 2014 UTC,You are right. I need to take a deep breath and just keep trying. I put her back in the ring sling tonight and got an hour or so with it. And I'm going to try adding some bottom padding to the Pikkolo the next time I work up the nerve to try it.
babywearing,2mpzzi,eve-,1 point,Wed Nov 19 04:18:20 2014 UTC,"With my Pikkolo, I put the waist belt extra high and cinch the seat/leg area a little smaller, and she is able to sit higher in it. The idea is to use up some of the height of the carrier along the inside... like folding over the top of a sock, or... Words are failing me so here's a drawing: yellow is straps, red is carrier body, blue arrows point at what I'm trying to say. You remember how the Ergo, the spot where the baby sat was always right above the waist belt? With the Pikkolo, sometimes my belt is a lot higher than her bum, and it makes the top seem shorter... am I explaining this well at all?  For my daughter and I, where I am wearing her and what I am doing is very important in whether she will enjoy being worn. She has never fussed being worn in a loud, bright, busy place like the grocery store -- but she whines when I try to just wear her while I do household chores. I don't know if you are breastfeeding or not, but giving her the boob in the carrier is absolutely necessary to get her to chill amd relax in the carrier at home. Busy active baby is hard to get to relax!"
babywearing,2mpzzi,Yogicj,1 point,Wed Nov 19 12:10:58 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the helpful hints. And I like your drawings! I'm pretty sure I get what you are suggesting. I'll give it a try today.   I'm intimidated trying to nurse in the Pikkolo yet, especially since I've barely been able to put it on with her in it. I've nursed in the ring sling, though. It's a big reason I got one. Thanks again!"
babywearing,2mpzzi,Icy_candy,3,Wed Nov 19 14:21:05 2014 UTC,"Mine likes being worn but not in the house, so no chores are getting done here haha.

babywearing,2mpzzi,iliketoasttoo,1 point,Wed Nov 19 03:20:56 2014 UTC,"I think the problem is mostly my size, not the carrier itself. I'm pretty small - 5'2"" and like 120 lbs. I think it's a good carrier. But it feels bulky on me. The shoulder straps are a little wide, and the hip strap makes it very difficult to bend over, so I can't do housework. It's supportive, though, and fine for a lot of walking or standing. I may keep it for my husband to use. I think an average size lady would do much better in it, too.  I really like the way the Catbird Pikkolo feels. It's similar to an Ergo, but is less bulky. Only now I have to convince my baby to like it as well. :)"

I'm sure you're not keen on running out to buy another wrap, but the k'tan (small) has been perfect for my daughter and I.  She's out like a light within 3 minutes of being in it, and it's light-weight and easy on my back. Someone else recommended it to me as a good carrier for ""petite moms"" and I found it was a great recommendation."

babywearing,2m82ts,momonomicon,11,Thu Nov 13 22:26:41 2014 UTC,You can wear a hoodie backwards under your coat. A cardigan would work too. Using the sleeves will hold it in place. They do also make commercial covers and baby wearing jackets. But using a hoodie means that you probably won't have to buy anything
babywearing,2m82ts,sellyberry,4,Fri Nov 14 01:46:13 2014 UTC,"""won't have to buy anything""... I like it!"

babywearing,2m82ts,sellyberry,2,Fri Nov 14 19:59:24 2014 UTC,"I do carrier, baby, hoodie, coat. You could probably do hoodie last if you wanted to tie the sleeves around your neck or something instead. Unless the hoodie is really big and can fit over the sleeves of your coat, I guess. That might look weird, though"

babywearing,2m82ts,mankypants,2,Fri Nov 14 00:26:40 2014 UTC,"We picked one up! It's a rain or shine cover and it ties on to the carrier (we use ergo) or stroller. I've used it a few times with both and it's been great.   I wanted to add though that my guy was born last October and we made it through last year's winter in the Ergo by layer him in a lot of clothing. That meant babylegs, onesies, socks, and eventually one of those teddy bear fleece jumpers (we got a Columbia brand one off Amazon - pretty inexpensive, about 30 bucks, for the use we got out of it). I made sure to have some thicker sweater on, but baby kept me warm too."
babywearing,2m82ts,Flewtea,3,Fri Nov 14 02:15:27 2014 UTC,"Zipped my polar fleece jacket over top. If you don't have anything stretchy, use one of your husbands jackets. Nice and warm. Leggies still dangled out, so I got some booties for wind proofing.  Once there was snow out, and it was windy, I bought a man's xl sized raincoat to wear over top of my polar fleece. Super warm baby, and I was nice and dry too. Post baby wearing, my partner could use the rain coat."
babywearing,2m82ts,eve-,2,Fri Nov 14 17:12:57 2014 UTC,"I saw a few interesting contraptions in a maternity consignment shop. It's an extra fleece panel that zips onto your regular jacket and it was only around $10.  But as for what I've done the past two winters, yes, I just left my coat open. With her in a good fleece jacket/sweatpants/boots/hat/mittens, even just having the sides of my coat around us was plenty to keep us warm and I live in MN, so winters are not particularly mild!"

Still easier than putting baby in a snow suit."
babywearing,2m82ts,momonomicon,1 point,Fri Nov 14 17:17:41 2014 UTC,"I have one of those.  It fit great over my Ergo.  On really cold days I would wear my husband's coat over the top of both of us as well.  We looked a little ridiculous (my husband's coats are at least 3 sizes too big for me) but we stayed warm.  This year I asked for one of these for Christmas.  I'm sure it won't be great for spending a long time outside, but since most of our outings are basically going to involve going from the car to a heated building, it should be enough for most things."
babywearing,2m7z27,CactusCait,4,Thu Nov 13 21:54:07 2014 UTC,I'd guess any good woven wrap would work
babywearing,2m7z27,eve-,2,Thu Nov 13 22:08:48 2014 UTC,"Ring slings can still work for this size baby. You may need to do some adjusting, we love the ring sling and it's the easiest way for us to nurse on the go. Also I second the woven wrap comment, that are way versatile but have a steeper learning curve."

Other than that, pick something you think is pretty. I paid a bit more for my Gira dark rainbow, but I am so glad I did. It is something I am planning on using with all of my children so I feel better about the investment."
babywearing,2m1fzs,momonomicon,3,Wed Nov 12 23:52:12 2014 UTC,I looked it up just to double check because I thought a size 6 was under 5m. Here are the standard sizes (from PaxBaby):  size 2 –  2.7 meters = 8.86 feet = 102.36 inches  size 3 –  3.1 meters = 10.17 feet = 122.05 inches  size 4 –  3.6 meters = 11.81 feet  = 141.73 inches  size 5 –  4.2 meters = 13.78 feet = 165 inches  size 6 –  4.6 meters = 15.09 feet = 181.10 inches  size 7 –  5.2 meters = 17.06 feet = 204.72 inches  size 8 – 5.60 meters = 18.37 feet = 220.47 inches

babywearing,2m1fzs,34F,2,Fri Nov 14 01:36:32 2014 UTC,You need an indio.  A 6 will be the most versatile and longest lasting.
babywearing,2m1fzs,meeksthecat,1 point,Wed Nov 12 04:20:38 2014 UTC,I've heard a lot of people rave about indios. What makes them better than other wraps? And what fabric/blend would you recommend?
babywearing,2m1fzs,meeksthecat,3,Thu Nov 13 02:42:38 2014 UTC,"There are so many different kinds of indios, there's one for everyone. They're (usually) kind of grippy, but still forgiving. I'd go with a 100% cotton one because they're easy to care for and come in lots of pretty colors."
babywearing,2m1fzs,34F,2,Thu Nov 13 03:21:36 2014 UTC,"100% cotton for your first one! That's the easiest to care for and will be nice and soft. Indios are supposed to be very soft. They're made by Didymos. Also check out Didy Liscas, I've heard those are awesomely soft for newborns! There's a Didymos group on Facebook, and also groups for Indios and Liscas. You can join and just lurk so you see what's out there."
babywearing,2m1fzs,silentcecilia,2,Thu Nov 13 19:08:13 2014 UTC,"Definitely get a size 6, unless you're a bigger person.  Check out the babywearing swap facebook group.  See if you can find a chapter of babywearing international in your area - google it.  You can go to meetings and feel wraps, ask questions, and learn how to use it before squish gets here.  My preference for a wrap would be a natibaby bamboo blend, well broken in.  Good luck!"
babywearing,2m1fzs,sasha_says,2,Wed Nov 12 04:35:27 2014 UTC,"OP said she wanted something that would last longer than the newborn stage, would the bamboo blend hold up?"
babywearing,2m1fzs,silentcecilia,2,Thu Nov 13 03:07:29 2014 UTC,"Yes, at least through 30 lbs I would think. Particularly a bamboo cotton blend. Natibaby makes the best ones IMO."
babywearing,2m1fzs,strawberrycc,2,Thu Nov 13 04:58:07 2014 UTC,"Size 6. It will be hard at first to learn, but just keep practicing. With that price range,  you can get a little frog. I like the linen blend, as it's better for heat in the summer but still keeps you warm in the winter. With shipping, my size 7 was $110. I ordered from the little frog website."
babywearing,2m1fzs,ktbug242,2,Wed Nov 12 11:48:28 2014 UTC,"I would definitely get a longer size. My first wrap was a size 6, and I love it. I got my first wrap from Ellevill, its an el merino Carl. Totally newborn worthy!! Its super soft straight from the box!"

babywearing,2m1fzs,sasha_says,2,Wed Nov 12 13:35:45 2014 UTC,"So...in all honesty, I am not familiar with the advantages of woven wraps. I am considering a wrap, but I was thinking of a bamboo fiber blend because it is breathable, antiperspirant and super soft. Can you share exactly what about wovens you all love so much?"
babywearing,2m1fzs,34F,2,Wed Nov 12 18:35:07 2014 UTC,"I don't have much experience yet with any kinds of wraps, but the reason I was interested in a woven is a) they are more versatile than stretchy wraps and b) in my opinion, they are more beautiful.  Stretchy wraps are good for a pretty limited weight range; depending on the wrap they may not support heavier babies, and usually not toddlers. It's also unsafe to do back carries with stretchy wraps.  With a woven, as far as I know, you can get from birth to toddlerhood with one wrap and, depending on the size you get, do basically any type of carry you want.  The problem with woven wraps is they are so dang expensive, but I figure if I can get years of wear out of it, it might be worth it."
babywearing,2m1fzs,Lookingforabook001,2,Wed Nov 12 20:11:48 2014 UTC,"I'd try to stick to 100% cotton for more versatility. Bamboo would give it more stretch and give for a newborn and linen or hemp would give it more support for an older baby/toddler but 100% cotton should meet your needs right in the middle and last for the longest.   From looking at the swap groups the wraps hold their value pretty well so if you wanted to sell/trade your wrap in the future for a ""toddler worthy"" wrap you probably could.  I don't have a ton of experience with baby-wearing if someone else wants to correct me but this is what I've gathered from research and asking friends who've worn multiple kids from newborn through toddlerhood."
babywearing,2lxoeq,Ocipura,7,Tue Nov 11 04:39:07 2014 UTC,"Is this in a moby? How heavy/old is babe? I would say you would both probably be more comfortable with him higher on your body, so his head is almost nestled into your neck, or just to the side.  In a stretchy wrap, the higher you can get him to start the better.  I know for women with bigger busts, it's sometimes hard to get comfy in a stretchy wrap and it might be better to try a woven.  Is there a chapter of BWI in your area where you could go to get some hands-on help?  http://www.babywearinginternational.org/"

If I wear him any higher I think there won't be room for his knees because of my breasts, but that may very well be the problem. My mom actually made me a non-stretchy wrap that is in the mail on its way here, so maybe that will help too.  Thanks!

babywearing,2lhgjj,mellontree,2,Thu Nov 6 19:37:12 2014 UTC,"Ok, what you have here is a high street carrier. Also unflatteringly known as 'crotch danglers.' You can make this more comfortable for facing in by using a scarf to put baby's legs in a more ergonomic position, but you can't do a thing for facing out. This particular type of carrier, while not dangerous, can be very uncomfortable for both baby amd wearer. Which is what you're finding. They won't cause but can exacerbate pre existing hip dysplasia issues.   As for facing out, it's not recommended for longer than half an hour really because it can over stimulate baby and they can find this very stressful. Having said that, some babies seem to prefer it.  If you want a buckled carrier that you can use facing out, I strongly recommend the Ergo 360 as it is the only ergonomic carrier that can be used facing out. It will be much more comfortable, last you a long time and will hold its value. Should choose to buy one, do make sure that you buy it from a trusted retailer (preferably directly from Ergo) as there are many fakes about which are not always 100% safety compliant.   I hope this helps!  Edited to add, the Ergo 360 has a much more supportive waistband for added comfort."
babywearing,2lhgjj,snickiefritz,1 point,Thu Nov 6 20:53:46 2014 UTC,Thank you.  It spreads his legs out for facing in but you are supposed to squish it in for facing out. It works OK for facing in but he gets frustrated that he can't really move or see anything.  I also have a moby wrap but I'm really short and that's a lot of material to wrap around myself.
babywearing,2lhgjj,burdydee,2,Thu Nov 6 21:08:09 2014 UTC,"Have you thought about getting a woven wrap? You can do back carries that allow him to see over your shoulder, or hip carries where he can see more too."

babywearing,2kmr9k,Arsozah,1 point,Wed Oct 29 02:16:01 2014 UTC,Are Tulas similar to the Ergo carrier?
babywearing,2kmr9k,Arsozah,3,Wed Oct 29 02:17:16 2014 UTC,Very similar. There are slight differences in the thickness of the padding etc but that's about it I think..
babywearing,2kmr9k,MonsoonAndStone,4,Wed Oct 29 07:08:04 2014 UTC,"I adore the ergo. Super easy to get the kid in and out, a handy pocket, sturdy enough to use daily, front, back, and hip carry options. I haven't tried the 360 which allows front-facing-out, but I have a super cute baby that attracts a LOT of attention as is, facing out would be a nonstop barrage of old lady cheek-pinchers so I wouldn't go for it anyway.   My kid is ~25 lbs and I can comfortably front-carry her for hours. Mind you, I started when she was littler - about 8 weeks - so I built up the muscle."
babywearing,2kmr9k,mogokara,2,Wed Oct 29 02:47:20 2014 UTC,Agree. Love the ergo and use it multiple times daily. It's so easy to use and comfortable for both of us.
babywearing,2kmr9k,jlynnbizatch,1 point,Wed Oct 29 09:50:06 2014 UTC,Thank you for the detailed response! At this point it's up between a Boba 4G and an Ergo.  It's good to hear that there can still be comfort with an SSC at even 25 lb in a front carry!
babywearing,2kmr9k,Yogicj,1 point,Wed Oct 29 10:38:53 2014 UTC,"Likewise a big fan of my Ergo.  It's very easy to get on and off and doesn't keep the user constrained.

There's most likely a Babywearing International chapter where you live and you can go to a meeting and try on and play with all the different carriers.  You can even check one out to play with at home to make sure you like it"
babywearing,2kmr9k,Skvrybyr,3,Wed Oct 29 13:46:40 2014 UTC,Kinderpack or Tula.
babywearing,2kmr9k,34F,3,Wed Oct 29 02:07:22 2014 UTC,"Just my opinion, but I guess I don't think of ""beginner"" SSC's because they all have approximately the same ease of use. There's not a big learning curve like there is with wraps and the like. Do you have a nearby babywearing group? The best thing to do is to try some different SSC's on and see what feels most comfortable for you. Some groups even have a lending library."
babywearing,2kmr9k,Skvrybyr,3,Wed Oct 29 13:18:05 2014 UTC,"At the Store I work at we carry Tula, Ergo, Lillebaby, Beco, Moby Go, and Boba. Our most popular seller is the lillebaby. It is just comfortable for a lot of people. Although I will say that we just started carrying Tula and while it is a lot of hype, I have to say that I love it the best so far. It is just so comfortable. For anyone with an older child, the toddler version just can't be beat (although Lillebaby is coming out with a toddler version any day now so we will see) I personally owned a boba 3g and the 4G has some wonderful improvements, mainly the infant pillow. Ergos hardly ever move for us. Once people try other things they almost never prefer them. Everything else is just so much better. The Becos are hit or miss but are down there with the ergos. I just tried a kinderpack the other day with a toddler and it was quite nice although I still prefer the Tula. I would get a standard tula, skip the infant insert and wait till kiddo hits 15 lbs or just roll a receiving blanket under her butt to boost her to the right height till then."

I have no experience with the K'tan but I thought it was basically a ""prewrapped"" stretchy wrap, so intended for young/small/light/floppy babies. Are you sure you have the right size for you? It sounds too loose. I know the K'tan is sized.   Nursing... Have you heard of ""laid back"" breastfeeding? Do you have a nursing pillow?"

babywearing,2km26f,SugarandSass,3,Thu Oct 30 13:43:16 2014 UTC,"It sounds like your K'tan might be too big. I used the K'tan from birth with my baby until she outgrew it, and when she was sleeping/didn't have perfect head control, I just tucked her head under one of the rails so her face was out but her head was secured.   What carries have you tried? You might need the cradle carry while his head control isn't good:  http://ep.yimg.com/ay/yhst-58539711678420/baby-k-tan-baby-carrier-heather-grey-with-navy-stitching-3.jpg  Kangaroo carry can come next, and that's where I tucked her head under:  http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/baby/detail-page/c26-B000UYFULU-2-l.jpg"
babywearing,2km26f,34F,2,Wed Oct 29 00:48:57 2014 UTC,"I have a size small, which is pretty snug, and we do the cradle position. I think some of the trouble is getting him positioned just so, and some comes from him wanting to lift his head up. I'll keep trying..."
babywearing,2km26f,danibobanny,1 point,Thu Oct 30 13:45:28 2014 UTC,"Ahh, try keeping him upright, I think it's called hug hold in the manual that comes with it? So he's totally vertical and you can tuck his floppy head into the wrap, depending on which side he favors. I also want to add that my Ktan stopped being comfortable for me when baby hit around 12 lbs. My back sucks anyway, and lots of people use it longer. But I have found much better support with woven wraps, if you're looking to babywearing for the long term!"
babywearing,2km26f,tiramisu84,2,Thu Oct 30 15:32:33 2014 UTC,"I had a baby ktan and had the same issue more or less ... Baby was falling down in the middle if I wasn't supporting him with one hand. It wasn't that useful for me bit was better than nothing. I don't know if that's a limitation of the carrier or if maybe I had a smaller size, maybe it might have worked better. I had the right size based in the size chart. Eventually I got an ergo sport which is my carrier of choice now. It is possible to nurse while in motion, but still tricky."
babywearing,2km26f,tiramisu84,2,Tue Oct 28 23:48:12 2014 UTC,"I had the same problem until my daughter was a bit older. By 15 weeks I was ok using it....I really don't know if it was practise or her growing into what may have been a too big ktan.... Or if it was just easier to manoeuvre her into the right place once she was less floppy?! Try a few different positions.  As for your back, make sure to pull the loop down and central, and the extra tie thing - I often wrap around under her bum, so middle is at the front but instead of tying at the back I cross the straps and tie a knot under her bum. This seems to help by back and how supported she is in it.  Don't give up though, I LOVE my ktan now, and still use it at 9 months for a baby ballroom dance class I go to. So jiving in it with no problems - gotta be good!"

If it's new it hasn't been ""broken in"" yet, and linen in notorious for being stiff as a wood plank.  The best way to break it in and get in nice and soft is to use it.  You can also: wash it (according to instructions), iron it, dry it with dryer balls, braid it, sit on it, and pull it in and out of the rings repeatedly.  I don't have experience with linen as the texture bugs me, but even a new woven wrap will need to be broken in."

Personally, I only started enjoying my RS once my baby was old enough to sit on my hip.  Past the tiny newborn stage and pre-hip control, babies all feel like bowling balls in a ring sling!  Woven wraps were perfect for us during bowling ball stage (and right now during toddler nap on back!).  I like to recommend Dolcino woven wraps, as they're soft right away, really great support, and fairly reasonable price-wise. http://www.quirkybaby.com/dolcino-woven-wraps.html  Message me if you'd like to try a woven wrap, but buying isn't an option.    Best wishes!  :)"
babywearing,2k0d5n,ShannonOh,2,Wed Oct 22 17:40:53 2014 UTC,"I have a linen ring sling. I didn't like it at first either, but over being used lightly for a few months and washing it twice it is much easier to use now. LO is 4 months now, and I don't think I started using it until she was at least a month, possibly 2 to give you a reference.    I have a woven that I love, and if I had to choose between the two I'd choose the woven. That said, I use them for different things and I really like having both."
babywearing,2k0d5n,SourJellyTots,2,Wed Oct 22 22:27:20 2014 UTC,"Great comments already. A few more:   make sure the fabric isn't folded over itself through the rings. It is easier to tighten and adjust with the fabric gathered rather than folded, does that make sense? as someone else notes, lift baby while tightening. start with the sling pretty close to already-adjusted. For a newborn, put your elbow in the sling and tighten it up around your folded arm. You shouldn't need much more slack than that.  while you're situating baby in the sling, bring all horizontal excess fabric around to the ring side, so that as you tighten the fabric doesn't have to pass over baby's body. put the top hem (""rail"") at the bad of baby's neck and pull all the vertical slack down to make the seat. It doesn't matter as much for a newborn, but I like the fabric to be smooth down baby's back so I can see where any slack still exists."

You really have to make the pocket deep. Even folding the fabric in half to start might help. Believe me I've seen much bigger moms than you use a ring sling. You got this.

They used to recommend froggy but now realize babies have poor circulation and froggy could put too much pressure on the feet. It's also difficult to monitor to make sure feet are ok :) With feet out it should be easier to pull the fabric between you. The seat is especially important in a ring sling since it's the only thing supporting baby. I like to lean forward and reach in to pull up the fabric. Don't give up!   Also, do you have a local babywearing group? Many have meetups where you can get one on one help."

babywearing,2jm5m4,cassierocksalot,2,Sat Oct 18 16:09:38 2014 UTC,I have tied my baby in my robe with me but added a wide sash higher up to keep him from falling while I got ready in the morning.  Unfortunately robes do a poor job of weight distribution so it wasn't comfy for long even though he was tiny at the time.
babywearing,2jm5m4,roconoco,2,Sat Oct 18 22:38:24 2014 UTC,"I 'tie' my boy inside my dressing gown all the time, but the sash and fabric aren't strong enough to hold him in."

babywearing,2jgy6n,DailyArrowAttack,7,Fri Oct 17 00:16:32 2014 UTC,"A mei tai might be your best bet, if you're not ready to dive headlong into wovens. Easy (some say easier) than a wrap. Not stretchy so it's more secure. Infantino has one out now you can pick up almost anywhere for about $30. If you're on Facebook, join the Babywearing on a Budget group. You can find great items for very little money"
babywearing,2jgy6n,jeannepecan,2,Fri Oct 17 00:23:32 2014 UTC,"Can confirm. I too switched from moby to mei tai after about 5 months for same reasons. They're stylish, easier to put on, front and back carry, comfy and not as complicated as other more structured soft shell carriers.  They're cheap too, I think you can get them for around $16 off amazon."
babywearing,2jgy6n,mankypants,3,Fri Oct 17 10:58:49 2014 UTC,"If you like the style of a Moby, look for a woven wrap. There's a great group on facebook called ""babywearing on a budget"" where everything is <$100"

I haven't become a member, but even just looking at the various FB posts has been SUPER informative!"
babywearing,2jgy6n,anniczka,1 point,Fri Oct 17 14:37:34 2014 UTC,I got a boba 3g once LO was too big for the Moby and love it. A soft structured carrier (ssc) or woven wrap would probably be your best option. Try looking on Craigslist or second hand children clothing stores for used carriers. I found Ergos were very common on Craigslist.
babywearing,2jgy6n,UserNameConfusion,1 point,Fri Oct 17 02:13:38 2014 UTC,"Buckles may be a good way to go too. You can pick up a tula or a kinderpack for easy up and down.

babywearing,2jfs4b,mintlydisturbed,6,Thu Oct 16 18:01:33 2014 UTC,There is a scarf trick that can give you a little more support and may make it a little more comfortable with a narrow based carrier. http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ngMYpuPQ5Oc/UqTMTHt91HI/AAAAAAAACXA/6_lEfGOPUbg/s1600/2013-12-08.jpg.

babywearing,2jfs4b,icedroplets,7,Thu Oct 16 22:29:16 2014 UTC,"If your baby has existing hip problems, it can exacerbate them. If no hip problems, it isn't an issue. There was a huge push in the baby wearing community saying they were unsafe because of this, but its been shown to be untrue.   You might find it uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time because of the weight distribution. Generally this isn't a problem until baby gets a little bigger, but please don't give up on baby wearing if you find it gets uncomfortable!  My #1 suggestion for new moms who want to baby wear is to go buy an infantino mei tai. They're $25 and can usually be found at Walmart and Target. They are comfortable, easy to use, and fit a wide variety of body sizes."

babywearing,2izg19,jlynnbizatch,3,Sat Oct 11 23:16:59 2014 UTC,"We do a few things! What kind of carrier are you using?  When in a wrap, my daughter is usually fine with me in an open jacket (she keeps my front warm) and a blanket tucked into the wrap.  In the Ergo, same deal, except the leg holes let a draft between us, so we usually throw a huge XL down coat I got at Goodwill for cheap. She chews the collar, so that's a thing to think about when coating everyone.  They also make coats especially designed for babywearing, and those are really nice, but I don't know if they are the best solution - they are crazy expensive, so unless you plan on wearing for a long time, I personally wouldn't invest."
babywearing,2izg19,melissa491,1 point,Sat Oct 11 23:22:25 2014 UTC,I use an Ergo.  I have a few bigger coats from when I was prego (had LO in March).  Maybe I'll try to see if they're big enough to get over both of us.
babywearing,2izg19,Areia,3,Sun Oct 12 12:05:09 2014 UTC,"My husband and I both wear our little guy in an Ergo most of the time.  When it's just cool we dress him in a few extra layers, face him towards us and use our winter coats to keep the draft out.  When it gets really cold we use one of these.   That's just one brand of course, several companies make them.  What I like most about that one is that the removable hood allows you to use it both forward facing and as a stroller cover."
babywearing,2izg19,Meilikah,1 point,Sun Oct 12 01:41:14 2014 UTC,We use an Ergo.  I had looked at the carrier covers but haven't purchased anything.  Think I might look more into it.
babywearing,2izg19,Meilikah,2,Sun Oct 12 12:04:35 2014 UTC,I sewed a fleece panel that is removable and interchangeable for multiple jackets. Basically an extension for my jacket that lets it close over the babe and I. If I find picture somewhere I will show (also I don't normally sew so this isn't like a you have to be a seamstress to make.)
babywearing,2izg19,Meilikah,2,Sun Oct 12 13:05:01 2014 UTC,Similar to this  but without the neck piece and you can put a hood in it as well.

babywearing,2iuzhy,SugarandSass,2,Fri Oct 10 18:21:11 2014 UTC,"Aww, so cute! We loved our K'tan. She's getting huge, so we've had to switch to the ergo, but the K'tan was so much easier than wrestling with the boba wrap in the early days!"

babywearing,2iuzhy,SugarandSass,2,Sat Oct 11 23:15:22 2014 UTC,"We switched at about 5 months! We had to switch her to a different carry in the K'tan pretty soon though, because the cradle hold got too small really quickly! Do you do the kangaroo position?"
babywearing,2iuzhy,SugarandSass,2,Sat Oct 11 23:21:05 2014 UTC,"Yes we do the kangaroo position, it's his favorite... He's not a big fan of the other ones. But I have to do it with his feet sticking out so I'm looking for other options!"
babywearing,2is5on,Flewtea,11,Thu Oct 9 18:35:10 2014 UTC,"The Bjorn is only going to get worse as baby gets older. It's not just uncomfortable for them, it's massively uncomfortable for you too and as they put on weight it's going to kill your shoulders/back.   The Moby is definitely quite nice while they're little but even my petite girl was starting to sag in it at about 2 months/10 lbs.  Good carriers generally run in the $100-150 area new, with many woven wraps more expensive than that. However, you can get a Little Frog woven for about $50 and several other good brands for under $100. I would lean towards a woven in your situation so that you can experiment with other holds to nurse in during class and since he's going to be in there for long periods at a time. If you expect him to be in and out a lot, a carrier (we have a Lillebaby) might be easier."
babywearing,2is5on,kateohkatie,2,Thu Oct 9 18:46:59 2014 UTC,"Thanks. Maybe we'll just pass the Baby Bjorn on, then. I did use one on occasion when I was nannying, but since it was somebody else's carrier I just figured it was less comfortable because I usually didn't bother completely readjusting all the straps to fit me better. But... maybe it was just uncomfortable!  I will look into the Little Frog. Are there others of the cheaper brands you would recommend?"
babywearing,2is5on,Flewtea,3,Thu Oct 9 19:03:24 2014 UTC,"There's a FB group called Babywearing on a Budget that should let you find so,etching in your price range.  Watch some YouTube videos for commo. Woven carries (start with Front Wrap Cross Carry and go from there) to see if it's something you might be interested in.  If you or your husband are large you might want to go for a size 7 wrap, but otherwise a 6 should serve to get you started.  Most layered carries (aka ""multipass"" call for a size 6-ish wrap on an average sized person.  Please feel free to PM me if I can offer any advice!"
babywearing,2is5on,pistachioeverything,2,Thu Oct 9 21:11:55 2014 UTC,"I'm honestly pretty new to wovens and not the best person to ask because there's a whole rabbit whole of weaves and fabrics out there--most of what I know is research on The Babywearer forums, etc. The Malice et Miel wraps were also often-recommended, though."

babywearing,2is5on,merveilleuse_,4,Thu Oct 9 19:31:24 2014 UTC,"I definitely loved the Moby for the newborn stage. Watch some actual video tutorials online, though, because I found out, even after following the included instructions, I was carrying my daughter wrong the entire time! Nothing bad came out of it but it probably would have been a lot more comfortable if I had it right. I found that once baby can push themselves away from your chest the Moby isn't very sturdy anymore and should move to a soft structured carrier (Ergo, Boba, Becco, etc) or a woven wrap.  Also, if you want to wear baby for quick trips look into a ring sling. (you can actually make one pretty easily, fyi). As much as I love Mobys they are very cumbersome to put on and take off if you just want to run into the store or something. Plus they can get HOT!  I haven't heard very many good things about Bjorns but I know a friend who absolutely loved hers so if you want to try it out before nixing it, go ahead! You may end up liking it. I personally like my Boba 3g a lot better, and you can find Ergos secondhand pretty often for good prices.  As far as cost, most wraps & carriers are going to be anywhere from $50-$100+, and even $200+ for higher end brands. Try second hand stores and craigslist for gently used ones, though!"
babywearing,2is5on,34F,1 point,Thu Oct 9 19:00:56 2014 UTC,"Oh yes, videos are a good idea -- I tried practising with a stuffed animal in the Moby when we got it from the included instructional card, but it didn't work so well (mostly because my stomach is so big, I think). I will definitel study up."
babywearing,2is5on,34F,3,Thu Oct 9 19:37:38 2014 UTC,"I was handed down a Moby, and didn't even use it before passing it on again. I found the fabric way too hot and drab looking.   I used a Solly wrap for the first 7 months. (A lot softer and lighter weight than a Moby.) We also purchased a Boba carrier so that my SO could carry her as well. We still use this carrier and it grows with baby.  I now have a Boba Air and a ring sling, both of which are great for older babies!!  My advice is start with what you have, find out what you like and don't like and then swap with friends or attend a local baby wearing meeting!"
babywearing,2is5on,mankypants,2,Thu Oct 9 18:55:59 2014 UTC,I'm not too worried about the fabric being too hot since he's a winter baby :) But good to know some alternatives if the Moby doesn't work out well.
babywearing,2is5on,msuaussiemom,2,Thu Oct 9 19:00:47 2014 UTC,"I love and use my ring sling most of all. It's easy to take on and off, fits easily into my bag and it seems more feminine style-wise than other carriers. I used my ring sling from newborn to now , still using it a lot at 5 months. I also recommend a good buckle carrier such as the Ergo or Beco Gemini. When I need to have baby VERY secure and two hands free such as in an airport or walking through the city on a long walk, then I use my Ergo. Or if I need to be doing stuff and it's baby's nap time, I will let baby fall asleep on me in the Ergo. A high quality ring sling such as a Neobulle is about $100 and the Ergo is about that as well. You could probably find a used Ergo too."
babywearing,2is5on,iliketoasttoo,2,Thu Oct 9 21:11:27 2014 UTC,"Since you mentioned you are on a budget, you might want to look at getting a mei tai.  They are often cheaper than a wrap or a soft structured carrier, and if you can sew (or know some one who can) you can often diy one even cheaper. I have one, and I love it."
babywearing,2is5on,sfak,2,Fri Oct 10 09:58:29 2014 UTC,"I want to echo the people recommending a ring sling to you. You can use it right away (although Moby will likely have you covered there) and it will also last for an older baby. You can get super nice ones and you can also get cheaper ones, less than $100 easily and even under $50 for a gauze or linen one on etsy. I've recently heard some criticism of gauze (which is what I have, actually) but I think linen is for sure safe. If you're breastfeeding, I think a ring sling is definitely the easiest carrier to use for that purpose.   Woven wraps are also super awesome and if you decide you like the Moby you can ""upgrade"" to a woven when the Moby gets uncomfortable. And yeah, they can be expensive but they also tend to keep their value really well. And they can definitely last for years.   Start lurking on Babywearing on a Budget and some of the other babywearing swaps on Facebook and you can see what's out there!"

I'm also willing to bet you can find one in nice or perfect condition at a used sporting goods store."

babywearing,2iq6jg,jessimore,2,Thu Oct 9 16:36:58 2014 UTC,"I second the recommendation for Osprey brand carriers. My MIL bought my husband one & it's been a life saver. The ability to dial it in perfectly to fit most anyone (I know some 5'2"" ladies who have 6' tall husband who share the carrier) & the safety/comfort built in for kiddo is awesome.

Must have been a similar device to this one, makes me appreciate all the wraps and soft sided carriers we have now."
babywearing,2ikyv8,colbinator,1 point,Wed Oct 8 03:00:10 2014 UTC,Thank GOD for the options we have now.  I couldn't imagine strapping something like this backpack thing on every time I needed to walk the dog.

babywearing,2ikv8e,aPlusOne,3,Tue Oct 7 17:46:46 2014 UTC,"For newborn - I found the moby wrap best.  Head is snuggly supported, and it's easy to wear around the house, preparing dinner, or sitting in a chair. It's also cheap, and easy to wash, and pack away. Doesn't take up much space.   The only downside with the moby wrap, I found was it is a little unwieldy to put on outside - especially if wet.  But then, you typically won't be in a situation with newborn on the ground, and needing to put wrap on outside.   Once they are a bit bigger, and can support head, you can consider a typical soft-shell carrier. I switched to Mei Tei (from around 4 months) - easier to put on, and more practical for outside, and out and about tasks.  Mei Tei is also very cheap.    Or you could consider the Ergo - a bit more expensive, but also only really useful from about 4 - 6 months.   Start with a wrap."
babywearing,2ikv8e,mankypants,2,Tue Oct 7 19:25:04 2014 UTC,I would look around and see if there is a store or two with carriers you can play with in person. There is a Nikki's Diapers in my city and they have a coat rack full of carriers.
babywearing,2ikv8e,sellyberry,1 point,Wed Oct 8 17:44:20 2014 UTC,"My sling had quickly become my favorite. The Mei Tei was too big and too hot to start with, the Boba also too hot and hard to get in and out of. We got a sling and dad and I both use it easily. I'm guessing that as he gets bigger I'll like the Mei Tei better and we were gifted an ergo for my husband to use."

babywearing,2ikv8e,Sporkalork,1 point,Tue Oct 7 19:11:57 2014 UTC,"I used a Moby for the first couple of months, and it was really nice. I have a Beco Soleil now and it's really comfortable with my 9 month old. I think the best feature of it is that the straps can be crossed while doing front carry, which distributes the weight better. My sister in law just recently switched to a mei tei for her toddler and has found that to be more comfortable than an Ergo."
babywearing,2ikv8e,squishy_fishy,1 point,Tue Oct 7 21:03:40 2014 UTC,"I used a Boba wrap a bunch when my baby was little. We use an Ergo a lot now out and about, and I have woven wraps too. I used to pre-tie the Boba at home and wore it in the car so when we got wherever we were going I could just pop her in. I didn't care for a ring sling, my kiddo would straighten her legs and pop her seat all the time in it. I'm trying to sell it now."
babywearing,2ikv8e,34F,1 point,Tue Oct 7 21:34:03 2014 UTC,"I want to echo a lot of the advice you're getting in here: something stretchy is GREAT for the first few months.

babywearing,2ikv8e,msuaussiemom,1 point,Wed Oct 8 12:56:43 2014 UTC,"My advice is to see if there is a babywearing group in your area. Many of them have meet ups and you can see several different carriers, get your hands on them, and see what you may like. Some also have a lending library so you can try a carrier for a month or so before spending the money on it.   I do recommend the Moby or other stretchy wrap for the newborn stage. But you really need to make sure you know the right way to wrap it before the baby comes. If you don't wrap tight enough, it isn't very comfortable.  You could probably find one second hand pretty cheap."
babywearing,2ikv8e,not-a-cylon,1 point,Wed Oct 8 13:57:04 2014 UTC,"You may find you enjoy using different carriers for different purposes. Personally, I liked stretchy wraps and their variants (moby, boba wrap, k'tan) for the squishy newborn phase. Ring slings can also be nice for newborns especially. Personally, I like SSC's for babies who are a bit bigger...you usually can't use them without a newborn insert until they get bigger (and those things get hot). Many baby carriers do retain their value pretty well, so selling used can definitely be a viable option if you end up outgrowing a carrier or find you simply don't like one. After your LO is born, I'd recommend finding a nearby babywearing group if you can...then you can try out many different brands and styles of characters and see what you end up liking the best."

babywearing,2iddbv,FatTonyTCL,3,Sun Oct 5 17:35:53 2014 UTC,Look into the Infantino mei tai. You can get one on Amazon for $21. Walmart and Target carry them as well. I believe they are good for 8-35 lbs. It's an affordable ergonomic carrier. You both should be able to use it because it has straps that tie and it and be rolled up and shoved into a diaper bag.
babywearing,2iddbv,Flewtea,3,Mon Oct 6 10:24:04 2014 UTC,"I don't know much that's worth spending money on that's also less than $50 of any type of carrier. However, the most versatile kind of carriers are woven (not stretchy, like the K'tan) wraps. A long wrap would fit both of you (or you could get two Little Frog wraps for about $140) and can roll up relatively small, also depending on size. They are also often the most comfortable because they distribute the weight most evenly and have almost infinite variation. However, they also have by far the biggest learning curve and take more time to put on and take off than soft-structured carriers.  I haven't needed to carry our toddler much since about 15 months, when she could walk fast and far enough to keep up well on longer outings. I would still use the carrier on a hike but at the zoo or similar, the stroller is more convenient since it also carries your bags.  However, the carrier got quite a lot of use when she was younger, particularly around the house for doing chores and for grocery shopping before she got strong enough to sit in the cart. We have a Lillebaby and it's been great for us.  Your biggest challenge with the SSCs is definitely going to be finding one that's comfortable for both of you. The dimensions on each brand are fairly different, with some much shorter and wider or narrower and taller than others. I'd say buying one is definitely worth it (particularly one that doesn't need a special insert for young ones) but I would try see if you can both try several brands on and see which seem to fit you best."

I'm sure it depends some on baby's size and yours, but I know a lot of people love them even for toddlers, though maybe not for hours at a time. But I would guess baby will probably be able to be in your other carrier before it's a problem."

I don't go outside though during the  hottest part of the day.  Babywearing is hot since you have a tiny little body pressed up against you.  A ring sling might be nice, less material covering you both, and easy for littles who need to feed often."

He just spent 9 months being held and rocked, warm and snug inside your body, of course he wants to be held. There is no way you can spoil a baby that young, especially by meeting his needs.

babywearing,2i23no,rocket_bag,6,Thu Oct 2 03:16:38 2014 UTC,Tulas are generally more comfortable for longer. Their seats are wider and their panels are higher than the ergo. They also offer more padding in the shoulder straps. I started with an ergo and gave it away once I got my first Tula. I said first because it does become somewhat of an addiction if you have the funds for wrap conversions.

My SO won't wear the Ergo (he only wore the bjorn a few times) and the bjorn just killed both his and my back, meaning that I ended up either dragging the stroller or the Kelty out once the kiddo got too squirmy and I just didn't feel comfortable with the ring sling.  I am concerned about heat with the wovens in the summer- I live in the south and get overheated very fast.  From reviews, I'm thinking I probably should have bought a Beco instead!

babywearing,2hjl5j,peaceandkim,1 point,Sat Sep 27 00:22:46 2014 UTC,"I have the original Ergo and the 360. I like them both for different reasons, and they both get used regularly. The 360 is a little more versatile in its fit, and with the wider waist strap, you can position it higher up on your body, making your baby not feel so low. I find the waist strap on the original digs into my back in a very unflattering way unless I wear it lower on my hips. The shoulder straps on the 360 are less in my baby's face. The straps on the original don't seem to bother her, but she does tend to chew on them. My biggest complaint about the 360 is the loud ass velcro on that larger, more comfy waist strap, and it also has an upper weight limit of 33lbs (limit on the original is 40lbs). I hope that helps. Let me know if you have any more questions about the 360."
babywearing,2hjl5j,Yogicj,1 point,Fri Sep 26 23:21:22 2014 UTC,"Yeah, same deal here with the original - she eats it more than anything, so maybe it bothers me more than her ;) (She chews on the Moby, too, unless we put Sophie in the little seat belt pocket next to her)  So far it seems like it may solve my 2 most irritating issues, but I read all the reviews that HATE the velcro, and I'll kind of miss the zipper pocket."

Just make sure you're working with a reputable weaver.  The design you're thinking of would have to be machine woven (a jacquard weave) and you want to make sure that their yarns don't contain any heavy metals like lead (usually comes about from cheap dyeing materials from what I can tell)."

I would have 2 magnets on the top corners (4 total magnets, 2 on each side) about an inch apart to use like snaps to attach it to the wrap wherever it's desired.

babywearing,2h9blh,iliketoasttoo,3,Wed Sep 24 02:55:35 2014 UTC,"I assume by m shape you mean froggy position. ""M"" position in wearing refers to the fact that you need to keep babies knees higher than her bum to create an ""m"". That said, it's recommended to do legs out from birth. You should be good with a wrap doing a Front Wrap Cross Carry (or whichever front carry you like) with legs out.   It's also recommended to wait to use a SSC until baby can sit unassisted or at least until they have very good head/trunk control as the SSC doesn't adequately support the spine of a squish :)   I hope you guys find a good groove!

As for stretching out, I didn't find it to stretch out all that much, if at all.  Sure, the fabric moves to allow you to get baby in and out, but I didn't experience any massive amount of stretch.  As for breathability, that is exactly why I picked up a Breeze - I live in Washington, DC and summers get extremely hot and humid.  I found that the Breeze was very comfortable for me AND baby.  He seemed to stay cooler than in other carriers and I didn't get anywhere near as sweaty in the Breeze as I did in other carriers.  Hope that helps!"
babywearing,2gydjc,jlynnbizatch,2,Sat Sep 20 17:16:02 2014 UTC,"You mention your k'tan stretching out... may I ask how much your baby weighs? Stretchy wraps like the k'tan do have a safety rating of up to a certain number of pounds, but it starts getting awkward and uncomfortable around the 12-15 lb. range.   My point is that you may wish to consider upgrading to a new carrier that is more comfortable for you and your baby if they are large enough. :) And something on the cooler side, of course."
babywearing,2gydjc,not-a-cylon,1 point,Sat Sep 20 19:38:03 2014 UTC,Thanks. Bub is 3mths and approximately 7kg (15 pounds). I try the ergo ventus but couldn't get the back shoulder straps done up by myself.  What are some other 'cooler' carriers for a hot summer?

babywearing,2gwnhz,mrs_rue,5,Fri Sep 19 23:27:09 2014 UTC,Try to tighten the arm straps. This should bring baby's top closer to you and allow the bottom to sit more towards the back of the carrier. Also make sure the waist belt is good and tight. I usually have to re-tighten mine every once in a while because it will get loose with taking it on and off. Also make sure the baby is sitting on the blanket with all their weight. The blanket should extend to the knees and prevent legs from straightening.
babywearing,2gwnhz,msuaussiemom,2,Sat Sep 20 00:48:50 2014 UTC,This happens to me as well - her feet slides down to the belt. I stopped wearing her in the Ergo until her leg was able to wrap around the narrowest part of m waist.

The ergo seat width is twice as wide as him so he would have to be pretty splayed out for his feet to stick out :/   It seems like the blanket just lifts him up higher in the carrier and his legs still have nowhere to go.  If the seat was narrower like on my lillebaby they could stick out
babywearing,2gwnhz,dddash,1 point,Sat Sep 20 04:49:41 2014 UTC,"I agree that the arm straps have to be tighter, but I think another thing is you might need a bigger blanket.

babywearing,2gwnhz,closetextrovert,2,Sun Sep 21 02:42:16 2014 UTC,So the baby's butt should be at the same level as the top of the waist band?

I love the wrap in theory, but it doesn't seem to work correctly for me. I do need to try it again just to be sure because I'm stubborn. I bought an ergo on sale and use that primarily with my second daughter and it doesn't hurt my back. The fact that the mei tai lets you outward carry is a huge plus.

My baby is only small but both my nieces did this when they started walking. The buggy wasn't good enough and being carried wasn't good enough - they wanted to walk. Really slowly (naturally) and looking at every stone, flower, bit of dog poo, etc. Then when you're all knackered and carrying 6 bags of shopping they suddenly can't walk at all and NEED you to carry them.  My sister didn't babywear but my plan when D reaches this age is just to make sure I have a sling/wrap with me all the time. He can walk if he wants to (and it's safe to) but when he inevitably gets tired I can still carry him without losing my arms."

babywearing,2gezkg,lizbethef,3,Mon Sep 15 00:51:37 2014 UTC,"I love my Osprey! FYI, you can pull the back stand portion in while wearing. It will click into place, and you won't be as likely to whack stuff with the pack."
babywearing,2gezkg,ryzzie,2,Mon Sep 15 04:17:55 2014 UTC,"I've heard such great things about them. My parents bought this for us kind of on a whim without much research, so after I got out of the store I had this ""oh-no did we just spend all this money on something I'm not going to like very much"" feeling, but so far so good! I usually click the stand in when she's on my husband, guess I forgot on myself, didn't even notice!  Have you learned any other tricks as far as fitting goes? My brother who's a good 8"" taller than me was the last one to wear it, and since then I haven't been able to get quite as good a fit as the guy helped me get in the store. My husband and I are roughly the same size, we never have to adjust our other carriers back and forth, so once we get it adjusted we won't have to move it around anymore, but it's still frustrating that I can't get it just perfect!"
babywearing,2gezkg,ryzzie,2,Mon Sep 15 17:10:34 2014 UTC,"I feel like it's similar to backpacking packs, you end up constantly adjusting as you go. This is because your load is constantly wiggling and shifting around, and so are you! Look up proper backpack fitting techniques, and try those. I find that if I get tired of wearing it one way there is always some small adjustment I can make to give me another few hours of wear. There is no set it and forget it with a pack like this for sure, and with time fabric stretches, and our bodies change. Just adjust to the current comfort!"
babywearing,2gezkg,goddesspyxy,1 point,Wed Sep 17 06:11:27 2014 UTC,"Thanks so much for that! I guess I kept thinking of it less like a backpacking pack and more like another baby carrier, which I now realize is so silly. As soon as I read that, it made so much more sense. DUH."

babywearing,2fot17,sneakymink,2,Sun Sep 7 02:45:09 2014 UTC,"I have a tussah silk cotton blend wrap and have borrowed linen cotton blend wraps. Both are very nice for warm weather, but they have a very different feel. Linen tends to be stiffer and takes a long time to break in. Silk is smooth and not very ""grippy"" so you may have an easier time adjusting the silk sling than the linen one.  To really compare though, it would be important to know the weight of the fabric, and to some extent, the blend of the fibers. I looked on the website and couldn't find that information. They make it sound like these are 100% linen and 100% dupioni silk; I've only worn either as blends, so I don't know how comfortable they would be as pure fibers.  If you have a low-weight, thin fabric, it's likely to dig under the knees as your child gains weight. We sold our tussah RS for this reason, and have loaned our lighter (170 grams/sq. meter) tussah blend wrap to a friend with a newborn. I would definitely contact the manufacturer for some of this info before buying. They should happily give it to you, and if they don't, I'd consider that a red flag and look for another brand."

babywearing,2fcna2,pippx,2,Thu Sep 4 12:23:06 2014 UTC,I believe it's inside the hood pocket on a tag. If you bought it used and checked it over I'm sure it's fine. I thought you bought it brand new for $60 and that seemed a little too good to be true :)
babywearing,2fcna2,Cassassinn,1 point,Thu Sep 4 12:38:09 2014 UTC,"Found the serial and it matches the box! Yeah, I thought about buying a new one (khaki/camel was on sale for $69 on Amazon that day), but... I figured I didn't know if I'd like a SSC, and if I did and this one wore out... I could buy a Tula or something to replace it ;) Also, much like a wrap, it is very soft and broken in! Though I know of course the stitching is wearing out and I examine it before each use."

babywearing,2feycs,MakingThings,2,Thu Sep 4 01:50:29 2014 UTC,"I never used a Boba or Moby, but it might be a good way to see of you like wrapping. They are stretchy, and aren't recommended much past 15 pounds, so prob only until 4-5 months. And if you like it, you would want to by a woven wrap (which run $150+ and often much more). If you live near a baby wearing international chapter, you could try a bunch of carriers out and see which you'd want to buy."
babywearing,2feycs,Grapefruit__Juice,2,Thu Sep 4 02:18:51 2014 UTC,"I have a boba, but I've never used it.

I usually loosen the sling when he's asleep, lay down with him, then after a few min get up. It takes some practice which you can do when she's awake until you get the hang of it.  But I agree that it's a phase and it'll pass."
babywearing,2fbc9w,Grapefruit__Juice,2,Wed Sep 3 02:44:16 2014 UTC,"I started nursing her to sleep on my bed (cleared of pillows and blankets, obviously), waiting til she's asleep, unlatching her but staying close, then sneaking away. That way she never moves and I go gradually enough that the change away from body heat doesn't startle her. It has worked sooo much better than anything else I've tried.

babywearing,2evs05,babytoes,1 point,Fri Aug 29 02:43:13 2014 UTC,"They are.  I use a Baby Hawk Mei Tai. He does start high (high enough to put his arms around my neck) but he wiggles around a lot in general and, now that you mention it, he does start to sink.  I'll try to remember to readjust next time."
babywearing,2evs05,mariposamariposa,5,Fri Aug 29 12:46:46 2014 UTC,"He is sinking really far. That shouldn't be the norm even with some wiggling. Do you cross the straps or do a ruck? You can try crossing or twisting the straps to keep it more snug as well.  I'd also recommend you make sure it's snug enough when you start. It almost feels too tight and then loosens up, and it's just right!  Anytime you notice him slipping below eye level, you can untie and do a quick tightening. But you shouldn't have to do it too frequently.   Hopefully you won't have to give up such a useful tool over it."
babywearing,2evs05,ethereal_pixie,1 point,Sat Aug 30 15:15:28 2014 UTC,I've always done a ruck tie.  I may try crossing then and see if that helps.  I wore him off and on all weekend and found myself readjusting a lot. Thanks for the advice.

I want a didymos hemp blend at some point in the near future... Possibly Jade in a 5.   The most important advice I got when I was about to buy my first wrap was to make sure you LOVE the look of it. If you don't love the way it looks, you won't use it, and wrapping takes a lot of practice! I'd also recommend getting something 100% cotton. It is the easiest to maintain and break in. I trialed a linen that wasn't all the way broken in and it was a pain to wrap with. Also, wraps with different colored rails are helpful for learning. Its way easier to tell if you got twisted somewhere if your wrap has stripes. Tightening stripe by stripe is also invaluable when you're trying to figure it all out."
babywearing,2erkp6,icedroplets,1 point,Thu Aug 28 02:23:52 2014 UTC,Thanks for responding. It is so overwhelming trying to pick one out.
babywearing,2erkp6,34F,2,Thu Aug 28 02:27:42 2014 UTC,"It is super overwhelming. I just bought my first wrap after tons of research. I couldn't decide at all and finally I just picked one and went with it! I bought a Storchenwiege Leo Marine in size 5. The major downsides to Leo's, from what I've learned, is that they're hard to break in. But once broken in, people seem to love them so I figured it was worth a shot.  It helped me a lot to go to a local babywearing meeting so I could actually see wraps and try them. I'd fallen in love with the looks of Girasols but when I tried one, I wasn't crazy about the feel. Plus, everything tells me that my base size is a 6, but I tried a 6 in FWCC and the tails hung down to my knees! So I decided to buy a 5 instead.  One good thing is that wraps keep their value really well, so you can always try something and then sell it or trade it. Check out thebabywearer.com forums. You have to register, but I find it really helpful to lurk on there. It was a thread about Leo's that convinced me that this is what I should get. We just got it a few days ago, so we are starting to learn!"
babywearing,2erkp6,babytoes,3,Thu Aug 28 14:48:51 2014 UTC,"I have owned many wraps (I am a habitual churner!). And the one wrap that has always been my boomerang wrap was an FHI (Flamenco Hemp Indio by Didymos). It is by far the most comfy and cushy, will last all through toddlerhood and it is very solid on wrapping abilities. If pink isn't your thing, I'm sure Emerald, Bordeaux or Deep Blue Red (all Indios and all hemp blends) will have the same or close to the same feel."
babywearing,2erkp6,sipme,2,Fri Aug 29 00:00:01 2014 UTC,"You can't go wrong, IMO. If you don't like a wrap, you can usually get what you put into it back out (or close to it). That being said....  The only carry that I've mastered is the ruck, but baby's starting to pop her seat, so I see more passes in our future.  Favourite wraps? Girasol One Love herringbone weave. Didymos Indio Aurora. Natibaby hemp rainbow. I will probably churn all of the rest, but will always keep those 3."

Next, work on breaking it in.  Iron it, braid it, sit on it, and most importantly use it!  It will soften up in no time :)"
babywearing,2eqqzo,Yogicj,2,Wed Aug 27 21:43:58 2014 UTC,"What Yogicj said! Only, when washing, ensure you use something without optical brighteners as these can cause wraps to fade. Also don't use fabric softener as this can make favric slippery. Enjoy!"

One sling is European linen in pumpkin spice. It's the 70-74 inch (short) size. The other is a taupe linen/rayon blend, also the short size. They both have zipless pockets.

babywearing,2ejqbp,izzyhearts,10,Mon Aug 25 17:44:00 2014 UTC,No. Never use a stretchy wrap for back wrapping. Only wovens are suitable because they do not stretch.
babywearing,2ejqbp,msuaussiemom,2,Mon Aug 25 18:09:23 2014 UTC,"As others have said, you should not use a Moby for back carries. And it's not ideal for an older baby either.  I used a woven wrap to back carry my kid until he was around 5. It was my favorite carrier for all ages. And it can be used as a blanket, ground covering, towel, hammock and more. It was a great investment. And there is a good resell market.  I had a few Didymos. But there are other woven wraps as well. You can find one secondhand. There are swaps on Facebook and Thebabywearer.com.  You could also consider a Mei Tai. It can be a little quicker than wrapping, and it's great for back carries. It has less versatility though.  There are some great tutorials for back carries.   http://babywearinginternational.org/pages/AdvWovenBackCarries.php http://www.wrapyourbaby.com/backcarries.html http://thebabywearer.com/forum/forums/wrap-and-wrapping-basics.115/   If you have a local babywearing group, I'd highly recommend you check out a meeting. You can try out different carriers and get some insight on how to do various carries."
babywearing,2ejqbp,mariposamariposa,1 point,Tue Aug 26 17:52:59 2014 UTC,"If you like the feel of the Moby, get a Wrapsody hybrid. It stretches only vertically but not horizontally, making it ok for your back. Otherwise, get a woven. In either case expect to spend 80-180 bucks. As msaussiemom said, Mobys are not safe for your back.  Your other option is getting a carrier like the Ergo or my Lillebaby and backwearing there--much easier to do than a woven, though around the same price and not as versatile. Baby won't be able to see over your shoulder until they are quite tall and mine's not a big fan of that now that she's a curious toddler."

babywearing,2eaqcl,tercerero,1 point,Fri Aug 22 18:28:25 2014 UTC,"I hear ya, I'm in FL.  You probably won't be going out much to begin with anyway.  I don't think I started really wearing the baby until she was about a month old."
babywearing,2eaqcl,lizbethef,1 point,Fri Aug 22 18:33:02 2014 UTC,I'm hoping to be able to soothe him in a wrap just at home. My right arm is still pretty weak (broke it during my second tri and had to have surgery) and would love to be able to keep him close without actually holding him because my arm won't hold up for long periods.
babywearing,2eaqcl,MonsoonAndStone,1 point,Fri Aug 22 19:15:21 2014 UTC,"I looooved (and still do very much) my ergo-but not until about 4 months. Granted, I had a winter baby, so the stretchy wrap (Moby) was better for want snuggles anyway, but I used the CRAP outta that thing when she was little. She wasn't very colicky, but when she would have a hard evening, on went the Moby-and everything instantly got a little better. I had that thing with me all the time, and it would always soothe her fussiness. But once she got bigger and enjoyed looking out, I'd do forward facing carry (only for very short periods of time)- and then started using the ergo.  Sounds like you've got a good range of options, wish you the best of luck! If you come across struggles come back!   Also, breastfeeding while carrying is GREAT, but takes a lot of practice (IMO), and gets waaay easier when they can support their own head. Don't be too quick to give up, and don't get too discouraged, it takes some patience!"

babywearing,2eaqcl,34F,1 point,Fri Aug 22 19:08:52 2014 UTC,"I love the ergo. It only takes a few tries to get comfy with it and you're right, just a couple buckles and you're ready to go. Invaluable for a baby that needs constant cuddling.   It took probably a couple of months before I could comfortably wear her for longer than 15 minutes or so. Regular wearing will help you build up your core muscles and it'll get easier.  Try them all out and see which one you and your baby like best. You sound very well-stocked to me."
babywearing,2eaqcl,34F,1 point,Fri Aug 22 19:18:13 2014 UTC,"I used a ring sling since my guy was 4 days old and we still use it now (only 15 weeks later, but still). I loved it for its ease, comfort, and ability to breastfed. My husband uses it too, especially to get our son to sleep if I'm not around. I also have the Infantino Mei tai and it's tricky when the baby is super small - we only started using it within the past month - we needed to use the ergo pillow from the inset under his bum in the beginning. That's what I would recommend with the ergo too - the ergo is great, but not as a snuggle option, more to takes walks etc. You're not going to do skin-on-skin with a baby in an ergo - but it'll be great later! I use mine for walks sometimes now (but it's my husbands fave carrier). I never had a stretchy wrap, but it'll prob be your fave in the beginning. We just got our first woven wrap, and if you like the boba wrap and want to continue using that after your babe gets over the limit, wovens might be a good option. Finally, the snugli is a narrow-based carrier, which isn't recommended since it takes baby's body out of optimal alignment. It's best to stick with carriers that will keep baby's bum lower then their knees, with their legs spread out. More info here http://onyababy.com/2012/09/babywearing-baby-positioning/  And Congrats! Babywearing is awesome! I think my son is/was such a chill infant because we always wore him!"
babywearing,2eaqcl,34F,1 point,Fri Aug 22 20:44:51 2014 UTC,"ok, we'll get rid of the snugli, and I'll look for a used ring sling at the consignment place tomorrow.  THANKS!!"
babywearing,2eaqcl,34F,1 point,Sat Aug 23 04:42:26 2014 UTC,"I want to echo what a lot of other people are saying. It sounds like you have a lot of great options! Although admittedly, I don't know much about the Boba or the Snugli. I think the mei tai and the Ergo will probably be better once your baby is a little older. We haven't quite gotten the hang of the Ergo yet at 4 months, but I also have a tiny baby. I'm not a fan of the infant insert (hot!) but others like it fine!  I do think wrap-type things probably serve you best for a newborn. We looooove our Ktan and it is super easy to pop her in it when she's fussy. She takes at least one nap on me a day in it. But at around 12 lbs it's starting to get uncomfortable and we're working on learning how to use a woven wrap.  Ring slings can also be great and some people love them. It is definitely an easy option if you just want to wear the baby for a few minutes if you're running into the store or whatever. You can also get one fairly cheap (I got a gauze one from an Etsy seller for $35). So depending on budget, you can always try one like that and get a nicer one if it turns out to be a good options for you. It is also (I think) the easiest to nurse in. I know older babies can nurse more sitting up like in the Ergo but we aren't there yet!"
babywearing,2eaqcl,goodizzle,1 point,Fri Aug 22 23:33:09 2014 UTC,"thanks for your help, you guys have all been awesome!  I think I'm gonna look for a cheap (probably used) ring sling to try out for when he's bitty, and for nursing (i'm worried about my arm holding up to holding him for nursing)."
babywearing,2eaqcl,34F,1 point,Sat Aug 23 04:46:16 2014 UTC,"If you're worried about your arm, I would definitely recommend a Boppy or other nursing pillow. Before baby has head control, I think this is necessary for pretty much everyone anyway! Then you don't have the support the baby's weight at all."
babywearing,2eaqcl,neonrose,1 point,Sun Aug 24 01:01:50 2014 UTC,"I have a Boppy, which had been totally awesome, but I'm not going to lug it around everywhere. I just had to nurse at the lab while we were waiting for them to draw his blood and we had rig something to help me hold him up. I'm hoping if I had a ring sling or something else it would solve that problem while out and about."
babywearing,2eaqcl,mariposamariposa,1 point,Fri Aug 29 16:29:12 2014 UTC,"Oh yes, a ring sling is great for on the go! It definitely helps with support and I also like that it functions as a sort of nursing cover without being bulky."

babywearing,2d9p20,34F,5,Mon Aug 11 20:43:32 2014 UTC,Storch's are a great option! I know many moms who have them. I also know many who have Giras. I think it comes down to preference of pattern/color. Another great option that is a relatively low cost (so you can decide whether or not wrapping is you) is Little Frog. They have some super cute wraps!
babywearing,2d9p20,that_girl13,4,Mon Aug 11 21:02:37 2014 UTC,"I've tried many, MANY wraps!  And if I could only have two I would take my expensive handwoven, and my Storchenwiege Leo.  The main appeal of Girasols is their beauty.  They don't excel in any one area, but they're just fine as wraps.  Storchenwiege, on the other hand, once it's broken in, it's soft as a t-shirt, wraps like a second skin, supportive as much more expensive wraps, and basically bullet-proof.  The only difficult thing is that it will take quite a bit of work to get a Storchenwiege nicely broken in!    But really, just pick a wrap you love the look of, since that's the one you will keep practicing with until it's easy.  :)"
babywearing,2d9p20,LeahTT,3,Tue Aug 12 01:45:41 2014 UTC,"I agree with you on the beauty of Girasols, but I have to say I wasn't crazy about the feel of it (and this was a used wrap that I tried, so definitely broken in). You're making Storchenwiege sound amazing....although have you tried the non-Leo wraps? It seems like the Leo are great, I just like the stripey look."
babywearing,2d9p20,LeahTT,4,Tue Aug 12 13:26:00 2014 UTC,"I have both Storchenwiege Leo (Café) and a stripes (Eric), and I love them both.  Storchenwiege in general feels tighter and smoother than the more flannely Girasol.  Stipes and Leos have similar wrapping qualities, but stripes are a little thicker, smoother, and denser; and Leos are a little thinner and airier.    Honestly, the only two downsides to Storchenwiege are that it doesn't have as big of a color selection as Girasol, and they take a lot of work to break in.  I'll post the recipe for breaking in a Storch from the Storchenwiege group of FB.  I did this when my Café was new (stiff, scratchy after first wash).  I got a couple of blisters from all the supercoiling, but it was very nice after a week, and it keeps getting nicer.    Secret Recipe for breaking in a Leo (here is mine, feel free to add yours)- 1. Wash, Tumble dry until damp. 2. Iron both sides. Tumble Dry on low. 3. Super coil 2x, twisting the opposite way the second time. Be sure to do a lot of pulling and tugging when it gets all coiled up, try to pull it straight! 4. Rinse in the wash, Iron both sides. Tumble Dry on low. 5. Super coil once every night for a week. Supercoiling really helps with the Uber-grippy, almost sharp texture. I've found that Leos (and other super grippy wraps) are comfortably usable after step 4, and after step 5 are almost perfect. I can do steps 1-4 in one evening after the kids in bed, so like 2 hours or less depending on wrap length. (*I know, i know, we are all moms and don't always have 1 1/2 hours at night to devote to breaking in a wrap, but sometimes i just take the time, because i find it therapeutic, and it's cheaper than therapy bwahhahahaaa!)"
babywearing,2d9p20,Grapefruit__Juice,3,Tue Aug 12 14:25:48 2014 UTC,"Thanks for this ""recipe"" - I just got a Storch Leo Natural this weekend, and I'm planning on breaking it in this week! Question - do you wash it without detergent? And what's this super coil?"
babywearing,2d9p20,LeahTT,2,Tue Aug 12 16:05:26 2014 UTC,"For the first wash I would use some detergent (no optical brighteners or fabric softener) to get any dust/residue off from production, but no need to use detergent again until it's dirty.  This is a video I made about supercoiling.  It's not great, but it gets the idea across.  Just twist it in one direction until it's a big, tight knot!  :)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzeEp-8nTV4"

The goal is to raise the baby's butt and hips so that the feet/knees can comfortable stick out. Here is my long 7wko in ours. You can infer where the blanket is based on how high her feet are.

When you make a dip you get to pick a number between 1-21, and once 21 dips have been made from yourself and others, the admin will use a number generator to pick a number between 1-21, and whoever claimed the winning number wins that carrier.

babywearing,2ciha4,bakemaster,1 point,Mon Aug 4 02:28:34 2014 UTC,"We use Kawaii dipes. Not only are they super affordable, I find them much more reliable than some brands 3-4 times the price.  I have had issues with Little Monsters and Jungle Roos diapers leaking around the snap grommets.  A friend of mine is involved with a fairly new handmade outfit called Starlight Stitches that has Breaking Bad themed dipes that look great. Can't vouch for their reliability as I haven't used them.  For pricey diapers, we haven't tried most of them (because, uh, money) but I like the Blueberry Simplex One Size; the insert is attached and less bulky than cheaper inserts while still being about as absorbent. I guess that's what you pay for.  I find wrapping easier with cloth as well. That big fluffy butt really holds a pass in DH or RR - provided you can bend your arm like Cthulhu to get the pass up over the butt in the first place.  As far as inserts, we've always used microfiber but we're starting to have persistent ammonia smell issues which is more common with synthetics, so we're thinking of trying bamboo or cotton inserts. They also have special cleaners for the pee smell but they're expensive.  Other quick opinions - people seem to really like Alva for value. Fuzzibunz look and feel like crap. There are lots of really beautiful minky diapers that will set you back $30-40 a pop, but if you're considering getting one (say as ""formalwear"") be sure to check if it's waterproof or if it needs an additional waterproof cover."

If you have pee smell or ammonia your cd isn't getting clean enough. Try a mainstream detergent such as tide. Tide is less expensive than so called cloth safe detergents, which seems to be what you are using. Cd safe detergents usually are just a mix of brighteners and sodas and really don't clean. That's why they stink."
babywearing,2ciha4,bakemaster,1 point,Sat Aug 16 16:59:10 2014 UTC,"You misunderstand. Ammonia buildup happens over the course of prolonged use, and mainstream detergents (which are what we use) don't prevent it. It's not the only buildup problem possible with cloth diapers, either; look up ""cloth diaper stripping"" for more information.  We recently stripped ours using a method that involves blue Dawn and lots of rinsing. I'm not convinced the blue Dawn is much more than a placebo though. I expect the many rinses do the bulk of the work."
babywearing,2ciha4,bamstout,1 point,Sat Aug 16 18:19:52 2014 UTC,"Blue dawn should only be used on spots on synthetic fibers from build up of things like oil based creams which can cause repelling. It will wash out of most cotton fibers, but sometimes not and blue dawn can be used.   Rlr is for mineral build up that is not caused by detergent but caused by things like hard water. This does not lead to ammonia smell, but repelling as well.   Ammonia smell is from diapers getting build up over time of urine. If you have a good way routine and use enough soap, you won't have to strip for anything other than fungus. Bleach will get rid of the urea left in diaps from not getting clean. But to prevent ammonia smell,  a good wash routine is needed."
babywearing,2ciha4,bakemaster,1 point,Sun Aug 17 01:29:57 2014 UTC,"What are you thinking of when you say good wash routine, specifically?  We've looked at Funk Rock for the ammonia issue, but my wife wanted to try the blue Dawn first since it's cheaper."
babywearing,2ciha4,bamstout,1 point,Sun Aug 17 02:00:40 2014 UTC,"Ya blue dawn isn't for the ammonia problem,  So it probably did act as a placebo and the rinsing helped. A good wash for an ebf baby would be a rise,  a long wash with the correct amount of soap and water,  and a double rinse. You don't want too much water or too little water in your tank. You want enough that they can agitate against each other while in the wash cycle.  Also be sure and use enough detergent. Use what you would use for your clothes."

babywearing,2cik3g,thegapinglotus,4,Sun Aug 3 17:35:17 2014 UTC,She is wrong. Plastic rings weaken and get brittle over time and can break. I've always heard to use the rings at slingrings.com since they're designed for baby wearing and won't snag your fabric. Stick to your guns! :)

babywearing,2cik3g,I3km,1 point,Sun Aug 3 18:30:10 2014 UTC,"Yeah, whatever. Different ring types are suited to different types of fabric and it's more about the diameter and thickness of the ring than the material of the ring. That's pretty much all.  As long as the rings are good quality (aircraft aluminum or the nylon ones) that's all that should really matter."

babywearing,2cdej2,shadeofmyheart,2,Fri Aug 1 21:27:12 2014 UTC,"Oh, last thing, if you're new to wrapping, you might consider a Mei Tai wrap.  It's easy to get the hang of, cool enough that you could probably use it at home and is good for both front and back carries. I tied mine in an onbu style (basically tie the waist straps into loops and run the sholder strap through the loop and tie that around you) and it was awesome for the plane.  Because you can pre-tie it, you can easily move baby in and out if you're just hanging out in the terminal or if you are taking baby on as a lap child, you can easily slide it off for take off and landing.  The cheapest Mei Tai is this one.  It's easily available at various retailers.  It's not as pretty or exciting as a new wrap I know, but if you decide to include easy to find and cheap in your search, it might fit the bill.  :)"

I haven't really figured out how to use it because of that and because we're having an unseasonably warm summer here.  The Wrapsody is much cooler, more like the material of a bedsheet in weight.  I found it pretty easy to wrap with, it seemed much easier to tighten well and I was able to get my LO in a back carry pretty smoothly.  It's just one size, so that may be a drawback depending on how much fabric you want but it's a nice piece that seems to hold it's resale value reasonably well on the b/s/t facebook groups.

babywearing,2cafyz,eve-,3,Fri Aug 1 01:37:22 2014 UTC,"Yup, past 20 or 25 lbs it will not be comfortable anymore. At that weight you should switch to a thicker woven wrap or an SSC like Kinderpack, which has a mesh panel for cooling."

From what experience that I do have, I would lean towards the Ergo or another SSC.  I have caused myself shoulder pain from mis-tying my Mei Tai (ie, one side was more loose than the other, so the weight wasn't distributed evenly).  Getting the Ergo exactly right can take a little time, but once you do it should balance all of baby's weight well.  The only problem that you might have is that it can be difficult to clip the clip that goes behind your back when you're carrying in the front.  Once I figured out how to juggle my baby around to my back, I actually found it easier to get her into a back carry, simply because I don't have to reach around in such an uncomfortable way.  Since you can't carry over 5 lbs shoulder slung I'd advise against doing a ring sling.  I may have been doing it wrong, but I found that I was carrying a lot of weight on my shoulder rather that on my hips like you will with a proper ergonomic carry.  This may have also gotten better when my baby got bigger and could ""sit"" on my hip, but I am comfortable with my Ergo now so I didn't go back and try again."

Several reasons it may work for you- it crosses on the back, so no reaching over you head to buckle like the Ergo or other soft structure carrier. The shoulder straps buckle on the sides. Also, you can wear it apron style like a mei tai or, add a support belt if you feel you need more in the waist. It's one of the few buckles out there that require very little adjustments for a newborn, and legs can be out from birth. I would seriously consider  a Pikkolo."

babywearing,2bvdfu,anniczka,1 point,Sun Jul 27 18:06:27 2014 UTC,Good to know it's okay to use on smaller babies--that's what google told me but I just wanted to double check! Thanks!
babywearing,2bvdfu,LStanley,2,Sun Jul 27 18:36:24 2014 UTC,"Mobys are definitely the perfect wrap for little babies!! Once baby gets a little bigger, they begin to sag and a more supportive carrier is inevitably needed. I would suggest tying the Moby as tight as possibly (almost to the point where you don't think you could shimmy your little one in). This will help keep baby in place. You can then slide the top rail (instead of one of the crossing passes) up to the center of LOs head! That tends to feel less restricting to baby ;) Otherwise, the cross passes are the best way to support their little head :) Good luck!!"

babywearing,2bs8f8,goddesspyxy,2,Sat Jul 26 15:53:15 2014 UTC,You can cinch up the base of the Mai tai with a hair tie. I can't link at the moment but I'm pretty sure there is a YouTube video about how to do it.   That's what we did with our little guy until he grew enough for the standard width.

babywearing,2bs8f8,ludaachristyy,2,Sat Jul 26 16:20:16 2014 UTC,Yes do practice but a woven behaves quite differently to a stretchy like the moby. I did use a woven on a plane trip but it was tricky. I didn't feed in it. But you could try poppable carries so you can leave it pretied on you and not have to deal with rewrapping from scratch all the time. Front cross carry is one option.
babywearing,2bs8f8,ludaachristyy,2,Sun Jul 27 00:52:27 2014 UTC,"from my friends experience, anything with buckles or rings, you will have to remove your baby. with a woven you can wear your baby through the metal detector since there is not metal.

I can usually pull my breast out enough and his latch is good that once he's on, it's not coming out till he's done. when you're done nursing just readjust and tighten the passes.   here's a link that will hopefully explain better than I did.  http://www.wrapyourbaby.com/frontwrapcrosscarry.htm"

It's also a ""poppable"" carry meaning you can continue to wear it and you don't tie it around your baby."
babywearing,2bs8f8,HoopyGalore,2,Sun Aug 3 15:29:55 2014 UTC,"I was going to recommend this, it should act just like a ring sling. Front cross carry is another poppable carry that I am fond of.

I have that same sling and I used the heck out of it until mine started walking and no longer tolerated being worn. :)   Did you tuck in the tail for a specific reason? Make sure it's not too bunched up around her neck if so. Most people say to keep newborns' legs tucked in and against their chest until their legs are strong enough to dangle.   Also, more than likely the reason it's slipping up your neck is because the babe is too small/light to be worn lower or provide much tension to the shoulder part to stay in your shoulder easily. It should stay on better as she gets bigger. Hope that helps! Congrats on the little one."
babywearing,2bmuza,ouchmyback,8,Thu Jul 24 22:44:10 2014 UTC,For that age the feet shouldn't be out. The sling should be a pocket and their legs should be in an m in there with them just for more security and stability and support.

babywearing,2bmuza,WA_mama2,2,Fri Jul 25 05:43:55 2014 UTC,"Medical professionals disagree with you.   Keep in mind that OPs baby is not a month old yet.    During the first few months of life the ball is more likely to be loose within the socket because babies are naturally flexible and because the edges of the socket are made of soft cartilage like the cartilage in the ear. If the hips are forced into a stretched-out position too early, the ball is at risk of permanently deforming the edges of the cup shaped socket (hip dysplasia) or gradually slipping out of the socket altogether (hip dislocation). Hip dysplasia or dislocation in babies is not painful so this may go undetected until walking age and may also result in painful arthritis during adulthood. The risk of hip dysplasia or dislocation is greatest in the first few months of life.   I find I really disconcerting that you are spreading inaccurate and potentially harmful information to people who think you know what you're talking about."

babywearing,2bnkxu,VerityButterfly,2,Fri Jul 25 02:08:09 2014 UTC,"For a newborn I'd recommend using the FWCC over the FCC, because the FCC doesn't have a horizontal wrap for baby's head support. Also, it's easier ;-)  With the FWCC you can keep track of the top and bottom this way:  After you have the wrap around you (horizontal wrap on the front, cross on the back and tails over the shoulders), you grab the rail of the wrap which is closest to your neck from one of the shoulder tails, and the top rail of the horizontal wrap, then you tug on these to feel if it's the same rail. If not, the wrap is twisted (probably on your back) and you need to untwist it. Repeat on the other shoulder, then do the same with the outer rail on your shoulders and bottom on the front."

Although I will say that 6 weeks seems pretty young for a Mei Tai. It might be worth it to work on your wrap techniques with the Moby until he's a little bigger. It can take a few tries to get it down.

I didn't have any issues with her sliding down, and she was much happier.  Here's a video on the front wrap cross carry.  She's using a woven, but I used the same technique with the Moby.  It's hard to figure out exactly how tight to pull it with a stretchy, but you'll find it with a little practice.  I found that it was better to pull a little tighter than I thought I needed to.

Babe is so weightless it's amazing especially now at almost 10 months.  Mei Tais are quick like a SSC but are more comfy like a woven.  Have you looked into a ring sling?

I was able to make mine from 6 yards of linen fabric which I then dyed and have washed, ironed and braided for softness. I am planning on buying a kokadi woven (almost 200$) this Christmas for more elaborate carries and a nice wrap for events. I love it that much but it does take practice. My ring sling immediately caused issues with my shoulder but I loved how quick it was. Even with him being 15+ lbs I still adore the stretchy wrap for bed time since it's almost as effective as nursing him I put him to sleep."
babywearing,2bl79i,solongandthanks42,1 point,Thu Jul 24 14:23:31 2014 UTC,Why not have both? ;) Tula makes ssc's out of the woven wraps. I love them because I get the pretty wraps in ssc version. It's addictive though...
babywearing,2bl79i,memmab,1 point,Thu Jul 24 14:58:19 2014 UTC,"Why not a mix? :) I think as far as longevity goes, a good woven or SSC can definitely last through toddlerhood. I think a mei tai is more like an SSC with ties instead of buckles. I am personally loving my Babyhawk mei tai. I think I am just not a buckle person.  For quick in's and out's around the house I would actually recommend a ring sling."
babywearing,2bl79i,not-a-cylon,1 point,Thu Jul 24 15:04:33 2014 UTC,"I have both an Infantino Mei Tai and an Ergo.  The Mei Tai is ""like a wrap"" in that you actually have to tie the straps, but otherwise nothing like a wrap.  Some might say that wraps are the most versatile, but realistically you're going to be carrying your baby on your front, back, or hip.  The Ergo and the mei tai can both do all of those.  I reach for my Ergo the most, with the Mei Tai being my ""oh crap, husband took my car and only pulled out the car seat, not the rest of my stuff"" backup carrier.  I also like it when someone else wants to wear her, because they don't screw up my straps on the Ergo.  I have found the Mei Tai to be not as comfortable for back carries, but that might be a lack of practice tying it in a back carry configuration.  Since I've usually got the Ergo on hand I haven't bothered to work on that skill."
babywearing,2bl79i,5six7eight,1 point,Thu Jul 24 15:40:43 2014 UTC,"I have a Boba 3G, a Solly Wrap (stretchy wrap), and a ring sling made by a small company, so I would consider this homemade.  We have used the Boba from day one and we love it! This is the easiest to use when she is sleeping. She is 10 months and we still use this. This is also what my SO wears.   Solly wrap, this was good for me to get the baby to sleep, and when I didn't want to wear the Boba. I stopped using this at 7 months as I want to use this wrap for baby #2 and didn't want to stretch it out.  I didn't get the ring sling until my LO was 9 months. The Boba only does front and back (she's too small for the back still) and I wanted a hip carry. My ring sling has become my favorite go to for when my daughter is awake and we are in crowded areas. She loves being close to me, but loves that she can see out.   Play with multiple options! I opted for a cheaper ring sling until I knew my daughter liked it.   On my future purchase list is a more quality ring sling and eventually a Tula pack!"
babywearing,2bl79i,peaceandkim,1 point,Thu Jul 24 21:23:13 2014 UTC,"I imagine that for your situation, a SSC would be best for those ""oh crap she's awake and screaming and the water is boiling over"" situations.   I think as long as the back of say, an Ergo, hits the back of your baby's head so to provide enough neck support, that may be worth your buck. They are quite expensive but we still use ours with our 2.5 y/o w/ no end in sight really. The key is ergonomics obviously, so give a SSC a try. If she's big enough to sit in it, it may be your best bet.  I've only had experience w/ Ergo. I think it's all about aesthetic preference, they all seem to work relatively the same.   Edit: missed the part about her weight, could be too small for the SSC yet, Ergo makes an infant insert but from what I hear, it's not worth it."
babywearing,2bieet,BabyBad,3,Wed Jul 23 17:08:02 2014 UTC,"At 6 weeks you are doing the best thing for her development by keeping her close to you.  The time out sounds appropriate and if she's happy in the Ergo, let her stay there!  She will stop wanting to be up all the time as she gets more mobile and her eating gets better (the vomiting sound terrible, I'm sorry!).  Some babies just need this, it's totally ok."
babywearing,2bieet,annielane,1 point,Wed Jul 23 17:35:31 2014 UTC,"I'm happy that this seems to be the the answer. If she's happy, then I'm happy.

Looks like from what others have said, motor skills don't seem to be hindered by this, and I get to snuggle my calm cute baby all day."

A few months later, and her head and neck strength were much superior to other babies her age.  She came to enjoy time on the floor more and now at 6 months old, she's about to crawl any minute now.  Keep doing what works."
babywearing,2bieet,lizbethef,2,Wed Jul 23 17:39:59 2014 UTC,"This makes me happy. I have noticed lately that she will pull her head forward (all by herself) and bury it into my chest. I don't know why she loves it so much, but she can't breathe for long that way so I have to lean her back to get her face free. Last week it was easy, but this week, she's getting stronger and stronger. It's almost to the point that gravity won't work for much longer and I'll have to pull her off. Her tummy time head control is still low, but it may be that she hates to be on the floor. If I have her on my shoulder to burp her, she can lift her head and look around. Hopefully I'm raising a strong baby!"
babywearing,2bieet,MonsoonAndStone,2,Thu Jul 24 08:46:30 2014 UTC,"I did the same with mine, but in a Moby, since it was warmer and she was a winter baby. And let me tell you, she is the happiest, most adventurous, delightful 9 month old I've ever known. Seriously, I'm not just saying that because she's my daughter. My grandma had several weird sayings about babies, one of them being ""the less they cry, the less they cry"", meaning that the more you do to respond to/prevent their crying, the more they learn that crying isn't necessary to get what they need-so they do less of it. I loosely practice AP, but mama, if it's working for your baby then it's working for your baby! Don't fix what ain't broke!"

I don't have family around so I don't have to deal with the usual old school criticism of spoiling my baby because I hold her too much, or because I go to her as soon as I hear her about to cry. It breaks my heart when she's in distress and as her mother, I will do anything I can to make her happy and comfortable (hence the baby wearing for hours at a time)."

babywearing,2bieet,not-a-cylon,2,Wed Jul 23 23:48:13 2014 UTC,"Hell no. I absolutely believe babies who are worn learn more about the world around them than babies left in swings or play pens all the time. They get to interact with the world around them at an adults level and see a heck of a lot more than other babies at an earlier age. I honestly think it can help encourage curiosity and independence in babies for that very reason. Their brains are so ripe for simulation like that in those first few months, they just drink it all in.   I wore my toddler as an infant and her motor development was and still is above average at a way earlier age than her baby peers. :)"
babywearing,2bieet,memmab,1 point,Thu Jul 24 03:41:17 2014 UTC,"I do find it easier to interact with her while she's in her carrier.

You can also cheat a bit by taking the tail of the sling (or any piece of fabric) and rolling it in the top rail to create a little pillow, as shown in this video here: http://www.pinterest.com/pin/467881848758516165/  Make sure you familiarize yourself with the most important safety information too, especially when dealing with a preemie.

babywearing,2bbr8a,JuniorWick,7,Mon Jul 21 20:06:15 2014 UTC,We love our Ergo!  I think we stopped using the infant insert at around 3-4 months - it definitely depends on head control and comfort of your baby.  I actually still use the pillow of the insert under her bum to boost her view a little.    We traveled internationally when she was 5 months old - the Ergo saved our tails.
babywearing,2bbr8a,tercerero,1 point,Mon Jul 21 20:13:21 2014 UTC,Thanks for the input! Maybe I'll crack open the Ergo and give it a whirl!
babywearing,2bbr8a,msuaussiemom,2,Mon Jul 21 20:22:51 2014 UTC,"I started using the ergo at 4 weeks and never used the infant insert. Just roll up a receiving blanket and put it under the butt. I think there is a YouTube video for it.  As far as airport, that would be my suggestion. If the ring sling has metal rings (as most do) you will definitely have to take it off, and if for some reason they make you take off baby anyway, I find the ergo easiest and quickest."
babywearing,2bbr8a,MissLolaGranola,1 point,Mon Jul 21 21:05:28 2014 UTC,That's awesome to hear about the ergo. It honestly looks like I would be wrapping my baby up in a mattress with that insert! I'm gonna try it out tonight. Thanks!
babywearing,2bbr8a,icedroplets,3,Mon Jul 21 21:17:55 2014 UTC,"Ring Sling, hands down. My SO and I started traveling when my son was around 8 weeks old, and our ring sling has been a lifesaver. It's very quick to get them in and out of, extremely comfortable, works great as a nursing cover, and is incredibly compact (I just stick it in my purse). I actually used mine as a blanket for him a few times when the cabin got a little colder than i'd anticipated. Even now at 16 months, we never ever travel without it."
babywearing,2bbr8a,carnivorous_plant,1 point,Mon Jul 21 21:10:42 2014 UTC,Hmm - all good points.  Thanks for your thoughts!
babywearing,2bbr8a,anniczka,3,Mon Jul 21 21:17:04 2014 UTC,I LOVE traveling with my mei tai. It folds up smaller than an ergo and doesn't have metal on it (so they will be more likely to let you wear through security). Its also faster than a woven.
babywearing,2bbr8a,snailrabbitflamingo,3,Mon Jul 21 22:41:46 2014 UTC,"I've been travelling a lot lately and always wear the baby in the Ergo through security. They never ask me to take him out of it. If there are full body scanners, we don't go through them, and my hands are swabbed. If there are metal detectors, we go through those.  Wear slip-on shoes that you can take on and off while babywearing."
babywearing,2bbr8a,SillyJane,2,Tue Jul 22 00:24:10 2014 UTC,Seconding this! I used the Ergo at 7 months and they didn't make me take my shoes off or take him out of the carrier. I only got the hand swab on the way out (no scan or metal detector) and then on the return flight went through the regular metal detector.
babywearing,2bbr8a,spotlesssunshine,2,Tue Jul 22 18:28:10 2014 UTC,"I flew with an older baby, and really liked the convenience of my SSC (Babies Beyond Border, full-buckle). It is very similar to the Ergo.  I did take my ring sling as a back-up and did use it on the trip, but not during travel days. It was easier to have a two-shoulder carry with all the luggage handling I had to do.  I had no problems going through security. I never had to take him off. At one security checkpoint I had to have my hands swiped for residue. And I did have to dump his bottle of water at one point.  One bit of advice, if you wear a jacket, put it on over the carrier & baby. If it's under, they may very well make you take baby off in order to get your jacket off. And wear shoes easy to get on and off. Trying to tie shoes with baby in your face isn't easy :-)"
babywearing,2bbr8a,WA_mama2,2,Tue Jul 22 00:41:18 2014 UTC,"Honestly, use what you and baby are most comfortable with and maybe a backup that can be packed compactly in your carryon. I flew by myself with M at 6 months and used the ergo, but brought the k'tan as backup because M liked looking outward. What I found most useful- wear yoga pants or something with a stretchy waist band so you can hold baby and pee. Might not be applicable if someone else is flying with you, but still worth a thought."
babywearing,2bbr8a,aevulto,2,Tue Jul 22 03:56:45 2014 UTC,"I would definitely say the ergo too, it's the most supportive and easy to get in and out of. I can get my LO out and into his crib without waking him up. It also doesn't have any metal (not that rings would necessarily set anything off). And I would definitely say if his head control is fine then there's no need for the infant insert."
babywearing,2bbr8a,merriment_,1 point,Tue Jul 22 06:05:51 2014 UTC,"Any thing you can half wear (waist belt, like on the Ergo or Mei Tai) while you're not wearing baby will make things easier because you just pick baby up and pull the carrier into place."

babywearing,2b6bfu,WA_mama2,1 point,Sun Jul 20 04:37:03 2014 UTC,"Yes, that does sound easy! I wonder if this approach would work with wraps too? Just tie it on beforehand and then pop the baby in? I haven't tried any wraps so not sure how much adjusting you usually have to do once baby is in."
babywearing,2b6bfu,Meilikah,3,Sun Jul 20 12:47:25 2014 UTC,cannot do that with wraps in general. At least not when they are big. I know you can with infants in a moby but normal wraps not so sure. A ring sling is the quick up and down I hear most.
babywearing,2b6bfu,Flewtea,3,Mon Jul 21 00:04:35 2014 UTC,"You put baby in any carrier before you go outside and make sure you're all bundled up and comfy. If you need to adjust, go back inside. For things like grocery shopping, I carried her in and put her in the carrier once in the store if it was extremely cold.   You would have to be very lucky indeed to get both a good-quality SSC and wrap for $150. If you decide on an SSC, look into the Lillebaby. No infant insert needed and quite comfy."
babywearing,2b6bfu,Flewtea,1 point,Sun Jul 20 01:32:06 2014 UTC,"Ah, good tips. I can see where it would be easier to just run into the store vs. trying to fumble around in the backseat of the car or something.  Not $150 for both; $150 for each one. That's probably doable, right? crosses fingers??  Yes, the infant insert thing is something I'm unsure about with the Ergo. It would be nice to find a carrier that doesn't require it!"
babywearing,2b6bfu,birdsaregross,2,Sun Jul 20 01:44:36 2014 UTC,"Oh, yes, definitely! We got our Lillebaby for $130 and $170 should be fine for a good wrap. There are other carriers that don't need an infant insert but last time I looked, they all either had lower weight limits than Lillebaby or were more expensive or couldn't do as many carries."

babywearing,2b5oaq,ouchmyback,2,Sat Jul 19 21:15:07 2014 UTC,"I haven't used a Moby before but I believe it's a ""poppable"" carry, so just do it up at home and drive with it on if you're worried about the tails.  I've also heard from another mama, if she is going to the grocery store or mall (and it's raining) she'll carry her woven wrap & her kiddo to an undercover area and wrap there.  Also wraps are meant to be used as another person said, you can always wash it."

I would recommend a ring sling (I like my Maya wrap with padded shoulder) for outings and quick trips out if you're into investing in another carrier option. It's sooo much more portable and quick to use."

They are giving you information that directly contradicts with what medical professionals say.    During the first few months of life the ball is more likely to be loose within the socket because babies are naturally flexible and because the edges of the socket are made of soft cartilage like the cartilage in the ear. If the hips are forced into a stretched-out position too early, the ball is at risk of permanently deforming the edges of the cup shaped socket (hip dysplasia) or gradually slipping out of the socket altogether (hip dislocation). Hip dysplasia or dislocation in babies is not painful so this may go undetected until walking age and may also result in painful arthritis during adulthood. The risk of hip dysplasia or dislocation is greatest in the first few months of life."

babywearing,2ap3ia,sooza22,1 point,Tue Jul 15 02:41:58 2014 UTC,"A ring sling will last you longer if that is at all a concern of yours. What is important for the RS is to get one that is high quality, as it will be sturdier and give you more support. I personally own a Maya and it is nice and comfortable. I have hard good things about Sakura Bloom but don't have personal experience with them.   While RS's and stretchy wraps are great for newborns, but if long-term comfort is your main concern, you may want to look into some other types of carrier types, such as mei tais or a good soft structured carrier. I know you are wanting something from your local store because it's on sale, but just something to think about."

The trick I found w it is to have the rings in the right position and the back evenly spread out across the back n I can carry for a good 45-60mins but for long walks etc I much prefer a woven wrap.

babywearing,2ag592,sweetlime13,3,Fri Jul 11 18:42:48 2014 UTC,"I would totally wear baby.  I had a January baby albeit in the ""winter"" in FL, and she kept me toasty.  On top of that, I didn't have to push a stroller in snow (although I wouldn't have to anyway!).    Just wear your coat over, keep baby's head covered, and you'll be fine."
babywearing,2ag592,tercerero,3,Fri Jul 11 18:53:06 2014 UTC,"I'm also in Canada and found it much easier to keep my babies warm while wearing them by wearing them under my coat.  There are a few different methods.  You can get a coat made especially for babywearing (M-coat is one brand) or you can get or make a panel that zips into your existing winter coat (there are several brands of those as well).  My method was to dress my baby in what I was wearing (usually long sleeved shirt, pants, socks, booties, mittens and hat) then I got a longish coat that was big enough for both of us with room to grow (about 2-3 sizes too large).  I'd put her in a carrier on my front and then zip the coat up over both of us until it was just to about the base of her neck.  I'd usually have a short scarf that I could use to block the wind if necessary without actually covering her face.  If it was especially frigid, I'd add a fleece layer to her and me or tuck a blanket in around her over the carrier.  When they were old enough to be carried on my back, I ""frankensteined"" that coat to have an opening on the back so I could put it over both of us and take it off inside stores.  I never had the chance, but would have loved to try an Amautik, which is an Inuit babywearing coat that works as a carrier and coat all at once."

babywearing,2a0f9u,troublewithphysics,18,Mon Jul 7 01:26:56 2014 UTC,How about no adult would fall flat on their chest. You might stumble but the baby wouldn't fall out. In addition strollers can roll away. I think this has a bit more to do with control than safety.
babywearing,2a0f9u,troublewithphysics,-1,Mon Jul 7 02:18:50 2014 UTC,"I don't think he's worried about him falling out as much as him being confined to me and being crushed. His argument to the stroller rolling away is that the stroller has brakes, or wheel locks."
babywearing,2a0f9u,doriangreypants,8,Mon Jul 7 02:24:28 2014 UTC,Anxiety can be illogical. There's lots of other things to be worried about so I would just present all the benefits. The extreme negatives of a certain decision will always be present and if those extremes prevent you from doing what you think is best then you're making fear a priority. There's nothing wrong with fear making choices for you but you have to know that it's an irrational choice.
babywearing,2a0f9u,Avikingprincess,9,Mon Jul 7 02:32:38 2014 UTC,"'Let you'?  Who put him in charge of what you can do, first of all?    Second, I fell over when a plastic lawn chair on uneven grass collapsed under me while wearing baby in a moby.  I was able to catch myself with my hands and baby didn't even wake up.  If he had just been in my arms i might have dropped him or one of us could have been hurt."
babywearing,2a0f9u,djensen,6,Tue Jul 8 15:46:49 2014 UTC,"Tell him by that logic you are just as likely to fall and squish him by just holding him so no one can pick him up, or hold him, or walk or do any of that anymore either. IMHO, nothing is more dangerous then a slippery wet baby after a bath but we still bathe them, right? I have worn babies for six years and have never, ever dropped either of my kids. I would rather have them quiet and happy in a carrier then crying in a bulky stroller. I even climbed a 252 foot tall Pilgrim Monument with a baby on my back. Kid loved it. Cant do that with a stroller. And keep in mind that strollers can tip over and roll away. They can get clipped by passing vehicles. Honestly, shit happens, you can't bubble wrap babies, even if you want to keep them safe. Sounds to me like your boyfriend is just anxious and wants the familiar socially ""normal"" stroller to make himself feel better about his baby safety angst. You might have to just be stubborn on this point."
babywearing,2a0f9u,SugarandSass,5,Mon Jul 7 13:38:46 2014 UTC,When falling your instinct is to put out your hands. If you fall without carrying you'd drop your baby versus having your baby attached to you. Tell him to look up statistics on baby wearing injuries versus stroller injuries. The burden of proof is on him. Keep wearing until he convinces you it isn't safe.
babywearing,2a0f9u,iheartbrainz,2,Wed Jul 9 16:35:13 2014 UTC,"It seems like tripping while wearing baby in a carrier would be less dangerous than tripping while carrying the baby in your arms, since you'd have your hands free to catch yourself if you wore the baby. I've never heard someone argue against carrying your own baby, so that's probably an argument worth presenting."

If at all possible I'd find a babywearing meetup in your area to feel a few, but for a first woven it's hard to go wrong with straight cotton.  Also, check out Babywearing Faith and Wrapping Rachel on YouTube to get familiar with different carries. The Front Wrap Cross Carry (FWCC) should look familiar, but I'd recommend the Front Cross Carry (FCC) or a Rebozo for your trip."
babywearing,2a0kw0,kaceface,1 point,Mon Jul 7 05:09:26 2014 UTC,Good god. Does the Ellevill wrap fold out into a studio apartment? That thing costs more than my plane ticket for this vacation.
babywearing,2a0kw0,HnyBny,1 point,Mon Jul 7 16:45:43 2014 UTC,"Wraps can get very expensive very fast! You should see what some Uppymamma wraps go for used! (But if it helps the Ellevill site has all prices in Kronor, not the US Dollar)  Think of wraps like shoes. Some people have one pair from Payless that they use and love everyday. Others have a whole closet of $$$$ shoes. It all depends on your budget and how you use your wraps."
babywearing,2a0kw0,goddesspyxy,2,Mon Jul 7 17:32:47 2014 UTC,"You can find budget options in the Facebook group ""babywearing on a budget"". ""the babywearing swap"" also has an album for items under $100.   Didymos is a great brand but can be a little overwhelming simply because they offer so many options. My first wrap was a Colimacon & Cie (also called C&C), which was a good starter wrap and a good price. Pavo is a very popular brand, and their stripes and hearts wraps are beginner-friendly. If you search for Pavo Form, they usually have some in stock. I also like my Natibaby quite a bit, but it's on the thicker side. I believe the newer ones are thinner, which would be easier for a beginner.   I personally have had a bad experience with the quality of a new Ellevill, but I think a used one would be fine because the current owner should disclose any issues."
babywearing,2a0kw0,snailrabbitflamingo,1 point,Sun Jul 13 01:52:00 2014 UTC,Ditto! I was shocked at the pricing of wovens when I first started but love the budget group and swap. There are also a lot of diy options if you are crafty!
babywearing,2a0kw0,WA_mama2,1 point,Sun Jul 13 02:57:58 2014 UTC,"What are you looking for? Something similar to the moby but more supportive would be a woven wrap. If you want something that can be thrown on more quickly you might try a soft structured carrier. I personally have a mei tai and really like it - it's easier than a wrap IMO,  but more comfortable and adjustable than an SSC."

babywearing,29svtj,PirateZero,6,Fri Jul 4 04:24:49 2014 UTC,"You wanna be frugal? Do what I do:  Go to slingrings.com and buy a pair of large metal rings (they have nylon, but those are better for slippery fabrics). They are cheap, ship fast and are what Maya Ring Slings use.  Then go to your local fabric store and grab some nice organic (or not) cotton (or linen or cotton-poly blend) and get 2.25-2.5 yards or the stuff. I picked up a cute chevron pattern solid for $7 on sale at Joann's for a friends sling yesterday. Try to aim for bolts that are 36-45"" wide cause you don't have to cut those up.  Then just thread both ends through the sling. No sewing required: http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WJHV_yFxRoI  You can finish the ends if you want. I got a green linen fabric for my most used sling and the little bit of fraying seems to go with the sling... Very granola but I don't mind it.  Quick, easy, cheap. :)"

babywearing,29svtj,wishitwasepic,1 point,Fri Jul 4 04:55:38 2014 UTC,"I think this is a great idea! Rings slings are the best with new borns, and easiest to bf in. I would suggest linen. Its structured enough so that you can continue to use as the get older. Also once you find you love it, you can sew it really easily. Thats what I did."
babywearing,29svtj,merveilleuse_,2,Fri Jul 4 15:56:26 2014 UTC,"I've made my own ring sling, too, and it can be a really affordable way to try it out, just make sure that you buy a nice strong fabric.  Typically, quilting cottons are NOT strong enough to use, and if they get a hole in them, they tear easily.  For a newborn, the weight of the fabric  is probably less of a concern, but if you plan on using it as your baby grows, please be very careful about the fabric you choose.  This link has great info about what fabric can work, and how to choose suitable fabric. http://www.sleepingbaby.net/jan/Baby/fabric.html"
babywearing,29svtj,ethereal_pixie,2,Fri Jul 4 05:47:02 2014 UTC,"Crinkle cotton is suggested for a lightweight sling / wrap, other than that bottom weight cottons or linens are the best for wearing - especially sliding through those rings 20x a day."

I did cut off the pocket and hem the edge because while it seems like a great idea, the pocket-tail on the Maya is too long. It gets caught between my legs and drags in everything. Now it wears like a much pricier sakura bloom."

Our girl went through about a month where she was too big for the infant insert and too small without it.  It was annoying.  I took to wrapping up a blanket to pad her bum.    Give it some time perhaps.  I have a couple carriers that seemed ripe for chucking at first, but now they get some use as the girl grows into them."
babywearing,29o74z,tercerero,1 point,Wed Jul 2 18:49:18 2014 UTC,"How heavy/old is your baby? With my BB2 I found the infant insert velcro didn't really accommodate (was too small for) my baby before the 7kg/15lb recommendation for discontinuing use. But for the infant insert the shoulders don't need to be in the internal infant harness. That said I found my BB2 stopped fitting right around 12-13 months...and I swapped to a Boba 4G which I'm still using at 21 months. My daughter isn't that big. Has been around 20 lbs for months.  I really liked the BB2 for the easy back carries of littler babies (very handy with an older toddler to deal with), otherwise I think I would unload mine as well (except it's discontinued so I can't get another one as easily)."
babywearing,29o74z,I3km,1 point,Thu Jul 3 07:49:23 2014 UTC,He is around 14lbs at 8 weeks.    So the infant shoulder straps don't need to go over his shoulders?
babywearing,29o74z,I3km,1 point,Thu Jul 3 18:08:58 2014 UTC,"Nope, they can go under or where ever. The infant insert is there to lift him up enough to his head isn't buried in the carrier."
babywearing,29mpzo,icanhascake,5,Wed Jul 2 06:21:23 2014 UTC,He really shouldn't be slumped. I'm guessing the shoulder straps aren't tight enough. The fit should really be quite snug. There are a lot of fitting videos on YouTube. I definitely agree with the previous comment of trying it when he's tired already and needing to stay relaxed too.

babywearing,29mpzo,tercerero,3,Wed Jul 2 13:04:00 2014 UTC,"I would try using it initially when he's sleepy, so he's a little more relaxed.  Also, it's really important for you to feel relaxed and confident in it; he can sense any hesitation on your part and will react to that.    It takes some repeated use to get comfortable, so just keep at it - five minutes here, ten minutes there."
babywearing,29mpzo,tercerero,1 point,Wed Jul 2 10:57:55 2014 UTC,"Good idea, I'll keep practicing. Do you find their head bobs around a lot when you walk? He has good head control, but he wants to look at everything instead of relaxing and I wonder if it's hard on his neck."
babywearing,29mpzo,jlynnbizatch,3,Wed Jul 2 11:02:45 2014 UTC,"We've been using the Ergo since pretty much day one, so I feel like the girl's head control/neck muscles are super strong as a result.  Her head doesn't bob much now.  But yes, it did for a time.  If it's too hard, she would lay her head down, and your boy will probably do the same.  I'm sure he's really excited to have a new perspective - imagine if you were suddenly five feet taller!"

I did an ice dye on it and it took the dye well and I love how it came out.  The only thing I would do differently is use Dharma dye instead of Dylon because it did fade a bit and I've seen that Dharma's stick better than Dylon or Tulip.

babywearing,29cqim,jordah,2,Sun Jun 29 01:03:42 2014 UTC,"All I was going to say is to make sure that it's spread widely over your back, and that you pull more of the fabric up her front to make a deeper seat. You can do that by leaning forward and pulling the fabric up between her legs.  That should also smooth out the fabric across her back. :)"

babywearing,29cqim,MamaJay,1 point,Sun Jun 29 14:12:25 2014 UTC,"If it feels comfortable to you, and the baby isn't fussing, it's probably correct.  You do want the fabric on your shoulder to be cupping your entire shoulder so the weight of the baby isn't resting on your neck."

My husband and I tried a manduca and a tula on at a sling meet and they were both very similar. 10/10 would recommend the tula. I have become one of the tula cult. I hardly use my large expensive pushchair anymore. It's super easy to put on, even back carries by myself. Shitty baby in the witching hour? Back carry! And he's instantly calm. He's always calm in the supermarket and anywhere. My tall husband loves it too, he asks to go on long walks on the weekend so he can carry him. A lillebaby looks just as supportive.

I find ours so comfortable and easy to use.  I personally don't like the idea of forward facing carriers as they aren't completely ergonomic on the back but that's a very personal preference. Tula can't do that though if that's a reason you're looking at the lilebaby.

I still can't transfer sleeping baby from carrier to crib without waking her up, which was a skill I mastered in the Beco, but I prefer the Tula to the Beco in every other respect. It's comfortable for us both, it's quick, it's cooler in this escalating Texas heat, and the little pocket for my keys has come in handy like a million times already.

babywearing,296got,VerityButterfly,1 point,Fri Jun 27 13:40:02 2014 UTC,Try tightening it more before you put it on. It sounds like you might be adjusting it too much after it's on. Ring slings generally need minimal adjusting.

babywearing,295fg0,angeluray,1 point,Thu Jun 26 18:32:01 2014 UTC,No not any more so than any other wrap. I find that when you live and Florida and strap a 20 lb human to yourself it's going to be warm.   We like a soft structured carrier for the summer (and for the constant up down with A toddler) I'm in love with my tula.   But for sick days or cooler days we love to wrap- our KOkadi 100% cotton is great. I almost bought the ellaroo just like the one I learned with but went with one I liked the pattern on more. It is a nice budget friendly wrap.

They have a budget album and sized albums.   I have a friend that swears by the wrapsody breeze, but her wrap was waaaaaay too long for me. I also don't really care for their prints.  They are very well loved by most of the BW groups I'm in. The same is true of the Ellaroos."
babywearing,295fg0,kaceface,2,Thu Jun 26 14:45:06 2014 UTC,"Thanks! I'm a big woman (6'1"" and wearing a size 24) and I'm looking for a nice long wrap so I can feel confident with a little extra fabric to wrap.  my biggest concern is that the Wrapsody isn't strong enough."
babywearing,2938o8,bumblemom0503,2,Wed Jun 25 20:34:37 2014 UTC,I'm only 4 months along so not very big yet. My LO likes back carries in the Ergo and I have found that as long as the belt is above my bump it's plenty comfortable for now. I have also seen at least one video of a mom wrapping her older child (also a back carry) on her due date.  I'm mobile now but I'll try to update with the video later.
babywearing,2938o8,5six7eight,1 point,Wed Jun 25 20:56:01 2014 UTC,The issue is that baby doesn't like the wrap most of the time. I know someone who would buckle her ergo under her belly for back carrying but I have a long torso and baby will be too low that way. So I'm hoping above my bump will work. I have a stroller but I'll be big in winter and I'd rather wear her for warmth.
babywearing,2938o8,2ndstartotheright,1 point,Wed Jun 25 21:37:14 2014 UTC,"I used a wrap conversion mei tai, and was able to do back carries, but honestly just wore toddler above the bump in front most of the time.

babywearing,2938o8,ShannonOh,1 point,Thu Jun 26 03:25:45 2014 UTC,Awesome thanks. Because of my long torso I tend to have a fairly low belly when I'm pregnant. I'm hoping that'll help for when I'm needing to buckle it above the bump.

I didn't get the sewing gene, so I just tried to achieve the same effect by putting naked baby under a really loose-necked nursing top and securing him in my K'tan over the shirt. Totally worked.   I bet you could do the same with any wrap or carrier that would accommodate a froggy position as long as the shirt is big enough not to ride up too much. I know that's not the same as this awesome garment, but I'm cheap :)"

I am a huge fan of my Babyhawk Mei Tai. I tried a friends infantino and don't think that fabric would hold up as well to heavier weights as baby gets older. Supportive fabric is a must, so I would probably look for a used Babyhawk before I would go for an Infantino. Ring slings are also wonderful, I have a maya and a sakura bloom. I highly recommend the maya for beginners. You can usually get them for fairly cheap at swap meets or on craigslist."

babywearing,28ke2z,angeluray,1 point,Fri Jun 20 01:06:55 2014 UTC,I made my wrap myself but it's about 5 meters or a size 7.  I can't do any carries that wrap around my midsection first because it takes up so much fabric. I figured these might be possible if they have a ring finish and not a tie.
babywearing,28ke2z,kaceface,1 point,Fri Jun 20 11:34:41 2014 UTC,Try a kangaroo carry- it worked while I was bigger- and maybe a front cross carry I was able to do that with a 7. If you are looking for a back carry a ruck is pretty nice and I could do it with a 7. You could also look up a rebozo.  I love www.wrapyourbaby.com

Because SSC's have more padding at the waist and shoulders I was more comfortable wearing her for longer periods of time, although it did take some getting used to for both of us. The best part was my son, her twin, loved being worn! For the first time in his short little life he wanted to be worn.

I think you should probably be able to find some kind of hold for your wrapsody that would give similar freedom of movement.   Now that my son is one year old, and the Ergo is the best thing for us. It's so over-engineered looking compared to wraps, but it does make carrying 30 pounds of toddler comfortable!"

babywearing,27ihh2,ishouldnotbeonreddit,2,Fri Jun 13 14:06:29 2014 UTC,"Im no expert, but with our ergo (regular model but very similar) and my nine month old, it's similar. I think there is no need for constant head support (she can hold up her head well if she wants to--being silly is another story) but it can be a problem if she falls asleep. The way I would fix it would be to actually raise the waist belt. This way her head is between the shoulder blades where the back naturally curves forward a bit and she can nestle it in there.   I try to move off of my back if her head is flopping around while she sleeps."
babywearing,27ihh2,taddymama,4,Sat Jun 7 00:59:52 2014 UTC,"When my LO falls asleep in it, I snap the rain hood on; I just have to make sure it's out before I put him in it, in preparation."

babywearing,27ihh2,golden_girl_travelin,2,Sun Jun 8 04:26:08 2014 UTC,"From what I read on the ergo instructions and stuff, baby's head should be about shoulder level, so if you turn your head you should see baby.  So, you might want to make sure your LO is a bit higher.  That might help with the ability to lay down her head.  This site has some good pictures."

As far as the strap length, different companies can have different lengths and some you can custom order. If the straps are too short you can tie under the baby's butt instead of taking it behind your back. Search YouTube for videos of different ways to tie it."

Although the buckles are still really tight, which isn't an all bad thing. We through ours in the wash once every couple of months which has probably helped soften the straps a bit too. You may also want to try either putting your waist strap a little higher or let your shoulders out a tad and see if that helps the issue. I wear my waist a little high and find it easier and more comfortable to wear with my 2 year old."

babywearing,278kz6,am1986,3,Tue Jun 3 21:44:07 2014 UTC,"Omg, in the UK you can get all the awesome woven wraps that don't ship to the US anymore! Woven wraps have a higher learning curve, but they are a lot more versatile than soft structured carriers. They are good for all ages especially if you get a blended fiber content (bamboo or linen esp) that is extra strong for toddlers. You will spend more, but it could be your only carrier. Being on the small side, you could get away with a 4.2 or 4.6 meter wrap which will save you a little money. (I'm the same height as you and my friend talked me into buying her wrap which was 5.2 meters and it's just waaaay too much fabric).  Little Frog is a Polish company that has decent prices. Natibaby has lovely quality and prints but they are more expensive.   If you do go the DIY onsaburg route, make sure you use French seams. Most online tutorials will talk about it."

babywearing,278kz6,missushooligan,2,Wed Jun 4 14:09:43 2014 UTC,I am in the US so we might have different brands. For ease of use I like soft structured carriers also known as buckle carriers. Common ones seen in the US are Tula Ergo Boba.  I know Manduca is one that is European. They can be used from newborn to preschool years. I have a small 5 year old I can still wear in one. They work for front and back carriers. All are hands free. They all fit slightly different so it might take some hands on use to find the one you fit best.

I would recommend a woven wrap - I find them to be cooler than stretchies, and they last longer, so you don't have to get another in a few months. I also haven't made one, but I've heard of people using onsaburg (?) fabric, or linen, which is very strong and cooler. If you Google, I'm sure you can find tons of info. Good luck!"
babywearing,2715jl,lambeekins,4,Sun Jun 1 17:41:23 2014 UTC,"Baby K'tan all the way! It's stretchy so it will hold him close, but it's not as much fabric to deal with as a moby wrap. They also make them in a more breathable fabric, I think it's called ""breeze"" maybe, for warm weather. I used this all the time with my baby until the ergo worked."
babywearing,2715jl,sooza22,2,Sun Jun 1 18:34:31 2014 UTC,"I've only ever used a streachy wrap so I cant tell you if its better or worse than the firmer ones. However, I think it would fit your needs. Baby can be secure but also easy to put in and take out.  Also, if you're near a walmart that sells fabric, I found some jersey knit there for $1 a yard. Get 5 yards, cut in half long ways. Then fold in half again long ways and boom you have 2 wraps for $5. Handy in case one gets vomited all over :D"
babywearing,2715jl,anthamay,2,Sun Jun 1 16:57:54 2014 UTC,"I used a Mei Tai carrier with my daughter since she was about 7 lbs or so (my twins were tiny preemies so we didn't babywear immediately). We both loved it until she started getting to big for the front carry, then we upgraded to a SSC (like your Ergo). I bought a woven Mei Tai off of Etsy and it was great for keeping us cool since we live in a warm humid climate. Mei Tai's are also great for newborns because you can roll up the waist as much as you need to fit the baby correctly."
babywearing,2715jl,PreposterousMurmur,2,Sun Jun 1 19:05:39 2014 UTC,"I haven't used a wrap, but I am a huge fan of mei tais. I used one from 3 weeks on, I just rolled up the waist and put a rolled up receiving blanket in the bottom. There are videos on youtube showing newborn modifications for mei tais. Anyway, the reason I'm a huge fan is that it is super hot where I live and the mei tai is still totally comfortable in the heat. I have the infantino one so it was really affordable too.   Carrying and lifting will be fine. Bending may be harder. I make sure to bend at the knees or if I really need to bend over, I instinctively hold the baby close with my other arm."
babywearing,2715jl,mogokara,2,Sun Jun 1 21:03:44 2014 UTC,"A stretchy wrap is fine for newborns but less awesome as the kids grow plus they can only be worn on the front- I would look a Tula or ergo - I think the Tula is more comfortable than the ergo and cooler than my woven wraps. the plus is it is a soft structured carrier so it is like a back pack- less layers wrapping you up in the summer especially when you already have a human heat source tied to your body.   Woven wraps are amazing and beautiful and comfortable, but do have a learning curve and can be expensive. I have one that is permanently in my stash a kokadi- it is so comfortable. In Florida I only grab these in winter or indoors because they are a bit warmer and cuddlier. Very perfect for a sick baby! :)   Living in Florida for summer or long out door days I always grab my Tula (the straps are way more comfortable than the ergo) and out the baby on my back. We have been back carrying since my 18 month old was about 3 months. I can bend, squat, climb, walk, and do anything I want or need with that silly monkey on my back, and she loves being up there! There is also a sun hood for when they fall asleep back there you can cover up their heads so they don't get too much sun and so their head is supported while you work."
babywearing,2715jl,angeluray,2,Mon Jun 2 02:00:26 2014 UTC,My baby loved my moby wrap it was the only carrier he'd stand every time. The Mai tai is hit or miss.

I have one osnaburg that is probably 5 yards that is really supportive but can get hot. I also made a cotton gauze one that is very light. Mine is shorter so I can't do as many different carries. It also tends to be a little less comfortable after awhile. It only cost me $13 to make though! My daughter is 10 months so it takes some muscle, but if you start carrying when they are small, you build up your strength! Especially when crouching down in the garden."

Friend of mine had a BB, even when her LO was tinier, she was much more able to look around and separate away from momma than mine could her in the Ergo.  I hope that makes sense...

babywearing,26w8rn,monkey_feather,2,Sat May 31 00:54:09 2014 UTC,She's not too young for a back carry if you're using a woven wrap! I started back carrying my son when he was about 8 weeks. A high back carry is perfect for little ones that love to look around. If budget is an issue you can make your own wrap with Osnaburg cotton from a fabric store. I made my first wrap for under $30.
babywearing,26w8rn,musicalkel88,1 point,Sat May 31 03:42:42 2014 UTC,Back carries can be safely introduced as soon as baby has enough neck strength to hold her head up for long periods. The reason being that your back doesn't provide good support for baby's head if she gets tired. A good rule of thumb is that once baby can sit up on her own she may be ready for back carries.

It also has a ""narrow seat"" option for this specially. She LOVES this, especially on my husband. I've talked it over with my PT friends, who agree that she's supported the right way.

babywearing,26mu1k,SugarandSass,2,Tue May 27 20:51:36 2014 UTC,"I watched so many videos, and just couldn't get it right! Do you remember which one worked for you? Thanks!"
babywearing,26mu1k,SugarandSass,2,Tue May 27 22:46:55 2014 UTC,"I used this one: http://youtu.be/Fg-eX1BqvjY  It beats around the bush a little because it talks about the differences between the new insert and the old one, but you just: lay the insert down on a bed or something with the opening in the front, unsnap the strap, lay your baby in it with their butt on the bottom and their feet in front of them in the frog leg position, tuck their feet into the little fabric edge at the front of the seat, close the strap, hold them up to your chest facing you, and then strap the rest of the carrier on over them! It's easier if you have the waist part already fastened, and even easier if you have help. :)"
babywearing,26mu1k,SugarandSass,2,Tue May 27 23:00:43 2014 UTC,"Thanks! Ill give it a whirl tomorrow!   I did try the Bjorn scarf hack at home earlier this evening and it worked. The carrier itself isn't that comfortable though since there's no waist/hip support, but I was able to keep his legs froggy'd, and he was happy."
babywearing,26mu1k,vjv100,2,Wed May 28 01:36:01 2014 UTC,"That's good! Hope you guys find something that's comfortable for both of you. I found the ergo pretty bulky since I have a small frame, but comfy since the weight was well distributed. Good luck!"
babywearing,26mu1k,spazzycakes,2,Wed May 28 01:40:19 2014 UTC,I just cinched the bottom of my ergo with some string and put my baby in. She was 7 weeks. You can try that...
babywearing,26mu1k,spazzycakes,2,Tue May 27 21:41:23 2014 UTC,"Wearing the waistband higher on your body can help as well. That makes up for a bit of the height difference, especially when  you can back carry."

babywearing,26mu1k,ludaachristyy,2,Tue May 27 22:46:09 2014 UTC,We didn't get the insert because we have big babies. I used prefolds in the bottom of the Ergo to position the baby for the first few weeks. Sorry that I can't be of more help!

babywearing,26hbwm,oinkpiggyoink,1 point,Mon May 26 03:49:15 2014 UTC,"Sorry for slow response! I'm still at the beach!  I used:  2.5 yards cotton gauze fabric from Joann's fabric  2 ea- 2"" rings from lowes hardware  Polyester thread  Most tutorials said to trim the width of the fabric down to 30-36 inches but it's really light fabric and I'm lazy so I left it (at 45"" I think.)  I did length wise accordion folds about 6"" wide. ( they only have to go down about a foot- not the whole length.).   Then I slipped my rings on and kept them at 6"" in.  Folded the fabric over, arranged it so it looked tidy, pinned it, then sewed three parallel lines of wide zig zag stitching to secure it, back stitching like a boss at the beginning and end of each row.   I loosely followed this tutorial: https://www.mayawrap.com/n_sewsling.php  I want to buy rings from sling rings.com but this was a very last minute project. I just wanted an easy way to lug baby to the beach and back to the rental while carrying all her gear too. The rings I got at lowes are smaller but on the plus side I know that sucker isn't going to slide an inch.   So far it's been great. Baby likes it a lot and we've been using it in the pool so she feels secure."
babywearing,26hbwm,ladymclamb,1 point,Tue May 27 01:58:50 2014 UTC,I just bought some gauze to make my own ringsling! Do you feel it's strong/supportive enough? I live by the beach so it's getting super hot these days. Was it breathable?   Very awesome sling and adorable baby!

It may say you can in the instructions but at that weight I think you'll have a terrible time keeping it tight enough to be safe. It's also never recommended to wear a child forward facing as it isn't ergonomically correct.  I'd look into a soft structured carrier, mei tei or non stretchy woven wrap. Good luck!"

babywearing,268bht,Chickadoolie,3,Thu May 22 19:08:54 2014 UTC,Do you have a local sling library? You could rent one for the day/week? Something like a buckles would be perfect like a tula or similar :)
babywearing,268bht,ittybittypittie,3,Thu May 22 19:15:51 2014 UTC,I didn't even know those existed! I found a local babywearing Facebook group. Maybe they know of a local sling library in my area.
babywearing,268bht,lisatlantic,3,Thu May 22 19:49:32 2014 UTC,The babywearing group will have q lending library of various carriers you can borrow.  Target or Amazon has an inexpensive mei tai from Infantino that is really nice.
babywearing,268bht,scratchresistorswife,3,Fri May 23 00:00:48 2014 UTC,Getting a sturdier carrier will make a world of difference! Infantino now makes reasonably priced mei tais and SSCs.
babywearing,268bht,SaltyDuchess,2,Thu May 22 19:16:42 2014 UTC,"Maybe try a ring sling? They can be cheap but tend to hold their value so you can sell it on. Baby can sit on your hip, back or front (on the hip would see more)  and can sleep in it too. They're easy to use and adjustable too. :-)"

babywearing,25z6h4,awholelotofbuns,5,Mon May 19 21:51:12 2014 UTC,I'd go with the Mei Tai. I live in Florida and have 6 different carriers. I use my ring slings and mei tai the most often.

babywearing,25z6h4,crazyfordisney,2,Tue May 20 18:21:47 2014 UTC,"From your choices and price range I would probably say Mei Tai could be your first port of call. The Boba Air is good for hot, but less comfortable than an actual Boba SSC. So if your Mei Tai has shoulder padding that might do well for you. The Moby is a beast in the summer, ugh. So almost anything will be cooler, but you will still have sweaty baby stuck up next to you. If price wasn't an issue as much I might recommend a Boba. I have a 4G and I'm pretty happy with it to the point I don't think I want any other carriers (though I have a fair few). I'm 5' and my husband is 5'10"" and we can both use it. I still use it on my 20 month old.  I would recommend anyone thinking about a ring sling to buy some ring sling rings (from http://www.slingrings.com/ or similar) and do a no sew ring sling with a spare piece of fabric 2-3 yards or longer (a single sheet is a good size)."

babywearing,25z6h4,MonsoonAndStone,1 point,Tue May 20 02:13:27 2014 UTC,"The Moby is super hot! I don't own an Infantino MT, but have tried one on and it's a great warm-weather option.  You're right that a linen RS would be even cooler, but if your husband is reluctant then the MT should be just fine.  You'll also likely find it comfortable for longer than you would a RS.  One other thing to consider is a gauze wrap (Babyette is a popular brand).  That's just about the coolest option on the market, though no less fiddly than the Moby."

Of special note is this sentence: ""Free movement of the hips without forcing them together promotes natural hip development.""  Until recently, the consensus in my local BW community was that it was okay to tuck a newborn's legs in. Then a few of our members took a babywearing educator certification course, which taught that tucking the legs in is currently not recommended at any age, and the ""froggy legs"" seat with legs out and knees higher than bum is always recommended."

babywearing,25xpsu,stpdlngnm,2,Mon May 19 12:29:30 2014 UTC,"We have used our Boba 3G's since our twins were a year old when they were around 20 lbs/9 kg, they're going to be 2 soon and still love being in them. My daughter nursed in hers while we were out only a few times but it was the most comfortable, and easiest carrier I'd tried to breastfeed in. As for getting it on and off, it may just be me but I have a lot of trouble getting any soft structure carrier on as a front carry. At my kids age we use back carry exclusively, and I find it super easy to put on. I do agree that they seem hot, but with a quick adjustment you can gain a little air flow to cool down. We've used them in weather close to 100F/37C with 80% humidity in the summer. In that kind of heat you definitely don't want to be outside for too long with baby strapped to you, but from a car to a store, etc is fine. I find them super comfortable to wear for long periods of time, easily adjustable to a huge range of heights and weights and great lumbar support when used with a toddler on a back carry."
babywearing,25xpsu,PreposterousMurmur,1 point,Mon May 19 16:01:15 2014 UTC,"I have a few different kinds of wraps, slings and mei tais. I have found that each kid is different. My first one loved the pocket slings in any carry and mei tai when he got older. The second one bucks like a wet cat when I try to put him in just about any carrier so I broke down and bought a new boba, which he will now tolerate. It took some time though.   Personally, I LOVE the padding and buckle supports, it's by far the most comfortable of all my carriers and it is really easy to get on and off. Baby seems to likes the infant insert now (5mo) which is one of the reasons why I picked the Boba, however, I do think it runs a lot hotter then my other carriers. That was ok for my winter baby but now when we go outside we both are starting to get a little sweaty, but maybe it's just me. I am considering getting the boba air to combat that but I would still say the regular one was worth the $. Hope that helps you decide."

All though I stop bf at three months so I never had that problem. Maybe you could give her a pacifier when she starts rooting or your finger just to calm her sucking need. My baby loves being in it, are you maybe wrapping to loose so she doesn't feel secure? Make sure she's high enough on your body also, her head should be right under your chin, if not your boobs can get in the way and make it uncomfortable for her. Also so little ones like the froggie position with their legs tucked inside, mine never did though she liked them sticking out the sides. Good luck! Oh and I got my meitai at target and it was super cheap and has lasted a long time with many washed and I'm not exactly gentle with it."

Are you sure it's actually a 6? What wrap, and where'd you get it? Another possibility is that you're not tightening your rails and baby is too low. But with an 8 week old especially, there's no reason for you to be running out of tails. My wife can still do FWCC in a 6 with our 20-lb 9 m.o. and she is your size."
babywearing,25q73v,bakemaster,1 point,Sat May 17 15:14:45 2014 UTC,It was bought online on a Facebook swap so I suppose it is possible it is a different size than advertised.

babywearing,25qlzi,grey_elk,2,Fri May 16 20:07:04 2014 UTC,"I haven't been through quite that, but I'll share a couple of (hopefully helpful) thoughts. First is that my youngest (the only one I've worn much) very rapidly got into much more if a schedule at that age, and got to where I could nurse him to sleep and then leave him on his own for a decent length nap. So, even without specific efforts, yours may move more toward a schedule in the next 3 weeks. Second thought is that, when my older son started daycare, I was worried about napping, as he only fell asleep nursing at home. They said he did just fine. Basically, babies are different with mommy than other people.   Personally, I wouldn't spend the time on maternity leave trying too hard to get him in a schedule. Keep doing what works and enjoying your time with him. They can/will have to work out their own routine with him. Maybe research gentle techniques for getting babies to sleep in cribs? Like swaddling (may slightly mimic cozy being-worn feeling), rocking, etc. I think Dr Sears has suggestions for those - you could google that.  Good luck! Sounds like you're doing great so far!"
babywearing,25qlzi,lambeekins,2,Sat May 17 04:34:40 2014 UTC,"Thank you, this actually makes me feel a lot better. I keep hearing this is a time when schedule can start to self-regulate but I am panicking that if it doesn't that he will just be here crying and screaming while hubby's parents try to figure out what to do...logically I know it will be okay, it's just that he goes from 0-100 very quickly and the intensity with which he screams is so horrible...but like you said, he may be different with them and the three of them will have to work it out! Thanks again for the reassurance."
babywearing,25qlzi,danibobanny,1 point,Sat May 17 16:00:39 2014 UTC,"My baby is a few weeks older than yours and he behaves exactly the same way. I don't have any family or close friends here as I am a fairly recent transplant, and my husband works pretty long hours so sometimes I honestly have no choice but to let him cry sometimes while I do chores or whatever. He screams for a while, stops for a bit, and starts up screaming again. He basically wants to be held upright all the time. My husband and parents tell me he is spoiled / I am spoiling him. I just don't really know what to do - it's this, or he screams and screams and screams and, well, you know. Personally I think both of our kids will turn out fine whether they are allowed to cry for an hour or so, or if they're carried around constantly."
babywearing,25nyy1,renyin14,2,Thu May 15 22:43:26 2014 UTC,I would try a tula they are more light weight. Or a boba
babywearing,25nyy1,Reidsmom,2,Fri May 16 03:36:23 2014 UTC,"How old is she? Do you use the infant insert? Usually SSC's are less hot than wraps (because they have open sides), but the infant insert is basically a fluffy blanket snug around your baby. As a babywearing consultant I'm not a fan of the insert (this heating up is one of the reasons), but if she is too small to use the Ergo without it and you don't have another carrier/wrap, you can try to put her in (with insert) with less clothes or even just a diaper. Keep in mind she also gets warm from your body heat, and being a bit cold is less dangerous than being too hot."
babywearing,25nyy1,VerityButterfly,1 point,Fri May 16 08:15:30 2014 UTC,She's almost 4 month and about 13 lbs. I am not using an insert with it. I don't think one would fit in there. It's already so tight as is...
babywearing,25nyy1,VerityButterfly,1 point,Fri May 16 13:23:38 2014 UTC,"Okay that's indeed old enough to wear her without the insert :) Other than that you could still try to put on less clothes. Basically, you are as warm as an incubator, so there is less need for clothes."

babywearing,25nyy1,Julepwa,1 point,Fri May 16 02:15:38 2014 UTC,That is pretty normal for ssc. I have heard great things about kindercarry and their kool knit option. Onya also have a carrier with mesh to keep it cooler.
babywearing,25nyy1,crimsondhampiel,1 point,Fri May 16 05:41:49 2014 UTC,"We got the performance version and live in a very warm climate and haven't overheated yet. We don't have it on too tight, the side strap get kept loose, but secure. Maybe yours are tighter than she likes? Our LO likes to push back and look around."
babywearing,25nyy1,kireidasha,1 point,Fri May 16 21:33:15 2014 UTC,"The ergo is quite hot so you may want to try a cooling towel. I have a kinderpack with a mesh label and it is definitely cooler than the ergo. My baby is also a lot more comfortable in it. You can also look Into the ergo performance, tula, boba, etc these are more lightweight"
babywearing,25mxl0,Flewtea,7,Thu May 15 16:34:20 2014 UTC,"From that picture, he's positioned far too low and your instincts are correct--that's unsafe. His head should be right by your chin so that you can tilt your head down and kiss him. He has no head control at this point, so it's not really him not keeping his head up, it's the wrap. Make the front cross higher on your body and consider tightening it more as well.  Edit: Also, the half of the panel you pull up as the final step should come up much higher on you and him--it was at about my girl's upper chest when she was that age I think."
babywearing,25mxl0,llama_llama_mama,1 point,Thu May 15 17:50:47 2014 UTC,Okay I will try putting it higher. That was my third attempt at putting it on. I'll get better!
babywearing,25mxl0,tricyclist,1 point,Thu May 15 19:04:02 2014 UTC,"I tightened it and it was to small for him to fit and it hurt me. I've decided its to hot in Georgia to wear that thing... I am sweating and all I did was put it on, try to squeeze him in, and then take it off. I think he is to big for a side position. He's 21in long and 9lbs. I'll try something different when he is bigger in the fall."
babywearing,25mxl0,Flewtea,2,Thu May 15 19:41:51 2014 UTC,The moby was a waste of money for my summer baby. I switched to a bali breeze gauze wrap and it's much cooler. And the moby stretches too much and my baby isn't even that heavy. It just felt really unsafe and wrong. I think that moby is the gateway wrap and people quickly realize there are other better solutions.
babywearing,25mxl0,sunrisecolours,1 point,Fri May 16 12:54:59 2014 UTC,"It was given to me. I'm seeing now that my other carrier, the ""hard"" carrier with straps is better. Even though it doesnt support his head."
babywearing,25mxl0,Flewtea,1 point,Fri May 16 17:20:32 2014 UTC,"Ours didn't like the moby so we used a baby bjorn. It may be something for you to look into (We got ours used at a good price; they don't have to be new and spendy). It has a head guard for infants that you can flip up for head support and when they've got it under control, you can flip it down and fasten it. A google search shows some pictures, and it has examples of both. We really liked it. I wore it in the summer and it wasn't that hot besides the heat of the baby."
babywearing,25mxl0,ShannonOh,1 point,Thu May 15 20:22:14 2014 UTC,"Yeah, you might want to wear just a camisole if you want to wear it, however he's not too big! If the tightening didn't help maybe moving up is all he needs. There are plenty of carriers that can accommodate a newborn if you're not comfortable with it, though. I would recommend staying away from the Baby Bjorn mentioned below, though. It's cheap, but you get what you pay for. It doesn't distribute weight well for you and doesn't keep baby in the most comfortable position (the forward facing can actually damage their hips). We have a Lillebaby that was about $130 and needs no infant insert to be used in the newborn stage."

babywearing,25kg9u,birdsaregross,3,Wed May 14 22:16:01 2014 UTC,"I believe in the right tool for the right job. I use the stroller when we're going to be out all day, long walks, when I'm having issues with my back or arms, etc. I use the carrier when we're going for a short walk, need to get things done around the house, going to be in a stroller unfriendly situation, I need the extra cuddles, etc. FWIT, I live in a pretty urban area.   If your stroller isn't taking up space you desperately need, I'd hold onto it."

That said, we only use it about one, maybe twice a week and we're out everyday multiple times so we babywear more often than not. I could do without it, but i wouldn't want to!"

babywearing,25kg9u,ShannonOh,1 point,Thu May 15 00:24:23 2014 UTC,"One really great use for a stroller is when you're shopping for clothes and need to try things on. I stood in a changing room trying to figure out where to put my baby down while trying on dresses - oops! Next time, I took a stroller!   I also like the stroller as a place for kiddo to sit and eat if we are spending a long day outdoors. Picnic tables at parks are not made for toddlers, so it's easier to sit him in the stroller.   We have an umbrella stroller that's easy to toss in the car, and a jogging stroller for running and long walks on gravel paths. I was lucky to find a jogging stroller that has a rear-facing option, so kiddo and I still get face-time like we would in a carrier and I can make sure the sun isn't in his eyes, he isn't slouched uncomfortably if asleep, etc."
babywearing,25kg9u,snailrabbitflamingo,1 point,Thu May 15 01:54:08 2014 UTC,My girls both preferred the stroller when we were out and about. I use the carrier mostly for clingy days to get stuff done. As they get older they often like the freedom of strollers.
babywearing,25kg9u,bumblemom0503,1 point,Tue May 20 14:03:13 2014 UTC,"Now that the weather's getting warmer, I've opted more for the stroller than a carrier because it seems to keep us both cooler."

babywearing,25hp2f,chotay29,5,Tue May 13 23:12:30 2014 UTC,Babywearing Faith on YouTube makes some awesome videos. There is a fb group called babywearing 102 that can be resourceful but can also be drama filled. Wrapping can be frustrating in the being it takes practice. I practiced with a stuffed animal at first.
babywearing,25hp2f,Cooper1216,1 point,Tue May 13 23:38:01 2014 UTC,I will definitely watch her videos. Thank you! There are so many different wrap youtube videos that I didn't quite know where to start. The friend who gave me the wrap added me to babywearing 102 on fb. I went to my mom's house for Mothers day so I went through my old toys and found my old plushie doll of the cartoon character Arthur. The front wrap cross carry seemed to work well with him.
babywearing,25hp2f,Cooper1216,3,Tue May 13 23:48:09 2014 UTC,Wrapyourbaby.com is another decent resource but I find her tutorials a little harder to follow. Keep practicing with the doll it'll make things a little easier in the long run.
babywearing,25hp2f,bakemaster,1 point,Wed May 14 00:03:09 2014 UTC,"Seconding Faith, her videos are the best. There's no substitute for being taught and critiqued by an experienced (and ideally, institute-certified) babywearer in person, though."
babywearing,25hp2f,bakemaster,1 point,Wed May 14 01:14:10 2014 UTC,"Start with front wrap cross carry, you should have enough length for that in a 5 and you can get it halfway set up before adding baby so it's beginner-friendly.  Rebozo carry uses a slip-knot to give you an over-the-shoulder sling carry, very much like a ring sling, but more dependent on the fabric. This would be a good second carry to learn, but it's a shorty carry so you'll have lots of extra fabric in a 5. A cotton didy should have enough grip for the knot to hold while still allowing adjustment.  Wait on back carries until your baby has good head control. When you feel like it's time to start exploring back carries, you'll want to spend some time getting baby used to being on your back without being wrapped, first. My Leo loved riding around on his dad, and when the time came for me to struggle with actually wrapping him up there, he was comfortable and steady. But your baby won't be ready for for back carries until around 3 months of age."
babywearing,25hp2f,ShannonOh,1 point,Wed May 14 01:31:56 2014 UTC,"I have two recommendations:   1) wrap everyday, once a day. If it works, great. If it doesn't, put the wrap down and try again tomorrow. This way you and baby don't get too frustrated if it takes some time to learn.  2) join and participate in a Carry of the Week. Either on thebabywearer.com or a FB page (everyday babywearing, 102, etc.). You'll learn a carry per week and have the opportunity to ask questions and get tips."
babywearing,25hp2f,iliketoasttoo,1 point,Wed May 14 01:37:31 2014 UTC,Wrapyourbaby.com is a great resource. Do you have a local babywearing group? If so they may host events (mine does!) where you can learn carries in person. It's always so much easier for me to learn from someone than from a video.

We have a standard tula that we bought for $150. We bought it from a 3rd party website only because they had the print we wanted.  Zulily is having a sale on Erogo's right now But if your not familiar it can take a while to get things from zulily, no more than a month usually, but still. I'm so used to Amazon PRIME that it kills me when we order from zulily.  I would definitely recommend a lending library or rental program as well, choosing a SSC can just come down to what is most comfortable for your body type and what your LO likes. Personally I love how adjustable the tula is and we use it daily with our 6 month old. We use it so much I'm considering buying a second SSC."

Regardless, you could probably just google your location + ""baby carrier lending library"" and find something.  Lending libraries are great because you get to actually use the carrier for a short time (usually somewhere between a week and a month), and see if it's what you and your little one like. It's like a test drive for baby carriers.  My own personal preference is the Ergo. I've got an Ergo, and love it, but it's definitely not ""pretty"". We wanted one both my hubby and I would wear, and that eliminated anything pretty or ""complicated"" to put on.  There are few methods of baby wearing that have a limited time frame for usage, you usually just have to make some minor adjustments along the way as LO grows. Let us know when you find something you love, and good luck to you mama!"
babywearing,25aek4,TattedCodeMonkey,3,Sun May 11 16:42:09 2014 UTC,"It was a little low, but I did better today. She fell asleep right away so I was afraid to adjust it. I just kept an hand on her as we walked around the mall.   I usually wear the Tula so it takes a little getting used to the sling."
babywearing,25aek4,ludaachristyy,4,Sun May 11 16:45:01 2014 UTC,"love it! yah that's a bit of a learning curve for RS but you got it. I'd def put the ring higher. I try to start out with the rings almost on my shoulder that way when I'm adjust it, it'll end up high on the front part of my shoulder."
babywearing,25aek4,ludaachristyy,2,Sun May 11 20:48:47 2014 UTC,"My wife had been wearing her, then she was trying on clothes so I held the LO. She was looking tired so i put it on one handed as I held her. I knew it wasn't great, but it got the job done and was good for a first try.   I tried again today around the house. I like it. The RS definitely much different from the Tula but it has its pros."

babywearing,25902x,digitaldivisions,3,Sun May 11 01:29:48 2014 UTC,"My younger babe is three weeks and my belly hasn't deflated yet; it shouldn't interfere wth babywearing. A newborn is so small that s/he will probably sit above the belly. I wore my toddler in front even during pregnancy.   How is it interfering, exactly? Maybe we can troubleshoot?"
babywearing,25902x,ShannonOh,1 point,Sun May 11 01:40:15 2014 UTC,"When I try to wrap the moby around my front it just seems super loose at the top and when I try to get it tighter my deflated low bump gets in the way and won't allow it. I have been doing it like the company's youtube video suggests. Maybe there is another way? With the sling it isn't so much my bump as I can't seem to get baby placed so her head is higher up, uncovered and kissable like is recommended for safety. Her head seems unsupported and has a tendency to fall against her chest."
babywearing,25902x,msuaussiemom,2,Sun May 11 03:09:06 2014 UTC,"Start your Moby closer to your chest. I start it with the top covering my boobs. Put it on snuggly, since it will stretch. My baby is a week and a half and we have been wearing in the Moby since day 3."
babywearing,25902x,ShannonOh,1 point,Sun May 11 12:05:27 2014 UTC,"Sounds like in both cases you need to start with the carrier tighter on your body.   When baby's head droops forward in the ring sling it's because the fabric behind her upper back needs to be tighter. And if baby is sitting too low, the bottom rail (the lower hem) is starting too loose. (This is assuming you're doing the heart to heart hold?)  If you want to take a pic I might be able to troubleshoot more (PM if you'd like)."
babywearing,25902x,anniczka,3,Sun May 11 10:08:16 2014 UTC,"To add to this (and I'm not an expert, just someone who survived the early weeks because of the Moby), I found it easiest to get tight after the second step. So I'd put it around my stomach, then criss cross on my back and when the two pieces were hanging down the front again, that's when I would adjust the tightness."
babywearing,25902x,iliketoasttoo,2,Sun May 11 13:02:34 2014 UTC,Your belly shouldn't interfere with wearing - I know plenty of pregnant moms who still wear. Maybe you're wearing too low? You should be able to easily kiss the top of baby's head.
babywearing,25902x,lambeekins,1 point,Sun May 11 01:55:15 2014 UTC,"I can't quite remember what I did with my non-deflated bump, but it wasn't a problem in using a woven like you use a Moby.

Back carries with babies who aren't yet sitting (with a woven) is really only used by very experienced babywearers.  This is because the muscles in babies backs aren't developed enough to be able to support themselves in any upright position for any amount of time. I know it's sooo tempting, but it's really best for your baby's spine to wait it out. Enjoy those front snuggles while you can!! <3"

I opted for the 360 over the original in case my baby hates facing in later on, as I've heard some kids do. The only downside I see is that the weight capacity is less (33 lbs, original is 45 lbs), but I don't see myself wanting to lug around a kid any heavier than the 360's upper weight limit anyway. The carrier has nice fabric and seems quite sturdy and well-made."

There's two charts - the first two images here - http://www.pinterest.com/babywearingtaz/how-to-use-a-woven-wrap/   You should be able to do almost all carries with a 6 (that's what 4.6 m is). I'm plus size and tall, but still often use a 6, I think the only thing I can't do is a double hammock with it. With your size, you could do most things with a 5 but the extra length is good while learning, it takes a while to get things as snug as they should be. You can always shorten the wrap or trade for a shorter size!"
babywearing,24y5p8,frogonmytoe,1 point,Wed May 7 13:53:29 2014 UTC,A 4.6m (size 6) will give you a lot if versatility in what carries you can do.  If it's your only wrap I'd go with the 6 :)

babywearing,243okj,bakemaster,3,Sun Apr 27 20:31:57 2014 UTC,"Our baby is already 7 months and getting heavier! She's 16 lbs and 28 inches long.   Okay, that rules out stretchy wraps (e.g. Moby).   A problem we have is our height. I am 4'11 and my husband is 6'1.   A woven wrap would give the most flexibility for different users, since there are so many different carries and tie-off methods. The height difference won't matter as much as a difference in chest size, for a woven - although my wife is shorter than I am, her chest is larger, so I can usually get by with a wrap 1 size smaller than she can for the same carry.  If you were to go for a soft structured carrier (SSC) you'd want to make sure to try before you buy, some are most easily adjustable than others.   We live in a place where the heat is dreadful!   I live in Sacramento, so I sympathize. Whether your climate is dry or humid will make a big difference. In our dry heat, people really like linen-blend woven fabrics, though they are tough to break in so buying used is a must for wrapping novices. Since we get so much sun, a light color is also a must for wearing outdoors (dark colors absorb more heat from sunlight).  Apart from the blend, a lighter fabric (measured in grams per square meter, or gsm) will obviously be more breathable and less hot. The caveat is that too light a fabric may be less supportive, especially as your baby grows, which makes you favor double- and triple-pass carries. Two or three passes of a light wrap can easily be hotter than one pass of a heavy wrap.  There are also SSCs available in light mesh and breathable fabrics and synthetics, though you'll have fewer options."

babywearing,243okj,redplusblueispurple,3,Sun Apr 27 20:33:26 2014 UTC,"You might check out Kinderpack and Babies Beyond Borders. Both have bigger carriers for kiddos as they grow, are adjustable, and are fairly simple in construction (meaning less fabric to be hot).  Personally, I love the Babies Beyond Borders full-buckle. I'm 5'1"" 105 lbs, and this fits me so much better than the Ergo. My kiddo is also petite, so at 15 months, he's just a little bigger than your baby (18 lbs, 29 inches). We're currently right on the cusp between the baby size one and the toddler one. The baby one doesn't support him well when he's sleeping anymore. So you would probably want to go straight to the toddler size.   One big upside to BBB vs other carriers is the price, you can get two for the cost of one pricier carrier, so you and your hubby can each have one that you keep adjusted to your height."

babywearing,244b8l,ShannonOh,1 point,Fri May 2 13:49:16 2014 UTC,I LITERALLY just finished making a diy ring sling!  I used cotton gauze from the fabric store. I wanted something g super breathable because my LO is super prone to heat rash.  It was on sale for $3 a yard so I only spent $8 with tax. Ill post a picture later.
babywearing,244b8l,Raewynrh,1 point,Fri May 23 00:35:35 2014 UTC,I'm very interested in making my own ring sling. Please post it!
babywearing,244b8l,Alidpayne,1 point,Sat May 24 23:43:28 2014 UTC,I'll get hubby to take a pic tomorrow!  It worked great today!  We went to the beach and I didn't want to trash my ergo with sand and sea water so I used the sling. Baby nursed in it and I pulled the fabric up over her shoulders and arms to keep her warm while walking back. She really cuddled into me and seemed very content.
babywearing,244b8l,Raewynrh,1 point,Sun May 25 00:28:50 2014 UTC,Also this is the fabric I used: http://www.joann.com/search?q=Cotton%20gauze  I used the purple and red tie dye but I'm going to make hubby a green one when we get home because he's jealous.
babywearing,244b8l,Raewynrh,1 point,Sun May 25 00:31:49 2014 UTC,"Here's a link: http://m.imgur.com/xFVOb9o  I used 2.5 yards cotton gauze and 2"" rings from the hardware store. I made it in a hurry for our trip otherwise I would have ordered the rings from slingrings.com like a good girl. To be honest, they are working great and have a 200 pound limit. My baby weighs one tenth of that. I wish the rings were a little larger because it's a bit of a hassle to adjust but on the flip side, if I'm the only one carrying baby I can just throw it on and go without any tightening.   I didn't cut my fabric down to be 30-38 inches like I read most places partly because I'm lazy and partly because I like having the extra fabric to tuck under baby's bum/ pull higher for discreet nursing."

babywearing,23vg7o,lizbethef,1 point,Thu Apr 24 18:44:22 2014 UTC,I've used an ergo but the buckles dug and made it uncomfortable. I then had a mei tai which worked great for a while. But trying to back carry with it was really uncomfortable for both of us. I remembered how comfy the Moby was when my first was tiny. So I got a woven wrap.
babywearing,23vg7o,LynnyLee,1 point,Thu Apr 24 19:25:59 2014 UTC,So cute. I've never had any luck back carrying with a wrap. Then again I have trouble getting my wiggly guy into any back carry.

Similar to a rebozo in that one tail goes over your shoulder and one tail under the opposite. Tie in front. Obviously make sure their face is visible.
babywearing,23wd1l,loveintheoven,1 point,Thu Apr 24 22:35:00 2014 UTC,"That was actually going to be what I tried next. I didn't know it was a thing. I thought I was being awesome and creative. Haha.

babywearing,23tguy,Rawrity,1 point,Thu Apr 24 00:48:27 2014 UTC,"After going nuts digging around to find my Spoonflower fabric sampler, only to find it right where I thought it would be but jammed and hidden...The voile is gauze like. Possibly a bit thicker than baby muslin. I have a gauze wrap (made from baby muslin) and it does kind of dig into the shoulders. I haven't really gotten into wraps personally, so this may be a factor in me not liking it much. It was pretty cheap to make from plain muslin despite being 5-6 yards of fabric. If you have tried gauze wraps and like them then by all means make a spoonflower one because a full length wrap is going to be at least $100-150. Otherwise I might suggest a shorty wrap (2.5-3 yards), which with some $10 dollar ring sling rings can easily (and not bulkily like the full length wrap) be no-sew converted to a ring sling (awesome babywearing purchase those)."
babywearing,23tguy,I3km,1 point,Thu Apr 24 04:29:43 2014 UTC,"Thank you!!! I was planning on a shorty, if I like the gauze wrap I have coming. Which would be around 80.00. Cheaper than those"" designer"" wraps. :) there is a doctor who fabric I desperately want a wrap out of!"
babywearing,23rica,Kappa_the_imp,3,Wed Apr 23 12:58:49 2014 UTC,The carrier should go from one knee to the other making a seat. I can't see a seat so that could be the problem here.
babywearing,23rica,msuaussiemom,2,Wed Apr 23 14:19:17 2014 UTC,"There is a seat, you just can't see it with the crappy picture angle, sorry. I probably should have tried to get a photo from the back instead of just the side. I tried crossing the straps in the front after this, and it felt more secure at the top, but even when I moved the waist strap up higher, he was still awfully low. His head should be up around my shoulders somewhere right?"
babywearing,23rica,msuaussiemom,2,Wed Apr 23 14:55:17 2014 UTC,"Yes he should be higher. Make sure his knees are higher than his butt, making a m. He may just be arching, but something about his position doesn't look right. How old is he?"
babywearing,23rica,msuaussiemom,1 point,Wed Apr 23 15:30:41 2014 UTC,He's 9 months. And I think he was arching. He was starting to grump by the time I took pictures.
babywearing,23rica,aerowyn26,2,Wed Apr 23 15:40:30 2014 UTC,Yep I understand that. Back carries take a while to get used to and for baby to get used to. My 21 month old still acts up sometimes when I'm trying to put him on my back.
babywearing,23rica,IfIHadaCoconut133,1 point,Wed Apr 23 15:43:49 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure he's up high enough, it's our first time in a mei tai. It's on my natural waist but he seems so low, and feels kind of loose on my upper back."

babywearing,23rica,IfIHadaCoconut133,1 point,Wed Apr 23 14:17:31 2014 UTC,"Tie right under your boobs. I know natural waist is recommended, but tying higher sits him up higher. Also, your straps could use some tightening. Change that and it will feel 100x better :)"
babywearing,23rica,memmab,2,Wed Apr 23 15:49:48 2014 UTC,I tied it higher and it made a huge difference. Now we have  a different problem. I can't seem to wrap the straps back around without digging into his legs now.
babywearing,23rica,ouchmyback,2,Wed Apr 23 18:09:10 2014 UTC,"Bring it up under his legs not over.  Cross the butt, under the legs."
babywearing,23rica,MrsC7906,1 point,Wed Apr 23 21:22:32 2014 UTC,"You'll want to go over the first leg under the second. It will be a little diggy, but it helps keep that m shape to their legs and hips that will keep the carry more comfortable for them."
babywearing,23mv9b,burdydee,1 point,Mon Apr 21 23:55:40 2014 UTC,"I haven't got much experience with cashmere but plenty of folks have them locally and say they're super squishy but way too hot for summer. Our summers are very hot (regularly over 100F/40C) and very dry so YMMV.   People usually like a well-broken-in linen blend for our hot summers. I highly recommend Didymos Indio linen blends, very supportive and consistent weave, very comfortable when broken in - I would love a Zinc but don't have the cash to purchase."

I haven't seen one but the thinnest wrap I have is didy ginkgo tussah at 170 g/m2 and the rails are a little diggy with my 20 lb son.  It could work if you stick to carries with several passes to distribute the weight evenly and avoid digging. But I'd definitely try before you buy.  Edit: Someone in my local group recommends Agave, another didy linen blend that has similar qualities to the Salvia, but more substantial and less likely to dig."
babywearing,23mv9b,bakemaster,1 point,Tue Apr 22 17:32:33 2014 UTC,"I ended up going with didy petrol indio tussah, pretty excited! Can't wait to get it. It's exactly what I was dreaming of for summer."
babywearing,23lyw7,eve-,5,Mon Apr 21 18:32:53 2014 UTC,"If you're getting a woven, you really have no need for a stretchy. I used my woven with my little on day 8. And yes, it does get pretty easy. If you go with an ssc, look into a kinderpack, most ssc people choose kp over ergo any day, and if you want to splurge check out tula. Personally I really dislike straps and buckles, so I stick to wraps, slings and mt. But it's all about personal preference and comfort.  Edit: mt= mei tai"
babywearing,23lyw7,burdydee,3,Tue Apr 22 00:25:46 2014 UTC,"If you have the budget, don't rule out getting a soft structured carrier as well. It's easier for most Dads and babysitters who don't want to fuss with learning a woven. And, if you're as lazy as I am, I only would use a wrap when I'd be wearing her for a long time--when it's a quick thing, I hated fussing with tying it and leaving it on always felt uncomfortable to me, since I hate lots of fabric in any of my clothes."
babywearing,23lyw7,Flewtea,2,Mon Apr 21 20:22:35 2014 UTC,"Boyfriend is just as excited for the wrap as I am -- actually, wanting a carrier that would fit both of us without adjusting buckles and straps was one of the reasons we picked the wrap style.  I keep offering to buy my parents an Ergo or BabyBjorn, but so far, they say they want to try the wrap too. I guess I just bragged about how cool they are too much!"
babywearing,23lyw7,Flewtea,1 point,Mon Apr 21 20:25:25 2014 UTC,"Well, I hope it works out for you both! You really can't beat a woven's versatility. Please stay away from the BabyBjorn, though, if they do decide otherwise. For the money there are so many more comfortable and versatile carriers that don't cause you back problems and baby hip problems with extended wear."
babywearing,23lyw7,burdydee,1 point,Mon Apr 21 20:27:57 2014 UTC,"I know, I've read that they're pretty shitty, but I doubt my parents will be wearing often.

I keep seeing BBs for $20 or less on Craigslist and in thrift/resale stores, and it's hard to argue with that price point for such limited use!"

babywearing,23lyw7,CapinWinky,1 point,Tue Apr 22 15:11:47 2014 UTC,"SSC? Something strap carrier? I'm talking about this Boba carrier with the hood attachment... it looks just like an Ergo! I actually mistook it for an Ergo, but the momma corrected me."
babywearing,23lyw7,PictureSarah,3,Mon Apr 21 21:23:23 2014 UTC,SSC = Soft Structured Carrier  Example: Ergo  :)
babywearing,23lyw7,plasticcastle,3,Mon Apr 21 21:49:16 2014 UTC,"There are tons of brands of SSC. Ergo is just the one with the most visibility/market share/mainstream usage. But other brands are not knock-offs of it. I had a Boba, and I chose it because it has a taller body than an Ergo, which I prefer. I also liked the foot straps. My friend prefers a Beco because it has an inner layer which she finds convenient for getting baby on her back more easily.   There are a lot of subtle differences between these brands when you get into it, from size/shape of the body of the carrier, angle of the straps, padding of the straps, addition of extras like pockets/toy loops/foot straps/etc. People can be pretty specific about what they want and attached to the brands they prefer. The more you get into the babywearing community, the more interesting brands you will encounter besides just the most common ones. And I would say that most people who are babywearing enthusiasts, would prefer a SSC other than the Ergo.  My friend thought that Baby Hawk was a style of carrier, and that she had a Baby Hawk knock off. I was happy to tell her that Baby Hawk is just one common brand of a mei tai carrier, and that her Kozy was totally just as legit. And in fact, I personally prefer a Kozy (for the same reason I preferred Boba over Ergo - a taller body). Speaking of which, I would totally recommend a mei tai over a SSC any day. :)"
babywearing,23lyw7,snowteetzomg,1 point,Mon Apr 21 23:17:03 2014 UTC,"If anything, Ergo is the Boba knock off. Boba's are superior (I've used both) but cost a little more than Ergo does. That's why more people have Ergo, because it's cheaper."
babywearing,23lh89,MamaJay,4,Mon Apr 21 15:35:49 2014 UTC,"I don't have much comment on the prices but don't expect too much from getting a cooler wrap. Nothing is going to change the fact that her body heat is pressed up against your body heat. If you're both only as sweaty as she would be if you were cuddling her and you if you were wearing a heavy backpack, that's about the best you're going to get."
babywearing,23lh89,Flewtea,3,Mon Apr 21 20:29:57 2014 UTC,"This. I wore my kiddo in Honduras in 95+ degree heat for two weeks. Nothing was going to be cool. Sweating happens as soon as you step out of the shower there. But we survived, and it wasn't terrible.   I ended up mostly using my ring sling because the Honduran ladies told me it looked cooler. The day I came out in my structured carrier (Babies Beyond Borders full-buckle), I got chastised that baby was going to be too hot. So even though I felt about the same with either, I went with the local wisdom.  One thing that really helped was putting something in between kiddo and I to dissipate heat. The local water companies sell drinking water in little bags, which was just about the right size to stick in between kiddo and I. Since it was squishy, it wasn't uncomfortable, and if it started off cold from a fridge or cooler, it provided decent cooling power for a couple hours.   I'm thinking of using some of those gel ice packs this summer, if we need to be out in the heat for long stretches. I wouldn't use them frozen, obviously, but cold from the fridge should do at least as well as the bags of water."

I've worn backpacks before with it, but that just seems to be TOO much weight on me, it'll make my back hurt. :/"
babywearing,23lhi7,lizbethef,2,Mon Apr 21 23:23:01 2014 UTC,"Depending on how long I'll be out, and how far I'll be from my house or car, I have two options.   My go-to is a purse with a long strap that I can wear messenger-style across my body. I put it on after I put the carrier on, and the strap goes between me and baby. This works for either front or back carries. I've used it with an Ergo, ring sling, and wrap.  My purse is big enough for: * My wallet, keys, phone, tube of lotion, pack of gum & lip balm * An extra diaper & cover (we use cloth) * Wet bag for used diapers * Sandwich bag of wipes * Bib * Small toy or book * Small flannel receiving blanket that can be used as a changing pad, burp cloth, extra diaper, etc.  For running errands or a visit to a friend's house, this is enough.  If we're going to be out all day and will need to do multiple diaper changes, need to have a water cup and snacks, I usually put kiddo on my front, and carry a backpack on back."

babywearing,23jlfa,Sbzitz,2,Mon Apr 21 00:13:23 2014 UTC,"It gets better. I promise. I know that hearing your baby is hard, doesn't ever get easy, maybe you can try shushing while putting him in and singing or humming on the way home. Does he take a pacifier? Or maybe you can put a hand on him while you're driving. If nothing else try a shirt that is kinda dirty, smells like you, that you can put near him on the ride home. Good luck. Also take heed that you are a good mom. I know I'm just a stranger on the internet but we all need to hear it. You can do this."
babywearing,23jlfa,solongandthanks42,2,Mon Apr 21 01:48:50 2014 UTC,Adding little mobile in high contrast or putting a mirror back there helps and playing music helps.  If your kid gets grumpy at particular time make sure you aren't driving then.   Make sure with the changing seasons your carseat isn't too hot. If they have neck sweat they're too warm.

You are all he knows and when he is in the Moby, really close to your chest, he feels safe and falls asleep. I would suggest just getting him in the car seat when you know he is deep asleep. If he starts fussing, turn on your radio and search for white noise and turn up the volume. He will still wake up though, since he won't be able to feel you close to him but hopefully that will help.  My little one loved the Moby and it is the same thing with him.

babywearing,232otv,SaltyDuchess,1 point,Tue Apr 15 15:55:13 2014 UTC,I wore it all summer last year. It gets to the low 100s here and the Moby was sweltering. I think you'll like it. And you probably can sell it on FBs babywearing on a budget swap if you end up not liking it. I'll agree with the others about it not wing soft and diggy but those weren't deal breakers for me. I have the rainbow one and I think it's beautiful.
babywearing,22rrwt,LadySekhmet,3,Fri Apr 11 11:48:43 2014 UTC,"The Moby is extremely hot, so I would not recommend that. A woven wrap would be good, but they are expensive. If you have basic sewing skills you can make your own, thats what I did. I made mine out of osnaburg (sp?) fabric. If you Google you should be able to find info on making your own. I haven't tried my mei tai with a newborn, but if you roll the waist to make it shorter it could probably work."
babywearing,22rrwt,msuaussiemom,2,Fri Apr 11 12:49:27 2014 UTC,The Baby k'tan breeze is a nice alternative. It's like a wrap but easier to put on and it's more of a mesh fabric.

babywearing,22rrwt,kateohkatie,2,Sat Apr 12 20:58:32 2014 UTC,"I liked a ring sling for my summer preemie.  I got my Maya wrap at a consignment shop for a song, but there are a bunch of buy-sell-trade babywearing groups on Facebook where you can usually find Maya's for <$40 or so.  The lopsided weight distribution wasn't an issue since he was so tiny, and if was great being able to hitch him up high on my chest or drop him lower to nurse.  We've also gotten limited use out of it now that he's a busy toddler, though admittedly it's only for quick up/down times now since the one shoulder does cause me some back pain (as you'd expect when carrying someone weighing 24 lb! :))"
babywearing,22rrwt,knottymommy,2,Fri Apr 11 13:31:30 2014 UTC,"I really love ring slings for newborns.  They're very adjustable and if you get one in a single-layer cotton or linen blend, they're nice and cool (as cool as 2 people sharing body heat gets) since you've only got one layer).  If you're on a budget, you can buy ring sings from SlingRings.com and a length of supportive fabric (bottomweight like linen or tight weave cotton - think be sheet not quilting cotton) and make your own ring sling.  If you don't sew or don't want to commit to turning a strong scarf/length of fabric into a ring sling permanently, you can make a no sew ring sling or just use a short woven wrap/supportive scarf or length of fabric in a rebozo carry if you don't want to use rings at all.  I love stretchy wraps, too, but not as much for warm weather.  The Wrapsody stretch hybrid is a nice alternative.  It's sort of in between a stretchy and a woven wrap."
babywearing,22rrwt,HoopyGalore,1 point,Fri Apr 11 13:52:44 2014 UTC,"As someone else said, you could make your own wrap out of osnaburg relatively cheaply. I love mine, very supportive and comfortable and cost me about $35 total. If you're concerned with being too warm, you could make one from cotton gauze. That was what my first wrap was and I found it pretty easy to work with. The material is lightweight and breathable but still supportive. I made mine for $12!"
babywearing,22rrwt,VerityButterfly,1 point,Fri Apr 11 14:01:37 2014 UTC,"A moby will be quite warm, and a mei tai won't give enough head support for such a tiny baby.  For babies this young there are no SSC's that are small enough. A wrap, preferably a small one (most wraps are around 70cm wide.. uuh 27 inch, some brands also have 60cm/23inch wide) and/or a thin one so you don't get a lot of bulk to work around with your baby. A ringsling with these qualities is also a good option, but less versatile (and in my opinion harder to get perfect than a wrap).  The Ellevill Paisley's are thin wraps with bamboo, which I think is nice and cool (cooler than 100% cotton) and ideal newborn wraps.  For premature babies the best way to wrap is the Kangaru, because this way you'll have minimum bulk between the legs. But the Kangaru is quite hard to get right, so if you don't feel comfortable using it the Front Wrap Cross Carry is also a good option. In this case I think contacting a babywearing consultant would be really worth the money!"

Next time I will make the straps ever so slightly thinner and the base of the seat slightly wider to give miss knee to knee coverage.

We got the organic purely for color reasons and have had it a year now and I my only complaints are that it doesn't have a pocket and it doesn't have a way to store the hood out of the way easily. It's comfy, it's adjustable in every way I could want, the kid likes it, it's easy to put on and take off. I can't use the lumbar support because my waist would have to be significantly bigger but it seems like a cool feature. These days she's almost always on my back, though. When she was littler, I love being able to face her forward with good hip position."

Wonderful back support. Baby loves it (she hated the Ergo we had). We have the airflow because my husband carries her in the home a lot when I am at work and she gets hot. The hood is a bit annoying to store when the head support piece is up. Other than that it is an A+.   It is awesome to support your local store, but in will say this. They have them online at bed, bath and beyond. Sign up for their mailing list to get a 20% off coupon. It came to like $90!"

I have the k'tan right now but it's already getting tight on my guy and he is only 3 weeks. Not sure if I can use the Lillebaby on him yet although it does say newb-30lbs or whatever."
babywearing,21yq0w,Emckey,1 point,Wed Apr 2 16:31:52 2014 UTC,The nice thing about the Lillebaby is how versatile it is. My baby never really liked the froggy position so with the snaps in she was much more comfortable. We have used it starting when she was about 9 pounds. She is now 6 months and a little over 12 lbs (very petite). It works great. As soon as your baby has some head control (as needed with all carriers of this type) I think it would work great! I highly recommend it!

My daughters legs have to be spread really far in the mei tai and it just doesn't seem as secure to me. I prefer to use it for back carries because it is quicker to put on than my woven but if I'll be wearing her for a long time, or want her to sleep, I'll use my woven. I did read a tip that you can use a hair tie to gather the material of the sash to make it easier for small babies to straddle. Good luck!"

This is one of those carriers that qualifies as a ""crotch dangler"", so there isn't enough room at the base to support a curled up baby.   You might want to consider looking into getting a more ergonomic carrier. Infantino makes two - the Sash and the Union - that would be better options than what you have and still be affordable."

For longer wear, they're going to get uncomfortable because they put all the weight of the baby on one shoulder. I have a mei tai and I really love it - the straps criss cross across the back and distributes weight really well. There are also a myriad of other soft structured carriers she could try that will probably be more comfortable than the Infantino.

My favorites (to make) are double-layer silk dupioni and medium-weight 100% linen (5.3oz), single layer for Summer."
babywearing,20zzr8,VerityButterfly,2,Mon Mar 24 12:59:43 2014 UTC,"Ideally, you'd want a short wrap to turn into a ringsling. Personally, I think a nice 100% cotton denim is a good second. Just like wraps, denim has a diagonal stretch but nog horizontal or vertical, because it is woven in twill or cross twill binding.  I would not recommend making a ring sling out of knit, since stretchy wraps should always be wrapped with three layers to give enough support to make it safe for babywearing. A rings sling will only have one layer, with no cross between the legs, so that's a buttpop (or worse) waiting to happen."
babywearing,20zzr8,VerityButterfly,1 point,Sat Mar 22 13:31:31 2014 UTC,Do you have any suggestions on places where I could find those types of fabrics?

babywearing,20s6s6,pinktoothbrush,2,Wed Mar 19 17:55:26 2014 UTC,"Even though he is long, most babies will pull their legs up into a ""froggy"" position, and will curl up inside a wrap!  I love my wrap for our 7 week old, but I also like our ring sling - I find it much easier to nurse in, but I've been using one for the last 12 years!   If there is a baby wearing store near you, usually they will let you try out many styles of carrier to see what suits you best.  Some also have loaner programs so you can try them for a few days.  Good luck mama!   Ring slings by me: www.slingtasticslings.ca"
babywearing,20s6s6,Soirenoir,2,Wed Mar 19 12:08:04 2014 UTC,"A wrap is perfect for babies of every size because it's basically customizable :) For babies up to 4/5 months I like wraps a lot more than carriers. If you want something you can use for a long time, I'd consider a woven wrap. Elastic wraps are easier at first, but you can only use them up to 9 kg I think. With a woven you have more options,  you can also use it as a sling for example."

babywearing,20q2op,hello-titty,2,Tue Mar 18 15:53:54 2014 UTC,What about a homemade Moby Wrap? It's 5-1/2 yards of jersey knit fabric cut in half long ways. So you get two wraps out of the same piece of fabric. You can look around for the cheapest fabric but you want to use some sort of knit. Hobby Lobby usually has 40 percent off any one piece of fabric coupon online.   Plus it's super compact and easy to travel with.

babywearing,20grxj,bravelittletoaster87,5,Sat Mar 15 06:21:42 2014 UTC,Moby Wrap is a great stretchy wrap. I think Boba also makes a good stretchy.
babywearing,20grxj,littlebighotcold,2,Sat Mar 15 12:40:24 2014 UTC,I agree that a stretchy wrap is a great starter wrap. I would probably try the Baby K'tan since it's less fabric than the Moby and people seem to like it. I'm not sure if it's quite as adjustable as the Moby. I used a Moby at first and then woven wraps once my son got older.   Just be very careful about head positioning with a preemie. You want to make sure their chin is up off of their chests but also not too far backwards. Pay close attention to any signs of labored breathing. My son had some sensitivity to positioning in swings and car seats for a while until his airway got stronger. PS-What car seat do you have?
babywearing,20grxj,kaceface,1 point,Sat Mar 15 16:45:52 2014 UTC,"Thankfully my son has had no breathing issues which is rare, it seems like the wraps are certainly the way to go, I'm going to ask the nicu nurses for advice as well. We got the Graco snug ride 30 classic connect travel system with car seat and stroller as its rated to start at four pounds. His neonatologist suggested it because they think he will be discharged before he hits five pounds. He was 3 lbs 6 oz at birth and is 4 lbs 7 oz now. I've been looking because he's in his open air crib and as soon as he can feed fully in his own hell be home, they are talking next week or so. Trying to get ready for normal activities once he is here  :-)"

I got a Mei Tai carrier for my daughter and started wearing her around 5 or 6lbs. They were born at 35 weeks, but I didn't wear them till about a month old due to recovering from my c-section. A Mei Tai is a great option for tiny babies because you can just roll up the waist to fit the baby correctly. My daughter loved it until nearly a year old when it became uncomfortable for me to wear for extended periods of time, so we upgraded to toddler carriers."

babywearing,20grxj,bakemaster,1 point,Sat Mar 15 23:28:03 2014 UTC,My daughter came home at 4 lbs 3 oz. I preferred the sleepy/boba wrap to the moby until she was about 7 lbs (and then liked them both for awhile). I think the moby says on it they have to be 8 lbs (but they don't really). The boba says 2 lbs but talk to your dr if <5 lbs. I never talked to my dr I figured 4.5 was close enough to 5 lbs and was very careful to keep her head at a good angle and not covered. Good luck!

babywearing,20fxpk,cantwait12,2,Fri Mar 14 23:24:48 2014 UTC,I was reading other posts about fit and I think it is the right size but I have a few concerns. I know the wrap is supposed to be tight but I kind of felt squished. It felt like she was squishing my insides while she was in it. It is really hard to get her into the wrap. I kept thinking the circulation in her legs would get cut off but her legs were fine and she wasn't crying. I still love the idea of the k'tan but I am concerned that it isn't the right fit. Did it start this way for everyone and I just have to wait for it to stretch out some? From everything I have read this should be the right size and I think the medium would be to big. I have never done this before obviously. : )
babywearing,20fxpk,Mombeth,1 point,Fri Mar 14 23:33:27 2014 UTC,I found the ktan to run big and have heard that from several others too so I'm surprised to hear it's tight on you. I would omagine it will strtch a bit more if you wear it a few times. I think if baby is uncomfortable she'll let you know.
babywearing,20fxpk,dolphininafishbowl,1 point,Sat Mar 15 14:37:09 2014 UTC,Yes definitely! I was playing around with different carriers and my LO would loudly let me know if she wasn't happy with the fit! Haha

babywearing,20en43,goddesspyxy,2,Sat Mar 15 01:28:00 2014 UTC,"I personally find them more comfortable. The panel is wider than the ergo, beco etc which means it has a more comfortable fit for longer and it also has padding where their legs come out. The arm straps have more padding and I find them way more easily adjustable. I like that the hood is detachable too.   My daughter was never in to wrapping but I love all the different wraps and so them doing wrap conversions is a big thing for me.   The company is family owned and the owner is heavily involved in the community that surrounds it. Even though the wrap conversions sell for a lot more on market value she's said she'll never raise retail price which I like."

It's what I use when I know it'll be a quick up and down (across busy parking lots, emergency carrier in the diaper bag in case someone gets unexpectedly tired/cranky).  The one shoulder carry just isn't supportive enough and puts too much strain on my neck/shoulder.  I think a ring sling with a different style of shoulder would probably be better for me.  I usually use a woven wrap or one of my African Kangas/Kitenges.  The Torso carry I can do with the African wraps is a lot easier on me and the woven wraps I can really customize how their weight is distributed depending on where my pain is worst on any given day.  I use our Boba SSC sometimes, but I find it puts too much pressure on the pressure points in my hips if it's too low and too much pressure on my lower back if it's higher.

babywearing,1yvyah,IfIHadaCoconut133,1 point,Wed Feb 26 16:56:22 2014 UTC,"I preferred a woven wrap when my son was a toddler. It was my go to carrier. It fit all sizes well. Back carries were easiest in the wrap. And it was versatile. I could use it as a sling in a pinch, as well as a blanket and a cover.  I did love my pouch and ring sling for emergencies and short walks or when I wanted to hip carry. I used a Mom and Me Pouch and a Maya Wrap, but I love Sakura Blooms and the modified wrap slings too.  I think both types are essential. I prefer having a few options. Different carriers work for different things, and it's nice to have choices. I am petite, and the SCCs don't fit me so well. I like the BOBA best though."

With the Ergo I can wear either of them with minimal adjusting and I forget that I'm wearing them most of the time!"
babywearing,1yvzpq,MissesK,5,Tue Feb 25 13:05:30 2014 UTC,"https://www.facebook.com/groups/thebabywearingswap/  The group has albums of for sale (FS) or for trade (FT) wraps, slings, etc. organized by type and size. It's very good. Sometimes there are great deals, and usually you at least save a bit off retail, except for newly released wraps or very trendy names... cough cough artipoppe. We have a didy and an osha we bought off the swap.  If you want to stick to slightly more affordable wraps I recommend Natibaby. They have a pretty good range of prices on their website and unlike some of the smaller operations, they're not constantly sold out of everything. Little Frog is a bit cheaper than Natibaby, but people in my local babywearing groups don't tend to be big fans."
babywearing,1yvzpq,bakemaster,3,Tue Feb 25 14:57:54 2014 UTC,That depends on what brand you want and what your budget is.  There are lots and lots of options and they're all a little different.  I liked getting used wraps because it saved me some money and they were already a bit broken in.  There are some great swap groups on FaceBook.  TheBabywearer.com is a great source for learning about different brands and blends and there's a FSOT (For Sale Or Trade) board as well.
babywearing,1yvzpq,knottymommy,3,Tue Feb 25 13:24:44 2014 UTC,"Definitely the Facebook swap! Just make sure you check out the seller feedback and protect yourself by paying through PayPal.

babywearing,1yvzpq,Bugalee,2,Mon Apr 28 18:42:31 2014 UTC,"Exactly.  I sent my husband a link to a linen/bamboo blend Natibaby that I was hoping to have for the wedding in the summer, but he freaked at the price tag.   His exact quote was, ""'Oh honey, we're done buying diapers.'  Or whatever the hell this is.""  I'm trying to sell off my wedding dress to get a wrap or two.  From what I've seen, if you buy even one limited release from one of these companies and sit on it for a couple years, you can make money on them. Even if you end up using them.  But, I haven't had a single bite on that stupid dress, so I don't think it's going to happen."
babywearing,1yvzpq,ouchmyback,2,Mon Apr 28 19:09:49 2014 UTC,The wraps have a great resell value because they work better after they're worn in which is super awesome. Good luck selling your dress! We used our tax refund on ours lol.

If it gets any colder than that (and it does here in DC, we went all the way down to -12 this year), I add on one of these.

I did look at some cheaper options but I like the design of that one best, and managed to get a deal on a daily sale site."

For 20-minute or so walks here in MN, where we've spent a disgusting amount of this winter at 0 F or below, I put a light fleece on both me and her, booties, mittens, hat under the fleece's hood, then stick her in the carrier. Then my big wool coat around us both."
babywearing,1ytm72,Soirenoir,2,Tue Feb 25 03:34:39 2014 UTC,"I generally use my carrier to run from my car into stores so the amount of time we are outside is generally pretty short. It's been absolutely freezing where I am (below 30 degrees) but baby gets hot as soon as we are inside somewhere. So I dress her reasonably well (sweatshirt, pants, and onsie) and put her into the carrier while in the car. Then, I wrap the outside of the carrier in a fleece blanket that covers her entirely as we run into the store. This way, I can remove the fleece blanket as soon as we're inside so she doesn't overheat. So far, has worked well. I do this mostly when running into the grocery store."

babywearing,1y8dsj,romyck,3,Tue Feb 18 10:55:55 2014 UTC,"I'd say to wait until he's a little more experienced in BFing too before it's going to work real well in the Ergo. Nursing in the Ergo was easy for me once each of the kids hit 5 months or so. They could then kinda ""hold"" the boob to push it away from them if it became too smothering. I never lowered the waistbelt, just let out the straps on the arms a bit. Then jacked a boob up to face level."
babywearing,1y8dsj,Anchored2Hope,3,Tue Feb 18 13:29:25 2014 UTC,Loosen a strap on the side you want to feed. Shift baby slightly and latch.
babywearing,1y8dsj,MrsC7906,3,Tue Feb 18 14:02:05 2014 UTC,"I've been breastfeeding in the ergo since my LO was 3 months old. She's always been on the small side, so I have nursed her in the ergo from 9 lbs to her current almost 8 month old weight at 15 lbs. I am by no means an expert, but I'll tell you how I do it.   I put the waist belt allllll the way down on my hips. All the way. Like the tightening strap thing? It's let out completely and I'm not super large or anything. I also cock the whole carrier a few inches to whichever side she's going to be eating off of. Like scootch it to the right for right boob. K. Now put baby in. Position head right at nipple. Strap yourself up. Start walking. Wriggle around and find your happy place. Honestly, my boobs are kind of tubular and despite the fact that I have an almost 8 month old I STILL hold my boob up with one hand while she's ergo nursing. But I would venture to say that most women don't have this problem.   Also, you're right- the YouTube videos are less than helpful considering the babies are all like 12 months + and the babies are all huge. My tiny LO is dwarfed by them.   Good luck!   I also nurse in the ring sling all the time. I bought one used from a local shop. Love it! We've had about 4 zillion carriers and these two are the only ones we ever use."
babywearing,1y8dsj,musicalkel88,2,Tue Feb 18 14:58:13 2014 UTC,"I was only ever able to BF successfully in a ring sling, but I have rather large breasts."
babywearing,1y8dsj,Lilpeapod,2,Tue Feb 18 12:05:46 2014 UTC,"Try shifting the ergo toward your hip a little also so that baby's head is in line with your boob. I never used the infant insert (just used a rolled up blanket under baby's bum) so that may be making it harder. Also it gets easier to nurse in the ergo as baby gets bigger and has better head support. I had trouble doing it around 2 months, but now at 15 weeks it's much easier."
babywearing,1y8dsj,iliketoasttoo,2,Tue Feb 18 12:48:02 2014 UTC,"I only tried once so I'm not an expert at it, but I left the waist alone and loosened the shoulder straps until she was low enough to latch."
babywearing,1y5hu0,Axora,2,Mon Feb 17 15:47:35 2014 UTC,"Also, and I wearing her right? She's comfortable and feels totally secure. That's what's important right?"
babywearing,1y5hu0,MonsoonAndStone,2,Mon Feb 17 15:48:24 2014 UTC,"Yep, looks right, it's most important that they're not going to fall out and their legs are positioned correctly. The ergo baby site has videos on the different carry styles, if you want to double check."
babywearing,1y5hu0,bakemaster,1 point,Mon Feb 17 18:12:27 2014 UTC,"Yup, safety and comfort for both wearer and baby are what's important. Long term comfort comes from good ergonomics which for infants means proper ""squatting"" leg position and back curving forward. For the wearer, it's more about adjusting the belt and straps.  When my son was very tiny, I found the Ergo was most comfortable with the belt high up on my waist. As he got bigger the weight was easier to carry on my hips. Depends on your body type and anatomy as well."
babywearing,1y5hu0,MonsoonAndStone,1 point,Mon Feb 17 18:32:18 2014 UTC,Yeah that's kind of why I asked. The belt seems more comfortable higher up than it was on the women in the tutorials. My niece is only 10 or 11lbs. I'll try the belt lower once she's bigger.   Thanks :-)
babywearing,1y5hu0,peasandcarrrots,2,Mon Feb 17 22:24:34 2014 UTC,Yeah I loooove my ergo. I use it for walks or if I'm taking the bus. It's making me pretty strong too. Baby just loves being worn and will almost always nap in the carrier.

babywearing,1y49az,VKDM,3,Mon Feb 17 04:10:58 2014 UTC,"It's probably worth it to check out kinderpacks and Tula carriers. They are two other popular brands very similar to ergos, but for wearers who have tried all of the above, the KP and Tula seem to be preferred.   Are there any baby wearing meetings near you. Baby-wearing international chapters let you ""check out"" carriers from their lending library for a month so you can really get the feel for each carrier before you drop $100+."
babywearing,1y49az,ShannonOh,2,Tue Feb 18 15:48:01 2014 UTC,"I think the ergo will be your best bet cost & support wise. I have the performance one (it has the most structure and is light weight). It's got a LOT of straps and buckles. If you have money to spend or can find 2nd hand, maybe look into beco carriers. Maybe also check out Mai tais.   If you have any baby stores nearby check them out, they probably have sample carriers and will let you try them out. For buying, check craigslist, nearby mom groups, or consignment shops."
babywearing,1y49az,SillyJane,1 point,Mon Feb 17 05:29:55 2014 UTC,"Thanks! We do have stores, but trying one or two or three on with your baby vs. actually wearing them for an hour or two is so different. My britax is comfy for at least 15 minutes but after that? My boobies are sore, babies face is smashed, and my neck/back hurt. When I first bought it/tried it, it felt great.   I'm poking around the subreddit looking for advice. I think I'd go with performance if possible because I could see myself/hubby wearing her this summer at markets/festivals/etc."
babywearing,1y49az,Axora,2,Mon Feb 17 05:40:00 2014 UTC,I think you're going to really like the Ergo. Especially if a soft-structured carrier is what you want.   I got the Moby wrap when my son was five months old. Holy crap what a waste.   I love my Ergo so far!

I put my son in the Ergo on my back and wear him while I take the dogs out; it's the only way.  And I squat; bending over is much more difficult to do.    I don't know how my husband does it.  He takes our son with him while he took both dogs and he never wore him.  He just took them all together.  Sometimes, though, he puts our toddler down (he's 20 months) and lets him ""walk"" one of the dogs.  We rehomed our minpin last April and are rehoming our pug this week actually.  In the interview process right now to find a good family.  I'm 20 weeks pregnant, we live on the 3rd floor, and I know I'm going to come to a point where I won't be able to take him out reasonably.  He'd have a much better time with a family that can.  I don't feel comfortable leaving my toddler inside for any period of time without supervision to take my son out.  We used to live in a first floor, so I could watch him through the sliding door, but now I can't as we are on the 3rd floor."

My DD HATES being put into carriers, but once she's IN them, she loves it! And when I introduce her to a new carrier, it usually takes a minute or two for her to get used to it, it's a new position, a new distribution of weight, and I think that newness kind of scares her a bit (It probably would me, too!). But when I'm calm and confident, she responds to that! Don't give up, momma! My LO is only 4 months right now, but I know my parents carried me in a structured, back-pack style carrier (much like the ones you're looking at) until I was about 2. Good luck on your adventure!"

I've also found when introducing a new carrier, the best time (for me) is when my baby is fed, awake, and happy. She loves to bounce, so I'll bounce her around a bit to bring back a motion that is familiar and comforting, and soon she's happy as can be! I especially love carrying her back-pack style in my ergo when I'm cooking, it makes it sooo much easier! And remember, babies are so much more adaptable than we are-so if you can do it, your LO can too! :)"

babywearing,1xuaxw,birdsaregross,2,Fri Feb 14 00:18:21 2014 UTC,"I still wear my 17.5 month old.  So much easier when vacationing & going placed that you can't have a stroller.  We use the Beco Gemini- it goes up to ~35 lbs.  you can wear kiddo on front (in or out), back, and on the hip.  It's super easy to use after you figure it out!"
babywearing,1xuaxw,birdsaregross,2,Fri Feb 14 02:38:26 2014 UTC,"When my son was young I tried multiple times to wear him in wraps and he hated it too. I thought it was just being carried that he hated, but it was the type of carrier. I tried a sling carry a couple of months later and he was cool with it and then like 5 months after that I tried a soft structured carrier and we both loved it so much that we still use it almost every day. It's definitely worth it to keep trying and find what works best for the both of you!"
babywearing,1xuaxw,Anchored2Hope,0,Fri Feb 14 04:46:30 2014 UTC,My SO is leaning towards a Kelty 2.0 because he loves the brand and he also thinks it will feel better than a soft carrier. Any thoughts there? Thanks!
babywearing,1xuaxw,Anchored2Hope,2,Fri Feb 14 08:59:43 2014 UTC,"I hadn't heard of the kelty so I looked it up... wow it looks intense! It seems to look good for hiking and outdoorsy adventures. I think a soft structured carrier (like ergo or beco or emeibaby etc) would be easier for traveling within a city. I have an emeibaby and I love it, it's very comfortable for long stretches of time and it really adjusts to fit both myself and my husband. With the kelty, while it looks like it would be great for doubling as a diaper bag etc, it seems like it would get heavy and uncomfortable fast. And personally, I would be hesitant to get something so bulky. Do you know anyone who has either type of carrier that you could borrow from and test out before committing? That would be handy."
babywearing,1xuaxw,TacticalOgre,1 point,Fri Feb 14 17:41:32 2014 UTC,"Intense is a good way to describe it! My SO is used to carrying huge packs like that so he doesn't understand why I think it seems so cumbersome. I don't know anyone that has any kind of baby carrier, unfortunately.

babywearing,1xsmrp,I3km,2,Sun Feb 16 02:46:21 2014 UTC,"I have a BB2 and it was great for getting littler babies on the back. However the panel became quite restrictive sometime after 12 months. I couldnt get it adjusted just right any more. I bought a Boba 4G and its pretty easy to do back carries (16 mo, 22 lb), and get the carrier on. Plus can breastfeed  while walking through the airport.  Back carries after a certain baby age are more about practice."
babywearing,1xqija,SweetThursday424,2,Wed Feb 12 20:14:04 2014 UTC,"I have a Beco Butterfly 2 and a Boba 4g. My 16 month old is just now at 22lbs, and uh...76cm, 79cm tall? I forget (30ish inches I guess). Anyhow, I loved the Beco for when she was smaller, but found it tight (the BB2 has that internal yoke so this may not apply) after about 12+ months. I still love the Boba and use it regularly. At this age I almost exclusively do back carries. Did with my older child as well, front carries become uncomfortable for me after a certain height/weight. IMO. So, my thoughts on (the admittedly different model of) the Beco. Those 2 handed buckles did become annoying. The Boba buckles are stiff enough (and out of reach) that the lack of that safety feature is a complete non-issue. My style of babywearing is for walks and at the store so I don't think a side carry would suit me and I like back carries over front facing out carries for my comfort.   I like my Beco for smaller babies (that's why I bought the BB2 specifically, easy back carries for younger babies), and am not getting rid of it or anything, though I have packed it away until the next kid, but am finding the Boba really fantastic all around (built in tiny pockets omg).   Otherwise construction of the carriers is much of a muchness. Belts are similar, shoulders are similar and so on."
babywearing,1xqija,I3km,2,Wed Feb 12 22:09:49 2014 UTC,I have a Lillebaby. I got it when she was 12 weeks old. I tried and returned a lot of different carriers before I found this one. You can go to their website to watch videos. Works for all sizes and tons of carrying positions. Also love that the seat adjusts to be narrower or wider. It is great! If you get it at bed bath & beyond you can use a 20% coupon to make it $90!
babywearing,1xqija,Emckey,1 point,Thu Feb 13 04:13:33 2014 UTC,I have the beco soliel and also have an ergo. I got the beco after having the ergo for awhile because you have an option to criss cross the back straps which feels better on my back. As for the two handed buckles the can be a pain. That is one thing I do like better about my ergo.
babywearing,1xm2n0,jillianjillianjiggs,2,Tue Feb 11 14:08:36 2014 UTC,"Well... I'm in a couple different baby wearing groups (on Facebook that meet in my town), an I've never heard any of this stuff. Yes there are mamas who are super into different styles and have TONS of different carriers, some very expensive, but they've never told someone ""oh you HAVE to buy this..."" In fact they share patterns on how to make their own and where to buy good second hand ones. I don't know maybe I just missed all the drama."
babywearing,1xm2n0,sfak,2,Wed Feb 12 00:06:33 2014 UTC,"The only carriers I flinch at are the crotch danglers. I realize that further research has shown these may not be as bad as once thought, but... they just straight up look uncomfy.  That said, I'd never go tell someone in public ""ZOMG THAT CARRIER IS BAAAAAD!"" - I just don't recommend them when someone asks.   All my carriers are hand-me-downs, and if they (safely) carry my baby and work for me, that's all I need. And that's all ANYONE really needs."
babywearing,1xm2n0,fsr87,3,Tue Feb 11 15:17:31 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I've seen some that look uncomfortable, but unless someone is dangling their baby in a dangerous manner, or the child looks like they are having trouble breathing or something like that, I can't imagine confronting someone about their carrier."
babywearing,1xm2n0,LynnyLee,1 point,Tue Feb 11 23:55:59 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I kind of flinch at the crotch danglers myself. And I didn't use the Snugli my mother carried me in because I felt like it didn't support my baby's back. But as another article I read when I first started carrying pointed out, it's more like good babywearing and better babywearing. There is pretty much no bad babywearing.  I had been on my husband's case to get a toddler KP to replace our Ergo, and this was a welcome reminder to me to back the eff off."
babywearing,1xiuvb,briannalk,3,Mon Feb 10 15:18:59 2014 UTC,Time to move out of the stretchy wrap. A woven or hybrid will be more secure. He might be big enough to use the ergo with out the insert. The versatility of a woven is one of it's biggest strengths. I would look into a blend. I have a Natibaby hemp blend and it was soft and cushy after the first wash.
babywearing,1xiuvb,Julepwa,1 point,Tue Feb 11 00:08:44 2014 UTC,Good tips -- thanks. I think we'll try the ergo again and see if that helps. My big fear is that anything that restricts his head is going to lead to screaming....

Sleeping on the chest of the mother keeps time for the baby's body and stimulates it to regulate and to keep breathing--the exact OPPOSITE of SIDS!  Wrap that baby up!

babywearing,1wul5o,ethereal_pixie,9,Mon Feb 3 02:28:20 2014 UTC,"Wat? Id ask for some proof on that. That sounds ridiculous. I, and countless mamas I know, have worn baby in a sling or wrap. She'd take the best, longest naps in our baby ktan.  Edited to add: I thought sleeping on tummy was supposedly bad bc baby could get their face smooshed into the crib mattress and not be strong enough to move."
babywearing,1wul5o,sfak,11,Mon Feb 3 00:42:01 2014 UTC,"Tummy sleeping is bad because it has a higher correlation with SIDS than back sleeping. They still don't know what actually causes SIDS, what you mentioned would have been asphyxiation, which obviously is also bad. Presumably, the concern with the wrap is also asphyxiation, but you'd have to be not paying attention so hard to not notice with baby in a wrap. IMO tucked in close to mama's chest is the safest place for babe to be."
babywearing,1wul5o,Kappa_the_imp,1 point,Mon Feb 3 01:18:44 2014 UTC,"I admit I haven't done a ton of reading on SIDS, and I never understood if stomach sleeping contributed to overall risk, or if it was the actual act of stomach sleeping that caused SIDS. I guess it probably isn't known overall? I just know all her grunts and snorts and sighs still make me nervous 4 weeks in."
babywearing,1wul5o,Kappa_the_imp,5,Mon Feb 3 03:03:57 2014 UTC,"Do yourself a favor and don't! Once you know about safe sleep habits, reading more will just freak you out. And it's not the grunts and snorts and sighs that are scary, it's the standing there in the middle of the night staring at baby's little tummy trying to tell if there's any breathing going on. Do yourself another favor and try not to do that. Infant breathing tends to naturally stop and start again like sleep apnea. It's nerve wracking as hell to watch."
babywearing,1wul5o,LeahTT,2,Mon Feb 3 13:50:10 2014 UTC,"When I was a baby in the late '70s/early '80s, doctors told our parents to put babies to sleep on their tummies to help avoid SIDS.  Being on tummy doesn't cause SIDS.  We don't know exactly what does..  but it's certainly not being wrapped to mom."
babywearing,1wul5o,FoxyWhite,3,Tue Feb 4 03:39:31 2014 UTC,My son is 8 months now and only sleeps on his tummy. Once they can lift their head up and flip over you get no say so. It wasn't that strange to me because I've never been able to sleep on my back and I'm told my brothers and I were that same as babies. For the first couple months my son would only sleep sitting up for brief periods since we would not lay him on his belly for sleep. Once he learned to flip over himself though he would sleep 8-12 hours on his belly.
babywearing,1wul5o,fancypig,4,Mon Feb 3 12:11:27 2014 UTC,Did your ped mention sleeping in a carrier specifically? I took that as sleeping on a parent's chest while the parent also sleeps.
babywearing,1wul5o,kaceface,2,Mon Feb 3 21:13:10 2014 UTC,"That makes more sense. We were talking about her sleeping on her dad's chest while he was at his desk, which he would put her in the Moby for."
babywearing,1wul5o,eatingaboook,1 point,Mon Feb 3 21:51:39 2014 UTC,"And even that idea seems more like the risk would be accidental asphyxiation if the baby rolls off the parent or maybe crushing by the parent, not SIDS."
babywearing,1wul5o,plasticcastle,3,Tue Feb 4 14:15:18 2014 UTC,"I think the only concern is if you're lying down with the baby in it, and you're asleep... Which doesn't seem likely. As long as you are able to see the baby (pretty easy considering how they sit in a front carrier - it would be hard to not notice a problem) and you yourself are not asleep, I don't see any issue."
babywearing,1wul5o,ShannonOh,3,Mon Feb 3 03:01:21 2014 UTC,"Your doctor is wrong. As long as you use the Moby safely - close enough to kiss, at least a finger width between chin and chest - your baby will be safe and cosy close to you. The benefits are enormous, which is why it's recommended for premature babies."
babywearing,1wul5o,Zombie_Unicorn,2,Mon Feb 3 07:04:59 2014 UTC,I would ask for clarification and whether there is any evidence to back up his claims.
babywearing,1wul5o,SaltyDuchess,1 point,Tue Feb 4 00:01:37 2014 UTC,"Just thought I'd chime in here and say that I have slept tummy to tummy with my son at least half of the time he's been home, and he's 6 weeks old.   Sometimes he's on his side on my chest, or on his side next to me, or on his back next to me.  From what I understand, being in contact with mum or dad helps baby regulate his breathing and sleep lighter - too deep of sleep is one of the possible cause of SIDS.  So yeah, wrap dat baby up real good!"
babywearing,1wujq9,ShannonOh,2,Mon Feb 3 00:11:50 2014 UTC,I switched my 20 pound 9 month-old from the ergo to a toddler tula. It made all the difference in the world. She is almost 14 months now:)

babywearing,1wp4eu,fancypig,3,Sat Feb 1 03:05:35 2014 UTC,That's a great idea. He's just so knockered out by the time we get to our destination it's so easy to leave him sleeping in the carrier.  We may have to play with this a bit to get the logistics worked out.
babywearing,1wp4eu,burdydee,3,Sat Feb 1 07:45:34 2014 UTC,"Does he generally transfer easily while sleeping? I could pop my kiddo out and into a carrier and she would sleep through it or settle right back down, but I know not all babies will if that. Pre-tying the moby will make the process quicker. My personal favorite carrier for shopping is a ring sling."
babywearing,1wp4eu,yespls,2,Sat Feb 1 09:17:22 2014 UTC,"I'm in the middle of the vortex too, I do this and I just pull baby out of seat, cover with blanket and put him in carrier as soon as I get indoors. That way there is no rushing"
babywearing,1wp4eu,ittybittypittie,2,Mon Feb 3 20:43:10 2014 UTC,I second this.  It's been snowing consistently here for the last few weeks and this has been my strategy as well.
babywearing,1wp4eu,ShannonOh,5,Sat Feb 1 05:44:41 2014 UTC,"I often get inside first then put the kids in the ring sling.  A Moby is only comfy until about 15lbs so it would be worth looking into a woven wrap rather than a stretchy wrap or a structured carrier like an Ergo or Boba.  Ring slings are my go-to for shopping trips with my 20.5""lb 13 month old.  Edit: Target has a decent selection including Ergos and a nice inexpensive mei tai by Infantino. I know a lot of people that wear their toddlers."
babywearing,1wp4eu,knottymommy,1 point,Sat Feb 1 03:12:05 2014 UTC,This. Put carrier on in the store. I love RSs for quick trips and small babies. If I'm shopping for a while I'll use a woven wrap.
babywearing,1wp4eu,ShannonOh,2,Sun Feb 2 21:19:57 2014 UTC,"I put a carrier under my coat (stretchy wrap or ring sling) and pop them in quick and cover with coat.  They're always in a lightweight fleece in the car, so they're never that cold.  If it's too cold to even take that long or I want to do a back carry or use something that doesn't work well under my coat, I just pop them out and tuck under my coat or wrap them in a blanket or in their ponchos until we get inside then get them situated in the carrier once we're out of the cold.  If I'm going to be walking outside, I have a babywearing coat with an opening on the back.  I'll get one of the girls in the carrier on my back and then put the coat on over both of us.  As long as we're both wearing a fleece jacket over our inside clothes and we're out of the wind, it's not too bad even when it's really cold."
babywearing,1wp4eu,knottymommy,2,Sat Feb 1 18:59:46 2014 UTC,"There are a very wide array of styles. Woven wraps have the highest learning curve but the most versatility. Ring slings are fabulous for their simplicity and comfort, and was of nursing, but they aren't as great when baby gets bigger as they're one-shouldered. RSs also can't be use on the back (or at least not as safely, IMHO). Soft, structured carriers (SSCs) are often a great carrier for people who want only one carrier for everything (eg Ergo, Kinderpack, Tula). Mei-tais are super easy and can be used for back and front, though they may be less comfy than the SSC.   And there are many more!   As for when to stop...just like breast feeding. Whenever it's not working for both carrier and carry-ee!"
babywearing,1wp4eu,ShannonOh,2,Sun Feb 2 21:24:57 2014 UTC,"Why don't you think a back carry with a ring sling is safe?  I wouldn't use a ring sling for a back carry with a baby that didn't have complete head control, but when done correctly it's perfectly safe for an older child."
babywearing,1wp4eu,knottymommy,1 point,Mon Feb 3 04:50:04 2014 UTC,"I don't find it as safe. It is hard to adjust but up to the shoulders and out to the knees.  Movement from the arm to adjust often changes the balance of the carry. It just doesn't seem as secure as wraps, SSCs, and MTs to me. I realize it is possible, so I tried to couch my comment by saying it's not as safe, and in my opinion (IMHO)."
babywearing,1wp4eu,ShannonOh,1 point,Mon Feb 3 12:43:46 2014 UTC,Fair enough.  Those are all good reasons to wait until the child has complete head control/is sitting unassisted.   I always get my girls situated on my hip first so I can get everything adjusted properly.   Then I just slide them to the back and tighten the last bit out.

babywearing,1wp4eu,ShannonOh,1 point,Mon Feb 3 13:11:49 2014 UTC,"It's definitely not as comfortable to have all the weight on one shoulder.  If I end up using a ring sling for longer than I planned, I'll take a supportive scarf or short wrap (you could use a second ring sling, too) and tie it rebozo style over the whole ring sling setup but over the opposite shoulder.  It provides support more like a two shoulder wrap carry and reduces that ability to lean as well.  There's also the RUB (rings under bum) where it functions more like a short woven in a simple ruck carry....if your ring sling is long enough."
babywearing,1wp4eu,knottymommy,1 point,Mon Feb 3 13:34:03 2014 UTC,Interesting! I've never tried RUBing. I'll give it a go.

babywearing,1vqoz3,msuaussiemom,2,Tue Jan 21 11:59:16 2014 UTC,"I'm going to second the idea of a Mei Tai. My daughter ha always been small for her age, so we stuck to wraps and such for a while. By far my favorite was my woven Mei Tai carrier, the hip carry was easy and comfortable for both of us. Although, now that my twins are toddlers and my son finally likes to be worn we use soft structure carriers for the extra support and the amazingly comfortable back carry."

babywearing,1vqoz3,dinahsaurus,3,Fri Jan 24 05:23:20 2014 UTC,"You may want to just try a woven wrap.  Moby wraps are really really long and stretchy, and you can get a woven that is shorter (so less fabric to fight with), and it provides a ton more support because it doesn't stretch."
babywearing,1vqoz3,that_girl13,2,Tue Jan 21 17:08:09 2014 UTC,You will run into the same problem with the k'tan as you did the moby; support. Because of the material it's made from there's not much support past about 15lbs. You could try a woven wrap but those also take time. I suggest trying a wrap conversion ring sling. You get the support of a woven wrap with the ease of not having to wrap and tie it.
babywearing,1vqoz3,crazyfordisney,2,Tue Jan 21 11:59:26 2014 UTC,"Check out the Maya Wrap. I have used it since my daughter was a week old, she is now 1 year old and I love it even more. The hip carry is soooo easy in it. The only carry I had difficulty with was the front kangaroo style but that's bc my LO wanted to try and stand up in the wrap every time."

babywearing,1vqoz3,ShannonOh,2,Tue Jan 21 21:10:52 2014 UTC,"A good, non-stretchy ring sling will do what you're looking for. Pops in and out easy, swings to the hip pretty easily, and swings down for nursing if you would like that too.   Wraps have a learning curve but ring slings are definitely my favorite for easy in and out."
babywearing,1v6wgo,cyphered,3,Tue Jan 14 14:22:00 2014 UTC,I found this blog helpful: http://themommydialogues.com/splurge-vs-budget-babywearing-edition/.   For each carrier type they gave a splurge and budget option that they felt was best.  I'm in the US and don't know which are available elsewhere - but the reviews they have done in the past have been thorough and seem well thought out.
babywearing,1v6wgo,staplegunsarefun,1 point,Tue Jan 14 17:41:13 2014 UTC,This is awesome! Exactly what I need :) Annoyingly a lot of the brands aren't available in the UK but it at least gives me an idea of what to look for!
babywearing,1v6wgo,Flewtea,2,Tue Jan 14 17:57:17 2014 UTC,"There are lots of women with more experience here than I who can help you, but I would say this is one thing not to skimp on if you can possibly help it. Spend the money to get a good woven (if you have the willingness to get over the learning curve) or soft-structured carrier and get bargains on the baby's clothes, etc. Mine's a Lillebaby ($135 USD) and it's been amazing and I definitely don't need any other. Check for secondhand carriers around you. If you do get a wrap and it doesn't work out, they hold resale value very well, so you wouldn't lose much of the purchase price.  I will say that I loved the Moby a friend gave me for when she was a newborn and if we have another, I would really like to get a woven. However, I do love how quick my Lillebaby is--I can pop her on and off my back in under a minute just to sweep the floor. If you want easy on and off with little learning curve, soft structured offers the most variety and any of the best-known brands would probably make you happy."
babywearing,1v6wgo,Flewtea,1 point,Tue Jan 14 15:31:02 2014 UTC,"Thanks for responding! To be honest I'm kind of confused about  the difference  between woven wraps and any other  kind. Are they different  to the stretchy jersey-type fabric wraps? I saw those first and saw a simple tutorial on how to tie them, which looked  really good and exactly the type of thing I was looking for. The prices aren't too bad either, especially if I can carry on using it when the sprog gets older.   My concern was seeing some people who struggle  to tie it and end up giving up. I have a fair amount of patience  but if I'm exhausted anyway from all the other new-baby stuff I don't want  something that's crazy hard to get to grips with.  The tie I saw involved putting the middle  of the wrap at your waist, at the  front, crossing the two ends over your back and shoulders, then pulling them through the middle  bit which is at your waist, and wrapping them around  yourself  a few times to secure  it. It seemed really easy and if that's pretty much it I'm sure I could manage. And it seems this kind are pretty versatile too so as he gets older  I could try out other ties, have him on my back or to one side or something."
babywearing,1v6wgo,ilikesnowflakes,3,Tue Jan 14 15:48:00 2014 UTC,"There are a lot of differences between the stretchy and non-stretchy. The stretchy ones have much more limited-use, both in time and carrying positions. They're great and cuddly for tiny newborns but even by the time mine was 10lbs, it sagged too much too quickly to be comfortable and efficient. You also cannot do back carries with them and your back really is where you want them as soon as you can--it's the easiest way to still get things done around the house, especially things like cooking that are too dangerous to do with them on your front. The stretchy ones are more forgiving at first when you're figuring out how to tie them but it still took me a couple weeks to get really comfortable with it. The actual tie is easy but figuring out how much tension needs to be where and how high to place the different crosses is not. Once I did, though, the stretch bugged me and I would have rather had a true woven.  Wovens also come in different lengths, both so that larger and smaller women have good options and based on what carries you want to do. The stretchy ones will usually land you with a few feet of excess fabric to tuck in although the longer wovens will do the same.  If you want all the versatility you can get, a woven is the way to go--back carries with a newborn! If you want a good combination of ease and versatility, the route we went worked fairly well. Stretchy wrap for the first couple months and then a carrier--try find one that doesn't need an infant insert. The downside to this route is that you have to wait longer to do back carries with a carrier because you can't get them as high up."
babywearing,1v6wgo,fancypig,1 point,Tue Jan 14 19:01:24 2014 UTC,"Ahh, thank you so much! This really helps :) it makes a lot of sense now why many sites seemed to really like the woven ones. I found a great UK based site that stocks a ton of different ones, plus mei tai carriers at really good prices, so I might be able to go down the route of getting two different ones, one for the first couple months and another for when he gets a bit bigger."

babywearing,1uzyjp,happyplains,4,Sun Jan 12 01:10:42 2014 UTC,"You could try a front cross carry with your Moby. It's pretty similar to the typical Moby carry but without the wrap around the front part.   If you really like carrying her but want some variety, I strongly suggest looking into buying a woven wrap. You can get much more versatility in both size and types of carries because you can start wrapping on your back. Most people find the Moby to have too much fabric for what they need, which makes it a hassle."
babywearing,1uzyjp,kaceface,2,Sun Jan 12 01:42:58 2014 UTC,"I love front cross carry but I would not recommend it with a stretchy wrap like the moby.

It's comfy, quick, all the positions work well, cool in the summer, and she's happy in it for hours. If it had a pocket, it'd be perfect--that's my only complaint. Let me know if you have any other questions about it!"

I am going to give it a shot!  Perhaps I did not find it in search because it was not in the title of a post. Because now when I search this subreddit only my post comes up....weird!"
babywearing,1uyssi,Flewtea,1 point,Sat Jan 11 18:57:45 2014 UTC,"That was pretty much my thought too. :) And the forward-facing is safe, unlike the Bjorn. I will say we don't use FF anymore because she's too heavy and is tall enough that it's easier to just stick her on my back, but when she was under 6 months and too little for the back carry (it really took more till about 8 months for her to grow into the wide setting, since she's pretty small) it was great. I was really tempted by a couple of the Beco carriers too. I honestly can't remember now what it was that swayed me to the Lillebaby but if you don't have somewhere to try them, I doubt you'd be unhappy with either. Also, we got the Organic, mostly for color selection honestly. We were told by the owner of a babywearing website not to bother getting the sport versions because they're not much cooler (it's baby being pressed up against you that's the issue) and the support materials degrade a little faster.  Edit: I think it might have been a combination of price and that the Lillebaby had higher weight limits. I wanna say there was something else too but I can't remember. I do like the prints on the Gemini better, though."

It includes more than other carriers and the fact that it has 6 carrying potions is great.  It is awesome.   They just launched carriers with a pocket, by the way. We don’t have it in yet but I saw it at a tradeshow last fall.   The Beco Gemini  is not as good. The seat is very narrow and it is thick with rough fabric. More importantly the Beco quality is simply horrible. I don’t know what happened, but it has been really bad the past year. I would not recommend it anyway – we stopped carrying it.   If you considered buying a babybjorn or Ergo you should absolutely choose the lillebaby COMPLETE – it is like the two combined in one carrier. And it is less expensive too."

babywearing,1u1iq7,I-heart-naps,3,Mon Dec 30 20:53:47 2013 UTC,You can tuck his legs in if it looks uncomfortable. Pull his knees into his tummy abit and sit him froggy style in the carrier. I did this with my son for a while in the Ergo because it felt like his hips just weren't ready to support being stretched.
babywearing,1u1iq7,bnthrdntht,5,Tue Dec 31 10:17:48 2013 UTC,His knees should be bent for proper positioning. You can fold up a receiving blanket to mimic the bottom portion of the infant insert. This will boost him up inside the carrier and allow him to bend his legs.

I live in Alaska, if I'm going to put LO in it - it is either to A. run errands or B. hiking/outdoorsy stuff. It takes too dag gone long to put on for errands (and it requires me to stand outside when getting her out of the car, and well... its cold here) and for hiking and outdoorsy stuff its just not comfortable enough for hiking. I sold mine on the swap. I would rather have a ringsling for errands and either my ergo or my hiking pack for outdoorsy stuff! (When the monster was little I loved the K'tan!)

babywearing,1tpxxu,Sinafey,1 point,Thu Dec 26 05:50:36 2013 UTC,"I actually just made my own using 2.5 yards of wicking athletic mesh with no length-wise stretch, and the Sleeping Baby Productions tutorial: htltp://www.sleepingbaby.net/jan/Baby/sling.html  She explains everything very clearly (and responds to questions via email) so if you have basic sewing skills that's the way to go. I love her pleated shoulder style, and it works great for almost all body types.   The Zanytoes Splash has a shoulder that spreads out wider over your shoulder, which restricts your arm movement a bit more than the pleated style - especially if you're petite.   The TaylorMade is kind of the opposite of the Zanytoes. It has fewer pleats, so will be narrower on your shoulder. That's not a big deal with small babies, but having all of baby's weight concentrated on one shoulder can be uncomfortable to begin with, not spreading it out will make it even more so.   I've never used either for bathing, only for swimming or the beach. To be honest, I don't really ""get"" how you use the sling in the shower. I can't see how you could clean baby if you have the sling safely snug, and for me shower time gives a precious few moments to myself ;)"
babywearing,1tmpru,eryoshi,14,Tue Dec 24 21:10:19 2013 UTC,"As long as baby is in a safe and comfortable position (high enough to kiss the top of his/her head, upright, seated squat position with knees slightly higher than bum) you can wear for as long as you both are comfortable!  Baby's optimal environment is his mother or other caregiver, there is a concept called the ""niche"" that touches on this. Never feel that you need to put your baby down for any reason other than your own (we all need our space from time to time), you cannot spoil them by meeting their need for physical contact and they grow too quickly to not enjoy those sweet baby snuggles."

If she/he is uncomfortable at first go for a small walk around the block, I find that helps when I get a new wrap. Kind of 'breaking it in', so to speak, and getting my LO used to it. We are 8 months in and I'm wearing her in a woven right now while I'm surfing reddit and she is happily asleep. :)"
babywearing,1tmpru,bnthrdntht,2,Wed Dec 25 06:19:31 2013 UTC,"A baby's natural habitat is your bosom. Whether you are breastfeeding or not our infants are born with the innate sense that safety is as close to mom as possible. So long as baby's chin is not touching his or her's chest, you can kiss baby's head, and their body is supported correctly creating an M shape with their but low and knees up carry them as much as you want."
babywearing,1tmpru,Wdc331,2,Wed Dec 25 21:01:28 2013 UTC,"Just our experience but my baby hated the Moby (she tolerated it a few times during those sleepy first few weeks and then was like, ""Hell no!"") She didn't care much for the ergo with infant insert but now likes it (well, tolerates it) since we stopped using it with the insert. We also have a Bjorn and have tried a few others. Basically, she will tolerate being worn but really prefers her stroller.   Your baby will tell you when he wants out. Babies are very good communicators, especially once you're past the initial 2 weeks. And every baby seems different. What one baby loves, another hates. And what a baby doesn't like one week, may be a favorite the next.   Personally, I didn't care much for the Moby but there are some who swear by them. For me, the Ergo has been much more useful."
babywearing,1tmpru,SaltyDuchess,1 point,Sun Dec 29 01:38:54 2013 UTC,"If squish is happy in it (ie asleep!), keep them there as long as you want in my opinion. It probably will take time to build up your tolerance to it tho."
babywearing,1tlqhb,Wdc331,5,Tue Dec 24 12:41:23 2013 UTC,I know there has been a TON of negative responses to the 360; but I believe in Ergo as a company and I really think they have put a lot of thought/research into the carrier. It may not be for everyone/every baby; but it will offer a better forward facing alternative to the crotch danglers. I think an older baby (older than 6 months or so) would be fine FFing for short outings. My kiddos were fine in the Ergo facing me until they could be on my back; but every once in a while a FFing carrier would have been cool (like at the zoo or aquarium).
babywearing,1tlqhb,Anchored2Hope,2,Tue Dec 24 13:31:05 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I understand the issue with FF carriers from a physical perspective (both for the child and the parent) but not from a cognitive/developmental perspective. And I agree all babies are different; some may very well get overstimulated from looking forward for too long, while others won't. I know my baby will like having the option so we will probably get one as soon as it's available. I tried the more expensive bjorns and while they face outward, the carrier itself just adds too much weight. I love the Ergo because the design is pretty simple and the carrier itself is light while still providing some decent back support."
babywearing,1tlqhb,Flewtea,4,Tue Dec 24 15:16:51 2013 UTC,"There have been plenty of safe ways to carry babies forward-facing for a while now. I distinctly remember reading an article on Ergo's blog when I was doing my research on which carrier to buy about how terrible forward facing was for kids. But now, all of a sudden it's not so bad, now that they have a product that does it? Color me skeptical. I will not buy a 360 or likely any other Ergo because I feel like they were purposely misleading people for profit."
babywearing,1tlqhb,Flewtea,1 point,Tue Dec 24 15:21:06 2013 UTC,"From what I was reading, Ergobaby still claims that inward facing is best. But they have made this product in response to consumer demand. I guess they felt they were loosing too many customers to Bjorn and other carriers that provide a forward facing option.   Is there actually any research out there to support the ""inward is best"" theory? The only thing I have noticed is that inward facing is easier for me (I don't arch my back as much). But for the baby? Meh, I'm skeptical. And while I realize the crotch danglers aren't ideal, 2 pediatricians have now told me that they aren't as horrible as they are made out to be. They are definitely something to be avoided for any baby that has hip issues already and shouldn't be used for really long periods of time, but for short sessions they are fine.   It's so frustrating that so many claims are made without a lot of evidence to back them up. That said, I have been liking the ergo. For me, it's the most comfortable carrier I've been able to find."
babywearing,1tlqhb,Flewtea,2,Tue Dec 24 15:29:10 2013 UTC,"To my mind, if you don't offer something because you claim it's unsafe, you don't turn around and offer it because you're losing money.  And no, there is no research that I've ever seen. Women have been carrying their babies outwards in wraps for a very long time. Hell, there are whole cultures who avoid eye contact at all, in any circumstance, and their babies turn out to be perfectly functional human beings. But yes, the weight is distributed less ideally when facing out. However, my Lillebaby does it just fine and I can carry her perfectly ergonomically (for her) for quite a while. I don't think many people in this sub argue that Bjorns are all together evil but I see many women posting about how they expect it to be their only carrier, and pictures on facebook of people taking their babies on hikes in them. That's what I think most people are warning against."
babywearing,1tlqhb,Flewtea,1 point,Tue Dec 24 15:47:33 2013 UTC,"Ouch. Hiking with a Bjorn? I can't wear mine for about 30 minutes before my back really hurts.   Did Ergo claim that outward facing was unsafe? The only thing I ever saw on their website was that they claimed inward facing was developmentally more appropriate/beneficial because outward facing can cause the baby to be overstimulated.   But I totally agree with you -- I seriously don't think outward facing is bad. So much of this baby shit is totally over thought (IMO). If some of this was so bad, there would be far more dysfunctional people out there running around. Besides, I feel like I've got to give my kid something to talk about in therapy 20 years from now (kidding! kidding!)  Do you like the Lillebaby? Is the carrier itself pretty light? That's one carrier I've had my eyes on and I may get it. My concern is whether it is light enough so that the carrier itself doesn't weigh me down along with the baby. I'm pretty small (barely 5 feet tall) and I have ended up with a rather long and skinny baby girl (genetics be weird). Do you find the Lillebaby easy to put on?  How do you use it?"
babywearing,1tlqhb,PopOkat,1 point,Tue Dec 24 16:03:53 2013 UTC,"Here are Ergo's three blog posts on the matter. It seems I did misspeak and they never said all forward facing was unsafe, but the message is pretty loud and clear to me: Don't Do It. They gloss over that there are and always have been plenty of ways to FFO safely without dangling and only focus on those carriers and the supposed over-stimulation. All three posts certainly don't recommend it but that's exactly what they're advertising now! Combine that with what I've heard about their shady business practices and I will just stay away.  So, while I don't own an Ergo, I love my Lillebaby! I didn't have the chance to try other carriers really and just did a lot of blog review and forum research and thus am not the best person to ask for comparisons but I've been quite happy. I just weighed myself with and without it and it said it only weighed a pound. I'd guess more like a pound and a bit but either way, it's very light and we have the Organic, not the sport version. I love that you don't need an infant insert, that it comes with a lumbar support (even though I'm too small to use it, my husband isn't), and that I can easily change how wide the seat is. I also like that I can snap the seatback up once she gets taller (which is going to be soon) to get longer wear out of it but not drown a really little one.  The things I don't like are there's no easy way to store the sleeping hood while on to keep it wrapped up and out of the way and there's no pocket. I usually just leave the sleeping hood off since she rarely falls asleep in it and there are hooks on it that I can attach a carabiner to and then hang a pouch or purse or toy off of but it's not quite as convenient as a pocket. I also wish the webbing stayed wrapped up in the elastics better--it always comes out and dangles--but I don't know that there's much can be done about that.  It would definitely fit your baby easily but you might want to try one on (or ask Rachel at Quirky Baby if she knows) because the chest clip might ride up a little high on you. It's almost too high on me and I'm 5'7"" but I also have very narrow shoulders (I still need the straps all the way pulled in), so I don't know how it would do for you.  I use it for periods longer than 45 minutes fairly infrequently. We did take her on a 2-hour hike in it once in the summer and she was happy the whole time. I've used all the carries in it and usually just use the basic back or front. She's tall enough to see over my shoulder now, so she doesn't need the FFO but she loved it when she was smaller."

babywearing,1t3vl6,jezzela,10,Tue Dec 17 19:04:04 2013 UTC,"$50 is a steal for an Ergo.  Make sure it's authentic, though, because they are often counterfeited.  Does counterfeiting matter?  Yes, because it jeopardizes the safety of the carrier.  Ergo has attempted to counter this by having their authorized retailers public on their website.  We bought the Ergo when my son was 8 months.  It has been a lifesaver.  It took a while to figure out how to nurse in it, but that's because I had him too snug to do so, but now I love it.  I'll go shopping and nurse him at the same time and no one's the wiser.  Here we are hiking with him in it."
babywearing,1t3vl6,cgsf,4,Tue Dec 17 19:31:51 2013 UTC,"We had a Bjorn but after talking with moms in the neighborhood and seeing them walk around happily with Ergos, I said to heck with it and went shopping for one. Best. thing. ever. I stopped dreading our walks out.  Baby outgrew the Bjorn (that my husband insisted on using himself) so he finally tried out the Ergo last month. Before we even stepped outside, he exclaimed, ""I can see why you like this!"""
babywearing,1t3vl6,happyeggeater,6,Tue Dec 17 20:00:29 2013 UTC,"Depends on what you're looking for overall. Just for you or switching with Dad frequently? High back carry or anything on your back will do? In and out quickly or you don't mind taking a couple minutes?  I would recommend getting something other than the Bjorn, though--they aren't good for baby's hips if you wear her a lot. The Ergo should definitely be more comfortable for you, but try it on with her first if at all possible. See if there's a babywearing group in your area or a store that sells carriers because if you want a soft-structured carrier, there are many different very good options that all fit slightly differently. I have a Lillebaby (you can face them outwards safely) and really like it. Beco is another very good brand. $50 is a great price, just make sure that it does everything you want it to do and is comfortable on you first.  Edit: A couple other thoughts. The Ergo has a pretty short back to it--if yours tends on the long side, it may not last as long. Also, you're buying this used or as a second and are sure it's an Ergo, right? There are a lot of counterfeits out there that aren't made to the same standards."
babywearing,1t3vl6,Flewtea,2,Tue Dec 17 19:17:44 2013 UTC,"For $50, I'd go for it.  It would help with all those needs you're having with the Bjorn."

She initially hated the Ergo but has started to tolerate it now that she's a bit older and bigger (we no longer use the infant insert). We also have an original Bjorn. I think my baby prefers to be carried facing out because she likes to see what is going on. But the Bjorn original is hell on my back. We started practicing with the Ergo around the house and she slowly started to really like it. But it took practice! She will not tolerate it for short shopping trips. She still prefers her stroller, but sometimes I just need my hands free to push a shopping cart or do other things.   I am pretty petite and do find babywearing in general a little hard on my body. The Ergo is definitely the most comfortable carrier I've tried. I tested some of the more expensive Bjorns and just found that the carrier itself added too much weight and had too much stuff to make it comfortable. The Ergo (IMO) seems to offer support while still keeping bulk to a minimum.   Yes, you can nurse in the Ergo, but it does take practice. There are some YouTube videos showing you how to do this. Basically, you have to loosen the straps and position the baby. It's tricky, but I have done it a few times when she started to get fussy. It is definitely something you have to practice. Also, I am pretty small chested so find it a bit trickier (I think larger boobs would make this easier)."
babywearing,1t474v,kt4softball,2,Tue Dec 17 21:04:44 2013 UTC,"My only advice with regard to baby carriers is buy with the knowledge that your baby may hate them. We have the Moby and baby only used it twice before she decided that she absolutely hated it. We have the Ergo with infant insert and she hated that too until she was big enough to not need the infant insert. At 13 weeks, she will not tolerate the Ergo for short periods of time (less than an hour) when we are out running errands or doing things around the house. She doesn't love it the way she loves her stroller but will tolerate it.   Also, the Ergo is supposedly coming out with a new carrier this spring that will allow for forward-facing carrying. My baby loves facing out (we have a Baby Bjorn that I will sometimes use for short periods of time around the house, but it is hell on my back and the hip position is less than ideal). I may get the new Ergo when it's available."
babywearing,1t474v,Wdc331,2,Tue Dec 24 12:19:42 2013 UTC,"I'm a little late in the game, but this chart kind of swayed me away from the Ergo. (See the ""potential negatives"" section... not a very ethical company.)"

We got it when my son was around 8-months so I could begin back-carrying (since we previously used the Moby and you can't back-carry in it) and so we could go hiking.  He's now 18-months and I still use it daily."
babywearing,1t474v,cgsf,1 point,Wed Dec 18 02:03:52 2013 UTC,"Im due end of March and I'm going for the Beco Soleil. It's similar to the Gemini but apparently more well suited to longer walks/hikes etc. I plan to baby wear as much as possible, and plan to spend a lot of time outside with baby strapped in, so that's why I opted for the Soleil. I've heard that many people who tried both the ergo and the gemini liked the gemini better, but that's just what I've seen online. :)   One note - some people say the gemini/soleil are kind of big for newborns, even with the newborn insert. But I've also seen that about the ergo. Probably varies on a baby-to-baby basis. Something like a moby or mei tai might be nice for when they are a newborn."

If he isn't too 'floppy' you could try to teach yourself a back carry, but you should NOT do a back carry with a Moby or any other stretchy wrap. BabywearingFaith has some good tutorial videos. You will probably want a spotter if you're new to wrapping.  You might also try a ring sling and try wearing LO over on your hip. My LO likes that he can see better that way and doesn't focus on my huge boobs as much, plus he isn't front and center on them. I also find, as a bigger-breasted mama, that it's easier to nurse in a ring sling.  If wrapping seems too hard right now you could try an Ergo or another SSC, though that may not help much."

You can tie it so that baby is below your breasts or maybe a low fwcc would work. Maybe even a SSC like an ergo, although some women say those straps still put pressure on their upper breasts. When you use the moby where exactly does it put pressure on your breasts?"
babywearing,1ry24t,squiggywiggle,1 point,Tue Dec 3 00:10:46 2013 UTC,"I started wearing my babe on my back at three months because I felt my boobs got squished in that same way in front carries. I highly suggest a woven wrap! I started with a rucksack carry when she was little, which is the simplest to do, but when she got heavier and I got more confident with wrapping, I switched to the double hammock carry which is very secure and can even be modified to criss cross across your chest like an external bra if you want more support there. :) Good luck!"

It may not be uncomfortable, but it feels different than your arms. Also make sure the wrap is tight enough. Sometimes moms tie them looser thinking that will be more comfy but the security of being snuggles right up to you is important both for LO's comfort and for yours."
babywearing,1rm0is,fouristwo42,8,Thu Nov 28 00:17:46 2013 UTC,Get the Moby. Just do. It's inexpensive amd wonderful for the newborn stage. Don't be afraid of learning to tie it. Its pretty easy. There are also YouTube videos if you want to watch those. Seriously. Its really great.
babywearing,1rm0is,loveintheoven,1 point,Thu Nov 28 02:39:23 2013 UTC,"I got the Moby. I have a 3 week old now, and I'm still too nervous to really wear it around. It's great for calming her when she's fussy, but it still makes me anxious because I don't know how well I feel her head is supported, and I have a hard time really being mobile. The husband really loved it for having her sleep on his chest while he's on his computer, but then our pediatrician told us that baby sleeping tummy to tummy on a parent counts as stomach sleeping and contributes to the SIDS risk, so we stopped.  It's easy to tie and I love it in principle, but I'm still having a hard time working up the nerve to actually use it as intended."

I know some people complain about it being difficult to tie, I just watched a few YouTube videos and got the hang of it really quick. I like that it is versatile, there are a lot of different ways to tie it. I stuck with the (I think) Newborn Hug Hold. It fully supported his head, his legs were froggied inside, and it kept him snuggled up to my chest, which he liked (and has the added bonus that strangers can't try to touch him!) My son absolutely loved it. As soon as he was in it, he would fall asleep. It's just so cozy! They only drawback was that it can get pretty warm in there, so if you live somewhere hot, I wouldn't recommend wearing it for too long. But I found inside my house or the grocery store (where it is cool) was perfect."

babywearing,1rfwpd,eatingaboook,5,Mon Nov 25 20:31:35 2013 UTC,"The Chicco looks like it's from 8-25lbs.  It does look like a narrow seated carrier, so it might not be the most comfortable for your baby.  The strap set up on it looks likely to put all the weight on your shoulders, which could become a literal pain as baby puts on weight.  The Infantino Mei Tai does list an 8lb minimum because it might not fit smaller babies safely.  Here is a video that shows tricks to overcome that.  This is also a very thorough page.  It sounds like your other carrier is a pouch sling.  This page gives very clear directions for determining good fit for a pouch sling.  I love the idea of pouch slings, but when they don't fit perfectly, they are useless.  I've found a ring sling to be much more adaptable.  If you're looking to save some money.  The Babywearer has some great FSOT (For Sale Or Trade) boards.  It also has a great DIY forum, so if you're crafty at all, you can make your own carriers and save a lot.  There are also some great babywearing sale/trade groups on FaceBook.  ""The Babywearing Swap"" is a big one.  There's also ""Babywearing on a Budget"" where only carriers under $100 are listed."
babywearing,1rfwpd,knottymommy,1 point,Mon Nov 25 21:31:49 2013 UTC,"Thank you for all the info and resources! Very helpful. I definitely am okay with getting gently used ones or trading with someone, so I am glad there is a place I can look into doing so.   I agree about the pouch sling, like I said I can already see it will not last long, maybe not at all if our baby is born large. The person who gave it to me wasn't even able to use it at all because it ended up being too small to fit her and the baby (it was a Medium too!) For the mei tai or Chicco, if we do end up using them, what is your take on the 'froggy leg positioning'? I see someone else here suggested it and I have read about it before but it seems uncomfortable (for baby) but I dunno as I'm a FTM.  About ring slings, would you trust ones you find on Etsy? I found a ton of them there that look nice, but my husband was concerned with the quality or strength of them. Is there anything in particular I would look for in one of those? They seem very adaptable since they can be adjusted, I like anything that can be adjusted and used for a much longer time period."
babywearing,1rfwpd,canibuyatrowel,3,Mon Nov 25 21:38:02 2013 UTC,"No no no the froggy leg position is not uncomfortable for a baby. If you let a baby crawl up to you on their own as a newborn, it is the natural way they pull their legs up...it may seem strange now but once your baby is here and you go to put them in the carrier like that, you'll see that they sort of fall into place in a way. My daughter wouldn't go to sleep in the carrier unless her legs were froggied, and we learned to do it from a local natural baby store, as well as classes at our birth center. It is definitely the right thing to do for the baby."
babywearing,1rfwpd,knottymommy,1 point,Mon Nov 25 22:08:41 2013 UTC,Thank you :) I see that it's totally normal and is probably foreign to me because I have never had/been around a newborn baby before. I'll look up some videos on how to do it right :)
babywearing,1rfwpd,that_girl13,2,Mon Nov 25 23:01:46 2013 UTC,"I would be comfortable buying from a member of the BCIA (Baby Carrier Industry Alliance) because you know they are following certain standards.  One I know offhand is BabyEtte  I haven't been able to find anywhere that BCIA Business Members are listed all in one place.  I used the froggy leg positioning with my baby's leg tucked up in the carrier for the first few weeks.  My girls were pretty big at birth, so it didn't take long for them to seem uncomfortable that way.  We tried different positioning until we found what worked for us."
babywearing,1rfwpd,that_girl13,2,Mon Nov 25 21:58:58 2013 UTC,"The mei tai you have is great. I had one and I loved it. When baby is first born you will do what's called froggy his legs (many YouTube videos on that) when in a soft structured carrier, which is what the mei tai is. Legs will go out at maybe a couple months old. That depends on his size, if he's comfortable that way, if you're comfortable that way. As far as the chicco, I personally wouldn't use it. For a full buckle carrier I suggest an ergo or a Tula. Again, he will be froggy in those until his legs are comfortable spread out. Now onto ring slings. That was my first carrier ever and I still use mine now. My daughter is 18 months, 33lbs, 34 inches tall. I love it and I highly recommend them. There is a learning curve to it but to me it was so worth it. I've never used a moby but I hear they are very hot and sometimes overwhelming with the amount of fabric that you have to work with."
babywearing,1rfwpd,canibuyatrowel,2,Mon Nov 25 21:27:40 2013 UTC,"Thank you for the info! I have read about the froggy leg position before and was a bit confused about it, it seems uncomfortable for baby? I have also read about rolling and stuffing a receiving blanket under the baby's bum so that they can fit better inside the carriers when they are small.   I think if I get a new one I am definitely leaning towards a ring sling, they seem most adaptable and comfy for both me and baby. The Ergo or Tula that you suggested, do you think they are husband friendly? He just doesn't feel comfortable strapping or tying things in, and wants something that he can wear on the back or front as he feels the need. He doesn't like the sling style either."
babywearing,1rfwpd,loveintheoven,2,Mon Nov 25 21:40:34 2013 UTC,"Definitely the ergo and Tula are daddy friendly :) the ergo comes in neutral colors such as black, gray, and a khaki color. Tulas have prints and the waist band goes bigger than the ergo. Froggy position is what's most comfortable for small babies. Basically you roll up a receiving blanket and they sit on it inside of the carrier like a little seat. Their legs don't spread wide enough to sit legs out. This might sound weird but with the ring sling you can just kinda ball them up in their comfortable position. You should check Facebook or meetup.com for a babywearing group in your area. They are usually loads of help (mine is) and you can see and feel all of these carriers before you buy them. They can give you hands on help if needed which is great. If you would like, you can pm me and I can help you try to find one :) or any other questions you may have, feel free to ask."

Both myself and my SO can wear the baby, it's suitable for front, back and hip carries as well as front facing (although it's debatable if that's ever recommended due to overstimulation). If you are on Facebook the group babywearing 102 is fantastic and busy and has tons of good info to help you choose a specific wrap for your new squish :)"
babywearing,1rdzh5,squiggywiggle,3,Mon Nov 25 02:33:09 2013 UTC,"Yup, another woven lover here! In fact, I have a Storch Leo too. Really supportive and didn't need any breaking in. I was all set to love my Moby wrap but the woven is so much more comfortable and easy to use and will last until toddlerhood."

After it warmed up, the Moby got to be too hot. Now I have a Babyhawk Mei Tai and it's really great. Easily adjustable, you can do back carries with it (although no carrying facing out), and I'm sure you could nurse in it, although I never have."

babywearing,1rdzh5,Flewtea,1 point,Mon Nov 25 19:28:16 2013 UTC,"No problem. I see there's lots of votes for wovens here too. I have never used one, but a friend of mine has several and loves them, so they're definitely worth checking out. I just like the ease-of-use with the mei tai. There's no learning curve there, but with wovens you have to learn the different wraps. Not a huge deal, just a preference. Good luck!"

It does everything you want and while it's a structured carrier, so it's not super thin (and don't get the sport versions, they just wear out sooner), it doesn't get any hotter than wearing a backpack. We've gone on two-hour hikes with her in summer and she didn't get overly sweaty or seem uncomfortable, though she was 7-8 months at the time."

The mei tai is easy and quick to tie, can work a variety of ways (front/back/hip), and has been my favorite since my cousin gifted it to us. It fits me at 5'4 and my husband at 6'3. Babe likes it too and will bring it to me now to be carried."
babywearing,1rd3z4,squigglybliss,1 point,Sun Nov 24 19:17:41 2013 UTC,"Mobys are pretty miserable when the weather gets hot and or humid. Since starting with a Moby Ive moved on to nearly exclusively using SSCs in all weather, so naturally I would suggest that....but what is your wearing pattern? Shopping? Walks? Quick in and out? Housework? Ring slings are great for quick in and out but I find lack support for longer carries. They are fairly breathable though. SSCs with a good waist belt (Boba, Beco, Ergo etc) arent ideal fir you to sit in(if thats important) but are great for walking and leave babys arms and legs out for cooler wearing. Boba has a meshy carrier with more breathable fabric but less support. I think Moby has an SSC these days as well."

They're not cheap, but the one I got can supposedly support up to 100 pounds in a back carry!  The fabric breathes really well, and they are the most adjustable of any option.  You can do front, hip, back, high back carries, etc. There are so many options, so even if the two of you did get swampy, you could just move him to a different area.  Plus, it's just nice to have the freedom to do different carries."

babywearing,1qmob2,wine_me_up,4,Thu Nov 14 18:15:39 2013 UTC,"I have a K'Tan and love it. I agree that the size might be wrong for you, possibly too big. You may need a smaller size. What size do you have? Also, it could be loose as the fabric can stretch. To tighten it back up, pop it in the washer and dryer and see if that helps. Good luck!"

babywearing,1qmob2,frogonmytoe,2,Thu Nov 14 21:44:15 2013 UTC,"The k'tan comes in sizes, so it may be too small for you. It may fit better when she's bigger, or maybe it will fit your husband better. It's great because it's not much fabric, but it's not very versatile, personally I'd recommend either a woven wrap or a ring sling, it's more money but you'll get a LOT more use out of it!"
babywearing,1qmob2,memmab,2,Thu Nov 14 19:18:18 2013 UTC,The k'tan runs large. It just seems like it might be too big. I had the exact same issue so I only used it when she got bigger but I never really loved it. I'm definitely more of a soft structured carrier kind of person.
babywearing,1qmob2,Sinafey,2,Thu Nov 14 19:35:48 2013 UTC,"It's definitely too big. It might be okay if you flip the crossbody rings as you would with a pouch carrier that's too big. Scroll all of the way to the bottom of this page to see: http://www.carrymeaway.com/pages/UsingaPouch.html  I'd also recommend trying a legs out carry with the Kangaroo position. It's hard to avoid putting weight on baby's feet/ankles while doing legs-in, and you really should try to avoid it. Legs out with a wide seat (fabric spread from knee to knee) is the ideal.   Je Porte Mon Bebe has awesome visuals showing ideal positioning: http://jeportemonbebe.com/en/faq/how-do-i-know-my-babys-legs-arent-forced-into-a-squat  Congratulations and good luck!"

I am not a small person, but I got a small (an extra small, maybe?) and I have the exact same problem you do.

babywearing,1qhgxp,Laurashrti,3,Tue Nov 12 21:28:14 2013 UTC,"Looks nice! Could you pretty please pass along how you made your wrap? I'm thinking about doing that for my baby (not due until May!), but I don't have a clue of where to start. What fabric did you use? How much sewing does it involve? And how much did it end up costing, if you don't mind the question?"
babywearing,1qhgxp,TardisNeedsLibrarian,3,Wed Nov 13 02:06:31 2013 UTC,"Sorry, I'm just now seeing this.   You'll want to purchase a sturdy fabric that isn't too stretchy. I used Osnaburg but you could also use table cloth material. (I bought Osnaburg from the Hobby Lobby website at $4.99/yard and used the always-available 40% off one item coupon. It really made a difference!) I bought 10 yards because I wanted extra for a shorty or ring sling.  First I washed the Osnaburg on hot and dried it on hot. Osnaburg shrinks quite a bit and it is important to let it shrink up before you measure and cut. Some suggest you wash and dry it two or three times but I only did once. I lost about half a yard.  Next, determine what wrap size you want your wrap to be. I wanted a 6 which is 4.6 meters (181+ inches). Again, Osnaburg shrinks, so I wanted to leave space for shrinkage and I also wanted to taper the ends. We measured 15 inches from each end so that not including the tapers the wrap measured 181 inches, then we cut on the diagonal so the tapers weren't too deep.   After the fabric was measured and cut I serged the edges. If you're not familiar, a serger uses 4 or more spools and has the capability to trim the edges to keep it even. At each end I tucked the four threads back into the serging with a needle and added some fraycheck. (*If you don't have a serger you could fold the edges under twice and then sew it for a nice seam. It would take a little more time to do that. You could also not sew or serge it at all if you don't mind slight fraying. The fraying won't effect the integrity of the wrap.)  I wanted a middle marker, so I took a piece of ribbon, folded it in half, then held it in place with pins until we got to that point of the fabric when serging. Needles can easily break with a serger, so we removed the needles and slowly serged over the ribbon to attach it.   Here are some pictures:  This is my mom measuring and cutting the tapered ends.  This is the serger.  This is what the serger looks like in action.  This is me serging one edge of the wrap.  This is a close up of the serged edges and middle marker.  This is a blurry pic of the finished and folded wrap.  I'm not a pro, but if you have questions let me know! It was a fun project."
babywearing,1qhgxp,TardisNeedsLibrarian,2,Wed Nov 13 14:40:03 2013 UTC,"Yay! You're the best! I think my aunt has a serger, so I might ask her to teach me to use it."

babywearing,1q92mp,pinkishyellow,1 point,Tue Nov 26 17:43:24 2013 UTC,"Sorry it's taken me so long to reply to this. We just recently moved, so things have been crazy!  I purchased 6 yards of Osnaburg. I washed on hot and dried it twice, because it will shrink. I cut it to a width of 32 inches, which I will be reducing to 30 soon because it's just a little too wide for me. I ironed, pinned, and hemmed the edges. I did not taper the ends on this one, but I will be adding tapers when I narrow it down. I made a shortie later that I tapered, and I really prefer the tapers. I just like the way it ties off, but it's purely personal preference.  After all of that, I purchased some Tulip dye for the grad dye. RIT is not safe to use, because if baby likes to chew, some of the dye can bleed out. Tulip and Dylon are usually available at most craft stores. You can also order Dharma online. I have not personally tried Dharma, yet, but I have heard amazing things! Just make sure it's a fiber reactive dye. I used the add more water method to do the grad dye. I'm really pleased with how it turned out.  I am very new to sewing and this was my first dye project, ever. I really wanted a woven wrap, but I just cannot bring myself to spend $$$ on something I can make myself. I spent approximately $30 total. I use it frequently for my 23 lbs 8 month baby and for my 31 lbs 2 year old.  Like I mentioned earlier, I made a shortie wrap using osnaburg again. I love it as well! My next project is to make a wrap from linen."
babywearing,1q1y4x,Butthole_Bread,5,Wed Nov 6 21:37:21 2013 UTC,"The Snugli is a narrow seat carrier.  They don't cause hip dysplasia, but they can exacerbate it (see here).  I have a Snugli in my arsenal, and honestly I don't like it much.  It doesn't have a waist strap, so all of the LO's weight is on your shoulders.  I find that exceedingly uncomfortable after a short amount of time OTOH, my husband uses ours sometimes, and has no issues with it.  If you want to wear on a regular basis and for extended amounts of time, the Ergo is nice.  Infantino makes an Ergo-like carrier called the Union.  I only used mine once, because it was too big for my LO at the time and before she got big enough I had gotten an Ergo, but I've heard it's a nice backup carrier.  For my backup I have an Infantino Sash mei tai.  It's comfortable, not difficult to use, and I really like it because I don't have to adjust it if I am handing the baby off to someone else.  Since it has ties rather than buckles I can just take it off and switch, without having to readjust it when I get it back.  Amazon has them for about $35 I believe."
babywearing,1q1y4x,5six7eight,7,Thu Nov 7 01:37:31 2013 UTC,"A Snugli is a ""crotch dangler""- it's not good for the baby's legs to be like that, it can cause hip displaysia. An Ergo is much more comfortable, is still very easy to use. You can also try a stretchy wrap like a Moby, or a ring sling. All easy to learn with and comfy for mom and baby!"
babywearing,1q1y4x,knitcaboodle,2,Wed Nov 6 23:15:46 2013 UTC,"Actually, current research shows they can't cause hip displaysia, but can make it worse in babies who already have it. They still aren't ideal for long periods of time."
babywearing,1q1y4x,msuaussiemom,3,Thu Nov 7 21:08:29 2013 UTC,You want a carrier that the seat goes from knee to knee. The narrow base ones can be very uncomfortable for baby and they my resist babywearing. They also tend to be more uncomfortable for you. I had a snugli and my son and I both hated it.
babywearing,1q1y4x,msuaussiemom,2,Wed Nov 6 23:07:30 2013 UTC,"The Snugli was my first carrier, but I quickly traded up to something better. It is not comfortable for the baby or for the wearer, and has very limited use. I would not recommend it.   A Moby wrap might be more in your price range for now than an Ergo, and would be good for a baby up to about 15 pounds or so. Once you get there, then get the Ergo (or similar). You can find them on Craigslist often for cheaper."
babywearing,1q1y4x,ADVentive,2,Thu Nov 7 17:29:08 2013 UTC,"You've gotten plenty of feedback now on the fact that Snuglis are not the best options for comfortable, happy wearing.

I had a Moby, my daughter HATED it.  Seriously, she disliked it so damn intensely she could just look at it and start wailing.  I think it's because she's so hot-natured; she's like a little furnace!  She DID like the Baby K'Tan, though.  There's a site that lets you rent carriers - it's a little pricey, but compared to buying a carrier you hate/LO hates/doesn't fit it's a pretty good deal."
babywearing,1q0473,LindyLove,3,Wed Nov 6 03:49:19 2013 UTC,"I do both baby wearing (maya wrap & baby bjorn) and have the big baby trend expedition travel system.  I also have a very nice umbrella stroller for the future (that was b/c my husband needed a smaller stroller to fit in his truck, then he decided to leave us).    We are in a suburban area so I drive to most places and then I have the choice of carrying or strollering at my destination.   It honestly depends on your lifestyle, and your body. While I love baby wearing, I have a lot of back issues and some days it's just not happening.  It's definitely not happening for a few hours at the mall or a big grocery trip.  Grocery isn't so bad b/c you have the option to put the infant seat carrier on the cart and by the time they are like 5 months old can strap them in the cart seat itself. Then again you said you live in an urban area- do you walk to the grocery store?  Imagine wearing the baby and carrying several bags of groceries home. Add a couple diapers, wipes, a pacifier, your keys, cell phone, and wallet to that mix.    I also frequent theme parks, outdoor events, and such several times a year- so a stroller with a big basket was a must.    There is really not 1 right answer.  Evaluate the costs too... sometimes a travel system makes sense b/c the package price is worth rather than have to go out and buy a separate stroller in a couple months.    Sorry if it wasn't much help, just a few more things to think about."

I don't miss it at all, but I am planning on buying a small umbrella stroller in the Spring when I start doing longer walks and trips to the park with my LO. He's 4 months old now and I wear him in either a wrap or an Ergo and he loves it. It's easier when I go shopping and if he is asleep in his car seat he usually goes right back to sleep in the carrier."

I would snap the car seat carrier into the stroller for those times. That's it. For your situation the travel system sounds completely unnecessary.  Buying a cheap umbrella stroller later on would probably work for you."

We never used a travel system and we rarely even took the infant seat out of the car.  I used the stroller regularly for a few months when I was pregnant with my second and my daughter was walking, but not walking a lot.  If she got tired and I was too sore to carry her, she'd be in the stroller.  I still used babywearing for shorter trips.  Personally, I hate using a stroller.  For me, they're awkward.  I've learned to streamline what I carry in our diaper bag.  For grocery trips where we're walking instead of driving, we have a rolling grocery cart so I don't have to sherpa the bags as well.  There are times where I feel like it would be nice to have somewhere to store stuff, but for the most part, I'm really happy to not use a stroller.  I couldn't believe how frustrating it was to try and find an elevator in some of my local malls....seriously, I was so used to just walking up the stairs I didn't know where they were and it was not obvious.  That said....if your baby arrives and you feel like you'd really like the stroller, there's nothing stopping you from getting one later."

Yes, we've used it a few times but that thing is HUGE and since we're in the city, we often just pop out with the Ergo. If I had to do it over and absolutely needed the stroller, I'd register for a smaller one or just get one off Craigslist."
babywearing,1pyx62,saratina,3,Tue Nov 5 19:29:04 2013 UTC,"The correct babywearing position is with his tummy faced to you, legs in the M-position (legs wide and knees higher than the bum) with the legs out and supported from knee to knee, head close enough to kiss, back arced into a C and the neck and back fully supported. Legs inside the carrier is not a preferred position since it puts pressure on the soles of the feet, which activates a reflex to 'stand up'. This reflex is very usefull when you are being born, but should otherwise be avoided since the hip sockets are not suited for the amount of pressure they get out of this. If the carrier is too wide to use with the legs out, you can try making this a bit smaller by putting a rubber band or little string just above the hip straps. The wrinkling that will occur is not ideal, but better than wearing legs in. An other problem mei tai's usually have when using them with newborns is that they don't offer the neck support tiny babies need. I don't have a solution for this, unfortunately, other than getting a woven or stretchy wrap or a carrier that can create head support."

I had a mei tai and used it some but I prefered the k'tan and now the Ergo to it. It definitely sounds like he's not quite in the correct position. Could be that the bottom end needs to be folded up to make it shorter and the tie should be fairly tight around his bum to support him. Legs outward and froggied."
babywearing,1pyx62,gridirongeek,3,Tue Nov 5 20:16:11 2013 UTC,"As a babywearing consultant it's my opinion almost all positions in the .pdf are not correct in a minor or major way (only the tummy to tummy ringsling photo is correct, although I can't see the legs). When using a mei tai the knot should never be on the back of the baby, since it puts pressure on the back which you don't want, especially not with tiny newborns. Other than that, legs should always be worn out of the carrier. Legs inside puts pressure on the soles of baby's feet, and baby's reaction is to stretch his legs. This puts too much pressure on the hips of the baby. If the carrier is too wide to get baby's legs out it is too big for the baby."
babywearing,1pyx62,VerityButterfly,2,Wed Nov 6 15:21:16 2013 UTC,"Bummer--but good to know. I don't think I can comfortably adjust it to allow him to be legs-out, so I'll probably just need to wait until he's bigger."

The way I handle this is to sell the least used carrier I have to go towards the purchase of my latest must have. I have an organic ergo too, also found on sale (woohoo) and I love it. I use it all the time and will continue to do so until she outgrows it and ill sell it to fund either a kinderpack or a Tula."

babywearing,1oyecl,Flewtea,4,Sun Oct 27 15:23:33 2013 UTC,"Well, I don't know how you divide up your finances, but in our marriage and at our income level, there is never a purchase over $10 that my husband doesn't know about. And how are you planning on hiding it from him and using it? So, I'd say check with him about buying it now. If they're an authorized retailer, they should have more, periodically at the very least, or maybe you could call any other branches in your location when you can afford it cleanly. You're not lacking for a way to carry baby but if you're anything like me, you'll always slightly regret not having the color you wanted. If your husband's ok with it, buy it without guilt! If not, Christmas is two months away..."

Kids in their bike seats, toddler behind me and baby on the front.

They usually have lending library's and meet ups where you can try different things.  I can't vouch for an unknown maker of meitai, except to say that if its triple stitched with corner reinforcements, and made with quality fabric that its probably safe. We actually love our infantino brand organic meitai, blooming vines design. It's about 30$ on amazon. We don't use the loops though. You can also stalk the Facebook swap, it's where parents from around the world can buy, sell, and trade carriers.

babywearing,1nv08i,sewsweet,2,Mon Oct 7 05:26:30 2013 UTC,He's 30 lbs now and we don't use the infantino anymore. Once he hit about 25 lbs it got hard to manage the long straps while tying him on back. I never felt like he was too heavy for it though. I opted for a boba 3G after that since the buckles are a lot easier to manage now.

Reason being is if, heaven forbid, something happened and the carrier broke resulting in injury to the baby then you want to know that they have the proper insurance to cover anything that happens. That being said, I have a DIY wrap that I made, and I was making a SSC as well before my sewing machine died lol, but I knew I was doing everything correctly and that adequate fabric was used, etc."

babywearing,1mqfmh,wcuhatter89,1 point,Thu Sep 19 20:41:03 2013 UTC,"This is a quite common problem with the Ergo carrier. It is a great carrier, but not for newborns. The infant insert is crap (professional opinion ;-) ) and the neck support insufficient for small babies. If you want to carry her in a SSC look into the Bondolino, Marsupi or Storchenwiege carrier. These are small enough for newborns to be used without any compromises (like an insert is) with the legs outside the carrier and have good options to give your baby head support.   As a babywearing consultant I would only recommend  the Ergo carrier for babies over 5 months old."
babywearing,1mqfmh,VerityButterfly,2,Fri Sep 20 08:02:01 2013 UTC,"Thank you! So I'm not crazy. I thought it just didn't seem right. I'll wait to use this one until she's a little older. In the meantime, my SIL just suggested Slinglings - have you heard of them? That's not a brand I've ever heard of while surfing around.  Also, I don't know what SSC is! I don't have any kind of preference.."
babywearing,1mqfmh,VerityButterfly,1 point,Fri Sep 20 13:57:01 2013 UTC,"SSC=Soft Structured Carrier, as opposed to a woven or stretchy wrap.  Slinglings are pouches, right? (as far as I can see on the website) Those are not suitable for newborns. The position recommended for newborns in pouches by the manufacturer (the 'comma position', lying horizontally) is not ergonomical and not save. Baby's chin can easily be forced on the chest, which can block the airway and thus suffocate the baby. And your baby is too young to be carried in the upright position in a pouch. Since it cannot be adjusted at any point there is no way you can create head support. Also, again because of the lack of adjustment there is a fair chance it won't be comfortable for you to wear. You would need the PERFECT size for you and your baby for it to be comfortable.  As mentioned before: suitable carriers are the Storchenwiege babycarrier, Marsupi plus or Bondolino (by Hoppediz). But it could be these are a lot more difficult to come by in the USA (if you live there) than in Europe (where I live). (I see PAXbaby does sell the Hoppediz woven wraps, so they should be able to preorder a Bondolino for you I think). And I keep forgetting, but the Emeibaby is a good option as well, but a bit more difficult to adjust quite right (it's a totally different system) and PAXbaby does sell those.  If you are not afraid of wraps, these are always the better option when it comes to perfect fit and ajustment. But since your original question was about a SSC I presumed you preferred one :)"
babywearing,1mqfmh,bnthrdntht,1 point,Fri Sep 20 14:24:50 2013 UTC,I used a ring sling from babyette on Etsy for my guy until he was 4 months old. Wraps can be cumbersome and intimidating at first if you don't have local groups or a friend that knows what they are doing. Also there is a ton of info online and not all are created equal.

For a little baby like ours (Bjorn is only good up to 25 lbs), his legs come out of it at a good angle that looks like the ""good"" picture on the International Hip Dysplasia site. . Baby Bjorn also has a response to this myth on their website (scroll down) with positive opinions from lots of child orthopedists. Also, there is a useful blog post here from a fellow who looked into this in more depth and couldn't find any evidence that Baby Bjorn would hurt hips, when used as directed. It seems the real danger is from swaddling tightly with the legs stretched out - which we don't do."

It's super comfy, very lightweight and light (it's hot today and wearing it is sooo much cooler than my ergo or moby), and bonus, my son loves it! He seems to like it more than any of our other carriers."

babywearing,1m81dd,Pawprint959,3,Thu Sep 12 03:03:23 2013 UTC,"Most people I have seen who are pregnant transition to doing back carries once the pressure on their belly gets uncomfortable. Woven wraps offer the most flexibility since you can tie with nothing touching your belly, or choose to go either above or below your belly, depending on what you find comfortable."
babywearing,1m81dd,kaceface,1 point,Thu Sep 12 03:38:31 2013 UTC,I would back carry but most of the time I don't have help with my little bug so that might be a little difficult. I have a k'tan and a soft structured carrier and a sling but no wrap =(

babywearing,1m81dd,chamcd,3,Thu Sep 12 04:52:58 2013 UTC,"I did back carries.  I used a SSC (Boba 2G) until the waist belt got too uncomfortable for me and then I switched to carriers that could be used without a waist belt, or were more flexible in where the belt hit.  My favourites were a Mexican rebozo or ring sling for short trips.  I'd get my daughter situated on my hip and then scoot her to the back.  It's a nice easy way to transition into back carries, since you are getting them positioned properly on the front and then just sliding them to the back.  I also liked using a woven wrap or narrow blanket podaegi for longer trips.  These allowed me to have a two shoulder, more supportive carry without the need for a waist belt.  I usually used tying methods that allowed for Tibetan finish so it was all off my belly.  A Mei Tai is an option too, if you tie the waist belt low on the hips or above the belly.  If you, or someone you know, sews, you can make your own woven wrap out of cheap fabric like 100% cotton gauze or Osnaburg/Osnabruck.  I've seen both as low as $3-5/yd, so you could have a wrap for less than $30.  A narrow blanket podaegi is a pretty simple project, too.  You just need about 5yds of a strong, bottom-weight fabric.  Cotton twill weave is one of my preferred strong, but cheap options.  The ""blanket"" portion is not actually supporting the weight of the baby/child, so it can be anything you like the look of.  You make one long strap and sew the ""blanket"" in the middle of it."

I tried that and the ergo in the store but I found the soleil to be way more comfortable for me and baby. If you have some wear to try them out first, that would be good because how you are built makes a difference on the comfort. Im 5'10"" and 145 lbs and that made a difference to me because I found the ergo back to be too short for my frame. Unfortunately it's in the same price range as the ergo.

My daughter was around 19 lbs and my son was around 23 lbs both over 30 inches tall, so they fit great. I have really bad back pain due to arthritis, so it can be difficult to wear or even just carry one of my kids for too long. But I found that the support this carrier gives me really makes it fun again! Now that my daughter has entered the stage of not sitting in the shopping cart seat my 3G is getting used a lot and I love it."

babywearing,1lps2l,BonBonLonglegs,2,Wed Sep 4 14:23:57 2013 UTC,"Update: after trying them out, I purchased the Beco Soleil (B) over the Ergo (E) for the following reasons: The clip on the waist band for B is in the middle of the back. E's buckle is on the side and digs into my hip. The back of B is very tall. E's back left both my daughters arms always above. My daughter can still pull one arm above on B or have them both tucked in which is good for napping.  Straps can cross over on the back of B but not E. I find that weight is distributed better that way.  B doesn't come with a hood like E, however the top is padded and LO always napped in a mei tai without a hood so for us it is not a necessity. A hood can be purchased separately for B, but I don't see myself buying one.  B has a nice canvas material, although I really liked how soft the material was on the organic E.  And the shallow reason, I like the pattern (Micah)"

Definitely took a little getting used to, and was harder when she was tiny (7 mo now) b/c I was so afraid of hurting her. This is a PDF of the instructions mine came with http://www.mayawrap.com/MayaWrapBabySlingInstructionsLowRes.pdf  Every once in a while I take it apart and re-thread it b/c I've twisted things by throwing it all over the place. I put the 2 edges together, do the back n forth zig zag with every inch or so of the fabric, then pull that through the 2 rings and then through the 1.  The first time you should have another person help hold the baby in the carrier while you get it adjusted.  To adjust i pull one end of the fabric coming through the rings to the right and the other to the left until the sling is tight enough around the baby & I.  To get her out I just pull up the 1 ring and the fabric slides out a bit.  Then all I need to do to get her back in next time is the left right pull to tighten it.  I get her in and out in seconds.  In 7 months I think I have only taken mine apart 2-3 times to re-situate everything.    I could probably try to skpe or something sometime to show you if that would help :-)"

That seems pretty time consuming, but doing just then end just tangles me up again. And I've done it backwards twice, lol. Once I finally got it threaded, I did seem to have better luck with it, but now I think my problem is I'm not getting it on tight enough before I put baby in.

There are also many mamas that are willing to do payment plans with you. Do you have a specific wrap in mind?

I also find the hip swing hard. I put my girl on my shoulders and then shimmy her down.  The video I'm attaching is for a high back carry and has the shoulder shimmy. I'm not a huge fan of the high back carry because I'm on the bustier side but I tie below the bust and that works well and the shoulder straps get tied above.  This is why I like the mei tai because its so customizable for tying off.  http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=59oTw0NyTbY&amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D59oTw0NyTbY sorry it's mobile, I'm on my phone"

The other reason I like it, is that I don't have to worry about holding her on and then flinging the mei tai over. In the beginning it was a slow process for us in comparison to the video, probably about 5 minutes. I still like to do it in front of a mirror or with some one else.  Good luck!"
babywearing,1khopp,kaceface,2,Fri Aug 23 01:20:31 2013 UTC,"My favorite back carry is Christina's Ruckless (I hate ruck straps). I started doing back carries/superman toss around 5 months, but you can do them earlier.   My other favorite is a torso carry. The first video shows you how to do a strapless ""double hammock"" carry. When I do it this way, I prefer not to tie a knot at the top. Instead, I just fold all three layers of fabric over one another (like in the third torso video below).  The second video shows a faster way to do a torso carry with a long wrap. This is the way I normally do it, but I don't do the fancy twisting chest part like she does. I just cross each end of fabric across my chest and fold it down at the end (like this)  If you end up liking torso carries, I would suggest buying a kanga (the small piece of fabric that is used in the last video). It's so easy for on the go!  Another really popular back carry is the Double Hammock."

For mei tai and ergo back carries I generally do the hip scoot manoeuvre. What are you trying at the moment?  I'm not great a wrapping. My son screams blue murder if I try and superman him. It is a good way to get them nice and high up for wrapping tho. I think generally people start with a ruck."

babywearing,1k8ken,thesnowfox,1 point,Tue Aug 13 01:23:16 2013 UTC,"I loved my mei tai wrap for most of my daughters first year, but when she got to about 18 lbs it started to hurt to wear. I actually had the Infantino Sash Mei Tai to start with because I was new to baby wearing and it was affordable. She should also be worn with her legs tucked up until her hips open around 3 or 4 months, so make sure you're using the correct holds (and no back carrying until she can hold her head up for however long you want to wear her). I really had no complaints about it, except that it's a little small for when they get bigger, but it's a good starting point. Also, you never wear a baby facing out from you, it's really bad for their developing spines.  Source: http://www.bobafamily.com/blog/2011/10/11/nine-reasons-not-to-carry-your-baby-facing-out/  Edited to add: Now that she's gotten to heavy to wear in my mei tai we graduated to a Boba 3G SSC (soft structure carrier). And we love it! She fits so perfectly in it. Granted it's more aimed for toddlers not newborns or small infants. Something to remember when she gets bigger. We found 2 Boba 3G's on sale because they were returns and saved about $40 on each, my husband loves wearing my son now, and better yet, my son loves being worn finally."
babywearing,1k8ken,PreposterousMurmur,1 point,Tue Aug 13 00:03:07 2013 UTC,"Thanks, I've never heard that about forward facing carries.  I know that I can't do a back carry now, but it is generally my preference to get something that will grow with us.  I went back and really read the reviews on the Ecosash, and now I'm back onto the Sash.  How do you put her in with legs tucked up in a Mei Tai?  Do they come with instructions for that or should I be looking for youtube videos before I purchase?"
babywearing,1k8ken,BonBonLonglegs,2,Tue Aug 13 00:30:25 2013 UTC,Just wanted to say you can actually do a high back carry with a fairly small baby in a mei tai. I didn't do a back carry until older but you could try it for sure. Also I love my mei tais (not the infantino). I carry my 18 lbs-ish 8 month old a lot in it and doesn't provide shoulder strain and distributes the weight fairly well.
babywearing,1k8ken,VerityButterfly,2,Tue Aug 13 03:18:20 2013 UTC,"You shouldn't. Putting the feet insinde the mei tai (or any carrier or wrap for that matter) will trigger the reflex to stand up (babies have this reflex to stand up when they feel pressure against the soles of their feet to help them get out of the uterus), and this puts too much pressure on the soft, developing hip sockets.  Don't force her legs open into a position she doesn't make herself, but try to wear legs out as soon as possible, preferably from birth on.  Also, while a mei tai is a good ergonomical baby carrier, most aren't suitable for a baby so young as yours. They don't offer the head, neck and high-back support a young baby needs. Around 5 months, most babies are strong enough in their neck and upper back to be carried in a mei tai.  I don't know if your country has a retailer for the Storchenwiege carrier or Marsupi plus carrier, but these are very well designed for very small babies. The size of the back panel is small enough (or can be made small enough) to be able to wear them legs out and they can be adjusted for the head support (by rolling up the hood and fastening it tightly). With small babies, to keep them at the right position on your belly, they need to be 'close enough to kiss' aka you need to be able to kiss their head without leaning forward. This means the hip band goes more around your waist or even chest, but if you are wearing them correctly (tight enough mostly) this is much more comfortable then wearing them very low with the hip/waist band on your hips."
babywearing,1k8ken,PreposterousMurmur,1 point,Thu Aug 15 15:36:34 2013 UTC,I think the sash did come with instructions on the newborn hold. I describe it as frog legged because their legs tuck up next to their tummies. My daughter stayed like that for 4 months or more before riding with her legs out.

babywearing,1k6plb,techno-logical,4,Mon Aug 12 04:03:02 2013 UTC,"If by traditional you mean the babybjorn kind of carriers, then yes this is better. But a proper SSC is better than this. This carrier doesn't fully support the legs from knee to knee, the knees are lower than the bum (knees need to be at least as high as the bum) and the back of the kid is not properly supported because the stiff seat makes it impossible for the fabric to be thight around the lower back."

I wanted to know if anyone's baby has had difficulty in the hipseat carriers. Edit: I tried it on at the store, and it definitely felt like the baby's weight would be supported well on his/her bottom. I am worried that a traditional carrier would have some of the baby's weight supported where the limbs hang out."
babywearing,1k6plb,thesnowfox,3,Mon Aug 12 04:03:55 2013 UTC,"A carrier such as an Ergo (known as a SSC - soft structured carrier) offers good support because the baby's bottom and legs are supported from knee to knee. Yes, there is a bit of weight placed on the upper legs. However, as I'm sitting in my office chair, I have support from knee to knee - much more comfortable than if I just had my bottom on the edge of the chair.

babywearing,1k5n6f,SDladythrowaway,3,Sun Aug 11 18:39:44 2013 UTC,"Hip carries can be done from birth on, with the legs out of the wrap (legs and feet in can cause the baby to stand up in the wrap due to the pressure on the soles of their feet. While useful in helping you getting him out of the womb this puts too much pressure on the hip sockets).  The curve of your hip is exactly the right angle for your babies hips to be in. If you worry about the head support (although I don't see the difference in head support between wearing on your tummy or on your hip with a ringsling) you can use (part of) the tail and tuck it in the upper rail of the ringsling.  Example: http://www.draagjeliefste.nl/uploads/2/0/4/1/20417557/9310814_orig.jpg?145 (this is with a woven wrap, baby bib and my tiiiiny second daughter, but the idea is the same)"

Some people do skype consultations but unlike a meeting those usually cost a little money.  http://www.babywearingsandiego.org/  Hip carries didn't work very well for us until my baby was about 7 months old but if yours has good head control there is nothing unsafe about a hip carry, it is just about comfort."

Does baby have good head control? I think that would be the only concern. When I wear my daughter in the ring sling I tighten almost as much as I need to before I put baby in then just minimal adjusting once baby is in. That also helps to keep your rings up high and not on your chest. One thing I've learned is to start the rings very high, if not over your shoulder so that when you tighten they end up in proper position.

babywearing,1k3bx8,Mombeth,2,Sat Aug 10 15:34:51 2013 UTC,"This is a good page detailing different lengths, what they can be used for and why you might choose one over another.  I love short wraps now, but when I started I preferred my size 6/4.6m.  I still love my 4.6m, but I can easily get away with a 4.2m (I just like the versatility and don't mind the extra tails hanging).  If you get fabric that's at least 140cm/60"" wide, you can make at least 2 wraps.  Most wraps are 70-80cm/27-31"" wide.    If you got enough fabric to make a 5.2m/6yd wrap (so as was mentioned before, add on 1 yard for shrinkage if you're getting something like Osnaburg), then you could have one 5.2m/6yd (or 4.6m/5yd) x 70cm/30"" wrap and you could cut the other half of the fabric into a 3.1m/3.4yd wrap and a 2.1m/2.3yd ring sling (slingrings.com is a trusted source of ring sling rings).  So, assuming you get your Osnaburg at about $5/m or $5/yd, you can have a long wrap, a shorty and a ring sling for about $30 + the cost of rings (and dye if you want to get colourful).  Standard woven wrap sizing chart from PAXbaby.  size 2 -  2.7 meters = 8.86 feet = 102.36 inches  size 3 -  3.1 meters = 10.17 feet = 122.05 inches  size 4 -  3.6 meters = 11.81 feet  = 141.73 inches  size 5 -  4.2 meters = 13.78 feet = 165 inches  size 6 -  4.6 meters = 15.09 feet = 181.10 inches  size 7 -  5.2 meters = 17.06 feet = 204.72 inches  size 8 – 5.60 meters = 18.37 feet = 220.47 inches"

I like cotton apparel fabrics best. You'll know when he gets too heavy by the fabric stretching and warping, it won't just rip and fail all at once (scary!)  For a big kid linen works nice. You want something with a somewhat rough texture (not like a bed sheet) so that your knots don't slip and the fabric has friction against itself. Before buying fabric try tying it in a knot to see how bulky it will be."

babywearing,1k3bx8,Carlie_Queue,1 point,Sun Aug 11 03:16:20 2013 UTC,"Avoid: tight weaves like quilting cotton, and jersey. The latter because of the size of your mini, though the stretchy wraps like Moby can be easily DIYed with jersey (and no sewing since it rolls and doesn't fray).  Okay: gauze or linen/rayon blends. Gauze, if not very carefully wrapped, can dig and doesn't give as much stretch. Linen blended with anything other than cotton loses it's breath-ability IMO.  Good: osnaburg (found with the utility fabrics in most stores) or linen.  A reliable way to tell if the weave will be loose enough to make an awesome wrap is to hold it up to light. Can you see through it somewhat? Great! No? Probably too thick.  Still not sure? Pull at it 3 ways- across the width, along the length, and diagonally. Diagonal stretch is wonderful...the other two not so much as it won't be as secure (especially as baby grows).  Edit: gauze digs and doesn't give as much support, not stretch. Because phone typing is hard. :/"
babywearing,1k3bx8,Carlie_Queue,2,Sun Aug 11 02:58:33 2013 UTC,since I've heard osnaburg is good from multiple sources I think I'll go with that. But I don't know.much about buying fabric.

babywearing,1k3bx8,Carlie_Queue,1 point,Sun Aug 11 03:05:52 2013 UTC,"I should also have mentioned that osnaburg shrinks A LOT. For a size 6 wrap, you need 4.6 meters finished product. I would get 6 yards of material and wash before hemming."

babywearing,1k3bx8,VerityButterfly,2,Sun Aug 11 03:26:10 2013 UTC,I would definitely not use something that's already quilted/filled with polyester. You want just the fabric itself for a wrap. You're headed in the right direction!
babywearing,1k1zx1,Mombeth,6,Fri Aug 9 22:20:14 2013 UTC,"Well, if you say that an average wrap is about $100 and 5 yards, that's $20 a yard. For high-quality woven fabric not made in Indonesia somewhere, that's really not terribly expensive!"
babywearing,1k1zx1,Flewtea,6,Fri Aug 9 22:59:07 2013 UTC,"When I first got into woven wraps I wondered the same thing. Yes, many are cotton, some are a blend (cotton/hemp, linen, etc..). But they are woven to a very high standard. They are safety and weight tested to well above a child's weight. They also retain their value very, very well. They can be resold for, most times, exactly what you paid. In my opinion, they are well worth it just for the fact that it can be resold, and on top of that they are the most versatile and comfortable carriers. Hope that helps :) Edit: there are also limited edition and highly sought after wraps which will be ridiculously priced well above retail price. Those are a different story lol."
babywearing,1k1zx1,that_girl13,6,Sat Aug 10 00:00:11 2013 UTC,"Some wraps are handwoven and many of those are fair trade.  So a fair amount of the money is actually going to the person weaving the fabric (which is ridiculously time consuming...there is a great step-by-step on thebabywearer.com where someone posted pictures of the process on her own loom; IIRC it took almost a week and two people just to set up the warp threads).  My Girasol wrap was handwoven in Guatemala with traditional methods.  I really loved that the villagers who had learned these weaving methods passed down from generation to generation were actually benefiting from their skill.  However, I couldn't afford to pay full retail for the design I loved, so I found a previously loved one for almost half what it would have cost me to buy it brand new.  There are a lot of great wraps available on FSOT (for sale or trade) boards.  Thebabywearer.com and diaperswappers.com are two big ones, but there are lots of Facebook groups and sites around the world.  Machine woven wraps are less expensive and cotton will be cheaper than, say a silk wrap.  There are also a lot of great DIY options.  If you can hem a length of fabric, then you can use any bottomweight you like and look for a fabric sale online or at your local store.  Linen, cotton twill (not quilter's cotton), Osnaburg/Osnabruck (really stiff at first but apparently awesome once broken in), cotton gauze.  Just cut to the length you want and finish the edges.  Bonus: if you want a 4.6m wrap and you buy fabric that's 144cm wide, you can cut it down the centre lengthwise and have 2 wraps.  Dye one or give as a gift, or have a spare in case one is dirty.  No-sew options are the same as long as you buy fabric that doesn't fray.  My favourite short wraps right now are my African Kangas; they are just strongly woven cotton fabric (Dutch Wax Print if you're searching the interwebs).  Buying second hand is a fabulous way to get a high quality carrier for less than retail.  I've also lucked into a couple 50% off during sales like Black Friday.  You can make a carrier out of a bed sheet, it really doesn't have to be expensive.  Some people collect wraps and carriers the way others collect designer handbags...nothing wrong with that, but certainly not the only way to go."

babywearing,1jylal,CREAMY_CHICKEN,2,Thu Aug 8 15:33:17 2013 UTC,It looks like its too big as your baby is really low. It could be the wrong size. I had a pocket sling with my first baby and wasn't a huge fan because it wasn't adjustable.  Nursing in any sling or carrier had a huge learning curve and requires lots if practice in my opinion. How old is your babe? baby might be more comfortable being carried in a different style and then adjusting when its nursing time.  YouTube is always a good source for learning how to nurse in a carrier and using one too.
babywearing,1jylal,BonBonLonglegs,1 point,Thu Aug 8 15:46:23 2013 UTC,"Ah that maybe the case! Darn and it was a gift too :( I also have an ergo but thought this would be fun since we're all going camping next week. She is 20 weeks and is around 15 pounds. I figured something was off especially after seeing any pictures. Unfortunately, I don't believe it's adjustable. The website didn't even have a tutorial, I had to look it up on YouTube.  Thank you  Also, what are the disadvantages of it being too low, or too big? I've been using it for a couple days now and she really likes it. She doesn't really get too fussy unless I sit down without nursing. Am I doing any harm by continuing to use it? I also have a 16 month old so this has been a life saver!"
babywearing,1jylal,VerityButterfly,1 point,Thu Aug 8 15:52:38 2013 UTC,"The biggest disadvantage at this age is your comfort. A higher, thighter carrier is more comfortable for your back. If you are a bit comfortable with a sewing machine you can hem it a bit shorter at the shoulder hem. The right length is when put on the lowest point is on top of your hipbone or slightly higher if you like it a bit higher. You can also measure the distance from shoulder to opposing hipbone (or waist) and double this, this would be the length your carrier needs to be.  Also, try to wear legs out, sitting on your hip as soon as possible (might be somewhat of a problem because the upper rail can't be tightened like a ring sling would). The way your baby has her legs in the carrier are suboptimal for the hip development. Spreading them around your hips is a better position.  (Also, a bigger concern would be this lying down position when done with a newborn. They can die if their heads are bent down on their chest because they cannot breathe anymore. But since your daughter is not a newborn anymore this won't be an issue. Wanted to mention if you ever have a third child :) )  Oh, and I don't nurse and wear. If baby is in a correct wearing position her head is on my chest, so no way she can reach my (although flexible :P ) breast."
babywearing,1jylal,Lilpeapod,1 point,Thu Aug 15 15:53:02 2013 UTC,Ring slings are wonderful for nursing and wearing. Since they aren't meant to stay in that position it's ok for short carries. We would never of had food in the house this summer if I weren't able to..lol
babywearing,1jzeij,bl4ckbird,1 point,Thu Aug 8 21:20:31 2013 UTC,You might be able to find a Butterfly II in robots. Watch out with ebay and make sure you buy from an authorized retailer to avoid Chinese knockoffs. I found my B2 robots by going through the list of authorized retailers on the Beco website.
babywearing,1jzeij,atemporalsquid,1 point,Fri Aug 9 00:56:56 2013 UTC,What are the main differences between the two models? I had found a comparison site but now I have no idea what I read..
babywearing,1jzeij,atemporalsquid,1 point,Fri Aug 9 01:01:17 2013 UTC,The main difference is the internal panel that holds baby in so you can kind of put baby on like a backpack. The downside of that panel is tfhat it gets in the way of your boobs if you want to breastfeed in the carrier.  http://paxbaby.com/beco-baby-carriers-gemini-vs-butterfly-ii/    That is a good breakdown of the differences otherwise.
babywearing,1jzeij,I3km,1 point,Fri Aug 9 01:08:47 2013 UTC,"Thanks for getting back to me. I've never actually experienced baby wearing, so in your opinion how difficult is it really to get a back carry position in the gemini (or similar models) because the extra panel in the BB2 looks like it may be uncomfortable to me. If I can't find robots, I may move on to another print - I'm just really into the Gemini haha."
babywearing,1jzeij,atemporalsquid,1 point,Fri Aug 9 04:04:55 2013 UTC,"I have a butterfly 2 and it is rad for back carries. Like putting on a backpack sortof. I have another ssc similar to the gemini and back carries are still possible but for older kids, and with a more difficult learning curve. With my butterfly I was back wearing my kid from full head control. With my other carrier I had to wait until maybe 9+ months. I do miss being able to easily bf in my butterfly carrier though I bought it so I could have baby on my back and my front/arms free for my toddler.  As a beginner I would say just go with the gemini. The butterfly is a bit too adjustable and can be a little overwhelming as a result."
