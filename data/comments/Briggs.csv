Jokes aside though, losing in this game is subjective, even if you got kicked out of your point hold you were still a pop sink for the enemy faction and eased fights on other fronts.    Keeping moral up for the squad is about having positive comms and accomplishing goals.    If someone is being loudly negative, it affects everyone listening, focusing on your deaths, overall losses, enemy cheese etc keep it to yourself. You might need some more general shit talking.     Squad goal setting affects moral too. When failing, you either need to set easier goals, or lower the negativity from failing. Focusing on a too large a goal can feel futile for a squad, don't focus on winning the alert or saving an amp station, just get the gens up and let the force commander/platoon leader organise larger scale operations."
Briggs,3e2e56,Flauz,2,Tue Jul 21 14:28:06 2015 UTC,"There's always a positive in every loss. You got platoon bombed? That's a platoon's worth of people that aren't defending other important territories. You got max crashed? That's a fuckton of resources they no longer have access to. You got wrecked by an elite outfit's squad? That's a very powerful force that isn't fighting elsewhere.   Even if nothing goes right, the positive is that you can learn better for next time. Maybe you can fit a battlebus or harasser on a point or covering a chokepoint. Maybe you got sniped by an oddly placed infiltrator, but now you know of a good spot for the future. Maybe you've learned how you can better balance your squad compositions.   There's always something positive to be taken away from every single cap/attack/loss, regardless of the outcome.   Also, a few jokes and TS banter helps too. Don't make shit too serious, or people will burn out. Make your objectives clear, but don't be a nazi."
Briggs,3e2e56,Ridiculisk1,3,Tue Jul 21 15:21:10 2015 UTC,"Generally squad morale is about the tempo of the fights: mix up the fast, intense point holds with some longer periods in larger fights, that give your squad members some time to find their footing without frequent redeploys. Mix up infantry play with a bit of vehicle combat, change your deploy points from static sundy spawns to air drops. The trick is mixing up the variety without making it feel like they're changing so fast that they can't get a good foothold in the fights they're engaging with."
Briggs,3e2e56,NotFrenchArtaud,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:52:26 2015 UTC,"I think there are many ways to keep moral high and it always depend on the squad. I thread a Outfit Squad different than a public Squad, but overall I would say:  Just don't give them the time to be demotivated and predict a potential defeat before it happen. An Example:  ""We will likely lose this base, but we will hold them back and delay them as long as we can.""  30 Secs before the base is lost:  ""Let’s redeploy out to the next base and lets prepare our defense""  If the leader keeps pushing, the Squad will follow."
Briggs,3e2e56,PeRXeRs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:55:36 2015 UTC,"Generally if you are winning fights then I find that morale maintain's itself but if you are continually losing and morale starts to get low a few things I like to do personally is go back to the warp gate, take a quick break if you want, regather and then grab some gals and hit a base that may not have much of a fight going at that point in time, just to give the squad a break for a bit and then slowly work up to harder and bigger tasks.

Briggs,3e0m5g,kurosan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:27:55 2015 UTC,"I think that if anything VS were too clustered around the NC front, getting farmed, whilst the people defending against the small TR and NC squads nibbling territory were there ones spread thinly due to a lack of support. I know that might squad were jumping all over the place because of it, and whilst we had a plan to at least start fires on the TR front to stop them pushing us as much as we could we couldn't manage it as we had to put out fires all over the place.  Defending against the NC hammer is wise, attacking them when they can drop it hard is not.  To win the alert, VS should have stopped attacking the NC in the second half of the alert, especially the last thirty minutes of it, and defended against the small squads of TR and NC pushes that were eating away our territory.   Instead, the majority of VS were getting farmed. Even my squad got in on it as by the last twenty minutes of the alert we gave up on trying to defend things, but after ten minutes or so it was pretty shit and so we just called it a day."

Like i always hear squaddies in TS saying 'ohh the farm' but never an actual plan to get a farm setup.  Ive been playing on-and-off on my NC toon for the past month and in my first R18 platoon, we locked down a garage at Watersons Redemption and i heard about 4 dudes saying 'DONT KILL THE SUNDY, JUST FARM THEM'. I racked up around 30 kills on a Sundy gun lol.  TL;DR = NC like to farm"
Briggs,3e0m5g,Suthix,-2,Tue Jul 21 05:04:02 2015 UTC,"Haha sounds like one of my platoons.   It's good discipline, if we have 'defeated' the enemy commander, but he and his team don't know it yet, and there are no bases crying out for assistance, it's a sadistic way to lower enemy moral, undermine the opposing commanders ability infront of his team and for our guns to feed."

I'm assuming they're forfeiting this saturdays match and just doing a friendly since we were up against IB only, ZETA rage quit after their loss. FCLM and SW2G knew they weren't able to get the numbers required and so asked all the people at the pre season meeting if anyone had a problem with them merging, if IB or ZETA knew they didn't have the numbers its not like they weren't given the opportunity.   On a sidenote why are there bases outside of the roster we agreed to? At the meeting we all agreed on farmers maps. AU and NA for reference. Not complaining, just wondering."

Briggs,3dxnc8,Yellohanz,9,Mon Jul 20 11:28:38 2015 UTC,"*note:- this is a pub commanders perspective... i would expect outfits running ops to be wildly different.  My golden rule has always been :- ""hold what you have, push when you can""  Generally, I like to establish the command momentum and build cohesion at the beginning of a platoon, while the numbers are low and our effectiveness is limited (during the recruit phase)    During the recruit phase i like to stick to defense in order to weed out the players that aren't listening and assess what i can reasonably expect from the numbers i have on hand.  Once i've weeded out the ppl not on comms it's on to probing the response generated by attacking a faction or key location. (assessment phase)  Then, i adopt a predominantly defensive posture unless VS are not losing any hexes. If there is a lull, i'll push out depending on the numbers / effectiveness of what i have on hand... i've already established whos on comms and what we are capable of.  IMO:- there's zero risk for failing an attack as long as the golden rule is followed... essentially if VS is losing a lot of territory i know I'm NOT that commander that is overextending our lines (because i'm always following the golden rule) and that it's better to just defend (to the best of that platoons/squads ability) until other commanders pay more attention to the map... Im just the pub herder so i can't really be expected to carry the faction with 24 or so BR 18's.   So those are the ins and outs of my preferences for defence / attack from my perspective."

Briggs,3dxnc8,-unbless-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:13:50 2015 UTC,"yeah, overall i have to defend.  If i had my way and could log into a platoon of br100 players with an average of 1.5 or more KD... THEN id happily push all day.  But until i've got all my people to that stage im gonna be defending as primary."
Briggs,3dxnc8,XCVJoRDANXCV,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:00:54 2015 UTC,"holy shit unbless, positive karma 0_o what is this black magic?!?!"
Briggs,3dxnc8,immaNeenja,4,Mon Jul 20 23:47:35 2015 UTC,"you farm as an individual in a defense, you attack as an organised whole as an outfit, and you rejoice as a server when R18/0my/ice decides to attack a base that can't be cheesed"
Briggs,3dxnc8,ChillyPhilly27,2,Mon Jul 20 13:12:29 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, solo players don't have the time or inclination to go to all the effort of setting up and maintaining spawns, which are crucial to any attack. Organised squads are more inclined to attack than defend because of dick waving rights over bases, and time spent per player on non-man killing duties is minimised because it's spread out over 6-12 people. It's much easier to move one person around via redeployment than several. Therefore, you're far more likely to see organised groups attacking, and solo players defending because of the advantages and disadvantages of both activities  Personally, I rarely go to all the effort of pulling a transport and going to an empty base unless I've got at least 3 FCLM guys who are both able and willing to back me up. Redeploy defending and piggybacking off the work of other players is so much easier and gets higher KPH"
Briggs,3dxnc8,TheFullCologne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:45:18 2015 UTC,"not so much interested in solo (just because people can do anything when they are playing by themselves), although you make good points about setting up spawns"
Briggs,3dxnc8,RipperTR,4,Tue Jul 21 10:59:26 2015 UTC,"Attacking bases is more fun imo. It's just an amazing feeling being able to capture a base and holding out in a room against 2-3 times your numbers because it feels like you are doing something right, attracting all the pop to you.  Defending and being able to push from spawn right through the point and clear the enemy when underpopped is also fun, but i think it happens more when attacking.."
Briggs,3dxnc8,NSGDX1,3,Mon Jul 20 11:43:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed, there's nothing quite like watching the last few seconds on the clock whilst facing overwhelming pop. Even if they retake the base it's still considered a win.  Defense is for farming stats when going solo."
Briggs,3dxnc8,XCVJoRDANXCV,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:51:43 2015 UTC,I make a distinction between farming and defending. You can do both but it's quite possible that when you are defending you may not actually get to farm
Briggs,3dxnc8,RichiesGhost,4,Tue Jul 21 11:01:57 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure JUGA/RSNC does more attacks(on bases) than any other outfit on Briggs and they're obviously more organized than any other outfit.  Reason why most defend that attack is because it's easier to do it.   You have a permanent spawn which can't be killed like AMS. You simply click on REINFORCEMENTS NEEDED when deploying on mini-map, this can't be done for attacking.   Normally Instant Action should take you offensive side of battle when you can attack, rather it spawns on the closest sundy to that base(if you don't get to a different continent/base) or right above the spawn room of the base you'll be defending. Pretty useless imo."
Briggs,3dxnc8,Ridiculisk1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:14:11 2015 UTC,does anyone have the stats at the outfit level? or is that a gut fell?
Briggs,3dxnc8,crushdepth5thFaction,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:03:16 2015 UTC,"we do different things based on our numbers at the time. If were: Tiny (<4) We kill spawns and farm small(4-6), defensive play respectably sized (6-12) attacking bases.   we Never have more than 12 guys.  I generally try to support other outfits so NC leaders chat's revent revival has made my life easier."
Briggs,3dxnc8,DemonJnr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:54:07 2015 UTC,"GunR is a defensive outfit during alerts. We are usually among the first to get to a base in need of a defense, and when we go on the offensive it's usually to secure lanes.   We just spent this alert getting trashed because of it."
Briggs,3dxnc8,Vaelkyri,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:03:38 2015 UTC,"Attacking is more fun, defending is easier due to permanent spawns.   Random pubbies probably won't have the organisation or ability to successfully attack a base, especially if it's defended by an organised outfit.   I have more defenses, because I prefer that playstyle. I've noticed the larger outfits attack a lot, because they can throw their numbers behind the attack, but small outfits tend to be more effective if they are better organised and entrenched."
Briggs,3dxnc8,pedrotski,2,Mon Jul 20 12:07:11 2015 UTC,"I have more defenses because they are easier to get to, ie. I am lazy."
Briggs,3dxnc8,pedrotski,2,Mon Jul 20 14:35:13 2015 UTC,"Not only that, you can rack up multiple base defences in a single defence if there's a bit of point control back and forth between attackers and defenders.  Whereas attackers only get a base attack counting when the base gets captured.  Pretty sure any player with more attacks than defences is living in some very rarified air."

Proof is in the pudding, and Unbless has kept TROL running for a year or so and now is launching a new Outfit, much to my dissapointment, on VS.

Briggs,3dvzr2,deadmanken,5,Tue Jul 21 02:51:01 2015 UTC,"Assuming you're genuinely asking, I believe it's because everything he does is in mass. If he's in a Galaxy, it's got to be 4 Galaxies. If he's going to be pulling a Sundy to attack a base, it's going to be a platoon of Sundies. It's rare to see him in the open without a horde of people close by. While it is reassuring and makes a huge difference in VS alerts, it is an utter shitfest to fight against if you're NC or TR. It kills fights and can be difficult to counter which a lot of people don't have to means to do, though NC have recently been countering large VS platoons in excellent fashion.   It's like TROL zergs but happens far more often.      I guess the ""unbless is a shitlord"" reaction is just because of the cheese. The people in his platoon tend to love the organised activities and I've had some fun with them but fun will oft be a the expense of others which is where the butt-hurt comes from.      I like Unbless and have a lot of respect for the effort he puts into public platoons but can completely understand the reactions from the community when you're at a good fight and suddenly you have a full platoon (completely undivided into different hexs) dumped on the base.      /rambling"

Briggs,3dvzr2,TheFullCologne,9,Mon Jul 20 05:42:48 2015 UTC,"Congrats on RSNC for winning that match!! As the squad leader for TROL, that last round was brilliantly done by you guys with the smoke and shotties. It was quite hard to push back in after that. We thought we would have the advantage of the southern sundy but it was a hard fought battle. It was an honour for us TROL to make RSNC bring their best against us ,while many still think that we may just be a mindless zerg. It will be a lesson we will learn,appreciate and adapt.   To be honest, I didnt expect us to that well, but well I trusted my TROL guys and they are the reason I still play this game =D. Props to all the TROL players that joined and train with me to reach to this stage. Though in disappointment and frustration, TROL will be back and hopefully will meet RSNC in the finals. We may fall, we may crawl but sure as hell, we wont be going down without a roar.    PS : Fuck u CHING :("

Briggs,3dvzr2,Sen7ryGun,2,Mon Jul 20 10:29:20 2015 UTC,"Im not the only leader at the moment, RetroAramis1 and Gumbyz(still kinda though retired) are still leaders within planetside, Im just mainly in charge of community event and tournament on ps2 in TROL and mainly training up the infantry aspect of the game within the TROL community.   No really big direction changes , its just that currently we are on plans to downsize the outfit in game into a smaller and tighter outfit as we are trying to push ppl to come into TS to join us. My kinda style is very similar to most ppl call elitefits kinda style where we do pointholds and putting them in shit all places which they wish to be dead rather than alive to improve them. So yeah, been trying to reduce ppl calling us a zergfit for a very long time but it comes with the name so not gonna do much abt it but just prove it ourselves that we can be as good as certain outfits. And if anyone wants a friendly scrim against us feel free to contact me.   BUT, we are forever a casual community but with a core group of ppl within that goes for all this tournaments and such to further improve themselves. I still do recommend ppl who just wanna chill and do something different to go for unbless's sundy ball if they wanna change of pace or even jump into other ppl outfit ts to have a feel of other ppl leading and all.  Yeah! your welcome! =D"
Briggs,3dvzr2,GoatsCheese2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:57:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah sorry about the Zergfit thing, was fun at the time.   RetroAramis is a player/commander I have liked for a long time and now your name gets bounced around a lot as well by anyone talking about TROL.   Outfits naturally take on the style of their most active commanders, my only patronising advice I would have for you, as one TROL cheese to another, think about the policy of 'freedom to command', we at R18 (part of the TROL family tree) simply support anyone who decides to command, to do it their way, and members are expected to be smart enough to deal with it. That way, players like Gumbyz are supported while he runs old school TROL styles while at the same time you are free to pursue RSNC style agenda.   Massive good luck to you Kenzan, there is a lot of love and admiration from us in R18 for the old MotherOutfit TROL, how does it feel to be heading up such a grand old girl like TROL?   We we're working this out the other day, TROL has directly spawned, EDGE, Suddenly Certs, Renegade 18, while also supplying GAB with many of its Best, it's quite the establishment as far as briggs is concerned.....

Briggs,3dvzr2,PeRXeRs,4,Mon Jul 20 08:10:34 2015 UTC,^ Resident smoke shitlord reporting for duty.
Briggs,3dvzr2,NZNed,4,Mon Jul 20 02:34:06 2015 UTC,"Goats - It was definitely a master stroke ZE7A tried smoke in our match at Pale Canyon.  Didn't really work for them in a open point.  The combination of smoke, indoor cap, shot guns and NC Max at Ghanan Southern was a game changer."
Briggs,3dvzr2,Dylan_NZL,4,Mon Jul 20 07:26:42 2015 UTC,"Was that you playing the engineer?   Hearing Azure commentating about the smoke was lol.   This is how azure sounds commentating - http://youtu.be/y4CXY6TVBMc  How me and Picard were talking about the match -  http://youtu.be/dTg2gUOAa6o 😂  I would say it was your smoking that made the crucial difference in round three, good choice to use it in the last round, it changed the pace and gave you the breathing room you guys needed to break TROLs momentum.   Who's idea was it to play smoke?"
Briggs,3dvzr2,Dylan_NZL,3,Mon Jul 20 03:02:15 2015 UTC,"We had to nullify TROL's push from the south which was clearly the most advantageous position to attack. Nobody really thought the smoke would work so I yolo'd to give it a shot, but I would only target the smoke at the 3 entrances so TROL would be smoked off but out boys would maintain visibility.  We basically had CQC right outside the smoke so as soon as they got LOS/got out of the smoke they had a shotgun/MAX right in front of them."
Briggs,3dvzr2,NZNed,2,Mon Jul 20 04:10:14 2015 UTC,SMOKE B TUNNELS AND PLAY IT CLOSE
Briggs,3dvzr2,Gabba202,3,Mon Jul 20 10:32:09 2015 UTC,"From my view, which was top down thanks to Azures camera work, you could see the smoke cause a crisis of confidence as the individual players of TROL edged backwards from the enveloping cloud.  So, it was litterally decided on that second? Your people weren't using NV scopes? That really was a balls to the wall moment for RSNC if that's the case, despite the risk, you made the game changing call, and RSNCs ability to adapt to that decision is impressive.   Any comments relating to TROLs performance in that match? Were you guys as shocked as myself and others at the abilities of TROL to wrangle that A point off RSNC and keep it?"
Briggs,3dvzr2,spudmonkey12345,2,Mon Jul 20 04:29:29 2015 UTC,"People didnt know I was going for operation smoko until I started smoking so I dont think any1 had HSNV (except me). But the advantage of me having it was I could easily spot targets so my other guys could see the doritos above their head, thus making them easier to target.  Its fair to say TROL had surprised everybody with that opening. We probably didn't take advantage of our 3 LA play during round 1 to flank from behind. Given a lot of us played in farmers we already knew that the south spawn was advantageous but in a 12v12 we didn't know the extent of the advantage until half-way through that first round. We were pretty startled in that first round."
Briggs,3dvzr2,crushdepth5thFaction,3,Mon Jul 20 04:40:17 2015 UTC,"TROL winning the first round (thanks for helping me remember ha) made it a great watch from twitch. Just didn't expect it from an outfit many expected would be struggling after its recent leadership shuffle. Props to Kenzan, he was just a minor scrubling during my tenency at the top of TROL.   RSNC on the 2nd round had a lovely last second clutch if I remember, was a professional finish but did leave us all wondering who would take round 3. But then cometh the hour, cometh the Goatscheese, that on the spot thinking was the key to round three and makes you Man of the Match in my books. 👍"
Briggs,3dvzr2,ReltorTR,3,Mon Jul 20 04:57:27 2015 UTC,"That smoke and shotguns really screwed us over, nobody was running HS/NV until you guys really started smoking the place out. Even with the scopes those shotguns gave us no reaction time and the smoke covered your movements. Ching's max practice worked well for you guys. Nothing like getting Insta-gibbed by a max you can't see."

I'm one of the leaders of the Gun Runners [GunR] on Vanu, the other leader being BandanaDee. We are an active outfit with at least a small squad just about every night. We'll happily take on new players and show them the ropes. We have players with various playstyles and vehicle/aircraft specialisations(infantry, tankers, pilots, drivers, gunners, commanders, etc) who are happy to teach people and answer questions.  Due to our smaller outfit size, we tend to play on a squad level, (4-12 players) with a bit of a combined arms approach, with occasional larger public platoons (2-4 squads). We try not to take ourselves too seriously though, after all the main point of a game is to have fun. :D  If you want to try us out join us on Teamspeak 3: nubnub.typefrag.com or 54.153.170.35:7105 (same server, sometimes we get DNS issues) or add me as a friend in game, IGN:Valkryir or Send an application to the GunRunners via the ingame outfit browser."

Basically, we do a bunch of random shit with vehicles, infantry and aircraft and we like to have fun. RichiesGhost (one of the other high ranking members) wants to get us to be a bit more serious, so every now and again we'll have a ""serious"" squad where we actually play the game for an hour or two, as opposed to derping around.  We're a very laid-back group, and we play a lot of other games, like  Dirty Bomb, Rust, etc. We accept everyone (as long as you're not too inappropriate or immature) and we love to play games together.  If you join us, you can expect a lot of teamkilling, laughing, crying and shouting and we'll do our best to make you feel at home."

All mid-tier outfits that I know help players all the time. I'd suggest FCLM as we're a casual bunch of veterans with recently a few new blokes but it might be a bit of a brutal introduction given we're already knowledgeable to the game however we have ~15+ BR100's in a ~30+ group, we might be small but we can pack a punch ;)  P.S. Not trying to plug , TAW8 and GunR are probably best for very new players. We have a dank website mono made tho."
Briggs,3du795,CaptainLaserFace,3,Sun Jul 19 21:48:35 2015 UTC,"The best thing for you to do is try before you buy.   Try different factions before you commit to one, so that you can see which guns you like and which style of public gameplay you like. Join public platoons on each faction and see which style of leadership you like, because each faction only has a handful of public platoon leaders and so you'll be encountering them a lot if you want to be in large scale platoons.  If you've done that, and your heart is set on the VS, then try the different outfits. Join them on teamspeak and see if you gel with the players, and if you have fun with them. See if they can muster up numbers on the days/nights you play, or if they're basically a deadfit.   When you've found the right outfit for you, you'll know about it."

All factions have to endure a boring spell of ghost caps from time to time when the other factions fight each other. Doesn't make it OK to try and force a 3 way fight and screw the alert for yourself just because you weren't having fun for a few minutes.  Bottom line is, you can do with your squad what you want. But when you capture a base like Snowshear and expect your VS friends to not stay there for the farm and defend against the TR for the alert. You shouldn't be complaining on Reddit about how it is everyone Else's fault."

The alert also started with TR at the NC warpgate (courtesy of a DickMoveTM) and VS did cap 50% territory up to the 1:15 mark.   Alert here: http://ps2alerts.com/Alert/9306  Not that that should detract from the main point of the thread which is territory game should take precedence over easy farm.  I remember cutting off NC completely from snowshear but still they fought there."
Briggs,3duf8e,TurtleYo,6,Sun Jul 19 16:42:23 2015 UTC,"Do you know why we fought there?  We were being rolled at EVERY single other base by overpop and cancer, it was the only base I could get a kill in a relatively safe environment.  TR and VS should be ashamed of themselves after that pitiful double team.  EDIT: Down votes for pointing out that there are always 2 enemy factions in the game for TR/VS, must be good cause NC has 3!"
Briggs,3duf8e,Tinuva450,6,Mon Jul 20 00:38:52 2015 UTC,"It happens to VS too, y'know?"
Briggs,3duf8e,MadMaukh,5,Mon Jul 20 02:25:08 2015 UTC,"So often VS get double teamed on a incredible scale. There was a horrific Indar alert the other day that was just a shit show, A2G at every fight and couldn't actually get anywhere. Spawn room warriors at every base I visited."
Briggs,3duf8e,MadMaukh,4,Mon Jul 20 03:38:31 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt, it is atrocious."
Briggs,3duf8e,er1992,2,Mon Jul 20 02:29:44 2015 UTC,"And TR! It's like.. every faction has the same experience..in a three faction game..  holy shit you guys, I think DBG finally balanced the factions. /s."
Briggs,3duf8e,pedrotski,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:40:45 2015 UTC,"it was the only base I could get a kill in a relatively safe environment.   So you wanted to farm. Nothing wrong with that, just call it for what it is. We joined in the snowshear farm ourselves after re securing TR territory."
Briggs,3duf8e,Tinuva450,9,Mon Jul 20 10:23:00 2015 UTC,"If a random bunch of TR shitters (<3 u JUGA/RIP) is able to ghostcap the entirety of a continent because everyone is shitting around at an easy farm on live, I'm not fucking surprised that we keep losing at SS.  You want to win an SS, improve your bloody live play.  Now yes, I do understand that this is late night, but this is no fucking excuse. Get your shit together, Briggs."
Briggs,3duf8e,pedrotski,4,Sun Jul 19 16:09:40 2015 UTC,"Ye after switching to Esamir, there was only one RIP online (me) and I logged shortly after that and never even saw any of this.   Edit: what have i started? Lol"
Briggs,3duf8e,Tinuva450,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:27:09 2015 UTC,Yeah we logged on with 1 hour to go and finished the job with about 5 of us to secure the domination. The start we had nothing to do with. NC did have the majority pop however like usual and still did nothing with it.
Briggs,3duf8e,Ridiculisk1,2,Mon Jul 20 03:10:12 2015 UTC,"I'll bite, I can't recall what our pop was when Esamir started, but even if we had say 40%, do you expect us to do much when TR & VS concentrated solely on us?"
Briggs,3duf8e,Tinuva450,3,Mon Jul 20 03:39:58 2015 UTC,"In the initial first half, You can TRY and get organized and push 1 lane and just forget the other faction all together. But key word there is TRY and other people need to be willing to help you. After that the faction would be pretty demoralized so it would be hard."
Briggs,3duf8e,Ridiculisk1,-2,Mon Jul 20 03:54:16 2015 UTC,"mate it was absolutely shocking once Esamir started, double teaming one faction is not healthy for this game.  EDIT, I am guessing by the number of down votes it is healthy?"
Briggs,3duf8e,Tinuva450,6,Mon Jul 20 00:36:54 2015 UTC,"NC were getting double teamed? By the picture, it looks like TR was buttfucking both factions."
Briggs,3duf8e,twistedrapier,2,Mon Jul 20 02:00:23 2015 UTC,"When Esamir first opened we were being jumped on both fronts and we couldn't get traction anywhere. For the period I was on, there was only a fair fight at Snowshear everything else was cancer and overpop. We were warpgated and but still held Snowshear which by the looks of it eventually got taken when new reinforcements couldn't spawn there. I am guessing once TR had warpgated NC, they realized there was this whole new faction called VS so they turned their attention to them."
Briggs,3duf8e,Tinuva450,5,Mon Jul 20 02:27:56 2015 UTC,"Every faction gets double teamed at times, and every faction pulls cancer shit. 'tis a part of the current game unfortunately."

Briggs,3duf8e,Shepherd336,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:35:51 2015 UTC,"And the TR were being double teamed by the NC and VS for the duration of the Hossin and Amerish alerts before the switch to Esamir.  Only thing that saved them from getting overrun by the constant galaxy pop dumps was the overall pop skew.  Pop dump meta is a constant cancer on Briggs, no matter the faction."

Briggs,3duf8e,DrMcCrank,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:44:15 2015 UTC,"Not going to lie, there was some massive meat grinders with large pops fighting over the points. But you are more often than not going to be double teamed if you are winning an alert.  Esamir just started, TR held all 3 continents and yet NC were warpgated by both factions..."
Briggs,3duf8e,Gabba202,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:46:59 2015 UTC,"So why are you complaining about double teaming then?  That shit happens to all the factions.  Yesterday, during the day, it was the VS bitching about getting picked on.  The NC aren't some special flowers, being constantly victimised.  You're just getting a taste of what the TR and VS have been dealing with for the last couple of months when the NC world pop skewed heavily.  Besides, that Emasir alert started at midnight on a Sunday.  You'd be looking at maybe 100-150 players tops.  Those percentages are going to swing widely just based on the joining/leaving of a single squad."
Briggs,3duf8e,TheFullCologne,2,Mon Jul 20 02:54:27 2015 UTC,"Nah it's not healthy, you're right (as there are many other things that aren't healthy about some play styles). But as pointed out by others it happens to all the factions at times. I haven't honestly been able to Crack the code of when and why it happens? It's definitely not about the pop. Even low pop factions have it done to them sometimes."
Briggs,3duf8e,DerpyNerdy,4,Mon Jul 20 03:45:35 2015 UTC,And I <3 BananaDee and you too
Briggs,3duf8e,Valkryir,10,Sun Jul 19 23:30:44 2015 UTC,"Yes it is a fucking excuse, some of us have more important and stressful things to worry about in life than the fucking territory in a game late at night on a Sunday. And don't treat this period in the game like all 240 people that attend server smash were online allowing this to happen in the first place, get a grip."

Briggs,3duf8e,Gabba202,2,Sun Jul 19 16:29:31 2015 UTC,"It's not that alert that's the problem, it's the Amerish alert we did earlier in the night. We had the chance to do a primetime alert and pre-alert on our next SS continent and we spent it tag teaming and pop-sinking one another instead of coming to a gentleman's agreement and keeping the fights balanced."
Briggs,3duf8e,DefenestrateMyStyle,2,Sun Jul 19 16:58:27 2015 UTC,"A ""gentleman's agreement"" isn't going to help anyone but. In SS anything can happen, It needs to be the same on live. People just need to be willing to react to the situation. And right now not many people are willing to fight."
Briggs,3duf8e,Ilandar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:37:22 2015 UTC,"Anything can happen apart from one side outnumbering the other side two to one. It's hard to learn to react to any situation when you can't go to a relatively balanced fight, or can't be bothered to do so.  Most of the 1000 players that come and go during a primetime alert don't attend SS and aren't interested in helping out those that do, but that doesn't mean that those do do attend and are interested in helping out should take a 'not my problem' attitude when fights are grossly unbalanced."
Briggs,3duf8e,Tinuva450,3,Mon Jul 20 08:15:53 2015 UTC,"that's the kind of shit that I see all the time though. (the double teaming and pop sinking, that is).  The other servers have decent live play which means they're almost always practicing for SS. Thanks to us being locked to one continent, we're stuck with an absolute shitfest almost 24/7, which leaves almost no chance to actually get some real practice going for SS. When our live play is cancer, our SS play will be cancer because that's all we know."
Briggs,3duf8e,DrakeAU,7,Sun Jul 19 17:22:45 2015 UTC,I'm willing to bet a vast amount of things that you actually have no valid idea on other servers' live play.
Briggs,3duf8e,Nerbskee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:47:39 2015 UTC,"I've played a bit on Connery, and from what I saw there is that cancer from the VS zergs and all that shit.  But there's also the leetfits with their small fights because they can do that on the secondary continent. We can't. If we just have our one continent filled with zergs, cancer and shitty farms then where the hell is the opportunity to learn the game? How can we develop sundy placement and base pushing skills if there's 7 sundies already at the base with two platoons sitting on point? How can we learn how and where to push a lane if there's twenty-odd prowlers/vannys sitting and shelling the fuck out of every spawn room?  The other servers have the option for multiple styles of live play thanks to have multiple continents. We don't."
Briggs,3duf8e,BestOfTheBeasts,2,Mon Jul 20 04:35:54 2015 UTC,Oh my god it's almost like you just explained Briggs! There's outfits that zerg and do fuck all and there's a select few outfits that play tactical and do point holds! Who knew!?!?    Multiple continents means nothing it just gives people the option to ghost cap
Briggs,3duf8e,-unbless-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:39:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, except at the moment, the tacticalfits aren't exactly enough at the moment. We've got RSNC, JUGA, SW2G and a few others but even if we stack teams with all of those guys, we don't have the numbers for a 240 smash.  The other servers have no problem thanks to having 2-3 times as much population. We're struggling for numbers, and our % of leet players will be much less thanks to all the vets leaving. We need to bring up the skill of our average players, and farming/zerging ain't gonna help with that."
Briggs,3duf8e,-unbless-,4,Mon Jul 20 04:47:15 2015 UTC,Then maybe we should just accept Briggs for what it is and enjoy the rest of the ride

Briggs,3dt4ls,twistedrapier,2,Mon Jul 20 09:54:12 2015 UTC,After being wargated by VS twice yesterday (and almost a third time) it's probably be going to be hard for you to get any of us NC who aren't fourth factioners to play VS.
Briggs,3dt4ls,-unbless-,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:14:13 2015 UTC,Generally vs do quite well in terms of pubs. TR>VS>NC has been my experience.
Briggs,3dt4ls,Cloudy87VS,0,Sun Jul 19 09:01:14 2015 UTC,You just happened to play when the all the competent VS players were off enjoying life.  Same thing happens on the TR and NC sides frequently.  No one is going to give up on a faction just because of the lack of coordination during a play session.
Briggs,3dt4ls,-unbless-,-18,Sun Jul 19 06:30:05 2015 UTC,"nah, let it happen... then briggs will die and we'll get connery transfers"

Briggs,3dt4ls,-unbless-,2,Sun Jul 19 06:48:49 2015 UTC,"Why would it even make me blink?  I mean... its not like i don't cop a metric fuck ton of shit every day.  Trust me when i say, the salt is evident in what they do to ""counter"" me.... as if there is some kind of need to do so... with my 1.5 squads of BR18 players.  stuff like:-   Dedicated BR1 TK'ing alts with names like ""fuckoffunbless"" Dedicated multiboxing spies. Dedicated downvote armadas on reddit. Dedicated TR/NC alliances with a  singular commitment to warpgating an already sickly VS. Dedicated GM impersonators.   This could go on... but most people will already be at the point of TL;DR.  suffice to say i am glad that people with such foresight will set themselves to the task of targeting VS... that ticket to connery cant come soon enough. THANKS TR/NC!"

At the end of the day i think people just enjoy stirring shit and clicking downvote is the most efficient method... its also the most risk averse method... they wouldn't want to be drawn into an open debate about an issue... as it might accidentally end up resolving things."

Briggs,3dixae,Calopix,3,Fri Jul 17 12:49:35 2015 UTC,"Stop sacrificing acc to get HSR. It's better to have 30acc and 25ish HSR than what you have. Also organized 1v1s are a waste of time for Infantry as there is very rarely any times when you run into even 1v1 situations on live.   If you want to improve just take that mindset and play solo for a while. Playing solo forces you to look after yourself, deal with your mistakes, and not get in the mindset that someone else will clean up after you."
Briggs,3dixae,UnnamedSG,2,Fri Jul 17 02:19:24 2015 UTC,"I'd say there's a balance between the two. Sometimes it's better if you've got a clean drop on someone to aim for headshots, whereas in tight CQC as you put it elsewhere you're better off landing guaranteed hits than missing while aiming for headshots.   I don't see any issues with trying to improve your 1v1 performance. While there's rarely a fair, uninterrupted 1v1 engagement, if you can improve upon your ability to deal with a single target, it translates when you can control your engagement terms.   I agree that the best thing you can do is keep your mentality to improve. That alone will give you the desire to learn and adapt, to see your flaws and your strengths. It's good to be able to ask for advice from other skilled players, too. By being observed (either against or together), you can get valuable feedback that you might not have access to otherwise.   I'd say it's also good to learn to play in a team environment, so you can fully utilize all those skills you hone when you play alone.   *Edit: I'd also say that by constantly working on headshots you can actually improve your speed and accuracy over time. As you're aiming for a smaller target (and subject to all the usual bullshit with movement/hitboxes etc.) you'll naturally have a lower accuracy than if you aim center-mass. It gives you a higher skill-cap to work towards, and for some people it's just a personal meta. Seeing how far you can push yourself.   Your overall accuracy depends a lot on the gun and the engagement ranges, slower firing guns or weapons designed purely for CQC will often have higher accuracy, whereas guns that you push outside their intended or close ranges will suffer.   Don't take this as a condescending reply to your post, Calo, I know you're already aware of this stuff, it was more just getting thoughts out there."
Briggs,3dixae,KyesaRRi,0,Fri Jul 17 15:24:32 2015 UTC,"Stop sacrificing acc to get HSR.   Well I spam a lot at chokes, empty doorways, super long range targets that I have zero hope of killing, etc. My alt has 27%acc when i don't do stupid stuff, but eh, it's part of the habits i might kick i guess.    And yeah I play solo 99% of the time, I just have a very PTFO mindset that I sacrifice a lot for and it pisses me off when nobody exploits the ground I just gained for the team. :S    you free for ivi? It's good practice, finding a good balanced fight on briggs is impossible nowadays, and my ping to connery is kaput @ 200"
Briggs,3dixae,UnnamedSG,0,Fri Jul 17 05:51:43 2015 UTC,If you're not shooting at a target don't shoot. Spamming a chokepoint without hit markers is wasting your time and bullets that could be needed later.  Also I don't play anymore and never will again due to it being an utterly trash game and the fact there are much better games for Infantry play without having to deal with skillless shitlords in tanks and planes.

Briggs,3dixae,spudmonkey12345,2,Fri Jul 17 05:09:02 2015 UTC,"accuracy is dependant on ranges you fight at, ping and skill  if you have over 250 ping, you will generally never get over 27% accuracy on any gun, if you shoot at any target you can reasonably kill, regardless of range, your accuracy takes a huge hit too (If i play cqc only, I can easily finish sessions with 35/33% acc/hsr with the t9 carv, but since i fight at all ranges, my acc and hsr take a huge hit everytime theres an open field, which is very common for me since i LOVE open field fights.  TL;DR version; the accuracy you should care about is based on your own playstyle and shouldnt be compared to others."

I realise this is only the second one and you may not have finalised your plans/methods etc. but I just want some pretty basic information because right now (and I noticed this on the original thread too) you don't really tell people what it is. Unless you went to the last one you have no idea what to expect. It's some shadowy enigma that leaves people like myself wondering whether we should actually show up.  How much of the lesson is expected to be us sitting in a TS channel listening to the ""drill sergeant"" talk about things and stuffs?  Are we split up into factions? And if so does each faction have a different drill sergeant? And how standardised will the training be across factions? Do the drill sergeants have a detailed plan and/or script to ensure they all cover the same topics and each faction receives a comparable experience?  How much of the exercise is us in-game playing? And what are we going to be doing when in-game? Just rocking up to a random base to fight some random people while attempting to follow orders and executing specific holds? Or are we going to fight each other? (one drill sergeant and his minions pitted against the other[s])  How long are these exercises expected to go for? 1-hour? 2? 4?  Are we able to get a better idea on what exactly is going to be covered? Is it going to be centered around individual skills, or team skills (knowing how to best compliment your squad and those around you)?  BTW: good on you for helping the community. I haven't played in months and have decided to start playing again so I'll be sure to be there."
Briggs,3db45x,crushdepth5thFaction,3,Wed Jul 15 06:22:11 2015 UTC,"He doesn't actually know exactly what will be in it, because like he said, the drill sergeants are running it, not him. most I could tell you is that it will probably go for around a bit over an hour, it will probably be split into factions, and that would have different drilly's the last thingy was mostly us just listening to a guy talk in ts, though this one will probably be more hands on"

Briggs,3dbf18,DrakeAU,2,Wed Jul 15 04:37:23 2015 UTC,"It's been off and on. Some people log on fine and others get the error message saying that the server is not available. AFAIK it's random in who experiences this and when they experience this.  Last night I got the message when I tried to log  into my briggs TR, so I decided I would play on my connery account. As soon as I clicked my Connery account to select it instantly logged me in, but to my Briggs account. Later I logged off and tried logging back in and got the same message, I just waited a while (about 30 seconds) and then I logged into the account anyway.  TL:DR weird shits still going on, randomly effects people. Seems you can bypass it somehow through luck and/or loginside waiting."

In this instance NC started with majority bases so it makes sense to attack them but that majority lead was only 1 base."
Briggs,3d95mq,RichiesGhost,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:48:02 2015 UTC,"From a TR perspective it was just VS and NC zergs on both our fronts. I glanced at the VS/NC front a few times during the first hour and there was not a single battle taking place. JUGA got TR organised with about an hour to go and from there we concentrated on pushing back the VS which lead to some successful (albeit grindy) caps. The NC didn't seem to care about the alert, though, they were happy to just zerg us for the entirety. Pretty sad when that kind of thing happens in a three faction game."
Briggs,3d95mq,AxisBond,2,Tue Jul 14 16:23:32 2015 UTC,"From a VS perspective (as well as a leading a three squad platoon and using command chat perspective), it was a TR/NC zerg on both our fronts pre-alert as well as in the second half of alert. The TR zerg up the Jaeger's/Andvari lattice only got as far as it did because we were so busy defending Waterson's, Saerro, and the Mani region that we largely agreed to leave it be once we lost Jaegers.  The NC got within 3% of winning the alert so someone managed to care. Locking down the TR front in the Ymir region was the best thing they could have done in that alert as that was pretty much the only place the TR could push them after the VS took the Waterson's/Ymir lattice.   ISNC did a great job collapsing the Mani region and taking advantage of the VS being hit by the TR at Jaegers and Watersons, and by the NC at Saerro. If the alert had lasted another five to ten minutes the VS would have lost because of it."
Briggs,3d95mq,TheFullCologne,3,Tue Jul 14 16:37:47 2015 UTC,"Nah. Pre-alert it was VS and NC focusing on each other, which allowed TR to cap about 50% of the map, attacking NC and VS equally. It really only changed when TR attacked Saerro, which caused a significant amount of NC to leave Mani to defend that. VS used that opportunity to take Mani, and TR still took Saerro. It was at that point that TR started getting double teamed. Which was absolutely fair enough, as we had highest population and highest territory.  By the time the alert had started, VS had both highest population and highest territory, but the TR double-team continued for another hour until we were almost warpgated (with lowest population and being significantly out-popped at every base we had) and VS had an almost unassailable lead."

Briggs,3d95mq,diamondwing,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:06:09 2015 UTC,"People zerged because they didn't have an option. With the VS locking down Jaeger's and Waterson's it only left the TR the Ymir region to push. With the VS locking down Mani Fortress and Saerro it only left the NC the Ymir region to push.   People also zerged because the opportunity was there, because there wasn't enough resistance, and as part as an overall gameplan. VS deliberately overextended to the Rink and Apex Genetics so that NC would eat up the clock before they could hit Saerro (the Apex fight was awesome fun btw) and we did the same with Bridge Ward and Old Shore Checkpoint to protect Watersons."

Briggs,3d8ybv,XCVJoRDANXCV,6,Tue Jul 14 14:10:58 2015 UTC,"Sigh..   Unless you have a very experienced & coordinated outfit, you wont be able to cap a lot of those bases with even pop. & now that you cant redeploy to defend with 51%+ pop some outfits will stack the pops a bit to ensure it gets defended. - therefore rendering about 1/4 - 1/3 of your screenshots completely irrelevant. Especially your first one of 12-24 taking a biolab against 1-12... hell I'd even be say 25-48 would be fine (as long as it was no more than 3-1 pop - 3squads v 1squad) as you need to commit a certain amount to ensure the cap against those last minute redeploys. Not every outfit is like JUGA or RSNC for example & able to cap a bio at 1-1 or 1-2 odds.  What time of the day was this? It could be 8am in the morning & people are just playing to chill/relax/practice aim/positioning etc rather than playing a fast paced territory capture mode.  Yes some of the screenshots are entirely justified & as a platoon pushing a lane of single point bases against one squad is fucking retarded. But thats been happening since day 1 & is no worse now than it used to be!  A leader gets organised, spreads his forces well & pushes territory fairly & does well & he gets abused for ruining fights & playing ""too seriously""..  Blaming certain outfits is a bit pathetic too. Because in the same breath you will be accusing them of ghost capping when they push the only uncontested lane with 12-24 to avoid over-popping a fight. If anything the Leaders on the other factions are just as much to blame (if you want to play that game) for not organising their own forces to bring a competitive fight!  This has always happened & always will on every server. It is just more evident on Briggs because we lack the population to hide it. - People still need to be able to relax & just play the game how they feel like at the time. Yes it will upset others, but an hour later things will be the other way around & the Circle of Life continues to go around..  In short its not worth getting your tits in a tangle cause its just a game. Only a very few people on this server are capable of playing in a tactically organised manner for more than 1 hour & most of them are pretty burnt out themselves & just want to relax.  & TCFB..? Lol if they had more than 6 players online during the week at the same time then I'd be rejoicing if I was you as most of them don't play outside their Ops sadly"

Briggs,3d8ybv,ThatBaddyAsVanu,3,Wed Jul 15 07:52:08 2015 UTC,"Zerging can be a good thing as there are fights in SS that do get that big. The unfortunate thing is that the factions that are being zerged against don't co-ordinate to get enough population to counter the zerg. Think about SS in it's entirety, whenever you get to a big base like Fort Drexler, a Tech Plant, an Amp Station, a Bio Lab etc., you'll quite often get a significant portion of the popuation during SS at that fight either trying to capture or defend it. The issue isn't the zerging, it's people's willingness to learn to deal with the zerg and learn how to counter it."
Briggs,3d8ybv,NocturnalGannet,3,Tue Jul 14 16:23:26 2015 UTC,"On Briggs we often see one faction getting zerged on both fronts by the other two factions, though. Coordination doesn't come into it if you don't actually have the numbers to effectively counter."
Briggs,3d8ybv,Ilandar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:35:27 2015 UTC,"True and also not true. Sometimes the allied forces aren't coordinated enough to stop that from happening but I remember one alert recently on Indar where the VS had managed to capture Quartz Ridge, Dahaka Amp, The Crown and Tawrich Tech and were using those bases as choke points for the end of the alert. Both the NC and TR focused pretty much their entire forces against the VS at Dahaka Amp and Tawrich Tech and the VS were coordinated enough to split their forces across the 2 bases will having small squads deal with a few weak points in the front. The VS did eventually lose Dahaka Amp and Tawrich Tech but they held out against superior numbers for a good 30 minutes at least from memory.  I know that it's not always possible to deal with zergs but quite often if you use command chat, you'll find that there are actually enough coordinated forces running around to deal with a zerg."
Briggs,3d8ybv,NocturnalGannet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:57:06 2015 UTC,"I just unlocked command chat recently with the intent to do that, actually."
Briggs,3d8ybv,Ilandar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:33:42 2015 UTC,"You dont have the numbers to deal with it on both fronts, but you normally have the numbers to deal with it one front - so, ideally, you allow one faction to zerg whilst you deal with the other and make sure they don't go too far. Sooner or later, that faction will break and they will start pushing the other faction. That's when you go to work on the other faction and reclaim whatever territory they took, whilst being sure to put out any fires that the arise on the front you were originally defending."
Briggs,3d8ybv,RichiesGhost,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:02:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was exacrly what Axis organised last night. It's pretty useful when JUGA use /orders, actually, because there's usually only one public zerg platoon on TR who have no idea what they're doing. If there's a SOCA or PG12 platoon open I'll join that, but otherwise I'm generally playing solo and just trying to guess where the best place to push/defend will be."
Briggs,3d8ybv,Ilandar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:39:29 2015 UTC,"When in doubt, defend rather than attack as it's usually better to save a base than to try to capture one.   If you don't want to defend or don't need to defend, then go after the single point bases and leave the triple point bases, Biolabs, Tech Plants, and Amps stations alone unless you have a significant force at your back or you can manage a sneaky cap.   If you have multiple single point bases to choose from, go for the ones that aren't satellites for large bases - you will run into a satellite or a large base sooner or later, but if you have captured several single point bases beforehand you should have enough momentum going to push the bigger base through.   If you don't have the momentum built up to take the larger base, go find another single point base.  If you're attacking a base and it's going nowhere, pull out and find another single point base."
Briggs,3d8ybv,RichiesGhost,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:48:55 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I do, actually! Since I can't guarantee reinforcements I usually pick a single point base and just try to run down the counter for as long as I can by myself. Sometimes a friendly squad comes to help out but often the best thing I achieve is just drawing a couple of VS/NC squads away from the zerg which will hopefully give TR an advantage somewhere else."

Briggs,3d8ybv,Ilandar,2,Wed Jul 15 03:14:17 2015 UTC,"I get frustrated watching a zerg hitting one base at a time, while their faction loses 2 bases for every base they take on other fronts.   With the amount of casuals and solo players we have on Briggs, it's difficult to organise a group to counter a zerg some times. Most will either just go and try to farm the overpop, or if it's just a shit fest and heavily spawn camped base to base, they will just ignore that front and look for fights elsewhere."
Briggs,3d8ybv,BUnit3,2,Tue Jul 14 23:55:25 2015 UTC,"I agree that it can be difficult to organise a group to counter a zerg at times.  If I'm running solo and see a zerg, I'll sometimes just grab a tank or harrasser and have fun destroying the enemies vehicles. Even though that may not stop a zerg, it'll help for when allied reinforcements do come."
Briggs,3d8ybv,NocturnalGannet,2,Wed Jul 15 01:24:16 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure, I love getting a sky guard out and trying to pick off some of the A2G attack, or at least sway a gal from sitting over the spawn room with bulldogs."
Briggs,3d8ybv,BUnit3,0,Wed Jul 15 01:26:42 2015 UTC,"Zerging is only useful practice, only if the defenders use every scrap of defensible terrain and practice holding out with smaller pop. What actually happens is players sit in the spawn room or otherwise lazily farm the zergers, or they go all out maxes. Going all out maxes is the norm for SS on both sides, so it's not useful practice going against a non max zerg not using any tactics.  Using maxes against a non-max zerg does not require coordination and good use of defensible terrain, so it doesn't buildiup any useful skill.  Then you've got to consider zerging leaves the zerglings doing nothing, which results in no improvement in skill whatsoever, and no exitement which results in lower attachment to PS2. Fights between more even forces (not necessarily even numbers) are more likely to cause game-play which builds better skills."
Briggs,3d8ybv,voinni2014,15,Wed Jul 15 04:33:32 2015 UTC,"TRIGGER WARNING  Please enlighten me as to how anything on live even vaguely applies to SS....  lets apply your own logic to your comments...  How does getting angry on reddit about what happens on live win us the SS?  How/when do you, as a commander, lead anything that actively puts a stop to gameplay styles you personally dislike on live AND how would that then benefit us with regards to SS?  Final question. Do you even lead? ... do you even have the vaguest idea how challenging it is to lead more than 12 people who may have never played the game before against some of the best players on the planet????  Without a doubt:- the pub herding commanders are some of the last hope this server has got of keeping briggs PS2 above the scale you get in common titles like Battlefield and CS.GO. This is why i do what i do... and there are those that stand with me... even though i can be a condescending, cock juggling, thunder-cunt.  but... hey, keep chipping away at everyones morale and PS2 will be dead soon... it'll get there with help like yours ;)  I hate to say this.. but your opinion sounds like we should all become JUGA and RSNC... OR go die in a fire....  NEWSFLASH:- most of those guys started somewhere... not all, to be sure... but MOST of them started in one of the zergfits and some even have alts in one or all of the zergfits when they feel like playing in a less risk averse manner... when they DONT want to worry about SS tacticoolshit™ or any of the other pressures of bushidoshide.  NOW, I honestly mean ZERO OFFENCE to the outfits of this server that have classed themselves up to a high degree of skill per capita... takes a deep fkn breath and prepares to commit reddit sudoku   CONSIDER THIS...  What if all the zergfits leave... and all you have on briggs is RSNC and JUGA...? no seriously.... what will you do WITHOUT the farmable quantities to pad your KD's and to flesh out our numbers for participation in big events like server smash.?  All of a sudden those fappable KD's start taking a hit... skills being matched man to man.  participation in SS:- off the table -period.  Whining anonymous redditards™ find something new to whinge about in relation to the only people still playing the dedest fkn game EVER.   And then... you finally put the nail in the coffin with ALL your whinging bullshit and Briggs dies for real...  clap clap clap... so to answer the question of  ""was it worth it""  YES:- by the fkn gods it was worth it to see if any so called commander would look at he map and say... ""aww shit we better turn up to X hex and defend i suppose""  I regret fuck all, I helped secure a nice bonus for VS, it only took 30 odd mins AND we still didn't get fucked over on Indar because i watched the map the entire time and decided not to worry about the hexes that we WEREN'T losing on Indar. FURTHERMORE:- this bonus came fairly cheap with just ONE bitchpost™ on the reddit pricetag.  I have no fkn clue who you are... but every post you make, it becomes less and less possible that you or your opinions are in any way important to the leaders on this server. There is never anything constructive about what you say... or even how you say it. You just link bunch of screen shots and bleat uselessly about how unskilled x activity is and how it wont help SS.... how embarrassingly ironic it must be for you to realize that you have also contributed precisely FUCK ALL to an SS win.  Here is what i propose you do with all your feels the next time you get butthurt...  go lead something competently... something that will upskill my zerg FOR ME... seeing as how i obviously lack the skill.   And that goes for the rest of the hyperventillating neckbeards that have been triggerd by these truths, busily taking offense and preparing their downvote armadas... stop wasting your fucking energy hating and ACTUALLY lead something EXEMPLARY yourselves!  God forbid you actually do something productive for the server and resurrect this shithole of a place into something memorable / mentionable once again...  final thought:-  Just like in real life, if you dont fucking like it... CHANGE IT YOURSELF or STFU and vote for idiots like Tony Abbott."

Briggs,3d8ybv,Spiritrax,5,Tue Jul 14 17:17:26 2015 UTC,"lawl wut. Those pics are meaningless without context.  This alert started the new continent with NC and TR double teaming the VS, and then the VS forming up and using command chat to orchestrate a severe beat-down of the NC and then the TR to take everything back and then some, and then defend what we had and mitigate our loses as best we could to run down the clock and come out ahead. There was some zerging, some ghost capping, and some awesome fights, all of which was necessary to win the alert.  You want to know why we keep losing SS? Because of shitty mobilisation of troops, troops not working as proper squads, and questionable gameplans. Zerging on live incorporates all of those things but at the end of the day when two factions are busy fighting each other the third is going to zerg until the other two either wrap up their farms or have no choice but to switch their attention to the third - you can't really blame one faction for it when the other two just won't fight them, and like I said your pictures are meaningless when it comes to working out the how and why of those bases in the context of the alerts.  And seriously, you're bitching about what Unbless was doing when there were multiple continents unlocked? Do you realise that for the most part the VS had overpop during a lot of that as for whatever reason VS accounts seemed to have a better chance of logging in? If he hadn't of been there farming up the certs, then that would have been more people for the VS to zerg with."

Is it to better the community through: competition, socially, representation? Looking at those 3 reason on what point you may want to improve on for the community, you have not demonstrated anything that will better either game play or ourselves. I see this thread as changing the community to better yourself, then better all of us.  Your shifting the blame onto 0MY because off what reason? I sense his salt. it is strong.

Every other server has the a similar use of cheese, including numbers to win fights. What Briggs has to realise is that if we don't use what the other servers haven't got - a tight knit community - to enact changes to improve Live based play so skills increase overall , we will lose out to other servers because of lack of pop. The high veterancy rate and the improved quality of play due to that isn't enough to beat the likes of Emerald.  Having said that, if the NC and TR were not playing at farms on the NC/TR front, the VS would lose territory by zerging overall. Same with NC zergs. If the zerging faction is overpop the other two factions should stop playing at a farm and fight the overpop faction more.   99% of the NC overpops were R18   Faction pops were balanced before R18 came(sure each faction has had their overpop times, but each faction had a turn) NC didn't zerg much either, and it seemed there were smaller outfits popping up with goals based around skill.  They should return to Connery, and realise the reason no one joined them on Connery was purely their personality - Briggs players didn't go around defaming them giving them a blank slate on Connery.   TCFB.   I'm pretty sure TCFB has less than a squad primetime, given their size and the loss of vets in recent times."

The main thing is that it needs to be a publicly accessible vote, but we are allowed to limit it to outfit representatives.  The voting will be open over a couple of days, possibly a week depending on time constraints. But I'm not going to be chasing people down to vote, so in that sense it will be 66% of outfits that can be bothered to vote.  I think at this point we pretty much already have all of the outfits that want to participate and that we can trust to look after the accounts, but there might be one or two in the woodwork still which is why I posted this here.

Briggs,3d2ys5,SlingingNumber4,5,Mon Jul 13 02:45:28 2015 UTC,"1st encounter you shot at a guy who didn't know you were there without enough time to kill him before he's behind cover, you also didn't spot him to track him on minimap. Without luck and enemy incompetence that could have gone a lot worse.  You reload with 75 bullets in mag.  Your sensitivity is ridic high, even after the changes you mention ITT. Aim for 10cm/360 hip and 20cm/360 ads which is still high. Without top-tier natural aim and mouse control you're gimping yourself hard at such high sens - keep in mind whenever you see these type of numbers that all you'll need really is to do at most 180 and yours is still 2 centimeters, a tiny amount of space, for such a large movement. This is the biggest problem honestly, changing it will feel awkward but it does help a lot - even for people with top-tier natural aim and mouse control.  Some of the time you're going around with your crosshair on the ground and only move your crosshair around the corner when you're around it. Keep your crosshair at upper chest level all the time to make it a habit and when moving around 'pre-aim' with your crosshair when going around corners if that makes sense. More useful in bigger fights with people everywhere. Do this and a lot of the time you've done half the aiming in a fight before you knew it was ever going to happen.  Clips of you in bigger fights would be better"
Briggs,3d2ys5,nyzekk,4,Mon Jul 13 03:58:44 2015 UTC,"My main critique is that you kept on switching to medkit for no reason.  I sort of understand why you switched to medkit when you first spawned, so that you could ""cheese"" your Kills Per Hour with your LMG Stat.  But you should have switched back to LMG just before you spawned your Flash, as it put you at a disadvantage when you bailed from it as you still had your Medkit in hand.  And while you were at the enemy base you kept on switching to your Medkit for no reason (unless you're one of the few people that mistakenly think that it makes you move faster), which nearly got you killed at 1:22."
Briggs,3d2ys5,1WAVE1,3,Mon Jul 13 05:20:41 2015 UTC,Force of habit I would say. I also prefer to have a less obscured vision when it's not needed. I definitely don't think it makes me run faster :P
Briggs,3d2ys5,1WAVE1,2,Mon Jul 13 05:26:35 2015 UTC,"That's more understandable :)  But it's still a bit of a risk running around with medkit in hand, as it does take a while to switch back to your LMG when you need it in a hurry.  Also if you're having issues with obscured vision you might want to try changing your UserOptions.ini to VerticalFOV=100 and see if that helps. :)"
Briggs,3d2ys5,coolfire1080P,0,Mon Jul 13 05:35:27 2015 UTC,"Kidding? he doesn't medkit enough in my opinion, keaves him self vulnerable a bit."
Briggs,3d2ys5,Wenzington,3,Mon Jul 13 07:00:16 2015 UTC,You seem very twitchy squirrel. What's your sensitivity in cm hip and aimed?
Briggs,3d2ys5,Wenzington,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:20:53 2015 UTC,Used to be a 1.54cm hipfire 360 (2x that for ADS) but I've downgraded it since coming back.   Now it's ~4cm Hipfire and 8.5cm ADS
Briggs,3d2ys5,Ridiculisk1,2,Mon Jul 13 03:35:50 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest changing your sensitivity. 20cm+ hip with greater ads is pretty common.  I personally started similarly to you, with huge improvements when I changed sensitivities. I suggest you watch this. Really helped me when I transitioned from air to ground.   I'm now at 35cm hip 40ish ads. It's something you need to fuck with for months up and down til you find the sweet spot. Don't limit yourself with your comfort zone, the greatest improvements come with initial substantial changes. From there its fine tuning."
Briggs,3d2ys5,coolfire1080P,2,Mon Jul 13 04:10:01 2015 UTC,Jesus christ that's insanely high. I run about a 30cm/360 and even that's still a bit higher than I want it. Your life will be a whole lot easier if you drop it a bit.
Briggs,3d2ys5,er1992,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:10:07 2015 UTC,"Wow, that hurts jsut thinking about that. But keep in mind my 360 to turn (both scoped and hip) is 95 cm.   I personally think that your 360 should be a little less then twice the width of your mouse pad, as performing a 360 in game is quite unnecesary, and a 180 quite needed, so being able to perform a 180 with a little room left over in one swing of the mouse pad is great."
Briggs,3d2ys5,UnnamedSG,5,Mon Jul 13 06:59:20 2015 UTC,"Oh fucking hell. I don't even know where to start.

Briggs,3d2ys5,DerpyNerdy,2,Mon Jul 13 05:46:54 2015 UTC,"from watching that very short clip that didnt really tell much, all I can really think is that you have your sensitivity to high, lowering it will help with following targets and handling recoil  other than that the only minor thing i can say is that shooting a guy in the back without being able to kill him or make sure he dies is generally a big no no, as it tells them where you are, and lets them get the drop on you"
Briggs,3d2ys5,CaptainLaserFace,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:24:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks. My thinking in tiny fights like that is to not worry too much about giving away my positioning, since I rarely get punished for it and kills are quite valuable in terms of enemy inaction."
Briggs,3d2ys5,s9ilent,2,Mon Jul 13 03:38:01 2015 UTC,"You can run a high sense if you like man, I like mine around 3.5 cm. Just relax when your aiming and think about predicting your target instead of training on them."

Briggs,3d2ys5,crushdepth5thFaction,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:36:09 2015 UTC,"Okay, firstly, you ran out the back of a spawnroom that's not yours. You got lucky by not getting shot, but don't do it in future, you're needlessly exposing yourself to potential firing lines.   First guy you shot at when you were standing on that box (0:52). I personally wouldn't have shot at him, as I wouldn't be able to secure a kill. Luckily it worked out for you though and he came back around the shipping crate and you finished him off.   When you killed the pistol heavy and barely won, you didn't burst fire and your movement was twitchy. Seems that your sensitivity may be a touch too high. What's your mouse DPI and in game senstivity?   Next kill was good. You heard the callout and got some nice headshots.  Same with the next one. Good shooting = dead planetmans  Looks like you got killed because of the crouch the other player did. Threw your aim off and he/she got the kill. Not much you can do about that, except try and react quicker, but due to latency it's nigh on impossible."

I don't even think it'd be possible on Briggs with the current population?  I'd try this, but it seems like the most silly meta ever, given that participants run the risk of being hardware banned. I say this because apparently the system works different depending on the age of the account. What people have been saying on the main thread is accounts that have BR100's on them apparently get 'locked' whilst they're reviewed and straight up new ones are just permanently banned.  On a final note, people are reporting hardware bans on the main thread now.  TL;DR: I wouldn't risk it but hey, good luck to anyone who's bold and interested enough to give it a go!

Have you tried swapping the microphone device in settings between system default and whatever your Mic is called? No technical reason but I've found it sometimes helps.   Otherwise I'd jump on a ts and check whether it's your Mic or ps2's notoriously bad voice system.  Odds are its the latter.

I prefer the extra control I have by having to hold down the button.  Nigh on impossible for me. Can't stand it.  Depends on the gun and CoF bloom. Low recoil/low bloom guns like the NS15-M can go up to 10-13 shots without much problem, but for the majority of guns, it's closer to 3-5. I always try to burst the exact amount of shots needed to kill people with headshots though. (so 3 shots for 200/167 weapons, 4 for 143).  Anything where I'm not within kissing distance of the enemy.  If the guy falls over dead, I'll stop."
Briggs,3d2s9b,Ridiculisk1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:04:07 2015 UTC,"basically this, id only expand on 5 by saying that you generally want to find the range where a weapon starts to become inaccurate, requiring burst firing or if it has a lot of horizontal bloom"
Briggs,3d2s9b,diamondwing,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:23:32 2015 UTC,"low bloom guns   The NS-15M's bloom per shot is identical to the Orion or CARV, those 10-13 bullets just come out more quickly."
Briggs,3d2s9b,Adamarr,2,Mon Jul 13 03:13:21 2015 UTC,"VR training will tell you how many shots per burst at various ranges, with your current weapon. At 5m with a GD22, if you know that enemy max is nearly dead and he's trying to plug someone else with bursters (lol) then a good sized burst is half a mag. Trying to hit infils at render range, a good burst is a single shot.   You've gotta figure out how many shots you can hold reliably in the upper chest/head killzone before lifting at any given range, and that is your burst size. An NS11a doesn't give a damn about bloom until you're on shot 10 or so, but an Anchor will bloom fast and hard in under 5 shots.  When bursting it is important not to make your bursts too close, or you might not get the COF reduction, it's kind of like ""oversampling"" a scout rifle. You gotta ride that line between accuracy & dps."
Briggs,3d2s9b,Shepherd336,4,Mon Jul 13 02:47:50 2015 UTC,"Toggling is pure preference man. There's no real performance relationship there, just go with whatever is most comfortable for you.  Swapping up from non toggle to toggle or vice versa is annoying as shit because in my case it's a habit that's been ingrained over 20 years of fps gaming.   Burst firing in the literal are 2 or 3 round bursts as selected on the weapons fire selector. Burst firing in the general sense is just using short controlled bursts when firing on your target so as to keep your COF and bloom minimal and keep rounds tightly grouped. A burst can be anything from 2 to 10 rounds depending on the weapon, the range etc.   Situation to burst in; Nearly all of them. Keeping your weapon under control wins fights. Missing shots loses fights. QED.   When not burst firing (ie, point blank ""you cannot possible miss"" range); Do not stop shooting till your target is dead or circumstances change to such that you must retreat to cover otherwise you will be dead."

Semi autos? Yes. Automatic weapons? Yes. There is no golden shortcut to knowing how many shots or seconds for cof, or for ded. This is practice, and memory, nothing less. That is learning fps gun mechanics at their simplest. Practice can be the virtual, to learn patterns, reload etc. or in combat, either works. No lazy allowed. Practice. Each gun has a different feel. The only thing is to be aware of your gun and pay attention to what effect different actions have, this is the difference between practice and just playing.  Don't over think. Watch other players. Practice"
Briggs,3d2s9b,BUnit3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:37:32 2015 UTC,"Probably go have a play around in VR with your favourite weapons to get a feel for how long you should burst fire each weapon. This will give you a feel for how long you can keep holding the trigger for the varying engagement ranges. It's something that comes with time and practice. Trying to count shots is too hard, get a feel for the time with mouse button pressed, and how quickly you can go back to pressing it again and still keep good aim.  I sometimes find it hard after I have taken a break from PS2 and jump straight back in with say the gauss saw for example, but fortunately it doesn't take long to get the feel for a practiced weapon back."

I'm guessing you ran into TAW8 being led by Noc at each fight you went to, as he's a fan of the fury battlebus.  VS had 50% of the territory and 42% of the population by the end of the alert. For the first hour of the alert we went from 35% to 45% of the territory with 33% of the population. We then held on to that territory for the rest of the alert whilst TR and NC tried to take it back, whilst leaving each other alone until the last twenty minutes.  VS command comms ftw."

Briggs,3d0nqy,Vaelkyri,3,Mon Jul 13 07:23:29 2015 UTC,"LA and infil are by far the easiest to go for. LA is literally just kills, whereas infil is kills (and possibly recon). If you've played support a lot in the past, I hear that medic isn't too hard. Engy isn't too difficult (except for that bitch turret aurax) and auraxing stickies is a lot of fun. Heavy's a bitch unless you've already auraxed the ES heavy weapon and/or AV nades (air deterrence lol).   Objectives is just something that you'll earn over time, so there's no real point grinding it out (except for sundy kills and objective support ribbons).   My favourite directive reward would be by far the battlegoose. Of course, the grind to get there wasn't exactly pleasant, as the vanu LMG arsenal is fairly lackluster outside of the 2 standouts. Carbine isn't really worth it. SMG isn't really worth it (never buy the MKV ever)."
Briggs,3d0nqy,ChillyPhilly27,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:29:02 2015 UTC,"The downside to the medic one is shield ribbons. I overcame this one by only using the shield thingy for biolab assaults. Go through teleporter, put shield thingy down, heal and rez people without going outside, get ribbons. It was easily done in no time. The other good spot is in a big fight when you are defending a tower. Put one down right in the main exit door that leaves the lower section of the spawn room."

Enemy LA kills is easy, kills are easy, carbine, smg and shotgun kills are easy. Boom, done.   Most rewarding would be one that unlocks a directive weapon worth using, so TR ARs, NC or VS LMGs."
Briggs,3d0nqy,Ridiculisk1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:05:39 2015 UTC,"so TR ARs   Is the T1A Unity worth it? Of all the directives, I think the Assault Rifle one would be the easiest for me since I enjoy playing as a Medic but I've heard mixed opinions about it's effectiveness."
Briggs,3d0nqy,Ilandar,2,Mon Jul 13 06:53:04 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's alright. It's basically a cycler with a grip and SPA. Seeing as I always use a grip with the cycler, the unity is a direct upgrade.   Some people like it, others don't, but it is a direct upgrade over the cycler. If you want to try it out, head to the PTS, you can unlock the directive weapons for 1 cert over there and test them to your heart's content."

Easiest: Leadership - it's literally other people doing the work for you. Of course, if you're not a good leader they won't follow you, so there's that to consider. Plus it can be frustrating to heard pubs.  Most rewarding: Leadership - you can be one of the 150 or so people on all of the PS2 servers who gets to wear a shiny hat. More importantly, you learn the RTS side of the game that few people seem to know, plus more, and you make friends with a whole bunch of people you wouldn't otherwise interact with.  Though from a purely visual point of view, C4 aurax is awesome."

Briggs,3d0nqy,DerpyNerdy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:42:22 2015 UTC,Easiest for me was the Light assault one.   most rewarding I guess was C4 auraxium since its the explosion is so pretty :3.  of course whats easy for you and most rewarding for you will depend on what classes you play or vehicles you mainly drive.
Briggs,3d0nqy,mblades,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:52:00 2015 UTC,Most easiest would be LA or Infiltrator.  Most rewarding? Depends....

Briggs,3d0nqy,crushdepth5thFaction,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:10:27 2015 UTC,"Best - Explosives.  Easiest - LA or medic.  Worst - Engineer because you have to auraxium a turret. I was hoping the Archer would be an alternative, but nope, they put that in the sniper rifle directive.  Edit: It would have been fun to start the directives from scratch, rather than be given a heap of new weapons when they first came out, and then feel like I'm grinding for kills that I have done thousands of times before to do the infantry ones. Hopefully it's something that has enhanced new player experience."

Briggs,3czvdp,hmjet,4,Sun Jul 12 07:56:21 2015 UTC,"Just going to post what I posted in a thread similar to this about ~6 months ago.   Most 'gaming' headsets are utter horseshit, speaking from experience. If you want a good headset for a (relatively) small pricepoint, I would highly recommend the AudioTechnica AD-700X's. I bought a pair about 6 months ago and haven't looked back. The soundstage is excellent, especially for Planetside, and FPS games in general, although it lacks bass (and when I say 'lacks', I mean it's almost entirely devoid of), which may be a bit of a game-breaker for you, depending on if you intend on using them for things that require a lot, or really any bass. If you need a mic to go with it, I would also highly suggest the Zalman. It's cheap and effective, although, do be warned that you will definitely need to turn the microphone boost right the way up when you put it on your headset wire, otherwise it will be extremely quiet; barely audible, even."
Briggs,3czvdp,Keilos,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:45:29 2015 UTC,This post. Bought on recommendation and never been happier with a headset (I have used about a douzen during my gaming life) that coupled with a yeti pro and I am sounding and hearing awsome though some minor issues with mechanical keyboard and voice activation. Bass has been no issue for me as I use for pure gaming and saves the ears during long sessions. Thanks again Kelios

Briggs,3czvdp,Sen7ryGun,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:31:38 2015 UTC,i m looking into this aswell really trying to decide what to get any thoughts on headsets?
Briggs,3czvdp,Sen7ryGun,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:25:25 2015 UTC,"It really depends on your price range man. The sky is the limit, but generally speaking for the price you'd pay for a dedicated gaming headset you can get yourself a set of higher quality headphones and a stand alone mic for a similar price.  My first question would be what kind of sound setup does your PC have at the moment? If you're not running a dedicated sound card (internal or external) then you've most likely got AC97 or whatever the modern equivalent is, which isn't too bad. From there it's just a case of checking out a few reviews and price matching a set of headphones and a stand alone mic rather than looking purely at a combo/gaming headset."
Briggs,3czvdp,Sen7ryGun,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:42:42 2015 UTC,i'm looking around the $200 mark! but lets see your thoughts :P
Briggs,3czvdp,EidolonicVS,3,Sun Jul 12 11:18:02 2015 UTC,"Here's a mic: http://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=116_250&products_id=31868  As long as everyone can hear you and understand you, the mic doesn't matter. Spend your cash on the headphones, that's the part that you get to enjoy.  Generally speaking, for the $200 range the Audio-Technica ATH-M50 are pretty much the best you'll do. They're well built and basically the industry standard against which most other headphones are benchmarked against. Excellent sound quality, for the price. The only down side that's ever noted about the things is that they're so commonly used for on the move use that they would have been nice with a built in mic.  The Sony MDR-V6 headphones are also pretty nice. Another old headphone design (30 years old) that hasn't changed much and is still incredibly reliable. Much like the M50's, the only gripe people tend to have about these headphones are that they're quite light weight and can feel fragile. Never read anything about them breaking though.  Either of these headphones will pretty much destroy whatever gaming headsets are out there in terms of sound quality, and in most cases are significantly cheaper than recommended gaming headsets also (Astro A40's ~$230AUD, A50's up to $380AUD, Razer Tiamet 7.1 $299AUD, Sennheiser G4ME zero $279AUD).  If it's at all possible, go out and actually try these headphones out with some sound. The Sony range provide really rich deep sound and the Audio-Technica M50's have got solid bass that's quite snappy as well (goes great with gunfire). Whatever you choose though, just let your ears be the judge. Talk to some retailers and ask them for a decent sound demo, take a piece of recorded audio on your phone to plug them into and have a listen to and really put them through a test. Some sound with explosions, gunfire, car chases, helicopters and shit."
Briggs,3czvdp,MerlinGaines,3,Sun Jul 12 11:59:27 2015 UTC,"That's a decent budget that'll give you lots of options.  Couple a $150 pair of headphones with either an Ant Lion Modmic (USD40 + shipping, sorry I have no idea what things cost in Oz anymore) or a Zalman Zm-Mic1 (USD10, cheap, not as good, but perfectly serviceable).  There is a budget headphone option to look at if you want to save a bit of money- lots of people (myself included) are happy with the Samon SR850/Superlux 668b, they're about $50 but perform far beyond their price range. I was clued in on these by an audio engineer friend who thinks that you have to spend >150 to get anything noticeably better. Edit: They're not super bass heavy though, if you're in to that kind of thing.  This stuff is available on Amazon. I have no idea who carries it in Oz.  I've deliberately avoided developing audiophile tendencies because you can spend waaay too much in that area (refuse to buy anything fancier than low end Grado and Linn stuff).  Echoing several other posts: Gaming headsets are probably the last peripheral holdout where companies sell low quality shit for too much money by slapping the word ""gaming"" on a box. Stick with companies that actually make sound gear for a living."
Briggs,3czvdp,EidolonicVS,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:01:49 2015 UTC,"Most popular recommendation at that price these days is probably the Audio Technica M50x. The AD range is also well regarded, but as Keilos' post mentions, they're pretty light on bass. Would recommend checking Headphonic (free shipping + solid range) unless you plan on buying from overseas, but shipping costs usually make that option less worthwhile.   Biggest pro for dedicated headphones is that they'll last a ridiculously long time if you treat them reasonably. Most 'gaming' headsets die/develop faults quickly in comparison"

Briggs,3czkpz,RichiesGhost,7,Sun Jul 12 05:25:28 2015 UTC,"Never ever jump unless you bloody have to. Bloom recovery is too slow coming off a jump. You will lose.  Do you have a .75 ADS weapon or a hipfire weapon? Does your weapon suffer an accuracy penalty for movement? These are the major deciding factors in whether or not to crouch or ADAD.  Crouching is a gamble. The effectiveness is going to depend on if they have a head or body bias. You might be crouching into a situation that lines the other dude up for head-shots against you.  ADAD is less of a gamble, as the often dubious network quality means you will almost always fly across their screen in a fashion that makes it very difficult for an opponent to track.  Always mix your As and Ds. If you are on a predictable velocity you might as well be stationary."
Briggs,3czkpz,UltraKillex,5,Sun Jul 12 05:42:04 2015 UTC,"I don't crouch because it is too difficult for me especially with the intense key binding set I already use. In conjunction with this, my aim is pretty shocking as I do too much with my mouse hand. My aim tendency is to the chest letting recoil guide my shots to the head eventually. I have found that when versing good players who crouch, I indirectly end up shooting them in the face as I intended to aim at the chest and get a nice headshot kill :) . I guess crouch would be good to do against players who aim for the head :)  I often just crouch behind boxes etc and peek above to pick off people. Its also my push to talk key so I indirectly crouch/lower altitude a lot :P"

If the person is bad I won't, because they'll just be chest or dick shotting and I'll just give them a free headshot.  See above point. Works in some cases.  Never. Not going to sacrifice ADS capability and hipfire CoF for a jump.  Terrible except at extreme CQC. (like <1m).  I try to alternate but tend to dddddd more.  Way better. Less predictable = more missed enemy shots."
Briggs,3czkpz,Ilandar,3,Sun Jul 12 05:35:18 2015 UTC,"I crouch against CQC Snipers or if I am surprised at close range. Sometimes I'll do it if I have cover directly in front of me, then pop up a second later when they stop firing.  I tend to jump around quite a bit, though not while I'm firing. It's a bad habit that has carried over from PvP in other MMOs. If I'm at the top of some stairs, sometimes I'll jump over the head of an enemy on the lower part of the stairs and do a 180 mid-air so I'm facing them when I land. It doesn't work much but it feels badass."
Briggs,3czkpz,Adamarr,3,Sun Jul 12 06:00:55 2015 UTC,"Seen a lot of people crouch spamming at close range lately, it shits me. So I guess it's at least a little effective."
Briggs,3czkpz,Balthizaur,4,Sun Jul 12 06:20:36 2015 UTC,I wish you could see armies being trained in techniques used online for FPS' such as bunny sniping 360 no scopers and adadad spamming rocket primary users.
Briggs,3czkpz,XCVJoRDANXCV,2,Sun Jul 12 09:43:35 2015 UTC,"How effective do you think jumping is?   Considering it ether fucks your CoF or forces you to stop shooting to allow it to rest It's not something I'd recommend doing.   What situations do you crouch in (i.e. close, medium, long range) and how often do you do it?   Close to mid range normally against high level players. It throws off their aim and they'll generally switch to body shots after you do it. As a Saw fan, I probably do it more than I should and it is not something I'd recommend in mid range fights.   Do you adadad or more aaaaaaa or dddddd?   Personally? dddddddd/aaaaaaa spam at mid range with adada spam when hip firing. These are both things I don't do enough (Again, Saw habits).    How effective do you think adadad is compared to aaaaaaa or dddddd?   Both are very effective provided they're being done in the right situation. Your goal in doing both is to attempt to increase your TTK By making you harder to hit. Both are very effective against high level players and make ""Dem dank headshots"" very difficult. The downside to ADADAD is that your central hit box doesn't really change all that much unless your rapidly moving and it relies on making random movments suddenly so I generally use it when hip firing. Single direction spam is good for moving your whole hit box slightly out of the way forcing them to adjust their aim which in CqC conditions takes less time than ADAD'ing."
Briggs,3czkpz,SanguinaryXII,2,Sun Jul 12 06:12:32 2015 UTC,"I probably find myself crouching too much, it's always annoying to over-estimate someone or try and throw someone off, only to duck-into headshots.   Situations to use it: to throw off the aim of someone who aims high, potential uses depending on terrain/elevation. Random crouches if expecting in-coming sniper fire. Possibly to utilize cover and then re-engage. Mostly close/mid, possibly crouch for longer-range engagement for accuracy purposes.   Debatable, and hard to quantify. It's possible to use crouch to help reset CoF for some things. I'd say it's worth it against snipers and people who you know consistently aim for the head.   Jumping in general is bad for accuracy. Jump a corner/doorway to throw out an opponents' aim/provide element of surprise/take advantage of low sensitivity players. Jump while using medkits or while evading can be useful.   Circumstantial, do it at the wrong time and you're fucked.   Bit of both, try not to repeat the same pattern too much. If you don't move far enough to either side, you're not making them change their aim much, and you're relying on warping/shitty netcode.   Fuck, I dunno. I'd say a mixture of the two is good, the whole idea is to make it harder for your enemy to hit you, whilst you also suffer from a moving accuracy penalty. Obviously works best with hipfire weapons/0.75 ADS/weapons with good moving CoF.   I think I recall BIR saying he'd rarely crouch unless he knew the person he was against was avid with headshots. There's also a knack to it, as while crouching/standing back up, it throw your aim a bit."
Briggs,3czkpz,Sen7ryGun,3,Sun Jul 12 15:26:30 2015 UTC,"A little bit of ADAD crouch action goes a long way. It's good because for headshot inclined players, it throws off their accuracy for half a second and buying time wins fights."

Briggs,3czkpz,Sen7ryGun,2,Sun Jul 12 07:05:31 2015 UTC,"crouch is bound to alt for me, since its my thumb rest position.    just crouch when you think he's just reset his CoF so you throw off his aim while his CoF blooms into nothingness."
Briggs,3czkpz,immaNeenja,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:04:34 2015 UTC,"The point of the random crouch is to actively avoid creating muscle memory and to disrupt the muscle memory or your enemy.   It's a bit of a wild card move and may sometimes work to your disadvantage. As has been stated elsewhere in this thread, if the player shooting you uses a centre of mass bias, you may be setting yourself up for crouching right into a volley of headshots.   It creates a bit more ivi meta as some people have a natural tendency for head shots and as you learn who goes for the head and who goes for centre of mass you learn where it's appropriate to throw in a random crouch in an ivi."
Briggs,3czkpz,crushdepth5thFaction,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:12:22 2015 UTC,"good way to check is to not crouch until you sense you're not completely wrecking him in the damage race - any center of mass aimer will be at 0hp while you still haven't lost your personal shields yet, so if you both are on par in terms of the damage race, he's a headshotter.    this is assuming you're a good headshotter, though."

If I'm in serious mode and/or I know my meagre capacity to make a personal contribution to the deaths of enemy infantry will make a difference, I simply avoid head on engagements as much as possible, and win via surprise. Being a heavy may change that depending on confidence at that moment."

Work on your communication. When I say 'communication', I mean what you're calling specific areas of the map you're playing on (having a relatively detailed knowledge of the actual map you'll be playing on helps immensely in this regard, but I'll touch on that later), making sure everyone understands and utilises those terms, etc. This also includes minimising the amount of 'clutter' you have; Picard doing his usual platoon-level commanding voice where he is effectively the only one providing information for a solid ~10+ second period didn't appear to be helping in that regard. In a competitive environment, at least in terms of communication, it's important to remember that you really only want things that are absolutely relevant to your entire team (cannot stress the 'entire' part enough) being said. Also, I'd like to stress the importance of people being willing to speak up; it rarely seemed that anyone outside of maybe ~3-4 people were providing information regularly, the most vocal (of course) being Picard. Try and make sure that everyone is on a level playing field; it makes playing and communicating in more intense competitive environments significantly more fluid, from my experience. (To clarify: that doesn't mean you shouldn't have someone who's calling the shots, it just means that people should feel that they have the ability to communicate, should they feel the need). Squad composition is really important. I wasn't really able to see specifically what you guys were running in terms of squad comp., but it seemed to me that you had a few too many LAs (less is more; if you have someone who is good at it, get them and only them to do it), and Medics, which could have been just as easily replaced with HAs. The fact is, if you want to get anywhere in a competitive environment in terms of pushing objectives, you need to have a solid base of HP behind you to make sure you reach the point and have a relatively solid hold on it. Again, map knowledge comes into this somewhat, but the fact is that you should be prioritising Heavies over everything else in terms of how you make up your squads; minimise your support class usage. Map knowledge. I literally cannot stress this point hard enough. It is, by far the most essential component to doing well in a small-scale competitive environment in this game. Pale Canyon is a difficult map (it's also my personal favourite, along with many other who played on it during Farmers); it's second hardest of all the Farmers maps, bested by only Ghanan. It requires you to know the ins and outs of all the areas you can be flanked from (and carry out flanking on) when spawning on both sides, where you're able to utilise wall-jumping, what areas are good for use as holding points, what areas are inherently weak points in another teams defences, when those weaknesses can and should be exploited, etc. Essentially, this point comes down to making sure that you, and your entire team understand the map, on a deeper level than simply knowing where a doorway is. We're talking more along the lines of knowing where a doorway is, what areas/walljumps can be moved through/used to reach that doorway, where people may be hiding as they recover shields, etc.    I will say one thing, though - you guys, as a team, have improved significantly since we scrimmed you. You weren't put in the fairest of matches today, as RSNC already have a relatively solid standing knowledge of the way Pale Canyon plays out thanks to their experience within Farmers, so I think you pumped out a solid performance, given the circumstances.  Finally, I'd like to recommend (take this as you will) that you guys sit down and analyse what you did wrong in this match, and what you can work on for future matches. It's what we did after having our asses handed to us by AC in the first week of Season 2 of US Farmers, and it helped a lot; make sure you're honest with yourselves about what you did wrong, what you can do better, etc. Also, it can help to watch demos of other teams. Here are some of the demos of us playing (mostly in US) Farmers matches and practices. We never did things perfectly, but we learnt out of each ass-whooping we got, much as I should expect the guys that played for you today will.  EDIT: This one in particular demonstrates relatively sound communication, bar my stuttering.  EDIT 2: I think Solus also has a few laying around that I may be able to get him to dig up if you're interested.  That's about all I've got, and it's not exactly coherent. If you have any questions, feel free to throw them at me."

Briggs,3cw9wk,immaNeenja,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:02:39 2015 UTC,Idk im very dependent on sound to get reliable 1taps or prefires to be accurate since you can track targets extremely precisely with sound.

When it comes to the day no nerves cause why would you when you are vsing people who should not even be worthy enough to play in the same game as you. I do not mean be counts to other teams just within your own ts. Your confidence and cockyness will help with teammates nerves as well. At the same time be aware of your shortcomings and what you need to improve on just never share it. You will never see a professional team who are humble outside of the spotlight.

Briggs,3cw9wk,Yoddd,2,Sat Jul 11 11:44:47 2015 UTC,"As per what keilos and yodd said, there is a very glaring lack of small-scale tactical awareness, be it communication style, map flow awareness or team coherence.    I have not played PS2 competitively, but I'm lem/le in cs and i pug a lot with friends - if anything, it has taught me that these three factors I mentioned above are of utmost importance in any small scale competitive setting where individual actions can greatly influence the outcome of the round/half/match.    So, take it with a pinch of salt, but:    Work on your callouts. Very specific, short names commonly understood amongst the team for every GTI/spot on the map. Everyone should be familiar.    Short sharp comms. Listening distracts, but crucial information is good to have. Say it quick. Less is more. Only what your team needs to know to do their job - ""killed their sniper peeking along highway!"" is too much, ""highway awp dead"" is enough, for example.    As for map flow, keilos said it well, and he has the game-specific experience to back it up.    Finally, team coherence: it builds naturally over time but can be expedited. Know how each of your buddies play, their usual roles in a strat, their weaknesses and strengths - you wouldnt ask a weak aimer to peek first (entry), you wouldn't waste your strongest aimer to set up the grenades and watch flanks. While this can be preplanned, be ready to know these nuances by heart so when the strat caller calls for a quick switchup each member automatically roughly knows who will be doing what even if its the first time you're executing such a strat.    GLHF!"

Briggs,3cpi56,TurtleYo,2,Fri Jul 10 05:34:32 2015 UTC,"Based on timezones I think it would have been 10pm when it started for us and I had work in the morning. Not something I can be a part of sadly, lol."
Briggs,3cpi56,PeRXeRs,2,Fri Jul 10 07:06:22 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. It only takes 30-45 minutes, maybe you will find your way in one of the future exercises. :)"
Briggs,3cp60x,PeRXeRs,8,Thu Jul 9 17:30:20 2015 UTC,"Definitely going to be needing an organised opposing force otherwise we're going to be lured into a false sense of security. Then when we go up against someone half organised we gon git #rekt. Might be an idea to organise those dates by having a similar style of force commanding on the other two factions (like I see you're already trying to do). Facing unorganised pubs doesn't really help us as a server.  Edit: not trying to be negative, just seeing if we can get organised as a server, not just a faction."
Briggs,3cp60x,PuckerMyAnus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:56:44 2015 UTC,"Throwing everything we have as a server (in terms of organised players) onto one faction for an hour a week will not be enough to develop the cohesion you are looking for.  Here is what i propose as a realistic training regime.   EVERY prime time alert 6-9pm (or as often as you can make it) FC jumps on the faction with the lowest pop Outfits on the lowest pop faction co-ordinate under your command against the odds in order to ""git gudder"" Profit   IMO this is STILL a vastly inferior training model to the daily gameplay commanders get on higher pop servers. It's not an unrealistic expectation to train daily for a competitive event AND it will help you get outfits addressing their weaknesses when you've seen them in the field."

I think you missunderstood the system. All Outfits will stay on their main faction - there will be no faction change. Only my own Outfit will bring their numbers (1-2 Squads) to the faction I command, if this faction got a noticable underpop."
Briggs,3cp60x,swaghawk,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:41:45 2015 UTC,"I personally think if this was to work we need a force on every faction. Like one of the earlier comments to this post states, all's we prove to ourselves is we can beat on pubs. To change this the only thing I can think of is a organised force on every faction.   Even with an underpoped faction, it'll teach the commander the importance of defending rather than assalting and teach the squad/plattoon leads how to hold the line when they're not given the forces they need to be an even/overwhelming population."

Briggs,3cp60x,pedrotski,2,Thu Jul 9 23:25:09 2015 UTC,Nothing specific has been organised as far as I'm aware. There hasn't been a great deal of true strategic cooperation on TR for a long while.

Perx is trying his best to turn Briggs back into the fighting machine that it was. This is his way to turn things around and as our community-voted Force Commander he has been given a mandate by our server to try what he feels is necessary to bring us back to greatness.  Perx, when you roll around to TR I'll be raising my hand for SOCA to support you. I'm confident the leadership of SOCA will agree with you. Our ops start at 6.30pm AEST Sunday night and go for two hours. Our primary focus is our members, of course.  Good luck mate."

No other Force Commanders have done this, and we won the first few just fine. And you jumping into command chat on other factions and telling people what to do will just cause more people to turn it off than have done already.

Briggs,3co5ni,heshtegded,9,Thu Jul 9 13:01:05 2015 UTC,Briggs airgame started dying when gank squads became regular occurences. Same way that every other servers air died just at a much slower rate.

Briggs,3co5ni,RichiesGhost,0,Fri Jul 10 02:56:12 2015 UTC,What did you expect you would come back to Briggs after a mass exodus of skyknights who couldn't handle their toys being broken?  Sympathy?
Briggs,3co5ni,crushdepth5thFaction,2,Thu Jul 9 16:11:41 2015 UTC,"see's VS is labelled cancer, has a lawl   .   GunR is trying to build up an air squad if anyone on VS is interested   Snake's not wrong Richie - you're not going to get good pilots by simply 'starting an air squad'. You have to find someone who can teach how to fly and get them to do so, mainly through 1v1s. I.e. you can't both hate skyknights and replace them."
Briggs,3co5ni,RichiesGhost,-3,Thu Jul 9 21:23:46 2015 UTC,"The thing is though, the air game isn't 1v1.  In a perfect world, aircraft would wait their turn, and engage fairly, but even during the height of Briggs air game, you had to constantly be on the lookout for enemy pilots who would engage in 2/3v1's.  As with the ground game, Planetside 2 is about combined arms and group tactics, not individual competition."
Briggs,3co5ni,crushdepth5thFaction,3,Fri Jul 10 00:38:58 2015 UTC,"In a perfect world, aircraft would wait their turn, and engage fairly   No - in a perfect world, there's always going to be groups of people ganking, whether it's ad hoc or planned. The difference between now and a perfect world is that there wouldn't be exponentially scalable lockon missiles for groups to equip that negate the need for pilot skill.  But that's besides the point. Richies labels the talented and practiced people who quit ""skyknights who couldn't handle their toys being broken"" (not that that even makes sense, since afterburners/nosegun has never been changed) , and in [this comment]{https://www.reddit.com/r/Briggs/comments/3co5ni/briggs_air_is_dead/csxivdm} pulls out the old accusation that they're to blame for keeping pilots out of the air game. But he also says he wants to get people flying, which is an admirable intention.  The issue I think is that Richies doesn't see the wood for all the trees - the fact that ace pilots are overwhelmingly eager to tutor new ones, the fact that people who use nosegun/afterburner and fly alone, practicing 1v1s, get much better (much faster) than the average lockon user/group ambusher (e.g. GORDO); these are all ignored in the face of prejudiced dislike of ""skyknights"".  If he wants to get people hooked on flying, to get a sharp airforce going, he can't do it through simply making an airsquad. Time and again outfits have tried the same thing and it always ends mediocrely.  Then you added the old meaningless rhetoric of   Planetside 2 is about combined arms and group tactics, not individual competition.   The groundgame and airgame are, as the names would suggest, totally different things and not worthy of comparison. Just because PS2 is advertised as for grand strategy you know as well as I do it's also a game of individuals and individual skill."
Briggs,3co5ni,RichiesGhost,2,Fri Jul 10 01:31:51 2015 UTC,Just because PS2 is advertised as for grand strategy you know as well as I do it's also a game of individuals and individual skill.   Have you tried Elite Dangerous? I hear that it's a game of individuals and individual skill.   It's onsale on steam at the moment.
Briggs,3co5ni,RichiesGhost,2,Fri Jul 10 06:30:12 2015 UTC,I've kept track of it. A lot of people say it's a shit grind so :/
Briggs,3co5ni,twistedrapier,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:21:34 2015 UTC,It's more of a who's got the bigger ship type of game unfortunately. PS2 air skillcap is much higher.
Briggs,3co5ni,twistedrapier,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:19:46 2015 UTC,I'm interested in it but the basics of the gameplay seem to be fetch missions and I'm pretty sure that I would get bored with that rather quickly.
Briggs,3co5ni,RichiesGhost,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:51:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah its disappointingly grindy. The trade aspect of the game is stuck in the 1980s, it hasn't changed at all."
Briggs,3co5ni,Ilandar,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:32:01 2015 UTC,"Richies labels the talented and practiced people who quit ""skyknights who couldn't handle their toys being broken"" (not that that even makes sense, since afterburners/nosegun has never been changed)   Would it make more sense if I said that many of the talented and practiced people who quit largely did so in response to Daybreak tweaking the flight controls a few months back, and that rather than sticking around to adapt to the changes and the somewhat leveled playing field they decided to label things broken and abandon the game?   and in this comment pulls out the old accusation that they're to blame for keeping pilots out of the air game   You can take it as an old accusation if you like but that wasn't my intention. My intention was more akin to the old axiom of 'you can't have your cake and eat it too' as in context of the comment you can't be killing a pilot a minute on a low population server and expect it to be a good environment for newer players to learn in, just like you can't claim the air game is dead if you're able to kill a pilot a minute on a low population server. Rather than being dead, the air-game has evolved. Lots of the talented and practiced people left the fly game and so in their absence the talented and practiced dog-fighting air game has died off, however like in any ecosystem where apex predators are removed it has given the chance for lesser predators to step up and evolve ways to take advantage of the empty niche.   Another way to put it is that the talented and practiced people had found the old flight system to be rewarding (as the pleasures of their successes increased the likelihood of their repeating the behavior of engaging in the air game) however they then found the changes to the flight controls to be punishing (as the changes decreased their pleasure and thus the likelihood of playing the air game). As a result of the talented and practiced absence from the air game, those who had found going up against the talented and practiced to be a punishing experience found themselves in an environment where the air-game could be more of a rewarding experience for them and, due to their lack of talents and practice, they followed the path of least resistance and maximum rewards which was ground pounding.   Going from psychology back to ecology, not all of the apex predators had left and so whilst there was an opportunity for the lesser predators to step up they still had to deal with some of the talented and practiced players. At that stage the air game was more rewarding for them and so they remained in the game longer, and in doing so they had the opportunity to develope strategies to combat the talented and practiced people in the form of lock-on gank squads. This basically gets us to where we are today, being that some of the talented and practiced people have returned to find that (surprise surprise) the dog-fighting air-game died after the talented and practiced people left, and that in their absence the untalented and unpracticed people have found a different way to play the air game which (boo hoo) isn't as rewarding for the talented and practiced people as it's either too easy or too hard for them.   The issue I think is that Richies doesn't see the wood for all the trees - the fact that ace pilots are overwhelmingly eager to tutor new ones   Just out of curiosity, how many of the 71 people you wrecked the other day received tutoring from you and in what form did it take?   these are all ignored in the face of prejudiced dislike of ""skyknights"".   I'm sorry, did me saying skyknights give you the impression that I'm prejudiced and that I dislike the talented and practiced people who fly in planetside? Is there a term that talented and practiced people who fly in planetside would prefer to be called?   If he wants to get people hooked on flying, to get a sharp airforce going, he can't do it through simply making an airsquad. Time and again outfits have tried the same thing and it always ends mediocrely.   You seem to know a lot about what GunR is trying to do. Could you tell me more about this air squad idea of ours?"
Briggs,3co5ni,Magikarpn,2,Fri Jul 10 06:16:16 2015 UTC,Please see my other apology for GunR specific flaming - I got pissed at you for a few comments and didn't keep it relevant.
Briggs,3co5ni,Project_Independence,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:29:53 2015 UTC,"All good.  Anger comes from getting the opposite of what we want. Given what happened with the flight changes and what you have returned to, I can understand where your anger might be coming from."
Briggs,3co5ni,Shepherd336,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:34:28 2015 UTC,"I'm confused.  You started this thread saying how the air game is dead because of group ganking, yet say that a perfect world would include those groups.  So you don't really have a problem with groups so much as lock on users right?  I do get where you're coming from about individual skill though.  It is important, I was just saying coordination will beat individual skill in this game 9 times out of 10.  Otherwise our elite players would never get beaten."
Briggs,3co5ni,equinub,2,Fri Jul 10 01:54:50 2015 UTC,".So you don't really have a problem with groups so much as lock on users right?   Yes—ganking has always and will always happen, and it's an oversimplification to ask that we have a server of 1v1s. Air hasn't died from just ganking. What has killed it is the introduction of lockons, which not only ruin 1v1s but more importantly turn a group of pilots into an impossible opponent, regardless of the skill level of the pilots in that group. People know this—lockons are more likely found amongst group fliers than solo pilots.  The conflict that arises is then: ""why bother becoming a 'skyknight' when lockons are the most powerful tool for A2A?"". Add on a little rhetoric about it being a team game and I think it becomes very easy to view those who complain about lockons as bitter aasholes. This kills the airgame."
Briggs,3co5ni,MadMaukh,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:30:56 2015 UTC,"You bring an interesting perspective to this if nothing else.  Every complaint I've ever heard from pilots about ""lockons"" was always about how G2A lockons were the cancer killing the air game.  While I could understand to a certain degree the angst about them, my sympathies disappeared very quickly after I observed a ridiculous amount of A2G ESFs farming infantry while armour fucks up their land forces.  The debate about A2A lockons seems a lot more straightforward, in that removing them all together would benefit the game considerably."
Briggs,3co5ni,Kitarix,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:19:41 2015 UTC,I'm not an A2G pilot but I don't think many people have real gripes with ground locks - it's just the A2A tomcats that are totally broken.
Briggs,3co5ni,pkisbest,0,Fri Jul 10 07:25:59 2015 UTC,The issue I think is that Richies doesn't see the wood for all the trees   I think the issue is that you're reading a shit load into my brief comments without asking for clarification.

The infantry game I can comfortably solo and enjoy it, air wise not so much.  We try to teach people the ropes but they won't last long as they need to break through that barrier. Once they're through that they go on to become 'better' pilots who know the basics of the air. Or they just go back to doing whatever they were doing before. The air is difficult to learn and takes time, something most people don't have I guess?  Most ground players haven't noticed either, hence why we're constantly told in BAM: ""Why don't you just get more pilots?""  Slinging's post tells you why! But yeah, the air has been dead for a while, happened a little while after you and various other pilots left the game. >:/"

There are also players who don't do stat traceable things that provide the support the best infantry players need to achieve their absolute best.

Jeez :/  The greatest strength of VS on Briggs is that we have a number of outfits whose active player base is about 6-12 people who play the game alot, leading to having about four or five skilled fire-teams during prime times who can mobilize quickly to attack and defend bases. GunR is one of those outfits and we also have the benefits of being able to use armor and air effectively, but we're certainly not the best VS outfit.  The greatest weakness of VS on Briggs is our failure to use command chat to coordinate our movements, though lately we've been addressing that :)   GunR, probs the best VS outfit atm, but I hardly notice them either   Because we're ninjas."

Briggs,3cl7bx,Cloudy87VS,4,Thu Jul 9 02:57:33 2015 UTC,"Check the killboard for the average BR that was being farmed. The average of the ten that I sampled was under BR20, skewed up by a single BR87 and a BR60.  I've been holding off building out a dedicated AI MBT for infantry farming because I thought it was uncool to spend my time heaping sudden death from the out of the blue upon new players.  I'd also given up my habit of using my MBT to hunt down lone sundies at 2am (usually run by BR10s.)  So if farming a shitload new players for fun is okay, I shall have no qualms at all about joining in. My terrible KDR needs all the help it can get.  I'd been thinking about sticking an AI main gun on my Mag anyway. Fuck new player retention!"

Fuck new player retention!   I Agree. Time to be selfish and focusing on getting gud"

Briggs,3cf4ou,pkisbest,2,Tue Jul 7 19:25:35 2015 UTC,? It's the same flying as before—except I'm out of practice now. I just had some duels with CanadianPilot and we both feel terrible.
Briggs,3cf4ou,paziggie,2,Tue Jul 7 22:24:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, theres been quite a few rookie pilot sitting on TR recently (we have had indar a lot). I mean sure there would have been a lot of decently skilled pilots, but im gunna guess a lot of those were rookie pilots."

Briggs,3cf4ou,diamondwing,3,Tue Jul 7 14:44:22 2015 UTC,HE lightning requires fuck all skill. A2A 71:1 is pretty fucking great
Briggs,3cf4ou,TheSpenceeee,-1,Wed Jul 8 01:58:37 2015 UTC,"Getting 100-0 in any Vehicle does require skill - you need positioning and situational awareness.  In a tank you have to worry about Air, Vehicles, Infantry and Tank Mines. Running HE makes you a massive target in particular.  It's easy to get high k/ds in the air when you fly at ceiling height with after burner and fire suppression, killing all the new pilots."

Briggs,3cf4ou,Relictor1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:37:13 2015 UTC,The analog input is immediately noticeable through things like rolling—flying flat and thrashing L/R with the mouse doesn't instantly change the direction of roll like it used to.  The other thing is that I suspect it's hard to go into hover mode - I've surprised myself at losing it a few times and definitely killed a lot of people who weren't doing it well.
Briggs,3cf4ou,JordanisJustified,2,Wed Jul 8 01:03:02 2015 UTC,"Even a shit pilot like myself was able to notice the changes, but it wasn't going to effect my brief few minutes in the air every couple of weeks.

Pounders are clearly the most versatile max weapon, being incredibly good against both vehicles and infantry. Although if I would say something that I find totally stands out on TR it's actually the claymore, which is the top tier prox mine, and as such one of the most annoying things in the game. NC, usual gripes, jackhammer and scatmaxes are made out of bullshit. VS, I love the velocity of our weapons, and it seems like we have better accuracy than other factions; Pulsar C and Orion are obviously crazy good."

Briggs,3cf523,Ilandar,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:45:43 2015 UTC,What makes the Claymore better than the other proximity mines?
Briggs,3cf523,Ridiculisk1,2,Tue Jul 7 14:37:42 2015 UTC,"They explode instantly, the others have a split second delay which usually allows you to just run through it and survive"
Briggs,3cf523,crushdepth5thFaction,2,Tue Jul 7 15:00:24 2015 UTC,They don't glow in the dark like bastards
Briggs,3cf523,NotFrenchArtaud,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:21:45 2015 UTC,"They are much easier to hide, because they have a vertical profile. They fire in front of them, instead of on top of them, so checking your path isn't enough, you have to check a much wider range of angles. This also means that you can safely place them much closer to friendly troops, because they won't explode in a wide radius, but only in area directed towards."
Briggs,3cf523,Ilandar,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:01:52 2015 UTC,"I heard they changed the trigger direction to 360 degrees...is that not the case? Also, I find them far easier to spot than the VS and NC mines due to their vertical profile. I have laid a fair amount as a TR Infiltrator, though, so maybe I just recognise the Claymore shape a little quicker than the other two."
Briggs,3cf523,NotFrenchArtaud,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:06:24 2015 UTC,"Anecdotally, maining VS the difference between betties and claymores seems pretty pronounced (ease in spotting, danger to friendlies). I'm willing to hear from others though, if their experience is vastly different."
Briggs,3cf523,SanguinaryXII,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:14:24 2015 UTC,I don't believe so. Pretty sure they're still directional.  They also deal more damage and the instant explosion means they're a lot nastier when placed well.
Briggs,3cf523,pkisbest,2,Tue Jul 7 21:54:28 2015 UTC,"They are directional from what ive seen. Ive been able to sit about 30cm behind one facing away from me, it blows up the enemy, but doesnt even harm me."
Briggs,3cf523,SanguinaryXII,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:38:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not many people utilize that. Em0verlord is a nasty one for placement, too."
Briggs,3cf523,paziggie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:08:47 2015 UTC,"Correct. Directional trigger, directional blast. A claymore placer can practically stand on the claymore and not get hurt.  However: if the claymore is blown up by an enemy the claymore will explode 360 degrees. This means if you are hiding behind a claymore and would normally be safe, if an enemy EMP triggers the claymore you are boned."
Briggs,3cf523,BUnit3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:52:04 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure if you check the stats, they also do more damage, unless it's been changed. It's the insta kill, and the fact that they can be placed out of sight, as opposed to the NC/VS ones which have to lay in plain sight, and will almost never kill a full health sprinting person."
Briggs,3cf523,paziggie,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:50:22 2015 UTC,Damage is same in outcome. You can almost die from proximity / bouncing betty and you can almost die from claymore. I've seen many people run through claymores and take the full blast yet come out with full health (no shield). They didn't have flak.
Briggs,3cf523,BUnit3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:53:08 2015 UTC,"Most times with a claymore you won't live, but you can easily survive a VS proxy. They might have changed the damage model because the original TR claymore had more damage, but stuck out like dogs balls with those bright green lights. They were the worst out of the 3 early on."
Briggs,3cf523,ctrlchris,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:11:53 2015 UTC,"The instant explosion is the killer, Prox/betty you can keep running past and get far enough away in the split second they take to explode, not the case with claymores   (Unless they changed it since I stopped playing)"
Briggs,3cf523,paziggie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:02:48 2015 UTC,So the cases where they survived after triggering it might be because they were never within the inner blast radius to cop full damage. Sounds like some stat padding testing might be required.
Briggs,3cf523,OverlordAdams,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:47:56 2015 UTC,Never thought of the claymore. Most defiantly right there. they are a bitch to avoid.
Briggs,3cf523,MetaphorTR,4,Tue Jul 7 14:32:57 2015 UTC,I find nothing more infuriating than dying to a Betelgeuse for some reason.
Briggs,3cf523,XCVJoRDANXCV,3,Tue Jul 7 20:39:38 2015 UTC,"TR guns are boring. How the heck do you guys use them? VS maxes have longer range than TR ones but both are piss weak. If you don't like your guns then come join the NC, we have retards and shotguns."
Briggs,3cf523,XCVJoRDANXCV,5,Tue Jul 7 14:12:52 2015 UTC,"come for the shotguns, stay for the retards."

Briggs,3cf523,jmz01,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:43:23 2015 UTC,"If the enemy aren't firing at an NC person, they will not fire at the enemy. You can have 2 VS/TR enemies shooting at you, and the 4 NC beside you will not fire upon them until you are dead, and they have switched their aim to someone else.  It used to be the case for the other factions to some degree, but not as bad these days. Gone are the days when I used to wear the St Paddys camo and stand at VS sundys knifing people and not get killed for a while lol."

Briggs,3cf523,Ridiculisk1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:09:04 2015 UTC,Fun fact: the baron with slugs is a 2 hit body-shot kill at close range so there is actually no reason not to run slugs
Briggs,3cf523,TintinFTW,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:14:25 2015 UTC,I thought this as well but for some reason the Barrage just seems so much nicer to use then the Sweeper.

Briggs,3cf523,DeadSenTerran,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:10:18 2015 UTC,"they're all the same. VS shotguns used to have no drop slugs, but they took that out ages ago."
Briggs,3cf523,Ridiculisk1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:16:44 2015 UTC,I though VS shotties had their bullet  velocity reduced because of the no drop and they got left like that even after drop was added?
Briggs,3cf523,DeadSenTerran,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:14:14 2015 UTC,"The NC probably have the best carbine selection, purely because of the variety and versatility available. The award for best in class would probably go to the jaguar, but that doesn't necessarily make TR carbines the best all around. The cougar is lacklustre compared to the razor or pulsar C.   Also, TR smg's"

Briggs,3cf523,Gopher5,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:51:10 2015 UTC,"Not many people use rotaries in dogfights for the same reason why not many people use CQC bolts as their go-to weapon at a fight.

But seriously the weapon i dislike most as NC would have to be the brawler, even though it is a shotgun, it is hands-down the worst shotgun i have ever used and while the underbarrel-shotgun is slightly quirky it is certainly not worth making the magazine size only 6 shots as that is hardly enough for the situations a shotgun would actually be useful in (being first into a room, etc).  EDIT: wow only an hour after I posted and my comment is already marked as contraversial just for saying something completely normal. I really don't understand how some people think"

Briggs,3cf523,paziggie,2,Tue Jul 7 20:15:20 2015 UTC,Its not AV. Well at least not heavy armour damage.
Briggs,3cf523,pkisbest,2,Tue Jul 7 22:24:23 2015 UTC,"Yes but it used to be great for taking out harassers. Now we have nothing that can compare dps wise. A vulcan harasser can switch to his gunner seat, leave his ride stationary, and outgun you."
Briggs,3cf523,paziggie,2,Tue Jul 7 23:41:13 2015 UTC,"i beg to differ. I do this often, only works if you arent moving as much either. 9 times out of 10 theres another vehicle around which just obliterates you."
Briggs,3cf523,mblades,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:42:22 2015 UTC,"True, you have to be aware of what's around you, but being able to spew constant damage is a bit more forgiving if you miss sometimes than a single shotter from a moving target, like the enforcer. The cannister was also a bit more forgiving because you would still get a partial hit, which it still does, but not the same amount of damage."
Briggs,3cf523,crushdepth5thFaction,2,Wed Jul 8 04:20:42 2015 UTC,"Try the enforcer. If you're good, you will wipe the floor with Vulcan harassers. Or just stay out of their effective range."

Briggs,3cf523,Shockwave98-,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:12:44 2015 UTC,The changes made it from a godly weapon to a completely bullshit good weapon. No longer do you die to a lightning because you have to reload. I love it.

Briggs,3cf523,BUnit3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:58:33 2015 UTC,"Guardian. I have not used it but i hate it simply because i hated doing the scout rifle directive, cannot understand why they cant give you something to use for infiltrator and instead you get a battle rifle -_-"
Briggs,3cf523,pkisbest,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:53:37 2015 UTC,"750rpm, 40 rounds for ARs and carbines is good.  167 or 200 damage chugging along like an 1800cc V-Twin is also good.  If I could have the TRV as my medic gun, and the GodSaw as my heavy I would be in heaven."
Briggs,3cf523,BUnit3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:19:41 2015 UTC,im not so much a fan of the TRV tbh. I prefer the Cycler S. Slower ROF but its recoil it literally only vertical. Little to no horizontal
Briggs,3cf523,Diamond-Darrell,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:44:00 2015 UTC,TRV was my first auraxium and I thought it was amazing. I often wonder how much better I'd be at it if I picked it up again.

Briggs,3cf523,mblades,0,Wed Jul 8 05:13:19 2015 UTC,Well that is a good point but i think ammo conservation is the last thing you care about if you want that guy near you dead and that is what the trv does well.  For me TRV is just great at hipfire things to death near you. But for more ADS accuracy than TAR is what you want in that situation.   I found the T1 Cycler S assuming this is the gun you are talking about really accurate but the dps is low due to the lower fire rate and in turn punishes any missed shots more so than either the TAR/TRV.   If anything TI cycler (default gun) is probably the better alternative.

Once you qualify for Black Ops, any time the server population is heavily skewed, players from the over popped empire(s) are given the option to activate Black Ops via a GAQ message. Once a player activates Black Ops, they’re assigned to a temporary empire which needs population most.

Briggs,3cdnzm,DerpyNerdy,2,Tue Jul 7 10:51:46 2015 UTC,Yep situational awareness is a good one. Play solo infi and watch how people move on the mini map and the flow of battle.
Briggs,3cdnzm,pedrotski,2,Tue Jul 7 03:18:22 2015 UTC,Since when do you play solo?
Briggs,3cdnzm,SanguinaryXII,2,Tue Jul 7 09:29:56 2015 UTC,I played solo inf for like 35-40br's between pub platoon leading.
Briggs,3cdnzm,pedrotski,4,Tue Jul 7 10:09:05 2015 UTC,Don't force your aim in a 1v1 as it's better to hit 3 shots to the chest than one in the head. Control angles and pick your fights. If you don't feel comfortable in a fight back off and reengage when you have the advantage.  Learn how to read the flow of the fight and when to engage/back off especially at larger fights. Minimize angles you can be shot from by sitting on terrain and behind boxes/walls. Don't trust allies. Just because there is 3 in a room behind you doesn't mean an enemy won't run through the room and shoot you in the back.
Briggs,3cdnzm,Calopix,3,Tue Jul 7 08:03:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call myself an ""elite"" player but id be happy to give some advice:  Looking at your stats you can click on heads, that's good but you don't want other planetmans clicking on yours.  Positioning goes a long way, knowing the flow from spawn options players are likely to be taking as well as flanking options. Having or being an Infiltrator will help with this, keep your dildar up!

If you have goten every possible thing config wise sorted and you know how to position yourself then it just comes down to practice. I was in your position when I started RIP and I had to step it up so I went full turbo mode into learning about game mechanics and that helped.

Briggs,3cdnzm,KaoTR,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:25:42 2015 UTC,"You've got the first few steps down already. Having a desire to improve and a good grasp of shooting.   As far as I can tell, you're accurate and really good at clicking heads. Having not played with or against you much, I can't speak for your playstyle or positioning.   I'd say talk to Kit actually, I think she went through a phase like you are now, having outstanding HSR/accuracy but wanting to improve upon positioning.   Sentry made some good points, slice the pie on your corners, utilize cover, try stick to a few weapons so you don't screw over your muscle memory. I found I didn't really start getting muscle memory down for weapons until towards the later half of an auraxium, and constantly switching between them hurt it a bit.   Use cover, consciously make an effort to look at what terrain (natural or otherwise) you can use to give yourself partial cover. Check Calo's comments about controlling your engagements, try and put yourself in a position where if it's not favourable, you can back out and re-engage on your terms.   Try not to engage an enemies on their terms (i.e. a battle rifle at 40m when you have an smg, bit obvious but you get the idea). The right tool for the job makes a pretty big difference, using a CQC carbine at mid range will punish you a lot more than using an assault rifle with good velocity/damage drop-off.   Try and play LA/Infil to help improve your positioning. These both scale very well with strong positioning, and it gives you more luxury to pick your targets, observe the battle and to get away if need be.   Aiming for the head too much can result in missed shots (again, see Calo's remark), being able to land triple+ headshots in CQC will make you a monster, but if your target is spamming ADAD and crouching you can potentially lose a lot of damage.   If you're focused on precision, do you run battle hardened as an implant? This can be pretty useful in removing variance/throwing your aim off.   As mentioned below as well? Do you run consistent high frame-rate? What's your monitor's refresh rate/Hertz?   Just some questions/tips. For the most part, out-shooting your opponent is only the first step, that might win you your 1v1 or even 2v1 situations, but controlling those situations, how many people can engage you, how well they can engage you, and how equipped you are for it are all things that will help make the difference between killing 3 guys and 10."

Briggs,3cdnzm,spudmonkey12345,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:19:14 2015 UTC,"Pick ONE weapon, ONE sight as Sentry said. I've been fucking around for literally years trying to fill out different roles with different weapons and classes (carnage for CQ, reaper for distance work, etc) and it's just fucked me over.  I don't even gaf about squad comp right now (if I get into some serious outfit stuff that may change), I've been nearly exclusively using the GD22 LMG for 400 kills straight and I'm getting to the point where in my 'good engagement range' I can bounce through headshots like an industrial sewing machine.   Having that weapon confidence lets you think less about what your gun's doing and more about what your opponents are doing. You know what your gun is doing because you've trained it to shoot things in the head. Now you get to think about which head."

Once the ISP conducts tests to prove that it's not their fault, and it's the actual physical copper line, then it's up to Telstra to fix. Certain areas are just that bad, no spare lines etc, that Telstra can't do anything about it.  A complaint to the Telecommunications Ombudsman, as you pointed out, is probably the best course of action, but doesn't guarantee that anything will be fixed."

(But thankyou Perx)  I have played the game almost every day for the past year and have been playing since the games alpha stages. As Perx mentioned ""your improvements will be based on your own initiative."" Changes never happen over night, especially with skill in planetside.   Even with knowledge passed on to you it may still take weeks if not months to properly grasp the information and effectively be able to use it in battle scenarios.     Just remember we will be giving you tips/methods to practice and train for yourself. Your improvements will be completely based off your ""will to actually improve.""   That being said, I am always happy to help others out in game if they would like it. Never be afraid to ask me.   Thanks guys, take care."

Briggs,3ccqfu,TheFullCologne,3,Tue Jul 7 06:16:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this. ^  Who are you to tell people not to play on the faction they want? Especially for a one-off or infrequent event.   I had this gripe with a small group of JUGA late at night a couple weeks/months ago. My issue isn't that it's being done, my issue is that it requires equal or greater force/organization to counter it, that can often be difficult during low-pop hours.   NC regularly has over-pop, at least when I see them - can they utilize it worth a damn? Rarely.   Long story short, it doesn't happen often, get over it. They can play whatever faction they want, individually or collectively. If it's done with the intent to improve/get a feel for working together, more power to them. As long as they know that they'll need greater numbers or equal organization to combat them (which is unlikely, so don't throw your platoon at some poor pub group with 12-24 and expect everyone to be happy)."

Briggs,3ccqfu,twistedrapier,12,Tue Jul 7 07:34:54 2015 UTC,"Fact 1: It was a grand total of about 14 (give or take) RSNC who came over to TR.  Fact 2: Before they came over, the pops were 35% NC, 32% TR, 32% VS. It just kept slowly swinging further to the TR as the alert went on.  Fact 3: We had no idea which faction we were going to be playing, so we couldn't exactly warn people. We did this last Friday as well, and we started off playing as TR but then changed over to NC midway through. If we'd actually completed the warpgating last night we were going to switch over to NC and help them push back out.  Fact 4: This was LaneSmash practice for us, not ServerSmash. However, anybody else who is looking to practice for ServerSmash could definitely do worse than trying to fight us.  Fact 5: While there was one period where VS had most of their forces fighting NC, for the majority of the time they had their main forces fighting the TR. So while TR as a whole may have had around 42% overpop, the population on every front stayed fairly even.  I do actually want to thank R18 for having the balls to stick around and fight us. Gave us a lot of good fights, and although I guess you could say we won the war there's no doubt you won quite a lot of individual battles."
Briggs,3ccqfu,equinub,9,Tue Jul 7 03:53:42 2015 UTC,Says the guy that platoon dumps a squad. Cry me a river~
Briggs,3ccqfu,RipperTR,18,Tue Jul 7 01:20:27 2015 UTC,"I don't usually reply to these kinds of threads, but I would like to inquire: Why is it an issue when for one hour across midnight TR has 42% pop? Yet I look back at NC and over the last month they have had 50%+ numerous times during primetime. But that one hour for TR is the straw that broke the camels back (And it wasn't even primetime...)? It makes no sense. I don't commonly do this but I entirely agree with Gabba (I'm stunned too). You are doing nothing but having a bit of a bitch, representing your outfit badly, over an issue that has no bearing on 'killing the server' not every pop fluctuation or alert loss/victory suddenly heralds the end of the server. Stop being a drama queen.  You keep threatening to leave the server, yet never get up the guts to do it. If everything is such a problem, grow a pair and move on. Leave the server and this reddit in peace.  Cheers."
Briggs,3ccqfu,Fawksyyy,-6,Mon Jul 6 23:35:43 2015 UTC,"Don't know what TZ you are in, it was about 8pm my time.   I don't talk about leaving the server you are mis informed.   Population advantage is one thing but overstacking pop and then combining RSNC/JUGa and whatever other jerkoffs and trying to paint it as training.   Nah I'm here calling it what it was. Bollox. And if you can't see the difference. Doh.   And I don't represent my outfit, stop attempting to supress people's opinions by trying to draw in external factors.   I don't see you as a mouth piece of SoCa so don't be silly."
Briggs,3ccqfu,Ilandar,16,Mon Jul 6 23:47:00 2015 UTC,"Come off it cunt, one squad of guys went to TR for like a single alert, they are not solely responsible for an overpop. Are you too used to rolling over bases with NC overpop, that when you see TR with 40% you get triggered into a reaction like this?   Not long ago you made a somewhat sensible post and you weren't being a fucking toss, now you've relapsed into the colossal tit you have always been smh."
Briggs,3ccqfu,Ilandar,-4,Tue Jul 7 00:04:46 2015 UTC,"I call shit how I see it and care not for likes because like auraxiums they are irrelivent.

Briggs,3ccqfu,AxisBond,3,Tue Jul 7 00:16:00 2015 UTC,"Think of it as payback for Sunday night.  Considering how often the NC is stacked, you've got no right to complain."
Briggs,3ccqfu,psych0tic,-5,Mon Jul 6 23:53:59 2015 UTC,"That was just a faction doing combined ops.   Like the TR used to do and the VS befor them.   This is different but cool, touché whatever."

The TR and VS have been dealing with consistent faction overpop for weeks/months now.  You have one night, which isn't even prime time on Briggs, where you don't have numerical advantage, and you chuck a hissy fit.  Suck it up, and use it as an excuse to practise your holding tactics like the rest of us have been."

Briggs,3ccqfu,MadMaukh,8,Mon Jul 6 23:49:07 2015 UTC,I can never understand why so many people complain about overpop in a three faction MMO. The whole point of three factions is that the two underpopped factions can have a temporary truce and work together against the overpopped one.  I shudder to think what some of you must be like in two faction MMOs where there is literally nothing you can do to overcome the issue of faction overpop.

Briggs,3ccqfu,jmz01,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:57:24 2015 UTC,"No way.  I never played the first Planetside (except for a few nights when it went f2p last year), but I've heard quite a lot of people say that its system worked very well. In the large picture it was a 3-way, but you could kick factions off individual continents and capture their warpgate, then have two-way fights over that continent. So rather than a CONSTANT three-way, you could have three-ways on some continents and/or a few different 2-way fights over different continents.  That would have been interesting if PS2 was designed to have that same thing, but they decided to go another route."

Last night it was this:    https://www.reddit.com/r/Briggs/comments/3c6z7r/so_weve_established_a_united_nc_is_op_would_vs/    Basically giving the ""organised NC OP you u no organise TR/VS"" talk. I get up this morning and check out the popcorn mill and we've got ""ermagerd organised play fuck you not cool man"". Granted, it was different threads by different people, but I still chortled."
Briggs,3ccqfu,Gabba202,2,Tue Jul 7 00:25:32 2015 UTC,"I got the impression that the ""Patters"" that these Guys here find about one Faction performing different than the other are just caused by multiple uncontrollable psychological Factors - and if we mix some Placebo effect with in the Soup we have our little consipracy Threads on Reddit, i might be wrong though"
Briggs,3ccqfu,Shockwave98-,5,Tue Jul 7 00:30:37 2015 UTC,"The population snowball effect is well documented. If a faction starts steamrolling, regardless of its starting pop there's a reactionary population swing towards that faction by combination of 4th faction jumping and others logging off.   I don't get why people don't just suck it up and do their best to shoot faces. It doesn't have to be some bitter dummy spit or drama, throwing yourself against a brick wall is good practice. Not great for your KDR but a bit of Special High Intensity Training won't kill you."

Briggs,3ccqfu,Elm11,2,Tue Jul 7 01:12:11 2015 UTC,"I've started doing the same thing late nights when TR pop is way high and just hanging in TS with the other JUGA guys while I follow them around and try (key word lol) to fuck them about while they attack bases. Bombing sunderers, attempting to break into room holds etc. Pretty much results in me having the shit shot out of me but we all get a laugh out of it. I think I'm responsible for half of Jackmacs Carv Auraxium :("
Briggs,3ccqfu,Balthizaur,2,Tue Jul 7 01:16:13 2015 UTC,attempting to break into room holds   Attempting would be an accurate description of how well it goes for me. Bashing my head against a brick wall would be closer to the mark lol.
Briggs,3ccqfu,Gabba202,2,Tue Jul 7 01:22:47 2015 UTC,Yeah same :P. It's usually closer to throwing a couple of grenades then using the gap to maybe plug one or two people them getting promptly wasted and watching everyone get revived. Good fun though.

Your so skilled stacking with JUgA and over popping TR by about 20%.   Wish I was able to be so pro like you Gabba, does it relieve your obvious sexual frustration?   Prick.   Ps. Wasn't commanding, thankfully, as it would not have been fun. You removed that when you removed any vague equality the factions had by selfishly overstacking. And you claim im cancer? Was happily telling any upset public that it was RSNC."
Briggs,3ccqfu,MikeHonchoYou,10,Mon Jul 6 22:47:17 2015 UTC,You're a cancer not only to your outfit but to this reddit and the server aswell. You spend all day spewing shit about how you're   some electrifying commander yet as soon as things get a little hard for you you come to the internet to have a bit of a whinge. I don't have sexual frustrations buddy thanks to tinder but you can keep trying till you find something that triggers me. There are good blokes in r18 doing their best to get involved with the community in the right way and it seems you're set out to stop any progress they make. They should kick you.
Briggs,3ccqfu,AxisBond,-9,Mon Jul 6 22:56:49 2015 UTC,"You need tinder? Bad luck mate and don't pretend you getting matches. Otherwise you would not have multiple characters practising wankery on briggs would Ya you sad sack of lying shite.   If you want to beat my electrifying commanding why not tell me when you plan to over stack an entire faction with kdr no sex life nerds and I'll actually turn up and command. Last night was nothing short of a server kill move, which you all lied about claiming you were doing training but you weren't.   You were just grindin that pathetic little ego RSNC needs to maintain.   If you want cancer on the server, I'll start behaving like RSNC and over stacking the already advantaged faction because that's how improve my skills right? And increase my reputation? By having public players ask 'wtf is this shit' to which I was happily replying (for the 15 minutes I was online) Rebel Scum New Conglomorate faction whoring."
Briggs,3ccqfu,MikeHonchoYou,10,Mon Jul 6 23:09:56 2015 UTC,Hahaha no I don't need tinder it just let's me shit on your face and get laid at the same time. Win win situation imo. Also I didn't know having 1 character on each faction was a crime so I don't really get what you're trying to argue there but hey you're a dickhead so I'll let you have that one coz I'm a nice guy like that. It's cute that you just assume that we are all no sex life nerds when it seems like you're the one that needs to get his dick sucked by the amount of complaining you do on reddit about a video game. Turn up to the psbl match and put  your money where your mouth is. Oh wait they probably won't put you in the team coz you're fucking trash.

Briggs,3ccqfu,BUnit3,5,Mon Jul 6 23:22:03 2015 UTC,"Just so you are aware this was practice for lanesmash not SS and the goal was not to actual capture bases (of course that is a plus) but it was to play together with people that you may have not played with before, making sure communication and composition works well together across the 2 outfits also when competing our primary faction is TR and some of us don't play TR often and wanted practice with the weapons.

Although I did see some pretty unreal crap the other night I will admit that I jumped to the conclusion and that it might've just been lag. I don't remember the server lag being limited to just one person as I was easily able to shoot mostly accurate shots on other players and Vechicles. As a response I will apologise to the player and will also proceed to ""Git gud"" as switching out from my NS-11 to my Crossbow was a horrid decision to make.   However I will still play the game.

Briggs,3cak85,twistedrapier,4,Mon Jul 6 15:33:23 2015 UTC,"What you are experiencing BendahGG, is good old fashioned Briggs server lag.  There's something real wonky with the networking code in this game lately, in that certain people will appear to take a heck of a lot more damage than normal to kill.  Trust me, I've been on the receiving end of shit like this many times.  If it is some sort of movement hack, than a good chunk of the higher skilled players on the server are using it, and I refuse to believe that.  Might as well give up on the game if that was true."
Briggs,3cak85,ChillyPhilly27,2,Mon Jul 6 13:00:02 2015 UTC,"There's nothing suss about that. Climbing up that hill at the beginning is perfectly doable, and his movement wasn't incredibly fast.

When he started shooting, he was aiming at you while you're not taking any damage, your shield nearly went upto 30-40% and then you started taking the damage, if you had 5 secs more of the video you'd be able to hear him still shooting even though you died and he got a kill feed."

Briggs,3c6z7r,Vaelkyri,2,Mon Jul 6 06:44:27 2015 UTC,I hope TR does.   It also sounds like the sort of thing that on Waterson during the first 8 months or so from release organised outfits on Vanu had a collected mumble for outfit coordination between groups. Nothing binding but just a general awareness and when people wanted to work together they could easily do so. It made for some great fights and wins (taking continents and holding their benefits through the days) with the lowest population against Total Biscuits TR outfit and a relatively higher NC pop to Vanu.   Would love to see this happen again.

Briggs,3c6z7r,Spiritrax,0,Sun Jul 5 14:18:32 2015 UTC,and NC's the only faction that does it?
Briggs,3c6z7r,Yackerz72,2,Mon Jul 6 10:55:05 2015 UTC,"No but they are the most active one in doing it . VS/TR do it when its not primetime or fights are too dull or when alert begins we need some bases to even our shit but for the NC they dont really care they will ghostcap in numbers anytime , anywhere."
Briggs,3c6z7r,Spiritrax,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:01:21 2015 UTC,well i just logged off after tr took a base with 96+ against 12-24
Briggs,3c6z7r,Yackerz72,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:35:51 2015 UTC,Yeah we needed Sierro to open space for more battles cause the NC Zerg at geological survey and aurora were pain in the ass . What about the reaver and lib gank squads 2 mossies kicked your asses but you still prevailed due to more tryhards . Plz don't give me that shit how you logged off we were being attacked by VS and plus OMY cancerous gals and there max camp near our wg so while we were desperately fighting indeed the Zerg was out of desperation especially when it was JUGA that called everyone on orders chat in order to break free from the fuck fest NC was giving us .
Briggs,3c6z7r,Spiritrax,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:45:54 2015 UTC,"so all of your zergs are justified and none of ours are, is that what your saying? My point is that every faction does this, there is no point in pinning it all on one faction. All factions can be equally cancerous at times"
Briggs,3c6z7r,Yackerz72,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:52:52 2015 UTC,First u talked about the oversight then u talked about a battle today atleast i gave my factions reason to zerg a point but for NC there is no reason just r18 the fucking point if thats not enough call every idiot from the orders chat and take the point with most numbers.
Briggs,3c6z7r,Spiritrax,-6,Wed Jul 8 00:45:03 2015 UTC,then don't ghost cap our shit.
Briggs,3c6z7r,XCVJoRDANXCV,5,Sun Jul 5 23:19:15 2015 UTC,Its the only way to break up zergs which you guys are so good at doing.
Briggs,3c6z7r,Spiritrax,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:33:42 2015 UTC,"Ghostcapping is good, it starts fights, BUT not when you drop 1/2 - a full platoon on the 1 base. I only see the NC do this. Maybe seen the VS and TR do it on the rare occasion, but NC are constantly overpopping a base without reason to do so."
Briggs,3c6z7r,pkisbest,-1,Mon Jul 6 01:52:51 2015 UTC,"VS do it a lot as well. Usually Unbless or TROL is behind it, and there's simply no reason to bang your head against a wall of maxes and galaxies so it's best to just go elsewhere. The problem (or lack of the problem) for TR is that there's no massive 'shitterfits' like there is on NC and VS.   Every single night for the last 2 weeks have seen TR have ~20% world pop while one faction sits on 40+ and just zergs everything. That's why warpgating is so common now. No one wants to fight a platoon dumping on every base."
Briggs,3c6z7r,vsshitters,2,Mon Jul 6 03:29:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, saw that numerous times over the weekend.  That Amerish alert last night was a perfect example.  Numerous times we had a squad of TR push AuraxiCom Substation and cap it, only to have a platoon drop on the squad to take it back.  I mean seriously, even if it helps your coordination, you're just making your guys rusty for when they can't rely on overpop in the SS."
Briggs,3c6z7r,twistedrapier,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:30:02 2015 UTC,The problem (or lack of the problem) for TR is that there's no massive 'shitterfits' like there is on NC and VS.   I can think of at least two.

Briggs,3c6z7r,Spiritrax,2,Mon Jul 6 11:02:24 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think the term ""shitfit"" is too harsh for any outfit on Briggs.  However, I don't think HMMR or ICE are any better than EDG3, R18 or any others you want to add to that list. Both outfits have some good players, but they're generally very disorganised, don't work well with other TR outfits and their leaders are both notorious for in-game trolling and harassment. HMMR are resembling qpL more with each passing day, which is brilliantly ironic considering Gunza's treatment of aBomber several months ago."
Briggs,3c6z7r,Ilandar,11,Mon Jul 6 11:45:11 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/JTVeytr  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)┌∩┐  EDIT: In my opinion, a proper VS command like we have had once or twice in the past would be amazing. That doesn't happen and when we rock up to the competitive scene, we are sort of looking at eachother awkwardly until we die... It'd be nice to work on that, you know?"

Briggs,3c6z7r,ljl87,4,Sun Jul 5 14:47:00 2015 UTC,VS has always had poor coordination compared to TR.  Imho some of the VS outfits really need to consider merging there slowly dying off communities.
Briggs,3c6z7r,equinub,2,Mon Jul 6 02:52:36 2015 UTC,Make the first move then. THis is how we formed RSNC
Briggs,3c6z7r,thisisxinnix,9,Mon Jul 6 03:14:45 2015 UTC,"SOCA has been doing SNO (with and without the ""TRWC"") at around the same timeslot (1830-2030) for over 2+ years.  It's a Sunday night, and (non-NC) people have things to do Monday.  If you wanted any sort of resistance you'd bring your time earlier when pops are more even, instead of a +40% ""force command""."
Briggs,3c6z7r,jf9,3,Sun Jul 5 23:58:12 2015 UTC,"I have found the 8pm start time nice as I have dinner at 730 and jump on straight after, it would seem weird playing for an hour having dinner then playing for another 45mins.  What time do most of your guys have dinner? 6 or 830 or somewhere in the middle."
Briggs,3c6z7r,KnifeyGavin,2,Mon Jul 6 02:04:50 2015 UTC,"Dinner. What are we, casuals? Coke lines and Doritos/Dew via IV.  I think most of us have dinner before or after the op. I'm usually done with mine by 6pm.  A couple of our younger members do take short breaks during the op to go eat with their folks, but for the most part it's a non-issue."
Briggs,3c6z7r,jf9,7,Mon Jul 6 02:23:55 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about this alert where NC started with 46% of the continent and 20 extra players compared to what the TR and VS had, and then ended the alert with 48% of the continent and 50-80 extra players compared to what the TR/VS had?  I imagine that having a full platoons worth of RSNC and a full platoons worth of R18 players during the alert helped stop the NC from getting crushed under such staggeringly overwhelmed odds, though I can't help but wonder just how OP they would have been had the TR and VS forces decided to tag team the NC instead of gibbering amongst themselves."
Briggs,3c6z7r,RichiesGhost,4,Sun Jul 5 14:48:03 2015 UTC,"Sometime I see tr over pop and a double teaming in progress and all I can think is""yes!"" Now it's an even fight!"
Briggs,3c6z7r,MadMaukh,0,Sun Jul 5 15:27:16 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really matter who wins or something. This whole thing was established to find communication problems in the squads, between the platoons and to see how fast people can deploy their forces. It really helped us today to find some problems in various outfits and to give them a chance to work on those issues. The most important thing is, that you run a 1:1 Server Smash simulation during this time.   Log speech short: Would be awesome if TR and VS wold join our Sunday Night ops."
Briggs,3c6z7r,PeRXeRs,6,Sun Jul 5 18:47:33 2015 UTC,Just never going to make that start time. Try joining our Sunday night ops at 7ish that has been running forever and it will more than likely revitalize the TR.

Last night was a joke if you were on the TR or VS, 2 to 1 odds on every lane. Didn't help that people who normally play TR or VS were rolling with the NC for the duration."
Briggs,3c6z7r,twistedrapier,3,Mon Jul 6 01:36:37 2015 UTC,"Yep. I ended up playing another game for those couple of hours, because every single fight was outpopped 3:1 in NC's favour. Practicing co-ordination is good, but not all on the same faction, it just ruins the fights. With world pop as low as it is, we don't need shit like this skewing the balance even more."
Briggs,3c6z7r,vsshitters,2,Mon Jul 6 03:33:01 2015 UTC,"No, as the faction they normaly play. There will be a new thread the next hours, trying to organize the event for all factions."

(cheers alienkiller)  VS would do much better with regular use of command chat BUT:- when 80% of VS squads/ platoons I join have no markers going down OR comms being used, it seems like most ""commanders"" would struggle to comprehend a second set of comms.  To the VS commanders that already use the ingame command functionality and actually coordinate for the movement of troops around the map.... THANK YOU.  The trick is going to be.... how to convince the other 80% to actually do this.  I have watched them vigorously defend their right to run zombie squads / platoons (in some cases, for years)  The other day i actually was told that ""my expectations were too high"" when i started asking questions about markers OR if the platoon lead had any problems with their comms.  Whoever wants to work together on making this happen, you (obviously) have my full support."

Briggs,3c6z7r,Ilandar,2,Sun Jul 5 23:40:57 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt say 50%. HMMR is big, but they are 50% big. 50% of TR is ICE, easily. They have around 2900 members at the current time."
Briggs,3c6z7r,pkisbest,3,Mon Jul 6 01:56:02 2015 UTC,"Obviously I was exaggerating, but you're right; ICE do have a larger presence. I guess the point I was making is that no matter what JUGA, RIP, SOCA, BOTM, PG12, RDBK, etc are doing, there will always be a massive zerg who are completely disinterested in working with them. It's a testament to those outfits that they get as much done as they do, considering how awful the rest of TR are."
Briggs,3c6z7r,Ilandar,2,Mon Jul 6 02:35:04 2015 UTC,Yep. Even at some points outfits don't wanna take orders from someone else (I prefer to strongly suggest they do one of 3 options when I'm leading a platoon)

I got really frustrated though, after a series of hard fights, to see that SOCA had spent all that time pushing VS, the lowest pop faction, all the way up the Western lane. NC ops were well advertised, they had 40% pop, and yet TR were still just stomping us whilst we were busy on the other front. I quit playing for the night a little after that."

Briggs,3c6z7r,NotFrenchArtaud,2,Tue Jul 7 01:52:55 2015 UTC,"I don't see what's fun about attacking the already embattled, lowest pop faction. Surely fun is going into tough fights against an organized op?"

Additionally fun differs for different people. Some people like a challenge against the toughest opponents. Others want to sit and farm is peace others still would prefer to push a single lattice line because they can.  Edit: to clarify. We dont always do this, just when we want a change of pace."

Turned out my graphics settings were set too low so low that I couldn't see the shiny armour anyway, so remained confused about that incident for months.  *This was also before realising that gratuitous team kills were a mandatory VVET/GunR activity."

Briggs,3c6leu,TheFullCologne,3,Sun Jul 5 09:48:37 2015 UTC,Erfy pulled up the max stats for our outfit so he decided to turn it into a script. Enjoy :). Its based on time spent in a max time in the last 30 days. There are some names that show in the API that haven't logged in but for the most part its accurate.

Briggs,3c6leu,KyesaRRi,4,Sun Jul 5 11:19:02 2015 UTC,"+1RiP community recognition.  Any chance of monthly max usage outfit leaderboards for Briggs outfits? Perhaps only a fraction of kills made by max AI weapons should be used, instead of fraction of playtime.  The outfit leaderboards should use fraction of playtime or fraction of AI kills instead of max playtime values.  Edit: Also, be sure to post on the PS2 subreddit as it seems to work fine for non-Briggs outfits."

Briggs,3c6ywy,RichiesGhost,2,Sun Jul 5 15:02:42 2015 UTC,"If the first FC doesn't put their name down for the second FC position then you can't exactly force it on them. If our new FC put their name down I'm sure they'd get voted in for a 2nd time anyway, so I think it's more a matter of them not wanting to do it twice in a row."

Briggs,3c3bvh,ljl87,2,Sun Jul 5 04:53:49 2015 UTC,"idk, in my experience Nader is one of the easier mercs to handle in pub as you can just sit back and pressure the nader into dumping their pills before engaging them, where it's just a straight up firefight with someone who can't heal themselves, throw frags at you, put down turrets etc. I play light and medium classes such as Kira for the most part and while getting directed can be annoying I don't feel it happens enough to be a problem.  Nader punishes stagnant gameplay such as hanging back and bunching up too much, as well as those who refuse to give or take ground while she has her launcher out and allow her to control both the pace of the fight and the ground that you have, as an area denial merc. On the other hand she is predictable and her nades are easily avoided by being patient or more aggressive. In pub there's very little chance a nader will direct you if you rush them.  Martyrdom is a silly perk, but quite avoidable when you've got into the pace of the game. Knowing that you're fighting a nader should mean that you don't try to gib her with a knife or approach her while she's down. Even if you do engage her in cqc, quick thinking and a long jump away is more than enough to avoid a martyrdom.  Basically, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFoB-oqhz7Q&feature=youtu.be  There's a lot of explosive spam in this game, but the only one which is truly unavoidable imo is fragger's nade for how controllable it is. Skyhammer shows a giant line in the ground, fletcher has a delay before explosion, proxy has giant lights in it, Kira tend to stand blankly out in the open setting her laser up etc."

Our ops are Wednesdays and Fridays. Leader chat isn't private, anyone who is squad/platoon lead with the certifications for leader chat (even a BR15 with 25 directive score) can listen to it. If you want it to be private, go use some other channels like Teamspeak or send personal tells to other current squad/platoon leaders. http://imgur.com/JTVeytr [x-post from here] I'm not entirely sure what was going on in NC leader chat, but I'll let the picture do the talking."

The NC leaders and many others went off for a debrief after the alert. VS and TR both decided to push the alert winners and leave each other alone. VS had the majority pop and put it all into one hex at a time and warpgated us. We all sat in Saerro fighting the TR because even with 60% pop, they couldn't take the base (because it's easily defendable), and it was a good fight."

This is just fucking shit stirring."
Briggs,3c6tke,pedrotski,2,Mon Jul 6 10:17:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for the apology.
Briggs,3c6tke,Sen7ryGun,5,Mon Jul 6 10:26:22 2015 UTC,"Wait wait, I think I've got a punch line for this:  ""Strat padding""  Bit seriously, who cares. If it's bothering you or you don't want someone listening in, just politely ask them to leave. If they refuse, you can always hit up a mod or admin (there's usually one or two of us lurking in communal TS, if it's in communal TS that it's happening) and ask us to have a chat to the person who's hanging in your channel. Alternatively, you could make a temporary passworded channel for NC command so only people you want in there have access."
Briggs,3c6tke,Wenzington,2,Mon Jul 6 01:38:14 2015 UTC,"It would've been over ingame leader comms, fuck all could be done about that.   Either way:   Strat padding   Priceless!"

Briggs,3c6tke,BUnit3,4,Sun Jul 5 13:05:42 2015 UTC,Probably still not as bad as the time RIP put a player in one of Perxers new player training platoons so they could follow them around the map and get easy kills on low BR's that were trying to learn how to play. That was a pretty shit thing to do in my opinion.

Briggs,3bxpfz,Spajina,8,Fri Jul 3 01:22:53 2015 UTC,"I loved the new player experience way back when. It was even shitter then than it is now lol. I loved it because of the FF off, giant scale, lack of instant gratification hand outs and ""Welcome to war, eat shit"" vibe of the game.

My first drop was into the middle of a 150+ fuck fest at TI Alloys with a wall of Vanguards shelling us from the crown and the VS encroaching fast from Snake Ravine. I think I lived from a grand total of 30 seconds.   Others may have landed in smaller 12s fights and had time to get their bearings and maybe even score some kills, some made BR3 or 4 before they even hit the ground thanks to clipping loaded galaxies on the way down lol."

Removes the need for a rigid time table, as you can just checkout the online members and gauge if the time is right :)   Can't recommend it enough, it's almost our secret weapon when it comes to outfit ops managment.   I hope y'all outfits get one, in the interests of Briggs activity and all.

Most of the guys are out of practice in the game and despite retaining very high headshooting capacity, the organisation and team skills are lacking. In the few PS2 get-togethers we'd had there was no conc & clear, little movement meta and even the idea of breaching as a unit was difficult...

Anecdotal experience has been that most of the top level outfits and players to be feared have been absent: I can't remember the last time I was sniped by Motherlandz, had an absolutely ball-busting JUGA hold thrown in my face, or been air-hammered by Danoli (this is actually a good thing, because air-hammer whores are the lowest form of scum excreted from Satan's rectum). Pazzword mentioned to me the other day that most of BAM's top pilots have been totally awol since the flight control changes, and this began to fit into a general impression of most of the top players choosing to step away from Briggs. Population is fine, but it seems like our more experienced players are absent, and the result is a rather flat play experience, in which the level of skill found around the map is somewhat generic, with the distinction between pub and outfit member being degraded"

But I guess the damage had already been done.

In my eyes that is not conducive to server health or playability. If there is no counter/challenge as a leader/faction/squad why press on and hamstring any possibility of one?

Also there was a counter to our squad, but it chose to warpgate the Vanu, you can't get mad at one faction for doing something that your own is doing at the same time."
Briggs,3bt0k2,Wenzington,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:46:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'm the only person here that thinks this, but I want to play this game how it was meant to be played.    So do I. But if there isn't the pop to support it, doing so can come at rather serious expense of others. As a result I don't do it all the time, some don't seem to share the same concern for others.   For a long time I did not A2G or kill sundies at this hour as I thought it was detrimental to others ability to have fights and fun. I like to maintain the relative balance so that all factions have something to do.   From the warpgate its usually a warp camp or a zerg ghost cap for the next hour. You may enjoy ghost capping and making others have to, I sure as hell mother fucking hate it and would not wish it upon anyone at that time of day. Log on, see that shit, log off.    you can't get mad at one faction for doing something that your own is doing at the same time.   I get mad at all factions equally for doing this, I will be one of the first to switch and attempt to stop it."

Only reason that their name gets brought up is they also have some lads who go full retard 24/7 and sadly are extremely effective at being so.  For the most part they don't complain, which is a wise thing given their members actions. I'd like to see you test your theory, however. Who knows I might be wrong, it might make more fights!

Briggs,3bt0k2,BrackOBoyO,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:26:31 2015 UTC,"Mmmmmm there are two important factors you are missing in your analysis.  1) Simply, put, nobody was fighting us. The entirety of the VS and NC were fighting each other at the other side of the map. As a squad leader it leaves me with two choices:  a) cap all the empty ghost cappy middle and 'have restraint' as you suggest. We win the alert easily and we get very few big good fights.   b) attack the warpgate of the most populated enemy faction. This is a much less reliable alert strategy, we were more likely to get both factions attacking us and lose in the last hour. But it certainly made the fights, fucking sweet fights, come to us. As a squad leader finding, and failing that, creating good fights is my number one job at the end of the day, especially at that time of day.  2) It was a Hossin alert! The NC not only had the most population throughout most of the alert but also had several capable forces operating. NC were in a commanding position to claim a day of skatside 2 and imho its the only time when I feel going no hold's barred is really appropriate.  Beyond anything else I think a lot of players are just enjoying a new tool. The game got assraped of its meta months ago and its pretty exciting to have even a little bit back."
Briggs,3bt0k2,Wenzington,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:33:52 2015 UTC,"So you aren't getting any fights on your fronts early morning so you warpgate an enemy faction so that you get all of the fights by killing all the existing?   If noone else is playing pro territory strategy warrior dude the server dies in the ass, boring ass whole faction zerg ghost caps after the warp camp packs up and fights the remaining faction. As far as I can see it destroys more fights than it creates for everyone else. All it does is inspire cheese, bitterness and ghost capping.   If this is the new meta, it fucking sucks."

Briggs,3btmak,NZNed,10,Thu Jul 2 01:44:33 2015 UTC,"I can think of a few active players that are better than BIR. He's a defensive farmer, which is why his KD is so high. If he actually took bases, he'd definitely be one of the scariest/best players."
Briggs,3btmak,Ridiculisk1,6,Thu Jul 2 02:08:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, generally speaking a lower Def / Attack ratio = higher KD  BIR has the lowest of anyone I have come across, I am surprised soundwaves was as close as he was.

There are a few other players I can think of that are at his level of skill or higher that actually go and cap bases, and still manage to maintain an IVI score/KD/HSR higher than his."

Briggs,3btmak,FusedBump86,5,Thu Jul 2 14:03:53 2015 UTC,"I would rate BIR higher than most of that list any day of the week. One of his biggest strengths is the fact that he can play all classes to a very high skill level which is something none of that list except maybe best/keilos can do.  As much as people hate his playstyle/attitude he is still easily one of the best ""Live"" players on briggs."
Briggs,3btmak,Calopix,2,Thu Jul 2 04:16:50 2015 UTC,"He's definitely a good player, absolutely. He's just not as scary as the people I've listed, at least to me. Those on the list tend to specialize in one or 2 classes which attributes to it as well I think. As you said, BIR is good with everything, but I'd still prefer to face him than face Soundwaves for example."
Briggs,3btmak,Ridiculisk1,2,Thu Jul 2 04:27:01 2015 UTC,Yeah hes not the best in each of the classes but his flexibility is what makes him stand out to me.   In terms of best people on your list for specifics I would say   HA - Exo  LA - Soundwaves  Infil - Motherlandz
Briggs,3btmak,Calopix,0,Thu Jul 2 05:16:59 2015 UTC,Yeah because only GAB players on the entire server can do most things...
Briggs,3btmak,SoundwavesPS2,3,Thu Jul 2 04:30:16 2015 UTC,Most players stick to one or two classes. Most Infil players stick to Infil/HA. Most HA/LA players stick to those two classes. Wooldoor was the only player on that list apart from best/keilos that I saw playing the 3 on a regular basis.
Briggs,3btmak,Calopix,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:14:11 2015 UTC,"Most people specialize a bit, or aren't good at everything. To find players who are good at all aspects (or most) is pretty rare."

Briggs,3btmak,NSGDX1,2,Thu Jul 2 15:14:49 2015 UTC,I don't think I should be on that list.  In my opinion BIR is the best or one the best players left on briggs.  I mean I hate the guy but he is much better than most.
Briggs,3btmak,PleasureWolf,2,Thu Jul 2 05:58:12 2015 UTC,"You're a bloody good player as well. Of course no one would put themselves on the level of the elite players (except maybe ego-filled people like BIR haha), but I do think you're one of the best.   Jeez, this thread seems ass-kissy now hahaha"
Briggs,3btmak,Ridiculisk1,0,Thu Jul 2 06:08:25 2015 UTC,"Haaaaa, you got on the list at least! :P You've been hanging around me too much and underselling yourself like I do apparently.  On a more serious note regarding your post though, yeah BIR is a bit douchy but he's one of the best who is still /consistently/ good on a daily basis. He can pick up mostly anything and make it work which most players can't.  Might I add he can also aim in ESF's, I remember doing a few 1v1's with him."
Briggs,3btmak,Kitarix,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:06:31 2015 UTC,"Of those I can beat a few, if I'm on the ball. The only ones I can't, even when I'm at my best, are Exo, Keilos, Motherlandz, 60. Of course, there is also BIR (not on the list).   These people are a higher tier again, I never get a kill on any of them unless they're in a panic, drunk, or getting ganged."
Briggs,3btmak,Shepherd336,2,Thu Jul 2 05:02:46 2015 UTC,"Yea, they're all very good players, as well as a couple others I forgot to add like Gabba, Calo, Spud, Swegmantis, Sunmoonstar is kinda good too. Even Picard is a solid player.   I killed Exo once I think. Highlight of my life right there. I would argue that Exo is the single best infantry player on the server, but that's another story altogether. I've killed everyone at least once I think, except for Keilos.   They're all very good players, but mainly due to their unpredictability, I'd prefer to face BIR over them."
Briggs,3btmak,Ridiculisk1,5,Thu Jul 2 05:09:16 2015 UTC,"I die a lot more than everyone on the list typically coz i'm more aggressive, at least that's how I feel. I find myself dying a lot to 'worse' players because I always try to bite more than I can chew."

You frequently wreck me, as you did tonight while playing VS. I think I got you once out of the 20+ times we crossed paths. Like Soundwaves, I can never tell where you're coming from, and that's terrifying."
Briggs,3btmak,Ridiculisk1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:20:08 2015 UTC,Its all about consistency man. I've killed most of those players on that list once or twice but I'm sure I speak the same as many players when I say that. What separates me from you and the others is the consistency of your play. Just accept your pedestal and get worshipped bitch. Stahp complainin your shit. Thats my fucking job :P
Briggs,3btmak,FckThisNameTakenBull,2,Thu Jul 2 16:33:36 2015 UTC,"Not really, I've seen BIR at plenty of bases being attacked by the NC, especially when he was doing his medic directive. He was actually one of the very few medics that will make sure that the area is clear before he rezs you. I think that if he was just playing defence, he would have far more base defences under his belt, yet even I have more than him. The fact that he generally plays either solo or with only a couple of other guys, makes it kind of hard to get base caps, instead they attach themselves to a good assault. You won't see him at many fights where NC has the massive overpop while attacking a base, no point, not enough kills to be had for him."
Briggs,3btmak,BUnit3,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:20:47 2015 UTC,"I suppose there is some bias on my part, as I don't really notice where he is unless I'm not playing NC. He still focuses more on the farm than on territory (not that there's anything wrong with that of course), and the best farms are when the enemy is attacking you, because you have the advantage of spawn rooms/teleporters."
Briggs,3btmak,Ridiculisk1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:17:47 2015 UTC,"the best farms are when the enemy is attacking you, because you have the advantage of spawn rooms/teleporters.   For sure, but to maintain a good kph, I think you just have to go where the best fighting is, preferably 50/50 or close to it. Defences are great because you can flank people who are trying to overlook the spawn room."
Briggs,3btmak,BUnit3,3,Thu Jul 2 04:33:13 2015 UTC,For best KPH you ideally want to be outnumbered 60/40. Base plays a factor too for example tower farming is a lot easier.
Briggs,3btmak,Gabba202,2,Thu Jul 2 05:23:34 2015 UTC,"I still love tower fights, even after all this time."
Briggs,3btmak,BUnit3,2,Thu Jul 2 06:23:41 2015 UTC,"Yea. Aside from medkit padding, kph is pretty hard to raise on Briggs. 24-48 50/50 fights are good farms.   I think another part of why BIR doesn't attack often is that he avoids NC overpop fights (like you said), and a lot of NC attacks are overpopped. Then again, every faction does it, but it's more fun to defend against overpop than it is to be part of the overpop."
Briggs,3btmak,Ridiculisk1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:41:40 2015 UTC,"I will quite often redeploy to a defence facing an overpop, not only to try and save the base, but because good farm potential lol. There was one on Esamir a few weeks back where I got 35 VS kills in about 3 minutes at Watersons Redemption against huge overpop. Although my record is still about 60 in 3 minutes against the TR in a tower fight, pre-resource nerf though."

Briggs,3btmak,ChillyPhilly27,2,Thu Jul 2 05:00:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, we are different, because I'm a terrible player compared to him. Also, you have to take into account my stats for the first 50-60 BRs, which were shit due to being a scrub (well, more of a scrub than I am now). I still wouldn't even put myself in the same league as BIR. I do play extremely defensively though, cause I like defending. Hard spawns = easier fights, so that's where I go most of the time."

Briggs,3btmak,Orblitzer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:10:41 2015 UTC,"Well, not necessarily defensive in that sense, but I prefer defending bases because of the hard spawns. I do play aggressive when needed and I'm getting better at it (in that I'm no longer the first to die)"

Pilot score 2398 vs 271  KDR 24.3 vs 2.71   Some players should stick to what they're good at, BIR's is defensive infantry farming and KDR padding."

In the times I did do air fights with him he was able to hit me quite often and some days really just wrecked me.   I don't believe the pilot stats on Dasanfall are accurate to describe someone's ability to fly either might I add, given that the air game has perhaps just as many or more factors that come into play than the infantry game."
Briggs,3btmak,Kitarix,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:08:49 2015 UTC,"Nice try, I liked the effort but BIR is better than you.  The reason why you're Pilot score is higher is because you played in your scythe back in 2013, and you have about 3x of lol pod kills."

Are the crashes at random or only when you do something or go somewhere specific?  Have you checked your hardware temps?  If that still doesn't work try typing ""msconfig"" into the start menu search bar and go to the startup tab and unselect all but the essentials then reboot and try again. This will stop any other programs starting up with windows.  Best of luck getting it sorted."

Having said that, I'm close to finishing the side arm directive, the last 400ish mag scatter kills needed are tedious. It's either try to out dps people with a very low dps gun, or use your primary take most of their health, then switch to pistol to finish, and hope they don't kill you first lol. Next stop, about 800ish kills with the slasher to complete the exceptional directive."

Briggs,3br1i4,Gabba202,3,Wed Jul 1 20:40:22 2015 UTC,"Burlesque (literary):       Burlesque is a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects.  The word derives from the Italian burlesco, which, in turn, is derived from the Italian burla – a joke, ridicule or mockery.   Burlesque overlaps in meaning with caricature, parody and travesty, and, in its theatrical sense, with extravaganza, as presented during the Victorian era.  ""Burlesque"" has been used in English in this literary and theatrical sense since the late 17th century. It has been applied retrospectively to works of Chaucer and Shakespeare and to the Graeco-Roman classics.  Contrasting examples of literary burlesque are Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock and Samuel Butler's Hudibras. An example of musical burlesque is Richard Strauss's 1890 Burleske for piano and orchestra. Examples of theatrical burlesques include W. S. Gilbert's Robert the Devil and the A. C. Torr – Meyer Lutz shows, including Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué.  A later use of the term, particularly in the United States, refers to performances in a variety show format. These were popular from the 1860s to the 1940s, often in cabarets and clubs, as well as theatres, and featured bawdy comedy and female striptease. Some Hollywood films attempted to recreate the spirit of these performances from the 1930s to the 1960s, or included burlesque-style scenes within dramatic films, such as 1972's Cabaret and 1979's All That Jazz, among others. There has been a resurgence of interest in this format since the 1990s.       Relevant: Burlesque | Parody religion | Achewood | American burlesque   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Briggs,3bon2w,Miniappolis,3,Tue Jun 30 23:34:01 2015 UTC,if its beyond 10 pm most leaders / people have IRL stuff the next day.   give it till friday?  edit i did hear some talk about gearing up for bigger more organised friday nights from some lads on TR recently...  i wouldn't mind resting up through the week if it meant MASSIVE participation on the weekends.
Briggs,3bon2w,-unbless-,6,Wed Jul 1 01:58:06 2015 UTC,As long as two factions ACTUALLY FIGHT EACHOTHER there will be a fight instead of scared platoon leaders keeping their precious cookies in the oven 300m in the air because they know they'll crumble when shit gets too hot.
Briggs,3bon2w,Gabba202,11,Tue Jun 30 22:37:00 2015 UTC,was too busy thinking about cookies to realise you actually meant galaxies.
Briggs,3bon2w,diamondwing,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:11:12 2015 UTC,Basically lots of people have quit on VS.
Briggs,3bon2w,Spajina,4,Tue Jun 30 22:17:58 2015 UTC,"Why would you play VS when you can play NC instead and be immune to having your shit ""balanced"".  VS have 2 exceptional weapons right now which will soon be 0.  Yet, while this frantic rebalancing effort from DBG to completely reduce VS to sheer mediocrity in everything they use continues, ravens, cyclones, anchor (getting buffed lol), hacksaws (and every other NC AI max weapon for that matter), airhammer, phoenix (especially from spawn room shields) and the list goes on, continue untouched.  Along with everything else, it's pretty easy to see why VS isn't exactly thriving any more."
Briggs,3bon2w,Palermah,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:23:11 2015 UTC,anchor (getting buffed lol)... continue untouched.   MRW
Briggs,3bon2w,FernandoSteel,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:43:06 2015 UTC,"Pretty much my thoughts exactly, I'm honestly surprised TR wasnt the lowest pop during the betelgeuse and orion glory days"
Briggs,3bon2w,UnnamedSG,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:57:20 2015 UTC,"Admittedly I haven't really been around much at prime time for the last couple of weeks so don't know what has been happening during this period, but before that TR were definitely the underpopped faction (sometimes significantly so) during prime time, and have been for 2-3 months. Of course that swings around so that TR is generally overpopped from 11pm-2am, then NC take over after that."
Briggs,3bon2w,AxisBond,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:22:54 2015 UTC,"You know , I actually can see where the sentiment comes from, I sometimes feel the same about tr. But you guys have higher tier directive weps worth getting,  a unique tank and esf and good lore. Nc has the tank and esf too but if you want mediocrity, tr used to be the whipping boy, now at least there are some strengths in tr, especially in numbers. I would say at least dbg is being more even handed in handing out the mediocrity.  But seriously,  fuck the cyclone."
Briggs,3bon2w,Tinuva450,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:29:39 2015 UTC,"Well since the archer has been brought into the game, Ravens have lost a lot of their effectiveness (which is a good thing).  SMGs should be removed from heavies fullstop. Phoenix's while having a nifty trait are mediocre IMHO. I haven't really used hacksaws much, I have always preferred Mattocks (slugs) and Scatters. We also don't know that any buff to the anchor will hit live."
Briggs,3bon2w,paziggie,2,Wed Jul 1 05:33:01 2015 UTC,"I challenge your ""mediocre"" and raise you a ""Striker""!"
Briggs,3bon2w,BUnit3,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:46:43 2015 UTC,"Poor thing, it was broken as shit when it first came out, and they were too heavy handed with the nerfing stick."
Briggs,3bon2w,paziggie,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:53:28 2015 UTC,If they just fixed that problem where the rockets went through terrain I think it would have been much fairer.
Briggs,3bon2w,BUnit3,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:17:32 2015 UTC,"One of the IB guys made a funny video about that. Not only did they go through terrain, but he was able to stand with his back facing an esf and shoot the rockets backwards lol. Once you obtained a lock, it couldn't be broken, and flares didn't always remove all of the rockets. Just a poorly tested design before being allowed to go live."
Briggs,3bon2w,paziggie,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:05:14 2015 UTC,"That flares breaking locks issue was on the other rockets as well from memory, the Striker just made things worse because it could also go  through terrain and did more damage in a full unbroken burst than a single lock-on rocket would.  Now that the locke/flare system and terrain collision system have been fixed I think the original Striker may actually be quite palatable."
Briggs,3bon2w,Tinuva450,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:02:10 2015 UTC,"We can all agree, the Striker is nothing like it was when it was originally launched. It is in a pretty bad place at the moment."
Briggs,3bon2w,paziggie,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:33:53 2015 UTC,"I think you'd be surprised how annoying the phoenix is to be honest. It obviously has a niche role to play, but in some circumstances a single phoenix can be extremely effective at pissing off surrounding infantry and armour and when you get more than one of them firing on you they're a royal pain in the arse."
Briggs,3bon2w,Tinuva450,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:19:46 2015 UTC,"My gripe with the phoenix is that you can outrep the damage from a single user when you factor in reload time. Am I being arrogant if I state that being troubled by phoenix users from a spawn room is more an issue of poorly placed sundies?   I don't often fight against them so I cannot comment on their annoyance, but I can say that lancer squads are exceptionally annoying for armour zergs so all weapons have their uses (except the striker as agreed)."
Briggs,3bon2w,paziggie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:48:43 2015 UTC,"You can also pretty much out-rep the damage from a decimator as well though, but with a phoenix if you see an engineer running around repairing it (and dodging rockets) you can chase after him with the phoenix, trip him over and steal his wallet.  Also, you can have an amazingly placed sunderer and a phoenix can still get it. Those things go around corners and inside caves and shit, it's amazing how inventive you NC guys are at shooting our stuff."
Briggs,3bon2w,Tinuva450,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:59:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the fact that the dps of phoenix's are even worse, then they become very inefficient. I would hardly say that a phoenix excels at hitting moving targets let alone moving infantry and nobody can be felled in one shot so I miss your point there; besides if you get non fatal damage and you are standing next to a sundy you should immediately resupply for full shields again.  Well those sunderer's arnt probably being hit by spawn room defenders then, in which case I say, kill the people standing still holding rocket launchers."
Briggs,3bon2w,paziggie,2,Thu Jul 2 02:08:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah.. I think you need to play on the TR against the NC's enterprising Phoenix users. You would be rather surprised by the ingenuity these bastards have. I've seen infantry running across the battlefield with phoenixes chasing after (and killing) them. I've seen phoenixes being fired from spawn rooms, doing a circle around the battlements of the fortress and then down the other side to hit the sundy's roof. I've seen phoenixes chase MAXes through a door and up a stairs.  You can't do that shit with dumbfire rockets hey. If my squad is going up against NC there will almost always be a daily occasion where someone reports that the NC are firing phoenixes on our position and it somehow threatens our attack or defense. They're annoying as all hell."
Briggs,3bon2w,UnnamedSG,0,Thu Jul 2 08:17:59 2015 UTC,"saying ""it's not as good as it was"" doesnt mean it still isnt op as fuck :P and phoenixes are amazing. that trait is very easily abused and can win nearly every defensive fight by just having 3 or 4 heavies in spawn room, that said, the lancer is also pretty damn good, but compared to how often and easy phoenixes can be used, the lancer looks like a useless teddy bear with no arms.  the problem people (myself included) with NC maxes AI guns is that they are shotguns, and even mattocks with slugs still beat the other 2 AI and most of the time AV maxes in every situtation  the problem with the anchor ""buffs"" is that they are considering buffing an already amazing weapon for no justifiable reason, unless that buff includes switching the anchor and gauss saw's places (making the anchor the default, and gauss saw the unlockable one) then I see no reason to change it.  SMG heavies tbh, are not a problem, the cyclone is a little bit op on heavies, but its not really OMG WTF BBQ ON FIRE N BANELINGS FALLING FROM THE SKY op like people would say shotgun maxes are, I honestly feel like either every factions smg's should be brought to the same level as VS's SMG's  I think smg heavies are fine because they trade accuracy/utility for usable hipfire, at the cost of clipsize, accuracy and effective distance"
Briggs,3bon2w,BUnit3,2,Wed Jul 1 09:04:17 2015 UTC,"I still think the lancer is amazing, but people don't play it to it's strengths. You can hit vehicles from outside their render range, what's not to love?"
Briggs,3bon2w,Tinuva450,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:54:34 2015 UTC,"well in my experience so far (I don't max often and when I do it is usually inside), being outside now in a max suit paints you as a target for an Archer. Lockdown would be OP as fuck if you weren't such an easy target; archers have leveled the playing field by making Raven maxes manageable. Could fractures now get a buff now? maybe."

Briggs,3bmm1u,EzJustCorry,14,Tue Jun 30 13:10:05 2015 UTC,"This isnt right. every player has a right to play the game the way they want to. and this guy just straight away attacks his way of earning certs. Their isn't a right or wrong way of playing planetside (unless you use hacking) just ways you can play it.   We all started from BR1 and made our ways up through those ranks. I was a fool who saw sniping as my way of earning certs. but found reviving was a better source of income. This isnt a way to treat this new guy, sure he gives him advice on being an engineer. but since when has players of briggs told others how to play anothers game?  WE DONT WANT OTHERS TELLING US HOW TO PLAY THE GAME.   We have leaders that we CHOOSE to follow.   We have our own minds to CHOOSE where we want to go.   We CHOOSE to play the game as we seem fit.   The game has gone so far as to CHOOSE whether or not we want to be revived. here is a point worth mentioning.  What if this was a Korean player? We should be welcoming new players to the game, and instead this guy tells this guy to play the game in his desire. WRONG ATTITUDE BRO."
Briggs,3bmm1u,JMR188,5,Tue Jun 30 13:32:46 2015 UTC,"I'm all about free will- I've gone out of my way to stick up for how others want to play the game.  Having said that- this guy is is giving pure, legit advice on how to improve/be more efficient. Even if he is being blunt about it.  He's probably just been rez'd by that medic with a low level medtool and then left to stagger around with 1/3 of his health... likely resulting in him getting dropped by his next opponent. Which is just annoying, and more importantly unnecessary   There's nothing stopping low-level-medtool medics rezzing people and yeah, we shouldn't discourage them; but they need to a) clear opponents out of the immediate area/wait till the area has been cleared by others, and b) do a top-up heal before running off, and c) pump certs into their medtools asap"
Briggs,3bmm1u,kurosan,4,Wed Jul 1 02:53:03 2015 UTC,What he said isn't that bad at the start even notifying the guy that each BR will give him another 100 certs. Low med tool revives are the worst and he suggested that the guy play another class to earn certs quickly without being a cunt. Harden the fuck up.
Briggs,3bmm1u,Gabba202,2,Tue Jun 30 22:30:03 2015 UTC,"Nah bro CumLover69 talked some shit in yell, this definitely warrants an essay on reddit about elitism. If that player was Korean it could have sparked an international incident."
Briggs,3bmm1u,CassiusDean,10,Tue Jun 30 23:44:31 2015 UTC,"Only RSNC can hold a candle to our enemies at a 2+ KD  KD   Yeah, you can tell this guy's a shitter because he uses KD as a metric to determine worth in a game about holding points and filling out a variety of roles.  Oh yeah, also because he thinks victory in an SS is dependent on having a higher KD."
Briggs,3bmm1u,Livingthepunlife,6,Tue Jun 30 13:33:48 2015 UTC,Dead bodies can't take or hold points. You either shoot the enemy and keep them off the point or get shot yourself and lose the base. That. Fucking. Simple. - Connery Player   Davy I don't want to start a shit storm here but stop thinking KDR is irrelevant in SS.
Briggs,3bmm1u,TheUltimateChing,7,Tue Jun 30 13:42:22 2015 UTC,"Okay, you and I will always have our difference in opinion about SS and KD, and that's fine.  But the fact of that matter is that by blocking access to the smash to people who aren't ""good enough"" or who don't have a high enough KDR, we're going down the same path as Cobad, and all we're going to end up with is a bunch of burnt out vets who don't want to play and the rest of the server backing out because we got told we're not good enough for smash.  Yes, it would be nice if every outfit that could come to smash was as good as RSNC, old-GAB and old-JUGA, but the fact of that matter is that we don't have the fucking numbers or skill capacity.  And sure, we can go to trainings every Sunday (Are you guys running that this Sunday btw? I think the GunR folks are interested in running with you guys again and I sure as hell could use some help getting better at the game) and run outfit ops, but at the end of the day, it does feel like the sun is setting on Briggs.  It would be nice if we could afford to stack the teams (because let's be real, instituting a KDR-based entry requirement is effectively stacking the teams, as SS is meant to be a sever-wide average, not the top-tier outfits and only the top-tier outfits), but given our pop situation and our verterancy leaving rate, we'd get stomped because the other servers have a much larger pool of high skill.  Anyway, I don't want to start a shit storm here either, but my opinion remains that a high KDR is not the cause of victory, but teamwork, co-operation and tactical play are the cause of victory, and KDR is merely a fraction of what we need to win."
Briggs,3bmm1u,Livingthepunlife,3,Tue Jun 30 13:55:40 2015 UTC,"A key issue I see here is that many players lack the ability to get a good KD, fullstop. Even when they try to farm, they fail. They go full retard on squad play with heart and fail to realise that individual skill helps the squad and it stacks when others do the same.   Sure you shouldn't abandon the squad during squad play to get kills, but knowing how to get kills is really motherfucking important in squads. You set up slay points to delay the enemy from reaching points etc. A good LA in a bio lab for example - kills half the motherfuckers charging out or at least wounds them and calls out numbers/locations/directions.   Killing potential is always a valuable asset and it does not come at the expense of any other ability. The more killers we have, the better we are. KD whether recent or overall is useful, not everything, but still handy in determining effectiveness and understanding of gameplay.   Players who get 0.2 KD, are they an asset or a liability? Sure they might be support class but if they are dieing so much and are dead all the time how much supporting can they really do?  RSNC has done well encouraging other members to pick their game up, we help eachother get better at the game as individual players and as a team. I can only hope and encourage other outfits do the same."
Briggs,3bmm1u,Wenzington,4,Wed Jul 1 02:13:49 2015 UTC,"Fuck no, I dont want to tell people to fuck off because they aren't as good as others. Everyone should be allowed to play however I just hate that people think KDR is useless and dying on a point wins SS. Thats all :D"
Briggs,3bmm1u,TheUltimateChing,4,Tue Jun 30 14:43:06 2015 UTC,"Does being TSAR sniped in the head dozens of times while repping a running max count as a ""good"" death?"
Briggs,3bmm1u,equinub,5,Tue Jun 30 18:06:28 2015 UTC,"Oh, this entire time I was thinkign that based on the post you made in Briggsmash that you wanted only people of certain KD to go into SS or some crap like that, lol.  And while I do think that it is useless if you use it as the sole metric, I do know that it holds some merit if you factor it in with other stats.  I'm a fucking muppet..."
Briggs,3bmm1u,Livingthepunlife,2,Tue Jun 30 14:53:55 2015 UTC,Yeah no the main issue is people just being apethetic about improving. We can't hugbox shit all the time and theres a point were you just have to nut up and accept that there's room go improve. Even i get annoyed following ss when people say all these things then new follow through. Like i joind rsnc and started trying to get better simply because of who I surrounded myself with. Hell I streamed myself playing tonight and had ching critiquing my shit(and it was literally shit I was playing so bad it wasn't funny).
Briggs,3bmm1u,AzureProdigy,3,Tue Jun 30 15:26:52 2015 UTC,"There's always room to improve, no matter how good you are. And if the problem is people being apathetic about improving, then obviously there's some form of incentive needed. Whether it be recognising the top 10 players/outfits on the leaderboards each week with a thread on reddit (maybe even a weekly victor's user-flair) or something like that, there needs to be some way to show the players that their improvement is a good thing, because it's honestly hard to see it in-game. (Although it is refreshing to see my KD go from 0.4 to 0.6 over the past few months, even if I am shitting around in a lightning or heavy crutching)  However, it would be hard (logistically speaking) to set all that up, but there could definitely be some recognition of BSNO, good outfit and strats/tactics that work on the subreddit simply to help people pick up new ideas to improve their play. Hell, we could even make a new sub (/r/BriggsMentors or something) where people can organise ops and shit to learn better aspects of the game."
Briggs,3bmm1u,Livingthepunlife,3,Tue Jun 30 15:48:48 2015 UTC,"Whether it be recognising the top 10 players/outfits on the leaderboards each week with a thread on reddit   The problem being, you are glorifying the farmers, the battlegoose HA medkit spamming farmer that is the typical player on Briggs."

Dead people don't cap points.
Briggs,3bmm1u,Gabba202,4,Tue Jun 30 22:32:42 2015 UTC,"Dead people don't cap points.   Tell that to the medics. In this last SS, too many times we had a room full of low health people and medics trying to shoot enemies instead of getting the heavies around them back up to full health. Out of all the SS's, with the exception of same squad medics, it was the least I have been healed and rezzed without Hail Mary rez nades in useless situations. I had that many enemies standing on my corpse that if they threw a frag nade, they would have probably killed a couple at least.  Bring your boy CollarBone in to do some training on how to medic to the rest of the server, he is still the best I've seen to this day."
Briggs,3bmm1u,BUnit3,4,Tue Jun 30 23:51:14 2015 UTC,"In this last SS, too many times we had a room full of low health people and medics trying to shoot enemies instead of getting the heavies around them back up to full health.    That seems like a squad level problem, you really only need 1 good medic or two average medics per squad to keep everyone going. We had a total of 4-5 medics in our platoon on the east and never felt like we needed more, everyone else was just slaying the enemy before they got to the point.  The more you kill/stay alive, the higher the chances of beating back the enemy before they overwhelm you, which successfully happened 4 times."
Briggs,3bmm1u,TheFullCologne,2,Wed Jul 1 01:47:45 2015 UTC,"That seems like a squad level problem,   No, I'm talking 96+ in a hex, multiple squads in a room, everyone too worried that someone is going to come through that door, rather than medics being a bit more situational aware and having faith that the heavies around them will be on guard."
Briggs,3bmm1u,BUnit3,5,Wed Jul 1 02:11:08 2015 UTC,"I'd wager LukeXIII is, mainly cos he makes all the baddies dead and he still manages to revive you whilst reloading and having a cuppa waiting for the next wave."
Briggs,3bmm1u,Wenzington,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:25:55 2015 UTC,"I actually agree that in things like SS or even live a higher KDR player can help hold a point quite effectively and a group of them (providing they play the point and don't abandon the objective to go have a bit of a farm) can be a nightmare to force off a point if the group you are with aren't working together and just stream in and die (I have done this before but I admit I am not a good player).  Saying that it is not the be all and end all, if a high KDR player is sitting in a corner away from anything useful playing with himself so he doesn't die to protect his KDR he is as useful as tits on a bull.  I have never and will never likely join a SS simply because I suck and don't want to bring the team down or take the place of someone who would be better for the roll, but those who do go out there and are good I tip my hat to you all and will see you at some point in live awaiting my head to be blown off."

Briggs,3bmm1u,TheFullCologne,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:57:25 2015 UTC,And if you are killing more than being killed (aka positive kd) then base captures are a shit ton easier.
Briggs,3bmm1u,Dylan_NZL,7,Tue Jun 30 20:44:38 2015 UTC,"Or you haven't taken out their spawn solutions, allowing them to eventually wear you out by attrition, which is what I've seen dozens of times in SS.  It doesn't matter if you can keep killing the same guys over and over, eventually more of them will turn up, they will pull more maxs, something will change and they will overrun you, happens every time.  This was what annoyed me in the previous couple of SS's to the most recent one. We watched some of our BAM guys using airhammer etc to farm infantry, only to allow those infantry to just respawn, rather than take out the spawn solutions. Good for player KDR, not good for base cap/defence for our team."
Briggs,3bmm1u,BUnit3,3,Wed Jul 1 00:05:25 2015 UTC,"Yeaahhh.. That's a bit much.   You can tell the difference in the revive speed, and there's no obligation to accept it. At worst your chances of a higher level revive are removed.   It actually sounds like a serious comment, rather than just baiting.   Generally support classes are the best way to start your certs off, but there's nothing to say you should be required to fill that role. God know's how many low BRs decide to play Infil and sit up on a mountain completely removed from any real purpose.   While I encourage new player progression, telling someone not to bother reviving and spend all your early certs into a medic tool is stupid. There's nothing to say a low BR can't safely revive you, or patch you up after. The option to accept a revive is always that.   Guy sounds like a cunt, serious or not, also, dat name."
Briggs,3bmm1u,SanguinaryXII,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:33:04 2015 UTC,"spend all your early certs into a medic tool is stupid.   Stupid like a fox! It's a sound investment.  Moar certs into medtool equals quicker heal/rez times, meaning moar certs per minute. Also you're less likely to get shot if you're rezzin with a pimped out tool because it's only in your hand for a second before your hot green light has worked its magic on the fallen friendlies face - you can then get out your other gun and start shooting mans in the face and get moar certs.   There's nothing to say a low BR can't safely revive you, or patch you up after.    Apart from their lack of experience, situational awareness, and certed up medgun.   Quick question: you die in a doorway and you start getting rezzed. Do you want the medic to be using a medmagicdevice that will get you up in an instant at full health, or one that takes a shitload of time and only gets you up at half health?  Second quick question: you killed a dude in a doorway and now he is being rezzed. Do you want the medic to be using a medbullshithealmachine that will get him up in an instant, or one that will take a shitload of time and only get him up at half health?  I don't know about you, but if I'm getting rezzed I want to be up quick and at full health so that I can get out of that doorway asap. Of course, having an enemy take forever to get up and then having them get up at half health is a nice start for getting them back down again.   The option to accept a revive is always that.    Though there is no option to accept the rez from the max medhammer compared to the stock standard one. It's first medic, only medic. There is no choice there."
Briggs,3bmm1u,RichiesGhost,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:57:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it doesn't pay dividends on itself, what i'm saying is telling every new player that they have to play either medic or engineer and be someone's pocket helper isn't fair, and plenty of people won't find that fun.   Just because someone's a low BR, doesn't mean they can't have an IQ above that of a doorknob. If they're new to FPS in general, sure, they'll suck in all of the above-mentioned ways, heck, even if they aren't they might. I merely stated that not every low BR is going to be braindead. Not every situation NEEDS you to be up and back in the fight in under 2s.   Yes, it's more of a liability, the longer you spend looking down your medgun, the longer the enemy has to come find you and put some lovely big holes in you - but how does a poorly certed medgun fare against a revive grenade. Do you accept those? Those are pretty popular. Should they cert those and throw them with impunity instead?   I know some people who won't accept revives, it's a given that the better the revive, the better the situation will fare for both parties (reviver and revivee).   Can't do much about the one revive only option, but it's really not that big of a deal. You get hit with a revive grenade and you're in the same boat, the only difference is you can hope that medic threw it so he could point the gun at the enemies to keep you safe, not just get some easy certs off your limp body."

Briggs,3bgqua,RipperTR,7,Mon Jun 29 02:56:17 2015 UTC,"Real talks  The upcoming Tournament isn't just Server Smash, it's a tournament. Every other server will be stacking and bringing their best. It's quite evident that after loosing so many vets and leaders in recent months for extremely justifiable reasons we just don't have as many medium and high tier outfits as the other servers do... so we need to use the resources that we do have.   We have arguably the best air force in the game, some of the best outfits currently in the game, we have a brilliant harasser squad capable of well over 200 sundy kills a match. We have point hold outfits and attacking outfits. We have demonstrated that we can combined arms and outplay every other server in the game. What we are lacking is a Quick Reaction Force, for when all the above parts of an ss team aren't able to push through a cap, or make a last minute defence.   I think R18 would make a perfect quick reaction force. We can't put our best outfits into a qrf, we need them on the ground holding cunts back. R18 knows how to flood a base, move together and crash a point to wipe everyone. They play like this on live everyday. If their leaders do one thing well, it's this. Give them a goal, a purpose and point them towards enemy dudes, they will surprise everyone. No I don't like them, or how they play on live, but seriously give picard a qrf platoon, he'll get them motivated and moving quickly while reading the map for the next target."
Briggs,3bgqua,SlingingNumber4,25,Mon Jun 29 03:40:39 2015 UTC,"R18 would be perfect for this role, no doubt about that. Problem is them working well with others, its been an issue in the past and continues to be one in the present."
Briggs,3bgqua,goots93,13,Mon Jun 29 08:29:34 2015 UTC,The thing about R18 is we'll argue and banter all the time even with each other but once we're playing and things get started everyone shuts up and gets to work
Briggs,3bgqua,Wenzington,4,Mon Jun 29 08:38:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of your points my friend. Get an update from axis regarding R18 maybe - Im pretty sure you would change your mind if you would know what happened in the past.   INI, the strongest Miller outfit was palying QRF for them the last match, so I wouldn't execlude a fast and very capable JUGA force as QRF option. But that should not be discussed here - join our TS and tell me your thoughts - would be a pleasure to hear them."
Briggs,3bgqua,Motster101,4,Mon Jun 29 14:55:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks, glad to hear it.   I don't need a update from axis, everything I say is my own opinion. I also know what happened in the past, better than most. As much as Juga could do QRF, we wouldn't be great at it. We are best at setting up caps and holding the point."
Briggs,3bgqua,goots93,4,Mon Jun 29 08:39:26 2015 UTC,Good points.
Briggs,3bgqua,Squiizzy,2,Mon Jun 29 09:07:23 2015 UTC,"RIP also strong contenders for this role, and TCFB are hard workers as well."
Briggs,3bgqua,Havetts,2,Mon Jun 29 09:22:13 2015 UTC,"Hey, not to interfere in your guys' business. But, UFOs BRTD ( 24 people ) were QRF for Miller this time. PLs were encouraged to help out other lanes adjacent to them.  INI was responsible for Eisa lane. ;)  (Im from Miller - I was the VIB SL this SSmash)"
Briggs,3bgqua,ChillyPhilly27,3,Tue Jun 30 08:24:42 2015 UTC,Juga's strength are their point holds. R18's strength is their redeployside. Shouldn't we play outfits according to their strengths? Zes wouldn't ask anyone other than tcfb to be his air reserve
Briggs,3bgqua,DJCzerny,2,Tue Jun 30 00:27:57 2015 UTC,"You are right, just talked about Options and what Miller did. But we are so far away from our next Match plannings. I would still love to hear every single opinion, if you like to inform me about your thoughts."
Briggs,3bgqua,RichiesGhost,2,Mon Jun 29 09:37:36 2015 UTC,"As a friendly outside viewer from Emerald, I'd like to ask why you think you need a dedicated QRF. What goal are they accomplishing? Putting out fires in your territory? If so, you are already playing a losing game because you are dedicating a large portion of your forces to fixing a problem rather than preempting it.   Emerald has run our entire last set of matches without a ""QRF"" force or, more accurately, where everyone is QRF. Assign your forces to a lane and make sure they push that lane. It's up to the leads there to make sure issues are handled or reported to the FC, who should be shifting population accordingly. If you truly are better than your opponents, you should be able to push your lanes 50/50, and no QRF can save every lane at once."
Briggs,3bgqua,DJCzerny,2,Mon Jun 29 09:40:56 2015 UTC,Isn't shifting population basically what QRF is?
Briggs,3bgqua,RichiesGhost,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:32:31 2015 UTC,"QRF, as used by most, is a term for a group that rapidly deploys around the map to quickly provide population to a specific area before redploying out to respond to a different fight. In our case, when you go to a lane, you stay in that lane until the opponent shifts their population in such a way that you need to move elsewhere.  The big difference being that every platoon is assigned a lane that they are expected to win, one way or another. Not wait for the QRF to come along to your lane and push it for you."
Briggs,3bgqua,Cloudy87VS,2,Mon Jun 29 17:50:44 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from however I think the QRF idea holds merit if only to change the flow of battle that much sooner. Take for example Chariot, our harasser squad, who do things such as getting behind enemy lines to destroy sunderers. They sweep in, do what they need to do, and get out so that the friendly forces are in a better position to finish the fight, and they do so in a highly efficient manner with a low opportunity cost compared to having them as infantry players.  Something I recall from the Emerald vs Briggs SS was the role that GOKU played. They didn't seem to be focusing on a particular lane as such but rather going to reinforce lanes where required, and then getting out as soon as they had turned the tides in Emerald's favour. I think that's the sort of thing that's being proposed with QRF - not necessarily to put out fires, but rather to be a dynamic wind which changes how the fires spread so that control is gained that much sooner.   I also think that for it to be truly effective, it needs to be a large scale effort - as you say, everyone in Emerald's lineup was QRF, because no QRF can save every lane at once."

Briggs,3bgqua,Gabba202,3,Tue Jun 30 03:24:05 2015 UTC,"This thread was meant to reactivate our old Briggs passion, but unfortunately it was abused by some people. The usual people…  I never wanted to play Planetside in a serious way, when I joined the game early 2013. I even had a 6 month break after my first days in the game and didn’t cared about Servers or Ping. Somehow I started again and found friends. In different factions and different outfits and at a certain point I decided to stay, despite my bad ping. Today I can say, that I consider Briggs as my first and only Planetside home.   Nero, the last time you talked to me you called me “mate” and told me about your desire of an alliance between R18 and ZE7A. Today you call me an idiot. Your thoughts about you and Picard being Force Commanders is comparable to Osama Bin Ladens desire to be a US president. You think you are hardcore leaders, whereas you prove your inabilities on a daily base on Briggs live. You never played with real leaders and are just a small piece of the shadow of mans like Thirsty, Axis, Ching, Brack and many more. Just a piece of their shadow – nothing more.   You think I’m not able to lead? Still you listen to every single of my request on live Server, because you have no clue what to do otherwise. There are so many people who played under my Command in Briggs, that your statement is only causing a little, derogatory smile in their face.   You think you are somehow the reason why Briggs Reps and other Outfit Leaders consider R18 again? Actually nobody gave a damn shit about your opinion during our briefings and it was me, eating the shit picard and you have left, to reintegrate R18 again in the community. It was me saying to the other outfit leads “Do it for me plz”. It was me putting my head on the dish for all R18 members, without expecting anything in return. And still you and Picard fucked me in the bag the next days.   I had a good talk with Dylan, ZRPExpress and Eagle some days ago in your TS. They are up to date and I beg all R18 members to contact those people, to get an overview of the real story happening in the background. How can you R18 guys still stay under Picards and Neros command? You can find your prove of their inabilities to be community leaders in this single thread and you will find your final prove after your potential talk with Dylan.  With Nero and Picard being major leaders in R18, their behavior the last days will pretty much lead to R18 being completely excluded again – you lost my support at least and that was your own real support during our Outfit leader meetings.   R18 members, if you want to play this game in a constructive and more competitive way – there are more than enough capable Outfits on Briggs – be more open minded.   I won’t reply to any post or pm of you again Nero, but today you dug your final Briggs grave."

Briggs,3bgqua,Motster101,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:43:45 2015 UTC,"Your outfit isn't allowed to participate because your quality members come bundled with your leaders (read: with you.) The Briggs community has nothing against your members. Your outfit leadership, and currently you in particular by a country mile, are problematic, immature, and combative. As long as that persists, it will not be worth the community's time or effort to work with you, and your outfit will continue to suffer for the behaviour of its leaders.  This isn't censorship. This isn't some Orwellian conspiracy by the Powers That Be. You've been excluded because you're a toxic menace. When you play stupid games, you win stupid prizes."
Briggs,3bgqua,DrMcCrank,16,Mon Jun 29 19:17:06 2015 UTC,"Just curious, if certain elements of the outfit are the problem, why not ban those elements only?"
Briggs,3bgqua,SlingingNumber4,2,Tue Jun 30 03:53:59 2015 UTC,"Because their quality members come bundled with their leaders. Most people here have little issue with R18's leaders' squad-and-platoon leading capabilities. The general consensus is that they're somewhere between capable and great at it. To have R18 at the smash, but to exclude its leaders, is to bring more uncoordinated pubs to the reserves list. Those members need to come with the leaders to coordinate them if they're going to come as an outfit. But at the moment, they lose the chance to come as an outfit because those leaders, while competent, are belligerent, and are worth nobody's time to work with.  Being competent is what makes them an asset. Being unable to play well with others is what makes them a hindrance. Until such time as they stop being a big enough hindrance to become a worthwhile asset, the community will continue, rightfully, to tell them to go pound sand."

Briggs,3bgqua,BestAssassinAU2,2,Mon Jun 29 16:58:46 2015 UTC,"I would like to draw to peoples attention here, that this is the state of the bureaucracy on Briggs, a lone kid, with zero experience, or any real track record of long term contributions towards Briggs has, without question or comment, total control over an entire community of players and what they can or cannot do in a server wide event.  .....  By saying this, you have now Banned a portion of the briggs community from the event you do not run.   Perx has not banned anybody from anything. He has no power to do so.  He however recently went out of his way to strongly push his view that R18 should be bought back into the fold. He's not the only one with that view, and there are a number of us who have been bringing it up occasionally to both other outfit leads and server reps for a couple of months now. But recently Perx took it upon himself to be the one to try to make it happen; he was the one who made actual contact with R18 to talk with you, and he was the one who loudly pushed for it during one of our SS meetings. If you turn around and shit-talk the guy who put his neck out there for you the most, and he then withdraws his support because of it, others may well follow his lead.  Sometimes I wonder whether you deliberately sabotage any efforts to bring your outfit and the rest of the community together. It sure feels like it sometimes."

Axis essentially hinted at my question   Sometimes I wonder whether you deliberately sabotage any efforts to bring your outfit and the rest of the community together. It sure feels like it sometimes.   Shapes/Nero, there is no doubt you would be an asset to Briggs Server Smash endeavours.  I have played in your platoons and against your platoons.  It was always a pleasure and a challenge which after all is why we play the game in the first place. There are quite a few outfit leads supporting your inclusion.  Perx just happened to be the one prepared to stick his neck out.    Do you want to be part of Briggs Server Smash?  Do you want R18 to be part of Briggs Server Smash?  I realise the answer to both questions is not necessarily the same. Just curious"

Dude. just stop. stop being a cunt online because its not getting you anywhere and its giving ur outfit a shit rep (may i add, that also left briggs for connery when many still stayed here under the leadership of ur so called ""command structure"").  i dont care about stats so u can try pull that card all u want but i wont really give a shit anyway. but im just commenting on your general reddit etiquette. and i believe im speaking for a lot of people here that genuinely care for this community and those who come on just to see what kind of shit you come up with (even i have to admit its very entertaining at times seeing you desperately pull petty ""refer to this quote"" kinda reasoning, but its more like you amaze me by showing me how much of a cunt someone can be online).

I managed to crack my 27"" monitor back panel in a straight line left to right, dead centre. So now it has a thin white line across the whole screen. It's really affecting my aiming for left to right because I normally just use the single dot scopes. I was trying the blue triangle one on NC yesterday, wasn't too bad, just put persons head in here."

I took to the chevron after seeing it in one of Wrel's videos and found that it works really well for me in either 1x or 2x form. It's easy to aim with and somehow satisfying.  As for your monitor, that would be a hindrance. Maybe go for a cheaper 24 or 23 inch screen in the meantime? I got mine for $180 2-3 years ago so I'm certain that price point still exists."

Don't be afraid to ask questions but don't suck the person's  dick trying to do it. If people want to improve they should take up the offers given to them. The best way to get better is to surround yourself with good players and a positive  mentality.

A playstyle which will pay dividends in SS and PSBL. Casual players looking to get better would be crazy not to take you up on the offer.
Briggs,3bgh21,NZNed,2,Mon Jun 29 01:13:38 2015 UTC,I believe that if casual player spent some time improving with a group . there experience would be much better and would play more often and more regularly

I've said it before, until outfits with active leadership, organisation and a desire to grow their numbers open their squads to the public, the average skill of casual, public players is not going to improve. When was the last time you logged into the game and joined a random pub squad on the list? It's pretty dismal.  We have a crisis of leadership burnout on Briggs.

Ha, thanks for the laugh.  The only bases where you get 80+% with the TR is a ghost cap, because we sure as fuck don't even get equal pop unless we are crushing in an alert.  Maybe if some of the fourth factioners that love their NC farm time would spread out between the TR and VS, we might actually have some battles worth talking about."

But let's put what I'm talking about into perspective I'm talking about squad play and I was not attacking r18's tactics in any way many alert have been won with the help of r18 platoon bombs and is part of the game but this this thread is about low number squad improvement not platoon wide improvement but hey if you wanna have a cry that's fine bring on the popcorn"
Briggs,3bgh21,ChillyPhilly27,-3,Mon Jun 29 04:56:24 2015 UTC,"A large and active community is naturally going to be a larger and more active force in game.   Does everything the small outfits do just larger scale, so my original comment about joining R18 was worth mentioning, what you call cheese are actually well organised team set-plays which are easily able to be defeated with opposing players also using team play.   That's the issue you guys have, you THINK your team players, but in reality your just a group of single players walking about together, massive difference."
Briggs,3bgh21,DefenestrateMyStyle,2,Mon Jun 29 05:03:52 2015 UTC,"A large and active community is naturally going to be a larger and more active force in game.   I would disagree. A small, tight outfit like ISNC, SW2G or JUGA brings more to the table than other 'mass recruiting' outfits. They pretty much only get taken out with large overpop or lots of force multipliers. Up until a certain point, coordination > pure numbers."
Briggs,3bgh21,Ridiculisk1,2,Mon Jun 29 05:25:18 2015 UTC,"Ridiculisk, I have to agree with Shapes on this one - they aren't the usual mass recruiting outfit.  Their dagger squads (I think that's what they used to call them, not so sure what they call them now) are highly coordinated ""commando"" teams, with the rest of their platoon(s) filled out with more casual, less experienced players. (Also generally, and sometimes mistakenly, called the zerg.)  Don't mistake what they are capable of, when they want to."

Briggs,3bgh21,kurosan,2,Mon Jun 29 02:32:29 2015 UTC,"No need to get defensive, I was just stating my opinion. Not everything is a personal attack against you. Please remind me where I mentioned R18 in my post.   If outfits like JUGA or SW2G were the size of outfits like TROL, they would simply take the entire map. Those outfits have extreme levels of personal skill and coordination on their side, they're only constrained by numbers, which happens to be the way to beat them. I have seen many, many fights where we couldn't wipe a JUGA squad off a point with 80% hex pop. Mass recruitment outfits can't quite do that.   Everyone is free to play the game in any way they want, but saying that large outfits bring more to the game than small, coordinated outfits is I think naive."
Briggs,3bgh21,kurosan,12,Mon Jun 29 02:52:08 2015 UTC,"I'll just jump right in here and remind you of when you scrimmed us in a controlled, small ops environment.  As I recall it our biggest problem was staggering our redeoplys when we ran out of ammo.  You do what you do, we do what we do. We choose not to do what you do, but you can't do what we do."
Briggs,3bgh21,DefenestrateMyStyle,9,Mon Jun 29 03:38:53 2015 UTC,It's extremely difficult to simultaneously increase numbers and maintain quality of players.  00 is probably the only outfit that's ever done it well

Briggs,3bgh21,crushdepth5thFaction,3,Mon Jun 29 03:05:33 2015 UTC,"It results in lower average skill. Not saying large outfits can't have good players (in fact, all the large outfits on Briggs have a lot of really good players), but if you just recruit everyone who can find your outfit in the list, then your average player skill will be lower than if you had stringent entry requirements.   Again, not flinging shit at any outfits in particular, but there is a clear difference between an outfit like AC and an outfit like AOD."

R18 may help non members experience the game, but you're hardly a ""small commando style team"" are you..   So we do everything small outfits do plus more.   Really? When? In the past few weeks I've seen R18 at quite a few fights, none where you faced uphill odds"
Briggs,3bgh21,BUnit3,11,Mon Jun 29 06:02:47 2015 UTC,"That's because our commanders focus on fights that are in our favor   You mean, where you have pop advantage?   R18 choosing their fights in this manner doesn't upset me in the slightest; but going around calling yourself a crack, punch-above-your-weight team is just a blatant lie   I assure you there are equal numbers of fights we lose or win heavily out numbered.   So you say, but where's the proof? To be completely honest it's rare to see R18 at a 50/50 fight let alone out-popped"
Briggs,3bgh21,Ilandar,6,Mon Jun 29 04:40:29 2015 UTC,That's because our commanders focus on fights that are in our favor.    Choosing the path of least resistance makes sense if you want to look good but it doesn't always win alerts and certainly doesn't reflect the SS experience

Briggs,3bgh21,TheSwifttt,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:08:21 2015 UTC,"No not those ones, I'm talking about the outfits that zerg under the guise of 'tactical play'. You will see them on most nights, they group up, and take bases with 70+% pop, then move onto the next. When you go to take back the base, they can't retake the base at a 50/50 fight. If you let them go, they warpgate you, leaving you to ghost cap everything back because there are no other fights, so plenty of people just log off."

Most are either big outfits that only ever zerg, or small ones that don't have the numbers to run more than a couple of squads.

Briggs,3bgh21,TheFullCologne,7,Mon Jun 29 03:05:03 2015 UTC,"I saw evidence of R18's team play the other day actually, it was quite a sight to behold.  Picard was running out the front in his MAX. He had four engineers behind him with their rep guns running at all times and behind them was a team of two or three medics that were ressing the engineers constantly because they weren't wearing full flak and kept dying when we fired decis at Picard. Now I have to admit, it was quite hilarious to see but was extremely effective. He had a lot of people shooting at him and despite the occasional retreat so he could get fully repped again, it took quite a while for him to get taken down.   I'm not sure if it was the most efficient usage of manpower since it was only one shotgun MAX doing the shooting and the rest of the squad had their engi/medic tools out, but it certainly explains why his K/D is so high."

Briggs,3bgh21,BUnit3,3,Wed Jul 1 04:56:36 2015 UTC,"Then why hasn't our play been punishing that?  SS is equal overall pop, everytime they dump numbers on one base, they must be under pop somewhere else."
Briggs,3bgh21,CassiusDean,2,Mon Jun 29 07:51:16 2015 UTC,"But it's the co-ordinating the timing of the dumping and the redeploying that sets a good leader apart from the rest. Let them have 48-96 80+% pop in a hex with a 7 minute cap. Gives you time to put your forces to use on other bases, then get them back to the fight to push them off point and save the day."
Briggs,3bgh21,BUnit3,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:01:30 2015 UTC,"Yes there must be underpop somewhere else. They dumped 3 platoons on our base that we were capping, we looked at the map and nobody had pushed out to cap somewhere else where there was low pop. When we had overpopped a base the platoons there struggled to regain the base with 65-70% pop and at that time the other team were pushing other lanes where we pulled out to save a base. So yes we had been punished and lost SS because of it."
Briggs,3bgh21,jf9,5,Mon Jun 29 04:48:31 2015 UTC,"we looked at the map and nobody had pushed out to cap somewhere else where there was low pop   So many times i'd look at the map, saw us resecuring a base and not start a cap on the next.."
Briggs,3bgh21,XCVJoRDANXCV,5,Mon Jun 29 01:07:24 2015 UTC,do you think ss opponents will shy away from cheese?
Briggs,3bgh21,PowerDown1,5,Mon Jun 29 01:30:20 2015 UTC,"Yes because resources run out and you don't have a cont bonus. You can't chain pull maxes, battle gals and fury buses in SS. In the end it comes down to fundamentals."
Briggs,3bgh21,TheFullCologne,3,Mon Jun 29 01:49:13 2015 UTC,"Someone forgot to tell Miller this on Saturday night, I've never seen so many maxs constantly pulled at every base. Their infantry players overall seemed less skilled than other servers we have come up against. It was the amount of maxs they always had, along with support to keep them up, that kept us from taking bases like Pale Canyon, alongside the fact they always had a small group of libs and battle sundys killing the multiple sundys we always had there."
Briggs,3bgh21,PowerDown1,2,Mon Jun 29 01:51:10 2015 UTC,"I was watching the stream and the commentators noticed that although Miller were using a shitload of MAX suits early on, after a while they reduced it to only a couple at each base (which was probably when their resources started running low)."
Briggs,3bgh21,XCVJoRDANXCV,3,Mon Jun 29 02:04:20 2015 UTC,"I think they also knew when and where to pull maxs. It wasn't just a case of, hey let's pull a shitload of maxs at every base for every occasion, like we see on Briggs live. They used pounders and the effectiveness of the TR anti-infantry guns to lay down suppressing fire at the right bases, in the right doorways. They had everyone stand back while infils emp'd a room before they breached, not after like some of our guys were doing. They had HA's and LA's running nade bandolier, not like our guys that must have ASC or nanoweave, because that's what they do on live."
Briggs,3bgh21,BUnit3,3,Mon Jun 29 05:04:20 2015 UTC,"It wasn't just maxes, they were more organized in every way, namely use of EMPs."
Briggs,3bgh21,Shepherd336,3,Mon Jun 29 02:19:22 2015 UTC,"Hats off to them, their use of nades was far superior to ours, more co-ordinated and used in a proper manner."
Briggs,3bgh21,TheFullCologne,2,Mon Jun 29 04:46:14 2015 UTC,"Yup. We simply got outplayed, especially on logistics.  From an air POV it seemed like Miller always had more ground/AA assets in play than Briggs did."

Briggs,3bdycb,Squiizzy,0,Sun Jun 28 22:04:03 2015 UTC,Roger that.
Briggs,3bdycb,GoatsCheese2,5,Sun Jun 28 21:37:07 2015 UTC,"We should do a live ""briggsmash"" and delegate a TR FC and NC FC. Decide on which alert to do, then smash it out for 2 hours.  That way you dont overpop either faction and dont need to do any form of invasion on another server which would kill primetime ops on Briggs. The invasions on other servers arent that great purely because we rarely get more than a platoon in these events."
Briggs,3bdycb,SOCA-TrolliN,2,Sun Jun 28 14:01:05 2015 UTC,Problem is irregular Alert times. Could just arrange a communal start time. Record starting territory or something then the end time % though even then it will not really show a winner.  That being said if people just want to do it to improve and for the love of the game it would be a great idea to fight hard for 2 hours at an agreed upon time regardless of uneven populations
Briggs,3bdycb,GoatsCheese2,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:40:18 2015 UTC,mmmmm alerts start quite frequently so you could just decide on the alert closest to say 8pm AEST sunday or something like that. You'd wait only an hour tops for the next alert these days.
Briggs,3bdycb,GoatsCheese2,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:33:47 2015 UTC,The only problem i see with that is it punishes the VS pubs who likely would be oblivious and certain outfits that don't want to participate. That's why ultimately i would like to see all three factions involved in it. I know SS is usually 1v1 but having to be wary of multiple factions should improve the FCs skills faster than a 1v1 imo.
Briggs,3bdycb,RichiesGhost,2,Sun Jun 28 22:14:02 2015 UTC,"3 factions would be good, but I'm not sure if we have the pop to spread our forces across all 3 factions so that the FC can effectively command more than a platoon (to better simulate SS). If we go TR/NC (or VS/NC TR/VS) we can just fight on the lanes that correspond to either faction and ignore the faction left out, kinda like a lanesmash."
Briggs,3bdycb,GoatsCheese2,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:36:36 2015 UTC,"If you do that then it will lead to one of the two participating factions getting tag teamed. It's not as though one faction is just going to sit it out whilst the other two are fighting with one another.  Besides, if you want to simulate SS you have to fight on multiple fronts. Even if you can't get more than one platoon going (which really, you should given there will be about 100+ people on each faction) you can at least have the FC's directing multiple independent squads."
Briggs,3bdycb,RichiesGhost,2,Mon Jun 29 01:05:40 2015 UTC,"What would be a better alternative to a live briggsmash?  1) Invasion on another server? We rarely get more than a platoon for these events based on past attempts, and people don't get grouped into their respective outfit squads due to the pure lack of participants. Furthermore, their off-peak hours arent that much higher than ours in terms of population. On top of that you have the faction stacking issue.  2) Jaegar briggsmash requires a shitload of organisation (accounts, setting up maps, bookings). A briggsmash on live literally requires players to login and platoon up on the night. Very easy to organise."
Briggs,3bdycb,GoatsCheese2,2,Mon Jun 29 05:20:03 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I agree, a live Briggsmash is the way to go. If nothing else I think it's the best option for the health of our server.   The problem is that it's live. You're going to have enough problems organising two factions to take part in it, especially when there will be pubs doing whatever they want on the day, to be able to write off a third faction. Granted, you could let the third faction ghost cap the continent and that might take some of the pubs off your back, but then that means that a third of our SS forces aren't going to be able to take part in the practice unless they fourth faction, in if they fourth faction they don't get to utilise loadouts as they would in an actual SS.  Most importantly though, what would you say has been the biggest issue in our past three SS? From my pov, it's not being able to coordinate and mobilise forces, leading to sluggish responses and always being on the backfoot. If you've got two factions pushing one or two lanes then it's just going to turn into a farm. Throw in a third faction and all of a sudden things are unbalanced with multiple lanes being pushed on multiple fronts, leading to the kinds of conditions we need to play in to overcome our greatest SS weaknesses."
Briggs,3bdycb,RichiesGhost,2,Mon Jun 29 07:26:15 2015 UTC,"The third faction almost adds that extra dimension of macromanagement that would be required to hold territory as an FC.  You're right that is one of the biggest issues in our SS team atm, but lanesmash doesn't practise that, a proper biggsmash requires too much effort to practise that on a weekly basis and a connery invasion doesn't generate enough interest to effectively split outfit squads and seems more like a social platoon bomb."
Briggs,3bdycb,Livingthepunlife,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:00:48 2015 UTC,"Realistically we don't need to have everyone competing in a full on Briggsmash to train up our FC's, we just need to have an FC working with each faction as often as we can so that they can get experience with being an FC."
Briggs,3bdycb,RichiesGhost,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:28:34 2015 UTC,"I think it would be fine if it is even a hundred on each faction. Chances are they will stay in their outfit squads/platoons and not group  up which means the FC(s) get experience at commanding the bigger platoons and also the squads. 100 people is still over 8 squads, plenty to get a feel for and fine tune Force Commanding skills, in my opinion anyway."
Briggs,3bdycb,XCVJoRDANXCV,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:26:58 2015 UTC,"Nah, the VS would take the place of the Black Ops thingy and just sabotage fights at random"
Briggs,3bdycb,PeRXeRs,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:32:18 2015 UTC,"I find your lack of faith in the VS pubs... amusing.  TAW8 usually runs ops with two squads on Sunday nights from 7:30AEST so we could probably get them to FC. DENT is usually around as well, TROL could easily be convinced, WOLF will probably be there, and GunR will no doubt be feeding out PS2 addictions. I'm not sure about EDGE, OMY, SW2G, FCLM, and TCFB but chances are there will be a few of them online as well.  Assuming my internets is (finally) connected I will run a pub platoon and do what I can to get command chat going."
Briggs,3bdycb,XCVJoRDANXCV,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:59:24 2015 UTC,"Its not a lack of faith its that it is literally indefeasible to expect a whole faction to play on alts or not log in. There are a lot of casual players out there who will have no idea this is going on and in my opinion it would be rude to impose our game style on them, rather i am proposing we work around these players and have a weekly three-way during the hours of 8-10pm AEST on a Sunday. It would be good if someone could arrange a similar thing to happen on the VS and TR (which i know used to run a similar thing and probably still have the stuff set in place for it to happen again)."

Briggs,3bdycb,paziggie,2,Sun Jun 28 12:06:21 2015 UTC,Well i am happy for any other TR outfits to join us on a Sunday. We ops 6:30-8:30. Welcome to just sit in the command channel and listen to where our outfit is heading and see us on the map if that is all you want from this rather than the old Tr warcouncil thing. As i have never read ingame chat and have most ingame channels muted Soca has become a little disconected. Just something to know outfits movement be nice.
Briggs,3bdycb,MikeHonchoYou,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:25:23 2015 UTC,"I think that 6:30 PM is a little early for a lot of outfits. If we just organize it that on a Sunday night, participating outfit leaders join the communal TS whenever they're on with other outfit leaders and they coordinate their forces over the map together.   This way there's no reliance on other outfits at all. It's whoever shows up on the night.  And in addition, if an outfit only has say a few players on one night, we could merge them with another, smaller outfit and deploy them as a combined outfit squad.   It gets us used to playing together outside of our own outfits and hopefully gives us a more diverse playing style."

Briggs,3bd1zi,Livingthepunlife,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:49:11 2015 UTC,I watched parts of the stream and must have missed something. What's up with that random TR owned base in the middle of NC land?
Briggs,3bd1zi,RichiesGhost,2,Sun Jun 28 11:37:15 2015 UTC,"same for the Briggs vs Miller smash, that one was not allowed to be capped, have terminals hacked etc. but was allowed to be passed through"
Briggs,3bd1zi,farazelleth,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:12:16 2015 UTC,"Wait, did Cobalt start at the Northern warpgate? I remember hearing something about the north WG being a little bit more advantageous.  Or it could just be down to a team of newbies."
Briggs,3bd1zi,JIM7S,4,Sun Jun 28 05:49:06 2015 UTC,"The North-Western WG is hugely advantageous, making the SS map unbalanced as:   NW and South warp gates have the same flight times (give or take 2-5 seconds) to Andvari Southbank and Nott Research Camp - if you're coming from the NW, you can (theoretically) prevent the south from capping those bases, and stop them from getting into Andvari Biolab and Nott Amp Station to begin with. Within the space of ten minutes of the match starting, you can have a Biolab, an Amp Station, and most of the satellite bases. From there, you can push down to Jaeger's Crossing, Ymir Biolab, and Waterson's Redemption; Pale Canyon links up to Mattherson's triumph and Waterson's Redemption. Mattherson's is a lot harder to take than Waterson's, so the advantage on that is in the North's favour as well. Realistically, you could pull out of Pale Canyon after a few minutes of the match, reinforce a push elsewhere (i.e. Saerro) and the worst that will happen is that you have exposed Mattherson's and the Andvari satellite next door whilst forcing a more meaningful base through; A lot of the bases on the southern side are easy to capture compared to the Northern side as they're easy to spawn camp, and easyish to  defend sundies, whereas sunderer positions in the North are exposed from long rang tanks and the A-points are more spawn-room accessible; Most of the Esamir fighting during alerts is in the Nott Research to Ymir Biolab lattice, the Andvari Biolab to Waterson's lattice, the bases around Andvari Biolab, and the bases surrounding the Tech Plant - basically if you're coming from the NW and pushing into the south, you're fighting at bases that you're used to fighting at whereas if you're pushing into the north from the south there isn't the same sort of familiarity"
Briggs,3bd1zi,RichiesGhost,2,Sun Jun 28 08:13:41 2015 UTC,imho I wanted to fight from the Southern Warpgate because I felt it was stronger but you guys won the coin toss and picked it.... thats when we picked TR because .... you like it so we want it :D
Briggs,3bd1zi,MikeHonchoYou,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:16:02 2015 UTC,"You're not the only one, both Connery and Cobalt FC's wanted south. Ghost was disappointed when he lost the coin toss and got stuck with north."

Briggs,3bay8v,coolfire1080P,-12,Sat Jun 27 14:38:02 2015 UTC,"Ok ima say this i left the last SS because of a very incompetent platoon leader, he pulled us back to warp gate to organize the platoon and change people around (do it on the fly you fucken moron). However this individual is high up in Briggs command. secondly my Squad leader didn't know what he was doing Briggs vs Connery.   Rest of briggs had a go at me for this but tbh i dont give a rats arse. If you get people who just stay in TS3 channels all day and play high admin all day and then get them to lead squads platoons or even fc the SS then fuck your an incompetant idiot!!!   Why the fuck not use people who actually lead in game or do it often instead of guys who used to lead. Squizzy is good at leading however he does not lead as often as he once did nor is he in game constantly enough to be at a level that should be acceptable to be fc for a SS and tbh half of you guys should not be FCing or platoon leading for SS. You may not want to hear it or like it. But quess what 3 big losses in a row means wake the fuck up briggs high command!!   As a person in leadership positions you should be able to accept that you are doing something wrong and changing it not just threatening to ban people from the Briggs TS3 for saying the truth 5scott. But then again those with power will abuse it even when everything is going wrong. Because who wants to give up power ? if your in power do you want to hear something that you don't like no you don't but in the real world Leader's do!   I will say this Sexypillows for fc Picard for FC fuck it give unblessed fc. People who lead whole platoons and know the maps and the changed and play constanlty. As well as can adapt to changing streatergies.   Until you guys actually learn that guys who play admin all day and tell people off for being bad little kids in a teamspeak should not be the fucken platoon leaders or FC's. But until that time we briggs will lose constantly over and over again. Ps i am briggs biggest shit stirrer but idc i will say the honest truth wenever you like it or not. You can say the same about me because quess what i know i have failing's and area's we are not as strong on unlike your selves... So man up take defeat and find some guys who actually lead in game or ima LAWLAWLLAWLAWLLAWL at briggs high command till they eventually find a new game to play high admin rulers for."

On the plus side, a punishment is something which reduces the likelihood of a behaviour and so I imagine that this punishment will reduce the likelihood of people rage quitting in future SS (and saying that it was due to anything other than their game/internet crashing)"
Briggs,3bay8v,RichiesGhost,2,Sat Jun 27 17:19:49 2015 UTC,"If we want to do well in the upcoming tournament, we need to be bringing less zerglings, not more. We'd be better off downgrading numbers than encouraging outfits like hmmr, ice or omy to bring multiple squads"
Briggs,3bay8v,ChillyPhilly27,2,Sat Jun 27 20:39:44 2015 UTC,We downgraded from 288 to 240 in the last couple of SS.  How has that worked out for us?
Briggs,3bay8v,RichiesGhost,3,Sun Jun 28 02:30:52 2015 UTC,"We beat emerald (the first time) with 240. Same with connery and the 3-way. The only reason why we upgraded to 288 at the last minute for the first Miller match was because of excessive interest by the community.   And there's the crux of the issue right there. A large proportion of our high tier players and outfits have simply lost interest in playing. Gab and shok didn't even field squads this time, and a full third of rsnc's commitment were refugees from other outfits.   This isn't a problem that we can solve by pouring in more shitters to fill the gap. When you do that you get the sort of result that happened to connery a few hours after we finished"
Briggs,3bay8v,ChillyPhilly27,2,Sun Jun 28 02:54:13 2015 UTC,"Fair point then, though what do you think will happen if Emerald only gets to bring 200 of their people to play because we want to stack the decks with our burnt-out best? The more we limit their numbers, the more they get to stack their decks and blame us for the privilege.   If zerglings are the cause of our defeats, then we should train them not to zerg and/or we should make use of their zerging capabilities by putting them in support roles (i.e. engineer turrets to lockdown doorways, sunderer deployment and destruction)"
Briggs,3bay8v,RichiesGhost,0,Sun Jun 28 03:05:35 2015 UTC,"Even if we put these zerglings in ""support roles"" (which would require them to be integrated into other outfit's squads) they're still going to be less effective than the competent players that others will bring.   Maybe it's just time that we acknowledged that we simply don't have the talent pool to compete with servers with 4-5 times our pop. As is we're bringing the top 70-80% of our outfits, and close to 90% of our decent players. As our top end becomes more inactive, we can either downsize, bring more pubs and lose every match, or try to bring our mid and low level outfits up to a higher standard"
Briggs,3bay8v,ChillyPhilly27,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:35:57 2015 UTC,The numbers issue most probably tied to our server performance as well.  Everyone wanted in when we were winning and after 2 losses we started struggling to get people.  I can only assume that less active or retired players are only interested to give up their time if they think we'll win. It's sad but not unexpected
Briggs,3bay8v,DefenestrateMyStyle,2,Sun Jun 28 04:13:07 2015 UTC,"It is. I remember talking to Scott just after the 3 way back in November. For some reason, we had plenty of sign ups for our first match, very few for the one against emerald (which we were expected to lose) and then far too many for the 3 way and against Miller"

Briggs,3bay8v,MarshyFromAUS,-1,Sun Jun 28 04:05:57 2015 UTC,Salty rage or points for consideration?
Briggs,3bay8v,CAMIKAZE78,7,Sat Jun 27 16:37:42 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but one of the core factors that makes a good leader is their ability to stick it out to the end with their troops. How can Gunza possibly offer advice on leading if he can't land that core point home?"
Briggs,3bay8v,RichiesGhost,6,Sat Jun 27 16:45:57 2015 UTC,"Gunza's personality and abilities as a leader are irrelevant when it comes to deciding whether or not his arguments have merit as authority does not determine if an argument is valid.  Rather than looking at the name attached to the arguments, look at the arguments themselves:   In SS, the leaders should be people who lead in game on a regular basis as they are at the required level; The leaders shouldn't be people who used to lead as they are no longer at the required level;  The required level is knowing the maps, the changes to PS2, and the ability to adapt to changing strategies;    So the question is, regardless of the source, does the argument hold merit? If the answer is yes to all of the following, then it does:   Do we require SS leaders who know the maps? Do we require SS leaders who know the changes that have been made to PS2? Do we require SS leaders who have the ability to adapt to changing strategies? Do 'current' leaders possess the abovementioned knowledge and abilities? Do 'past' leaders fail to possess the abovementioned knowledge and abilities?"
Briggs,3bay8v,eriman,2,Sat Jun 27 17:18:16 2015 UTC,Skill and experience is irrevocably attached to individuals. I believe you're incorrectly applying ad hominem considering one of the reasons people have problems with his opinion on leadership are certain facets of his personality which they consider detrimental to his leadership.   That's a good checklist for potential FC candidates though.
Briggs,3bay8v,RichiesGhost,3,Sat Jun 27 20:07:54 2015 UTC,"Gunza's argument isn't that he is a good leader, it's that we need good leaders for SS. His ability as a leader is irrelevant when it comes to determining if that's true."
Briggs,3bay8v,eriman,2,Sun Jun 28 01:48:24 2015 UTC,"it's that we need good leaders for SS   That is a truism, you really can't base an argument off it because no-one needs convincing on that score. You've got a good argument for what makes a good FC because it details in specifics what checklist FC candidates need to go through.   But I'm not surprised people will question his opinion when the extent of his argument so far is that people who ""spend time on Teamspeak playing High Admin instead of running platoons"" shouldn't get FC."

I love those guys in red, but you're just a fucking fuck mate.  I don't mind how legitimate your opinion is, have some fucking tact. You're in the bad books because you act like an idiot.

Briggs,3bay8v,fivecott,20,Sat Jun 27 19:45:19 2015 UTC,"Gunza You bailed cause you didn't like how things were going. Of course you pulled back to warpgate to organize. You were in an AIR PLATOON.  As for the kick you were not being constructive. If you had of paused for a moment you would have heard a lot of constructive criticism towards a lot of people and nobody was buthurt over it. Know what the difference was with you? You were just being insulting. Nothing constructive. The first words out of your mouth were literally ""Squiizzy is a shitcunt"". You were taking the chance to put the boot in to someone you have a personal dislike for. So fuck right off  As for your whole tirade about admining all day . . . Guess what? I was not in a position of command. None of the reps were. We know we are not the ones best able to lead large groups of people so on game day we VOLUNTEER our time to manage subs and make sure all the people who ARE good at that stuff have a chance to do it. The community decides who it will follow into any match. Not us. That person then gets to select their platoon leaders from a pool of those who have stood up. If you don't like it step up yourself rather than just running away when you get told something you disagree with  So rather than pussy out when you don't like what is happening be a man and stand up to do it yourself. People like you are always willing to shit on those who are willing to stand up but are never willing to do it themselves.  So you keep LAWLAWLAWing from the background while being unwilling to see ONE match to the end"

For me to see 4 skyguards firing in the air with real people driving them, supporting another 40 dudes flying planes who are preparing to mow down infantry trying to kill a small group of friendlies hugging walls for cover.   Only thing that comes close is strategy games where you click and move a unit, this is real people utilizing their talents.   This last match even though we lost was for me the most challenging game I've been in and even though there are many headaches and lost sleep preparing for it its just amazing working with so many different groups all at the same time.  Its the challenge of competition, not the ego boosting win that drives me, because a win without competition doesn't feel like a win."
Briggs,3bchug,Zesurov,3,Sat Jun 27 23:28:45 2015 UTC,It's the PVP of real time strategy and in SS or what ever format supports organised continent fighting... just makes the game what it was meant to be at a high tier level of competition (regardless of player execution during the game).   That makes it that much more awesome- just wanted to agree with your point that the game has a great effect of spectacle when you realise it is/can be an RTS involving all human interactions.

I have a platoon at my disposal, doing several different roles, and with good timing in the air i can be called a hero in an instant, so my experience would be way different to anyone else, but i still wanted to put forward why it keeps me around."
Briggs,3bchug,Miniappolis,9,Sun Jun 28 09:02:11 2015 UTC,"SS was great at first, the game actually had meaning again. We performed well as a server, still had room to improve, and I think we decided that what we were doing was good enough, and probably didn't try to improve enough. Meanwhile, the other servers stepped things up a notch.  Last nights SS felt so much better than the previous 2, and despite still losing, it was a far more enjoyable experience. The downside for me on a personal level, is how frustrating it is trying to play with that much ping. The 1v1 engagements are just so much more difficult to win when it feels like you have to sink 1.5x the amount of bullets into someone than you would have to on live."
Briggs,3bchug,PeRXeRs,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:10:30 2015 UTC,"Still trying to clear the air, did we play as Connery? Cause all I can see on the main subreddit is a Cobalt VS Connery SS. And then I come here to a new shitstorm.   Ninja edit: no wait we were up against Miller. Gotcha."

In the previous 2 SS's, the majority of my deaths were from the air. They had the dominance and we got showered in shit from bulldog gals, libs, and esfs. This match, I only died twice to banshees, but easily more than half my deaths on the ground were to maxs. I even tried to use the Archer to take out maxs from range, which is super effective on live, but they had so many engies that the damage did nothing."

Briggs,3bb5cu,Cloudy87VS,4,Sat Jun 27 23:28:32 2015 UTC,"Here's what I think.  Haven't been involved in earlier planning, but there needs to be more specific roles and more people assigned to them- mobile AA, valk-infil-harassing squads, dedicated sundy busters (valk drops or armor depending), car squad, logistic-gals-attached-to-FC (paired with having all squads having an open spot is killer. PM me if you want my thoughts about this)* and about 2-4 squads of QRF. Almost all servers have a QRF, any reason why we don't have our own dedicated one?  note: I'm not saying the platoons should not take the intiative to get their own AA/infils/sundy busting drops up, it's just it's always easier to have dedicated roles.  All these multiple smaller-squad 'support' roles that support the 'primary' roles (the platoons) should be the ones controlled by the FC/FO/whatever you wanna call it.  Platoons should not be jumping around. QRF should be jumping around. You need to take some people off the platoons, chuck them in QRF. Separate smaller numbers are easier to control, but at the same time is more complex. This is where the FC should come in- controlling multiple small support squads, not telling whole platoons to panic redeploy halfway across the map :/  Again, I haven't been involved in planning, it's not a bash against other FC's- it's just what I've noticed from my observations and talking to people."
Briggs,3bb5cu,AsianMuffinBriggs,3,Sat Jun 27 22:22:48 2015 UTC,This is pretty much exactly what I want.  Half our players should be fine to push their areas without being ordered to redeploy.  That's what the other half is for.
Briggs,3bb5cu,AzureProdigy,6,Sun Jun 28 04:09:42 2015 UTC,Don't mean to insult any FC's btw.  Just think the role of FC hasn't been working for us lately and would like us to try something new.
Briggs,3bb5cu,AdamFox01,4,Sat Jun 27 15:12:54 2015 UTC,Well I've not read all of this(there's a lot and its late) but from what I can see your general gist is very similar to what happens anyway. The fc is more or less a glorified map watcher. Now each one does things a little different but generally that's the agreeded upon method.
Briggs,3bb5cu,Gryphon0468,2,Sat Jun 27 15:24:18 2015 UTC,"But we MUST change the title because THAT WILL FIX EVERYTHING!  But in seriousness i totally agree thats whats happening. Or should be, at least."
Briggs,3bb5cu,BUnit3,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:55:11 2015 UTC,"lol.  This coming from the outfit that had PPA harassers shooting and running over friendlies.  We need an FC. Scott actually did a fairly good job, considering the previous commander especially."
Briggs,3bb5cu,paziggie,5,Sat Jun 27 16:31:18 2015 UTC,"8 participants 22 tks 12 participants 46 tks  We grabbed two PPA harassers to jump into Waterson's when it was overflowing with enemy infantry.  Drove past a friendly sundy on the way and ran over an unrendered friendly.  My bad.  If our current system doesn't seem to be working, what's the harm in trying a new system?  My squad personally was upset at losing Eisa after our hard work at the beginning with GUNR and the rest of our platoon holding that balcony for as long as we did, not to mention defending when they had the SCU overloaded too.  Feels like things haven't changed much after the last two debriefs despite the same things being raised about backcaps and such.  I think that that issue is because any squad that is supposed to be doing them becomes ordered to be part of a pop-crash on the bigger fights, and then never manages to get their independence/initiative back to be able to constantly have the backcaps in motion.  Isn't insanity just repeating the same thing again and again and hoping for a different outcome?  Why not try something new?  It really isn't like we have anything to lose at this point."

Briggs,3bb5cu,N7jpicards,0,Sun Jun 28 02:02:50 2015 UTC,"Several bases had PPA harassers just wildly shooting into the crowd, normally the VS crowd. There is nothing more annoying than friendly fire taking down your overshield and some of your health because they aren't looking at the map for where the enemies are, or the Q key on their keyboard isn't working. So you take a few hits, then run out of the way into a TR guy that gets an easy kill on you.  The same can be said for EMP's. Their use of EMPS's was really good. They co-ordinated spam of a couple before the heavies would breach a room. On our team, some of us would breach and be under fire while the guys behind us were hitting us with EMP's, helping to cause our deaths."
Briggs,3bb5cu,AdamFox01,2,Mon Jun 29 00:26:55 2015 UTC,"I know our squad pulled PPA only a couple of times (Chris is our resident harasser abuser), and when we did it was because there were overwhelming infantry to come up against. It was a matter of a squad of 8 trying to do as much damage as possible to a platoon of enemies, with some in the squad engaging the infantry with spam while the others in the squad took down the sunderers."

Briggs,3b9zqu,Floppychicken45,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:55:56 2015 UTC,"The release of Planetside 2 on Playstation 4 has probably had an effect on numbers. Looks like theres PS4 US and Europe servers dont see a mention of an Australian one though, so I guess if you do choose to move over to the PS4 youd be playing on a US server. I guess that and the game has been out a while so people would just naturally drop off cos of that too. I guess most people are still playing cos theres nothing equivalent/better than Planetside 2 to move on to. Ahh also if there are any game developers out there needing ideas better for me would be better graphics, similar game idea though but maybe we could leave the planet or something and Oculus Rift stuff for sure. I guess its starting to sound like the promises we've been given for Star Citizen down the track so I guess thats what Ill move on to??"
Briggs,3b9zqu,DudeMcKill1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:32:24 2015 UTC,release on the PS4 has had some effect  But after playing it on PS4 i have to the conclusion the PC version is far superior and not even talking about performance here.  for example having no australian server sucks but is understandable and unless you make a american PSN you cant play on US servers so AUS PSN only get the option of EU servers.  If that wasnt bad enough NO platoons on PS4 or outfits (although I heard they are trying to patch that in at some point). not to mention many things on PS4 seem to be BR locked for example when you first start PS2 on PS4 you only have a two classes available (heavy and LA) and can only spawn flash until you get to the required BR to use the other vehicles.  Only good thing the PS4 version of PS2 has going for it is that being a spawn room hero could not be better in that going to a 1-12 fight against a 96+ zerg is actually fun since 90 percent of those players will run towards your spawn room or ignore the teleporter room meaning easy kills with what ever gun.
Briggs,3b9zqu,mblades,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:08:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info on what PS2 is like on PS4. Was interested to know. Sounds ok but definitely not as good as the PC version by the sounds and no outfits that sux but I guess you can play in a squad right?? And unlocking classes as you progress through the BR's sounds a bit sucky.
Briggs,3b9zqu,DudeMcKill1,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:59:47 2015 UTC,yeah you can play in a squad but unlike the PC version where it display your entire squad in the bottom of your screen including names the PS4 version you cant tell whos in your squad (unless they speak) so pub squads are far worse.  Basically if I was going to start a new character I rather do it on PC since I get more to work with. sure BR ranks are easy to rank up but using a controller is far more annoying that I thought.  Also the map screen although makes sense with the controller feels like it takes too much time to use a controller to navigate the map instead of using a mouse/keyboard combinations.   Still if you prefer controller or dont have a good PC to run/play PS2 than I guess PS4 is good in that regard but like I said no australian servers only 4 US servers and 2 EU servers on the PS4 (which are region locked)
Briggs,3b9zqu,mblades,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:44:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you're saying, BUT!!  The reason PS2 has failed a bit is 'cos of how it has turned out. A lot of players are PS1 veterans, and have left since the game has turned into a FPS rather than what PS1 was (or some of). I personally would love it if PS2 takes on some of the PS1 features. The devs need to stop making all the new little gimicks, and get on with resources phase 2, and actually make the game what their original plan was."
Briggs,3b9zqu,NewZealandCurrency,2,Sat Jun 27 06:43:43 2015 UTC,"It's failing because the development is shit.  Compare the wreck that is PS2 development with that of Frontier / Elite Dangerous - they have a clear plan, make steady progress against it, everything is announced in advance through a regular newsletter and they actively seek community feedback.  Daebreak needs to get rid of some people, frankly. Their process is shit and their product is easily the most buggy game I've ever played. They've had years to sort it out and uts still fucked. GG."

It's tough to say who runs the best pub platoon on TR, but there almost always is a pub platoon going with a mixture of HMMR, RDBK, BOTM, JUGA, RIP, ICE and SOCA leading them. Really depends what kind of playstyle you're after. Easy going relax-a-thon, or play the objective kind of thing.

I'm kind of interested to see how the Revenant compares.    As for the directive ARs, I've not really heard any good feedback. They seem to feel that whacking HVA on guns, especially guns it doesn't synergize with (i.e. SMGs/guns with 1 tier of damage drop-off) is a good idea..

Briggs,3b1ip6,TheFullCologne,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:13:32 2015 UTC,Sucks to see that NC directive medic weapon gauss prime is just as bad as the TR directive medic weapon (T1A Unity) as to which is worse its probably a tie to be honest.   Only issue I have with directive weapons is the lack of customization like the weapons you start/cert into. Where as the directive weapons are either you like the attachments on it or despise since its not the playstyle you would use with this weapon.   Honestly I feel like directive weapons should have access to all attachments or maybe allow us to put more than 3 attachments on a gun or something unique instead of heres this gun hope you like it approach.

You defender her because of how he spoke, which is fine, but as I understand it, he uploaded the video to show the comical side (his rather feminine/scared reaction), if anything he shows her getting even (then +1 after that, which I don't think is shown).   I understand it was the way he spoke that bothered you, but the reason I made a remark is because it wasn't done in a way that singles out a gender, from personal experience he (and others) react that way when dying to anyone under those conditions.   I guess you could call this the line between chivalry and equality.   Anyway, it's good that you defend your members, the best bit is you do it for all of them (not just the ladies). :)"

Briggs,3axrt0,fivecott,15,Wed Jun 24 23:03:40 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day the FC is quite irrelevant, bar the first 10 minutes of the match. Other than the initial plan all they need to do is delegate forces appropriately if one lane is getting pounded. The problem is PL's they should be voted for based on experience, lanesmash efforts and general knowledge on the game. Two people come into mind who would be better than 50% of the PL's we bring... /u/n7jpicards and NeroBBQ.   As much as a lot of people have bad taste towards them and their outfit they actually give a shit and know/understand how to get 48 people moving cohesively. This is Briggs issue right now, shit PL's who get flustered and have no experience on how to adapt on the go and do an easy task like forward deploy."
Briggs,3axrt0,TheUltimateChing,5,Wed Jun 24 18:04:39 2015 UTC,"I think PL are by far the most important asset. I think a lot more weight should be placed on PL and PL communicating and working together without the FC, planning and executing stratagem on the fly. FC i really think is a nice bonus but not even a needed asset for a SS. Its great having someone watching a map and pointing out logistical errors that the PL are not seeing. It should not in the least be relied on to win a SS. This is coming from someone who personally thinks he was perhaps the worst PL in SS history. It was how my platoon was explained. How it was meant to operate (Strong squad leaders and initiative to be in multiple hexes). And how it Operated on the day once things went to shit and i was little more than a radio man with constant deploy orders and failing to deviate from the guidelines i thought was expected of my Lead even after i probably should. So yes FC has an impact on how a PL operates but PL makes or breaks the game. 1 Good player attempting to micromanage an entire map is next to impossible. 5 great players working together with 1 person assisting is win. So just saying less emphasis on FC. More on PL and letting them free into the world to do your bidding. Do not repress or micromanage. They know whats going on. What they can spare what needs to be done what the situation is. PL needs to be able to communicate well on TOP of being able to win fights and should be proven Long before being given the job. A good platoon leader gets the job done with less troops. And that seems to be the theme to winning a SS. Good Platoon leads take pressure off FC. Good leaders take pressure off PL."

Briggs,3axrt0,DefenestrateMyStyle,2,Wed Jun 24 23:44:08 2015 UTC,I agree and it's clear that some SS platoon commanders lacked the ability to actually control their platoon.  Picard and Nero are very good at That and wouldn't tolerate people under their command to wander off and fuck around
Briggs,3axrt0,Motster101,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:17:34 2015 UTC,nah FC should clearly go to the player from the best leetfit with the highest KDR
Briggs,3axrt0,BUnit3,13,Thu Jun 25 09:42:13 2015 UTC,"I think it also needs to extent to some platoon leaders, and some squad leaders. We seem to have a lot of people in SS that don't understand basic mechanics like forward deploying, or the best way to do it rather than driving a sundy face first into enemy armour. There is no training done for our leadership, everyone is too busy crying out that individual players need greater IVI and we will win, what a fucking joke.  One thing that would also benefit greatly, but would never happen, would be to stop disclosing stats. Too many people are still focused on making the top of the charts for kills/kdr for SS, rather than focusing on doing what needs to be done to help the team win. I'm tired of watching bases fall while our players are shooting out from the spawn room and not pushing points."
Briggs,3axrt0,fivecott,3,Wed Jun 24 11:21:13 2015 UTC,Interesting thought about the stats. For this match how about we don't fill out the form that puts names to the accounts for the stat tracking? That way the only stats available will be the outfit stats. No individual stats. We can't stop outfit stats as that's a part of the API but we CAN minimize individual epeen swinging  This way we will KNOW. If anyways is shooting from inside a spawn room they can never come back again cause they aint doin it for stats
Briggs,3axrt0,BUnit3,3,Wed Jun 24 22:53:10 2015 UTC,"It was just a suggestion thrown out there, and it may lessen the amount of Statside2 being played."
Briggs,3axrt0,fivecott,2,Thu Jun 25 00:50:39 2015 UTC,"A good one. It has nothing to do with the fact it means we don't have to go thru a spreadsheet making sure everybody is listed as having the correct account even when the number breaks the routine. (I am looking at you ServerSmash0030 - ServerSmash0039 and SeverSmash0431. They are ALL 3 digits except for you! The fact I know that from memory scares me)  Seriously tho it is a massive task that needs to be done on match day and if there is a valid reason not to do it I am all ears : )  We will talk about it prematch. Everyone will know who they are. But pointing at the stats and saying ""THAT WAS ME I SO GUD"" will be alil bit harder. Ultimately server smash isn't about individual performance anyway so I like the idea"
Briggs,3axrt0,voinni2014,2,Thu Jun 25 05:30:13 2015 UTC,"We seem to have a lot of people in SS that don't understand basic mechanics like forward deploying   Pretty much. Carrying out moves requires practice for the infantry players as well. Helping everyone in squads and platoons implement aggressive and mobile tactics, to match the likes of Emerald needs to happen.  The other thing is there should be a second Briggssmash sub with looser security for general performance improvement/tactics that aren't specific to our specific plans for the match day - the current one deals with force organisation and our opening moves..it's on a very need to know basis because of the salty troll that leaked internal discussion. As a result wider ranging stuff is unlikely to get discussed or organized there - (there was a limited discussion on the sub before the loss against Emerald anyway, which is why Briggs is in the current place). The second sub can have somewhat looser security as it doesn't involve specific match plans.  Another point is, we won't get to know who the salty troll was that leaked posts unless there's an amnesty for him and no repercussions for his outfit - i mean , if it wasn't a genuine spy, the crime was just posting a random mildly inflammatory post on stacking by equinub. That way, we'll at least be able to confirm it wasn't a genuine spy and be ok with looser security."
Briggs,3axrt0,BUnit3,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:09:20 2015 UTC,"The troll is someone who is just leaking stuff for shits and giggles. Out of all of the SS's and FC's we have had, how many can say that what they planned was executed for anytime past the first 2 minutes, before shit went pear shaped, and it was then up to making on the spot decisions. If the plans were leaked, all they saw was where we were going to be putting how many numbers into each base at the start."
Briggs,3axrt0,eriman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:00:57 2015 UTC,"Out of all of the SS's and FC's we have had, how many can say that what they planned was executed for anytime past the first 2 minutes   Hello. Some FCs prefer to plan a more dynamic strategy, reacting to and taking advantage of events as they go. I'd suggest it's only effective on a larger scale when they understand enough of the micro tactics to make sure they're being employed, although after a certain point it becomes increasingly difficult/impossible to micro to that extent."
Briggs,3axrt0,BUnit3,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:23:05 2015 UTC,"Microtactics aren't the FCs responsibility. If they're micromanaging then all they're doing is missing the long-term game.  If all they're doing is reacting to events then they're not a good FC. Again, long term game."
Briggs,3axrt0,eriman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:32:20 2015 UTC,"Some FCs prefer to plan a more dynamic strategy, reacting to and taking advantage of events as they go.   That's precisely my point. You can't draw up a plan of how the battle will ensue over the next 2 hours, it's throw troops here to begin with, then get ready."
Briggs,3axrt0,BUnit3,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:04:27 2015 UTC,"While that's true on the outside, a skilled leader is able to take disparate elements of their force and have them coordinate together live in a manner almost indistinguishable from a pre-prepared battle plan.   Have you ever commanded more than one platoon? It compares to commanding a single platoon in the same way commanding a single platoon compares to commanding a squad."
Briggs,3axrt0,BUnit3,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:04:55 2015 UTC,"Have you ever commanded more than one platoon?   I have, not for a very long time. I don't get much enjoyment out of platoon leading, or even squad leading these days. I'm almost thankful that IB doesn't pull those types of numbers anymore lol. Although it is sad to think that in 2012 and early 2013, we had a full IB platoon every night of the week. Sadly most of those guys left the game because of the lack of meta."
Briggs,3axrt0,BUnit3,2,Fri Jun 26 07:12:14 2015 UTC,"I think it also needs to extent to some platoon leaders, and some squad leaders. leaders. We seem to have a lot of people in SS that don't understand basic mechanics like forward deploying, or the best way to do it rather than driving a sundy face first into enemy armour   I agree, and I think that potential FC's should explain how they're going to address such issues.   For example, one might say that they're going to have nightly training sessions to make sure we can get it down pat, whereas another might say that they're going to have squads dedicated to preparing spawn points for capping bases. At least that gives outfit leaders the chance to vote on the FC on something more than their reputation and one paragraph in a spreadsheet."
Briggs,3axrt0,BUnit3,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:32:24 2015 UTC,It's up to the FC that his platoon and squad leaders are up to scratch with these and many other tactics.
Briggs,3axrt0,BUnit3,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:52:18 2015 UTC,"Great, so if Briggs is going to get an FC that's up to scratch with such tactics, what's the best way of selecting them out of the 3-4 people who put their hand up for the role?"
Briggs,3axrt0,Squiizzy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:25:35 2015 UTC,"Probably choose the FC earlier, then have him run with the suggested platoon leaders on live to get a feel for how they control their troops, see how their map awareness is, rather than try to base the  decision off their reputation."
Briggs,3axrt0,BUnit3,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:08:23 2015 UTC,Great - so what's the best way to choose the FC?
Briggs,3axrt0,Squiizzy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:58:56 2015 UTC,"Pull a name out of a hat. Alternatively, have each applicant play with some of the major outfits, let the players get a feel for the commanding abilities. Ultimately, not everyone casting a vote is going to truly understand what capabilities a good FC should have, so it's still going to end up a popularity contest more than anything.  For me personally, I would love to see someone like WarWalker420 thrown into the mix of applicants. The guy knows how to read a map, and knows what counters need to be deployed where and when, and is a good judge of what the enemies next movements will more than likely be. Unfortunately like many other long term vets on Briggs, they are just a bit burnt out, and probably not interested in stepping up to take it on."
Briggs,3axrt0,CassiusDean,4,Fri Jun 26 07:20:08 2015 UTC,"FCs need to play the long game.  The last FC did not play the long game, and the focus on IVI scores reflects that short-sightedness."
Briggs,3axrt0,BUnit3,3,Wed Jun 24 12:22:15 2015 UTC,"The FC saw Briggs losing bases in 50/50 fights. It was not as much as because they had better IVI's, but because they had spawn solutions, and could keep running back onto point, and/or they had so much air dominance that our 50 could barely leave the spawn room. Improving your ability to shoot out from a spawn room isn't going to help much. Learning to redeploy from the next base back and come in behind them might help, but won't do much for your IVI."
Briggs,3axrt0,Vaelkyri,4,Thu Jun 25 00:56:16 2015 UTC,"Have you been around for the SS meetings, mate? Would love to pick your brain about this."
Briggs,3axrt0,Vaelkyri,2,Wed Jun 24 11:36:22 2015 UTC,"I think I went along to one of the very early ones because none of the IB leadership were available, certainly none of the more recent ones."
Briggs,3axrt0,Vaelkyri,2,Wed Jun 24 12:17:08 2015 UTC,You'll be missing these exact conversations then! :)
Briggs,3axrt0,WerefoxNZ,2,Wed Jun 24 14:04:16 2015 UTC,"everyone is too busy crying out that individual players need greater IVI and we will win, what a fucking joke.   We lost equal pop fights because lack of skilled players and shit leadership. Both are an issue."
Briggs,3axrt0,fivecott,3,Thu Jun 25 00:04:19 2015 UTC,"We lost more so because players were sticking around at a base after defending it, allowing the enemy to push back in until they wore the defence down. Instead of having someone spawn a sundy at the next base on the hex line and redeploying, everyone was trying to drive vehicles up the street, hoping that the enemy wouldn't drop back onto the point in the 2-3 minutes that it takes to move your squads forward. This sort of shit can't be put onto the poor FC, this is where we fail on a platoon and squad level, and it's the shit that is losing us matches.  Edit: Plus taking out enemy spawn solutions, utmost priority unless there is 0-60 seconds left on the clock. Decent attackers can easily slowly work a point down with 50/50 pop as long as their dead can keep running back on point. We see this every day on live, and while it makes for an enjoyable fight sometimes if you leave the enemy sundy up, this is not what should be happening in SS. We need guys on the ground who are versatile, not just assuming that Chariot or BAM will be there to take out the sundys. Grab a couple of blokes, pull armour, pull a lib, whatever it needs, don't go thinking it's someone elses job."

We see this every day on live, and while it makes for an enjoyable fight sometimes if you leave the enemy sundy up, this is not what should be happening in SS. We need guys on the ground who are versatile, not just assuming that Chariot or BAM will be there to take out the sundys. Grab a couple of blokes, pull armour, pull a lib, whatever it needs, don't go thinking it's someone elses job.   Ive been tempted to put up a a dedicated demo valk for SS 6 guys on the ground arnt make or break, but they can make any sundy, anywhere, dead + ninja hack and forward drops in downtime. But I just cant be assed dealing with the drama."

It's something I was going to raise as a role for GunR in this SS as it's something we specialise in, moreso than big ass farms and shitfights, however I haven't had a dedicated internet connection and haven't been taking part in any SS discussions.  Seriously though, if you want it done then GunR is the outfit to do it. We have a Valk pilot who has completed the directive, and demo-drops, forward-drops, and lancer-batteries are a thing we do on a regular basis."

Briggs,3axrt0,fivecott,8,Wed Jun 24 11:07:05 2015 UTC,"That seems like a good way to select platoon leaders and squad leaders but the FC role isn't about small forces, single bases, and singles lanes.

Briggs,3axrt0,MadMaukh,5,Wed Jun 24 23:45:20 2015 UTC,"Initially Briggs had regular excursions to other servers, and potential candidates had a chance to show their skills. We don't have that anymore.  Let's not make the mistake of assuming that if you get the FC just right it will automatically win everything. There are a million layers below the FC which have as much of an impact, and we need to start working on those as part of SS.  Other than that having a slightly more rigorous process is slightly better. In the end I suspect that several candidates will have similar plans, and much will will just come down to who people know for the factions they don't play in, and things like if the FC candidate in question hasn't run public platoons for a long time.  A the end of the day the FC is just the force allocator during the match and we shouldn't use the fact that FCs went through a process of writing up plans, which they may have had help with (ICE, R18), to blame our SS performance on FCs or even give the plan FCs came up with as part of their selection process complete weight or neglect improving performance on platoon level/squad level.   Actual command during SS like operations is a better selection option if available. The new conquest mode probably won't be applicable, since counting kills fundamentally breaks it and turns it into a game of cowardice and using baiting+massive overpop to wipe forces out with minimal deaths. Having sunday night ops every 2nd or 3rd sunday with each faction being under a force commander, and submitting recordings of the FC candidates might work."
Briggs,3axrt0,MadMaukh,3,Wed Jun 24 11:32:31 2015 UTC,"Having sunday night ops every 2nd or 3rd sunday with each faction being under a force commander   Forget SS, we need to do that on a regular basis simply for the health of the server."

Later on it's determined you have no idea what to do and all of what you said was just hot air.  Important roles like this should be chosen based on actual experience leading at the same scale. A 5 minute Powerpoint presentation and explanation of ""my grand plan"" isn't going to prove anything.   Currently, the force commander role is picked not only on popularity and familiarity, but also each voter's thoughts on whether the proposed FC's have the experience and capability to lead the SS. If a voter doesn't bother to get to know the proposed FCs and instead just picks their buddy, then they have nobody else to blame. A 5 min presentation isn't going to change their vote at all either."

Briggs,3axrt0,PowerDown1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:12:36 2015 UTC,"Are you familiar with executive level job interviews? Often they do things called behavioural interviews where candidates are asked questions about their previous experiences and what the outcomes were, and how they would handle hypothetical situations. Why not do something similar to that for choosing the FC?    Important roles like this should be chosen based on actual experience leading at the same scale.    I agree. Does the current system cut it? Does everyone know every candidate and their skillset?    If a voter doesn't bother to get to know the proposed FCs and instead just picks their buddy, then they have nobody else to blame.   Are you comfortable with that? The idea that people voting for the FC might have so little idea of what the candidates have to offer that they will just vote in their buddy? Is that the best system we can come up with?   A 5 min presentation isn't going to change their vote at all either.   Why not? If there are three candidates, one of which is well known, one of which is kind of known, and one of which is unknown, which one is going to get the vote? The one who is going to do the best job?"
Briggs,3axrt0,-unbless-,4,Thu Jun 25 16:10:26 2015 UTC,"Focus on selecting the best squad leaders before fc this includes training on commanding breeches, simple flanking, Beacon abuse (even with new implementation) smart weapon abuse, flexibility, adaptation being Gud for entry fragging, all squads should be capable of all game play with exclusive exceptions for bam. but that's just my opinion.  If I was fc there would be three types of squads. Sustainer, floater, and breecher. Breecher to take the point and clear defences. Sustainer to hold an offensive base or point/position in a base occasionally used in defence to buy time in conjunction with breeching. And floater is cancer gal and extra bodies when the time comes and can ""float""  between contested bases. Just my opinion"
Briggs,3axrt0,-unbless-,3,Wed Jun 24 13:14:20 2015 UTC,"I agree that we need to improve on squad leadership, platoon leadership, and tactics in general, but that doesn't mean that we can't (and shouldn't) improve on FC selection as well."
Briggs,3axrt0,UltraKillex,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:26:42 2015 UTC,Yeah my post is vague I definitely still believe that the fc and the greater team strategy is important but getting shit done on the ground wins the base and needs just as much attention if not more. Can't be wob with good map modelling and adaptation by fc alone.
Briggs,3axrt0,-unbless-,4,Wed Jun 24 13:30:31 2015 UTC,It was my understanding some of this already happens. The potential FC's go around and talk to outfit reps about what they would be doing  For the first couple of matches you were right. Nobody knew anybody and it was blind luck Loki turned out to be a good FC. But now? We all know each other and how each person thinks enough to make the call based purely on name. The more we politicize this the worse FC we will get at the end of the day. If they have to campaign for votes we have already lost. As it is 3 or 4 people stand up and the one the outfit leads think has the best shot of winning wins. Then we all listen to that one. Leaves no room for resentment or feelings. Even if the best man doesn't get the job everyone follows the FC on the day  On the subject of tinfoil I would be remiss if I didn't say hello to Fara. Yes we did get to 240. I keep telling Briggs your not Irish your Scottish but I think that is only encouraging them . . .
Briggs,3axrt0,XCVJoRDANXCV,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:02:30 2015 UTC,"It was my understanding some of this already happens. The potential FC's go around and talk to outfit reps about what they would be doing   Some of it, with some of the candidates. Is there room for improvement in the process though? Wouldn't it be easier and more effective for everyone to have a 15-20 minute meeting so that each candidate can discuss what they want to bring to the role? If it's happening anyway then what's the problem with centralising and standardising the process so that we can level the playing field and make sure that it gets done properly?   We all know each other and how each person thinks enough to make the call based purely on name   Really? If every outfit leader knows each candidate to that degree then what I'm proposing is a moot point, but honestly I find it hard to believe that's true. Actually knowing how a person commands, especially if they're from a different faction or you haven't worked with them in combined operations or public platoons, isn't as simple as knowing their name or what their outfit can do.   If they have to campaign for votes we have already lost.   Isn't your understanding that some of this already happens? That potential FC's go around and talk to outfit reps about what they would be doing? Isn't that a pretty good definition of campaigning?    Even if the best man doesn't get the job everyone follows the FC on the day   So how would that be different if the people voting for the candidates had a bit more information about the candidates and what they're proposing for SS before placing their vote?"
Briggs,3axrt0,Cloudy87VS,2,Thu Jun 25 16:16:47 2015 UTC,So we went from 5 min to 15 - 20 min for each. Ok. 3 candidates on a slow match. that is an hour. I don't know if you noticed but our smash meetings go long enough as it is without adding more to them. You ask what the difference would be. If every candidate had a chance to get on his soapbox at the meetings they would literally last 3 or 4 hours. Know who would show up the the next meeting?   Nobody except the FC candidates  We know cause we tried it one time  What already happens is people chat in the communal and in each other's TS with all the people who have opinions and everyone contributes thoughts to the plan. I wouldn't call it campaigning. Stratagizing (AKA communal shittalk) would be a more accurate term. From such talks combined with the platoon leading of everyone who has stepped up to FC I have a fair idea what kind of FC each of them will be.
Briggs,3axrt0,XCVJoRDANXCV,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:58:52 2015 UTC,"No, five minutes each for the three or four candidates, being a total of fifteen to twenty minutes"

Making more demands of our mid level and squad level commanders is more in the right step. Outfits need to bring their a game, do you have nights you play like [insert outfit you admire] Bring that, and cap bases."
Briggs,3axrt0,AsianMuffinBriggs,5,Wed Jun 24 12:59:33 2015 UTC,"Asking people who want to be the FC to present their SS plan in a five minute speech (or QnA session) is asking too much? Will that be the straw that breaks their back, even though it would be the first step in the process?"

Briggs,3ayka9,crushdepth5thFaction,0,Thu Jun 25 00:23:38 2015 UTC,i played it on PS4 it runs ok despite its low frame rate.   looks very nice and seems to play well but i suck more so with a a controller compared to mouse and keyboard.  Also having things locked by BR is quite annoying at least early on  for example as BR1 you only get to spawn flashes and use LA/HA only. Sure it doesnt bother me much but for those new people jumping in and having only two classes to play and only a flash to get anywhere makes it less likely for people to keep playing at least when you compare it to PC where people can spawn anything and play anything from BR1.

They have changed so many things in number 2 that it's such a different game to what it was in 2012. They needed to have set goals, set ideas about resources, hex system mechanics, not constantly keep changing  as it's been anything but beneficial to the game. Most people preferred the way it was done in PS1 and very early PS2."

I expect PS2 will be around for at least another three years before they even start thinking of PS3. Whether or not Briggs lasts that long is another story, but either way I hope that in that timeframe (sooner, rather than later) they will fulfil the potential that PS2 has in terms of profitability if only so that they have a larger advertising budget to get more people interested in the game."

Briggs,3awrl9,ShapesNeroBBQ,22,Wed Jun 24 03:08:56 2015 UTC,Most of the players that participate in lanesmash and SS etc. wouldn't be playing the game at all if it wasn't for the community events. Playing on live can be repetitive these community events give us the ability to have fights of equal pop and no stupid 50% off max bonuses.  I also feel trying to move an entire outfit and consistently telling the developers to shutdown Briggs and merge the account to Connery did far worse damage to pop then any community event could of.
Briggs,3awrl9,KnifeyGavin,-7,Wed Jun 24 03:29:18 2015 UTC,"Is that not more wishful thinking, that perhaps the game was more like a traditional server based FPS with fixed teams?   I would argue there are far better titles for that mentality than Planetside 2.   Part of the magic of Ps2 is un structured encounters,   Why are people wanting the same bland experience offered by every FPS game apart from Planetside2? In planetside 2? Does that not strike you as unusual?"
Briggs,3awrl9,RichiesGhost,3,Wed Jun 24 03:37:46 2015 UTC,"Part of the magic of Ps2 is un structured encounters,    SS and LS aren't structured beyond the numbers being equal and planning time for opening moves - after about ten minutes that goes out the window as the numbers are spread out all over the place whilst planning turns into a shit-fight.    Why are people wanting the same bland experience offered by every FPS game apart from Planetside2?   Because SS and LS are a chance to play PS2 the way that it should be played, with combined squads, platoon, armour, and air, working together as a cohesive, competitive force to simulate war in a way that makes Chess seem like a game for children and toothless invalids - regular server play rarely has any of that, and even when the circumstances are right for it often devolves into a team death match event / farm that you could play on any old game of COD any old day of the week."
Briggs,3awrl9,-unbless-,-2,Wed Jun 24 03:53:45 2015 UTC,"so when you say ""combined armor and air working cohesively rarely happens on live"" is that based on your own experiences?  from my experience i cannot fathom why anyone would ever leave the warpgate without at least two of the three working in unison.  what im trying to say is...  if you are chasing the ""simulated war"" by participating in the occasional live event you are chasing the dragon... if you want a simulated war... command in a way that brings this about for live play.  once you burn out on that idea, command in a way that brings about your preferred experience.  This game makes that easier to accomplish than any other."
Briggs,3awrl9,RichiesGhost,3,Wed Jun 24 04:30:36 2015 UTC,"if you are chasing the ""simulated war"" by participating in the occasional live event you are chasing the dragon... if you want a simulated war... command in a way that brings this about for live play.   So how often are you commanding a force of 240+ people on Planetside? How often are you even taking part in that kind of force?   I'm not talking about leading a platoon or being part of a platoon, whether it's off doing its own little thing and contributing nothing, or else helping win the alert but effectively operating in isolation. I'm talking about the kind of conditions that SS brings, where if we were doing it on live we would have entire factions playing in unison rather than squads playing in isolation.  Yes, we can circle jerk about how to 'build a better Briggs' but at the end of the day, Briggs is what it is and SS is a league above that."
Briggs,3awrl9,Spajina,12,Wed Jun 24 04:45:03 2015 UTC,"You would think that but here we are after two years, three factions, two servers and countless Reddit accounts and you still feel the need to drop maxes and overpop on any and every fight."

Briggs,3awrl9,Gabba202,8,Wed Jun 24 03:54:37 2015 UTC,"No, because the various smashes and leagues:   Add a new spin to the game, helping to keep interest up and reduce the 'rinse and repeat' nature of the game; Help improve us as players and as squads, which helps improve the day to day aspects of the game;  Represent 'sunk costs' in terms of time and effort, meaning that we become more invested in the game and in honouring our sunk costs;   In contrast, participation in the various smashes and leagues has a negligible effect on prime time due to the following:    In terms of SS, there are only two hours every couple of months when 240-288 are off server; SS is usually held at a time outside of our primetime; Massive SS 'invasions' of Connery/Miller/Emerald/etc/ aren't really a thing (though they should be) - if they are done, it's only a few squads to a platoon doing it; Lane Smash is a small event held once a week or so for an ninety minutes and its takes about 24 players from each faction (or about 15% of the total world pop during primetime);    I call for a suspension of any 'Off Briggs' activities and instead urge Briggs players to focus on events that happen on Briggs   What events that happen on Briggs? If there were structured alternatives then sure, we should focus on them, but there aren't any of the following organised events so what choice does that leave us:   Faction Smashes where each faction has an FC and the majority of each faction is in platoons; Lane Smashes (that aren't farms); Armour/Air smashes;   Briggs isn't going to grow, or even stop its slow but steady decline, if we suspend fun aspects of the game even if they aren't on Briggs. Instead of suggesting suspension of fun aspects of the game, how about suggesting (and organising) events that are within the server and encourage people to play? How about advertising the events we do have so that new players are attracted to the server?"
Briggs,3awrl9,paziggie,5,Wed Jun 24 03:26:10 2015 UTC,"Pulling players to Jaegar every once in a week has no relative impact on player retention compared to the other problems in this game (poor performance, slow content release, no territory meta).  If anything, community-based events are to be encouraged to enhance player retention since these events like lanesmash and SS actually provide the territory meta experience and let you play the game as DBG intended us to."
Briggs,3awrl9,BestAssassinAU2,17,Wed Jun 24 05:20:35 2015 UTC,"There are 8760 hours in a year. Say we do 6 smashes a year that's 12 hours + 12 for the pre and post match. Let's be generous and say that lanesmash will take about 30 hours away from the total aswell. That's 54 hours. 54/8760  = 0.6% total time per year that Briggs will definitely potentially have ~250-300 less people on the server. Now with my masters in statistical analysis and kebabs, i can safely say that these events have no fucking effect on the health of briggs and that you're just a dickhead for thinking so."
Briggs,3awrl9,pkisbest,4,Wed Jun 24 03:22:53 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind Gabba that a lot of old Briggs vets come back solely to play in the SS, and if it weren't for that they wouldn't be playing PS2 at all. I think that estimate of ~250-300 less people is much higher than reality."

But for now, I'm playing Dirty Bomb and whatever the fuck else catches my eye."
Briggs,3awrl9,AzureProdigy,7,Wed Jun 24 03:42:43 2015 UTC,"Serious response.   No, what you are describing are the symptoms of a larger issue that has been progressing for some time now. For the sake of argument, that is the degradation of objective and strategic play and the increasing tactical ineptitude of any new players starting to play on the server all while the vets get burnt out on the many flaws of the game.   Live game play these days seems to be a zergy mess. Nobody or at least very few people actually want to play the game any more as if territory matters. It really does seem to be a massive zerg on each border while 3 or 4 other latices have 0% pop. That is pretty fucking sad to be honest. Recent updates have seen a drastic improvement on redeploy side, maxes, map tactics and weapon balance. The community has been begging for meta for years, its here and as a server we have become more deathmatchside than ever before. At the end of the day, this is a game, any incentive or depth to objective play is added at the will of the devs, but meaning is determined by the players. Territory matters if it's decided it matters. That is why we play Server Smash, and Lane smash, farmers and any other higher format of the game.   These formats are what invigorates the game, gets outfits and players on live practising and playing the objective.  Loosing that will kill the game far quicker than what the community is already doing."
Briggs,3awrl9,TheFullCologne,2,Wed Jun 24 05:19:27 2015 UTC,"What happened is that DBG/SOE didn't bother giving players a real incentive to play for territory and then dasanfall's in depth stat tracking website became open to people without codes. From that point, stats began to fill the void where people wanted something more than chasing certs/territory that is easily reset. Stats have a long term value, even with as questionable as stats are, objective play and territory on live doesn't. The result is that a lot of people still playing want to play team deathmatch instead of whatever it is DBG thinks the goal of the game is. It is a case of too little too late imo."
Briggs,3awrl9,jmz01,3,Wed Jun 24 07:36:19 2015 UTC,"Many enjoy playing the game, but there are outfits that look forward to these events, including the same players who come to reddit presumably disappointed with the game or more exited about drama, besides what else are we going to post? Buff MAXes?"
Briggs,3awrl9,fivecott,3,Wed Jun 24 03:19:45 2015 UTC,"A lot of these events keep people playing and interested in the game.  Use Farmer's League as an example, a lot of the guys stayed playing on live in preparation for that.  Now that it's looking like there wont be another one, a lot of those guys are playing other games.  Really of all these competitions, only SS has a genuine impact on server population.  In real terms that's about 3 hours actually off Briggs every 6-8 weeks and half of those are morning matches.  The benefit of it keeping people interested in the game and seeking to be competitive is well worth the comparatively small cost of a few hours of an empty server."
Briggs,3awrl9,jmz01,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:32:37 2015 UTC,A second season of farmers would be cool but its one of the more organisation intensive formats that needs teams to be much more structured and people to be on the ball more with getting teams ready.
Briggs,3awrl9,PeRXeRs,3,Wed Jun 24 03:36:32 2015 UTC,"It's events like lanesmash and serversmash that keep some vets playing, i know it's partly the reason why I play.  Live play is just a reason to chill with my outfit mates to get better individually and as a group, you can play territory for so long before it becomes meh"
Briggs,3awrl9,jmz01,3,Wed Jun 24 03:49:28 2015 UTC,"I can definitely see your point, and you can have an upvote for discussion purposes. As someone else has pointed out though, these community events are what keep some people going, and if sacrificing 1 day of normal server activity for the other 6 days of fairly stable server activity is what it takes, that's fine. That's also not to mention the prep that some would do on live as well, outfits might be running ops in prep, bringing some challenge to some alerts (not that there wasn't any before, you just have more). Overall, I think organised community events can only be good for  a server's population, for some people, it's what they need to keep playing."
Briggs,3awrl9,WerefoxNZ,3,Wed Jun 24 04:01:29 2015 UTC,"Thankyou for the well written reply and actually that argument makes sense to me.   If that is the case, I would not wish to remove what keeps people here, but if I could ask those same players to somehow compensate Briggs by logging on a little bit more during those weeks with events slotted in, would make a huge difference to Briggs overall activity in those weeks.   Great post ty."
Briggs,3awrl9,fivecott,4,Wed Jun 24 04:08:48 2015 UTC,"Hey Nero serious talk here. Organize something. We already have the Briggs Sunday night ops of most outfits. We don't touch Sunday night for that very reason. But if you want more live play be proactive and organize it.   Even something as small as a post on Reddit along the lines of ""R18 is going to go kill things on the TR front for the next few hours. SOCA, JUGA, RIP, Log in and come kill us!"". I think you would be amazed at how many people log in to kill you : )  Be proactive about On Briggs rather than negative about about Off Briggs. Just my 2c"

Added to that, the increased challenge as well. Using ZETA as an example from last night's Hossin alert, when I logged on, TR was getting their ass kicked, but then we had somewhat of a comeback over the next hour or so. Then ZETA (in a really good move), captured 1 facility (I think it was Mossridge, from memory), and with that, cut off most of the territory we'd captured in the past hour. It was very depressing watching that territory be capped by VS and NC over the next 15 or so minutes, but that's part of the challenge though. I don't know if ZETA was doing ops in prep for SS or not, but regardless, it's the sort of thing that needs to be practiced for SS (and seriously, good job ZETA on that cut off, it was very well done)."
Briggs,3awrl9,DefenestrateMyStyle,2,Wed Jun 24 04:40:39 2015 UTC,"Ouh yeah, I can remember that cap :)   We had no Ops, was normal squad play, but we allways play the map meta and cutting off Mossridge was exactly what we needed :)"
Briggs,3awrl9,DefenestrateMyStyle,2,Wed Jun 24 09:49:34 2015 UTC,"Yep, about half our territory fell in short order after that. I tried a 1-man last minute defence of acan, which unfortunately didn't work out well for me, given the 10 or so people there, was very depressing lol. As I said though, good job :)"
Briggs,3awrl9,NSGDX1,2,Wed Jun 24 12:49:58 2015 UTC,"You raise some valid concerns, but not anything the individual organisers haven't already considered. Getting more population is always going to be a balance between population on server, and organised events. I'd be hesitant to outright can anything that gets us more exposure to a wider source of players, or potential players, at this point. Especially given the advertising budget for Planetside 2 seems to be somewhere from non-existent to fuck all.  The actual ServerSmashes are very rarely during Briggs prime times, so I don't think they will have that much of an impact overall. The lane smashes we do are during primetime, so perhaps we could look to move them to some other time. I don't organise it so its not my call to make.  But then I'm also not a great judge of how it impacts the server. Since taking the SS rep role, my actual PS2 play time has quartered, although I do still spend the same number of hours a week on PS2 stuff."
Briggs,3awrl9,PeRXeRs,2,Wed Jun 24 03:33:12 2015 UTC,Soon Werefox you wont log in at all. You will play planetside via spreadsheets. When you ARE in game people will send you tells amazed that your actually online and then someone will poke you because you forgot to log out of the communal and you'll get disconnected for inactivity in 5 min . . .
Briggs,3awrl9,bigpbigp,2,Wed Jun 24 07:51:02 2015 UTC,"Prime time on saturday sucks major ass when there's no organized play ):  I love the idea of lane smash, but not if it will hurt the already dwindling server pop."
Briggs,3awrl9,paziggie,4,Wed Jun 24 08:08:29 2015 UTC,"Even if an outfit participates in SS,  Lane Smash and PSBL that would still probably add up to 10hrs or less a month.   Competitive play is the end game for most clans/outfits/whatever no matter the game and PS2 is no different."
Briggs,3awrl9,-unbless-,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:30:26 2015 UTC,"Statistics do not reflect the true impact of removing an under populated servers organised player base all at the same time.   It ruins the servers activity for the entire day those events happen, and sadly that is normally the weekend, traditionally busy days for briggs."
Briggs,3awrl9,AzureProdigy,2,Wed Jun 24 03:34:32 2015 UTC,You should take into account that about half the SS we participate in are held out of our prime time as well

Briggs,3awrl9,crushdepth5thFaction,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:46:47 2015 UTC,"Participate in Lane Smash in future and you might change your opinion.  I did so last week the first time and I think it is a great way to exchange Leadership experience with other or new Squad and Platoon leaders. We had a good briefing after the event, where we talked about misstakes, wrong calls on the map, communitcation issues and so on.   The other events like Battle League take only 1-1,5 hours for each outfit (all 2-4 weeks), but can be a great activity booster since people like this tournament-competition thingy.  Thx for your thoughts though. Looking forward to see R18 back in those events in the near future."
Briggs,3awrl9,-unbless-,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:00:10 2015 UTC,"After taking an unplanned break away from planetside recently, I will say that these organised 'off-server' events are probably the only reason Briggs has any pop (for all of the reasons already mentioned and more). I took a break not because I planned to, or had any thoughts on it, I just stopped logging on one day because I was not having fun, and I didn't feel the need to log on for another few months.   The reason I was not having fun is because the devs have tried really hard to dumb down the game and make it easier for new players. In the process dumbing down (increased accessibility) has ruined all of the things that made the game any better than other FPS's. What no one realises in the planetside factory (DBG) is that if all you want to do is play a game that is easy to access, there are lots and lots of really good FPS games with way bigger budgets and better support. What makes (could/should make) planetside different (better) is the strategy and game meta provided by combined arms on big maps, and the potential for greater community depth and organisation over other lobby shooter FPS games.   By dumbing it down because it is viewed as being too confusing for new players, or too had for new players to learn most of planetsides competitive advantage has been removed. This is made worse by pandering to the ideas like, everyone should be equal; everyone should be able to play a MAX suit whenever they want; this sucks because  I spent all my nanites on an ESF and got shot down in 3 secs, I should be able to get straight back in another one and if I cant I will stop playing the game forever. The need to make concessions for these ideas is helping to kill the last bits of game meta. There are also plenty of other ways DBG have pandered to easy access for new players (mostly new players that are unfit to play planetside and now give up in 1 week instead of the 1 hour it would have been without the concessions). This has killed the market niche in the process.   Anyway my point is that planetside had a place in the gaming world where it would have been successful. By trying to make it easy for everyone to pick it up and play, this place has been taken away. We are left with a game in a market that it can not compete. Get real, get the game meta and strategy back, and you will find that very slowly the game will grow as an alternative to the aim and shoot crap. Pander to easy access and you have just made more aim and shoot crap.  'off-server' events let people who dream for more meta and strategy, pretend for a few hours every once in a while that it really exists, before we are brought back to reality with a thud with easy access on planetside live."
Briggs,3awrl9,Spajina,0,Thu Jun 25 14:51:43 2015 UTC,Hahaha... you serious?
Briggs,3awrl9,RichiesGhost,0,Wed Jun 24 03:12:30 2015 UTC,Why else would I post it.
Briggs,3awrl9,RichiesGhost,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:35:11 2015 UTC,"IMO ""training"" is what outfits ought to do on live during (prime time) alerts.  Then we take any ""winning formulas"" into a smash, having already weighed it's efficacy in ACTUAL combat."
Briggs,3awrl9,RichiesGhost,2,Wed Jun 24 03:19:43 2015 UTC,Thing is its a completely different game playing against pubs vs organised outfits. The entire concept of lane smash is that its a small scale SS on one of the lanes used in matches. Controlled environment with equal pops on each side means a fairly accurate representation of the conditions of SS and thus a solid testing be for tactics.
Briggs,3awrl9,fivecott,3,Wed Jun 24 03:25:44 2015 UTC,"You don't win SS with equal pop at bases. This was proven time and time again with the command of sen7rygun and captianthirsty who seemed overly reliant on reinforcing bases to 50:50... Lanesmash is not a substitute for live play and not an appropriate environment to practice for SS. Anyone that thinks otherwise is most likely delusional. The only upside lanesmash has going for it is that it is a community event and that's about it.  TBH i'd hate to say it but i foresee briggs losing yet another SS, I don't think any real critical analysis has been done on prior performance and the SS team will most likely repeat the same mistakes that caused them to lose. I would like to be proven wrong."
Briggs,3awrl9,RichiesGhost,11,Wed Jun 24 03:41:23 2015 UTC,Server smash is entirely won on winning your 50/50 engagements. When we have won Smashes it has been as a direct result of us winning the hard fights not the easy ones.
Briggs,3awrl9,-unbless-,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:53:56 2015 UTC,"You mean dumping 50 maxes, right?"
Briggs,3awrl9,RichiesGhost,0,Wed Jun 24 07:09:12 2015 UTC,"lets take a scenario approach then.  you want to defend a base cap, the enemy has made it to point already, you already have 50/50 pop... what do you do?  I know a squad of  spaj would make a difference and could fight back on point, but lets be fair... you are not the average participant... some peoples skills are higher than others and we have not changed our stance on being inclusive with our participation.  what do you do... when you KNOW you cant 50/50???  lose the hex?  or bring more and quickly redeploy them / gal drop them back after the job is done?"
Briggs,3awrl9,-unbless-,6,Wed Jun 24 04:06:56 2015 UTC,"If you are constantly responding to enemy movements then you've already lost. This isn't live. You dropping 12 more than your enemy on a point leaves you 12 short elsewhere. At the end of the day one of the single most important things in a Smash is individual skill. You don't need to be Exocett, you just need to be better than the guy you are trading bullets with at that moment.  Too many of the ""commanders"" in the server are overly reliant on numbers to win, and that's fine, but my argument has always been (and will always be) that if you aren't forced to actually beat your opponent then you're never going to improve.  Zerging will win you fights and it has it's place but a smart player with equal forces is going to towel you ebery day of the week.  You don't see people saying ""X zergfit quit the game so we lost the Smash"" but I see a lot of ""too many vets burnt out"" posts every time after a loss."
Briggs,3awrl9,RichiesGhost,3,Wed Jun 24 04:32:06 2015 UTC,If you are constantly responding to enemy movements then you've already lost.   Which is exactly what happened in the last two smashes.
Briggs,3awrl9,fivecott,3,Wed Jun 24 04:56:35 2015 UTC,"you want to defend a base cap, the enemy has made it to point already, you already have 50/50 pop... what do you do?   If we're assuming that we have three minutes to go and say, 24v24?  Let them sit on point with their thumbs up their asses. Flank the base in whatever means available, be that harassers from next door, valks from above, or teleporters from within. Destroy their spawn options. 120 seconds remain.  Move onto point with breach and clear tactics - hit them from two to three entry points after throwing in concussion, flash, and EMP grenades. 60 seconds remain.  Trade off a few losses and attack the point again if necessary, only the second time around it's much easier because they're no longer as well established on point and they can't reinforce their position as the can't spawn in the hex.   or bring more and quickly redeploy them / gal drop them back after the job is done?   If it's a 50:50 fight then reinforcements can't redeploy into the base. Even if you manage to get the squad leader in and they put down a beacon, the redeployside nerfs mean that that tactics now means jack shit. So, three minutes remain:  Get the orders to the squad/s, the Gal/s loaded, and the Gal/s from point A to point B. 90 seconds remain.  Combine efforts with the in-house defenders and clear the point. Point is secure but you still need to wipe out the spawns. 30 seconds remain.   Around the 4 minute mark, the pop-sink is over however meanwhile, at the next base over (where you just removed one to two squads from...)   what do you do... when you KNOW you cant 50/50???   The biggest contributing factor to us losing the last two smashes is because Briggs, with few exceptions, relies on overpop to win a fight rather than teamwork and tactics."
Briggs,3awrl9,1WAVE1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:24:18 2015 UTC,"On point, in the base, maybe a few near their sunderers. It doesn't really matter because the point is that bringing in more numbers isn't the most efficient way to do things, and in SS it's the least efficient way of doing things when you factor in travel times and the simple fact that it's two side with equal numbers having a go at one another.  It's not a normal alert. You don't have the luxury of one faction fighting another so that you can take advantage of the weaker faction through zerging. If you overpop one base, you underpop another base, which is fine if you're willing to trade bases but if your overall strategy relies on zerging than you're effectively fucked because you will always be on the defensive."
