DnDGreentext,3e396o,DoUThinkIGiveAHeck,25,Tue Jul 21 16:54:39 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of our last DnD game.  One of our party got teleported to a mountain top by a really complicated trap, with all the treasure.  Tossed all the gold off the mountain side.  Trekked down.  Made a sleigh to haul all the gold, while I and the third party member used the capital we had to buy a cart, and divination spells, and track him down.  We were never supposed to have that much gold and loot, which is part of why the DM made the trap so hard.  He thought we'd ditch the treasure, and count it as a lost.  We all laughed, but he was a first time DM, and most of his prior RP experience was as a part of our World of Darkness and L5R games where our group was a lot less mercenary.  Edit: For some perspective, the teleported PC thought we were both dead, and we thought he might be dead, but knew where the loot had went and where it was moving.  The DM kept throwing obstacles the whole time while we tracked him down, and he was getting fucked up all the time by the wilds, the cold, starvation, etc.  We were just so stubborn, he finally gave up."

""Well, in the World of Darkness game, we were high schoolers, terrified for our lives.  In the L5R campaign, we were Samurai, and holding to strict codes of honor, and working for our lord/family/clan, not for koku.  ....In this game, we made greedy sons of bitches, who risk their lives for gold.  So... Yeah."""

DnDGreentext,3e0t0w,Ninjbob101,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:53:51 2015 UTC,Well Its really fun DM'ing for only one person.  As far as player vs. character knowledge there isn't much overlap as far as I recall.   Also yes even as a level 9 character she has frequently been injured and near death.  Luckily she has goblin followers elsewhere in the land and most goblins have heard of her and don't attack since they know she is good to goblins (she once fed a starving band of goblins and has since become something of a goblin folk hero).   Other times an NPC accompanied her through certain parts and was able to fend off some attacks.

In a Classic Deadlands game I was playing a mean-as-a-rattler, vengeful and generally unpleasant gunslinger and a friend was playing an alchemist.  We both had developed minor phobias of the undead (slight penalty on attack rolls, mechanically).  We then got attacked by a pair of zombies.  Panicking, he through a flask of Greek fire, hitting both myself and a zombie setting us on fire.  I got 4 shots in a turn thanks to my pair of high quality double action peacemakers (my high skill made my go-to strategy, shoot it repeatedly in the head with a called shot, generally).  I tried a called shot to the head of the guy who set me on fire, then I sent a headshot at the wounded zombie, then 2 at the last, unhurt zombie.  The ONLY one I missed was the PC and both zombies dropped.   ...The next turn, I acted to put myself out.  I didn't fudge or just do a warning shot, my character fully intended to put a bullet in the guy's head and the shot was actually more likely to hit him because I didn't take penalties for the phobia.

With this connection he was able to keep a sort of Big Brother watch over the entire city."

DnDGreentext,3dh7vl,Nerdn1,5,Thu Jul 16 14:16:28 2015 UTC,"When I was playing a Pathfinder Dwarf Druid, I had some fun with burning disarm.  Someone had turned my dinosaur animal companion, Agna, into a chibi-verson of her former glory (pup-shape, shrinks and weakens animals) and I was facing a guy (rogue or part rogue iirc) armed with a great flail which, the GM implied, he was very proud of.    I shot him with burning disarm which is an interesting spell d4/level fire damage (5d4 cap) with a reflex save to negate the damage IF AND ONLY IF you decide to drop your weapon.  My foe easily succeeded the save and decided to avoid the damage, figuring he'd just pick up the weapon his next turn, which was quite soon.  He forgot about one thing...  Me: ""Agna, grab the flail and runaway!""  GM/Flail-guy: ""What!?""  Agna, who had a point in linguistics from when I upped her int to 3, grabs the weapon and flees, from the disarmed foe.  He spent a couple rounds trying to chase the tiny dinosaur before remembering he had a sap, but he was still significantly less dangerous after losing his primary weapon.  After Agna's chibification wore off and a couple of their guys were down and a little on-fire, they accepted our offer of surrender.  We patched them up and had a nice chat about the lies their employer told them to get this non-evil party to go try to take us out.  The next scene involves an invisible raptor ambush, but that is another story."

DnDGreentext,3dc8gj,abcd_z,54,Wed Jul 15 03:29:29 2015 UTC,I remember a forum post somewhere talking about how a cat can beat a lvl 1 commoner 75% of the time. So this seems about right.
DnDGreentext,3dc8gj,Socific,37,Wed Jul 15 04:43:58 2015 UTC,"Relevant stats on a housecat: 3 attacks in a full attack, with one at -1 to hit and two at +4 to hit, on average 2 hp, 14 ac. A single attack is at +4 to hit.  Relevant stats for an average level 1 commoner: 1 attack in a full attack at -1 to +0 to hit, on average 1 to 2 hp, and, if they're lucky, 10 ac.  Yeah, it's pretty much in the cat's favor, because even if the commoner manages to grapple it (the cat has a whopping -12 to grapple), the cat can still use all of its natural weapons in the next round and kill the commoner before the commoner can try to do damage to it through the grapple, or pin it to prevent it attacking and then damage it in the grapple. An exceptionally gifted commoner might actually have some +1 modifiers, this still doesn't swing things in his favor in any noticeable way.  ...I need a better hobby."
DnDGreentext,3dc8gj,lifelongfreshman,14,Wed Jul 15 05:35:19 2015 UTC,"Also (IIRC), the cat will get an AoO when the commoner tries to make a melee touch attack to grapple (which is not guaranteed to hit), and if the cat hits the AoO (a decent chance) the grapple attempt fails.  If the commoner actually gets into the grapple, he's probably won, but short of that he's fucked."
DnDGreentext,3dc8gj,Paradigmist,4,Wed Jul 15 06:53:48 2015 UTC,"You do recall correctly, and what's more, the cat is guaranteed to do at minimum 1 damage as long as it hits despite its massive penalty to strength. That could easily kill the commoner in one hit."
DnDGreentext,3dc8gj,lifelongfreshman,6,Wed Jul 15 19:42:20 2015 UTC,"Let's do some math.  For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that if the commoner hits 0 hit points, he's as good as dead (since any significant action will drop him to negatives).  Let's also assume that his stats are determined by 3d6 in order, and his hit dice are determined by rolling (as opposed to averaging).  Given that, his possible hit point values (and their respective probabilities) are:    HP Probability (%)    1 30.2025%   2 19.7875%   3 19.7875%   4 15.5075%   5 9.3725%   6 4.0500%   7 1.1775%   8 0.1150%    So yeah, 30% chance he gets killed right off the bat."

Unfortunately, finding and/or discovering who was the necromancer seems to have been an unreasonable jump.  I don't suppose there was one NPC that seemed a lot less stressed by the zombies?  Generally, a DM should set up a scenario to allow more than one definitive way out of the situation and multiple clues to solutions.  Alternatively, if the PCs seem to be completely ignoring what seems like an obvious solution, you can allow one of their odd-ball suggestions a leg-up or drop an extra hint or something (maybe an NPC made the perception check you missed)."

DnDGreentext,3dbq9r,Sir_NoScope,2,Wed Jul 15 01:03:17 2015 UTC,"[Original Writing as Follows]  Growing up in a big city is hard for a kid who lost his parents. Or a kid who got separated from his parents. Or a kid who never had parents. He doesn't really remember. He remembers spending his early days on the street, stealing food and begging to survive. While he wasn't the best at stealing the food, he was quite the escape artist once he had ahold of it. While his people skills were not the greatest (probably due to lack of effort), his greatest asset being his acrobatic finesse, coupled with quick thinking and rapid reflexes.  Many years later, he decided it was time to leave. Escaping over the city's wall at night with a meager supply of rations, he traveled. Most would expect him to travel north, south, east, or west, but in truth, he had no idea where he was heading. Eventually, he ended up in a nearby kingdom, Almas as he later came to understand.  Once in the city, he immediately signed up to become a soldier, figuring it would be a fast way to earn an income and secure his own survival. Once there, he immediately befriended an Orc by the name of Rchimedes, together deciding to drop their original names, in favor of Ross and Cromarty.  Ross and Cromarty spent about two years as Soldiers, during which Cromarty taught Ross what he knew about linguistics, love, life, and friendship, while Ross told his friend about the days of his youth. Cromarty had grown up in a middle class family, his father working as a woodcutter and his mother as a seamstress, doing their best to afford schooling and training for their son. Both of which absolutely adored Ross, and treated him as if he was one of their own. Which included friendly bouts of Orc wrestling, although other races might not realize that such brutal combat was actually an Orc holding back. Ross likes to attribute this as to where his own strength and endurance originated from.  From the many tales of Cromarty's father of his life as an adventurer, the two boys soon left the army, instead joining up with a local adventurer's guild. The duo had quite their share of battles and riches, before a particularly nasty Ogre moved into the sewers of Almas. Ross and Cromarty paired up with a group of adventurers, who knew that few, if any, would make it out alive. But Ross and Cromarty were a bit more optimistic. The two would stride into each room, leather armor coated in sewer muck, their swords shining in the dark. The goblins, rats, and other foul creatures threw themselves at the party, but were cut down like lambs to slaughter. The party arrived nearly unscathed in Vorag the Butcher's grimy abode, but that's where things went horribly wrong.  Immediately attacked from behind by Vorag's elite guard, their party was quickly cut in half. The Butcher pushed Cromarty and two adventurers to the corner of the room, while Ross and the other three surviving adventurers desperately fought against a hungry encirclement of Goblin cannibals. Corpses littered the ground, only Ross remained standing against two Goblins, while Cromarty desperately parried Vorag's heavy blows, standing between the massive Ogre and the last remaining member of their party, a young Halfling sorceress who cowered in fear behind him.  Vorag's powerful swings knocked Cromarty's Greatsword from his hands, the metal clattering across the sewer cobbles before falling at the feet of the Goblins, who cheered loudly for their master. Ross shouted out to Cromarty, leaping forward and swinging his Bastard Sword with all his might, cleaving the first Goblin in two, his blade lodging into the second one's spine. Letting go of his sword as the Goblin staggered backwards, he turned, shouting again to Cromarty to run. He refused, boldly stairing straight at Vorag, his arms out at his side, shielding the halfling with his body. Vorag let out a bellow of laughter, before stabbing Cromarty through the chest, lifting the 220lb Orc into the air on his giant spiked meat cleaver before tossing his body aside like a rag doll.  His face numb, his hands shaking, Ross felt anger surge through his body. He grabbed his fallen friend's sword, feeling surprisingly light, hefting the 5 foot steel blade as if it were merely a toy, charging straight at the giant behemoth. Raising the cleaver above his head, he let out another bellow of triumphant laughter, the Halfling shrieking and closing her eyes, knowing she'd be cleaved in two.  The sound of flesh, severed by metal. Her heart pounded in her chest. Metal clattering against stone. She opened one eye, seeing the Ogre's hands still gripping his cleaver, yet lying several meters away. Turning her head slowly, she saw the Ogre stairing at his wrists, his tiny mind not comprehending what had happened. Between the bleeding stumps in front of them, a third object appeared. Steel. Pointed. Cold. And dripping with his own blood. Slumping to his knees, he suddenly realized that his time had come. He couldn't run, his lower body was done. He couldn't fight, hands he had none. The metal point protruding from his chest slid back inside of him, and then he realized he was rolling, his body still kneeling in the muck as he watched from a distance.  He couldn't do anything, his head was gone.  Kneeling beside his friend, Cromarty smiled up at him, nodding once to him, too weak to speak. Ross cradled the greatest friend and companion he ever had, who lay dying in his arms. Weeping openly, he tried to place the Greatsword in his friend's hand, but his Orc companion pushed it back, his hand instead grasping Ross's in a firm handshake, then pulling him into a powerful hug. He let out a soft, yet ragged sigh as his last breath left his body, his arms falling limp onto the cobblestone.  Ross held his limp body in that tight embrace, while the Halfling watched in silence, not wanting to interrupt his vigil. Finally, Ross stood up slowly, pulling the Orc's body onto his back, stopping only to grab Vorag's head by his greasy hair on the way out.  The surviving two brought back Vorag's head to the king, exchanging it for the payment they had been promised. Never saying a word, he divided the gold with the Halfling, and left.  Ross stopped by Cromarty's parents house, and spent every gold piece he earned from the job on a Warrior's Shrine, laying his friend to rest with all the supplies and weapons he could need for battle in the afterlife. He attempted to add the Greatsword to the grave, but Cromarty's father stopped him, explaining that an orc would pass his sword in his dying breath to those who shared his blood should they be with him.  Teardrops upon the stone floor were the last to be added to the shrine before the grave was sealed shut. Immense stone columns carried by other orcs of the city built up a barrier around and over the tomb, sealing off the shrine from the outside world.  Ross said goodbye to the only parents he had ever known, before leaving the city of Almas. Taking only his equipment, his armor, weapons, and Cromarty's Greatsword, he set off on a new adventure. While his thoughts are mostly on what lies ahead, he occasionally remembers his time adventuring with his Orc brother, and what the cost could be to find a way."

DnDGreentext,3d8qrp,Zwets,17,Tue Jul 14 13:23:21 2015 UTC,"It was after Claudio contracted the aforementioned disease that the DM told us I collapsed to the ground and started seizing.  Our dwarven barbarian (we'd gotten two new players to the group by now, totalling 4 players) decided to perform first-aid. He rolled a 1, so the DM described how the barb grabbed a fistful of gravel and just shoved it down my throat.  I started turning a darker and darker shade of blue until I finally managed to roll a decent FORT save, allowing me to overcome the disease temporarily and cough up the gravel."

DnDGreentext,3d3wna,noodlenova,7,Mon Jul 13 09:06:22 2015 UTC,I'm confused at this one.  How did you take the ring off without bad things happening?  How did the dude not just gut you right there and make the others finish up with the sacrifices?
DnDGreentext,3d3wna,Zefirus,15,Mon Jul 13 14:28:44 2015 UTC,"The ring was just an ordinary band of metal. It wasn't magical, or trapped in any way. The sorcerer won't kill us because we still have something he needs. Only we know where the surviving humans are. Our DM knows at this point that we would rather just be killed than give up their whereabouts, so I suppose we're just gonna have to come to some kind of other arrangement, but either way, we're pretty adamant that we're not giving him shit, and our DM knows it."
DnDGreentext,3d3wna,Zefirus,0,Mon Jul 13 14:44:23 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm just confused as to the purpose of the rings then, if they don't actually do anything.  Or how you being unbound is in any way different than being bound in this situation."
DnDGreentext,3d3wna,Panda_Boners,12,Mon Jul 13 15:00:42 2015 UTC,"He was trying to get us to do his bidding. He needs humans but doesn't know where they're all hiding. We DO know where they all are because we helped to hide them. He fitted us with ordinary rings but told us that bad shit would happen if we tried to take them off. Obviously he knew that they were just plain old rings, but we had no idea. He said ""Bring me the humans, I'll take the rings off for you. You have seven days. Try to take the rings off by yourself, or don't bring me the humans, and bad stuff happens"".  Now, I took the chance of beiting the ring off and spitting it at him because I would rather die than tell him where the humans are hiding. Not my most intelligent decision, but there we go. It paid off anyway because the rings was not trapped like I genuinely thought it was. Now the sourcerer understands that I would rather die than tell him where the humans are hiding, and so he must figure out another way of finding them, or forcing us to show him where they are."
DnDGreentext,3d3wna,Zefirus,10,Mon Jul 13 15:06:35 2015 UTC,"The Sorceror was bluffing, hoping that the PCs wouldn't try to take the rings off.  Because he wasn't bound he was able to take it off."
DnDGreentext,3d3dks,Charadin,9,Mon Jul 13 05:00:47 2015 UTC,"Well, that was some horse-shit! Paladin not saving people, though? Bit of a neigh-sayer on that idea."

DnDGreentext,3csufe,kaenneth,22,Fri Jul 10 15:59:40 2015 UTC,"So wait, how can you commit selfless deeds as a sword? Seems a little difficult to me unless you had telekinesis or some shit. And if it was the paladin committing the deeds, then wtf you didn't learn your lesson lol."
DnDGreentext,3csufe,kaenneth,17,Fri Jul 10 16:31:30 2015 UTC,"He had access to his spells, including telekinesis/levitation, and the ability to communicate with whoever holds/carries the sword at all times. It was an e-mail campaign, so being slightly less active that the other players was OK.  Good RP debates with the Paladin about how to deal with problems.... Fireballs can solve so many issues so easily..."

DnDGreentext,3cs2ti,ostreatus,3,Fri Jul 10 13:35:49 2015 UTC,Just post. Fuck the haters.
DnDGreentext,3cs2ti,ClassySavage,2,Fri Jul 10 15:41:01 2015 UTC,What the rest of them said.
DnDGreentext,3cs2ti,95wave,6,Fri Jul 10 16:03:43 2015 UTC,"You guys playing zap or what? With my group things rarely get this retarded.   Also, why are there children? Every clone is vat grown citizen! Are you a traitor?"
DnDGreentext,3cs2ti,95wave,2,Fri Jul 10 18:51:11 2015 UTC,"It's been a while, but it had to have been zap, yeah. We were just starting out on Paranoia, so the DM went with the lighter versions first. It also doesn't help that the group I used to play with were pretty prone to firing on each other, citizens, and anything around them. Pretty funny, though.  As for children...not sure about that, actually. Might have been an oversight on the behalf of the DM.  EDIT: Just to clarify, though, we don't usually play Zap. Most of the ridiculousness in our campaigns comes from the other players acting moderately retarded at the worst of times."
DnDGreentext,3cs2ti,95wave,2,Fri Jul 10 23:12:28 2015 UTC,"I guess our DM just wasn't good with coming up with things as creative as this. Best thing he's done was make me a clearance yellow (this happened after the story I posted here) and put my former team under me. As in, I wasn't out on the field with them but I gave them 'info' and had my own objectives. It was actually a lot of fun."
DnDGreentext,3cs2ti,John_Johnson,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:19:08 2015 UTC,"Huh, that actually sounds pretty cool. In our group, it was rare that anyone survived long enough to be promoted. I think one guy got to orange at one point."

DnDGreentext,3cqplz,zombiedodge,40,Fri Jul 10 00:32:06 2015 UTC,"It's worth pointing out that OMH was created as a reaction to a shitty DM and purpose built to completely derail the game.  ...in that respect, you wound up playing closer to OMH than they thought. Careful what you wish for and all that."
DnDGreentext,3cqplz,Irrefutably_Mortal,16,Fri Jul 10 01:11:26 2015 UTC,"True. Wanting to play epic should begin lowly in my opinion. And OMH is a really crappy ideal to strive for, since he was basically the in game version of a punch to the face for the crappy GM. Epic, yes, but not something you need if you want to play with a regular GM.   Besides, if your DM will just have a little leeway with player inventiveness, then you can do some pretty awesome inventiveness without breaking the game."
DnDGreentext,3cqplz,Khamero,4,Fri Jul 10 06:48:07 2015 UTC,"That's one reason why I feel like you should never show ""epic"" OMH-level stories to new players because they'll expect every game to be like that, or worse they'll create their characters to be like that. They don't see the value in detailed personality and good roleplay, all they see is ""Oh my god this guy blows everything up OMG it's hella funny"" and try to be the same. Naturally they fail to do so (because they never learned to roleplay properly, so how could they roleplay improperly to such perfection?), get fed up with the lack of results and ""boring"" gameplay, and just make everything sucky for everyone else and themselves."
DnDGreentext,3cqplz,MonkPreston,2,Fri Jul 10 06:56:31 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on how you show them it. I got one of my friends interested in Roleplaying through OMH, but made it pretty clear that it was a response to the shitty GM, and that stuff like that is usually the last resort in any situation.  Might also depend on the person reading it though."
DnDGreentext,3cqplz,FailcopterWes,2,Fri Jul 10 15:46:53 2015 UTC,"This guy has been somewhat seasoned and was playing long before me. I think he just read it and read it like /u/MonkPreston said and was like ""OMG. That is so clever. It has all my lulz. He is so cool. Everyone should RP as good and write 600 page back stories"""
DnDGreentext,3cqplz,Brendsmalls,3,Fri Jul 10 16:16:26 2015 UTC,"While a deliberate tpk isn't exactly OMH style hijinks, it certainly did it's job of pissing them off.

DnDGreentext,3cna05,SnappingSpatan,28,Thu Jul 9 05:52:38 2015 UTC,"Eh, I feel like a good DM should roll with it. If the group thinks of a way to make things significantly easier, that's fine and should be rewarded. If you punish creative problem solving the game becomes a slog of powerwanking combat."
DnDGreentext,3cna05,Vandelay_Latex_Sales,7,Thu Jul 9 15:48:47 2015 UTC,"He put a lot of effort into it, but he should have expected it, after all, I was the only one in the group to ever use creative problem solving"
DnDGreentext,3cna05,Backdoor_Man,14,Thu Jul 9 16:01:29 2015 UTC,"Ghost sound does not, as I understand, produce intelligible speech. That would be better than ventriloquism, a higher-level spell."
DnDGreentext,3cna05,CalebthePitFiend,18,Thu Jul 9 06:17:21 2015 UTC,"No, Ventriloqism is Language/voice based, Ghost Sound is literally any sound that 4 ppl/CL can create. From the spell description:  ""You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum 40 humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created."""
DnDGreentext,3cna05,Backdoor_Man,5,Thu Jul 9 06:46:49 2015 UTC,"First line is the actual description of the effects:   Ghost sound allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound ghost sound creates when casting it and cannot thereafter change the sound's basic character.   And, to shorten your quoted text to a relevant length and add my own emphasis:   Thus, talking sounds can be created.   Ventriloquism, as a 1st-level spell, can make the sound of your own voice saying something distinct at a distance. Why would it exists if ghost sound already does that at level 0?  Furthermore:   The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit.   Nothing about this says 'speech', while ventriloquism specifically notes it."
DnDGreentext,3cna05,CalebthePitFiend,4,Thu Jul 9 06:55:41 2015 UTC,"And literally nothing in Ghost Sound specifically says no speech. The only reason you would use Ventriloquism is for the higher DC.   besides, if it can imitate a sound as complex as forty people marching, it should be able to imitate speech."
DnDGreentext,3cna05,CalebthePitFiend,25,Thu Jul 9 07:07:21 2015 UTC,"For RPGs, the Devil is in the details, it states that it can make the sound of people talking, but does not specify how detailed it has to be, therefore, it was up to the DM to determine how effective it is, and he determined that it could imitate a full voice."
DnDGreentext,3cna05,redgarrett,7,Thu Jul 9 07:09:50 2015 UTC,Exactly the point I was trying to make only better. Thank you for being the concise one around here
DnDGreentext,3cna05,SheeEttin,10,Thu Jul 9 07:14:25 2015 UTC,"Glad we got that settled. Hey, uh... can I suggest you not use the code for big text? It's the same effect as typing in all caps, and I ASSUME YOU KNOW HOW BAD THAT IS. Your choice, obviously, but italics are probably a better way to emphasize things than all caps or header text."
DnDGreentext,3cna05,CalebthePitFiend,7,Thu Jul 9 14:44:53 2015 UTC,Yeah seriously. I'm on mobile and it makes the text at least twice as big.

DnDGreentext,3cna05,lifelongfreshman,2,Thu Jul 9 22:41:49 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, if you are in Pathfinder, the devil is also in the official FAQ. They agree with the person who started this comment chain."
DnDGreentext,3cna05,lifelongfreshman,5,Thu Jul 9 16:50:09 2015 UTC,"Rule Zero, bro. The description was ambiguous, and the DM interpreted the spell as he saw fit."
DnDGreentext,3cna05,manioo8,2,Thu Jul 9 16:58:51 2015 UTC,"While that is correct, there is an official rules clarification on the official site, and the DM may not have known about it.   I assume this whole thing was allowed after a conversation between you and him where you convinced him to allow it, yeah? If this information available to him, would he have still allowed it?  It's a good story regardless, but RAI matter just as much as RAW, and it's irksome when people use the poor wording in RAW to abuse systems."
DnDGreentext,3cna05,BlueCowDragon,2,Thu Jul 9 17:01:05 2015 UTC,"Nope, I asked him what he thought it would be interpreted as, and he said that I can use multiple of the 4 charges to imitate voices clearly, so that's that I did. No debate or coaxing."
DnDGreentext,3cna05,BlueCowDragon,5,Thu Jul 9 22:17:52 2015 UTC,"However, something on the official site does, in fact, clarify that it can't be intelligible speech."
DnDGreentext,3cna05,JasonEAltMTG,2,Thu Jul 9 16:54:09 2015 UTC,"Also, another reason to use ventriloquism is the fact that it last for 1 minute/level, while ghost sound is 1 round/level. Also, wax/wool is a smidgen harder to come by."
DnDGreentext,3cna05,JasonEAltMTG,2,Fri Jul 10 00:06:15 2015 UTC,That was actually really clever with directing all priests to the shrine. GG

join a seemingly random group of people at the assigned meeting place A blonde catches your eye, she's not overly beautiful, but you can't stop staring She is holding an ornate sword that could only be the fabled Sword of Eternal Endings, this must be the adventurer She notices your gaze and you suddenly become aware your mouth is open The party goes forth and begins correcting the wrongs secretly orchestrated by the Ultimate Evil Weeks of fighting and you've only now managed to learn some spells helpful to the party, really over your head with no idea why the Oracle summoned you to this party Every quest is more daring but the Adventurer always finds a way to drag the party from the brink on to victory She is so brave and determined, truly a hero worthy of song One of the party members fall on a particularly dangerous quest You do everything you can, but you just don't have the knowledge you need to keep him alive The Adventurer takes it hard, but after a few days she seems even more resolute You've inescapably fallen for her, a heroine like the ones you were told about before bed as a child, and seeing her sad like that makes you ache You begin to research more advanced spells in your free time, often losing sleep Quests become more and more dangerous, but the Adventurer is always a heartbeat quicker, a sword-stroke faster Another party member falls in the seemingly endless struggles, but the Ultimate Evil must be destroyed and you all fight on Several of the adventurers are discouraged and one becomes increasingly hostile to you as time goes on While all notice your comparatively low contribution to the group's now quite formidable ability, this mage continually reminds you what a 'bumbling idiot' you are compared to her Weeks go by and your research progresses, but not fast enough to save yet another party member felled in combat against a particularly perilous foe Your party eventually learns the location of the Ultimate Evil, only 5 of you left to face him, you being the least formidable There are seemingly endless minions between the party and its goal, but the Adventurer is too quick to be brought down It was tough fighting, but all made it to the Evil's Throne The mage was dead before any of you even saw what struck her This foe was unlike any the party had faced before and all were pushed to their absolute limits Victory seems close when your breath is caught in your throat The brave Adventurer is struck down before you, just the slightest bit too slow dodging a strike aimed at her head You cry out and run to her, the mortal danger involved not even registering in your brain While the other party members draw the Evil away, you hold the only woman you've ever loved though she barely even noticed you She lay limp, unconscious in your arms as her lifeblood drains from such a small cut in her neck After a few helpless seconds looking into those deep green eyes, you feel her breathe her last It can't end like this, it wont end like this You quickly pour over your unfinished and unpracticed spells and start on one you think could bring your love back to you as you bind the wound on her neck The effort completely drains you, but after a few moments that feel like years you see the Adventurer's eyes refocus You've done it, the hero lives, this is why the Oracle chose you Movement in the corner of your eye brings you back to the reality you've been ignoring It was one of the other party members flying into a wall, blood spilling from half a dozen wounds After a few panicked seconds you notice the only other party member impaled on the Ultimate Evil's claws You shake the Adventurer and shout at her to wake and take up her sword again to defeat this evil once and for all She lurches out of your arm and rushes the evil head on You notice her movements are somewhat odd and pray other unnoticed injuries wouldn't hinder her excessively Words could not describe the epic duel that transpired that day, the heroine never fought so vigorously and with such intensity It was a struggle to stay conscious after the spell, but you somehow managed and saw the blow that ended the beast You were so alleviated until she looked at you, something was wrong Her face was expressionless, those green eyes staring right through you Then you noticed she wasn't breathing You had been so desperate to save her you didn't fully think it through You had restored her body, but not her soul The weight of this realization pulled you down to the stone where you lay for some time inconsolable and devoid of any hope Hours later you compose yourself enough to stand and change the wrappings on the hero's mortal remains to remove any evidence of injury You are only one left living that saw the brave Adventurer fall and you will take this secret with you to the grave You will find a way to return her soul to her body if it takes you a thousand years Nothing, not even death will keep you from fulfilling this task, this you swear   Credit goes to /u/tehblackknight for his marvelous contribution to the story over on r/dnd"

Then he gets mad when npc's retaliate"
DnDGreentext,3c61gj,You_Stealthy_Bastard,28,Sun Jul 5 06:13:45 2015 UTC,"Isn't that evil? I always assumed a neutral is someone that looks for his best interest first or doesn't align to the evil or bad, a little mind my own business type of attitude. While the chaotic means he doesn care about law, just a spontaneous kind of attitude.  I don't see how trying to create an undead army isn't straight up evil."
DnDGreentext,3c61gj,esmifra,18,Sun Jul 5 13:40:50 2015 UTC,Chaotic means that you are against the statue quo... Neutral means you dont care how it is done.  That PC is straight up evil.
DnDGreentext,3c61gj,HeresWaldorf,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:47:50 2015 UTC,"The way this ""chaotic neutral"" guy was doing it; yes it is evil.  There are non-evil ways, though (if the DM allows that reanimation of the dead is not evil per se, but depends more on the way you do it).  Using ""Speak with the dead"" to ask dead warriors to rise again and protect their living descendants would be considered an act of good by most DMs (that put RP before the formal rules).  ...also, reanimating enemies you killed in self defense as compensation for attacking you may not be as good-aligned as burying them, but it can hardly be considered evil.  ...alsox2, if someone voluntarily wanted to become undead to do good, then even if casting the reanimation spell itself was evil, the good that person does with his new undead powers kinda negates it.

I'm currently playing a second campaign with her (I don't care for her or her attitude, but the GM is fun and I get to play with a number of international players). The first campaign with her was Skull and Shackles, a Pathfinder pirate AP. She played a TN Clouded-vision Oracle, which wouldn't have been so bad if not for a number of reasons.   1: she was the pilot of the ship... A woman who can only see 30ft-60ft was the pilot/captain of the ship. 2: While a TN pirate is totally absurd, she didn't play the character as a pirate nor as true neutral. She played a fucking LG marine on a pirate ship. 3: Her idea of what a pirate is is highly romanticize as some samurai of the sea, that has some Code of Honor to follow and that they aren't criminals... I'm sorry, what?   Yeah... She is... Off... Thankfully, her current character is more in line with the campaign and not quite so... Well, I was going to say bullshit, but no, her character is bullshit. It's a custom race that can fly, gets the Healing Hex, and can fire arrows through 5ft doorways when she is 10ft in the air."
DnDGreentext,3c2h15,Sir_Rhallington,5,Mon Jul 6 19:33:43 2015 UTC,Nautically incompetent captain...curiously good aligned pirate...absurdly romanticized view of pirating.  Did she perhaps vows to her adopted sibling that she was going to become king of the pirates and acquire the one piece by any chance?
DnDGreentext,3c2h15,NarcolepticDraco,2,Tue Jul 7 10:30:29 2015 UTC,"LOL! I love One Piece. At least Luffy and his Crew are Chaotic Good or at the very least Chaotic Neutral.

(If it was a one shot then fine) This will allow the audience to grow more attached to the character, and grow to understand their personalities more (the sitting knight seems like a real character, I only scratched the surface of him, I kinda want more stories about him) Maybe give a few blurbs about the donkey to make people like it more.  The lines about the barbarian are pretty good, but what about the other party members, how do they fit in? Do they try to sabotage your 'steed' at any point? Does the DM attempt to (For dramatic effect, not to be a that DM)? Does the villian show up earlier? Maybe add a bit to that guys character, to make the duel more symbolic. Cause, that duel was actually quite symbolic.  The character in general is interesting, I'm not quite convinced you didn't take this out of a tg create a character session. Sure as hell crazy enough As for actual writing tips... you are asking the wrong guy. I didn't have any real issues with the writing. Lastly, did this session end or is it ongoing?

I can't wait for another flaming tree ent to chase us because I won a drinking contest against the dwarf and dared him to shoot it.
DnDGreentext,3b7u48,Time2Nuke,14,Fri Jun 26 22:24:02 2015 UTC,"Probably the best rule bending and pushing the DM to allow it to work that I caused recently was we were battling a dryad at like level 2 or something and I didn't want to die. I summoned a mount via the spell and convinced the DM that since I can ride it, it has to be physical, but it just magical, so it doesn't actually feel pain. He agreed that that seemed to be true, so I threw my sack on the horse, ignited the sack with a tinder twig, and sent it walking towards the tree. He died from fire by the time he reached the tree, but then the flaming sack fell on the tree and due to dry grass and it being near fall, the fallen leaves, grass, and tree went up in flames as we ran away from the dryad laughing. The DM just glared at me for the rest of the combat and escape because the dryad had no means of creating water and I had defeated his boss using a sack, a mount spell, and a tinder twig. Mounts were no longer allowed to carry anything but people and once you got off of them, they disappeared."

But I'm modifying her to be a multiclassing thief/mage. So she can have fortitude targeting spells to help slow and stop enemies she wants to take out. Of course kel is her tank so he takes most the damage. I just made the mistake of staying to close to the illithid last campaign and now have a baby parasite in my brain. so you know.

There's always issues when you reverse the onus of proof (making it the accused's job to prove that they're innocent), but there's one that particularly stands out in this context.  Consent isn't material.  It leaves no physical evidence. It is not something you can touch, observe, or scrutinize. It exists between people engaging in sexual activity; the moment you take it out of that context, it ceases to exist. You cannot search somebody's apartment for the missing consent. You cannot chemically analyze consent in a lab. It leaves no fucking trace at all.  Trying to make accused sexual offenders guilty until proven innocent is fucking disgusting. It's a perversion of the legal system, and nothing less."

Not having followed the rules of the charter doesn't prove anything.  Having a system to report problems that was not utilized gives the accused some measure of defense in that it puts doubt onto the accuser.  The story doesn't detail how the charges were finally dropped (likely because the details were not given to the students), so all we can reasonably assume was that this was the first step in wedging doubt into the accusers' stories which then snowballed into an ultimate drop of accusations.  Judging by punishment given to the accusers, some likely confessed to wrongdoing, thus exonerating the accused completely."

To use a specific example,    I ask them what they do when they realize the shuttle hasn't been called Doc's player decides that Aimy irrationally blames Tink for not thinking of it sooner Tink's player ponders whether it would be funnier to let that lie, or to antagonize her, then leads a group effort to think of what the most assholish response would be. ""Skunk-haired-super-bitch"" is arrived at. Doc's player announces Aimy's intention to beat the shit of Tink for that one Tink's player decides Tink will run away while whooping like zoidberg, but I make him roll initiative, he loses Doc's player vaguely describes how Aimy is totally kicking Tink's ass, Twitch's player suggests that she is forcing him to eat dirt and asking ""who's the bitch now"" Hilarity Ensues While some of the players continue to discuss what sort of semi-witty responses, and pleas for mercy Tink might make, I ask Nubby's player what he's doing...."

The core healing system involves rolling a Medicae Test (With various skills and pieces of gear giving bonuses, and the amount of damage on the target giving maluses) If you succeed in the roll, then you remove damage based on how well you passed the roll and your Int. There's a bunch more complex stuff about extended care and treating criticals, and there's a rule that says you can only first-aid someone once every 24 hours (which is a VERY lazy rule), all of which I tend to ignore in favor of a little more DM effort.   I make sure everyone tracks how they're taking damage, and Doc's player has to tell me what he does to fix it (Bandage, transfusion, splint, etc.). Then rolling happens, with the only real difference being that I allow a general first-aid test per-bodypart  per-deployment. Critical damage healing is done case-by-case, as is anything involving a medbay.  As for Twitch's stuff, that is so non-standard it's almost freeform. At the core explosive damage per kilogram is 3d10+2 over 5 meters, and setting it up uses Tech-Use. The only real by-the-book modification on top of that is using the list of grenade and missile types as a basis for what kinds of bombs he can make... Like I said though, it's mostly handwaving. He'll announce his intention to make something go boom, prove to me that he has the supplies to do so, then I'll just have him do a roll based on how hard or easy I think it should be. Then there may or may not be an argument over how full of shit I am.   So yea, it's all rather arbitrary."

Firstly I wanted to leave out any other inquisition people, and it was hard to justify a DW killteam coming out without some Inquisitorial support tagging along.  Secondly, this was inspired by the rather annoying ""fetch me a Tyranid"" missions the Inquisition gives Chapters in the Chapter Master game. The question of why they don't use DW marines is avoided there as well.  Thirdly, I ran across their backstory and decided they were a really cool chapter for this sort of thing.

DnDGreentext,3ahrra,punkrocklee,2,Sun Jun 21 12:34:07 2015 UTC,The ends do not justify the means for good characters in pathfinder. Animating dead is an evil act even if you are doing it to get the orphanage their gardener back so they can get proper nutrition that still requires you to become neutral in order to actually cast the spell. This is all mechanical and not up for debate.  And isnt the punisher motivated by revenge quite a bit? More lawful neutral i would say.
DnDGreentext,3ahrra,Morbidmort,2,Fri Jun 26 00:21:22 2015 UTC,"I don't like mechanics that limit players along arbitrary lines. Necromancy is just magic involving death, a wholly natural part of the world. too much life is cancer, and casting a spell to cause huge amounts of cancer would be evil, and the antithesis of necromancy."
DnDGreentext,3ahrra,punkrocklee,3,Fri Jun 26 01:49:07 2015 UTC,Raising undead in pathfinder involves torturing the soul of the being you raise. As such it is always an evil action if playing RAW in PF. Of course you can houserule that you can make good necromancy by asking nicely or maybe just attaching a part of your own mind/soul to the corpse. But that is your houserule then.

DnDGreentext,3afr9v,methuzia,25,Fri Jun 19 21:08:47 2015 UTC,"A) You can officially not crit or critfail a skill check. However, most DM's take natural 1s or 20s into account. According to the rules, I'd just miss the damn tiger. I got literally slammed out of the air by a massive claw though, which nearly knocked me out cold (and I actually got knocked out when a party member punched my face a few hours later. Long story.)  B) As far as I know you can always make oppurtunity attacks as long as you're not prevented by things like surprised or stunned. But you can do it right after starting combat.  However, OAs might work a little different in 5e and pathfinder. In 5e you can make OAs when someone gets out of melee range without disengaging, I do not know how PF AoOs work"

Also, disengaging is something different than a five foot step I think. In 5e you can freely walk circles around enemies, as long as you ""hug"" them. If you use the disengage action, you can just walk away your full move. A five foot step sounds the same as 4es ""shifting"", where you don't provoke AoOs by moving only 5ft"

DnDGreentext,3a7pjx,Jagd3,6,Fri Jun 19 18:39:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't have any saved pics, but I can tell you the tale of my ascension. To give a little backdrop about the setting, it was like if generic 3.5 and the setting of Codex Alera fucked and had an awesome baby.  So there were no gods, and magic was rare.  With a little sweet talking and some good roles, I convinced my DM to let me play a Dread Necromancer, at the expense of being one of the giant dog men in the setting called a Cain because in setting they have a magical tradition.  Also, all of the players had what are called furies, elementals that you could tame and let you do all sorts of crazy shit related to the elements   As I said above, magic was super-duper rare, even among Cain.  Maybe one shaman or wizard in a medium tribe, and at most two in a major outpost.  Necromancy was even rarer and practically unheard of except by very old practitioners of magic, like shit that these guys whisper about when their drinking.  So its 110% unheard of by any of the other races.  Queue the rest of the party, a LG Human Samurai, a LG Hound Archon Monk, a CN Halfling Rogue, and me a LE 7ft tall dog man with black fur Necromancer.  Yeah, shenanigans inbound.  At first there wasn't a whole lot of shenanigans because I didn't have any of those sweet undead making spells, so from everybody else's perception I was just some sort of entropy mage that they've heard so much about from those weird tribes who decided to help the cause.  The cause is more or less, stop total annihilation of the world by a bug race called the Vord, nasty bugs that can take over your mind all body snatchers style and can use fury craft at the level of whoever they took over.  Aside from playing the war from within angle, some of them are just giant bruisers who could tear you apart with their mandibles and came in every bug shape you could imagine, but meaner.  So everybody had a stake in the game more or less.  By level 7 we've cleared out several nests of Vord, our favorite tactic was to throw a few jars of oil with lit fuses deep into the cave and watching the green shit they nest in burn like tinder after sealing up all the other holes with our samurai's earth crafting.   At this point we've been recognized as  bad asses by the emperor, and are given a special mission deep into the Feverthorn Jungle, which as legend would have it, nobody has ever came back out alive.  So of course we accept!  Were looking for some sort of temple that was said to have some sort of super weapon inside that the good ole' emperor wanted to use to fight the Vord.  At this point the samurai is starting to have doubts about my wholesomeness as my spells have gotten progressively nastier and nastier and he watched me drain the life out of a guy with my charnel touch.  In the temple, we do in fact find some distinctly not normal things.  Like ancient warriors that wanted to test our honor through combat, and lots and lots of traps. Most interesting though was an ancient mage we killed after he tried to bushwhack us with a lightning bolt.  The samurai, who gave the killing blow to the mage tried to grab his staff and was promptly shot against the wall and took few d6 damage.  Being the inquisitive mage I am being faced with something new and strange, I decided to poke it with a stick and touched it, but slowly.    Much to my surprise, it talked to me and introduced him/itself as Anak-un-Rahmen, and informed me that I was its new master as I was the only one smart enough to wield its power.  This pleased Graadash as it stroked his ego.  Anak-un-Rahmen wasn't lying when it said it was powerful, I was wielding a living McGuffin.  With a good roll, I could augment my spells, shoot blasts from the black jewel at its top; it was more or less Gandalf's Staff.   Everybody found these strange weapons that attuned to them, like they were waiting to be claimed for a greater purpose.    After a long, harrowing fight with some sort of mummy at the center of the temple, we were all warped into some sort of fucked up fever dream and woke up outside the temple with our new companions by our side and fought through a small army of raptors native to the jungle and made it back to the capital.  At this point we have a time skip because the DM wanted to boost us to the big leagues for the final chapters.  I've glossed over some details because this is running long as is and the rest wasn't very interesting.  Come back next session as level 15s and seasoned Vord Hunters, and personal kill squad of the empire.    Emps has a new job for us, a town to the North hasn't sent in any taxes in 3 months, highly irregular as they were a loyal mining town with a very healthy economy.  Were sent to make sure it wasn't a Vord attack.  We arrive and it was a ghost town, but no bugs in sight.  With some investigation, the samurai finds a trap hole about 4 miles from the mountain the gold mine is located in.  By stepping on it.  It’s also worth mentioning that we have a second rogue as a part time player at this point, he's important later.  Seeing our dearest friend go screaming down a tunnel in the ground, we do the only rational thing and jump in after him.   cont.  Its a long one."
DnDGreentext,3a7pjx,Graadash,6,Thu Jun 18 10:22:31 2015 UTC,"Turns out, this is a kobold den.  And this kobold clan was led by a great wyrm red dragon.  We discovered this because at the end of the tunnel we went falling down was a giant metal cage that we fell into and through a series of complicated pulleys took us right to it.  After a few minutes of discussion about the merits of not eating us, he decided he was going to eat us.  It should be explained that fury craft has lots of uses outside of just manipulating the elements.  For example, water craft can read minds and heal, fire craft can lower and raise temperature and incite anger, and earth... Well earth can incite carnal desire in others.  Thinking quickly, our new rogue uses earth craft to get the dragon horny, thinking that by seducing it he can buy us some time to escape and mount a rescue operation.  He of course rolled a 20 on the fuck a dragon check, because of fucking course he did.  Turns out the dragon was male, and he wasn't shapeshifting smaller.  So yeah, in one of the least proud moments of my buddy Tyler's D&D career, he got brutally fucked by a dragon, and coated in dragon jizz.  But the DM was kind enough to give him the half dragon template for being a good sport and for being cocooned in dragon jizz.  This ended up saving the day.  Satisfied, the dragon went to sleep back in the main chamber, deciding to eat us when it woke.    It was at this time I decided was now or never, I spoke to Anak-un-Rahmen about boosting my death spell.  And rolling the second 20 of the session and the DM rolling a 1, we decided that we were able to boost it enough to overpower the dragon’s fortitude and killed it, at the cost of Anak-un-Rahmen temporarily asserting his will into mine, making my reserved necromancer cackle madly as I'm shooting a green bolt of energy at the dragon; Alerting all the kobolds in the cave.  Once again, thinking quickly our new rogue in his new half dragon glory and washed off, runs to the front of the cave and pretend to be their master shapeshifted.  With a few bluff checks and a convincing speech, the buy it.  Graadash, seeing a perfect corpse lying at his feet decides it’s time to take the plunge into full on necromancy and raises the once mighty red dragon into a dracozombie.  The good aligned members of the party question it of course, but since they know nothing of magic, I was able to pass it off as a side effect of my goal of finding a cure for death.  I hadn't mastered the process yet, but I had found some use for my failures.  I had the dragon clear out the rest of the cave with a few breath attacks and I animated the kobolds to work the mines for me and made the most efficient gold mine in the kingdom.  I had my dragon eat its horde and we rode on its back all the way back to the capitol, where we were highly rewarded and for getting rid of such a massive threat and securing it as a weapon for the empire allowed to keep its riches.  At this point Graadash starts plotting, lichdom and the immortality that comes with it aren’t far off, but he has grander plans.  In his studies he found books that had talked of beings above mortals that had existed before but didn't now called Gods.  That was his goal. But for now he had to wait for the right opportunity.  Several levels of adventures and a few new Vord skeleton body guards later, opportunity reared its majestic head in the form of a zombie infestation in a town nearby.  And the rest of the party was on some other mission, so I was sent to take care of this while they took care of that.  Seeing how ripe for abuse this was, I cast Hide from Undead on myself and walked to the most reinforced building, the Town Hall.  Once I was let inside I started preaching about the great god Anak-Un-Rahmen, who through him I walked through the scourge untouched, and by giving him their praise, they could as well.  A few live volunteers and some convincing speeches later, I had my first congregation.  I cleared the zombies away with a few ""purifying blasts"" from Anak-un-Rahmen and the prayers started coming it.  The religion spread like wildfire, with stories being blown out of proportion with every telling.  All I had to do was show up and preform some ""miracles"" and the hype sustained itself.  With Anak-un-Rahmen storing the power of the prayers within him until it built to critical mass for true godhood for me.  Skip ahead a year in game, we all made it to level 20, and the final battle is upon us.  We found the main Vord Queen's hive, and we were gearing up for a full frontal assault on it.  It was a long, grueling battle through the hive, the Vord knew our tactics and all of our tricks.  Fire only served to burn away the nesting, the queen had surrounded her pawns in an air shield that kept the flames at bay, which was bad news because that meant that she was a powerful crafter on top of being a mean bitch physically.  After burning through spells, and wearing out or McGuffin weapons near to their maximum output, and some creative earth and metal crafting on the samurai and the rogue's part we made it to the bitch.  We honestly thought this would be the end, bad end.  Vord wins, do not pass go do not collect $200.  But we managed to grasp victory from the jaws of defeat in a daring suicide move.  We were going to focus as much power from our artifacts as they could pump out, hoping that it would work.  If not, we were doomed.  Anak-un-Rahmen and I volunteered as I had recently achieved lichdom, which the rest of the part didn't know, to be at the front of the blast.  I managed to trap her in some Black Tentacles for long enough for it to work, and boy did it work.  It opened up the equivalent of a magical worm hole, sucking the queen and Graadash along with her, into its maw.    It was then we decided that now would be the time to unleash all that prayer juice into me, we weren't sure if I would be able to recover from the unstable magical nonsense I was about to subject myself to.  Luckily it did work, at the cost of entering a fugue state for the next 1,000 years, adventuring through the cosmos as the realms one and only god.  MFW I became a god in a setting with no gods"

DnDGreentext,3a4gqa,Sebws,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:47:45 2015 UTC,"Like a lot of people, I too understand what humor is. And okay, I understand if you're trying to give this person the benefit of the doubt. But there are a lot of things that go into making an edgy joke funny, including:   Who you are/if the joke applies to you, the comedian Who your audience is How relevant it is today Your delivery   For reasons such as these Mel Brooks is a comedic genius (e.g. Space Balls, A Brief History of the World Part 1, The Producers) even though his work was relatively soon after the holocaust. And for these reasons OP is a dickhead, because they're raping someone else without explicitly being a survivor themselves, their audience (me) is aware of the seriousness of sexual assault in the US and how it is often downplayed, and they're just saying ""look I raped him but he likes it, isn't that funny?""  I mean if you need any more explanation after that, you're either a total psychopath or you're just not engaging in empathy."
DnDGreentext,3a4gqa,Gakukun,2,Wed Jun 24 22:01:12 2015 UTC,"Which is why i said the joke was in poor taste. The settings werent perfect for it. However, it was said during a game of imaginative role-playing around a captured bandit. Grim jokes are more excusable in such situations. Also, it is very much implied that a person saying such a joke would never in fact commit such an act.   I would definitively cut someone out of my life if i found out they raped someone. A person joking(with a clearly ironic undertone) about raping a bandit is however not someone i'd cut contact with, id probably give the person a look telling them ""oh really, that's what you want to do?"" but not much more. And if the DM rolled a crit, and told him he had a new friend, you bet your ass i would laugh.   It's really about not letting things offend you when you know they are not meant to be offending."

According to George Carlin, anything can be funny given the proper context and exaggeration (his example was Porky Pig raping Elmer Fudd.)  How about an adventurer killing a bugbear mid orgy, then the bugbear's 4 goblin wives huddling up, declaring ""you keep what you kill!"" and mobbing the adventurer with dirty trick maneuvers (to pants him) in an attempt to continue their previous orgy with their new alpha, failing horribly.   Is this worth a giggle, or was it a step too far?  Sidenote: before anyone asks, pantsing someone is a legit use of the Dirty Trick Maneuver.   You can attempt to hinder a foe in melee as a standard action....  Examples include kicking sand into an opponent’s face to blind him for 1 round, pulling down an enemy’s pants to halve his speed, or hitting a foe in a sensitive spot to make him sickened for a round."

He min-maxes like crazy but he's so afraid of losing his character that whenever we run into a situation that his character is not optimized for, his character hangs back and cowers like a little bitch.  Meanwhile my wizard is right at the front of the battle cracking skulls and taking names, because I'm role-playing him like the suicidal maniac that he is.  For example, I once wanted to distract an adult Blue Dragon from another target, so I cast magic missile into its face repeatedly until it lightning blasted me from full hp into unconsciousness with one hit (and came close to killing me from massive damage rules).  But at the end of the day, my risk taking makes my character look totally badass, while he never gets to look cool in comparison due to constantly running away from overpowered threats, and I think that he hates that my character overshadows his, even though it's his own fault."

DnDGreentext,39px27,BhiQ,36,Sun Jun 14 01:48:09 2015 UTC,I'm more of a fan of realistic magic.   Interesting
DnDGreentext,39px27,KodiakAnorak,7,Sun Jun 14 06:56:33 2015 UTC,"Well, realistic in itself. I love the magic in Eragon for example because the book explains the workings and limits of it quite well.   On the other hand I don't like the magic in Harry Potter because there's hardly any information about the creation of spells or their limits for example."
DnDGreentext,39px27,BhiQ,10,Sun Jun 14 12:52:43 2015 UTC,"I liked Eragon's magic at first, but in later books they were just doing so much shit it felt like Paolini was just letting them do whatever the shit they felt like.  Same with Harry Potter, to be honest. In the first book it's pretty simple. You use a certain wand gesture and say a certain word, and then a certain bit of magic happens. Later on they're casting spells without words, and any notion of wand gestures is completely gone. The movies were even worse in this, because it was like the third film when they stopped having to say the spell to do magic.  But I agree with your general point. The argument ""oh but it's a fantasy world, it has magic"" when someone says they find a world unbelievable, is a total cop out. A world with a good magic system should be internally consistent, and should feel logical to the reader."
DnDGreentext,39px27,Zagorath,10,Sun Jun 14 16:26:08 2015 UTC,"Quick question to you and others reading this: anyone know of any good books where the magic system is internally consistent? That sort of setting is by far my favorite type of fantasy to read, and I've been looking for one for quite some time. The most recent ones I've read would be the Coldfire Trilogy, by C.S. Friedman. I know this is a question better suited for /r/books, but I figured I'd try anyway."
DnDGreentext,39px27,TwirlyMustachio,9,Mon Jun 15 18:38:43 2015 UTC,"By internally consistent, I assume you mean what Sanderson would call ""hard"" magic? Something with strict rules that are mostly consistently applied? As opposed to the more vague and mysterious magics used in things like Lord of the Rings or A Song of Ice and Fire? Because strictly speaking, even soft magics can be internally consistent. With only a few exceptions, ASoIaF is actually pretty damn consistent, it's just vague and not precisely understood.  I haven't read his works, but Sanderson claims his own magics are ""perhaps 80% hard, maybe a bit more"", so they may be to your taste. Similarly, I've not read it, but what I've heard leads me to believe that the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan is a pretty hard magic system.  Outside of books, comic books are absolutely terrible, but TV shows based on comic book characters tend to be really good, in terms of consistency. Young Justice is one of my favourites. And I would highly recommend Avatar: The Last Airbender, which I consider the prime example of a ""hard"" magic system."
DnDGreentext,39px27,Zagorath,3,Mon Jun 15 22:08:34 2015 UTC,"After reading the link you provided, I would say yes, I prefer fantasy on the side of hard magic. I do like the sense of wonder Tolkien creates with his mysteriously powerful beings, but magic explained almost at a scientific level greatly intrigues me. I don't know how spoilers work in this subreddit, so I won't bother trying to use an example from the trilogy I mentioned.  What I will say is that I've seen (and loved) both ATLA and LOK, and I agree that its ""hard magic"" system is amazing. It's very consistent, but still leaves room for growth and mystery. It has limitations, strengths and weaknesses, an excellent ensemble of characters, history, etc. It's definitely a good example of Sanderson's hard magic.  I also liked the Black Jewels trilogy, by Anne Bishop, as a hard-ish magic story, if anyone's familiar with her work."

DnDGreentext,39px27,xakh,2,Mon Jul 20 05:26:53 2015 UTC,"I definitely never would've found it without a professor recommending it. I feel like I never give good book reviews, but my personal opinion is that the trilogy was really decent. Except for maybe one tiny bump, the novels were really good at operating ""sensibly"" within the constraints set up by the book's world. It rarely, if ever, creates dissonance with the reader by introducing a plot device that fails to fit in with the preceding narrative of the story. The third book slightly alters the delivery of the narrative, but again, not in a jarring manner.  I also think that C.S. Friedman did a pretty decent job with her character development. It isn't a unique development by any means, but it happens naturally, I'd argue. I'd definitely give the trilogy another shot if you have the time, if only to see how the story pans out."

Each of his 'cosmere' books/series has its own internally consistent magic system. Mistborn and stormlight archives are the big ones, but warbreaker and elantris have really interesting concepts.   Another series whose system at first doesnt' seem to fit this criteria, but becomes more clear as time goes on, is the Malazan book of the fallen by steven erikson. It starts out much more like LotR or GoT in transparency, but gets more clear as you go. A warning though - these are incredibly heavy reading. Very dense, and with a particular style that many struggle with.   Malazan actually started out as the author'd dnd setting with his freinds though, so it has that going for it."

DnDGreentext,39px27,BhiQ,4,Sun Jun 14 20:07:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know it was. I just didn't entirely agree with your specific example.  On another note, you might find Brandon Sanderson's Essays of the Laws of Magics interesting. In particular, the first law, which can be summarised by:   An author’s ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic.   Which explains more about how both early Eragon's magic system, but also the really vague and slightly less clear systems used in Lord of the Rings or A Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones can be considered good magic systems."
DnDGreentext,39px27,Zagorath,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:22:53 2015 UTC,"I haven't read the ""supporting"" books to LotR so I can't really talk about it but honestly I didn't really think that late Eragon was that bad.   They went to pretty high levels, basically using the power of dragon souls to enhance their magic. These seemed like pretty serious sources of magic so ""doing whatever the shit they felt like"" seemed pretty adequate tbh ;)  And GoT magic is pretty mysterious even now so I actually don't think we can tell if it's a good or bad system at this point."
DnDGreentext,39px27,BhiQ,5,Sun Jun 14 20:39:45 2015 UTC,"And GoT magic is pretty mysterious even now   Yeah that's the point of Sanderson's First Law. You can have mysterious magic that's used sparingly, like in LotR and ASoIaF, or you can have really strict magic that's used frequently: my favourite example of this is in Avatar, where their powers are basically to manipulate their element. Pretty standard, and very clear to the audience.  Game of Thrones rarely uses magic for anything important to the narrative, and when it does, it's fairly simple. We've seen Dany survive fire, we've seen the shadow baby, and we've seen some minor tricks from the warlocks of Qarth. That's pretty much it as far as things that are definitively magic. Because the magic system has been used sparingly, it's a well thought-out system."

DnDGreentext,39px27,RichardVagino,3,Sun Jun 14 01:58:06 2015 UTC,"I'd think each skeleton sorcerer would have a Mana or magic limit so they could only do a few summons  in a row. Cast time should figure into it too.  Do the summoned beings need to originate from a skeleton or soul, or they're just called into existence from another plane? If it was the first one, you'd run out of corpses/skeletons eventually. A creature that can summon it's equal is kinda OP, in my opinion."

DnDGreentext,39px27,JustJonny,7,Sun Jun 14 12:14:00 2015 UTC,"It's a great story, but it seems to be based on a math error.  If each skeleton reproduces only once, it would be linear (but still rapid) growth, but not exponential.    If I recall correctly, one D&D round is ten seconds, so this mess is only spawning 8640 skeletons per day.    It's a bad situation, and that town is doomed, but they probably wouldn't swarm across the earth, since sooner or later a dragon or similarly powerful creature will be around where they're reproducing, and it only takes one to be killed before summoning the next to break the chain.  Now if each summoned two, that's where the real trouble starts.  Edit: I missed the ""each"", I was wrong.  I thought it was 1+1+1, not 1X2X2."
DnDGreentext,39px27,DunDunDunDuuun,15,Sun Jun 14 01:21:49 2015 UTC,"He says ""each of skeleton sorcerors summon another"". So it's safe to say it's exponential."
DnDGreentext,39px27,RichardVagino,10,Sun Jun 14 01:27:24 2015 UTC,"It is exponential.  you start with 1 skeleton. It makes another, so you have 2. Each of those makes one each, so you have 4. The progression is as follows  1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 16 -> 32 etc etc  If you were to make it a function, it would be y=2x-1 where x is the round (so in the first round, there is 1 skeleton)."

DnDGreentext,39px27,Seyon,5,Fri Jun 19 02:48:16 2015 UTC,I'd say that being adrift in a mountain of skeletons would make you unable to properly cast the spell.  Doesn't being flat footed matter in spell casting?
DnDGreentext,39px27,Puresowns,2,Sun Jun 14 05:34:44 2015 UTC,"Depends on the spell components, and if the skeletons could ignore them through feats or abilities."

Rather than simply railroad them away from their wagons he should've given them quests that would appeal to them: go after these bandits because they've been raiding the farms that produces your stock, if no one stops the BBEG then the roads won't be safe and you'll lose business, the evil lord has raised tolls and you need to replace him to travel through his lands profitably, a gang is extorting you for protection money, that sort of thing. But yeah, DM should've used plot hooks, not punishments."
DnDGreentext,395ku6,NoNadir,32,Tue Jun 9 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"When you put it like that, the DM sounds just flat out incompetent. That would have been amazing."

DnDGreentext,395ku6,alias-of-a-girl,7,Wed Jun 10 17:39:07 2015 UTC,"I consider the actively malicious ones to be merely incompetent, because they clearly don't understand the DM is part of the group. It's not a case of ""us vs DM"" or ""me vs them"", D&D should be about the group working together with the DM to create a story and an adventure that everyone wants to be a part of. Sometimes, yeah, that means the DM is gonna be an asshole to the players, but a good DM should know whether their players are willing to participate in something like that.  Although, I should definitely add inexperienced to the list of categories, because expecting a new DM to know about all the options they have available to them is silly."
DnDGreentext,395ku6,lifelongfreshman,44,Wed Jun 10 18:00:37 2015 UTC,"At the very least, if the DM wasn't willing to change things to accomodate the entrepreneur character, he could have asked the player to play something more adventury and kept the other character as an actual NPC.

One of the best was the time we were on a side road on the way back from stymieing an encroaching tribe of orcs; the wagon train got mired in mud during a thunderstorm, and lightning broke the horses loose. The cleric dropped an Animate Objects to let it shake itself loose, quote, ""like the Totoro catbus"", then once that wore out, started handing out Bull's Strengths like candy so we could haul it back to the highway ourselves. We were game to keep pulling, but what a crazy random happenstance, the wheels all broke. We camped overnight, and in the morning we cannibalized the bar, nailed the flat boards that were the countertops in place of the wheels, while the Wizard prepared a couple castings of Mount to get us horses to pull the newborn sleigh, and like a dozen castings of Grease to keep it moving over rough spots. We were, of course, attacked by highwaymen, the DM probably seeing his chance with the Wizard's spell slots occupied with this dumb nonsense, but the Cleric, Barbarians, and Paladin were having none of that that day.  Their blood made excellent sleigh lubricant."

Rival caravans and stuff. How can the DM not want to get in on / develop something people are clearly having so much fun with?  If he didn't like you sitting around he should have had you roll a second character who had no major roll outside combat - maybe the mechanic who fixes the wagons takes inspiration from the cleric and becomes a hammer-wielding paladin, now you have someone who sits in the background while bard runs the bar but can go on into the dungeons with the party."

I've been in a game with some friends for about five months now, and I don't think I've ever done more than two rolls in a session, and the vast majority of those have been skill rolls outside of combat. Some of the players have gotten into a few fights (mostly with each other) and have made several rolls there, but that only happens once every few sessions.

In older D&D versions (read: 2e) you had a Strength score as per normal, but rolling an 18 STR also allowed you to roll a 1d100 for exceptional strength (represented by the second number).  18/01 -> 18/00.  18/97 is just shy of having a capped strength score and would give him an increased to hit and damage adjustment"

DnDGreentext,383zk7,Domslord,7,Thu Jun 4 13:30:07 2015 UTC,"I know this is total anecdotal evidence, but I've found that someone who mains Paladin is the worst person to play games with. They are always problem players who love minmaxing and trying to be the star of the show that's supposed to have an ensemble cast. They are also, without fail, the neckbeardy ""never had a real girlfriend"" type of guy, who ends up powertripping with his holier than thou attitude the whole fucking game. But they're not a good person, they just use their god as an excuse to be a dick. I'm not saying that you're an asshole if you've ever played a Paladin, but I do admit I have a personal bias if your favorite character is a Paladin and you've played more than a couple DND games.

DnDGreentext,383zk7,Domslord,3,Tue Jun 2 19:06:48 2015 UTC,"I have had problem players in my groups (me being the PC, not the GM) in the past who keep getting invited back. Essentially telling someone ""you are no longer welcome in my game"" can be hard to do. Sometimes the GM doesn't have the spine to just cut someone out, sometimes it's that there are things they do like about the person and their flaws just come out, sometimes it's because they can't find another player, and sometimes it's just to avoid the drama (if ANYONE in the group likes them, it'll come out that there's a ""secret game"" being played without them). Luckily I usually have a good enough excuse to not invite people when I run my games (we're full, I only want to play with new players, I only want to play with experienced players) but I can understand why a shitty player gets invited back. But back to the original topic, Paladins just make shitty team players 90% of the time."
DnDGreentext,383zk7,Vandelay_Latex_Sales,6,Tue Jun 2 19:24:15 2015 UTC,"The thing is that Paladins always want to be the boss and tell people what to do because ""muh god, muh legitimacy"" and I don't like taking orders from some shithead who hasn't done anything to deserve my utter respect (remember this time when you used me as a meatshield?). I'm more of a democratic guy who like to hear everyone's idea, especially the shy guys who don't often speak up.  I also had a Dark Heresy game where a techpriest (of all people, it's some kind of tech-crazy guys who are more machines than man and don't talk much nor like it if you don't know about Warhammer40k) was acting as the leader of the group, he would never shut his mouth nor let me do my arbitrator (some super space cop, judge dredd style) job, treating me and the other guy like sidekicks.  During the first 2 session he must've had 90% of the talking time (not including the GM). I wish I were kidding, at some point I just muted my mic (was playing over the internet) and let the GM and that guy play their solo campaign while I took my dogs out. When I came back they hadn't even noticed I was out.  I mean if you just want to be the star of the show, or have some powertrip, just play a solo campaign or moderate a subreddit."
DnDGreentext,383zk7,Domslord,3,Tue Jun 2 19:42:33 2015 UTC,"I have a guy like that in a game I'm in now. He's playing a Wizard, but he's a Paladin at heart. His mission is more important than everyone else's and if you disagree he just talks louder at you until you back off. The guy is just kind of like that in most aspects of his life. I've more or less tried cutting him out of my life on multiple occasions, but about 80% of my close friends are mutual friends with him, so it's hard to tell him to fuck off without drama. But yeah, as you said, if you want to run solo, just play a video game with the cheats on."
DnDGreentext,383zk7,Vandelay_Latex_Sales,3,Tue Jun 2 20:01:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, mutual friends are a pain in the ass.  And most of the time those guys are fucking manipulators and control freaks.

After being rescued on a Federation vessel, the marooned crew wouldn't have the disruptors necessary to make it look like Klingons. Not to mention there would be a conspicuous lack of bat'leth wounds, which are par for the course in Klingon boarding actions.  They could blame it on a credible threat that uses phaser weapons, but those are few and far between, like the Ferengi. Unfortunately, Ferengi phasers are classed as plasma weapons. If boarded by a competent scanning party (highly likely), it would reveal the discharges as originating from nadion particle beams and discredit the story.  Depending on the date/location in space, their best bet is to blame Maquis raiders, who would likely have used stolen Federation equipment. If they somehow had access to some Cardassian gear, even better; could make it look like the 'raiders' were using a mix of gear stolen from Federation and Cardassian outposts.  TL;DR the Klingons did it"

DnDGreentext,384rux,electricdwarf,2,Tue Jun 2 20:42:26 2015 UTC,"Well, that's fine. I was really more talking along the lines of Runescape's Dragon Pickaxe, and more generally, ALL of the Lava Flow mine. The D Pick has a 1/5,000 chance of dropping from certain enemies in exactly one place, and of those enemies there are maybe twenty of them in total, and they are ALL essentially adrenaline fodder by the time you can get to them. You would be lucky to find a world with fewer than three people farming them. It's worth 14 million IGC, and is used to get the best pickaxe in the entire game, so it's always in high demand and low supply.  Alternately, there's the mining boosting equipment exclusive to the Lava Flow Mine. At a completely random and rare chance a gold elemental will appear and you have to speak with her to get a piece of the experience-boosting equipment.  TL;DR: Runescape has a habit of introducing stupidly rare items that do very little but have just enough added effect to be worth a stupid amount of IGC, while the stuff that CAN be farmed with skills other than combat are essentially worth pennies in comparison."

No force, or lethal force. He had three abilities. The first was to magically produce a two handed rail gun, about 6 foot in barrel length that never ran out of ammunition. Secondly he could drop a magical faraday cage over an area that would cancel all magic including his own and thirdly he was a magical leech which led to all his surroundings being a tad victorian. For instance sat in a maglev train, his carriage was made of iron and all of the seats were thick heavy red velvet and the tables solid oak. His apprentice a swordsman who always walked on the left of him was in half modern clothing which gradient into an old samurai kimono embroidered with lotus flowers. He was very steampunk large top at aviation goggles, waistcoat, big iron boats, the whole deal and on the side of his railgun was inscribed a small British flag and the phrase ""god save the queen"" he had no idea what it meant but frankly ""bloody right"". he was an avid tea drinker and boxer with a spiffy handle bar moustache of extraordinary size. In a Joker and batman esc situation many innocents were suspended above a river and a bomb planted in another hostage filled location, he could deal with one or the other, if he pursued the criminal, both sets of people died. He shot the criminal. He was never a problem again. A rumour was made that when lethal force Johnson was tasked with making sure no one burnt to death in an orphanage he shot them all to make sure they didn't suffer. This wasn't true but he let the story circulate. At one point they announced to a group of people enacting a bank heist that lethal force Johnson had arrived on the scene (he hadn't) at this point they immediately surrendered as hostages were no use against him. He was actually a persuasion based character however, when that didn't work he only had one reaction. Lethal force.  His main idol was overkill Jenkins. The last point of note was that he always bought matches from the little victorian match sellers on the street (they usually sold the newspaper but due to his time dilation effect they became young Victorian girls) which meant when ever he needed to light something even if all his belongings were gone he could reach into his pocket and find a match. A small but significant piece of magic throughout the campaign."

Expect Bordain to be posted tomorrow.  I'm more concerned with generating discussion and proving there are people who love the ASOIAF in the hopes that a new quest will come from the ashes.

DnDGreentext,379a6h,JohnnyGlat,56,Mon May 25 22:36:43 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS FOR THE FROZEN TOMB  I was playing 5e as a monk taking on The Frozen Tomb premade adventure with a ranger, a fighter, a rogue, and a cleric.  Since monks don't need armor, and their weapons are pretty cheap, I had a bunch of money available with nothing to spend it on, so I bought a bunch of seemingly useless crap: chalk, parchment, a signal whistle, a spyglass (I misread the price of it), a shovel, etc.    My character was seduced by a group of Doppelgangers (he didn't know they were Doppelgangers yet).  Considering we had just free these 4 lovely women, I thought that they may have been innocents, but just to be safe, I readied an action to use my signal whistle if something were to happen.  The party took a long rest after we had cleared all but the dungeon of the tower.  The dwarf (cleric) and the human (fighter) had to rest for all eight hours, but the high elf (rogue) and the wood elf (my monk) only needed four hours so we split up the watch.  He took first watch while I went to be thanked by the ""women"" we had saved.  Sure enough during our... ""adult wrestling,"" they all attacked me.  Thanks to monks' Unarmored Defense, only one of them managed to actually hurt me, and I immediately blew the whistle alerting the rest of the party.  I rolled a high initiative and used a ki point to activate Flurry of Blows so that I could hit all of them with Stunning Strike.  The rogue comes up the stairs to find me (naked) standing over four stunned (also naked) women.  Thanks to Stunning Strike we were able to kill all of them before they could do anything else (his Sneak Attack and my Extra Attack/Martial Arts), while the cleric and the fighter rested.  As we were calming down after the battle, the rogue nonchalantly says, ""That's the first time I've ever heard a man use a rape whistle.""  My monk face palmed, and we carried on from there.  From that point on, the signal whistle has always been referred to as the rape whistle, to my monk's eternal chagrin."

DnDGreentext,379a6h,MuffinsLovesYou,8,Tue May 26 15:21:01 2015 UTC,"Afaik, there's no coup-de-grace, but there are some similar conditions. Stunned creatures are incapacitated (can't act or react), fail Str/Dex saves, and attack rolls against them have advantage. If they had been knocked unconscious, they'd have all that, would also be prone, and any attack against them (if within 5ft) is an automatic crit."

I looked for the ones that have the sundial lens thing on them you can expend for sunbursts or something, but we'll just flavor change the Javelins to shot like energy beams?

(125k gp)  Rings:   Freedom of Movement (40k gp) Adamantine Touch (6k gp), give your melee attacks a little extra punch.   Back: War Wizard Cloak, Continuous Endure Elements, Feather Fall, Dimension Door 1/day, Mage Armor, Protection from Arrows, Sending. Replicates the suit's ability to protect Stark against the weather, safe fall, increased armor, protection from small arms fire, and comlink. (16k gp)  Throat: Amulet of Might Fists +5. Iron Man uses his fists a lot. (150k gp)  Waist: Belt of Many Pockets, for utility. (5k gp)  For the Guardian's spell storing slot, I would give it Stoneskin for extra defense, I'm not sure what would fit Iron Man's motif better.  To replicate Jarvis, we'll make the Guardian mildly intelligent. Total cost: 65600 gp.  I gave Jarvis speech, telepathy (with the amulet wielder), 120 ft. darkvision, blindsense, and hearing. Powers include knowledge in three fields of whatever, lesser globe of invulnerability 1/day, and fear against foes 3/day.  Total cost for an Iron Man-esque suit, with a pretty good amount of DM handwaving, 650,650 gold."

Basically, when the appropriate class reads a scroll without read magic, it will set the scroll off and burn the scroll. If you attempt to use a scroll that has a spell not on your spell list on it, the scroll can detonate and hurt you if you roll poorly. Given enough of a bonus, a player can bypass this with a single rank and enough gear to allow them to read any scroll and use it. That's just my thoughts"

The chances of most prostitutes being married is unlikely (granted this changes if it's not a prostitute or tavern wench).  A prostitute with a fatal or debilitating STD is unlikely to do a lot of business or even get a place in a brothel or prostitutes guild. Even one with a minor STD would be bad for business. It all seems very unlikely in a world where magical healing and alchemy are things.  Now if we're talking about a civilisation where prostitution is illegal or you describe some obviously scummy, cheap, backwoods tavern wench then that's entirely different.  I just find it strange that people feel the need to come up all of these hazards for this one profession. I think it speaks to some personal hang-ups."
DnDGreentext,366lcz,RecQuery,4,Sun May 17 18:36:31 2015 UTC,"I definitely discourage people trying to get me to roleplay fucking them.   It is just annoying 95% of the time, and the roll to win sex game isn't what I am about, so I generally make pretty harsh consequences for someone having me do so.  If someone were like trying to marry someone in my game sure fine, but most of the time when one person is trying to fuck some npc it is awkward at best for everyone else around the table.  Also 1 in 6 people in real life have herpes, so 40% of women willing to have sex that early into meeting isn't a bad representation.  And then, really think about it. Have you ever in real life came upon someone who will just fuck someone they meet randomly? And if it is at a whorehouse (which that table wasn't for) then I would probably just make it 50/50 they get some disease or they recover health."
DnDGreentext,366lcz,stGrumbles,37,Mon May 18 00:07:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that was what was happening. The way it was written (which, notably, is probably biased) made it sound like he made a character with a squire with the intent of some boots calls and was denied, so he looked for some whores and was denied again, so he went full-on questing to find out the problem.

The post clearly mentions the DM being annoyed, so she wasn't enjoying it. (unless the DM somehow isn't part of 'everyone', this already disproved your point) Edit: The post only mentions the party starting to help out because it seems fun.

DnDGreentext,35u1th,thepinksalmon,19,Wed May 13 17:44:09 2015 UTC,"You'd love the whole DCC system then! Early character gen is 100% dice rolls, everyone makes 3 characters, and whoever survives gets to pick a class after they hit level 1. You may wind up with shitty stats if you wanted a wizard and have to take a rogue instead, but it's so much fun.  Also the magic corruption mechanic is so much fun"
DnDGreentext,35u1th,Radid,7,Wed May 13 18:03:28 2015 UTC,"So from this post I can imagine that DCC is great for 1 shots, lol.  Is the system good for long term campaigns?  Or would such a campaign give level 0 characters every session to make up for the dead ones, thus making it the closest to an Only War campaign I've ever seen in fantasy?"
DnDGreentext,35u1th,ali_koneko,9,Wed May 13 18:24:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I got to run a few sessions with it, and we continued with the survivors each time. IIRC, the max level is like 10, and it's very unlikely you'll ever see that level (especially with a wizard)  The whole premise is that you're not a hero. You're an ordinary person put into extraordinary circumstances and you spend the time trying to survive/buff yourself up. When you die, you roll 3 new pieces of cannon fodder and rejoin the adventure, trying to protect at least one of them.  Our highest level character was level 5, and was a halfling.   Alternatively, you can run it as 1 shots and gen characters for each class above level 1, but the fun really kicks in with wizards at level 4+  Failing a spell roll can corrupt your wizard, physically and mentally, and can lead to hilarious roleplaying. The counterspell mechanic is pretty cool too"

DnDGreentext,35u1th,95wave,6,Wed May 13 18:30:38 2015 UTC,"Or just roll a D6, divide by two, round up.  Almost any reasonable number range can be generated with a normal set of dice without re-rolling."

Nat 1 means you hit, but then you also get a critical failure. His case was a snapped bowstring.   Also, thanks!

I chose a Wartroll, he gave me the green light, Creature Level +6. He allowed a Mage to use XP to craft his own items ""as he leveled"" and come into play with Contingency spells already in place, so I asked if I could also spend my experience ""as I leveled."" DM agrees, buy 6 negative levels (for 21k XP), now I can use 18 class levels. A cheese, but he smirked at my ""creativity"" and allowed it. 10 Monk, 8 Kensai. Use Kensai levels to enchant fists, and pay extra XP to enchant legs as well. Brilliant energy (+4), Vicious (+2) twice; end up with fists and legs that ignore armore and do 2d8+STR dmg as well as 4d6 for Vicious enchantments. Take grappling feats, improved init, combat reflexes, etc. Use money to buy books to permanently increase STR, DEX and WIS. Love charging, always did stupid things to get killed.   Tussle Bullocks was my name. Anytime anyone said Tussle, I immediately leaped on them and began wrestling with them. Got me kicked out of the few towns I was allowed in, and was usually banned for life. He ended up a 20 Monk, 12 Kensai, 4 Legendary Dreadnought who specialized in killing magic users (feats like Spellcasting Harrier, Mage Slayer, and another I can't recall).   Never was killed, but retired character to play a Psion build I had in mind. Had a friend who always made poor copies of my builds, and when I made my LE Githyanki Psion (who became a Thrallherd and eventually was retired as an NPC with my ongoing plans somewhat shaping the world) my buddy made a human Monk/Kensai to play alongside my Psion.

DnDGreentext,34mxlc,david050,4,Sun May 3 05:25:40 2015 UTC,Oh thanks. I just had a quick look at the top posts and couldnt see it
DnDGreentext,34hyl1,kalamalahala,13,Fri May 1 08:48:05 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, I remember my first DnD Session. We were playing pathfinder, a one shot, I had my character given to me. We were playing as various members of a travelling circus. I played the strong man/animal handler.   Somehow or another I got separated from the party (Dont split the party), and was attacked by two wolves. It was just me and my lion companion. I asked if I had any weapons, DM said just my body.  What do I tell him? That i Pick up the lion and swing him around. I roll a nat 20."

DnDGreentext,34hyl1,Robodingo,30,Fri May 1 16:05:59 2015 UTC,It seems as though he was perfectly taking advantage of the newfound freedom each dnd player is given to try anything they can think of...that's what makes it so entertaining!
DnDGreentext,34hyl1,HeeroToast,19,Fri May 1 18:32:20 2015 UTC,"My first game of DnD, I rolled up a generic Dwarf Cleric because the party needed a healer.  We went into a mini dungeon and the DM describes this large pile of dirt in the middle of the room.  ""I go through the pile of dirt, quietly.  I want to see what's on the other side.""  ""OK, roll a climb check to climb the pile, then a stealth check to see if they see you when you get to the top.""  ""No, no, I go through the dirt.""  ""What? Why?""  ""I dunno, I'm a fuckin' dwarf.""  I ended up popping out the other side and grappling a goblin for the following combat so we could interrogate him.  Ended up not getting any useful intel, but I thought it was awesome.  I was 22 at the time."
DnDGreentext,34hyl1,Mehknic,5,Sat May 2 04:08:57 2015 UTC,"Ha Ha, that is awesome! My players are that same age, on average, and I was wondering what compelled you to attempt an interrogation? We have been playing a module with a dungeon filled with Kobolds, and there are sidebars explaining what happens when you attempt to gather intel from them, but the players don't think twice before slashing and burning their way through everything. How can I compel them to consider such an option without just straight-up telling them?"
DnDGreentext,34hyl1,HeeroToast,3,Sat May 2 06:04:13 2015 UTC,"Well, our whole mission was ""Find out what's happening down there."" so I figured the best way to find out was to just ask.  DM didn't actually give me any info from it, but I tried."

DnDGreentext,34ebu5,Zemedelphos,78,Sat May 2 01:10:23 2015 UTC,Lawful Good  Randomly Murders people for not letting him into an inn.   That's called Chaotic Neutral.

DnDGreentext,34ebu5,stormcynk,15,Thu Apr 30 19:21:27 2015 UTC,Exactly. Lawful good is definitely not about killing random people for random things.
DnDGreentext,34ebu5,usclone,-5,Thu Apr 30 18:41:42 2015 UTC,He killed an inn full of criminals though.
DnDGreentext,34ebu5,Zemedelphos,23,Thu Apr 30 21:33:58 2015 UTC,"Wanton murder is still wanton murder, even if you found out after the fact that it was a roomfull of scum.

DnDGreentext,34ebu5,SimplyQuid,8,Thu Apr 30 22:25:07 2015 UTC,"That's vigilantism at best, hardly lawful at all"
DnDGreentext,34ebu5,Gandave,10,Thu Apr 30 23:34:52 2015 UTC,Holy rage was a mechanic that made the cleric determined to uphold the wrath of the lord. AKA I didn't have much control bar saying K lets go kill these guys.  I didn't go in and loot their shit for fun I rolled for holy wrath which set off the killing spree. AS far as I was aware I was killing people because I could sense they were evil.
DnDGreentext,34ebu5,Nerdn1,0,Fri May 1 19:45:00 2015 UTC,"Actually, that is Chaotic Evil. Chaotic, since it does most certainly not follow the law. In an average ""fantasy"" civilization they would at least deserve a trial. OP even mentioned that gambling was not against the law. Insulting someone is definitely no crime punishable by death, given that the cleric is neither a king nor a god. Evil, because he did not care for human life at all. Other options for the cleric would have included knocking people unconscious, disarming them, etc. As far I can tell he didn't even offer them a chance to surrender. Now, your GM might have plans using the insanity of your character and account for this, but in my group a cleric of a god of light (and assumedly valor, righteousness, honesty, etc.) would definitely fall for this, insane or not. However, it's your group, and if you all are having fun, then by all means do ignore my comment. :)"
DnDGreentext,34ebu5,stormcynk,0,Sun May 3 17:03:17 2015 UTC,"It could be Lawful Neutral or Lawful Evil (LG is a REALLY hard sell), depending on how strict your code is, but only if you slaughter EVERY den of sin and corruption you find, in accordance to the HOLY LAW.  If you inconsistent at all (or follow a system of laws that doesn't specifically sanction such punishment), then that level of disproportionate response can't be Lawful."
DnDGreentext,34ebu5,stormcynk,12,Mon Jul 13 21:46:54 2015 UTC,"Well he kicks down the door and kills the guy behind the door before even realizing they were bad. And I wasn't in the campaign, so I don't know if gambling is illegal. If all the betting was solid then nothing illegal/immoral was going on, unless they were playing with cards made out of human skin or betting childs eyes."
DnDGreentext,34ebu5,drretardo,3,Thu Apr 30 21:40:30 2015 UTC,when they said piss off he took it as an insult because they didn't want lordy types so to speak and threw his weight around.... namely the door.  Not that it's illegal just he sees it as illegal and immoral.
DnDGreentext,34ebu5,Arathnorn,5,Fri May 1 19:47:09 2015 UTC,"What in a lawful good person's code or set of laws says that not liking lordy types is punishable by death?? It's fine that it happened in game, but that doesn't fit with a lawful good character! If a ""lawful good"" character did that in a campaign I DMed they'd be falling and have to do atonement at the very least before they could become lawful good again."

DnDGreentext,34024d,dungeon_plastered,38,Mon Apr 27 05:46:45 2015 UTC,This is why playing drunk can either be the best or the worst thing to do with your group.
DnDGreentext,34024d,hillerj,15,Mon Apr 27 08:42:56 2015 UTC,Drunken one-shots almost exclusively run towards the best. Campaigns with drunk nights can get comically dangerous though
DnDGreentext,34024d,methuzia,20,Mon Apr 27 14:39:21 2015 UTC,"This is why I thought it'd always be a good idea to do drunk campaign sessions canonically fucked up.  For example; the party is exposed to some kind of innocuous seeming magical hallucinogen by the 3rd drink. Anything that happens while they're fucked up isn't 100% the truth, but their decisions during it can result in real-world reprecussions, and the acquisition of things that would make more sense if they just stayed in hallucinationland.  Think of it as like, a semidream; it's not exactly 1:1 canon, what goes on there, but it's not erased at the end."
DnDGreentext,34024d,Zemedelphos,4,Mon Apr 27 16:45:20 2015 UTC,That's genius! I've never thought about that before. It's like the boss fight scenes in Far Cry 3.

Our DM increased its size because it was really cool that way(I dunno), and had it being used by a country of dwarves as a gigantic mortar/weapon of mass destruction. We ended up going into full scale war with the dwarves, and had a dragon distract the tarrasque until we won the battle. Then(and our DM only planned that we would send it back to the dwarf land) it started trying to run away. Our party was having none of that so we climbed up it, and sat there for a bit with no idea what to do. And then I realized I had a book with ""Greater Interplanetary Teleport"" in it."

DnDGreentext,33vasu,gaylordqueen69,3,Sun Apr 26 01:45:10 2015 UTC,"Yep. Which is why one time a wizard I was playing became the terrasque. Good times were had.   By me. Most everybody else was trying to wipe the liquid fear off of their legs after seeing the terrasque flying over town.  Buying equipment was a lot harder after that though, modifying equipment cost for size sucks."
DnDGreentext,33vasu,Deefry,9,Sun Apr 26 10:52:17 2015 UTC,I can only dream of what wonders this story holds. But alas ...
DnDGreentext,33vasu,Deefry,23,Sun Apr 26 09:18:39 2015 UTC,"Fuck it, I'm waiting for a game to load.  Most awesome thing I've done recently (in a thread re-railing attempt)?  Well, I played an elderly wizard in a high-level game recently. His ""character idea""? He was a spellcaster undergoing a midlife crisis and he was ronery and alone fom a lifetime of studying musty old tomes.  So he ended up buying a COLOSSAL airship (One hundred tons), hiring himself a crew, making said crew neigh-invulnerable with some bullshit spells (Hide Life in particular), and then becoming the scourge of the land, sky, and sea.  By the middle of the campaign, he had made himself a mobile fortress, and vowed to hunt down Tarrasque so that ""Nobody would ever forget me again!""  He ended up getting just what he wished for in a way even HE didn't expect: Whilst he was aiding the PCs in building themselves an uberfortress (Combination of an artifact that allowed Epic Teleport at-will and a massive army of imps he summoned and permanently bound for them), they went on a standard raid on some distant fortress.  After some standard monster hunting, we end up running into a Lich. A high-level Lich. Somehow, through an epic roll, the party barbarian intimidates a fucking LICH into becoming a sniveling coward. Lich declares that though they may kill him, his patron is a much worse being to deal with.  Midlife Crisis Wizard asks who the fuck his patron was, expecting some archdemon or devil or something.  Fucking Tarrasque. Turns out that Smartass McWizard here fucking AWAKENED TARRASQUE. On top of that, after a few more threats and some firm knocks on his phylarcy, he admits that he did more than make THE most dangerous creature in the univers sentient.  He trained him in wizardly spells. Well, FUCK, turns out Tarrasque is now packing levels in fucking WIZARD. I'm fucking applying my palm directly to my forehead at this point.  More below."
DnDGreentext,33vasu,Deefry,15,Sun Apr 26 10:16:18 2015 UTC,"5737801    Now, we continue adventuring, and I make my airship more kickass  as the rest of the party works on our uberfortress. We add some kickass Tesla-style cannons to the battlements, get a freaking moat of pure lava straight from the Plane of Fire (With Elder Fire Elementals we buffed up inhabiting the moat), and somehow manage to get enough people in our fortress that it becomes a sort of United Nations meeting spot for people to peacefully discuss things.  This place has the WORKS. Ghosts bound to patrol against ethereal invaders, specially-made golems monitoring a series of scrying windows (effectively a security camera system), and a cadre of about thirty-odd spellcasters of 8th to 12th level constantly toiling away to help reinforce and add onto what is currently being built. Magic weapons are commonplace in the armory, and the guards are all elite soldiers drilled to fight everything ranging from savage goblins to horrific illithids (All of which we captured specimens of, or simply teleported into our bestiary).  Things are looking pretty fucking sweet, but we know what's going to happen. Tarrasque the Wizard is still out there, and fuck if we know what he's got planned. Whilst we have comprehensive defenses, we can't monitor everywhere at once. He could very well be in his own little demiplane, conjuring legion after legion of monsters, or crafting enough golems to swarm us. But we continue to prepare, even going so far as to import three or four dragons (at extravagant expense, but what do we care) to reside as a permanent supplement to my airship patrols. Dragons, after all, are much more agile than my 100 ton ""Kick Your Ass' ship.  Then it happens."
DnDGreentext,33vasu,Deefry,14,Sun Apr 26 10:21:06 2015 UTC,"5737908    Yep. Tarrasque appears. And even worse, he's called in a FUCKTON of soldiers to aid him in what can only be described as, ""Bowser gets smart, decides to use all his troops to take over the kingdom rather than nab a single princess"". His lich ""follower"" is pretty much left to rot as Tarrasque the Wizard ends up unleashing some heavy duty magic on our asses.  Now, we expected a fair number of troops on his side, but we forgot something important: Tarrasque was fucking Tarrasque, and if you add magic into the mix, you're just /inviting/ trouble. He had apparently made some friends in the Abyss (the very same people we tended to piss off in our numerous adventures), and- as we were to later discover- he had indeed used the Genesis spell to create his own demiplane.  One where he had created a continuous Time Stop-esque effect, slowing the passage of time outside enough to allowing him to amass enough golems and monsters to actually stand a good chance against us. And by ""good chance"" I mean he had something on par with the giant army from the LOTR movies.  And we didn't have a Gandalf to save our asses. Fuck."
DnDGreentext,33vasu,Deefry,13,Sun Apr 26 10:24:34 2015 UTC,"It was at this point that we're shitting a gothic cathedral, staring at the troop numbers of what he had prepared (Effectively having enlisted most of the Archfiends and a good number of horrifically evil demons to monster mash it up). Hell, he even had an entire PLATOON of Adamantium Golems that just shrugged off direct hits from the Blast Disk field we had set up around our castle perimeter. He was just holding back at the rear of the army, hi-fiving the other archfiends as the rest of this horrible army began to charge at our front wall.  Up above, the airship I had spent all campaign preparing was finally put to good use. Thunderstone-tipped bombs knocked holes in the advancing horde, arcane rockets (Effectively maximized fireball spells) sailing into the mass of golems, demons, mercenaries, and other creatures below. More than a few Vrocks attempted to attack the airship, but a few well-placed Mass Earthbound spells made sure the worst of them were pinned below and the rest left at the mercy of repeating crossbows.  The battle raged in front of the giant lava moat, the Adamantium Golems making a solid battering ram of fists as they began to bore through the walls, monsters following behind them as- up above- permanent Walls of Force protected the troops from demonic siege munitions. Mostly.  It was at this point that we whipped out everything we had: Ranging from artifact weapons that could make a man's flesh into solid adamantium to a fully-functioning Repeating Cannon of Magic Missile (Basically a magical gatling gun).  Blood ran so thick, the magic so suffused with magic, that blood golems actually formed in the middle of the melee and attacked both sides. We knew that it was only about to get worse: Tarrasque was beginning to move towards the fray, having torn off one of the defensive towers and used it as a makeshift baseball bat, which he intended to use as a mallet on one of our party members currently holding off a pair of Pit Fiends in a duel."
DnDGreentext,33vasu,Deefry,14,Sun Apr 26 10:30:22 2015 UTC,"And that's when the S.S. Kick Your Ass came to the rescue. Having poured all of MY money into the airship, it was naturally the most abdass thing to ever sail the skies. A solid diamond hull, over thirty omnidirectional fireball turrets to hit any one target, and each crewman had been specially enchanted with Hide Life (Which basically made them a living lich, which could continue to function beyond -10 HP. Never age, never die, just keep getting injured and chugging on).  But that wasn't the REAL masterpiece here. It was the anchors, which I had built with Tarrasque specifically in mind. Why? Because each anchor weighed somewhere on par with twenty thousand pounds, held specially suspended by a Reverse Gravity spell carefully regulated.  And was solid adamantium.  With a cry of, ""Drop anchor!"" the airchip swooped in on Tarrasque, four ten-ton enchors made from solid adamantium crashing into his insanely massive bulk. Even with all of his contingency spells, they barely made a dent on the chains as they impaled the beast.  ""Full steam ahead!""  The engines, a clever recreation of antimatter by mixing negative and positive energy, reached full blast.  150MPH in a single round. 1800ft per round.  We were pulling four gees in under six seconds, Tarrasque dragged along for the ride."
DnDGreentext,33vasu,Deefry,12,Sun Apr 26 10:34:17 2015 UTC,"5738110    *The air suffused with magic. Hurried fingers do the devil's work...    5738174    Moving a near-escape-velocity, this one-hundred-ton behemoth began to ferry the sentient Tarrasque away from the battle, the gigantic chains- intended to stop the massive vessel dead in its tracks- beginning to bend and warp under a constant barrage of Disintegrate and Lightning Bolt spells (All, of course, Maximized and Quickened). Several crewmen were vaporized as the shocks traveled up the chains, but still the airship plowed on, sending the gigantic beast tumbling through defensive wall after defensive wall, crushing countless thousands of its own troops as it thrashed for a grip.  It found one.  Grabbing onto one of the walls, it held onto the chains hooking it with a feral smile on its face. Yanking firmly, the entire airship suddenly halted. It had the two things it needed now: The support of the wall and the unbreakable lever of the chains. Watching with horror, my wizard felt a sudden tearing motion as Tarrasque began to pull the airship closer. In my foolishness, I had made sure the chains were completely anchored to the very core of the airship so as to prevent Tarrasque from breaking away to early.  Yet now it was beginning to haul me closer, its giant claws bringing my countless feet towards the ground with each mighty tug. I was not going to get out of this, I knew. Even as I had the engine at full burst, the giant monster still had an insane amount of strength to counteract the engines, the hordes at its feet crawling up its body and onto the giant metal links of the chain, heedless of risk as they attempted to try and reach the airship held captive."
DnDGreentext,33vasu,Deefry,16,Sun Apr 26 10:39:23 2015 UTC,"5738263    It was at this point that the party sprung into action. Calling in a few favors from our celestial contacts, the party Cleric did what could only be considered the impossible.  He tore open a hole straight to Heaven. And down they came, with an immaculate chorus, celestial beings of every make and type. Ranging from Devas that clove Vrocks apart midair, to even the puniest Lantern Archon that seared rank upon rank of Imp with holy light. The party Barbarian, mentioned earlier, entered his greatest Frenzy yet, inspiring an entire platoon of our heavy infantry to charge heedlessly into the enemy ranks, taking wounds that would fell a mortal man without even blinking.  We were gods of battle, and heaven and hell waged their war around our knees. Tarrasque gave a mighty heave as the airship almost came within striking range of those deadly claws, but it soon became apparent what his intent was."
DnDGreentext,33vasu,Deefry,11,Sun Apr 26 10:42:41 2015 UTC,"5738359    Grabbing the solid mithral tower he had clutched earlier, Tarrasque released his grasp of the wall, ramming a stake through the heart of our vessel. A hole rent straight through the diamond armor, taking out several of the munitions bays in the process. Secondary explosions began to gut the vessel as our celestial reinforcements began to falter, the Archfiends entering the fray with tarrasque at this point. Demonic lashes took out score after score of the divine beings, leaving only undead and fatal amounts of negative energy in their wake. The raw amounts of death these beings radiated were enough to kill mortals and reanimate the dead.  Despite our Cleric's glorious efforts, the battle seemed sure to be won by Tarrasque and his forces. My airship was dying, deck after deck going up in flames as the fire suppression system (A sentient water elemental that constantly funneled the ship's water tanks to the necessary areas) was overwhelmed.  This was it. The end of our fortress, our preparation incapable of holding off the tides of Tarrasque, the Slayer of Adventurers, Archmage of the highest power."
DnDGreentext,33vasu,tsoccer93,14,Sun Apr 26 10:46:06 2015 UTC,"5738350  5738166    And then my mamma got scared and said ""You're going to your auntie and uncle in bel-air"".  HA HA! Just fuckin' with you, continuing.    5738365    It was at this point, watching as his pride and joy was slowly destroyed by a mirth-riddled Tarrasque, that he finally said, ""Enough of this bullshit.""  With a fearsome bellow, he grabbed ahold of the helm of his vessel, struggling at the controls as flames continued to rip through the countless decks. Crewmen continued to work even as their flesh boiled, their loyalty to ""The Cap'n"" driving them to labor through the pain. At his direction, the airship's ""force fields"" (Enchanted keyholes throughout the vessel, each one linked to a Wall of Force in that section of the ship) were all activated except along one route, every munitions not yet destroyed by the flames armed and rolled out into that central path.  My wizard knew what had to be done. Grinning below, he kicked the control wheel forward, the entire airship beginning to dip forward, the metal chains ripping the hull further as Tarrasque was given a direct view of the airship's bridge.  Opening its maw wide, it complemented the wizard on his willingness to stare death in the eyes, even as hordes of monsters began to infest the ship. Drawing his hands together, the wizard prepared one final spell, the battle-ender he had been saving for this entire time.  His last command echoed throughout the vessel, his crewmen each obeying with stern faces and firm resolve. Even as abomination after abomination tore into them, rending them limb from limb, they awaited that order. The order to bring them into everlasting glory."

As for if it had actually been acted out in the game, that is certainly concerning. Just because ""it's not real life"" doesn't mean there aren't consequences to actions. If it's just being done for a laugh, that suggests a lack of respect for the situation, and should be pointed out. If it's done to fulfill some fantasy, that indicates some other issues that I personally wouldn't be comfortable remaining around, but sure, I suppose it just being in a game is better than an actual date rape. It's still not something to just ignore, though.  I also never said anything about never referencing sex crimes ever again, and I never said what happened was horrible, just in bad taste. There are certainly ways to portray sex crime in fiction, but to use as a tool as you suggest to manipulate how you feel about the characters is poor form. Be sure to give it the context and magnitude it deserves  I have no idea what you mean by ""reality denial"", but since there are no rape victims at  the focus of this conversation, I have no idea what the fuck it has to do with anything.  Lastly, perhaps you should double check the meaning of fallacy since having a personal reaction to a story is never in the author's control, and blaming someone for feeling a certain way is illogical itself. Not to mention that you're using a lot of hyperbole and extremes that were never part of my comments. That, in fact, is fallacious."
DnDGreentext,32ur3i,Yojimara,6,Fri Apr 17 21:00:38 2015 UTC,"Humor is a perfectly valid way to deal with serious topics.  There is nothing wrong with acting out, writing about, or thinking about theft, rape, murder, or any other kind of crime, because there is a difference between fantasy and reality. Nabokov is not a pedophile because he wrote Lolita. Anthony Hopkins is not a murderous lunatic because he wanted to play the role of Hannibal Lecter. Not even a little bit. To claim that even in imagined situations there are still these nebulous 'consequences to actions' you refer to does nothing but spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt based on no evidence whatsoever but your personal politics.  Please stop moralizing in this thread."
DnDGreentext,32ur3i,Easilycrazyhat,-3,Fri Apr 17 21:18:54 2015 UTC,"Humor is a perfectly valid way to deal with serious topics.   Depends on the situation.   There is nothing wrong with acting out, writing about, or thinking about theft, rape, murder, or any other kind of crime   Again, depends on the situation.    does nothing but spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt   If by that you mean ""makes people think"", sure. Not such a bad ""consequence"" if you ask me.   Please stop moralizing in this thread.   I'm not. I'm explaining myself to people putting words in my mouth. If by ""moralizing"" you mean having a discussion and explaining my position, I guess I am. Yet all I said in my first comment was that, just maybe, referencing a horrible act that really has nothing to do with the situation at hand was possibly not the best choice. Other people began to bring up morality. Sorry I bummed you out by having a conversation around you."

DnDGreentext,329yh2,BrooksConrad,40,Sun Apr 12 15:36:24 2015 UTC,"That is the greatest idea for a BBEG.   For decades, the stories of the evil wizard have circulated the kingdom. He was remembered as cruel, cunning, and a master of his art. He had not been seen in many years, so he had became more a legend of a boogyman than the tyrant he was. We were resolved to conquer his keep and collect his fortune. If not, we could end the constant fear of his return. His fortress wasn't nearly as guarded as all had said. It was far too easy. We stayed cautious, though. Most of the traps had already been sprung, much to the rogue's delight, and dismay. Among the traps, we saw many corpses that had made the journey and never returned. It didn't take nearly as long to reach the innermost chambers as we thought it should. Inside was nothing but sadness. All around swarmed animated objects. Basic tools, weapons, even riches of jewels and coins scurried about. As we entered the wizard's throneroom, the truth became clear. For many long years he waited here for adventurers to challenge him, but few had made it this far.  The ravages of time had made this once powerful wizard into a decrepit, senile old man. Our wizard made conversation and shared with him some of our provisions. He seemed glad for the company and fresh food and drink. He told us his story. So long ago, at his most powerful, he built this keep to protect himself during his research into forgotten magics. As the years passed, the loneliness set in. He began animating his tools to work the caverns and reinforce his defenses. Soon after, he began animating his treasures. They never gave him the comfort or companionship he desired. His research dwindled and senility set in. Until we arrived. As he passed his final breath, he instructed us to take what we could, for this will all cave in shortly after his death. As he faded, so did his animations. All was still within his home, his keep, and his tomb."

DnDGreentext,31wxaq,AnonymousPepper,7,Thu Apr 9 15:13:13 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of a WIS7/INT7 Paladin in my 3.P plane-hopping game that I run.  Story time:  Until recently, Avenal (the Paladin) worshiped Asmodeus (as a LG pally! FROM A NOBLE FAMILY OF CHELIAX!) because he was literally too dense to realize that Asmodeus was evil; for the Big A's part, he allowed it purely because he thought it was fucking hilarious, to the extent of going to the trouble sending a fiendish unicorn in response to a planar ally request once. This guy was so dumb, there was a time when the party's Artificer learned some critical and sensitive information and was afraid Avenal would tell the wrong person, so to make sure he didn't hear it, he just randomly pulled a copper coin out of his pocket, chucked it, bluffed the Pally into believing he'd dropped it, and sent him off to grab it while he (the Artificer) clued in the rest of the party.  Of course, having a massive CHA score along with the low WIS/INT, and being this epic heroic figure, he's gotten hit on by like 50% of the female NPCs he's encountered. He's just beyond oblivious to it. There was an embassy secretary that tried to openly hit on him after he went out of his way to make her job easier and he... well, take my word for it, the stupidity and sheer obliviousness was glorious. The party's Artificer has a nefarious plot to gain influence in Cheliax by marrying him off to someone super important, but the biggest obstacle for him is just how dumb this guy is.  NPCs have looked at the man with raised eyebrows the entire game - once, an imposter cab driver trying to lead the group into an ambush used it as an excuse to cover up what he was doing by arguing with Avenal (in front of the poor group) about Asmodeus for like 20 minutes straight. Eventually (a couple sessions ago) a well-meaning NPC Inquisitor of Sarenrae he'd just fought alongside noted Avenal's goodness and the blingy holy symbol of Asmodeus and got into a theological discussion with him; the Paladin lost his roll-off against the Inquisitor (iirc, I had him roll diplo+knowledge religion?) and had a crisis of faith.   He's still dumb as hell; he just worships Paladine now."

I just caught up and can't wait to see how Sarge and crew try to tackle their next ""escort and capture"" mission.  I know little to nothing about the Warhammer 40k universe, but the writing style combined with the Wiki makes the story so accessible.  Thanks!  Edit: Just read that you were happy to answer questions.  How many players do you DM for, and who do they play as?   When one player becomes incapacitated for X amount of time ingame, do you just bring in a temporary secondary for them to play as?  I haven't played any tabletop/role playing games, but do each of the characters have skill levels/points/stats that their rolls are based off of?  I assume Sarge has some +Leadership and Twitch has +Demolitions, but you do such a good job of portraying the characters as having a reason for why they are good/bad at certain things that everything just flows so naturally within the party dynamic.  Thanks again."
DnDGreentext,31rsrw,Skellum,3,Sun Apr 19 15:33:11 2015 UTC,"Five, and they play the guardsmen as well as occasionally directing the npcs for me. Yes, the one time it wasn't a whole-session they just took over a NPC in the group, the other two times whole new guardsmen were brought in. Whether they become permanent replacements or even stick around as NPCs after their original character recovers is up to the players. You have it right, but this party is slightly odd in that everyone is playing the same base class, so there's less overt distinction between characters than usual. That's why they play up the minor differences so much. Usually the defining character trait in each guardsman is based around their only real mechanical difference from the other guardsmen.   Anyway, I'm glad you enjoy these stories and I'll pass your praise on to the author. Shoggy tends to worry that no-one outside the 40k/RPG community would really enjoy these."

It holds technology back and at the same time is the only thing lighting the world in thousands of places like mini Astronomicons. The pure amount of fuck that goes into non-STC and sometimes even STC tech is incredible and the thought of breaking something by non-ritualistic use is so horrible it explains why they turn everything into servitors.

Or, change from ""passive"" Neutral to ""active"" Neutral:   Most neutral characters exhibit a lack of conviction or bias rather than a commitment to neutrality... Still, she’s not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way.  Some neutral characters, on the other hand, commit themselves philosophically to neutrality. They see good, evil, law, and chaos as prejudices and dangerous extremes. They advocate the middle way of neutrality as the best, most balanced road in the long run.    Either way there should still be an effect for the neutral character."
DnDGreentext,313p9m,Galemp,14,Wed Apr 1 23:32:35 2015 UTC,"The DM ruled that normally there isn't even an opposite spawned in that world for neutral characters. However, since it was the work of magic in what I assume is something like a pocket dimension, it was forced and the entire point of it is becoming the exact opposite. In this case, active neutrality would be the only thing that would make sense. Maybe I'll implement it into my characters role play style, who knows? Thanks for the advice!"

All they know is that the people go into the mirrors and fight someone who looks like them.  Sometimes they come back out and sometimes they don't (when the fighters kill each other, which in a ""mirror match"" would presumably be fairly often).  It never occurs to them that sometimes the person who comes out of the mirror isn't the person who went in.  After all, it isn't like the evil twin is going to admit to being an evil twin."
DnDGreentext,313p9m,beetnemesis,7,Thu Apr 2 05:21:37 2015 UTC,"Well, it's many many layers of magic, and basically the test is just a portal to a parallel world where your exact opposite is willed into existence and given the soul task to kill you. But in being slain, your soul is immediately transferred through some magic or the other. Winning has no effect. Emerging from that world is what gives you citizenship, regardless of alignment."

The land they're running around in is loosely  based off of the Shattered Plains of the Stormlight Chronicles, but that was just a start. Now there's all sorts of high tech fantasy nonsense going around. N'Gar has a ring on her tail with the word ""AUTHORITY"" engraved on it in reverse so she can slap someone across the face with it and have it ""branded"" into their skin. The cleric's holy symbol is a flask of absinthe. N'Gar also has a pair of Gauntlets of Ogre Power that, as an encounter power, can make one opponent piss themselves. We've settled into a comfortable dynamic; I play my side of the table completely straight laced, while they get down in any way they want so long as all the numbers line up on my side of the screen. They're not evil, they're just deeply self obsessed.  Through all of this, I have never forgotten rule number one; let the players have fun. My dad once told me, ""Don't try to teach a pig to sing. It'll make you look stupid and it will annoy the pig."" I've taken that to heart with this campaign. Putting my ego aside as a DM has been deeply rewarding."

Player just dropped that on the GM in the middle of the game. Didn't even have the gnome statted up, which is by far the most important part of this concept. Besides, who says there are robots in this world? And doesn't this unbalance the party dynamic? It's the same as adding an entirely new PC and letting one player control it in addition to whatever he's already got.  I'd be likely to allow this kind of thing in my games, but I'd need time to weigh the fun factor against the abuse factor. If it breaks the game, it's out. If it's impossible in the setting, it's out. If there's a good chance it'll cause inter-player conflict, it's out.  If someone said, ""A gnome pops out of my character who's actually a robot and attacks the BBEG,"" without discussing it with me beforehand, I'd say, ""No it doesn't.""

I don't know how he got 19, but the monster's manual has the number appearing of 20-200, so maybe he was taking some sort of average? Or he might have had some sort of long term campaign idea of a gnoll/hobgoblin/Orc uprising? I'm not sure, but I'll ask in the morning.  If you really want to plan a campaign like him, make some backup characters to choose from for when your players die and be brutally realistic about how bad things move around in the area (campaign is fighting goblins? Have there be a chance to accidentally run into like a battalion of 200 of them while traveling).

Party will leave with a muscular NPC warrior and his bard buddy.  The twist is once they arrive at the castle I'll have them all do will rolls from time to time for an unspecified purpose. Anyone who passes will start getting notes while I continue to talk to the rest of the players. Castle is actually an illusion and the old man was mind controlled, in reality it's a small ithilid town using the story of a kidnapped girl to lure in slaves."

The party was pissed.   first time DMing party enters the dwelling of a family of vampires whole family turned to spirits by an evil curse parts of the giant house locked away by magic only way to progress is by getting magic keys from the ghosts only way to save family is by defeating their ghosts and using a spell given by the goblin wizard who gave them the quest to turn the spirits into statues BBEG is a pissed off necromancer who was killed by the family's head of house (the father) and came back as a ghost to enact revenge once all of the dead vampires are turned into statues the players go for a final battle on the roof the BBEG is a big white fat guy who's claimed to be the king of the spirits the party is walking away after the fight and they see a guy with a green hat ask them if they've seen the goblin wizard   The layout of the mansion was identical to that of the game. I included all of the same characters and puzzles with slightly different names. It was a crazy time.

DnDGreentext,2ziaxn,ilikewc3,74,Wed Mar 18 22:08:58 2015 UTC,"GM here. Yes, 3 nat 20s in a row. Do you understand how much I hate this piece of shit? I hate him. He's my best friend. But I hate him. I spend five hours crafting a re-write of a single quest from the adventure path the party is using, including generating quick sheets for stronger foes, improving the story, and adding/improving flavor text. I show up to the game with a 12-page packet, confident that I've accommodated for any possible dickfuckery.  And this guy. This motherFUCKER starts derailing it from page one which is just STORY AND FLAVOR TEXT. So by the time we even get to this scaly ranger I am done with his shit, I'm like ""Yeah okay I'll let him roll whatever"". And he rolls nat 20. So I start getting nervous. I think ""Don't panic, the foe is chaotic evil. He can't get himself out of this one.""  Another nat 20. So now I just don't know what the hell to do. I try to think of a way to rationalize what he's doing within the confines of the story. I tell him to roll for bluff and assume he'll fail.  NOPE this fuckface goes ahead and shits on my plans completely by rolling a nat 20 on bluff. Not only that, but while rationalizing I realize that the foe in question not being susceptible to bluff wouldn't make sense since the players KILLED THE CULTIST SHE WORKED UNDER BEFORE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO.  So, giving up on maintaining any semblance of my original plan now that we're at the end, I let the ranger convince the enemy ranger not to fight us, and to trade him her monitor lizard companion in exchange for learning basic trapmaking (which is useless to her because she's a mongrelman traitor. But what the fuck ever, three nat 20s).  So now I've got to get a quest ready for next session and I'm trying to figure out how even. Microwave his dice? Reduce his level? Kill his ranger for a session? God knows I'm less creative than he is, and being friends with him has taught me that he'll always outsmart me, but I'm hoping he's like a cat and I can at least outwit him.  And Eric: Fuck you, your glorious disregard for the reality you're presented with is forcing me to put effort into GMing."

DnDGreentext,2z709o,Morbidman,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:57:59 2015 UTC,"6 months spent in a swamp that stays relatively swampy and warm will actually degrade wood extremely fast unless its a wood that is adapted for survival or use there (think salt treated). It could be either one, but i still favor the story with crutches."
DnDGreentext,2z709o,critfist,3,Mon Mar 16 21:08:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking that would make sense too. Still not sure about how that would translate to hallucinating him laying them down and picking them up again, but maybe it's not supposed to perfectly translate either way?"

DnDGreentext,2z709o,OddtheWise,2,Wed Mar 18 05:13:05 2015 UTC,"They are actually good points. I'd guess they just didn't say it out right that they took it and that it permanently changes the brain. but now i have to think about it.   The author said that that this time the did not get it, i took it as a hint as to why this time they did not see the zombies, etc. thats just my interpretation. they possibly took a hit to test it out what it did how strong it was etc. The lack of the powder was also the main difference between the beginning of the  campaigns but correlation does not necessarily mean causation. It would explain why several people had the same hallucinations too."
DnDGreentext,2z709o,KWiP1123,3,Wed Mar 18 10:31:13 2015 UTC,"Actually if I was to murder a whole town while under the influence of, say, LSD I would likely lose my mind completely because at some level I would know what had happened and when I came to I would snap. Also people tripping have a tendency to share hallucinations."
DnDGreentext,2z709o,Davis660,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:38:11 2015 UTC,Perhaps the high was when they saw the village the first time. Then the crash caused them to see some bad shit. That or maybe they took some more and had a bad trip

Came back to the city destroyed and only a fraction of the box surviving in the rubble. Box paladin kept it on his person for a time only for an elf kid to pickpocket it in the next town.  GM says this is not the end of the Paladin Box. We'll return to the pickpocket's city a couple sessions from now and will likely see its conclusion. As of now, however, the box's final fate remains a mystery.  I might write a sequel story when I know for sure."
DnDGreentext,2z5m50,TimothyVH,3,Tue Apr 14 22:03:42 2015 UTC,UPDATE: Paladin left the group before we could return to the pickpocket's city and the GM disappeared shortly after. We will never know what the deal with that box was. :c

DnDGreentext,2ymxxb,GandalfTheUltraViole,7,Wed Mar 11 04:31:05 2015 UTC,youre a much better storyteller. but make me sound good
DnDGreentext,2ymxxb,theodorusrex,16,Wed Mar 11 04:48:17 2015 UTC,"So in my current campaign the party just left the small town they were based in, and one of the last things they did there was to rescue the daughter of the lumbermaster because they needed hm on their side. She turned out to be in a dungeon, go figure, in a game called dungeons and dragons.  I took the idea for the dungeon from an /r/DnD thread where DMs were challenged to pitch a dungeon idea in three words. One dude came up with ""animated object everything"". Fun story, same dude also came up with ""Tarrasque Meth Lab"" but I haven't run that one yet.  Anyway, the idea is that this is the apartment of a hermit wizard type, and the first few rooms have nothing but animated objects in them, with a series of commands. In the antechamber it's ""Kill anything that enters suddenly and isn't me"" and they got more complicated from there on. But that's not important.  See, most of these objects weren't enchanted properly. He skimped on the spells, and they ended up with the HP of objects a size class below what they should have. It meant they could still hit pretty hard, but it brought the CR down to something the party could deal with. But there was one piece of furniture he'd spent a lot of time on, what was essentially his last line of defense... y'know, before the hidden door, the puzzle, the trap, and himself. The rogue was standing on the trap when it went off, I had a quiet giggle about that. But anyways, this throne was done right, and it had 52 HP. As I recall, the party was level 3 at the time.  So the fighter, played by this dude above me, peeks into this room, sees a ton of objects and a luxurious throne. And he thinks, ""I'll have that"" and charges it. It's only just barely within his charge range, but he makes it. A few chairs get some attacks of opportunity as he goes past, but nothing serious. He gets to the throne. He raises his hammer. He pauses to roll the dice...  He crits. His hammer was his only starting gear because it was full-on epic. 3d6+6 18-19(x3). And the motherfucker got a crit.  22 damage. 19 damage. 21 damage. And that adds up to 62. He one-hit-killed the only boss in the entire fucking dungeon, after already fighting through three rooms of this.  He went on to mop the whole place up of course. It's what happens when you're the only melee PC in a dungeon full of things that won't listen to reason."

DnDGreentext,2ye1q8,Hephoran,55,Mon Mar 9 00:25:14 2015 UTC,"[Text is as close to original as possible, including most spelling mistakes.]       Be playing Dark Heresy  Party consists of an Arbitrator as team leader a tech-priest as tech support, a Stormtrooper for bolters and backup CQC, a death cult assassin for CQC, and finally, my Guardsman filing up the role of Demolitions  We are tasked with infiltrating a slaving ring, finding its base then setting off a transponder before waiting for further details.  Roles / disguises break down as always (read above)  Anyways, we infiltrate the ring by kidnapping fools, eventually arriving at the enemy asteroid base  ""Asteroid"" doesn't do this thing justice, it was the size of a small moon that had been hollowed out and filled with dockyards, habs, hydroponics, power and of course, Signal Jammers.  Our way around this was to get VERY close to a few individuals and essentially piggyback the base's comms to get a signal out.  As we get up and up by doing ops against Arbites and pirates, we start getting fancier and fancier stuff.  Eventually, we get called into a meeting with the base's boss. And we meet him in his office.  The office is huge, and the walls and ceilings are giant screens showing the asteroid field like giant windows. The centre of the room had a large table with three people sitting behind it.  The one of the left is a fat man, in a suit with a monocle like a cross between a munitorum serf and the Penguin from Batman. He stank of sweat barely covered up by perfumes. He displayed no weapons.  The one in the middle, the obvious leader, looked like an Imperial Guard general crossed with Vladimir Putin. He wore a black trench coat over carapice armour with a pistol strapped over his waist. His right arm was bionic and his left arm wore a power fist.   [image 2]  The one on the right is the one who My character had problems with. The best way to describe her is Revy from black lagoon with Cat ears along with Balalika's attitude and back story. She was the only one standing and wore an ornate red dress and wore her hair in a pony tail. Strapped to her legs were a pair of cut-down hellpistols.   The trio introduced themselves from left to right. Theodore VonAdolf, Maxwell Camaroon and Janice Petrov. They were the joint commanders to the outlaw base of ""Free-point""  The party handed the meeting the only way they knew how. By standing to attention and praying that no one checked their pockets.  During the meeting everyone sized each other up, checking for weakness. The GM described that ""Madame Petrov's eyes cross over all of you, lingering for an uncomfortably long tim on Foulk before continuing""  Instantly start worrying internally about this little thing.  We get back to doing our thing, but with more of my character being sent out, thinking he is being followed by glimpsing ""a familiar dress"" before pulling the stealthy equivalent of a Crazy Ivan, waiting for a few turns before sneaking back on his way.   Eventually find out just who's been stalking our resident S.T.A.L.K.E.R. No-one is really surprised when it turns out that Janice is stalking him.  This starts out as just curious glances around corners and massive blushing that registers on our sensors.  It gets to the point where the party is split, with my guy going off and doing things while the rest do the Inquisitorial stuff.  Occasionally we have to leave for long ops, we aren't followed.  Then we start noticing people following us.  This escalates from ""stalking"" to ""Mystery packages for my character"" and ending up at ""Walking into an ambush where the ambushers have been killed already"" and ""receiving sniper support during fire fights"".  During one of the Tech priest's system probes, he hacks her room and finds stuff that weirded everybody out.   [image 3]   Remember the scene in almost every anime ever where the MC walks into a girl's room only to find creep shots of him lining the wall?  This was like that but with an added, life size body pillow of him on her bed and her personal computer packed with even more creep shots of him and what can only be described as ""fan-fic"" of him.  Suffice to say he suffered san loss.  Not that it mattered though, phase 1 of our plan was done, now we could just leave while our inquisitor blew the station apart with his small fleet.  Ha Ha, NOPE! Turns out that we have to first get into the central data core, steal their hard drive that is the size and weight of an engine block. Then we have to get it back to the extraction zone and hold it there until Evac arrives.  The plan was hatched where we would first cut power to the station by destroying/venting the main reactor. Then venting the data core and retrieving it from the now atmosphere free room.  The whole op was done by the tech-priest hacking their systems with the Stormtrooper and Arbitrator grabbing the core, everyone else just had to look normal.   The assassin was to go to the markets and look like he was on business, buying weapon parts and bits for IEDs.  I on the meanwhile had to mill about the entertainment district. My whole reason there was stupid, badly planned out and downright dangerous.  My objective was essentially draw Petrov's attention by A) not being covered in armour, only civilian clothes B) being in a place where there were many ""Convenient"" places to have a data.  It didn't help that my clothes were a t-shirt and cargo pants, barely big enough to hold a las-pistol.  I essentially had to go and tangle with the feelings of a woman who not only owned a destroyer, but also was an ex-stormtrooper and had a unit of loyal followers who were ready to die so that she could have what she wanted.   The in-character response to this was ""Are you having a laugh?""  At 10:24 locatl time, He arrived at the fair.   [image 4]   At 4:15 after mission start, he encountered Janice.  Much to his surprise, she acted much more confidently than expected. Even suggesting a few attractions that they could do.  One was a shooting stall, they both won big with him beating her score. Just to add to the romantic-ness, he gave her the grand prize, a giant stuffed bear  on the roller-coaster she held his hand in a vice grip.  In the haunted house she hid behind him while he didn't flinch (some lucky rolls, thank the dice gods)  As She got lunch, he checked in and asked the other teams to hurry the fuck up.  On the ""Tunnel of Love"" (the GM was just making this worse at the time) she cuddled up to him while he showed affection (on the outside, internally he was wondering if the rest of his team were just watching him for the laughs.  On the tandem swing (a rope hung under an arc with a harness for two people) she clutches on him because love, while he tries to not have a mental breakdown because of her unsurprising wetness, sanity was burned to prevent catastrophic mission failure.  As the ""day"" comes to an end, they share one last meal in the simulated dusk.  Then thankfully, the power goes out  she panics, because she can't see him. His face however, is pic related [picture of man with AK-47, caption IT'S TIME]  thusly concealed, and able to see with his naturally good eyesight, he makes good his chance and gets the fuck out as she frantically tries searching for him.  Rendezvousing with the team at the extraction point, they promptly GTFO as the place is shelled by the inquisitorial cruiser they are leaving on.  The ship jumps to warp as enemy ships swarm out of the wrecked station   But this isn't the last appearance of the lovable loony, and if anons want, I can continue...  [image 5]  Now, before we start with the tale, I want to just recap the team, as because of PC deaths and players leaving because IRL stuff. The party includes the following:   A Stormtrooper,  A medic (arbitrator had to go, so a new gall joined),  a Tech-priest (now with 50% more metal),  And an ex-armsman (Assassin got rekt, new character).   Finally is our unfortunate main character, Johna Foulk, former demolition trooper of the Bagratian 1297 Fast Response Regiment. A man who was unprepared for the Inquisition, who generally frowns on property damage and explosives in general. Since the Operation to the asteroid station he had, among other things:   Aided in the destruction of a gene stealer hive by blowing it into a magma chamber, roasting the fuckers  Saved a planetary governor's daughter from cultists  Blown up half a planet (the dice gods were trying to save men from what lay ahead)   Anyways, let's get going!  [image 6]  Our Inquisitor sends us on a mission to investigate some shipping raids, at face value, it's nothing too deep and inquisition requiring. Just Pirates being Pirates.   Our first lead was to investigate a ship that had just been raided.  Upon inspection, we found that very little had been taken from the uninteresting cargo of assorted clothes and bed covers.  The one thing we gathered from scraps of footage that was left was that the attackers were equipped with equipment from Gorrandu Armouries, a privately owned manufactorum for military grade weapons and equipment.  We promptly head to the Garrandu plant, stopping by at the wreck of the asteroid base to check for things we can use.  Que a few sessions of searching for clues, things to knick and dodging things that were breaking / falling apart.  Finally arrive at the room formerly occupied by the former stalker girl.  Enter and find that all the pictures have been removed and the computer is gone.  Slightly worried but we don't get jumped so all's good in the hood.  We arrive on the planet where the Garrandu plant is located, only to find it seemingly abandoned.  Worry intensifies as we land and find that our signals are being jammed.  hasn'tthishappenedbefore.jpg  Ready guns and get moving towards the main command section of the plant."
DnDGreentext,2ye1q8,Itsthejoker,28,Mon Mar 9 07:00:12 2015 UTC,"[image 7]  [image]   In order to get to the command deck we have to pass through a few sections, the Forge (melting together metal for use in the plants), the production lines (divided into three more sections), and finally the Hab section (for workers and higher ups).  Getting through the forge is easy, it hasn't been activated in years so it's easy to get through.  The First production line produce Valkyne dropships, so getting through is easy, they provide great cover in a firefight.  The second one was construction of plate carriers and flak vests, which could be useful.  The third one produces endoskeletons for ""implantation"" into servitors.  Finally, we arrive at the hab blocks.  Many flights of stairs and much paranoia later, we arrive at the doors to the command room.  We bust the open door to find the room empty  No crew, no workers, but something entirely worse.  A great stuffed bear sits in the command seat, a box of chocolates and a letter sitting in its lap. The bear's very presence cause Johna to go deathly pale beneath his helmet. For he knows who it belongs to.  After all, he gave it to her...   [image 8]   When faced with an object that could clearly spell doom for you, your unit, or your bollocks, the smartest approach is to back away slowly, then call in an airstrike.  But Johna was not a smart man  Seriously, how the fuck can you call blowing up half a planet an ""accident""  Goddamn it Johna, you fucked up HARDCORE  Anyways, he approached the bear as the unit fanned out and started pressing buttons.  First thing he opened was the box of chocolates, which very surprisingly contained ACTUAL chocolate, not laced with paralysis toxins or anything.  Just behind that was a bottle of Bagratian Whisky, high level export shit. Also not Laced with anything.  The stuffed bear checked out to not have anything stuffed in it.  Finally, was the letter.  Interrupted by the CLANG of locking bulkheads  ""Nu-uh darling, that one is for later"" Janice announces over the intercom  inter-team radio is going crazy as the older guys criticize me jokingly about my poor choice in women while the Nuggets wonder what the fuck is going on and why the crazy lady is ranting about eternal love.  Janice says that if I give in then she'll let my comrades go while only doing pic related to me.  If I try to fight, then My friends will be turned into servitors without anesthetic.  Allowing the option to escape  To an inquisition agent who's formerly a demolitions trooper.  laughing Cadians.webm   [image 9]   You see, when the normal guardsman is trapped, he gets angry.  Now add 3 disposable rocket launchers, and a grav chute and multiply that total by Inquisition  Through this simple sum, you can clearly see that he has reached levels of ""fuck this shit"" that allow him to care little for things like future repercussions.  Thus, he packed up the assorted presents. Readied a launcher, and fired.  There were many things that Janice Petrov had planned for, but one thing she had not expected was the left wall of the command tower to explode out, followed by the whole inquisition team jumping to safety, behind her deployed troops.  Now in a prime spot, Johna did something sane.  He fucking legged it like 1001 Catachans running away from a rape victim. Everyone else following him with a similar gusto as they hit the deck.  For some men, the sound of gunfire is enough to get them bolting faster than they ever thought they could. For Johna it was the wailing cries of his psychopathic stalker who wanted to take away his limbs  Running past the traps, the odd team that tried to delay them, and re-activated machinery. The team made the best possible speed to the extraction zone.  All the time we had to listen to Janice's ranting. First starting out as boasting about how I wasn't going to escape, then progressing more and more towards frantically begging him not to go.  This was slightly offset by the other guys in the team making jokes about Johna's ""poor tastes"" when it comes to women.  Eventually we neared the extraction point, we could literally see the landing zone  Then the bulkheads closed.   [image 10]   So the bulkhead slams down, crushing a few unlucky boxes and cutting off our main avenue of escape.  Things go from TARFUN to FUBAR in about as many seconds as our team wasn't prepared for a holding action larger than surpressing about 10-30 people.  Thus we frantically start looking for a way to the landing pad, finding that escape in the form of a maintenance tunnel.  The good news is that once we're in, it's smooth sailing to the landing pad.  Bad news is that the door was locked, so our tech priest would have to unlock it.  At least she's shut up, now we can focus on setting up so that the force following doesn't kill us all.  By the time the enemy arrived, we had set up a few boxes as cover and built some gun carts.   And by gun carts, we jury-rigged four hand carts with ten lasguns each slaved to a single trigger, and slapped some pieces of Plasteel plating on them for armour and a rudimentary turret-like system so they could be used as emplacements.  So the enemy arrived and we cut them down.  Re-enforcements arrived and we cut them down.  Re-enforcements arrived and the Las-carts ran out of ammo, so we switched to our weapons.  Re-enforcements arrived and we killed them, but ran out of ammo so we had to bludgeon the last guy to death.  Finally however, the door was unlocked and we all piled through.  The maintenance shaft was dark and damp but no crazy women with axes jumped out so it was all cool.  Finally we arrived at the door to the section past the bulkhead.  We unlocked it and went the fuck through.  I'll give you three guesses as to what was there.   [image 11]   Not wanting to keep your arms and legs  Not wanting to be able to hug the ones you love  Not wanting your legs so you can romantically carry your lover away.  Thinking that ""do anything for you"" isn't a cover for ""murder anything that might keep you away from your new family""  So we turn the corner, and find ourselves staring down the barrel of a hellgun  A WILD STALKER HAS APPEARED  She asks us to drop our gear and turn around  Surprisingly to everyone, Johna starts to comply, dropping his hellgun, un-clipping his pistol and putting his bag on the ground.  Everyone else starts to comply as well.  That is until Johna does something that shouldn't have worked  Really, the dice gods either took pity on us, or were so pleased by the performance thus far that they wanted things to continue later.  Anyway, Johna's grand scheme was to throw the stuffed bear at her and hope that she was delayed long enough for everyone to get the fuck out and lock the door behind them.  And with an audible *Pomf* sound, the bear impacted.  Taking this opportunity, Johna grabbed most of his gear with one hand and the medic with the other before legging it.   And, as with the unspoken law of the military, when the unit saw their demolitions trooper running away, they tried to keep up.  And once out of the door, they closed it, locked it, and welded it shut just to make sure that little miss STALKER wouldn't follow.  We promptly arrive at the landing pad as the extraction craft arrives. We promptly get the fuck on and leave.  As the craft leaves, if one looked outside they could see Janice watching the craft go, rifle in one hand and teddy in the other.  She watched in horror as her love is carried away to parts unknown.  De-brief was conducted a few days later.  PDF and Arbites forces had stormed the plant, but found no trace of Miss Petrov.  Our mission was deemed a success and new call signs were provided  Mine was Heartbreaker   [image 12]  A few missions after we were assembled for a briefing   As our last mission had ended with everybody injured because our impromptu radioman fucked up grid references for an airstrike and everybody nearly died.  Our new mission was to go to a hive world. ""Officially"" our mission was to protect an inquisitor who was there to observe the handover of power to the planetary governor after his world was raided by chaos cultists.  Un-officially, we are there for R&R.  So, everyone grabbed their pre-loaded bags with pre-issued civilian clothes and got into the transport shuttle  Upon arriving at their assigned apartment (which was a penthouse suite that had five bedrooms, a pool and comfy fucking sofas). They all noticed five well wrapped packages with letters atop them with their individual names on them.  Que, Johna freaking the fuck out and pulling out his concealed hellpistol (that was meant to be left on the ship)  Yeah, he has had bad experiences with well-wrapped boxes in the middle of rooms at the tops of towers.  Upon opening the boxes, they find something much worse than present from their little friend  Dress uniforms, medals, and manuals on proper manicuring for officers  The sudden realizatioon that, they were all promoted to above Major and had enough medals on them to make a laspistol if melted down, turned out to be too much for the paranoia strained Johna and he decided to drink until he passed out.  The mail arrived the next day, including presents from high-ranking officials that we'd helped out. Johna gets worried at the amount of presents.  The rest of the time spent there is spent trying to get Paranoid Johna to relax.  A few days later, there is a grand ball at the governor's palace.  Johna is conviced that the pistol included in his dress uniform aren't sufficient enough. And he can't replace the pistol with his hellpistol.  The gala arrives and everyone arrives in their dress uniforms  Shit gets worse for Johna from here"

Now imagine the guardsman has seen hordes of damned cultists, has a creepy stalker and is in the presence of Lord commissars, planetary governors, Pious lords and an Inquisitor  Suffice to say that he is out of his depths like a fernisian kraken in the Bagratian swamplands.  If this couldn't get any worse, the planetary governor's daughter starts chatting with him.  This earns quite a few eyes on him and a commissar walking nearby.

Right?   [image 14]   Wrong  The governor's daughter asks if I want to dance.  Tell her that I was just about to suggest that. (Wasn't really going to, I never asked for this)  Roll high to not fuck up and not look classy  After three dances, the night ends, I bid her goodnight and leave.  During the ride back, the Inquisitor tells me that I did a good job at being classy  Alrighty.jpg  Arrive at the apartment, change from classy clothes to sleeping clothes and crash hard.  Wake up and go about with daily routine.  Shit continues normally, though Janice hasn't arrived so things are good.  Eventually, the day of the handover arrives, a grand ass event with press and officials.  The event broke down as a ceremonial crowning by a Cardinal followed by another grand ball, this time with press and Ecclesiarch officials.  This involves looking fancy.  Get a set of ""Special"" orders just for Johna.  In short, he had to act as a bodyguard for the Governor's daughter by masquerading as her suitor.  In response to this, He was given a temporary promotion to Colonel and a power sword and hell-pistol as dress equipment.  Is this Inquisitor serious?  No worries, not like there's going to be an attack. There's like a full regiment of Imperial guard on protection duty.  Nothing bad will happen.   [image 15]   The day of the handover.  Wake up at 05:00, get ready with everything fully cleaned, ready to leave at 06:15  Arrive at the governor's palace at 06:30, final equipment check at 07:00  Meet with the Governor's daughter at 07:05  She remarks that Johna looks nice, he returns the sentiment  The whole thing starts at 08:00  Spend time with the Governor's daughter, actually learn that the government is sort of like a monarchy. With her being the Princess.  worry.gif  At 08:00 sharp, the transport to the Ceremony arrives  It's a convoy of open topped cars escorted by Praetoran rough riders.  The route is 3 miles, lined with cheering supporters and he's expected to look friendly as opposed to a shaved baboon in a suit.  Our car is the fourth one in the convoy. First one is carrying the Planetary Governor, his wife, the Inquisitor and the team medic  Second contains his first son/prince and his wife.  Third contains his second son/prince and his wife.  The car behind us carries security guards.  As the cars pass down the street, the Governor's daughter/Princess waves her right hand while clutching Johna's hand with the other.  But Johna knows how to put on a straight face and grin and bear the pressure.  Eventually, the convoy arrives at the Cathedral that shall be used for the coronation.  Everyone files into the building and sits on the benches  The cameras roll, lengthy prayers and speeches are told. Then, finally. The governor is crowned.  It comes as just as much of a shock when he explodes.   [image 16]   Well, when I say HE explodes, I mean EVERYTHING within a meter of him was turned to a fine powder.  And of course, when something explodes, shit hits the fan.  Johna immediately forces the Princess down as people start shooting  People screaming as people are shooting them.  He promptly picks up the Princess and runs over to the Inquisitor and the rest of the unit. Easily getting the award for ""Most Overdressed Bodyguard"".  Turning around many nobles were lying dead and dying as someone poured into the stands with a heavy weapon. All the princes are dead.  Everyone instantly decides to try and get the fuck out, not getting killed.  Then a familiar voice drifts through the now silent cathedral.  ""Darling... where are you~""  Are you having a fucking giggle m8  Insert jokes about Miss Janice Petrov, resident Stalker and crazy lady.  Everyone promptly goes full splinter cell, sneaking past the heavily armoured troopers while their Commander tried to persuade me to join her and leave the other Harlots behind.  The shit he puts up with  Eventually, everyone arrives at the garage  We find out what has happened outside the cathedral  Remember that Suitor that Johna beat in a fair duel? Yeah, his family had enough political sway to pull a coup. And now we're in deep shit.  Just another day at the Inquisition, eh?   [image 17]  The only person expecting her was the guy who was ALWAYS paranoid.   we promptly decide that the best place to go is the space port, we can get a shuttle, get up to the ship in orbit and find out what the fuck is happening.  The Princess is in shock from watching her family be blown to ribbons.  The Inquisitor is having a bit of bench removed from his face.  Johna is worried.  We take back streets through the hive to get to the space port  Made slightly hard by the veritable fucktonne of Coup forces.  We eventually arrive at the spaceport, our shuttle pilot is waiting with the engines running.  Janice is also waiting with her unit and a mobile SAM. If we try and take off then we're fucked.  Team divides into two teams  Team A takes the Inquisitor and the Princess to the extraction  Team B rigs the SAM with high explosives.  Johna joins team B because he is demolitions trooper.  Promptly sneaking to the SAM, Team B finds that tere's a large number of troops defending it  They need a distraction in order to get close enough to destroy it.   Their solution is stolen off a dead enemy trooper.  The solution of course is a rocket launcher.  They run to the roof, ready the launcher to fire.  And a few seconds later, the SAM is a burning pile of crap.  Team B runs back to the extraction zone  As they run through the spaceport, they arrive at the Terminal, things are looking good  Then Johna gets shot in the leg."
DnDGreentext,2ye1q8,Itsthejoker,28,Mon Mar 9 07:00:44 2015 UTC,"[image 18]   So of course, Johna collapses like a sack of potatoes while everyone else dives into cover.  ""Darling, why are you running?"" Janice wonders aloud.  Yeah we all know who that is so lets not waste time adding in what she is.   At the very sound of her voice, the two other members of the team, the Stormtrooper and the Armsman both start shooting.  Under the cover of gunfire, Johna drags himself behind a ticket booth.  ""Darling, why must you hurt me like this?"" Janice asks.  More gunfire as her comrades run to assist.  ""Darling please, I just want to protect you!"" she wails.  Johna is still trying to turn his formal uniform's left sleep into a bandage.  The enemy starts getting closer, to Johna starts putting shots at the enemy.  He doesn't hit anything but it's enough to get the enemy to stay still long enough for his more healthy and unwounded comrades to be able to kill them.  Johna manages to drag himself behind the desk that the rest of the team is hiding behind.   After a few more turns of throwing grenades and shooting things, enemy fire has let up enough to be able to leg it back to the corridor that leads to the shuttle.  They take the opportunity, the stormtrooper helping Johna along the way.  As they escape, a few enemies stand up, only to get dropped a few seconds later.  They practically run down the cooridor.  As they near the end, Janice dives out of a door, Rifle raise.  She is quick, but Johna is quicker, he swings a punch.  And something breaks.   [image 19]   The moment his fist hit her face, she finally clicks.  She didn't understand why he ran before, why he didn't want to join her even though her terms seemed reasonable to her.  And now, in this moment of pain induced clarity, she finally understands what causedc him to run.  He wasn't playing hard to get, he wasn't being ordered away by someone with a gun to his back.  She was terrifying him with her single-minded devotion.  She had a sneaking suspicion of what that would mean, but now her worst fears were revealed to be true. And all of this is realised in under a second.  And that broke harder than even her hardened mind could tolerate.  She sprawled on the floor from the force of the blow and sobbed.  She drew he legs into the fetal position like a child trying to hide from reality itself. And sobbed.  ""I'm sorry..."" she muttered. Her voice barely audible above the whisper of autumn leaves being blown across the ground. The tone of her voice stopping the trio - it was the voice of a soul broken.  ""I tried... so hard to do what was best. I powered on through life... not caring about the next day..."" She spoke up, the odd sob breaking her contemplation..  ""I had nothing left, only a unit that only just trusted me."" Her voice quivered as she tried to overcome her sorrow.  ""Then one day I saw a man who looked just like he had been through the same as me..."" Her voice raised slightly, like she was remembering a fond memory.  ""And in the start, I just acknowledge him with a passing curiosity. But as time progressed, he met all expectation and I became interested in him. Perhaps too much."" She still had her head buried in her knees.  ""Then one day, I mustered the courage to approach him. He seemed so nice, he treated m so nicely, when he bested me, he gave his prize to me. When I was terrified, he stood tall and protected me."" She fondly remembered.   [image 20]   ""When we were connected together in that giant swing, I clutched to you because I was so scared, while you were so calm."" The top of her backpack snapped open from the strain, a familiar bear concealed inside. She reached over and brought it closer to her.  ""Then we had that meal, the best day of my life coming to an end and I wanted to run away with you, leave behind the cards given to me and start new."" Her voice was now dreamy. Her broken spirit trying to clutch to whatever source of happiness it could find.   ""Then the power went, you disappeared, I couldn't see you. And when my eyes adjusted to the darkness, you weren't there. Then the shelling started, I piled onto my ship with as many civilians as could get aboard before the habs took a direct hit."" Her voice now began to falter.  ""And on every one of the ships that escaped, you weren't on them. I didn't want to believe that you were gone."" Her voice continued to crack as she continued remembering their little trilogy from her perspective.  ""I tried to forget you, to push it to the back of my mind and focus on what was around. Then one day, a shuttle arrives. And guess wo walked off in body armour?"" Janice reflected.  ""I orchestrated it all, there were so many times where we could have ambushed you and taken you alive but unahppy... no, I wanted to give you a choice... but I got carried away. I said things I didn't mean and regretted later."" She reflected, her voice strained with regret.  ""And when you were gone, I had lost more than just you. I'd lost nearly everyone who trusted me. We bounced around trying to get by. My chances of seeing you again were so slim."" Her voice was barely audible.  ""Then, when we were here to assassinate the Governor and his family, we set up and waited. Then, by what I related to a gift from the Emperor himself, you were there. The impossible had happened and for a moment I was happy."" Her voice raised again, punctuated by the warmth of happiness.   [image 21]    ""But for some reason, when I saw you with the Governor's daughter, I felt an unexplainable rage at her. I thought she had corrupted you. I wanted nothing more than to rend her asunder like the saints of old. And when we attacked I could not understand why you would try and protect her. Maybe you were under orders to protect her?"" She wondered.  ""We searched for you, for anyone. But try as we might, all that was found was a pair of altar boys in the Cardinals room."" She continued. No-one was surprised by the last part.  ""We-redeployed here, partially to try to stop you if you tried to run. Partially to try and stop your charge from leaving the planet."" She continued. Her voice starting to break as her memories lead to their most recent addition.  ""When the SAM was destroyed, we gave chase, I ordered my men to shoot to wound, not kill. Even if it wasn't you. We were able to stop you for a time and I begged you to stop Darling. But you continued fighting."" Her voice continued to falter like the will of a conscript sandwiched between an enemy gun emplacement and a commissar.  ""A-And then I... I tried to flank around behind you... I-I wanted to try and stop the fighting non-lethally, I just wanted you to be safe with me... a-and then I c-came round the corner and y-you..."" The strain of remembering became too much for her and she broke, great howling wails escaping her.   No-one was sure if they should approach and comfort the apparently crazy lady. Sure they could see why she had done what she had done. She'd been pushed too far and just wanted some-one to comfort her. But they all remembered her threat at the weapons plant.  ""I-I love you, I would burn with a smile for you. But I remember what I've done to you and your friends. Why would you want me?"" She said with a dead voice as she pulled a straight, silver blade and pressed the tip against her chest.   [image 22]   Johna's tale is one of bittersweet, his regiment's very nature seemingly endorsed losses, his friends ended up cycled out of his unit into others which ended up lost to either enemy AA or being overwhelmed on the ground. He was then stolen away from what was left by a shadow organisation that erased his past life.  He'd watched friends be eaten alive by 'Nid swarms. Packed hab blocks flattened for strategic reasons and entire army groups thrown into a meat grinder front just to delay the enemy long enough for Astartes to come over and steal the credit.  He was sick and tierd of watching people die. He wanted nothing more than to go the fuck home, settle down an live peacefully on the hazard pay he'd earned in his life.  He knew that there was a time to wait, to act and to run. His speciality demanded it.  And now was a time to fucking ACT!  What happened next was a duel of speed, Wounded against emotionally and mentally fatigued.  As the blade moved into position, his wounded leg swung into action.  His foot connected with her knife hand and knocked the knife down the hall.  And before she could try and retrieve it or hurt herself, he slammed down next to her, and dragged her into his chest.  She sobbed hard, clutching onto him with the force of a powerlifter, anchoring herself to him while she sobbed into his chest.  It wasn't enough. It wasn't even close to enough. But it was more than anything she had been given before.  They had to move a short time later, both of them supporting each other to the shuttle.   [Epilogue]  After a whole admin bullshit, Janice was allowed into Johna's custody until her psychological condition could be evaluated. When the tests rolled around, she passed with a simple side note saying ""KEEP JOHNA NEAR"". And despite what happened before, she was allowed to be kept around, serving as personal maid/off-mission companion to Johna.  When the ""Endgame"" passed, The pair were sent back to Bagratian to live out a civilian life. Both of them undergoing regenerative treatment twice, one covered by the inquisition, another using money that they both had thanks to large amounts of hazard pay.  They both had 5 children together, 3 of which lead successful careers in the Imperial guard. And one joining an Adeptus Astartes Chapter. Their Linage remains to this day as one of the finest military families on Bagratian. They both wrote biographies, which gained massive popularity.      I'd personally like to thank all the Anons who have kept with me and read this tale.  Gentlemen, It has been an honour to write for you this day."

Gained two levels before an encounter where I had to heal an ally. DM called bullshit, had him check my character sheet again, had taken 2 levels of Ur Priest. He looks it up, we write back and forth, he hangs his head and says, ""XxXx is healed for 19hp."" He was a stickler for wording and taking things literally, and Warpriestis a subclass of Cleric, and the definition of subclass is a class that fills the role of another class, NOT a subtype of Cleric (or any other class). Never revealed to my fellow players how I was a healing priest in a godless world.   TL;DR Warpriest -> Ur Priest -> healer in a godless world.

We all get free drinks on the house. Sorceror had one drink and gets drunk  Throws vampire ash in a dwarfs face because he was being a dick to him.

He can't get it without waking her up  He decides to rip it out of her hands and cast scorching ray on her  She lights on fire screaming  I run up to the room with the screaming and find a half-clothed tiefling next to a pile of ashes  Tiefling tells the Bartender his other daughter who was the bar maid was actually a vampire  He suddenly brightened up from his crying as he was glad her suffering was ended  I'm still not sure if she was a real vampire or if it was scorching ray turning her to ash so quickly  suddenly a guy gets in the teamspeak server we were using given to us by one of the players  He says ""What are you guys up to in here?

When it was supposed to make me laugh it made laugh and the last post gives me the chills every time I read it.  Whenever someone tries to talk shit to me about 4chan, like how its a cancerous place full of bigots and trolls, I just show them this and tell them that freedom of expression is a two way street."
DnDGreentext,2xggv4,AuroraDawn,32,Sat Feb 28 15:53:07 2015 UTC,"4chan and reddit are exactly the same thing, just presented in different formatting. Whenever you gather a sizeable percentage of humanity and give them the option of untraceability, you're going to find a cure for cancer- and create a new cause at the same time.  You're right about the dialogue and different voices, too. If you like that sort of stuff, go read World War Z by Max Brooks. It's very similar in nature: a series of interviews with different people, and they all have a totally believeable personalities."
DnDGreentext,2xggv4,AuroraDawn,18,Sat Feb 28 15:57:15 2015 UTC,"I mean I've obviously read WWZ, as to your point about 4chan being the same thing as reddit I have to disagree.  Reddit works much better than 4chan as a content aggregator, a place for reading the news essentially, but doesn't lend itself to having actual discussions, as ebin meme joker posts or posts by internet celebrities float right to the top, while any posts which disagree from a generally accepted point of view get downvoted into oblivion by people who don't know what a downvote is for.  4chan is a forum in the purest sense, outside of some cancerous tripfags/avatarfags everyone is assessed purely on the quality of their post.  This and the fact that the mods (THEY DO IT FOR FREE) are pretty much inactive means that, while you still see memeing and circlejerking, people with unique ideas/points of view are actually visible.  Again, two way street, so you end up getting things like /pol/ from this, but you get some awesome shit too."

I feel like the pc would know that there was 20 goblins if they had stolen his stuff before. just because the player doesn't ask doesn't mean the pc wouldn't know. There are times the dm should speak up rather than fuck with his players'. This is the stuff that breeds paranoia. It turns sessions into 2 hour discussions about how to best go through a door rather than progressing a story line. the op's story is different because the pcs wouldn't have known before while in this instance it seems like the pc would have know better even though the player didn't.

DnDGreentext,2x4yvk,Lameguy01,10,Wed Feb 25 23:08:07 2015 UTC,"This is reminding me of the time I sent my party to the Plane of Secrets to retrieve information.  It was a gargantuan library, and every piece of information being intentionally concealed from anyone else was recorded--somewhere--inside.  New secrets caused new books, and sometimes entire new bookcases, to form.  It was maintained by devotees to the God of Secrets.  The organization of the devotees was, in and of itself, a secret, so their internal documentation would regenerate on the plane if destroyed.  The same is true of the identities of the devotees, which made them very prone to infiltration.  It was a silly system.  They set the plane on fire on their way out."

DnDGreentext,2x6i45,Vyndren,2,Thu Feb 26 16:42:03 2015 UTC,"Looks like you enjoyed playing your character alot! Happens often for a first character too die in a stupid way and having your DM magically bring him back to life.  LOLED so hard a that :   He may not be able to cast like a wizard, but he will have scrolls.  Hundreds of scrolls. Thousands of scrolls. He'll set up his own scroll shop."
DnDGreentext,2wwn59,BishopMiles,92,Mon Feb 23 20:12:22 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of the Barbarian who was convinced he was a wizard. Would yell ""MAGE HAND!"" when picking anything up, stuff like that. Stared real hard at what he called his spellbook each morning, despite being illiterate.  Edit: It's in this thread. All Barbarian party.   To be fair, one person was a barbarian who thought he was a wizard. He'd attempt to use a particularly large stick to channel magic through, then when it didn't work, he'd get pissed and bash the monster's head in. He was still a barbarian though. And another person was a barbarian who'd become ""refined"", and as such was the only person in the party who could actually read.  Fast forwarding a bit. After a long ride out to the hideout of the horse thief, during which we praised Grogg a lot for his astounding ability to read, we finally get to the cave system he'd been using (a little cliched, I know, but the DM is a fan of such things). We dismount, and after a few minutes of planning, decide that we're going to try and sneak up to the entrance.  DM: Well, the thief has a couple of sentries posted. M: Okay guys, I have an idea. Let's disguise one of us as a tree and sneak up on them. We all agree this is a fantastic idea. DM: Fine, roll then. M rolls a disguise check, and we assist him, giving him a +4 to disguise himself as a tree. He rolls a 13, which gives   him a 17 to the roll, making it a success. His roll to sneak, however, is another story; he rolls a 6, which takes a -2 because he's disguised himself as a fucking tree.  DM: The sentries notice you. M: I cast Sleep on them. We all look at M like he's gone bananas. J: You said you were a barbarian! M: I am, just listen.    He then proceeds to tell us how his barbarian pulls out his arcane-carved stick, wave it around chanting nonsense for a few seconds, then point it at the two guards, shouting, ""SLEEP NOW!"" Both M's barbarian and the guards are perplexed; the barbarian because he doesn't know why the spell didn't work, and the guards because they don't know what the fuck is happening.  So M's barbarian did the only thing a barbarian would possibly do in that situation: get frustrated and bash them over the head with his ""wizard staff"", knocking them out cold.   Edit II: I was wrong, the one I'm thinking of is this one."
DnDGreentext,2wwn59,TristanTheViking,44,Mon Feb 23 22:20:19 2015 UTC,It's too bad that in many systems there are penalties for multiclassing. How cool would it be to give that barbarian some sorcerer abilities after pretending to be a wizard for so long?  Maybe create a prestige class - barbarian magus or somesuch.
DnDGreentext,2wwn59,KapitanTurtle,12,Mon Feb 23 22:27:22 2015 UTC,In 3.5 there is a prestige class called Rage-Mage that is pretty much exactly that.

DnDGreentext,2wkoff,IronOxide42,60,Fri Feb 20 23:56:34 2015 UTC,"Nah. Just wanted something not too ridiculous for an entire campaign. If he had a stick up his ass he would just have just gone ""no"" right off the bat."

DnDGreentext,2wkoff,nox1468,-14,Sat Mar 7 21:37:22 2015 UTC,that's a wonderful story and a shitty DM. If one of my players did this I would love them.
DnDGreentext,2wkoff,lolbifrons,45,Sat Feb 21 17:39:22 2015 UTC,Not every one wants all their games silly. It's pretty rude to call the DM shitty for something like this.

DnDGreentext,2whadb,horseradish1,25,Thu Feb 19 23:28:46 2015 UTC,Yeah I figured for the hell of it I'd make the dick slap do more damage because Clayton had a ragin boner from all the combat.
DnDGreentext,2whadb,Radid,34,Thu Feb 19 23:31:02 2015 UTC,"I would have made the dick strike cost the player. Like, the wolf is pleased at this presentation of a meaty snack, and happily eats the proffered member.  this would give the wolf all the comfort it would need to join the group."

DnDGreentext,2w5i8k,Nethnarei,10,Wed Feb 25 12:14:29 2015 UTC,"Nice one, but why is the natural 1 of any importance? Nat 1's and 20's are only auto-fails or hits in attack rolls, no?"
DnDGreentext,2w5i8k,Jowobo,22,Tue Feb 17 09:28:52 2015 UTC,"A lot of house rules give them importance on other rolls as well.   Also, if it was an opposed check (say, Bluff VS Sense Motive to convince the merchant that this bet was a great idea), it might have been low enough to make the merchant lose out even with situational modifiers to his advantage."
DnDGreentext,2w5i8k,Nethnarei,12,Tue Feb 17 10:23:47 2015 UTC,"True, natural one, you need a serious buff/modifier to overcome a DC in this case. But the way the OP puts it, I'm supposing they intended nat 1 as a auto-fail. It's just my most hated house rule. I have a new player at my table who lives by this rule. 'I rolled a 20 on my wisdom check! I succeeded!' No you didn't, you're at -1 and the DC is 25. Can't get it through his head.."
DnDGreentext,2w5i8k,TerminusEst86,11,Tue Feb 17 12:27:31 2015 UTC,"Yea.  For something like this, I'd rule the NPC shouldn't have to roll, because there's literally no reason for him to agree.  It's like trying to roll Bluff that the sky is purple polka dots.  The best you're going to do is convince the man that YOU think the sky is purple polka dots.  He still knows it's blue."
DnDGreentext,2w5i8k,Nethnarei,7,Tue Feb 17 13:14:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly, now if the bet was worded otherwise, in a sense that the merchant would have gained something from failure... I don't know, actually paying 20000 GP or having someone from the party work for free for an entire month, or... But this bet doesn't make any sense. Dumb merchant IMO, would go bankrupt in a week!  EDIT: also, since can PC's tell a DM to roll for something if it isn't in a skill (say a saving throw for a breath weapon or something)? If the DM would have just said (in character): What do you take me for? An idiot? Get lost! -> The matter would have been resolved"
DnDGreentext,2w5i8k,TerminusEst86,9,Tue Feb 17 13:53:41 2015 UTC,"Yep.  I'm reminded of the time a player tried to seduce the Male NPC with their Female PC in a World of Darkness game.  ""But I have Presence 4, Manipulation 4, Persuasion 4, and Striking Looks!""  ""And unless you're disguising yourself as a man it's not going to matter as he's still gay.  You can probably persuade him with other means with those stats, but sex is out unless you magically grow a penis."""
DnDGreentext,2w5i8k,Kiloku,2,Tue Feb 17 14:11:25 2015 UTC,"I absolutely despise it when players try to bring sex into everything.

DnDGreentext,2w5i8k,Jowobo,5,Thu Mar 12 20:33:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree there. I'll usually throw a little snippet at my players on a nat-20 on failed knowledge or something like that, more of a hunch or general impression (or sometimes just something they could have found out anyway, but missed/didn't connect).   I'd never treat it as auto-success.  It's roleplay, you can try anything. Doesn't mean that everything will actually work."
DnDGreentext,2w5i8k,EUWCael,1 point,Tue Feb 17 14:51:47 2015 UTC,"My first DM had this rule that you could try anything, he'd set an arbitrary DC and if you rolled 20 you cold reroll. Like, if you could go ""I concentrate really hard and try to destroy the universe"" and he'd go ""DC 1000, go for it"" (or, more mundane stuff like ""I try to shoot an arrow into that guy's eye, on the other side of the river"" ""AC 47 go for it"")"

DnDGreentext,2w5i8k,kRkthOr,6,Tue Feb 17 08:56:32 2015 UTC,I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. I assumed DM was acting OOC.
DnDGreentext,2w5i8k,Alaylarsam,8,Tue Feb 17 09:17:17 2015 UTC,"Think about it this way, the merchant gained nothing from that bet, why would he agree? Just for shits and giggles?"
DnDGreentext,2w5i8k,kRkthOr,10,Tue Feb 17 09:09:18 2015 UTC,"You're right about that; there was no actual reason for this to have happened.  I just requested a roll for this and the DM agreed.  We do use the house rule of a natural 1 causing something extraordinarily bad for the roller.  The funny thing is: we don't even use the boat now, we have flying brooms and carpets."

They kinda went through too much walking around woods and were getting bored, so I livened things up.   Didn't really have a revolving door so much as the cleric had been such a lawful good that his god was appeased and wanted to do something nice for such a devout follower.   edit: Also the cleric was at a -1 and one more hit point and he would have died, I figured if he was slapped and the Heal check failed the cleric would take damage for being slapped."

DnDGreentext,2vxlfl,SpinelessCoward,8,Sun Feb 15 05:35:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I left out details.  Wizard was with us the whole time, just did not get knocked out, DM never gave a purpose to the big room (or I don't remember), the Doppleganger was trying to impersonate a dwarf while working for the dwarven city, and the gnome was the one that was actually supposed to be doing what the Doppleganger was doing."

DnDGreentext,2vviu9,Soren635,44,Sat Feb 14 16:06:35 2015 UTC,"I usually don't make it my business to kill my pals. Some backstory to this is our group is 4 people that have been playing together a long time. Quite close, and this was supposed to just be a 1 off and we weren't gonna use our characters again. We were just having fun, I wouldn't do this if I didn't know the group as well as I did, and everyone had a good laugh about it. If they ere using characters that they have been using for a while, or took a long time to craft I wouldn't have been that guy. But sometimes it's fun to be that guy I suppose."

DnDGreentext,2vtp3w,opmsdd,60,Mon Feb 16 15:14:29 2015 UTC,That is actually really clever. I feel like maybe that would be built really well into a campaign especially revolving around a fallen paladin or one about to fall.

From what I understand from the first character, you were second in command and apparently ordered to walk the plank for following the captain's orders? Something smells.  The DM demanding will saves for the second character's desire to suicide bomb is ridiculous. Unless you were under a severe magical compulsion or something similar, you shouldn't have to make a save against something like that. You don't make will saves when you see food or an attractive woman.  I wouldn't have even made a third character. These guys aren't worth your time. If you need another group, check /r/lfg."

Our biggest problem is a few people trying to be as ridiculous as possible (trying to fuck trees and merfolk) while I'm at least trying to be mostly normal with my character

DnDGreentext,2v90cu,Dozer1170,9,Mon Feb 9 16:08:48 2015 UTC,I always try to think 'what would my character do' instead of 'what would be wise'. So we usually have inner party checks because of that. It resolves in pickpocketing sometimes or situations like above.

My character in an Age of Rebellion game I'm playing atm forces me to roll deception on most other members of the party, and because I rp it well they're cool with it, and I don't fuck over the party so it's no big deal.  Last session though I had to roll Diplomacy on our ship Captain. The guy playing him is kind of 'too serious'. It's a fairly serious game, but I get the feeling the DM wants us to adventure and have fun with it. Anywho, we had two choices and this guy had been choosing the safest option as far as his ship was concerned every time. We had a vote and everyone except him voted to pursue the guy who wee think fucked us over at the start of the campaign, but he refused to pilot us to the planet (Nar Shaddaa, why would you not want to go?). I ended up rolling Diplomacy for it, which I have a fairly high skill in (I play a Diplomat Agitator) but the DM said he'd give me a boost die if I did a inspiring speech to go with it. I'm really new to P&P games (this is my first one) so I had nothing prepared. I ended up ab-libbing something that sounded a lot like it belonged in the Godfather. Still got the boost die, rolled a failure but with a triumph. The DM says everyone except the Captain is now extremely convinced and applauded my character after his speech, and the Captain would probably feel pretty unsafe if he refused to fly us there now.   I know it sounded like railroading but honestly, this guy had been playing Lawful Good, super safe option every time the whole campaign."

Easy peasy, my character 'thinks' it's fake. Let's try again...

MIMMOTHS   Large sections of the world are completely uninhabitable because they're filled with infinite things  Unfortunately, I had just gotten off a night shift, and a couple people didn't make it, so it wasn't very good"

DnDGreentext,2ukj3r,RedKirby,4,Tue Feb 3 06:17:24 2015 UTC,"Lately I've see a lot of posts requesting certain stories, but I would think it'd make it easier to find what you're looking for with tags!"
DnDGreentext,2ukj3r,dumkaf,9,Tue Feb 3 06:18:44 2015 UTC,"I really want to avoid edition warring in this sub.   You only need to look at /r/dnd and see the vote counts for 3.5 posts vs. 4 posts to see that putting the edition number is a bad idea when the narrative is the only important part. (It's fine in that subreddit because mechanics matter.)   That said, I might be interested in putting in [DnD/Pathfinder], [Feng Shui], [Star Wars RPG], etc. The issue then becomes that there are simply so many different systems that creating relevant flair for them all is difficult, and even once it's done, it'll make the menu for selecting flair ridiculously long."
DnDGreentext,2ukj3r,Zagorath,2,Wed Feb 4 03:04:41 2015 UTC,"The editions shouldn't be the issue on this sub, however.  The stories are the content of the sub, not the edition itself.  If it devolves down to such a circle jerk, then remove the tags maybe?  It can't hurt to try it for a little while."
DnDGreentext,2ukj3r,dumkaf,5,Wed Feb 4 18:10:28 2015 UTC,"The stories are the content of the sub, not the edition itself   Which is exactly the reason I don't really see the need for this. Readers don't really gain anything from knowing the edition — it isn't useful in deciding which content to read (which is the main purpose of tagging), and has very limited use in terms of interpreting what they've read (a major secondary use). So why have them at all?"
DnDGreentext,2ukj3r,WDS_NCS,4,Wed Feb 4 18:22:13 2015 UTC,"I can see your point and concerns.  I thought and agreed on the grounds it would be a nice idea simply for that it can help fill out the sub a little bit more, and help give some context on (especially for some of the more silly actions taken by a player) if something like that is possible in a certain edition.  Not so that people can call out a made up story (I enjoy stories), but just to have more information overall.  If you really feel like it would cause more problems than needed, then that's reason enough for me."
DnDGreentext,2ukj3r,Dr_Duality,3,Wed Feb 4 19:09:30 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: While I'm okay with the decision to not include tags out of concern for starting edition flamewars, I will say that I get more out of a story where I know the general rules of the world. I do actually usually leave stories unfinished when I'm unfamiliar with or uninterested in the system, so it would be convenient to know what's what by skimming the titles.   I guess it bears explaining why I think knowing the system adds something. Part of it is being able to visualize the players and game in those stories that don't offer much in the way of context. A lot of it is knowing exactly how unlikely some occurrence is or how hard something is to achieve. You survive a fall of 100ft. on to a dragon's back and then one shot it? D&D 3.5, level 20 monk? Not super impressive. Level 3 barbarian? Holy hell!  It also affects things like the humour. Werewolf: The Apocalypse game where everybody's a Red Talon in Chicago? Inherently funny to me. Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game, team consisting of a Quixotic Jedi, a Protocol Droid, and a Gamorean? I'm already picturing how that's going to go. I just don't engage with it the same way if I don't know the system.  Of course, a lot of this information about systems could be communicated in the body of a post. I just think it'd be nifty to have it in the titles. :)"

Literally the most expert swordsman the world had ever seen! Thankfully my expertise has let me make far more attacks in a round than anyone else could ever attempt. Now lets see what happens when I have a 40% chance of a critical failure once every 6 seconds. Oh. What's that? You mean that even though I'm a fucking god at fighting, I am likely to accidentally kill myself or allies around me every 10 seconds?  Fuck critical failure. PF handles it perfectly. You rolled a 1 on an attack or a save? You fail even if it had been high enough on it's own. Literally any other situation? NOTHING.   They're absurd and add nothing to the game except arbitrary and unfair chaos. ""You stab yourself for maximum damage"" fuck that.

So, his character was nigh-unbeatable and was bloodthirsty and an asshole and ruined anything we tried to do other than mindless killing. The worst part is that the DM started trying to ""adapt to our party"" because we were killing shit too fast so he made all the enemies stronger, which just meant that douchebag McThatguy was the only one who stood a chance against them while the rest of us had to run and hide during all the fights."

DnDGreentext,2troui,natsirtenal,8,Tue Jan 27 02:19:05 2015 UTC,To be honest I understand the other players view if they never played D&D before. I play with 6 friends DSA (The Dark Eye in English IIRC) and because we never played a pen&paper before we didn't really roleplay at all and did what came to our mind first.   In our very first campaign we met a trader in the beginning who offered us a place to sleep at night. Our thief instantly tries to steal as much stuff as possible and our dwarf starts throwing potatoes at the trader. Later on some players of our group decide that one main quest character annoys them too much and they killed him while he slept and no one really gave a fuck. It took us several sessions to even start thinking about our characters and what they would do in which situation.   Also we expected loot from enemies which does not exist in DSA because it's main focus is the roleplay and not to get stronger and fuck shit up.  I know how much this behaviour frustrates experienced players but I can also understand it because I was once like them.
DnDGreentext,2troui,MadJim8896,5,Wed Jan 28 03:39:46 2015 UTC,Except this was far from their first campaign together. This was just how they played. Always. Forever.
DnDGreentext,2troui,BucketHelm,4,Wed Jan 28 16:46:10 2015 UTC,"I feel like loot should exist and make sense but be a small enough thing to not give you a reason to specifically seek it out. For instance, if you are attacked by and defeat bandits they should be equipped adequately and you should be able to get it...but likely any armor was ruined in the finishing blows, any swords are chipped or worn from disuse. Sometimes you find usable things but most of the time whatever attacking you left behind damaged equipment or used enough that without repairs it's not sellable.   For instance in the above example I'll allow looting of the armor and weapons but require craft checks before they can sell them, and then when they sell them they get 1/8-1/5 the price of a new item because it's been obviously used and refurbished.   Killing a bunch of goblins that probably don't have armor and are using extremely worn and pilfered or just thrown together from scraps weapons is not going to get you any real loot. Nothing compared to what you're going to get from the town for ridding them of the problem anyways, and you can always get a better quest afterwards if money and equipment is your real goal."
DnDGreentext,2troui,BucketHelm,12,Wed Jan 28 22:57:45 2015 UTC,"The best thing about that is that your actions in-game are pretty much what I'd expect a CN-CE character to do. ""Oh, you're going to kill my captive just because? Okay. Then I'll kill you just because."""

They would've received about the same amount of net loot in the campaign because the DM has WBL to abide by. It just would've come in the form of ""the head goblin's treasure"" or something instead of goblin weapons and armour en masse. Hell, goblin treasure would've been better, since it'd probably be less weight for the same value."

DnDGreentext,2tdloz,derfofdeath,14,Fri Jan 23 08:02:36 2015 UTC,"What is it like playing in an epic game?  Meaning both a game above level 20 and a game that just has absolutely insane exploits like the ones you have detailed.  Also, how were you able to keep your true class a secret for so long OOC?"
DnDGreentext,2tdloz,derfofdeath,13,Fri Jan 23 09:29:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't know how it's different from playing regular games, other than we're higher level and have access to the epic feats and gear.   As for the crazy exploits, it's kind of like... well, honestly, it's like playing the main characters you read about in books. You get ridiculously powerful and can do crazy stuff, to the point where your smallest decisions can have an effect on the story in interesting ways.   We play to tell a story, really. I'm writing a series of books about our first campaign, which lasted somewhere around 6 years.   Keeping the secret was actually pretty easy. I obviously didn't let anyone see my character sheet, except the DM, and I had very careful positioning in-character when we were in combat. The first person to find out was Phendric, and he didn't tell anyone because he wanted everyone else to be surprised. Really it comes down to having great friends who don't like metagaming."
DnDGreentext,2tdloz,EightEx,10,Fri Jan 23 09:40:28 2015 UTC,"I mean, you had to be rolling extra things like sneak attack dice and such, were you just not taking advantage of it for the sake of keeping the secret?"

Take what you get, have a flexible story and enjoy yourself. What I do is create a timeline of things that will occur, and when my players do stuff,  it sometimes alters those events. Example, players raid a dungeon that locked away great powers inside. To obtain the power, they have to undo all the seals of the place. Well the place was previously a prison, so to get there, they effectively unleashed ancient creatures into world. Some good, some bad. Well you get the gist of it."

DnDGreentext,2t4368,march1studios,17,Wed Jan 21 07:03:17 2015 UTC,I'm trying to figure out what story to tell next. Should I keep going with the PKs or switch it up to the other ridiculously awesome things he's done for now?
DnDGreentext,2t4368,march1studios,11,Wed Jan 21 07:06:55 2015 UTC,"I just took a quick scan through the comments, you've made about Kyle, and I think the PK stories are what makes it amazing. The player reactions are what makes it amazing.  I would have loved to hear a) how Rosaline knew you were Kyle, and b) what her OOC reaction was when you teleported and snapped her neck."
DnDGreentext,2t4368,march1studios,21,Wed Jan 21 07:09:34 2015 UTC,"Ah, I can actually satisfy both of those!   Rosaline knew my identity because I was careless, mostly. She was my new partner, basically, and when I would go out with Phendrid, I could slip off in the night and do extra recon or some of the side quests I'd picked up from various NPCs, whether they were assassinations, thefts, whatever, didn't matter.  She had skills Phendrid didn't have, and noticed me slipping off one night. She was able to follow me through use of True Sight and incredibly high hide/move silently mods. She alerted the Inquisitors (I actually had no idea she was a member) that she'd found an assassin, and they tasked her with keeping an eye on me and luring me away from the group so they could capture me. They eventually figured out I was Kyle Neffzen, because Rosaline overheard someone calling me as such one of the times she tailed me.  After the teleportation, the DM said Rosaline would be confused. I took this to mean she'd suffer from a weaker will save. The ring of Dominate Person paid off perfectly yet again. Once she failed her save, the player looked at me a just said, ""Fuuuuuuck, just make it quick alright?""  Kyle pretty much always makes it quick. He actually held Rosaline in great respect, as the only person to ever match his ability in espionage. She only made one mistake, and that's not knowing what his equipment did.   The Player actually cried a bit after the session (this wasn't where I ended) and I felt pretty bad, so I said I was sorry for what happened.  She said, ""I'm not sad because I died, I'm sad because I didn't even get to have my own thoughts in my head when I did."" It was actually pretty deep."
DnDGreentext,2t4368,march1studios,11,Wed Jan 21 07:23:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, wow. That's a mind fuck.   Do all the players know OOC what you are now? Or only the two that played Rosaline and Phendrid? How do you not meta that!? It would kill me!"
DnDGreentext,2t4368,LordJackdaw,15,Wed Jan 21 07:33:36 2015 UTC,"Well, currently in the game, the Paladin that was in my party, Shadon, is now the leader of the Inquisitors and trying to capture me, as I'm the most infamous assassin-type in the world, lead a mercenary guild that is heading a war on his country, and killed his master.  The Cleric, Sarah, is Shadon's right hand.   Kraityn, the Red Dragon Disciple, is my right hand, the figurehead of Shadowmoore, my guild.  Rosaline's player rolled a new character named ""Emilia Ebonlocke"" and is, essentially, my lover/apprentice.   A 6th player has been added, a Cleric/Fighter/Weaponmaster who goes by the name of Trylon. He's under Sarah's command.   Our DM is really pulling out the stops. He runs two sessions a week now, because our party split, and says he's having an awesome time.   So, to answer your question: Everyone knows (clearly). Rosaline and Phendrid's players are absolutely awesome at not metagaming, as are the rest of us. We try to immerse ourselves in the game as much as possible, and no one wants to ruin the surprises!"

DnDGreentext,2t4368,wolfdreams01,-16,Wed Jan 21 04:15:24 2015 UTC,"I'm tired of players who think they're awesomely clever for being PC killers.  Killing PCs is ridiculously easy if they're unaware of your identity and you get the drop on them, to the degree that it's actually kind of pathetic to brag about it.  I mean, you can tailor your build specifically towards killing PCs while they're tailoring theirs towards killing monsters.  It's not a fair fight at all.  The most awesome PC death game I ever played was a PbEM game where there were three separate adventuring parties who all opposed each other.  THAT was a challenge because we all knew we were against each other from the start, and I considered myself lucky to win even though half my party was dead by the end of it.  But all this ""super badass assassin"" stuff just doesn't strike a chord, because it's so goddamn easy to be the lone wolf taking people by surprise.  Getting a diverse group to work together effectively, on the other hand?  Now that's the real challenge."
DnDGreentext,2t4368,derfofdeath,9,Thu Jan 22 19:29:21 2015 UTC,"I was level 22 when I killed my first PC; a full year into the campaign. I'm clearly not a player killer, generally speaking. Kyle has stuff to do, and people that endanger his cover (or life) have to be dealt with.   Rosaline knew what she was getting into. She brought it on herself, to be completely honest. She knew that if she fucked up, she was dead, 100%. If she'd managed to capture Kyle, he faced execution. In a case of ""my life or yours,"" Kyle will choose his 10 times out of 10.  If you actually paid attention, Kyle didn't want to kill either of his party members. He only did so because he had no choice."
DnDGreentext,2t4368,based_bear_god,-12,Thu Jan 22 19:52:26 2015 UTC,"I feel that the tone of both your posts (the first one in particular) really comes off as bragging, and obviously I can't read your mind, but from the way you describe what happened, it seems like you're really proud of these easy kills.  You shouldn't be proud of this - like, at all.  You knew from the start that there was a high chance of PC conflict if they discovered your identity, and you had 22 levels to build up your character with that possibility in mind.  The other players did not have this information - they were thinking in terms of combat against monsters.  You had a huge advantage over them.  I don't care about the ideology of PC killings (I played Vampire LARPs where this kind of thing was common), but the complete unfairness of it and the way the deck was hugely stacked in your favor - in combination with how you try to make this sound like the coolest thing ever - is what bothers me.  From my reading, it sounds like you basically took candy from a baby, and then told it in a very grimdark way ""I'm Kyle Neffzen, bitch, and you crossed the wrong person.  I hope you enjoy that pacifier, because it's the last one you'll ever have."""
DnDGreentext,2t4368,based_bear_god,12,Thu Jan 22 20:32:19 2015 UTC,"Clearly I'm proud of them, but it's not in the ""I'm such a badass because I took out a player"" way, it's more a ""I played my character exactly how I envisioned him"" way.   My character wasn't build to kill players, it was built to kill everything. I've killed Dragons, recently killed a Lich, I've made (I think) 27 assassinations thus far, not including the 3 players I've killed.   Your problem is that you glorify the PCs.   A PC is absolutely no different from an NPC RP-wise, and the fact that a character is played by a person should never, ever have an effect on your RP.  So, Kyle treated them like they were enemies, which they were.   Also, I have no idea what you're talking about. Building your character to be a player killer is metagaming (because it will cause you to seek confrontation whether or not your character would actually do so), which I do not do. I build my characters to fit their RP, 100% of the time.  Saying stuff like ""It's totally unfair, you planned all of this"" is ridiculous. Did I know it could happen? Sure. Did I try to avoid it? Yes, because my character doesn't like killing people he relies on. Do I actually care that they happened? No, not really. It fit my character's RP, just like their actions fit their character.   You're saying that I'm gloating because I killed PCs, in reality I actually feel kind of bad. Neither of their characters died in a way that fit them, but that's how it happens sometimes.   Imo, don't try to out an assassin, and you won't get killed. Phendrid didn't really know what was coming, but Rosaline sure as hell did. I mean, sure, both were easy, but that doesn't take away from the reasoning behind it, which certainly wasn't ""because I can."""

DnDGreentext,2t0jmh,TheKiltedStranger,18,Tue Jan 20 16:46:29 2015 UTC,"We're playing a good-aligned campaign. The Paladins in this world are very well connected, and rarely challenged when trying to set up meetings with higher-ups.   So, Paladin gets us in to talk to whoever. Frederic isn't really involved with these meetings; I slip off and investigate the building, take some notes, etc. Then I ask what happened in the meeting when I'm with the party again.  Our group is often called upon to handle diplomatic missions. I sneak back into the place, offer an alternative answer  to the problem. Essentially I'm using the party to find work. Go on our diplomatic mission, slip the guy in charge a slow-acting poison, and he dies two weeks later without making us look bad.  His backstory is that he's supposed to be watching the Cleric. She was the head of the order's daughter, and he hired Kyle to keep her safe. It's been ongoing since level 1.she can't know, and it's easier to keep the secret from everyone ratherthan just one person.   I killed the mage because he specifically saw me using Assassin spells. If he'd told the rest of the party, I would have been forced to leave by the Paladin and the Cleric, thus unable to continue my job.  Phendrid's player was pretty livid that he died without being able to do anything about it, but he failed a death attack save, so meh. He was very impressed I'd been able to keep the secret of my character for this long, even moreso that I'd done it ooc."

DnDGreentext,2szt2e,Ulquiorra_Schiffer,2,Tue Jan 20 05:41:10 2015 UTC,What kind of introduction is that?
DnDGreentext,2szt2e,wolfdreams01,25,Tue Jan 20 02:38:44 2015 UTC,A magical one?
DnDGreentext,2szt2e,Ulquiorra_Schiffer,-47,Tue Jan 20 02:47:21 2015 UTC,"I think that was really shit. Makes sense in character, and by all means, roleplay the character in a way that makes sense, but this is ridiculous.   Were I the DM, I'd either accept it, and punish you, or ignore the attack completely. Player deaths are fine with me, but not before they've even really joined the campaign. That's just being exclusionary."
DnDGreentext,2szt2e,SadisticBuddha,45,Tue Jan 20 01:47:34 2015 UTC,"Someone runs at me with a sword, I shoot them, that's just common sense.  Husband should have thought of some better background story to join the group, and the DM was just a lazy idiot for not mandating it herself."
DnDGreentext,2szt2e,Ulquiorra_Schiffer,-50,Tue Jan 20 02:58:20 2015 UTC,"I don't care, that's not how I play or what I would allow. Roleplay is fine, but don't be exclusionary. It causes fights IRL."
DnDGreentext,2szt2e,Imnotbrown,35,Tue Jan 20 06:26:55 2015 UTC,"Needless player deaths are shit, we can all agree they're not the most enjoyable of things.   But what the husband did got himself killed, he could've stopped and had fair warning when he was being the idiot.   If you don't let players die when they're stupid it reduces the agency of the players because suddenly their decisions and actions could be retconned out of the game's reality. And that is much worse than a self inflicted player death."
DnDGreentext,2szt2e,Ulquiorra_Schiffer,-40,Tue Jan 20 06:59:27 2015 UTC,"Being stupid is different from someone else being a dick. if he charged at a sleeping dragon, he'd probably die. He might get a lucky roll(s), but he'll probably fail.   Running at the main group is a shitty reason to kill a guy. He could have been out for a jog. There is no information at all justifying the PK to me.   Regardless, this is all my opinion. Play your games how you want, but no one is going to change my view on this."

DnDGreentext,2sxlld,ChocolateCoated,2,Thu Jan 22 10:21:45 2015 UTC,Dwarves are actually more likely to fight when they are outnumbered or outmatched due to their stubborn nature preventing them from conceding and avoiding a tussle.

DnDGreentext,2sk6si,anothga,6,Fri Jan 16 00:52:23 2015 UTC,I really want to know the players reaction to his murder. Excellent story! Very eager to read more!
DnDGreentext,2sk6si,eldonkr,12,Fri Jan 16 05:47:46 2015 UTC,"I touched on it in my new thread, but I'll elaborate more if you're still curious.  One thing you have to know is we play by skype and roll20, which makes it a LOT easier to do private communication between players or players and the DM without a lot of obvious note-passing.  So all the DM really knew about was when I made a private check with him to see if I was overhearing the druid talk with the Shieldmaidens.  The Fae's player I just told I was having trust issues and I really didn't think we should let him take last watch and I wanted her opinion.  The ninja I was very up-front with ""I think we might have to kill him, but I want your assessment.""  So, after we had the conversation where he said ""wait until we get to town,"" was when I made my final decision on it that yes, my character was going to kill his, and the ninja was in total agreement.  The fae's player agreed that yeah he was obviously going to turn us in, but we didn't loop her in on what we were doing.  We also didn't loop in the DM.  He was as surprised as the druid was when, as soon as we hit second watch(which the Ninja was taking) I said ""Okay it's time.""  and the ninja said something to the effect of ""I'm going to sneak up to where the druid is sleeping.""  The Druid's player, you could tell, was surprised, but he was laughing while he was calling us sons of bitches.  He completely understood why our characters would do what they were doing, and never denied his character was going to turn us in(he's kind of an odd guy, but he's cool).  He rolled up a new character and there's never been any hostility IC or OOC between us since."

DnDGreentext,2sj56l,DerpxDerpxDerp,43,Thu Jan 15 17:13:11 2015 UTC,That's bullshit you get xp for succeeding an encounter not killing things.
DnDGreentext,2sj56l,Thenre,26,Thu Jan 15 18:19:47 2015 UTC,He is new to DMing as I am new to playing. I should bring that up. As of now I still have 0xp
DnDGreentext,2sj56l,Thenre,19,Thu Jan 15 18:35:18 2015 UTC,"Yea, everyone involved in encounter gets xp. If the goat got solo xp he would be an insanely high level. Also I doubt a god would have died from that but expect no xp anyways."
DnDGreentext,2sj56l,Thenre,11,Thu Jan 15 18:37:28 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity what kind of experience would I be looking at while splitting it between me, and one giant goat"
DnDGreentext,2sj56l,sirblastalot,6,Thu Jan 15 18:50:29 2015 UTC,"For killing a literal god? I dunno since it's a metric asston of challenge rating above you and it would normally be worth a bunch. If I was DM and the player was arguing for xp I would just give him level 4 or 5 and not do the math. It's probably about that, maybe more. XP doesn't really get ""split"" but it does get reduced based on relative difficulty (is more people is easier so less xp) there are rules for all that in the books.  I don't know them offhand because I typically just reward xp at the end of every session based on storyline progress, side quests, difficulty of session, quality of role playing, and the tempo I want for the game."
DnDGreentext,2sj56l,Thenre,7,Thu Jan 15 19:20:31 2015 UTC,"In 3.5 at least, there's literally no rules for experience rewards for encounters whose challenge rating is far enough from your level."

A 1 on a performance check doesn't mean that you accidentally should drink the potion you are trying to sell. that's like saying 5% of the time you are packing a sandwich for lunch in the morning, you accidentally eat it instead of putting it in a bag.  also, a god died from having a giant goat crush him? that's a pretty lousy god."

It is not the responsibility of the other players to CONVINCE you to join their party, it is your responsibility to make a character that wants to work with the party.  Even when I am playing an evil character joining a good party, I give him solid motivations to WANT to work with them and often they get along better with him than with some of the good or neutral characters.  When a special snowflake wants their character to be ""persuaded"" to join the group, I usually have my character say ""fine, go your own way then,"" and then he can either play on his own or roll up a new character.  That said, these players sounded like dicks and I think in this case, your TPK was completely justified."

DnDGreentext,2s6sr2,jzieg,3,Wed Jan 14 05:27:12 2015 UTC,"But you retain your own health, so you basically want to boost wis and con to the max, as well as int when you can afford it so you can start getting points in knowledge skills like the planes, arcana, dungoneering and religion, besides concentration, handle animal and knowledge nature which will be your primary point dumps. Reason beeing that you need these skills to unlock the full potential of the Shapechange spell you get later on."
DnDGreentext,2s6sr2,SinisterSintram,2,Thu Jan 15 03:04:30 2015 UTC,"The point is that your con is replaced with ws, thus upping your hp."
DnDGreentext,2s6sr2,herpy_McDerpster,2,Sat Jan 31 07:47:20 2015 UTC,"Nope. It's a a bit of a mess with Wildshape/Shapechange/Polymorph/Shapeshift and all their differences and nuances but one thing they all have in common is that you retain your own hitpoints.   The relevant rules. Wildshape itself says nothing about con or hp but: ""This ability functions like the alternate form special ability, except as noted here.""  Alternate form has this to say: ""The creature gains the physical ability scores (Str, Dex, Con) of its new form. It retains the mental ability scores (Int, Wis, Cha) of its original form. Apply any changed physical ability score modifiers in all appropriate areas with one exception: the creature retains the hit points of its original form despite any change to its Constitution."""

DnDGreentext,2s3ct0,beetnemesis,8,Mon Jan 12 03:07:24 2015 UTC,That's basically the whole story. The storyline was that we were airship guards and the airship was attacked by a test run of the black waltzes. Everyone died but us yadda yadda we end up basically right ahead of or right behind the main cast of the game and dealing with their messes or the set up. Was a lot of fun but that was the only real memorable moment.
DnDGreentext,2s3ct0,namesaremptynoise,10,Mon Jan 12 03:26:23 2015 UTC,How did you manage to cheat rolling five 20s in a row?
DnDGreentext,2s3ct0,ShinyJoltik,17,Sun Jan 11 21:28:21 2015 UTC,We used to fuck around with dice A LOT. I had a set of weighted counters for MTG life totals and used one of those with a pencil stop to get it. You just know which number needs to be on top when you throw and to not super over throw it.   The last one was real though ( they made me switch dice) then I rolled a 18 or some shit.

DnDGreentext,2rxlsp,TorHKU,33,Sat Jan 10 06:56:26 2015 UTC,"I don't get the Mary Sue reference, but that game sounds awesome. I've played games where I knew I would never get my character killed and it took the fun out of it. Some were just good character builds, but some of my DnD buddies like to make people happy.  One guy just likes the narrative of it. As long as he gets to tell a story, he's happy. Another one loves to give us gold and magical equipment until we are seriously overpowered, then find a way to take it all away. I usually have a few plot paths players can follow, but have an open themed world. A few encounters that cater to players and/or their character's class. A few encounters that shape how my world grows based on players' choices.  My buddy was mad at me for spending a half hour talking to his wife, going into detail about some clothes she had custom-tailored in game. I had to pull him aside and be like, ""WTF man, your wife is enjoying a hobby you have. Let her have her moment now, and she may become a valuable player.""  And to follow up... no, she didn't. He was an ass-hat and pissed her off. She tore up her character sheet and left bc he was shitty to her and embarrassed her. Party wiped without her. BBEG Necro raised their corpses so he didn't have to carry all their expensive gear, sold it all and then sold them to a fleshknitter as golem-parts.   Dude's wife laughed her ass off. Rest of party had a good laugh too."
DnDGreentext,2rxlsp,Th3DragonR3born,30,Sat Jan 10 09:17:48 2015 UTC,A Mary Sue is any fictional character designed primarily as a form of wish fulfillment on the part of the author. More details available through the Mary Sue Litmus Test.

I'd gladly GM for a bunch of complete and utter newcomers who have no idea about RPGing than have a That Guy in my group ... again.
DnDGreentext,2rxlsp,UglierThanMoe,6,Sat Jan 10 11:26:30 2015 UTC,"I'm a part of a larger group that has a few stories about Those Guys that they've booted, and while I laughed at those stories and thought ""Man, that sounds like a challenge, gimme That Guy to fuck around with any day"", one of the recent games I ran for the group's newbies has two players who, while not quite being That Guy, are very... troublesome.  I was totally wrong, That Guy is not a challenge you willingly take on."
DnDGreentext,2rxlsp,E-Squid,9,Sun Jan 11 02:52:30 2015 UTC,"That Guy is not a challenge you willingly take on.   Agreed. It's fun to fuck with That Guy until he eventually leaves for good when either your party is large that it doesn't matter, or you've got replacement at hand. But when you're stuck with That Guy because he's a more or less vital member of the party due to its small size (had a That Guy in a 3-man party once; oh what joy), it's just annoying beyond belief."
DnDGreentext,2rxlsp,UglierThanMoe,6,Sun Jan 11 03:07:56 2015 UTC,"I haven't had a full-blown That Guy yet, but I have had a very difficult player in a party of three, and there are times when I wish I did have a replacement for him lined up. Hardly ever RPs or engages (this is an online game, which probably makes that infinitely easier for him) at all, even with prompts. Totally unhelpful with his character; at the beginning I asked him if he A) had anything he wanted out of the campaign, and B) had anything he wanted to do with his character, and he pretty much said ""I dunno"" while having managed to pick character traits that were the most labour-intensive for a GM.  Compared to the one-shot I have though, he's not bad. I'm running a somewhat-tactical game where the party (a fireteam of soldiers) is meant to be convincing the civilian inhabitants of a large bunker to leave, either by diplomacy or by force. Kind of like the Enclave in the original Fallouts, except with more of a desire for peaceful resolution. Two players, the team's commanding officer and the team's medic, seem to be more focused on bickering, bantering, and ""delivering sick burns"" to each other (which really aren't all that good) in addition to constantly making lewd passes at each others characters.  Fortunately, the other players seem to want to ignore that and focus on the mission, and everyone seems to be enjoying it anyway, so I suppose it's not that bad."
DnDGreentext,2rxlsp,E-Squid,3,Sun Jan 11 03:48:35 2015 UTC,"what can be even worse is being a player in a group with a ""That Guy"" and a new DM who doesn't know how to deal with a ""That Guy"". That is downright hell, it happened to me. That Guy could basically do whatever the fuck he wanted and the DM never stopped him because he didn't know how far was ""too far"". The only times he did tell That Guy no he would bitch and whine and then refuse to make his character help (or outright try to sabotage the rest of the group) so the DM became apprehensive of trying that. This shit ruined the group."
DnDGreentext,2rxlsp,nox1468,11,Tue Jan 13 03:44:19 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand why the GM invited this guy to her home. He seems to have made it pretty clear that he wasn't going to participate in her game in the manner the game was intended to be played. Even if she'd made the invitation first, there's nothing wrong with saying ""on second thought, given the way you're acting right now, I don't think you're going to fit the group after all."" The point where he declares that he's going to play the game just to make sure she runs it ""right"" is the point where he needs to be told that he can't play, to whatever degree of rudeness is required to make him understand that he's not invited."

DnDGreentext,2rlof4,mister_hotshine,22,Wed Jan 7 05:50:19 2015 UTC,Fuck..... This is exactly how I have my cleric planned in my head.....
DnDGreentext,2rlof4,XLBananaHamock,11,Wed Jan 7 14:35:10 2015 UTC,"I think the starter kit character was nature domain, but the player asked to change to war. Clerics are BA, dude. Do it up."
DnDGreentext,2rlof4,cain3482,8,Wed Jan 7 17:21:27 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how war clerics work. I am playing in the ""Hoard of the Dragon Queen"" as a Half-Elf war domain cleric. I am about to fight a half-dragon alone that is likely challenge rating 2 or 3, that also brutally knocked me unconscious at lvl 1.  I raise my armor to 20. Summon a floating gauntlet to attack with me. Accept her 1v1 challenge.   Hit with the mace and inflict wounds on first round (3d10) - 20 dmg.  She hits me with greatsword strike - 8 dmg, I am at 23.  Hit with gauntlet and mace attack second round - 12 dmg.  She misses one attack, other crits dealing 19 dmg, I am now at 4.  Hit with gauntlet, about to miss with inflict wounds on second round ... give my roll +10 - 23 dmg.  Half-Dragon suddenly becomes dishonorable when she realizes I will win (DM had it be a her), and calls her guards. Halfing monk jumps out from hiding behind our dwarf pally - double hits her with surprise/advantage. Deals the remaining two damage. A small puff of fumes comes from her mouth as she was about to use her breath weapon on us. God my cleric was good."
DnDGreentext,2rlof4,XLBananaHamock,3,Wed Jan 7 18:36:33 2015 UTC,I haven't seen the starter kit yet. I love playing clerics and bards and it'd about time they feel like an epic son of a bitch. I loved my cleric in 4e but it was still lackluster.... He was an elven bow cleric with laser beams of doom
DnDGreentext,2rlof4,wolfdreams01,22,Wed Jan 7 20:44:04 2015 UTC,That's an awesome way to start up.
DnDGreentext,2rlof4,wolfdreams01,9,Wed Jan 7 09:11:50 2015 UTC,"This should not have worked.  Most of what you're describing are concentration spells, so he shouldn't have been able to have more than one going at a time.  THAT's why he was overpowered"
DnDGreentext,2rjbni,rabbidbunnyz,56,Tue Jan 6 18:19:26 2015 UTC,If the DM ruled that his own monster was killed by a falling stalactite from a ricocheting copper piece... you didn't break anything.
DnDGreentext,2rjbni,Galemp,33,Tue Jan 6 18:45:38 2015 UTC,"Someone really needs to write a book on how to handle crits. Not saying it's wrong to have nat 20's being auto-kills. I mean, if your group enjoys that sort of thing then it's your game man, whatever.  But if you're doing an intricate plot or the group is somehow at a place they shouldn't be, then having them succeed in their action in a cool way is enough. Maybe it draws it's attention so that it releases your party members and gives them time to escape, or continue attacking like idjets.  Or just sparks wildly and drives it off temporarily.  It sounds like the GM either panicked and gave up because he is new/bad at lateral thinking around his scenario, or just didn't give a fuck. Maybe it was just a one-night one-shot."
DnDGreentext,2rjbni,Bannedfromfun,17,Tue Jan 6 20:17:32 2015 UTC,"Regular nat20 seems a bit common for auto-kills, but maybe a nat20 confirmed by another nat20: 0.25% chance."
DnDGreentext,2rjbni,BucketHelm,7,Tue Jan 6 21:09:50 2015 UTC,"My group usually goes with Nat 20 threatens a crit, Nat 20 on confirmation roll threatens instagib, third Nat 20 confirms instagib."
DnDGreentext,2rjbni,Gygaxfan,9,Tue Jan 6 23:25:33 2015 UTC,"My group does rising multipliers. Say you roll a 20 for a weapon with a X2 critical hit multiplier. Roll to confirm, get another 20. Now you get to make another confirmation roll, success means that your crit does X3 damage, failure keeps you at X2. In this case, you not only confirm, but roll another 20. Now your critical hit is confirmed for X3, but you get another confirmation roll with success indicating X4 damage. Keep following the pattern until you stop rolling 20s."
DnDGreentext,2rjbni,jzieg,7,Wed Jan 7 04:26:36 2015 UTC,"These are called exploding dice, because you can essentially crit on a crit confirmation check."
DnDGreentext,2rjbni,Paradigmist,4,Wed Jan 7 09:31:08 2015 UTC,Am I misunderstanding or is this a 1 in 400 chance just to get a X2? because that seems a little extreme.
DnDGreentext,2rjbni,DaftPrince,7,Wed Jan 7 06:52:57 2015 UTC,"You just have to make a normal success on the confirmation roll to get the normal multiplier. In case you don't know how crits work in 3.5 edition, look here. A better layout would also improve comprehension:  1) Roll a natural 20 on an attack roll. This counts as an automatic hit regardless of the target's armor class.  2) Roll to confirm the critical hit. Confirmation rolls are made after a critical threat is scored by rolling a 20 (or an 18-20 depending on what weapon is being used, some have a larger threat range). The confirmation roll must hit the target's armor class, otherwise damage is dealt as normal. If the confirmation roll fails, stop here and do normal damage. If the roll succeeds, stop here and do extra damage depending on the weapon's critical multiplier (usually X2, but can go as high as X4 depending on the weapon). If you roll ANOTHER 20 on the confirmation roll, go to step 3.  3) Make another confirmation roll. If this roll fails, stop here and do damage according to what you got for step 2. If the roll succeeds, add 1 to the weapon's critical multiplier, so a weapon that would normally do X2 damage on a crit does X3 damage on this hit. If you somehow roll another 20, proceed to step 4.  4) Keep repeating step 3 until you stop rolling 20s  So every time you roll a 20 on a confirmation roll, you get a bonus confirmation roll to increase the damage multiplier and 20s on the bonus confirmation roll can generate more bonus confirmation rolls. My group has yet to reach step 4 and I find it highly unlikely we ever will. I favor this method because it gives bonuses for rolling multiple 20s in a row without resulting in extreme plot derailment due to instant boss death by a level 1 fighter who just can't stop rolling 20s. The bosses should be able to take this kind of punishment because it's just one extra hit's worth of damage and it won't happen often enough to affect the overall course of your game.*  *Probably."
DnDGreentext,2rjbni,jzieg,6,Wed Jan 7 07:20:33 2015 UTC,"Oh cool, that actually makes a lot of sense. So it's kind of like being given an extra attack every time you roll a 20, only rather than rolling damage for it you just increase the multiplyer. I like it."
DnDGreentext,2rjbni,DaftPrince,7,Wed Jan 7 07:29:48 2015 UTC,yeah.  And Vorpal allows for instagib on a nat 20 on the confirmation
DnDGreentext,2rjbni,acolyte_to_jippity,8,Wed Jan 7 00:10:29 2015 UTC,How many times has someone confirmed the instagib if at all?
DnDGreentext,2rjbni,OddtheWise,4,Wed Jan 7 05:02:59 2015 UTC,"It's a 1 in 8000 chance, so probably not much.  Edit: Maths fixed. I'm a tit."
DnDGreentext,2rjbni,DaftPrince,4,Wed Jan 7 06:20:49 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it be a 1 in 8000 chance? 203 = 8000

They behave the same way in those games (ganking people, causing trouble, treating NPCs as ""not real people""). It's no fault of theirs. They just haven't learned yet.  Just don't give up DMing. It is always nice to have someone else run for you, but remember too that some DMs like to play as well, and having a second person willing (and able) to run a game is nice for a DM who needs a little break.

DnDGreentext,2qjcsv,SheeEttin,-20,Sun Dec 28 09:30:37 2014 UTC,"Kind of a shitty DM to just say that you heard your name being said. Did they tell you it was a female voice? Did they say it was even REMOTELY familiar?  If they just said, ""You hear someone approaching and they say your name,"" then they're a shitbag who deserves to be punched in the heart.  If you're planning something like that, as a DM, you need more description."
DnDGreentext,2qjcsv,Zagorath,15,Sat Dec 27 23:18:22 2014 UTC,"The player is welcome to query the DM. He acted in haste, and you know what happened."
DnDGreentext,2qjcsv,thedoopz,17,Sun Dec 28 04:27:48 2014 UTC,"No, I think /u/horseradish1 has a point. I mean, not all the ""they're a shitbag"" stuff, that's way over the line, but about how the DM really should have mentioned that the voice sounds familiar.  If it's someone the character knew and grew up with, you bet they're going to recognise the voice, and that recognition should come much faster than the character can actually turn around and stab them. It was a pretty poor DMing decision, though I wouldn't use it to make any larger points about the DM's general ability."
DnDGreentext,2qjcsv,jzieg,6,Sun Dec 28 07:20:49 2014 UTC,"But the Halfling was from the town, and it had already been stated that he drank at the pub regularly, wouldn't all the voices sound familiar?"
DnDGreentext,2qjcsv,Zagorath,5,Sun Dec 28 08:05:38 2014 UTC,"Not all of them would sound like your wife. Even after 3 years, he should be able to instantly recognize her voice before the stabbing started. The DM might have to be a bit more specific to keep the player from jumping into combat, but this situation was really unnecessary."
DnDGreentext,2qjcsv,horseradish1,4,Sun Dec 28 13:08:54 2014 UTC,Very good point.
DnDGreentext,2qjcsv,SimplyQuid,5,Sun Dec 28 08:32:34 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but nobody just has some random voice. He acted in haste because he wasn't given information which he should have been given."
DnDGreentext,2qjcsv,CrazyPlato,20,Sun Dec 28 10:01:31 2014 UTC,The player wanted to stab the approaching person. He rolled a nat 20. He stabbed the person.
DnDGreentext,2qjcsv,FrankReshman,5,Sat Dec 27 22:58:38 2014 UTC,"It means that the intended action (stabbing the anonymous person) happens, with embellishment. Usually, an embellished stabbing is a one-shot kill. Not the GM's fault the target wasn't someone the character actually wanted to hurt; that's something the character should have thought out."
DnDGreentext,2qjcsv,CrazyPlato,-5,Sun Dec 28 04:33:56 2014 UTC,"Except it IS the GM's fault.  ""You hear a voice and someone approaching you from behind"" paints a far different picture than ""You hear your wife's voice behind you and someone approaching you from behind"".  The fact that the GM willingly concealed the fact that the person approaching him was his wife was a dick move."
DnDGreentext,2qjcsv,FrankReshman,5,Sun Dec 28 16:37:25 2014 UTC,"That could be disclosing too much information, as a GM. I can think of scenarios where that would be OOC information. He's been away from home for a long time, and perhaps he's forgotten what his wife's voice sounded like. Perhaps the background noise in the room makes it difficult to recognize a single voice, and he only noticed that his name was used. Perhaps he's just too amped up looking for enemies to be looking for a voice of a friendly face.   Imagine if you used the logic in another scenario. ""you notice a shadow in the corner of the room moving closer to you."" Some players would assume it's an enemy following, and some might think it's someone else and want to know more. But if you just say ""you notice the shadow of your best friend, moving eagerly toward you to say hi"", or ""you notice a shadow moving closer, and you see it's hand reach into a pocket and pull out a dagger"", you've killed the suspense of the moment. The player had a number of choices to make in that action, which would have yielded a number of entertaining outcomes, and by giving all of this specific detail, you've reduced that player to maybe two or three real options. If you look at it that way, that's actually railroading. Sometimes vagueness is a useful tool in an adventure."

A: Two dwarves picked up a copper piece at the same time!  An elf, a human and a dwarf are all enjoying drinks in a tavern when each notices a fly in their glass. The elf places his napkin over the glass and pushes it off to the side. The human removes the fly and keeps drinking. The dwarf pulls out the fly and starts yelling, ""Spit it out, ya bastard! Spit it out!""  A dwarf and an elf step into a restaurant and sit at the table. The waitress asks if she could take their order.  The Dwarf says. ""I'll take a 24oz steak. Rare. With a bottle of Dragonfire.""  The Waitress responds, ""And what about the vegetable?""  The Dwarf looks at the elf and growls, ""He'll take the steak too, and HE'LL LIKE IT!""  An ugly man walks into the cleric's office and says: ""Healer, I hurt all over.""  And the doctor says, ""That's impossible .  ""No really!"" he said, ""Just look, when I touch my arm, ouch! It hurts. When I touch my leg, ouch!, it hurts. When I touch my head, ouch!, it hurts. When I touch my chest, ouch!!, it really hurts"", he replies.  The cleric just shakes his head and says, ""You're a half-orc aren't you?""  The man smiles and says ""Yeah. But how do you know?""  The cleric replies, ""Because, your finger is broken.""  An elven wizard walks into a component shop and asks the merchant for a nice, ripe pound of brains. ""I have 3 different kinds,"" the merchant says. ""Human, Dwarf and Orc."" ""How much for the human?"" the elf asks. ""8 gold."" replies the merchant. ""Ah. Not bad,"" says the elf. ""Dwarf may be a bit cheaper, eh?"" ""Aye,"" says the merchant. ""6 gold."" ""Hmm.. nice. How about the orc brains?"" ""600 platinum,"" says the merchant. ""600 platinum!!"" exclaims the wizard. ""Why in the hell are orc brains so expensive?!"" To which the merchant replies ""Do you know how many orcs I have to kill to get a pound of brains?!!!  What do you call an ork who hasn't bathed in 2 years?  The cleanest ork in the world.

I'm just not sure how i'm going to enforce that..."
DnDGreentext,2o99zp,Zagorath,12,Sun Dec 7 17:43:49 2014 UTC,"I thought about this.  I have an idea.  It might be cruel, but it's interesting.  Schedule an hour or so with each player, at their house, to go over their character sheets.  But when you actually show up, tell them they have thirty minutes to pack.  Sit there looking over their sheet and occasionally asking questions while they frantically run around digging through their stuff and downloading information.  At the end of the half-hour, whatever they are carrying on their person is what they bring.  Then swear them to secrecy, so you can pull the same sadistic trick on other party members.  The disadvantage is that they can't bring anything unless they already own it or can very easily obtain it.  But that's also the advantage.  It reinforces the theme of ""ordinary people, with little warning, thrown into this situation"".  As opposed to, say, doomsday preppers.  There are other ways to do this.  Others have mentioned point buy etc., and I think that works, but I'm in favor of surprising players and seeing how they adapt whenever possible.  I do think that you should try to limit metagaming a bit by not letting them confer with each other on what their character will be and carry."
DnDGreentext,2o99zp,theserial,2,Thu Dec 11 18:03:43 2014 UTC,"How would you have them select their class? When they first enter through the portal, are they already level 1 (and thus already have some of the basic abilities of that class?), and if not, what are they capable of, and how do they get from there to choosing a class?

DnDGreentext,2o99zp,TheOneWhoSeeks,4,Tue Dec 9 22:14:07 2014 UTC,"So how I've planned this out would involve basically starting them as level ""0"" commoners.  From there they would interact in the starting town for a bit, before the hook drags them on a small, not at all dangerous, quest.  They would be accompanied by a small group from the village (representing the classes that they would want to be), where they would make connections and then have a short training montage on returning to the city.    Changes in stats (going from a commoner to a PC class) can probably be explained as their body adjusting to the different universe to keep IC.    What I have for the hook so far would be a meteor (or something else) falling somewhere outside the city (maybe a few days travel away).  Because a meteorite/other extraterrestrial object could be fairly significant, it should be reasonable for representatives of the various guilds/churches/other ""power"" groups to all want to check it out, and make sure that if it's valuable it serves their best interests.  It could always just end up being nothing, but the journey and connections would be the most important thing for the PCs."

As for the class of each character, have my own premade character classes at home ready, and on the first day of game, have them each come in as a level 0 human, and roll a d20 (or higher depending on how many i've fleshed out) and repeat any duplicate rolls so no same classes) and have them discover their own classes by their own proficiencies."

You have a laptop with a long battery and a hard drive full of multimedia, but your pistol is a mostly-plastic Chinese knockoff.""  Not to have it too complicated, of course. Regardless of roll quality, a pistol weighs X kg, a book Y kg, etc. And maybe roll a d10 for equipment quality instead of a d20. Or, also alternatively, have it be something you essentially have to spend skill points on. I'm spitballing here, but it keeps things fun and quick, instead of muddling things down with overmanaging or players trying to bring bullshit items."

I had them roll their characters up as peasants and added a bonus ""Terran"" trait that made up for having a real education and so on.  To start their character levels, they needed someone to apprentice them to some degree.  It was worse for characters with an ""inherent"" ability like sorcerer or psion, as they'd randomly fire off a level 0/1 spell/power when stressed like our sorcerer that kept firing off ray of ice at inopportune times or the telekinetic who's farhand would manifest and then not go away.  Once they had their training (Again, at Aeyllin), things progressed as you'd expect.

The Terran feat had some bonus to magic/power and a small skill bonus to what I called ""meta"" which was a general idea of the setting since the world seemed to be a standard pnp style fantasy world, at least on the surface.  So they knew things the average npc wouldn't.     Finally, come back to tg. We have no good writefags left, just edgy weebs.   I never left, I just don't post often.

DnDGreentext,2o99zp,Raile_Shia,1 point,Thu Dec 18 08:09:33 2014 UTC,"I was constantly reminded of K.A. Applegate's Everworld series, about teenagers sucked into the world of the Gods.  Aimed at the younger young adult demographic, but I enjoyed reading them when I was that age... like a decade ago..."
DnDGreentext,2o99zp,Zagorath,5,Sun Dec 21 12:53:01 2014 UTC,"So I've just finished. Wow, that story was absolutely fucking amazing.  But still…I can't help but feel disappointed in the ending. We never got an explanation for   why this group was chosen what was going on with the spymaster how Avery came back (perhaps the biggest problem I had) why Avery lost her powers briefly, and why she glowed blue after getting them back   Any one of those missing might have been okay, but missing all those pretty significant plot points left the ending feeling…empty.  Would have also liked explanations for a few other things, but they're definitely not necessary with the structure of the story and the timeskip to the last entry. It would have been nice if there had been a few more entries after the timeskip to explain some more things, but it was still great how it was. Some of these points are really minor side interests of mine   what ended up happening with the religion — did Avery get people back on track? Did other clerics and paladins start getting stronger powers again? Did the journal writer get his body revived? It doesn't quite sit right with me that head be permanently in his dream form. Did they find rubber, or something else to use for tyres? What happened politically with Wolflake? I'd really like to think that they sorted out some peaceful solution that makes everyone happy. How's New Chicago going? Apparently the desert was caused by some evil… Did they ever defeat that evil, or at least try?     But seriously, as much as the end felt a little lacking, the story was still absolutely incredible. I think this is my new favourite DnD-based story.  Also my current character is a Psion with the Dreamwalker paragon path. So this story felt really extra fucking awesome for me."
DnDGreentext,2o99zp,Raile_Shia,6,Mon Dec 8 01:06:07 2014 UTC,"The how the groups are chosen thing, i think, is left deliberately unexplained. I believe that stuff is up to the reader to speculate on.  IIRC, the spymaster was just a very strong construct (formerly elf) with dimension hopping abilities that just teleported away and reformed upon taking severe damage that was hired to kill the narrator by that noble family(Reinhardt?) in Wolflake. The nobles get killed, but the construct is bound by its task until it completes it or gets killed.  The way i choose to look at Avery is, the gods in the setting hadn't had a true believer in a while. Avery came, and she was a true believer, so she got some super juice going on for her. She lost her powers due to evil powers, but then regained them extra strong, which is why they're blue. When she ""died"", she ascended into an incorporeal form, which our hero Narrator is able to interact with because he is incorporeal himself.  As for the Sun Church itself, Avery did get a good start on reforming it on Aeylin, and i choose to believe that the reforming went on swimmingly after the corrupt head of the church was chopped off after the final events in the story.  The rubber thing is indeed left unanswered, but they did say they'd get around to it eventually.  I don't think that it was his dream form, though. I believe he was a Telepath/Psion Uncarnate. Incidentally, this also answers the question about him getting his body back. The answer is, no, but he got something better in return, so he got that going for him, which is nice.  New Chicago is a thriving metropolis. In Journal Entry 324 we see the Narrator snapping pictures of it developing, and in the final entry we see they're going there by train.  I don't think the desert was caused by some evil. At least not some OTHER evil. I believe the desert was intentionally created to separate the technological metropolis of New Paris from the rest of the world and make access to it very difficult, except via invisible airship, so they could have their Utopia far away from the uncivilized world."
DnDGreentext,2o99zp,beetnemesis,3,Mon Dec 8 02:46:57 2014 UTC,"The how the groups are chosen thing, i think, is left deliberately unexplained. I believe that stuff is up to the reader to speculate on.   Fair enough, I guess.   The nobles get killed, but the construct is bound by its task until it completes it or gets killed.   Ah right, thanks. I didn't realise it wasn't operating of its own free will.   the gods in the setting hadn't had a true believer in a while. Avery came, and she was a true believer, so she got some super juice going on for her   Wow, yeah, I really like this interpretation.   When she ""died"", she ascended into an incorporeal form, which our hero Narrator is able to interact with because he is incorporeal himself   Presumably the narrator can still interact with others, yes? But according to your interpretation, it seems that Avery wouldn't be able to. Kinda disappointing, and rather confusing, considering that we as readers can see the writing she left in the diary. So I'm not sure I agree with that bit.   I don't think that it was his dream form, though. I believe he was a Telepath /Psion Uncarnate   So, I find the text on the srd page really hard to read, but from what I can gather from that, and definitely in the 4e PHB 3, it seems that Uncarnates turn their own body into an incorporeal form, they don't separate a physical form and an incorporeal one, which is what the narrator did (as indicated, chiefly, by the time his body was stabbed while he was incorporeal).  It doesn't exactly match the 4e ""Dreamwalker"" paragon path, either, because a Dreamwalker is equally conscious of their dream form and their physical body, while the narrator seemed to become unaware of his physical body while incorporeal. Still, to me, this seems to fit the evidence better.   in the final entry we see they're going there by train   oh shoot, I missed that bit. Thought it said New Paris. Cheers.   I believe the desert was intentionally created to separate the technological metropolis of New Paris from the rest of the world    Correct me if I'm wrong, but I was under the impression that the story said that the people who ended up founding New Paris did so after going into the desert to see what evil had caused it.    As a side note, rereading entry 355 to verify that last point, I saw this bit again ""This group's ambition was to make each kingdom self sufficient to end the wars"". What I thought was absolutely fantastic was how the narrator's group of Terrans seemed to do the exact opposite. They pushed different groups to work together more, and that seems to have done the job of creating peace. A really nice message."
DnDGreentext,2o99zp,pieisablessing2me,5,Mon Dec 8 16:44:50 2014 UTC,"About the Uncarnate - When they reach 10th level, they completely abandon their physical forms. They can still turn corporeal for 1 min a day, but otherwise they're incorporeal full time. But they can still interact with physical objects.  The author seems to have toyed around with the concept a bit, but i think it's too close of a match to discard. For instance, we see that at first he was unable to pick up even the lightest of objects. Later on, we see him in Raina's kitchen nonchalantly cooking while incorporeal while everyone else is spooked the hell out by it. Finally, when he ""dies"", he completely sheds his body in favor of his incorporeal form.  What happened to Avery is no doubt the BIGGEST question mark left by the author. The cryptic messages she leaves him after her supposed death (how could she still interact with the physical world?)... I can only assume she indeed ascended, though the Narrator is still capable of interacting with her.  Or maybe, she has come back, sent down by the gods to continue her work. I mean, they DID find out ressurrection was possible in this world, so no reason she couldn't."
DnDGreentext,2o99zp,TunkaTun,2,Mon Dec 8 16:56:11 2014 UTC,"Hmm fair enough, I guess that does make sense. It definitely makes me feel a lot more at ease with what happened to the narrator at the end.  Gotta say, though, from a realistic standpoint, it never made sense to me that he would go and light the thing himself. Why wouldn't he just use his incorporeal form to do it while being on the ship himself? Ah well.  Thanks for all the explanations!"
DnDGreentext,2o99zp,KingOfThePimps,3,Mon Dec 8 17:51:05 2014 UTC,"LOL I THOUGHT THE SAME THING WHEN I READ IT.  For me, this was the biggest 'hollywood dumb' moment of the entire thing, entirely meant to create tension and drama.  If i were to nitpick there's other things, too. Over on r/gametales someone pointed out that, although the Narrator mourns and feels strongly about the death of Amanda, he doesn't seem to mind at all about the death of Dan, another of the terrans. Which is very odd, because seemingly the only reason he mourns Amanda is because she's terran, which Dan also is.  Furthermore, he goes so far as to try and appease her spirit in order for her to find her final rest, but this is after they learn about the possibility of ressurrection on this world. Which is even odder, given that they were knee-deep in church politics by that point and even had access to a higher-ish level Cleric, who could no doubt find out about ressurrection, and that would have made a neat sidequest.  Another thing, is that the story has a lot of dropped plot points. Max, for instance, is touted to be some next-level kind of Mage, but he doesn't do anything of note other than blast some spells around... Just like Alex was already doing before Max even started Wizard school.  Ian is only casually mentioned throughout the whole story, and by the end of it, we can't even positively define what exactly he ended up turning into.  So yeah, there's a LOT of room for improvement, definitely. What i would REALLY like to see, is the author polishing up this story, taking it to an editor and turning it into a full fledged book. One thing that would really benefit this story a lot would be to have some more viewpoints other than just the Narrator. Something like Game of Thrones, where each chapter is a different character and a different viewpoint."
DnDGreentext,2o99zp,totes_meta_bot,7,Mon Dec 8 20:08:31 2014 UTC,"The reason he mourns Amanda is because he feels responsible. In his entry before they console her spirit, he says he psy-probed into the crate and may have accidentally awakened what was in there. It went on to crash the ship and start the whole Barbarian chase, which got her killed."
DnDGreentext,2o99zp,blarg_dino,2,Fri Dec 19 02:23:42 2014 UTC,"Definitely agree I'd like to see it polished up and made into a proper book.  The ASoIaF format would definitely work well, but I also kinda like the limited viewpoint. I thought this extract kinda flirted with the idea of an unreliable narrator in a really good way (like the dragon thing that I mentioned in the gametales thread), though it's a technique that works best when it's fully committed to it. Either way, really, if it had a higher ""production value"" (for lack of a better term) it'd be absolutely fantastic."

DnDGreentext,2o99zp,_SnesGuy,3,Mon Dec 8 21:29:14 2014 UTC,"why this group was chosen   It was random   what was going on with the spymaster   He was the equivalent of a magic cyborg.  I had a scene planned out that I never got to, about finding a lab full of them in New Paris.  He was someone that had most of his bones and organs augmented by implanted enchantments.  He was sold to the Reingrafs during one of their attempts at opening trade with New Paris.  His final ""programming"" was to kill whoever had killed him initially and he was stuck in a loop of teleporting, getting killed and teleporting back to his regen chamber.  The Reingrafs were in no position to fix the situation at the time since they were being converted into undead horrors with the rest of the Wolflake nobility.     how Avery came back (perhaps the biggest problem I had)   Avery came back as something not human.  Her god had ascended her to some sort of celestial.  I never decided what kind.   why Avery lost her powers briefly, and why she glowed blue after getting them back   The lich cut Avery off from her god.  When she started glowing blue, she was drawing from her own belief and force of will.  When the lich was killed, she regained her connection, though it was a bit late.     what ended up happening with the religion — did Avery get people back on track? Did other clerics and paladins start getting stronger powers again?   Avery inspired a resurgence.  True believers were far stronger than the fakers.   Did the journal writer get his body revived? It doesn't quite sit right with me that head be permanently in his dream form.   He became an Uncarnate.  He could probably find a way to circumvent the corporeal time limitation eventually.     Did they find rubber, or something else to use for tyres?   Yes, on one of the other continents that are only on my GM only map   What happened politically with Wolflake? I'd really like to think that they sorted out some peaceful solution that makes everyone happy.   Wolflake was a complete mess at the end of the war.  The nobles were dead, the king was dead, most of the population was dead.  The refugees of New Paris would eventually settle there and start a new life with the neighboring orcs.   How's New Chicago going?   Good question.  What would a kobold city look like anyways?   Apparently the desert was caused by some evil… Did they ever defeat that evil, or at least try?   The great evil (which was an evil demigod) that made the desert was dealt with long ago by a previous Terran group and the ancestors of the New Paris elves.  Prior, the area was a vast plains area.  Purifying the region would take a tremendous effort and at the moment, it's not really necessary."

DnDGreentext,2mn4df,jurofeg,14,Tue Nov 18 16:57:39 2014 UTC,"OP mentioned 3 20s. The chance of rolling any specific permutation of three D20s is 1/8000, or 0.0125%. Yes, that's extremely low, but let's be realistic, the amount of people playing DnD, it's bound to come up from time to time.  Given that, it's also bound to at least sometimes happen when the group in question is doing awesome things, worthy of a story."
DnDGreentext,2mn4df,Zagorath,3,Tue Nov 18 18:30:54 2014 UTC,"I realize this is a very late reply, but to prove your statistical point, I've been playing for coming up on 33 years now and once I had a player (I'm the DM) roll four nat 20s in a row on me! This was consecutive and in the same encounter.  Closest I've seen otherwise in all that time was two in a row."
DnDGreentext,2mn4df,TheOneAndOnlyLump,3,Fri Dec 26 06:51:57 2014 UTC,"I rolled 3 natural 20s in a row in an encounter with a Kraken. I was a lvl 20-something Wartroll named Tussle with a +5 Vorpal katana.  The DM never managed to kill that character. Not even close. Monk/Kensai/Legendary Dreadnought. Sad part was, his favored weapons were his hands and fist. DM allowed me to enchant them as +2, Brilliant Energy, and twice (2 enchants) as Vicious (+2d6 each). Took some grappling feats. Regen/fast heal feats. Spellcasting Harrier. Found that badass katana, ended up being BBEG's ancient evil sentient artifact. Battle starts. He summons his sword and thanks me for retrieving it for him, I grapple him and tear him to pieces over 10 rounds as my party just watches. I sheath the katana and never draw it again.  I loved playing him. He was made by a cruel mage that used him to torture people, and when he had tortured and killed all his people, he turned on Tussle. Being under the effects of a magical slave collar, he had no choice but to do evils and take the torture dealt to him by his creator. Creator goes mad from a failed experiment that backfired, orders Tussle to kill everyone in the throne room. Chants it, screams it til foam and spittle fly out of his mouth. In the end, Tussle has no choice but to kill the mage, the only one left alive in the throne room. Murders his master to his master's own plea of ""Kill them! Kill everyone"", and gains his freedom. He has always hated magic users and has hunted magi since his liberation."

DnDGreentext,2mn4df,Angam23,1 point,Tue Nov 18 17:02:59 2014 UTC,They were still assholes.  If you're going to pull shit like that in a campaign there is absolutely no reason not to give the DM a heads up before the campaign ever even starts. It ensures that they don't waste a bunch of their own time coming up with a plan for you that you don't intend to even try to follow and can even give them the opportunity to prepare material that will enhance whatever you're trying to do.  This is especially true if you're playing with a brand new DM.

DnDGreentext,2lc510,blotto5,50,Wed Nov 5 19:51:38 2014 UTC,"Remember your conversational skills and use them to your full advantage. This post is a prime example of what you can do with them.  Make use magic device a priority. Once you get it high enough, start packing scrolls and wands. Rogues are hard enough to keep out of your house when they don't have wands of silence, invisibility, mage hand, etc. For this and the above reasons, don't forget about charisma when distributing your stats.  Instead of spending all your time disabling traps, consider making a few of your own. A simple tripwire attached to some bells helps with keeping watch at night. Bear traps are portable, cheap, and easy to set in a variety of environments. Tie some tripwire to the trigger of a crossbow pointed at whatever entrance needs protecting for an easy-to-assemble arrow trap*. Attach a vial of acid upside-down to the doorframe with the cork tied to the door for a more lethal version of the water bucket prank. I recommend packing at least three of each in your bag of holding. The possibilities are endless!  *As an extra note, because you won't be firing the crossbow by hand, you might be able to get away with using a large sized or bigger crossbow for more damage without worrying about oversized weapon penalties. Just don't make it so big you can't hide or carry it."

DnDGreentext,2l6m1f,momomo544,3,Tue Nov 4 07:11:37 2014 UTC,"That's a bit tricky to be honest. Either you come in from the literary, video game, or rpg side.  Book wise Dan Abnett's Gaunt's Ghosts, Ravenor, and Eisenhorn series are all good an focus on the Guardsman and Inquisitor side of things. William King's spacewolf books are good for the marine side, and Sandy Mitchell's Ciaphas Cain series are the best lighthearted 40k fiction out there.  From the game side the Dawn of War series and Space Marine game are all fun. Space Marine is a hack and slash where you play a badass marine, Dawn of War and it's expansions are all RTS games which are well done but rather aged, and the DoW2 games are a sort of RTS hybrid here you only control a few hero units. They're all good games and have decent stories.  Finally you could just read the articles on 1d4chan and the stories archived on suptg (or ask this question on /tg/ proper) or jump into the sort of scholarly articles on the 4k wikia or lexicanum. I do recommend the stories on /tg/ and suptg though, they're quite amusing."

DnDGreentext,2j1tcq,Eyclonus,6,Mon Oct 13 06:11:57 2014 UTC,Are you using Dark Heresy or Only War for the Guardsmen? Or just por que no los dos?  Also how do you manage what seems to be a larger party than most RPGs do?
DnDGreentext,2j1tcq,TheCoach19584,13,Mon Oct 13 11:22:53 2014 UTC,"It's mostly DH, but I have to snag OW for things every once in a while.  Keeping the party moving smoothly is a bit of a challenge but it helps that everyone is a long time veteran and we use turn timers in combat. As for the NPC part members, I cheat a lot. Outside of combat I don't set up a challenge then roll their skills and all that, I either just have them pass what I think they should pass or roll against the failure chance I want. I also summarize a lot of the stuff they do for the PCs instead of trying to act it all out.  Balancing things out is harder though, 11 possible combatants can rip most things apart if it's a straight forward fight. I handle that by trying to find narrative reasons to split off the NPCs or set up encounters so that there's pressure to split forces into more normal sized units.  As a side note I'm STILL trying to balance the mines and detpacks, they keep solving every problem with them. And they're never EVER getting orbital strikes again. Put a lot of work into that slaanesh temple and they never even went inside..."
DnDGreentext,2j1tcq,TheCoach19584,4,Mon Oct 13 14:50:46 2014 UTC,"Out of curiosity, what did you have planned for the slaanesh temple? What was it going to look like if the party actually went into it?"
DnDGreentext,2j1tcq,serioush,6,Wed Oct 15 01:04:24 2014 UTC,"Well about half the place was just a bondage brothel filled with cultists that enjoyed pain and got variously boosted as they took damage. The deeper end had some seriously chaosy stuff centered around daemon summoning and daemon host creating as well as a sort of ‘illuminati’ control center. If they had gotten to the control center they would have found a big ol’ map of all the stuff this cult was controlling as well as an area that said ‘here be nurglites, hands off’. The place could either be destroyed by messing with its ancient reactor, or blowing open the giant water pipe running over the vault, or cutting a deal with the two restrained daemonhosts chilling there.

I just see all these amazing campaigns being posted about and I'd like to try to start one myself, as a player or a DM.  I think the main problem is that combat inevitably starts taking too long and gets a bit tedious. Some members are new to DnD still don't have the best grasp of the system (3.5) and rarely have their moves prepared. They often have trouble knowing what they have to roll. Any recommendations?"
DnDGreentext,2gywlw,metalsheep714,4,Mon Sep 22 23:12:11 2014 UTC,"I'm a fan of running a quick mechanic introduction for new players before I do a proper game.  Have them choose a generic character from template, run them through a few basic social/skill rolls, then basic combat, then item use, and finally a fight with some enemy that requires making saves. Keep the tone light and silly, play the tropes to the hilt, have a comically fatal or successful ending.   After a quick session like that you can get into setting a real game with plot and characters people care about with a lot less starting pains. I did this for every, single, new player. The overall game would pause, we'd all play the quick intro oneshot, then get back to the main session.   If possible reward your players for having their shit ready, and if they can take it punish them for taking too long. My games have had turn timers in combat for a long time now, you get longer if your int/agi/per is higher. If you don't decide in time your character repeats their last action. You might do this, or just give a +1 to people who go fast, or something else.  Not knowing what to roll can be a problem (especially in 3.5) I sort of played fast and loose with the rules and mashed stuff together at times (pickpocket and traps for instance). Don't be afraid to just say fuck it and give them a flat d20 check that has the failure rate you want. If there's a bunch of people together (whole party is sneaking maybe) I ocassionally just say okay thief is DC 8, ranger is 10, fighter is 13, wizard is 15, roll not to fuck up.  As a final note to end my rambling, Combat isn't the end all, a boss that gets beaten via a brilliant decision by a player can be far more satisfying than rolling for 40 minutes. The combat and the action rolls are there to lend uncertainty and danger to a story, which in turn is there to provide a setting and challenge to the characters. Plan your encounters, but remember the story is more important. Plan your story with branching forks, but don't get too attached to it because the characters are more important than the story. (also don't get hung up on NPCs, only flesh em out beyond basic unique traits after the players express interest)  Sorta long I guess, let me know if you want more."

DnDGreentext,2gywlw,serioush,6,Sun Sep 21 15:44:40 2014 UTC,"The system I'm currently using is called Dark Heresy, the first session was run using Only War.  Suggestion wise I got a few things I like to repeat. If you're going to be playing a warhammer 40k game you'll want to make sure everyone is into its lore, get them to read some people's stories or play Dawn of War or read some of the books by Dan Abnett or Sandy Mitchell. These systems are more for bringing 40k to reality than just being standalone systems.  I'm not sure I'd recommend going straight to the same exact type of game as we're running. I'm using NPCs to handle all the investigation and social stuff that's usually a major part of a DH mission. I'd recommend playing it straight and having your players act as actual investigators the first time, we're sort of running a parody of it here.  Finally I just gotta say that the best part of these games are the player interactions. The plot and the combat are sort of a backdrop for a story, they're the characters in it. Don't get super wrapped up in your own stories or NPCs, instead try to figure out ways that they can help the characters grow.  Not sure any of this helps at all, but good luck man."

He is considered the top ace of the war, being officially credited with 80 air combat victories.  Originally a cavalryman, Richthofen transferred to the Air Service in 1915, becoming one of the first members of Jasta 2 in 1916. He quickly distinguished himself as a fighter pilot, and during 1917 became leader of Jasta 11 and then the larger unit Jagdgeschwader 1 (better known as the ""Flying Circus""). By 1918, he was regarded as a national hero in Germany, and well-known amongst opposing forces.  Richthofen was shot down and killed near Amiens on 21 April 1918. There has been considerable discussion and debate regarding aspects of his career, especially the circumstances of his death. He remains perhaps the most widely known fighter pilot of all time, and has been the subject of many books, films and other media.

I can't remember the names of the class of undead or the metal he used, but the salient properties were as follows.   His character raises the temperature band of any location he's in by two. The metal used resists deformation due to pressure. He takes a Decanter of infinite water and sets it to null, then attaches it to a cone of pressure resistant metal with a miniscule opening on the small end. Then you attach this to a very large construct filled with all the PCs. By any imaginative means you have, get this construct into space. The temperature band raise from KoS makes this situation livable if you can manage to get air. At this point, turn the Decanter of Infinite Water up to full blast and point the cone at your target. I can't remember the velocity and capabilities of the Weapon, but it's extremely powerful. Congrats on your death satellite."

How thick was its armour and what kind of sloping did it have? What horsepower could the engine output, and what did the tank weigh? What kind of suspension did it use, and could it steer with a differential gear system or simply by using its brakes? How many road wheels did it have, and how large were they? Did you use an intercom system or just shout and kick each other a lot? What kind of facilities were available to the commander? Did he get a cupola, a mini turret, periscopes? What kind of sighting did the gunner have? Did the turret have a floor? How quickly could the turret rotate under power and under hand crank? What style of controls did the driver have?

Start working towards the Master Chymist prestige class and play it up before I even qualify. Goblin named Stitch, CE but needs people to help him acquire resources for his experiments. He goes by Cog-Maw and is a ""Gnome"". His mutagen form believes he is a LG Gnome, goes by Cog-Maw and is aware of his alternate personality but can't do much about it yet.  Start focusing on non-lethal takedown feats after realizing I can do over 100damage reliably at lvl 5 or some such due to some discussions about natural attacks and if they can be blunt damage.  We get a couple sessions in, kill a muck monster, nearly die, are intimidating the cartographer NPC we have hired for the job, go in a cavern and are taking out skeletons left and right with boulders before they can rise.  We get to the end of the caverns, Cog-Maw has roided out at this point, sees a skeleton samurai in armor on a chest a ways off. Picks up a giant boulder and walks nearby. Samurai steps up, starts monologuing and I cut him off as I move up to within 20' and hurl.  Crit, have huge str, like 4d6 sneak and it was a good sized rock. Samurai is below half hp and we destroy him.    Loot his body, take chest, head back to town. We try to sell chest at the local magic shop. Nice chest, inlaid gold, scrollwork, velvet padding. Pretty swanky. He offers like 20gp.  We head outside, companion starts talking up how sweet this chest is. I hold it up. I'm short, damn goblin. Oh wait, i have another mutagen. GET SWOLL! I now enlarge, buff out, and start displaying the chest like i'm a model on the price is right. Buddy keeps talking. Nails his Cha check. We start a bidding war. Chest is discussed as a good travel bed/hutch for small races like gnomes.   Wealthy gnome in the audience.    Make 500gp and get the shop owner to deal with us on better terms or we'll sell every damn thing we have in front of his shop and deprive him of business.  Plan was to find a shark and modify him with the vivisectionist Torturous Transformation and permanency to make him my were-shark minion named Nibbles and ride on his back like Master-Blaster, but I had to drop out of that game due to personal issues way before that.  Stitch is now an NPC merchant character I bring in to games as a master craftsman of terrible wares (not cursed, but not good). Axes of throwing that NEVER STOP, sphere of slope detection, bag of holding slightly more than normal and so on."

The ""wooden planks"" the elf was using to walk were his legs.  By the time they arrived in the little town, the Karthaki high was in full swing, and the PCs were tripping balls. This is just a theory, but I think the DM's use of the cocaine euphemism ""marching powder"" was intentional. The high makes everything seem to ""march"" in rhythm.  The following day, the PCs crashed hard, and the hallucinogenic drug had the opposite effect, turning everything into freaky horrors and inspiring them to write gibberish rhymes on the walls."

Party runs across petrified people on the way into town  Party told they were petrified by a Medusa, when she attacked them on the road.   Party finds Medusa's home. There are no petrified people around.   There are, however, letters.   Letters reveal the Medusa had been writing to a man from the town. She eventually revealed to him that she was a Medusa.   The two agreed to meet.   Party also finds a note explaining what had happened.   The man had arrived at her ruins at the same time as a party intending to kill her.  The man got to her first, but she accidentally petrified him.   The note also said she was leaving the ruins to find a way to cure him.   There was one more note. She had been attacked by bandits (possibly rapists) on the highway. A woman travelling alone is an easy target.   She managed to petrified some of them, but the others inflicted a mortal wound on her.   Knowing she was going to die, she travelled back to her home, wrote the last note, and crawled up around the petrified body of the man she loved to die.   The party travelled back to where they found the people on the road. They now know these people attacked her — an innocent woman just walking along the highway — and not, as they had claimed, the other way around.   The party proceeds to kill them.    Hope that helps."
