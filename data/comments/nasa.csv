I realize that you want to keep the video short and to the point, but I would definitely watch a longer version of this video (any duration is acceptable). However, I really think you should have included a few more shots of the moon, especially a shot featuring the lunar roving vehicle. Also, images like this one always give me the chills."

nasa,3e28bx,Gorebashy,20,Tue Jul 21 14:35:54 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't make a Moon base just to live there, it would obviously have to have some benefit which they mentioned in the article:   This Evolvable Lunar Architecture plan would also stir a new economy by mining the Moon for hydrogen in the polar water ice. The hydrogen would be processed and turned into cryogenic propellant, which would be stored in a propellant depot craft which orbits the Moon. That fuel would be sold to NASA or others looking for a way to fuel up for a trip to Mars. ""You basically expand free enterprise to the Moon,"" Miller says.   This would make trips to Mars much cheaper and easier since instead of having a massive spacecraft take off from Earth to go to Mars, a smaller one could which only needs enough room for fuel to reach that orbiting Moon refueling platform, and then enough to go from there to Mars. Therefore having a Moon base to get these resources would drastically reduce the price and complexity of a Mars mission."

nasa,3dvuc3,burtzev,9,Sun Jul 19 23:23:59 2015 UTC,"Pluto has a sphere of influence of about 3,100,000 km. The sphere of influence is the distance from a planet where you go from orbiting the sun to orbiting the planet. This article says the ionized gas is as far out as 68k miles which is about 110,000 km--only a fraction of the distance.  Is gas from the atmosphere actually being separated from Pluto and blown away or does the solar wind just push the very thin atmosphere around to the backside of the planet so it's very tear-drop shaped?  Does a gas particle at the very top of an atmosphere actually leave the planet? If I release helium on Earth, the atoms rise to the top of the atmosphere but they'd have to be moving at escape velocity to actually get out of the Earth's gravity well? Maybe this boils down to thermodynamics and average properties of a region of gas versus the range of energies particles actually have in them."
nasa,3dvuc3,kidfay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:28:43 2015 UTC,"Solar wind is a powerful thing when you have very light substance. All that 'atmosphere' of pluto is very thin, at that distance, so the solar wind hitting it has pretty much enough energy to transfer into the atoms of the atmosphere to help them achieve escape velocity.  Same goes for the gasses of our earth. The solar wind strips parts of our (any)atmosphere every second, only it's not that much.  I also don't know much about it and what I just said is my very basic understanding of it so I might be wrong. Or it might just be a bit more to it than what i said."
nasa,3dvuc3,PigletCNC,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:22:30 2015 UTC,"I really don't know about the strength of the solar wind in the vicinity of Pluto though I suspect your statement has some merit. As to helium (and other gases) the molecules don't have to have the energy implied in 'escape velocity' to gradually be lost from a planet's atmosphere. All that is required is the kinetic energy needed to move ""a little bit up"" from a gravitational source (the planet). Given time the molecules gradually drift, bit by bit, away from the planet. With each tiny step the energy required to make the next one becomes less and less. I presume this is what you imply in your last statement. Release any gas at ground level and at least 'some' of it diffuses upward, gravity or not."

When doing the ossi applications I would suggest not using the same little blurb when it asks for a short paragraph on why you are a good fit for the position. Personalizing it to each one would make you stand out and show that you are really interested in the position. Ossi normally opens in mid November and will start out with only some listings that you might be interested in, but over time a lot more get added.

I learned these during school, but knowing one language does make picking up another one easier. Though keep in mind I just finished my Junior year of college, so I've had time to get research during the year. It is completely possible to get in though in the first few years of undergraduate studies, I've seen quite a few interns who have. Also if you don't get in one year, you can always try again the next year. I didn't get in at first, but this year I was able to get a position. Good luck!

nasa,3df2jb,atcguy01,3,Wed Jul 15 19:58:45 2015 UTC,Couldn't it's orbit cause geological activity?
nasa,3df2jb,GuiltySparklez0343,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:03:20 2015 UTC,"Not really. Geological processes from orbiting are limited to tidal effects from a massive host being orbited. Pluto is much too far from the sun to undergo solar tidal effects, and Charon is too small/low mass to cause tides.  So for example several of Jupiters moon have active volcanoes and geysers and liquid seas of some kind. The heat driving these processes is thought to come from tidal flexing of the moons, as the moons rotate during their orbit around the planet, the moon presents a constantly changing face toward the planet. This rotation & the tidal force resulting from the large gravitational gradient of a massive neighbor, cause tidal heating which drives seismic activity"
nasa,3df2jb,scubascratch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:56:24 2015 UTC,So is weather covering up impact craters? Shouldn't the planet sublimate when it gets warmed up and then rain? Because Charon has impact craters and Pluto does not.
nasa,3df2jb,GuiltySparklez0343,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:27:18 2015 UTC,"I believe the implication is Pluto was spewing seismic dust as recently as 100 million years ago which covered and impact craters, and no large impacts since then.

nasa,3df2jb,Aegers86,4,Wed Jul 15 19:59:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Especially cuz of the implications for planet geology and habitability in the outer solar system. All these discoveries about internal heat, first tidal friction now this. It just makes the goldilocks zone look so quaint."
nasa,3df2jb,atcguy01,2,Wed Jul 15 20:04:30 2015 UTC,"The big point of the whole thing is how the inside of Pluto could have been heated.  The most common way (I believe) planetary bodies could have heated cores would be having outside tidal forces, such as from a moon, acting on them.  But Charon does not have enough mass to cause those forces.  So the heating appears to be caused by a method currently unknown to NASA.    So for me, (and I could be speaking out of my ass right now), I would be very interested to see how that could translate to heating Mars' core."
nasa,3df2jb,SpigotBlister,2,Wed Jul 15 20:04:28 2015 UTC,It could be a radiation from the core. Another theory that the team has presented is that Pluto actually has a liquid ocean beneath the surface that is slowly freezing over and releasing heat energy.

An antenna that broadcasts in all directions is called a omni-directional antenna (which is what we use to broadcast radio/tv stations).  New Horizons instead uses a directional antenna that focuses its radiation pattern into a beam (think of light radiating from a flashlight vs a lightbulb).    It directs its signal beam toward the sun (which is where the earth is).  It knows where the Sun is via a star map in its computer. This beam has a 1 degree angle and the spacecraft is currently ~31.88AU from Earth. At that distance, the antenna covers an area that is ~0.556 AU wide. The Earth is travelling around the Sun at 7.17×10-4 astronomical units per hour.   A good overview of New Horizons telecommunications abilities are available on Wikipedia  Also, check out the Deep Space Network Radio link page.  Currently it shows that New Horizons isn't transmitting anything to us (its antenna currently isn't pointed toward earth because its taking pictures of Pluto and Charon)."

Besides the low bandwidth, Pluto's distance also causes a latency of about 4.5 hours (one-way). The 70 m (230 ft) NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) dishes are used to relay commands once it is beyond Jupiter. The spacecraft uses dual redundant transmitters and receivers, and either right- or left-hand circular polarization.

nasa,3db7z7,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:51:56 2015 UTC,"If you look at pictures of New Horizons and similar space probes you will see that they all have a parabolic dish antenna. A signal directed into the dish from a feed at the focus of the parabola will be reflected in a very narrow beam towards the Earth. On Earth NASA has a network of radiotelescopes with a similar parabolic dish, only much larger, to receive the signals from New Horizons. There are sufficient receiving stations around the world to give 24-hour coverage. They also transmit commands to the probe.  Signals in both directions are transmitted at a slow rate with error-correcting codes embedded in the signal so that nothing is lost due to noise or a weak signal.  How does it know where to point the antenna? Earth's orbit is known very accurately, as is the course and position of the probe, so it is fairly simple for the probe's computer to calculate the position of Earth relative to the probe, and to turn the probe so that the antenna is pointing to where Earth will be when the signal arrives there."

The majority of people working at NASA are actually contractors; at JSC, for example, contractors outnumber civil servants 3:1.  Right now, the only clearcut path to becoming a civil servant is through the Pathways Intern Employment Program (aka co-op).  But they require a minimum of three work tours, the last of which must be completed before your senior year.  If you go to graduate school, it is possible to become a grad co-op, but it is extremely competitive.  My advice would be to start applying to NASA contractors now.  A common way to get your foot in the door is to take an internship after graduation; this allows you to build connections and improve your chances of landing a job with one of the many NASA contractors."

Yes, you need to go slowly to orbit it, but the planet has gravity that it uses to accelerate you, and that's actually the dominate effect: the bigger the planet, the more it speeds you up, and the more of that extra kinetic energy you need to shed to get into a stable circular orbit. (Also: no aerobraking!)  The main deal is that Pluto is really far away, so a gentle low-fuel orbit that grazes Pluto's orbit at a low relative velocity would take about 100 years to get there. So we fired a rapid probe to get there in 10 years instead, which means that it was too fast and we couldn't leave enough fuel behind to slow it down at the other end."

Still room to grow, absolutely, but definitely not poor by any measure.  I remember reading an article about New Horizons the day it launched (back in middle school). It was a tiny side banner on a site I was browsing. Now the day has come, and the internet is covered with Pluto everything. There are multiple AMAs with team members through different social networks, Google dedicated their homepage to the event...in fact, unless you're specifically avoiding the information I'd find it hard to not see it.  And that's what PR is about. More people are seeing it, and caring about it."
nasa,3d8wi5,localhost89,2,Tue Jul 14 16:56:50 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think this is more an issue of the lenses we look through at it from. Most people here, myself included, are die-hard space advocates, and one tendency that die-hards fall into is that we often think those that aren't as interested aren't interested at all.   The PR's fine in my opinion, and I don't think I could find many people that weren't interested at least to some degree with the work that NASA's doing; not everyone's going to check every update, read every scientific article, or watch every livestream of a launch, nor would that be indication of failing PR on NASA's end.

I am perhaps speaking from personal experience, having dealt with multiple people who take the ""What has NASA really done for us?"" stance.  While I commend NASA on its use of social media, I still feel that NASA is not always speaking on a level that most Americans can understand (and, more importantly, find entertaining). As such we have far too many people tuning out of these broadcasts, taking the stance that the news outlets in the Apollo 13 movie took: ""They said we made going to the Moon about as exciting as taking a trip to Pittsburgh.""  However, localhost89, I see your point and do feel that NASA's PR system isn't poor, but rather has room to improve.

The New horizons glitch was a mildly surprising, since they have been operating that spacecraft off and on for 9 years, and had a successful Jupiter flyby. Still, stuff like that can happen.  There is no way that the Dawn and New Horizons hiccups are in any way related, however. They're different designs being flown by different teams with different equipment on opposite coasts."
nasa,3ctpq9,Crimfants,3,Fri Jul 10 18:26:01 2015 UTC,"The New Horizons press release stated ""The investigation into the anomaly that caused New Horizons to enter safe mode on July 4 has confirmed that the main computer was overloaded due to a timing conflict in the spacecraft command sequence. The computer was tasked with receiving a large command load at the same time it was engaged in compressing previous science data. The main computer responded precisely as it was programmed to do, by entering safe mode and switching to the backup computer.""  The Dawn press release stated ""On June 30, shortly after turning on its ion engine to begin the gradual spiral down to the next mapping orbit, its protective software detected the anomaly. Dawn responded as designed by stopping all activities (including thrusting), reconfiguring its systems to safe mode and transmitting a radio signal to request further instructions. On July 1 and 2, engineers made configuration changes needed to return the spacecraft to its normal operating mode. The spacecraft is out of safe mode, using the main antenna to communicate with Earth.""  The events were days apart and the safe modes happened for completely unrelated and different reasons."

nasa,3cixwd,straighttoplaid,-7,Wed Jul 8 17:16:41 2015 UTC,"There are two options: either it's bullshit or physics as we know it is incorrect. You have to decide whether to trust the last 500 years of modern physics or two recent experiments. That's really the fundamental issue.  The details are a bit harder to describe. Basically, this breaks Newton's laws of motion by applying a force without an equal and opposite counterforce. It's flying a rocket without fuel. It's skating without pushing against the ice. It's flying a plane without a propeller. The experiments performed so far show a very very tiny force in an experimental setup with plenty of possible external forces that have yet to be investigated.  Honestly, I don't think it's worth investigating at all. There are much better things to apply our time and money to. If we were in a world where time and money were not limited, I'd be happy to see someone study this, though."

nasa,3cgosh,jcameroncooper,14,Tue Jul 7 19:43:43 2015 UTC,"I have all of this data!  But no, I cannot share.  All the documents are ITAR controlled, and the database software (quite custom, as you can imagine) is owned by Boeing, not by NASA.  There are a few pieces of windows software that query a common database; scids95 (Shuttle Configuration & Information Display Program), mdigap95 (Gap Filler Display Program), and mapit (Tile Display Program).  The database includes information on which tile was on each orbiter for each flight, and maintenance information.  (The chances of any of this being allowed to be released publicly is probably nil.)  Another database called TIPS had the XYZ coordinates for the corners of each tile.  I think this was an older system that didn't run under windows, and is probably no longer accessible.  It was possible to dump all those corner points into excel though, and some of these files have been provided to a museum that has a shuttle.  More interesting to the public at large though, I think, would be the ""CATMAPS"" tile maps.  These were visually stunning and dimensionally accurate 2D drawings created with CATIA modeling software.  (They were actually drawn at full scale, but were labeled 1/20th, the scale I presume they were usually printed; I had to reduce to 1/40th to get them within the limits of a PDF.)  Every tile is labeled with its number and a key indicating type, and heavy lines around groups of tiles show the specific installation drawing that put them there.  Maintaining these maps was a full time job for one engineer; they were updated for each vehicle and flight up through the early 2000's.  She deleted all but the latest versions for each vehicle before leaving that position.  These were not released through the same channels as other production drawings; I think NASA only ever got hard copies, for reference in the hangars when making repairs.  Although most of the old CATIA v4 (unix) data works just fine in CATIA v5 (windows), there was a problem with these drawings due to the custom font, which was essential to interpret the key.  (Forward slant and aft slant, kind of like reverse italics, had a particular meaning, and couldn't be replicated.)  So, before the old system was shut down permanently in 2011, yours truly spent most of a weekend saving all those drawings as PDF vector files, so they'd be future proof.  I figured they were historically significant, and would be a boon to model makers.  Not sure what to do with them all though!  I did get permission to provide some of them a museum that has a shuttle, after some initial missteps due to ITAR issues.  (I learned my lesson and will not be making those mistakes again.)"
nasa,3cgosh,TheWackyNeighbor,2,Tue Jul 7 22:22:37 2015 UTC,"Wow, fascinating stuff! I'm surprised the tile layout falls under ITAR. I wonder if things have changed since the retirement of the orbiters."
nasa,3cgosh,yatpay,6,Tue Jul 7 23:54:54 2015 UTC,"When in doubt, it's under ITAR.  The fact that they are now museum pieces makes no difference.  (The shuttle program did have some sort of waiver from the usual ITAR marking requirements on their paperwork, but even without the markings, all related technical information is subject to ITAR control.)"

nasa,3cgosh,yatpay,2,Wed Jul 8 00:19:51 2015 UTC,"So I've worked at NASA a couple of times as an intern and now have a shuttle tile myself (legally, I assure you).  I'm aware of the ITAR issue, but would there be any way to get this information for one or two specific tiles?  Could I have an official request for information sent from an @nasa.gov email or something?  I'd love to know more!!  PS - good work on taking the initiative on this, by the way!! Too often we just let history claim ""outdated info"" and end up wishing we'd had better record of years later."
nasa,3cgosh,reindeerflot1lla,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:23:54 2015 UTC,"If you ever go back to nasa, they have an internal database that has some of the data about flight history, and also some drawings (though their drawings are more about the shape of the tile itself, not where it was located). You can access the database just by being connected to the nasa network.   I was able to find information about some of my space shuttle tiles and flown blankets before I left."
nasa,3cgosh,Spaceguy5,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:01:46 2015 UTC,"From some googling, I found this PDF which mentions something called the Thermal Information Processing System (TIPS) database which recorded when each tile was replaced or repaired. The database is also referenced in this report on the Columbia investigation. I've not been able to find any way to access this database or any excerpts from it, nor have I found even a single mention of it outside those documents, but it seems relevant. Since the 2 pdfs I found are from 1995 and 2003, it was probably in use for at least the last half of the shuttle program and should have most of the information that guy is looking for."

nasa,3br0ki,Sgtblazing,5,Wed Jul 1 19:31:46 2015 UTC,"Apparently it's about 384,400 km to the Moon and Pluto is only a little bit smaller than that so it should look pretty sizable that close."

nasa,3br0ki,pistol_pedro,5,Wed Jul 1 20:50:40 2015 UTC,"According to the AMA the team that manages NH, at closest approach it will have a resolution of 80 meters/pixel, as they put it 'enough to see parks and large buildings on Earth surface' (If it was that close to us)  So yeah, Pluto and Charon will get full hd pics. Hopefully they spin fast so we can get the full map and not be like Mercury that's half done and has some weird blurry strip in most maps."

It seems like even though space is very empty that there would be a lot of tiny sand grain side particles that could do some damage at 14km/s.  On a long mission, say to Mars, what are the statistical odds of a micrometeorite impact at some point on the journey? 99%  1%?"

nasa,3br0ki,fullmoan,2,Wed Jul 8 19:20:40 2015 UTC,"Very, very low. You will find more crap in the proximity of massive objects thanks to their attractive gravity wells, so it is very unlikely that NH will encounter anything more than some stray protons on its remote journey to Pluto's orbit. It probably had a greater chance of colliding with anything of significance in its first few hours of flight than it will for the rest of its journey into the interstellar medium."
nasa,3br0ki,BrewCityChaser,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:39:14 2015 UTC,"High speed particles are indeed a problem for spacecraft. Luckily, (at least for interplanetary spacecraft) most of the problematic particle matter is gathered around earth, so once a spacecraft is on its way through the solar system, the odds of getting hit by a large enough particle to do damage are fairly small. In cases where a detrimental impact has a high probability, operations are used to help prevent damage. For example, a spacecraft might maneuver to point its antenna in the direction of motion."

Fall is one of the best times to intern because there typically are a lot less students than spring/summer, meaning there are more opportunities.  If you do well, you likely will be able to extend your fall internship into the spring and summer.    Also, NASA internships are one of the best ways to position yourself for the Pathways (aka co-op) program. Apply every chance you get.

May as well throw in the Proton loss, too, maybe we can get a bulk discount.  All from this year, I believe.  Haven't even hit the damned halfway point yet!  Far as Zvezda's prop system, maybe it goes kaput or kaboom - from the looks of things it's been a little dodgy over the past decade.  At the rate the Russians alone are going, NASA et al had better hope they continue to support our fledgling domestic launch suppliers.  Hell, since the Ariane came online it's had two complete failures and two partials.  Irrelevant, since the ATV's been discontinued.  Orbital knowingly threw 40 year old 'refurbished' NK-33's in their rockets with crossed fingers.  That is negligence - and frankly, having read up on it, I'm surprised their space program had as many successful flights as it did.  As a counterpoint to your ""putting the brakes on"" comment:    The government is damned lucky that the COTS program worked out at all.    They're even luckier that Musk risked his fortune building SpaceX - with Orb's failure probably a foregone conclusion given the prop hardware, the Russians likely still engaging in sanction-worthy antics, and ULA's RD-180's being severely at risk in that scenario from both sides of the pond, along with our space partnership - love to know what they'd do without SpaceX.  Head to Sports Authority and buy out their trampoline supplies?  Cause all I see being left is the Delta series of rockets domestically, period, full stop - and that'd slaughter NASA's allotted budget to purchase.  Overseas, we'd have the HTV and maybe, maybe Progress/Soyuz - and don't think that the Russkies wouldn't put us over a barrel and then some as regards pricing - if not because of the monopoly as they have before, then just as a big ""Fuck you!"" from Rogozin and friends over Crimea.  I'd be very, very nice to SpaceX and Orbital if I were the government right now, because they're just a little short on options and both companies can refuse to do business and simply launch commercial stuff if we get right down to it.

nasa,3bcqr7,Twisted0n3,2,Sat Jun 27 23:56:34 2015 UTC,There'd be nothing to brace against. Assuming the payload mass was equal to the launcher mass you'd just end up moving at 3km/s in opposite directions. You'd need to make the launcher a lot heavier than your payloads or have some way to counter the forces. Probably wouldn't work out to be cheaper that conventional launches.
nasa,3bcqr7,stom,0,Sun Jun 28 02:25:22 2015 UTC,Supposing we were able to break the outer space treaty and place a device capable of shooting a projectile at a high rate of speed on the moon. Would we be able to produce a more efficient launch speed for deep space travel? My though is that in my life time i will see another inhabitable planet explored like we did to mars with the exception of their being liquid and land masses. and as i said on spacepaulZ's comment I'm not thinking of a launch from earth to space I'm thinking full on star trek space platform here.
nasa,3bcqr7,stom,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:32:30 2015 UTC,"A launcher canon on the moon could be useful, especially if we're doing the manufacturing there. Much easier to build and move out if we have a cheaper place to launch from (in terms of DeltaV). However, you're not going to get into orbit of the target body without applying some kind of thrust when you get there. Given that you're potentially moving at a speed close to light, you're going to have to slow down a LOT.   You could simulate this in Kerbal quite quickly with infinite fuel. You'll find the braking engine needs a huge TWR to be able to execute the maneuver in the fraction of a second/few seconds before you're already out of that bodies sphere of influence. Any passengers need to endure the resulting G-forces.  Slingshots would possibly slow you down a little, or a lot if you hit something with an atmosphere, but dissipating the temperatures generated by aerobraking at a reasonable % of c is something we can't do with current and isn't likely to be available any time soon. You might change your trajectory but if you're travelling this fast you're still likely to escape the system.  But lets go back to my initial comment for a second, about how firing something from an orbiting space gun would exert a force back on the gun. If you kept firing the gun with small bullets, you could keep increasing it's speed. If you had a rail gun with (for examples sake) an unlimited supply of bullets, you could accelerate indefinitely at a nice, slow pace suitable for us squishy humans and you'd have a way to slow down when you got there.   This is the basis of the ion propulsion systems others have mentioned here. Instead of bullets they fire an ionized xenon particle. There's a video by JPL about it here that's got some more info.   tl;dr: Maybe. Not soon.  Edit: Shoulda reloaded. /u/spacepaulZ beat me to it."
nasa,3bcqr7,spacepaulZ,2,Sun Jun 28 07:37:20 2015 UTC,"The amount of air resistance on the projectile while it is in the rail gun is not negligible but is much smaller compared to the force of the electric field pushing the projectile out.  From the video you cant really tell if the projectile is tightly fitting in the barrel of the gun or not.  I suspect that it is not a tight fit allowing air to move past which alleviates some air resistance.  Without more details about the gun it is impossible to do a calculation of what the speed would be in a vacuum but I suspect that it would not be much faster than Mach 6.  NASA doesn't use these sorts of guns to launch stuff into space because of the air resistance encountered when the projectile leaves the gun would rip it to shreds.  There has actually been quite a lot of research into launching stuff into space with guns including those powered by nuclear blasts, (see this http://nextbigfuture.com/2010/03/150-kiloton-nuclear-verne-gun.html ) but it has been shown to be impractical.    It is unlikely that anyone would use a rail gun to launch a spacecraft on an interplanetary trajectory because rail guns like the one in the video you sent require so much electricity and also a lot of heavy electronics to discharge that electricity in a few miliseconds.  Remember at the end when the guy in the suit was showing how large the power supplies had to be to power the rail gun and the smallest one was around 10% the size of the ship?  since it cost over $10,000 per pound to put something in space putting a rail gun like that into space would be hella expensive!"
nasa,3bcqr7,spacepaulZ,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:47:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not purposing a launch from earth into space, I'm purposing a launch from say the moon or even some sort of pro pulsed platform that would use a large amount of thrust when firing. Also I would not think of launching a spacecraft because of the large amount of g forces that would be put onto a body in a small amount of time. Possible a satellite with a camera."
nasa,3bcqr7,spacepaulZ,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:28:48 2015 UTC,"Here is another thought.  An ion engine, like on NASA's Dawn spacecraft currently orbiting the dwarf planet Ceres, is sort of like a rail gun only it shoots out ionized atoms instead of chunks of metal.  So in a way we are already using this sort of technology in space only on a much smaller scale."

nasa,3bcqr7,spacepaulZ,0,Sun Jun 28 03:42:04 2015 UTC,But with the speed of electricity being 50-99% the speed of light we would potentially be able to produce a rail gun that would fire a projectile at a speed close to light.

On the Space Shuttle, they protected the aluminum hull from the heat of reentry. The tiles were not mechanically attached to the craft, but were instead glued so they could be easily repaired. Many of the tiles were replaced after each flight, especially after a damaged heat shield led to the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia in 2003."""

Though I can't speak for JPL directly, I will say there was a lot of chemical propulsion work, especially on the macro scale, being done at Marshall Space Flight Center, with the big engines being tested at Stennis. If propulsion research is where you want to go, this may have more opportunities (though I'll warn you, the job market is a tough one to break into!). JPL is one of the few remaining centers I've not been able to visit, but it seems to fit more with the research centers (Glenn, Armstrong, etc) aspect, where there may be some smaller early-development thrusters and materials research being done, but likely by much smaller teams."

nasa,3b90t3,Lars0,3,Sat Jun 27 11:59:12 2015 UTC,"JPL does zero (or nearly zero) work on chemical propulsion. They do have electric propulsion programs there. As another commenter said NASA's chemical propulsion development efforts are focused at Marshall Spaceflight Center and Stennis, but if you look around there are niches of propulsion at a lot of centers.  That said, NASA is hardly the only game in town. There are private companies all over the US that do rocket propulsion, in addition to the DoD."
nasa,3b90t3,wintear,2,Sat Jun 27 21:18:24 2015 UTC,"JPL does plenty of stuff, but possibly not at the scale you're looking for.

Although NASA has improved a lot in recent years, I can't help but feel that its PR-activities still lack quite a bit of ""zing"" that'd make space more accessible for the general public.   Maybe NASA should consider commercial sponsoring by Red Bull or GoPro or something like that. Just slap a big sticker on the Harmony node and drop GoPro's from orbit. Edit the footage into a dope video, add instagram filters, drop some sick beatz and ... profit!!!  (Only half joking here; seriously, why not?)"
nasa,3b0k8e,Arrewar,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:51:24 2015 UTC,Please be fully joking... I think they do need some better content to be created. Space is inherently enthralling. I feel like we just need some good BBC documentaries about what is happening in space right now.
nasa,3b0k8e,spredditer,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:42:39 2015 UTC,"See I fully agree with you, but the same can't be said for the greater general public. For example, compare the publicity Red Bull managed to attract with their Felix Baumgartner stunt vs. the first successful docking of a commercial spacecraft ever to the ISS, just a few months earlier (arguably a much more impressive accomplishment).   Although it's not ideal, I feel space can use some ""sensationalism"" in the PR department. I'm an aerospace engineer (and huge spacenerd) and a lot of NASA's televised material even makes me cringe with an overwhelming sense of ""holy crap this is boring""."
nasa,3b0k8e,Arrewar,0,Thu Jun 25 15:08:11 2015 UTC,"I think the dragon reaching the ISS is technically impressive, but it isn't very spectacular or emotive. We've seen many rocket launches and the berthing was the definition of tedious. There just weren't any people on board. People won't care unless there is someone they can relate to and get a human perspective from. Redbull are interested in risky things without necessity. NASA is about minimising risk. The two motivations are opposite. I do think that there needs to be some better content. I just think that Redbull are the wrong people to be looking at. And I think Redbull is more about funding the stunts which I don't think NASA would be interested in."

This has nothing to do with the point I'm trying to make, nor am I judging these accomplishments based on their technical impressiveness. All I'm saying is that they have a better marketing department than NASA, and I think that there is a lot of potential to popularize space-related activities for the purpose of engaging a greater part of the public in space and/or STEM related fields.   Also consider this; back in the 60's and 70's Apollo astronauts were culturally seen as rock stars, celebrities, stunt pilots who had ""the right stuff"". But nowadays, they have been replaced by ""boring"" scientists and somewhat anal-retentive military types. Of course there are notable exceptions (Hadfield, Cristoforetti spring to mind), but overall, the general public opinion is very disconnected with space activities. It could use a bit of sensationalism."
nasa,3b0k8e,Arrewar,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:20:21 2015 UTC,I guess what I'm trying to say is that going to the ISS isn't some highly risky thing that Redbull would want to sponsor. I agree with you that NASA's publicity could be much more engaging.

nasa,3akq3s,AtomicSteve21,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:53:12 2015 UTC,"Well, it's one of the big three for sending people to Mars isn't it?   1) Bone density loss due to low gravity  2) Radiation exposure  3) 6 months of Supplies/Weight/Vehicle Requirements  Off the top of my head, it seems like we're looking for 1) some sort of artificial gravity, 2) radiation shielding on the spacecraft, and 3) better propulsion or some way to lessen the human physical requirements.   *I am in no way qualified to come up with these conclusions."
nasa,3akq3s,LithiumEnergy,2,Sun Jun 21 16:53:40 2015 UTC,"This is my logic on this matter:  Bone density loss is caused by the body adapting to the microgravity environment.  Since there is no gravity the body dosn't have a reason to have such dense bones.  So what affects the bones is the absence of gravity.  Exercise clearly helps but it dosn't solve the problem.  My question is:  Is there a way to trigger the body to replenish bone density faster then usual?  Meaning that if there is a way to replenish bone density other than having a downwards force exerted on the body (gravity).  May be there is a whay to make the body ""crave"" denser bones.  Something that triggers bone growth."
nasa,3akq3s,clammyjmoosen,3,Sun Jun 21 04:04:03 2015 UTC,"It is the absence of shock and strain that your body is used to, just as if you lay down on a bed every day your bones would lose density.  Triggering bone growth is as simple as exercising and providing your body with calcium and other nutrients to help them grow."
nasa,3akq3s,clammyjmoosen,2,Sun Jun 21 14:21:22 2015 UTC,"Kind of. Bone loss in space is influence by a loss of mechanical load, like you stated, but there's also evidence that the increase in radiation exposure causes additional losses. You would see local bone loss in cancer patients exposed to radiation therapy as well."
nasa,3akq3s,stardustandsteel,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:39:24 2015 UTC,"The human body is very good at reaching a homeostatic state, or a happy medium, for all bodily systems (including the density of your bones). Bones are only as strong as they need to be for what stress you put them under. That's why the new exercise regimes that astronauts are using are doing awesome things to improve bone density. But, bottom line, unless you're sitting and walking in the same way as you do on Earth, your body is going to adapt.  So, other than an artificial gravity ship, what can we do? Some research is being done on suits that compress the body, putting a mechanical load on your skeleton. I'm not following the results to see how well it's working, but I think it got to flight tests. Other ideas are building small exercise rigs that use artificial gravity, usually using centrifugal force. Another hope is that we can learn enough about the complicated biological signalling pathway that tells the body that it's not being compressed and to stop that signal. This is biology in it's finest and it's very hard to piece together. Lots of great researchers are working on the problem though!"
nasa,3akq3s,florpis,2,Mon Jun 22 00:46:38 2015 UTC,"I led a project at my university (just graduated) for the past three years to address this very problem. We even were picked by NASA to fly our prototype in their last zero gravity flight.   We are trying to understand the actual mechanism of osteoblast ""death"", so to speak, in bone cells using a small satellite bioreactor. If we can observe the behavior of bone-building cells in zero gravity, then maybe a solution can be found. We also plan to test various pharmaceuticals on the bone cells to see if there's any positive reaction on the osteoblasts.   All current studies on this have been rat studies in space; send the mice/rats up, perform experiments, kill mice, and send them back to Earth and look at their bones. Our method would be to take the cells and ""maintain"" them in the bioreactor and mimic a living system, but in a way that you can actually see and observe the cell behavior."

It is designed to reflect radiant heat, protect against convective heat, and trap breathable air (most firefighters' deaths are from inhaling hot gases) in an attempt to save the firefighter's life. First required in the United States in 1977, fire shelters are constructed layers of aluminum foil, woven silica, and fiberglass. When deployed, its maximum dimensions are 86 in. x 15.5 in. x 31 in. (approximately 218.44 cm x 39.37 cm x 78.74 cm) and has a shape like a mound. When the shelter is packed into its carrying case, its dimensions are 8.5 in. x 5.5 in. x 4 in. (approximately 21.59 cm x 13.97 cm x 10.16 cm). The new-generation fire shelter was developed in 2002 to replace the old style fire shelter which is shaped like a pup-tent and has a carrying case. Its dimensions are smaller than that of the old-generation shelter.

Another thing is the work needed to get you away from the iss - I dont know the details but I would assume you cant open the Airlock to space unless its completly decompressed which means it wouldnt get a push out there. perhaps you could move it out with the Canadarm2 but even if its pretty slow...the Momentum wouldnt be that huge (it might take hours for the body to drift away). If Candarm doesnt work you would have to do an EVA...which takes hours to prepare and is a huge effort in general (besides being pretty depressing for the astronaut). Again: No they wouldnt do that"

So there must be some procedures in place, and I'm wondering what those might be for a variety of scenarios.  Where this all began was a discussion over in TIL about Sally Ride and how NASA had no idea how many tampons she would need to bring with her into space. I remembered something from somewhere about how NASA had little real idea of how a person would bleed in space during the Apollo missions; I was trying to find a reference to that (unfortunately, searching for ""NASA preparation for cuts in space"" turned up a whole different set of results) when I came across the document I linked above. It glancingly touches on the subject with the discussion of fluid changes in the body, blood pressure, etc., but didn't answer the question."
nasa,3a2r0j,demux4555,3,Tue Jun 16 21:02:08 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe you could rephrase your question into two new separate questions:   How bad would a medical emergency have to be before they return to Earth?  And how really really bad will it have to be for them to not bother returning to Earth at all? (and just let the astronaut die)   I'm guessing they would have to decide right there and then how to proceed. And to be honest, I think they would prepare for return to Earth no matter how bad it is, even if an astronaut is fatally injured or sick. Who knows, they might make it back in time after all."
nasa,3a2r0j,demux4555,3,Tue Jun 16 21:32:15 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't see any scenario where NASA would just let an astronaut die. Say, appendicitis. They would bring them back to Earth and hang the cost. If they make it, great; if they don't, they tried. But that's still only pertinent to potentially fatal cases; what about something where you'd really just be dealing with, say, a bad infection, scarring, and impaired ability?"
nasa,3a2r0j,GeOrGiE-,6,Tue Jun 16 21:40:32 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_treatment_during_spaceflight https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illness_and_injuries_during_spaceflight    In a few cases, astronauts were brought back to Earth due to episodes of renal colic and arrhythmia, shortening their stays in space and possibly ending their missions.   Some interesting statistics here:   The calculated rate of significant illness or injury on submarines, Antarctic expeditions, military aviation and space flight was found to be approximately 0.06 cases per person-year. If we use this data to evaluate the rate of occurrence of a medical emergency to a 2.5-year Mars mission, assuming six crew members, we get a rate of 0.9 cases per people/mission. In other words, one significant medical event could be expected per Mars mission. These estimates are likely to be low, as they do not deal with the unique problems that are associated with the space environment: radiation effects and exposure and physiological adaptation to low gravity."
nasa,3a2r0j,NoeticIntelligence,3,Tue Jun 16 22:01:53 2015 UTC,"Yea I can't see the NASA decision makers telling an astronaut to not come back for a reason other than it would not be safe at the moment. Can you imagine the backlash if they did that? Growing up in the 80's, I remember shuttle liftoffs were a big deal, especially the the lead up to the Challenger and its aftermath. The last thing NASA would want to happen is for a space mission, that has slipped into the public's consciousness, to have an astronaut get sick and die, even if there was only a 1% chance of survival coming back to Earth. It wouldn't help their budget. I think the best answer is to have more medical training on board and give the astronauts all of the tools they need to save each other. While not adding too much weight."
nasa,3a2r0j,Texasfitz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:49:03 2015 UTC,"Does NASA control the ISS?     The ISS programme is a joint project among five participating space agencies: NASA, Roscosmos, JAXA, ESA, and CSA.[15][17] The ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements.[18] The station is divided into two sections, the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS) and the United States Orbital Segment (USOS), which is shared by many nations Source   As far as I can see they would have to evacuate the space station completely to send one  injured cosmonaut home.   Or you could leave people up there with no way of getting home if something happens.      You could schedule a visit, but what if you spent the many millions to make it happen and the cosmonaut died before it arrived?  I am certain that they have basic medical training, or at least one of them does.  They can attempt a procedure on the station, of course that would be a lot more  dangerous than doing it on earth.    So for political reasons they could say they would try to do it on station, even though it was a lot more risky.   I think cosmonauts know what they do is dangerous and most have come to  some understanding that they might die up there.   Traditionally a lot of people in space come from a military background where such things are well understood.  You must also keep in mind the strain that going back puts on a regular healthy  person, and shipping someone home is quite likely to kill them if they have a serious emergency.    The end result, space station evacuated, one dead astronaut."
nasa,3a2r0j,kmccoy,2,Tue Jun 16 23:45:21 2015 UTC,"The ISS does not need to be evacuated if one crewmember is sick enough to need to come home.  There are 2 spacecraft docked at all times.  Right now that is 2 Soyuz spacecraft.  Each one holds 3 people.  If one of the crewmembers needs to return, the other 2 crewmembers that he rode up with will take him down.  If immediate hospitalization is required, they will target the Soyuz to land in mainland Europe or the U.S because of the good coverage of hospitals and good transportation network to get them from the spacecraft to a hospital. Every space agency will do everything in their power to get a crewmember to medical care as quickly as possible"
nasa,3a2r0j,Sgtblazing,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:17:12 2015 UTC,"Bad timing for your comment here, because actually the ISS is currently in the midst of a crew rotation and therefore occupied by 3 people and they only have one spacecraft available for return to Earth.  The other three people and other Soyuz spacecraft should be launching next month or so."
nasa,3a2r0j,Texasfitz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:57:13 2015 UTC,"His point remains though,  they have 3 men in orbit and a capsule that can bring 3 back standing by.  I am amazed that the Russians might consider landing in the US in their capsule though.   I know it would have been unthinkable to land a shuttle in Russia but obviously there is a large difference between the tech.  Would NASA allow an Orion (not as intertwined in national security)  to land in Russian hands?"

Two, the file you linked is about 1500 lines of code, it's an excerpt from page 1452 to about 1480.  So yes, this is evidence that there was quite a bit of code (30000 line project if we assume 20 lines per page), but it does not address the question of how much of it was written by a single person.  I have no idea whether or not the claim is true, either way she and her team did a hell of a job.

nasa,385t8d,I_cut_my_own_jib,3,Tue Jun 2 01:37:57 2015 UTC,"It has to do with the uneven surface of a meteor/comet and rotational axes.  Its easier to have a project like laser bees (Planetary society) show up to the asteroid and heat up the surface to release gas to push it, than it is to send a rocket engine up (sending up all that fuel as well) and having either the  rotational period of the object give us a huge headache because it spins on all 3 axes causing us to have to fire the engine when the rotational period is correct meaning constant recalculations.(not the hardest thing to do but do you really want another variable in the possible destruction of earth?)  Or the surface of said object is soft/mushy like sand or is unstable, which would make it harder to apply pressure to the object without the the engine mount slipping/pulling off parts of the object.   I'll try and clean this up a bit, its kinda a mess but that's the gist of what I've heard/thought out."
nasa,385t8d,Ididntknowwehadaking,2,Tue Jun 2 03:44:05 2015 UTC,Hmm the rotation is something that I didn't really consider.  But wouldn't that be a problem for almost all other proposed methods?  Besides nuking it and kinetic bombing it.   And I'm not sure if the gravity tractor idea would be affected by rotation just because the rocket would have to be far enough away to make sure it doesn't get hit by a protrusion of the asteroid as it rotates but also close enough for the gravitational effect to be significant enough.
nasa,385t8d,Ididntknowwehadaking,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:19:29 2015 UTC,"Well from what I understand the laser bees are basically mirrors that focus light and heat up ice/rock until it vaporizes, meaning they can chill on one side of the object and continuously vaporize the rock and acquire new areas on the same side causing a continuous push against the object.   The ""gravity tractor"" is not a Star trek/Star wars tractor beam, its basically a very large weight with ion thrusters that uses its own gravitational pull to attract the object. However we would have to send the craft up +20 years in advance. If I remember correctly it only affects the object an inch or two over the span of ten years, which would most likely be enough given time/distance. (I'm sure someone can show the math) but time would be a huge factor.  //edit The solar sail while cool would have the same problem with rotational stability, it would be dependent on keeping the sails aligned with the sun while rotating and still provide a push in the correct direction, a big headache still.  And as far as lasers I don't see much of a problem except possible chemical/fuel components and complexity for lasers being an issue. Weight/amount needed etc, while space bees are basically mirrors that don't need chemicals for the object pushing mechanism. I'm sure space bees has a few issues somewhere, solar mirror yield, gasses causing particles to refract/bounce around lowering effectiveness but I haven't heard to much, I guess I probably should go research it a bit."

The tech being tested here is intended for much larger payloads (like habitats and landers for manned missions). If its judged to be mature enough technology by then they might use it just to get some experience using it in a real martian entry, but theres no actual need to do so and its probably cheaper to rely on existing designs from Curiosity when possible"

nasa,37wr9q,reindeerflot1lla,4,Sun May 31 04:49:00 2015 UTC,"100% impossible for a number of reasons.  The ISS was still under construction and is not built to handle this sudden influx of people, much less capable back then (air and liquid recirculation systems would be quickly overwhelmed going from 3 to 10). Getting there would be the primary issue though.  Imagine hitting a 100m target going mach 25 with a jet going mach 25 at a different angle and altitude. There simply would not be the fuel or capability to do it in time with the fuel and air supply given.  After the return to flight, the shuttles docked or met up with the ISS for co-support and to allow for exterior examinations prior to reentry.  Before that point, the only three options they had were a possible second crew rescue, an EVA to self-repair, or returning to earth & hoping for the best.  It was decided that the first two options were not practical (would take too long for a rescue with a full crew onboard and there weren't the proper materials and procedures in place to attempt an EVA repair), so they would not alert the crew and hope for the best."

This material is the same as was used on the Mercury and Apollo heat shields, called AVCOAT. It's a resin that is injected into honeycomb material and is ablative, meaning it once small sections of the surface reach a critical temperature they flake off, allowing the next piece to absorb energy. This is critical in removing heat from the heat shield rather than letting it build up during reentry.  The injection process can be seen in this video."

The initial monolithic design was for testing the actual ablater and thickness out. Avcoat hasn't been made in 45 years - the new formula was changed because some of the properties of the old have been outlawed by the EPA.   Before the EFT-1 flight they had plans to move from a monolithic shell to a tiled shell, but they needed the post flight date before committing 100% to the change.

The RS-25 does have the highest Specific Impulse (more a measure of efficiency than ""power"") of any 1st stage engine, but there are many other engines with much higher Specific Impulse (just not used in 1st stages), so this can't be the metric they are talking about.  The currently operational RD-171M has ~17% more Thrust (what most people think of when they hear ""power"" in relation to a rocket engine) than even the retired F-1 did and is almost 2.5x the Thrust of the RS-25. And there are also several more 1st stage engines with more Thrust than the RS-25 (including the US built RS-68A), so this also can't be the metric they are talking about.  SpaceX's Merlin 1D currently holds the Thrust-to-Weight Ratio record at almost 2.5x the RS-25, so this can't be the metric they are talking about either.

nasa,37hbw3,dkozinn,3,Wed May 27 18:43:54 2015 UTC,"Yep it's part of a multi-step reconfiguration of the ISS to prepare for the Commercial Crew Vehicles. It's easier to explain in bullet form:   Moving the PMM from Unity nadir port to Tranquility forward port opens up that port as the backup docking spot for the Commercial Cargo (Dragon and Cygnus) vehicles. The main Commercial Cargo vehicle berthing spot is the nadir port of the Harmony module. Up until now the backup Cargo port  was the zenith (space-facing) port of the Harmony module (so on the opposite side of the main one). By moving the PMM we now have 2 backup spots (temporarily). The new Commercial Crew vehicles (Dragon 2 and CST-100) will be docking to the Pressurized Mating Adapters (the same ones that the Shuttles docked with, although they'll be getting an adapter attached to them later on this year). There will be two docking ports for these crew vehicles, PMA-2 currently on the forward facing port of the Harmony module and PMA-3 which is currently on the Port-side port of the Tranquility module (you can see it in the diagram I linked above, it's just above the green PMM with the white end cap). PMA-3 is however not accessible in it's current location (solar panels and other stuff in the way) so it will be relocated to the zenith port of the Harmony module, the original cargo vehicle backup spot which is why PMM had to be moved to make a new cargo backup spot. So to summarize: Once all the moving is done Commercial Crew vehicles will dock at PMA-2 on the forward Harmony port with PMA-3 as backup on the zenith Harmony port. And Commercial Cargo vehicles will berth at the nadir Harmony port with the nadir Unity port as backup.   If you want to know more about the relocation operations and preparing the ISS for Commercial Crew Vehicles I recommend: http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2013/07/nasa-planning-module-relocations-future-vehicles/  Also in case you need a map to follow along while reading my above text (it gets confusing I know) here's the wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station#Station_structure (not updated to reflect PMMs move yet)  Hope that wasn't too confusing!"

Even if we can't get under the surface we could drill a little ways and collect samples. If it's true it's spraying geysers then what's underneath could also be on the surface.  This mission is more a mapping mission not a search for life mission. Why not just do both and drop a lander too? Seems like it's even cheaper to include the lander now versus another mission that may or may not work.

To test this they need to test it WAY up in the atmosphere, so they use a balloon to carry it aloft.  This is the tower that it will be launched from eventually.    Also of note is the STAR 48 (IIRC) PAM which will boost HIAD to Hypersonic velocities where the heat shield will inflate to test.  Last time they tested the design the launch and HIAD test went well, except for the parachutes that tore upon deployment in the lower atmosphere."

nasa,3704m4,brickmack,3,Sun May 24 14:34:36 2015 UTC,"See what I posted in response to B787:  The main difference is that HIAD is designed for Earth re-entry, while LDSD SIAD is designed for Mars entry. Since Earth's atmosphere is so dense compared to Mars, that places different design constraints on the two. HIAD is a much more ambitious project from that point of view. It requires the flexible ablative you mentioned for use as a heat shield. LDSD SIAD makes no attempt to be a heat shield. It's just a decelerator to help decrease the size of parachutes (although the real point is to allow for larger payloads)."
nasa,3704m4,wintear,1 point,Sun May 24 19:23:18 2015 UTC,"but they essentially do the same thing right? just tuned for different speeds?  Do both of them use Flexible Ablative on the windward side?

nasa,3704m4,B787_300,2,Sun May 24 15:41:18 2015 UTC,"No problem -- like you said, I did ask for it.  Yep, they're essentially for the same purpose: to slow down reentry.

nasa,36x2y9,Red_Raven,21,Fri May 22 20:53:21 2015 UTC,"You've hit on the major reasons that critics of SLS call it a rocket to nowhere.  With SLS and Orion alone all you can do in deep space is orbit the Moon for a short while and then come home.  Proponents of SLS and Orion see the programs as the first two building blocks of a trip to asteroids or Mars or a return to the Moon.  These missions will of course require the addition of deep space habitats landers transfer stages etc.  None of that other stuff is being developed right now but if/when it is then SLS will be available to launch it.  The last time NASA put together a mars architecture was in the Constellation program.  That architecture called for a bunch of Ares V (which is similar to SLS) launches to assemble a large vehicle in LEO, and then a smaller Ares I launch to carry up Orion and the crew.  With SLS and Orion this architecture is still possible with a commercial vehicle like Falcon Heavy or Vulcan taking the place of the Ares I.  EDIT: The architecture I'm referencing is the DRM 5 which was published while the constellation program was in progress and therefore used Ares and the MPCV for launch and re-entry."
nasa,36x2y9,Neptune_ABC,6,Fri May 22 21:46:00 2015 UTC,IIRC the Block 1B with the exploration upper stage will be capable of delivering Orion + ~10t cargo to trans-Mars-injection. You could easily have a ten ton habitat that the Orion performs a transposition and docking maneuver on for the trip to Mars.
nasa,36x2y9,space_is_hard,5,Fri May 22 22:02:17 2015 UTC,That works for a free return mission but The Constilation architecture DRM 5 was for a surface mission which is why it required so much mass to be put in LEO before launching Orion.  EDIT: DRM 5
nasa,36x2y9,Neptune_ABC,5,Fri May 22 22:07:06 2015 UTC,"The ISS is 500 tons according to Wolfram. That can host about 7 people, and a year is the longest anyone has been up there at once. They may need more space. That's not to mention extra radiation shielding, water, food, fuel, and a lander. Block II is a minivan, which is fine for the moon. If the space shuttle was a pickup truck, then we need a semi truck. Preferably a few of them. Even if we send a lander to Mars orbit with a resource pod to restock the ship ahead of time, we still need a semi truck."

They may need more space.   That's a little bit of a fallacy, because you're comparing two different vehicles with different purposes. ISS is primarily a research laboratory that was expressly designed to be in LEO for two decades. If you look at studies for BLEO transportation the habitat modules are generally much smaller, more mass efficient, and more disposable than a typical ISS module."

nasa,36x2y9,bakutogames,7,Sat May 23 07:57:15 2015 UTC,"That's kind of what I thought. It seems like they had a good plan with Constellation, but something screwed that up (I'm feeling congress and budgets here) and now they're just developing the tools that they can afford to develop at the moment. The goal is still the same, but they're forced to take steps out of order and so they have to come up with a convoluted way of making it seem like a solid plan to the public to keep it's interest, which NASA lives on. I think it can still work. The problem is that I still don't see much in the way of long-duration ship, space habitat, surface habitat, or surface lander development. They very well may end up with the vehicle that can do the task and a crew transfer ship that is more than suited for the task (you don't need to put as much into a crew transport ship as they've put into the Orion; a Dragon V2 could handle transport to LEO and return from it with less mass), but the space and surface modules to get us there and back won't even have prototypes built by then. Once they finally are built and ready to make the trip, the Orion and SLS may very well be outdated in terms of tech, efficiency, reliability, etc. My only hope is the Bigelow module getting shipped to the ISS this year. It already has extensive testing and provides  of space with low weight. The modules still need to be filled out though, and I don't think we have anything in development for the surface, much less landing and take off."

nasa,36o45i,DyslexicHobo,5,Thu May 21 03:27:35 2015 UTC,A better measure would be the total cost spent on each category of mission then. Who will do the math?
nasa,36o45i,YugoReventlov,3,Wed May 20 21:39:40 2015 UTC,Found one already made in the article linked by /u/ImAClimateScientist
nasa,36o45i,ImAClimateScientist,2,Wed May 20 21:47:49 2015 UTC,"Also, using 2010 or 2008 as a baseline is quite arbitrary. The budgets for both planetary and Earth science are still lower than the pre-Bush era in inflation-adjusted dollars. Meanwhile GDP has grown by >70%."
nasa,36o45i,YugoReventlov,2,Wed May 20 21:50:49 2015 UTC,Why are there missions like Rosetta and Mars Express on the left side (which are ESA missions) but not on the right side? (while both are still active)
nasa,36o45i,YugoReventlov,1 point,Wed May 20 21:24:18 2015 UTC,It is data from NASA science directive sorted by launch date.  I think Rosetta and Mars Express are included because NASA collaborated with and funded scientific payloads.  http://science.nasa.gov/missions/  It is a great site to ensure you don't miss out on a mission.
nasa,36o45i,ImAClimateScientist,2,Wed May 20 21:34:09 2015 UTC,"I'm too lazy to count, but do your numbers ""after Obama"" include the still operating ones from before him, or only the ones launched since he was elected?"
nasa,36o45i,YugoReventlov,2,Wed May 20 21:37:28 2015 UTC,I know I'm about to show my true ignorance but I wish there were more budgeted for exploration. Exploring is what first made me decide I want to be an aeronautic engineer
nasa,36o45i,2A_is_the_best_A,6,Thu May 21 10:56:20 2015 UTC,"Two things:   1) Earth science is exploration. We find new things all the time. Long-lost ancient ruins buried in the sand or overgrown with jungle. Canyons bigger than the Grand Canyon.  Mapping mountains at the bottom of the ocean with unprecedented resolution from space, we still know more about the topography of the moon than the bathymetry of the ocean.  These are just a few examples.  2) The NASA budget is smaller today (~$18 billion) adjusted for inflation than it was 20 years ago (~$21 billion). Meanwhile, again adjusted for inflation, our economy has grown more than 60% percent.  We should all be fighting for a bigger pie, rather than arguing about who gets the biggest piece."

nasa,36o45i,ImAClimateScientist,2,Fri May 22 12:45:40 2015 UTC,"This comparison isn't valid when you consider you're looking 6.5 year timeslices of missions that take 20+ years from concept to end of life. Take Suomi/NPP for example, it was more than 6.5 years late.  There's also too much influence from JWST overruns over this time period, not to mention the move of long term monitoring over to NOAA (Suomi/NPP was a huge part of that, you can't really even call it a NASA mission).  Lastly, the ground segment of earth science missions tend to cost more than the satellites themselves. I think the factor is like 3-6x spent on ground vs space for the EOS missions so far. This means it doesn't correlate well with launch dates."
nasa,36o45i,deruch,2,Thu May 21 14:52:32 2015 UTC,I guess this makes sense when you consider how Obama is more focused on climate change than Bush.

nasa,36jivt,tadzioizdat,1 point,Wed May 20 15:40:44 2015 UTC,It is important to note that this funding was not moved away from NASA but only redirected form Earth missions to Exploration missions. I collected data from the NASA science directorate to show you. You can see here that President Obama shifted the course of NASA away from space exploration and towards earth exploration. I am not against earth exploration but I feel another agency should handle that.   This congressional change only aims to give NASA a focus on exploration missions.
nasa,36jivt,Arthur233,13,Wed May 20 20:06:59 2015 UTC,"I wonder how the Senate will deal with this. I found an article from April from the same website.   She (Sen. Mikulski) suggested that, in partnership with Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA, the Senate would not accept the budget the House passes. “So, we’re going to take what the House says and say, ‘Okay, thanks a lot.

This make some sense in light of the cuts to the free flight imager mentioned in this article. That's long term monitoring, clearly. Unfortunately, NOAA doesn't care because it's not the ocean or atmosphere.

But, the power is in the hands of the people. I'm going to make an assumption (blind) that we agree that government is not functioning at optimal efficency?    Anyone who would want to spend their own money on the mission to go to mars should be allowed to do so no matter what the government wants them to spend their money on. I think the destination of taxes should be decided by the people and not the government currently in charge. Everyone has a different opinion on this and I am ready to adjust my taxes in compliance to the majority of the people and their wills, not small groups in power fighting to maintain their power.    For example, in Sweden, anyone born before 1996 is a member of church by default and have to pay taxes to be one. One has the option to leave, but then instead you must pay taxes for your funeral; which I don't want to pay taxes for either. That money can be used for good. I would rather spend that money on cancer research, missions to Mars, education, something I believe is good for all. I think that we need a platform where we can talk amongst each other, peer to peer, to come to agreement on what we want and not only eat of the plates given to us by government. I want the freedom to dedicate my money to wherever I so wish. That want does not make me a bad, evil person looking to destroy society and government given the opportunity.  People wanting to control your hard earned money are bad, evil people.    Sorry, I did slightly touch the debate we saved for another time. Also this might not have been an answer you really cared about but I wanted to write it down.    My suggested solution is on Github/p145085, it puts the responsibility of managing society in the hands of the voters themselves. As a note, this has to be slowly integrated side by side with current government law as to not allow chaos and mayhem if some people think they are free to dismiss the laws."

nasa,35v8oq,memebuster,3,Wed May 13 20:12:43 2015 UTC,I have this original poster from '69. Its a little worse for wear but is glorious in full scale.

nasa,35v8oq,chronicENTity,2,Thu May 14 02:00:48 2015 UTC,"That's what I've been trying to figure out, someone very kindly offered to print it out for me for S&H but I'm trying to work out the logistics of mounting it or framing it before taking him up on it as they do not in fact make inexpensive 72x24 frames let alone a clear cover and board for that. I am considering affixing the top and bottom to wooden rods or boards and using the top one to mount and the bottom to provide weight to hang it like this but I'm dubious photo paper would hold up well to that. I am also considering pasting it to foam core board but am unsure about being able to move it ever and keep it from damage. Would definitely appreciate it if you found something.  The least expensive ""legit"" option is to order a custom canvas print, affix it to stained dowels and hang it with some nice twine. Unfortunately this option is still around $200 as near as I can tell and I don't know for sure how well text shows up on canvas."
nasa,35v8oq,oh_the_humanity,1 point,Thu May 14 02:04:29 2015 UTC,"Put that size into uprinting (not sure if I'm allowed to link site), and the estimation was less than $70 shipped. That was 6' x 2' with a two inch border. No hanging kit, but I would hope the rest is less than $130."
nasa,35v8oq,eric2590,7,Thu May 14 05:48:20 2015 UTC,Cool poster. Can anyone explain the bump in altitude from step 130 to 131 ?
nasa,35v8oq,prometheus5500,3,Wed May 13 21:50:30 2015 UTC,"I'm only speculating, but my first guess would be lift from coming in so fast and finally reaching atmosphere with non-negligible density."
nasa,35v8oq,mrintercepter,6,Wed May 13 23:13:10 2015 UTC,"That's correct. Basically, they ""fly"" via a small amount of lift generated by the heat shielding. The process helps remove energy before they reenter, improving the chances of a successful reentry.    Edit: Found a very cool video about it:    Use this link for more explanation (watch until about 15:45).     Or this link to go directly to exactly what we're talking about."

nasa,35v8oq,prometheus5500,0,Wed May 13 21:50:42 2015 UTC,Oddly?.. Appropriately.
nasa,35v8oq,prometheus5500,3,Thu May 14 05:58:53 2015 UTC,"Putting this on my gift list. Super cool. Question though, what do you mean by cleaned and upscaled? Is the poster available here not going to look as good? Or did you just clean up the image purely for computer viewing?"
nasa,35v8oq,historynerd87,2,Thu May 14 02:14:38 2015 UTC,"That poster is what inspired me to do this, specifically, I bought that poster and a frame for it and was underwhelmed by the size, the text is only readable if you get up close to it and the details really don't show until you get that close either, definitely not the giant wall reference I was hoping for, also it was designed with no border in mind and my standard thin frame covers up a bit of text on the edges. So then I figured if I get the highest quality version I could then maybe I could have it custom printed, unfortunately the most original image I could find was the Smithsonian scan which has wrinkles in it from damage over time. The company selling that poster presumably has an undamaged master file that predates the Smithsonian scan as there's is wrinkle and text damage free but their master does not appear to exist in the online public domain. Another redditor a few years ago ran some intense color correction on the Smithsonian scan (a bit too much for my taste but that's just that, taste) but also did a great job of cleaning up the wrinkles, unfortunately he also introduced some jpeg artifacts around the text which I'd hate to have show up in print. So in my final version I added a border of about an inch around the whole thing so it can be comfortably framed, I removed almost all of the jpeg artifacts, I toned the colors back to near the original (I like how it looks old), I sharpened up the text, corrected a few other issues I found leftover from the original as well as a lot of the noise in the background black and then ran upscaling on it sufficient to print it at 240 ppi2 on 72""x24"" paper.  I have since discovered how expensive printing something that large at a custom size is let alone framing it but hopefully other people can use it and maybe I or we will figure something out."

nasa,35v8oq,bazookajoe1983,1 point,Thu May 14 02:04:19 2015 UTC,Never realized there were so many stages just for launch. Nor did I know they had to update the computers so often. My guess is they didn't have the storage capacity to store all the control programs for each stage of the mission so they had radio in new code each step of the way.   I've  taken computers and KSP for granted so much.  This was definitely one of the greatest technological wonders of human history just for the shear fact they basically flew in a tin can and some wires compared to today. And the enormity of it will just continue to grow.

I only had one class  but my professor in that class nominated me for a NASA Summer workshop about Human Space Exploration. In two weeks, I'm going to be visiting Kennedy Space Center with 29 other students from various STEM majors. We're going to learn about the challenges of life in space and we will be given a challenge to solve during the month of June.  I did not think that STEM would be my passion. I told people I wanted to be an artist when I grew up and I worked as a sushi chef before I decided to go back into school. I hated STEM classes growing up but my college transcript is proof that I did better in STEM than my ""main"" classes. Anyway, I really appreciate that you have started these social media accounts and I will definitely follow you on Twitter and Instagram! Congratulations to you and your team!"

nasa,35q2md,Marcosprochovs,3,Tue May 12 16:05:27 2015 UTC,"Hi Marcos. NASA won't directly hire you, but come on over to JPL. We are technically Caltech employees, so we hire plenty of foreign nationals. Physics or engineering is fine, just make sure you do your PhD at an American university."
nasa,35q2md,schad060,1 point,Wed May 13 06:31:33 2015 UTC,"I think physics is just fine if you have more interest in it than, say, aerospace engineering. For non-us citizens I don't know the policy, but that might be a restriction...the only non-us citizen intern I met was from Puerto Rico.  I would recommend applying often to internships at NASA. They have a great program called OSSI (One Stop Shopping Initiative) where you can apply to multiple internships with a single application (up to 10 I believe). That is how I got my first internship at NASA-MSFC. From my experience, NASA is very willing to get freshman and sophomore interns which is not the case for a lot of companies so don't be afraid to apply right away! And I know you were asking about getting hired vs internships, but NASA hires their interns pretty often."
