These Reaper Bones 3 minis are targeted to ship in September 2016. If it's like any Kickstarter I have ever been a part of they will miss this target and anyone backing it should put realistic expectations into early 2017.   I love the Reaper Bones line, great  price and great detail in the minis, and love the fact they're doing Mythos sculpts so it's worth every penny. Just be advised, if this is your first miniature Kickstarter, that these projects have long fulfillment  and are often late."
Cthulhu,3drzk5,onlineFace,2,Mon Jul 20 01:42:21 2015 UTC,"Regarding Shipping, this is Reaper's 3rd time to the dance expanding their Bones line... For Bones 1 and 2, they schedule a 6 month delivery. The first time  the popularity was so overwhelming that in all it ended up a few months late. The second time, they were prepared... and then there was the massive shipping strike that held things up for a couple months. So this time they've just scheduled it for one year to make sure they won't be late. (Wave 1 ships in august.)   So while I agree with you that delays can be (and often are) an issue with Kickstarters, Reaper is incredibly reliable and has taken unexpected delays into account for this KS.   It's not exactly like ordering a product and having it sent through post."

Cthulhu,3dm1kh,MrNameisme,6,Fri Jul 17 10:48:19 2015 UTC,"If you really want a Lovecraft horror game, go for the 'big three' (at least to me):  Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth - The epitome of Lovecraftian games, tells the story of the Escape From Innsmouth module for the Call of Cthulhu tabletop game. Very good atmosphere and in-depth puzzles, but may be necessary to consult a guide or walkthrough. Good sanity system, no HUD whatsoever, gunplay is especially good for realism. Don't have a firearm equipped when your sanity is low enough. You will regret it.   Amnesia: the Dark Descent - Known to be one of the scariest games of all time. Focuses entirely on puzzle solving. Enemies are unstoppable, and drive you insane if you look at them the wrong way (or the right way). Play this game with the lights off and headphones on.   Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem - you'll need Dolphin to play this on PC, but you should play it on GameCube or Wii. The single coolest sanity system in any game. Ever. Neat story too. Combat may be a little clunky.   Honorable mentions include: Eldritch (the game you linked), Sunless Sea, Alone in the Dark, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, They Bleed Pixels"

I usually just pick out a specific author and look for an anthology of their work, or pick up any random ""cthulhu mythos"" collection books. Most generic collections that ive seen will usually have a ton of lovecraft and derleth works, so those might be two good ones to start you off looking for.  Edit: if you're looking for smaller books, look for this particular style/series:  http://www.amazon.com/Tales-Cthulhu-Mythos-H-Lovecraft/dp/034542204X  These usually have like 4-5 short stories in 'em by associated authors (even though it says lovecraft in big letters on the top).

Cthulhu,3b2nkz,tonywartooth,2,Thu Jun 25 15:59:40 2015 UTC,"The game looks interesting, but I have a firm $100 ceiling when it comes to board games. I've looked at the game at gencon and didn't see $200 quality or gameplay in it. I know the price is mainly in the individual pieces but I still think this game could be priced $100 lower and still be profitable."

Cthulhu,3aq5ko,CryoftheBanshee,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:30:56 2015 UTC,I really like Nyarlathotep (though I hate spelling his name) but I don't think of him in this 'monster' category (personal categorization scheme).  He's way too human (or at least seems to think the most human-like).
Cthulhu,3aq5ko,eternaldm,2,Tue Jun 23 15:19:04 2015 UTC,"His faux relatability to humans allowed him to manipulate them, use them, and deliver them to the gods. Plus he has numerous forms he can take."
Cthulhu,3aq5ko,Orgy_In_The_Moonbase,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:36:17 2015 UTC,Agreed.  He just always felt more on the Elder God level rather than the Shoggoth and ghoul level to me.  Possibly one of my favorite villains/antagonists though.
Cthulhu,3aq5ko,krynnmeridia,2,Tue Jun 23 15:53:46 2015 UTC,"Even though he gets placed with the other gods, I'd put him at a sort of demigod status based on his direct interaction and ability to stay among humans while all the others are exiled."
Cthulhu,3aq5ko,Cthulhu_Redux,2,Tue Jun 23 15:58:29 2015 UTC,I think that fits well with my impression of him- and reinforces your 'antichrist' portrayal comments.  I also already used Nyarlathotep in an earlier story in this 'cycle' where he's a DJ.
Cthulhu,3aq5ko,BadgerDancer,3,Tue Jun 23 16:04:01 2015 UTC,"The elder things from the mountains of madness are my personal favourite.  I love the idea of their getting gradually complacent over deep geological time; forgetting the ancient magics even though they're effectively immortal.  Taking impossibly ancient murderous creatures with tentacles and eyestalks and then showcasing them as sympathetically human and helpless in the face of the mythos - that's my jam.  They're also VERY endangered, so it'd work well for the story."

Cthulhu,3aq5ko,Ippsissimus,2,Mon Jun 22 20:55:09 2015 UTC,"Oooh, that's a tough one. I've never actually thought about this one. I'd say it's either Yog-Sothoth or the race from The Whisperer in the Darkness (I am currently blanking on the name right now...). Yog-Sothoth drives the Dunwich Horror.

""Lovecraft was sexually squeamish; would only talk of ‘certain nameless rituals.’ Or he’d use some euphemism: ‘blasphemous rites.’ It was pretty obvious, given that a lot of his stories detailed the inhuman offspring of these ‘blasphemous rituals’ that sex was probably involved somewhere along the line. But that never used to feature in Lovecraft’s stories, except as a kind of suggested undercurrent. So I thought, let’s put all of the unpleasant racial stuff back in, let’s put sex back in. Let’s come up with some genuinely ‘nameless rituals’: let’s give them a name."""
