DoctorWhumour,3e119i,AlienCricket,16,Tue Jul 21 03:18:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, every Doctor should quote the Lion King in their first episode."
DoctorWhumour,3e119i,doctorwhore,10,Tue Jul 21 07:32:13 2015 UTC,No. The Eleventh Hour was done to show we were entering a new era of Doctor Who. Callbacks to the RTD era would not have helped.
DoctorWhumour,3e119i,pottyaboutpotter1,17,Tue Jul 21 09:41:34 2015 UTC,"Yet, he can still complain about not being ginger."
DoctorWhumour,3e119i,Zachisasloth,4,Tue Jul 21 10:19:35 2015 UTC,But that was in a scene written by RTD not Moffat and was in an RTD episode thus it was still part of the RTD era.
DoctorWhumour,3e119i,pottyaboutpotter1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:35:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's entirely true, but I wouldn't have liked this one. In this big moment, the callback would have killed the mood, I think."
DoctorWhumour,3e119i,TheGallifreyan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:00:27 2015 UTC,The Eleventh Hour was written from the ground up to be a reintroduction to the show as its stylistically different to the RTD era. The episode was all about establishing Matt as the Doctor and Moffat as the new writer so they stayed away from RTD and Tennant stuff because of that.
DoctorWhumour,3e119i,pottyaboutpotter1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:45:18 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree. By that logic, no references should be made to any previous doctors who were under a different showrunner (which is almost all of them), because people might not like the current one as much. But different opinions are okay to have, especially in a show that's been running for so long.  A callback line here and there is perfectly acceptable, and in this case could have eased the transition between doctors and showrunners. (""It's not 10 and RTD anymore, but the same humor is still there!"") With almost zero carryover from the RTD era, the beginning of Matt's run felt extremely unlike what we were used to; something small like this could have helped."

DoctorWhumour,3dn830,King_Groovy,5,Fri Jul 17 23:22:09 2015 UTC,I don't either. Fans of this show try to make everything related to something or someone and get super excited over little things.

DoctorWhumour,3dn830,Snorgledork,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:01:51 2015 UTC,That's how I took it. When the Doctor brings it up again in Big Bang he talks about how her house had too many empty rooms. It represents all the odd remnants of things that don't exist anymore for Amy.

My personal favourite which I would love to see more people reference is early on in the episode ""Rings of Akhaten"". The speech The Doctor has at the end of that episode is so filled with emotion and truth and raw energy that it deserves to be recognized.   DOCTOR: Can you hear them? All these people who've lived in terror of you and your judgement? All these people whose ancestors devoted themselves, sacrificed themselves, to you. Can you hear them singing? Oh, you like to thing you're a god. But you're not a god. You're just a parasite eaten out with jealousy and envy and longing for the lives of others. You feed on them. On the memory of love and loss and birth and death and joy and sorrow. So, come on, then. Take mine. Take my memories. But I hope you've got a big appetite, because I have lived a long life and I have seen a few things.  (Energy tendrils reach out to the Doctor.)  DOCTOR: I walked away from the last Great Time War. I marked the passing of the Time Lords. I saw the birth of the universe and I watched as time ran out, moment by moment, until nothing remained. No time. No space. Just me. I walked in universes where the laws of physics were devised by the mind of a mad man. I've watched universes freeze and creations burn. I've seen things you wouldn't believe. I have lost things you will never understand. And I know things. Secrets that must never be told. Knowledge that must never be spoken. Knowledge that will make parasite gods blaze. So come on, then. Take it! Take it all, baby! Have it! You have it all!  (The face on the sun rolls in on itself and releases the Doctor.)"
DoctorWhumour,3b2ixj,Dhread24,4,Thu Jun 25 20:32:02 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love that speech as well, but I think they are two very different speeches.  The Pandorica speech is powerful and cocky, whereas the Akhaten speech has much more of a heart and evokes the love the Doctor has for all creatures, while also reminding us of his loneliness."
DoctorWhumour,3b2ixj,indyK1ng,2,Thu Jun 25 22:05:17 2015 UTC,"The Pandorica speech is powerful and cocky   And that was the point of it.  As the Doctor says later, he got too big and this was the consequence.  How many times before this one did he just have to mention who he was to get the enemies to back off?  Having that sort of reputation has its consequences.  At some point, people will begin to question who is really the villain.  The whole point of the Smith arc which would have been great if he hadn't left, was that you can't keep walking away from adventure after adventure and bragging about it without making enough enemies to look like the bad guy."

And I'm training for a half marathon to occur in October. Thank you Doctor Who!  Edit: what about ""Run like The Doctor""?"

But as far as we got he said that you and your lung would die instantly and I said you could get it amputated and use it as a weapon to get revenge on your killer through honorable lung to hand combat. He then asked how you would live without any lungs in which point I pointed out that I don't know about him but I have two lungs."

In the sight of any living thing, they literally turn to stone. And you can't be saved by a stone. But then you turn your head away, then you blink, and oh yes it can.  Just Blink.

Picture the Rock as being similar to Dwayne Johnson's bounty hunter character in ""The Rundown"": he's going to bring back the Master to face the Timelord Council, no matter where he has to go or what he has to do to get to him.

DoctorWhumour,384729,qt_314159,6,Tue Jun 2 05:06:57 2015 UTC,By human understanding maybe. The TARDIS is theoretically possible provided a high enough level of technology. Just because you can't fathom it doesn't mean it can't happen :D
DoctorWhumour,384729,Cptfailboat104,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:16:40 2015 UTC,I'm not saying that at all. All I've said is that I like the Enterprise better.
DoctorWhumour,384729,ThaDoctahDonna,4,Tue Jun 2 05:21:04 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely a bigger fan of Doctor Who, but the Enterprise is a better ship. Of course the TARDIS is capable of more functions, is more powerful, etc... but from a first glance, the Enterprise is much more intimidating. Unless you know what the TARDIS actually is,no one is going to be impressed. Also, how much of the TARDIS do we really see? Not much. We know of only some of the functions of the many different rooms, but we rarely see them. And how may people get to be inside the TARDIS? Not many. The Enterprise (and any other Starfleet ship for that manner) is open to nearly anyone. The functions and places of the ship are very prevalent in most of the episodes (the Halodeck, Ten Forward, etc...) and we see how the crew interacts with the ship itself. The Enterprise explores many planets and cultures that welcome the strange visitors, but the aliens are welcome aboard (in most cases) the Enterprise as well, in the form of ambassadors and other travelers."
DoctorWhumour,384729,Cptfailboat104,0,Tue Jun 2 08:55:18 2015 UTC,That is NOT all you've said.   95% of the tech in the Enterprise is actually creatable.   This implies that a portion of the technology in the TARDIS isn't able to be created. I assume that it's a larger portion than the tech that's on the Enterprise because your statement wouldn't have a purpose if that weren't the case.  You are saying that the TARDIS is less possible than the Enterprise.

DoctorWhumour,384729,Lightningdrake99,2,Tue Jun 2 05:13:44 2015 UTC,"Even if you take that at face value, notice the part where he says ""I can reduce the negative energy needed""  Basically, all warp drive concepts start by assuming there's ""exotic matter"" that can have ""negative energy"" that we have no real reason to think exists, except that they can maybe make the math work out."
DoctorWhumour,384729,Cptfailboat104,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:16:22 2015 UTC,"actually you're misrepresenting that. Warp cores use matter and anti-matter to produce energy and use dilithium(or trilithium later) crystals to somehow regulate the reaction. While Anti-matter is very rare it exists.   The negative energy aspect of it refers to an effect of black holes that we only know about through our remote measuring of them. It's been a huge debate over whether or not black holes destroy information, but there are theories that they can create an environment that contains negative energy.   Since warp drives, black holes, and worm holes seem to be in the same sphere of activity it's not strange to hear about negative energy when discussing warp engines."

Iconography, advertising and brand recognition of article  Castlemaine XXXX:       XXXX's mascot is Mr Fourex - a jovial cartoon man in a suit with a boater hat, who features on the City side of the Fourex Brewery at Milton and is to be re-introduced into advertising in the near future for the first time since 1967. Mr Fourex is said to be modelled after Paddy Fitzgerald, a former director of the company, however Mr Fourex had been conceived in 1924, and Fitzgerald started with XXXX only in circa 1933.  A second theory is that the cartoon is modelled on a well-known dwarf who sold newspapers in the inner city suburb of Fortitude Valley in the late 1920s. The true identity for the inspiration behind the cartoon remains a mystery.       Interesting: Lion (Australasian company) | Pumpkin Island   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

(Eleventh Hour)  YOU! ARE! MY! ENEMY! And I am yours! You are everything I despise. The worst thing in all creation. I've defeated you. Time and time again, I've defeated you. I sent you back into the Void, I saved the whole of reality from you. I AM THE DOCTOR AND YOU ARE THE DALEKS! (Victory of the Daleks)  Didn't anyone ever tell you? There's one thing you never put in a trap. If you're smart, if you value your continued existence, if you have any plans about seeing tomorrow, there's one thing you never, ever put in a trap. Me. (The Time of Angels)  Hello, Stonehenge! Who takes the Pandorica, takes the universe! But bad news, everyone, 'cause guess who! Ha! Listen, you lot! You're all whizzing about; it's really very distracting. Could you all just stay still a minute, because I! AM! TALKING! Now, the question of the hour is, ""Who's got the Pandorica?"" Answer: I do. Next question: Who's coming to take it from me? [Pause] Come on! Look at me! No plan, no plan, no back-up, no weapons worth a damn! Oh, and something else, I don't have anything to lose! So, if you're sitting up there in your silly, little spaceship with all your silly, little guns, and you've got any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight, just remember who's standing in your way! Remember every black day I ever stopped you, and then, and then, do the smart thing: Let somebody else try first. (Pandorica)   And that's just Series 5."

DoctorWhumour,32tpm4,_quicksand,72,Fri Apr 17 01:49:29 2015 UTC,"Everyone says Eccleston was the darkest Doctor, and Smith was a lighthearted happy go lucky Doctor. I can't remember where I read it, but if you look, it's completely backwards. Nine had hope. He gave second chances. He wanted to help. He didn't want anyone else to have to die. Even his enemies. Ten no longer gave second chances. He'd help, but if you crossed him, he'd throw you into a the event horizon of a black hole. Eleven may appear to be all nonsense and childishness, but he's exceptionally dark. He doesn't care anymore. Killing is no longer a bother to him. He does it casually. And then he laughs. He's lost all patience with his enemies and even his ""friends"". He covers all this up with humor. Don't let that fool you."

It's very clear his childishness is a cover for a very dark man. Most of Smith's episodes are written to call him out on this. Amy's Choice was pratically screaming ""You think you know this Doctor... but you don't."" Many more showed he had a dark side, darker than 10's."

I don't really dislike Smith before that, but god I just LOVE him in S07B and the Trilogy of the Doctor."
DoctorWhumour,32tpm4,TheToto1000,25,Fri Apr 17 10:47:31 2015 UTC,Matt Smith had one of the most emotionally driven runs. Everything done was from the heart. Such a heavy role to play and he hit every corner of the role doing it. Definitely up there with Tennant in my book.

Never could get into Eleven...but I don't think it was the Doctor or actor, it was just the change in writing direction. RTDs era was much more character driven, and Moffat's more plot driven, and character development has  always been what I value most in a story--so Eleven's episodes always left me feeling unfulfilled :-/     But again, that's just me..."

Keep in mind a good amount of kids in UK are watching this and instead of a doctor they don't really understand, they got this loveable happy doctor who seems like fun. I wasn't at first a fan and his will never be my favorite seasons but I do enjoy the whimsical aspect he brings to the role."
DoctorWhumour,32tpm4,anidealistmind,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:40:04 2015 UTC,Agreed. It is a kids show after all.

Smith : GREAT portrayal of an ancient creature trying to stay young. Capaldi : Excellent version of the Doctor wrapped in darkness. Tennant : the Anti-Doctor.  At best, spoiled 10 year old, at worst the Master's playdate."
DoctorWhumour,32tpm4,ThePenguinofTime,5,Fri Apr 17 14:31:49 2015 UTC,(For the updated series) the first couple episodes are pretty corny and if its a new doctor its just getting to know his quirks and attitude of life. You cannot fairly judge Smith if you have not watched how he has grown and the amazing things he accomplished. You have to finish it. So worth your time.. I promise.

DoctorWhumour,32tpm4,Bottled_Void,2,Thu Apr 16 20:22:09 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched the original series- some are on Netflix, but not all of them so I feel like it's just a bit odd to watch just a random four episodes from a season.....  So keeping in mind I've only watched Nine, Ten, and Eleven- I think they all did really well.  I think each one was able to show the different sides of the Doctor: the pain, the brilliance, and the desire to forget the pain of the past.  Every regeneration is rocky for me because, as Ten says:    Even then, even if I change, it feels like dying. Everything I am dies. Some new man goes sauntering away... and I'm dead.   I feel like the first three episodes with a new Doctor I'm still mourning the old.  If you haven't watched many of the episodes with Matt Smith and want to try to see his less childish side, I suggest The Doctor's Wife (season 6, episode 4); A Good Man Goes to War (season 6, episode 7); The God Complex (season 6, episode 11); or Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS (season 7, episode 11).  The Beast Below; The Pandorica Opens / The Big Bang; The Wedding of River Song; and The Name of the Doctor are also good, but that first list shows the deadly serious interior beneath the childish exterior.  Regardless, I'm sure Capaldi will bring a whole new face, so you'll have that to see soon enough.  [[edit: formatting]]"

He does get much more badass when he stays in the parallel universe and starts kicking cyberman ass"
DoctorWhumour,30q0b4,deadhead1,11,Sun Mar 29 19:13:44 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling that the Doctor's mind works way differently from ours.  He was already subconciously familiar with Rose from the events towards the end of the War Doctor's life, even if he didn't directly remember the events and all through the first few episodes he keeps giving Mickey nicknames.  ""Mickey the Idiot"" and ""Ricky"".  Of course, ""Mickey the Idiot"" is a reference to the conversation the Doctor eventually has with Mickey after he helps save the world from the Slitheen.  In that chat, Mickey jokingly refers to the human race as a bunch of idiots and the Doctor retorts ""Not all of you"", clearly saying ""Mickey the Idiot"" is a thing of the past.  It's after this that Mickey realizes he's not ready to start traveling on the TARDIS just yet (he does after the Doctor regenerates).  However the clearest indication the Doctor had some sort of strange pre-knowledge of Mickey's fate was his constant ""Ricky insult"", which turned out to be foreshadowing to the episode where Mickey indeed finds out he belongs in a parallel universe under the name Ricky.  This isn't the only time the Doctor has displayed odd foreknowledge of events, but it's one of the clearest times that his special skill ended up being more than just a storytelling device."
DoctorWhumour,30q0b4,alsorobots,3,Sun Mar 29 20:09:16 2015 UTC,"I like your theory but I felt like the ""Ricky"" thing was just a  comedic element though you may be right as well."
DoctorWhumour,30q0b4,somenonewho,13,Sun Mar 29 21:29:45 2015 UTC,"honestly I always just kinda felt bad for him. Try to see it from his angle.  You're dating this girl. You really like her, even though you're a bit of a loser, she's dating you, and you guys get along really well. Things seem to be going great!  Then one day, your girlfriend's work blows up and she becomes obsessed with some guy you've never heard of. Who calls himself ""the doctor"" anyway? So because you love her, you drive her to some weirdo's house so she can learn more about this guy, right? But you get captured by a goddamn trash can and nearly killed. Thankfully, your girlfriend saves you, but who the hell is that guy with her? What the hell is going on?  Then out of nowhere, this weird guy in a stupid blue box offers to take your girlfriend to outer space and leave you, confused and scared, to pick up the pieces of your shattered mind after all the shit that's happened. Luckily, she declines and you breathe a sigh of relief, only to have him fucking DISAPPEAR and reappear seconds later telling you his box is a goddamn time machine. WHAT THE FUCK.  So your girlfriend, who you thought was really into you, DISAPPEARS FOR A GODDAMN YEAR, leaving you to be arrested and questioned with her disappearance and possible murder by the fucking police. Who's gonna believe you that she's traveling through time? What if she's dead? What if you imagined that and went insane? Oh, but no, she does eventually show up the day Big Ben is hit with a fucking space ship all like, ""lol, no, idiot. I'm okay. What's wrong with you?"" Oh yeah, and then the guy who kidnapped her wants you to help blow up Downing street. And when they're done with you? Off into the time machine again without you and off to god knows where, only to even let you know they're alive when they need you to drive to fucking Cardiff from London for some shit they need, not even because your supposed girlfriend even wants to see you. The only reason they call YOU is because they know they'll get what they need without having to deal with your girlfriend's bitchy mum.  So no, I don't think Mickey is a whiny little bitch. I think he's mostly just confused and taken advantage of. If any of that stuff happened to any of you, would you not be whining, too?"
DoctorWhumour,30q0b4,trainercatlady,5,Sun Mar 29 23:45:40 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I'm not the guy to ask this. I've always wanted my friends and lovers to do what's best for them, even if it's not great for me.   She's traveling all over the universe seeing amazing things and he just wants her to stay at home, work in a shop, and go to hotels with him for the night.   While I'll admit his jealousy of The Doctor confuses things, it's really hard to tell her to ""just give it up."""
DoctorWhumour,30q0b4,dankman13,2,Sun Mar 29 23:57:56 2015 UTC,Then it's just a case of bad writing where the whole tension between her and mickey would be resolved with a simple conversation. Also a conversation with her mother so she doesn't call the police on him.

Rose Tyler knew her as ""Trisha from the shop"". Mickey Smith claimed to have started going out with her when Rose was gone for long periods of time with the Ninth Doctor. Rose, however, knowing the two of them and thinking ""that's never gonna happen"", thought Mickey was using Trisha to get back at her, and that ""It's got nothing to do with Trisha."" Nonetheless, when Rose returned to 21st century Earth in the TARDIS and ""pick[...] up the phone"", Mickey said he came running for Rose and would ""sit here for the rest of [his] life waiting"" for her.

If the Silence looks away, the Angel is free to attack, since them looking at you has nothing to do with making you forget.   However, in an encounter,  the Silence would have the advantage, since it would be free to move behind the Angel and make the Angel forget. Though if it was unaware of what the Angel was, it might ignore it and look away."

DoctorWhumour,30g0sd,darkplane13,9,Fri Mar 27 01:54:59 2015 UTC,Yeah you are right. Just because the silence looks away does not mean the angel forgets. It is only if the angel looks away then the angel will forget. It was a simple answer but I couldn't wrap my head around it when I read it.
DoctorWhumour,30g0sd,TheWill2Live,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:22:06 2015 UTC,The better way to do this is if a silence turns the corner. Then he's out of sight and looking away.
