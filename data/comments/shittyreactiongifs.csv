shittyreactiongifs,3dye7f,alex_dlc,2,Tue Jul 21 12:44:59 2015 UTC,I own ducks and daily rapes are a regular thing here. They grab the female by the neck and pin her down. It's awful. Had two killed by a gang bang. Chickens are no better. We will have 5 roosters lined up waiting to take a turn with a  poor hen. Farm life is brutal when you learn what happens behind the scenes.

The holy hand grenade scene probably being my favorite because of how well they captured the writing style of the bible (not just its verbosity, but its use of chiastic structures and language)"
shittyreactiongifs,3dye7f,needuhLee,47,Mon Jul 20 20:54:26 2015 UTC,I think Life of Brian is pretty hilarious as well
shittyreactiongifs,3dye7f,Khalexus,27,Mon Jul 20 21:47:58 2015 UTC,"Now that I think of it, I think there are a lot of solid scenes in Life of Brian as well. Biggus Dickus, and Always Look on the Bright Side of Life were probably the high lights for me.  I don't know, just a lot of the scenes in Life of Brian I would get the joke and everything, but viscerally I would not find it funny.  On the other hand, listening to Palin talk about people rejoicing and eating breakfast cereals in his ridiculous preacher boy voice was fucking hilarious to me.  That said, I'm much more familiar with that time period/subject matter than that of Life of Brian, so that could definitely be a factor. A lot of their humor is surprisingly deep."

shittyreactiongifs,3dls1f,PutinPetsPandas,9,Fri Jul 17 23:08:49 2015 UTC,"History records little of these events because cats have no written language but during the Livonian Crusades of the 13th Century, when the Teutonic Knights where burning Pagan Estonian and Latvian heathens, their cats (a great source of magic to the Pagans) would be clubbed to death with whatever agricultural products happened to be laying around in accordance with Pope Honorius III's decree that sword should never slay the magic cats, for their blood would taint God's Blessing upon The Order. Cucumbers where a phallic symbol important to Pagan mysticism and therefore plentiful inside Pagan huts and yurts.   From that day forward, cat mythology and oral history have taught their young that if they misbehave, a hoomon will ""present the Green Dirt Penis of Death"" as a warning of what may come if the behavior continues.   Leading atheist cats of modern thinking like to test this myth by knocking over shit or by bellowing at 3 AM. Ergo, if your cat is an ass, he is just a philosopher who likes to disprove The Cucumber.   THANK YOU FOR SUBSCRIBING TO SHITTY CAT FACTS. TEXT 18%JKÄÅÖ§ TO UNSUBSCRIBE."

shittyreactiongifs,3d9l31,SgtSlaughterEX,36,Tue Jul 14 18:22:25 2015 UTC,"Archer is an American adult animated television series created by Adam Reed for the FX network. A preview of the series aired on September 17, 2009.[3] The first season premiered on January 14, 2010.[4] The show completed airing its sixth season on April 2, 2015, and has been renewed for a seventh season, to consist of 13 episodes.[5] The show carries a TV-MA rating.  The inspiration for Archer came to Reed while in a cafe in Salamanca, Spain. Finding himself unable to approach a beautiful woman seated nearby, Reed conjured up the idea of a spy who ""would have a perfect line"".[6] Reed conceived the show's concept while walking along the Vía de la Plata in 2008.[7] He pitched his idea to FX, which accepted it and ordered six episodes, along with an additional four scripts.[8]  Archer[edit] Set at ISIS, the International Secret Intelligence Service in New York City, suave and profoundly self-centered master spy Sterling Archer deals with global espionage; his domineering, emotionally distant mother and boss, Malory Archer; his now ex-girlfriend (and fellow ISIS operative), Lana Kane; and his other ISIS co-workers (including fellow operative Ray Gillette, accountant Cyril Figgis, Human Resources Director Pam Poovey, dimwitted secretary Cheryl Tunt, and Applied Research head Doctor Krieger); as well as a code name: ""Duchess"" (after his mother's deceased Afghan Hound).[9]"

Nobody had anything. People were living on Facebook... posting shit their grandma sent them. This chick had memes, she was begging me to post em. So I told her I wasn't going to be Joe the post man anymore, but I would take a little bit and post it for my close, close, close friends. She agreed to that, said we'd keep the same arrangement as before; 10%, free dank for me, as long as I helped her out that weekend. She had a brick of dank memes she was posting, she didn't want to go to the web alone. Her brother usually posts with her, but he's in county unexpectedly."

No idea why nobody can fix it, because there are 20 people sharing one shitter and one urinal (all males).  So one day, it was a particularly busy dumper day, everyone, in and out all day it seemed.  I finally got my chance, so i go in, plop a squat.  3 times in the next 5 minutes, I can hear someone come in, see the stall is occupied, and huff and puff as they turn around and walk out.  A couple minutes later, the door opens again, and it's my boss.  I hear him say, ""oh fuck it, I'm going to figure out why this other toilet doesn't work.""  I hadn't shit yet, and was feeling a little constipated, but my tummy was really rumbling.  Kinda strange.  Boss man is in there messing with the other toilet, and i give it a really big push.  It felt like a cannon shooting one big round turd out of my ass, followed by a barrage of shotgun blasts.  And it was the worst smelling shit I've ever had in my life, by far.  It's so bad, I'm dry heaving, trying not to throw up from the smell.  I hear the boss next door start dry heaving.  Hmmmm, hmmm, hmmm... bluuuuuuuuuugh, he fucking let's it go, vomits into the toilet that doesn't work!  Probably my proudest moment ever."

shittyreactiongifs,3coebn,doneitnow,0,Thu Jul 9 17:56:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's shittyness almost insists too much upon itself.  A good shitty gif contains atleast one element of the gifs original intention so that when the subversion of its theme occurs it's more unexpected.  Also this gif isn't well known which takes away the factor of seeing intentions warped to satisfy the title. I give this shitty gif 6/10. It's a shitty gif like ramen noodles is a shitty dinner. Not like how pizza is a ""Shitty""  dinner."

You use layers, instead of tracks, and you use the pen tool to mask things, like in Photoshop. Like Premiere, you apply effects to clips, and you apply keyframes in the same way as well. It might be a little overwhelming at first, but I'd say once you understand it, there's a nice, consistent logic to everything. It's really my favorite program because so much makes sense, and only rarely when I wonder ""can I do that?"" is the answer ""no."""

shittyreactiongifs,3cf6cu,Typrix,14,Tue Jul 7 15:45:17 2015 UTC,Back in '97 I had a CS professor predicting we'd be using SaaS at the OS level by now.

shittyreactiongifs,3cf6cu,not-done,7,Tue Jul 7 15:59:37 2015 UTC,Their subscription model actually makes it affordable for some people though. Instead of shelling out hundreds to thousands for a single app you now pay just $10/mth for Photoshop + Lightroom. If you're a student you get a massive discount for their entire suite as well (10+ full fledged apps). In the past people would just pirate since there's no way they're going to pay $1000 for an app for personal use but now going legit is actually viable.
shittyreactiongifs,3cf6cu,nofapfever,7,Tue Jul 7 16:35:33 2015 UTC,"Right... but that's $10/mo perpetually. You have to commit to that monthly payment for as long as you want to use the product. Before, you'd pay X and you'd have it for as long as you had the install, really. No internet, no problem, hit hard financial times? so what, you already paid for it, you're good.   If you were the type to be upgrading every time they release a new version (every few years), it's cheaper, but if you were the type to skip a few versions it's less affordable than it used to be. To me it's really telling that they straight-up only allow the subscription, rather than having it only as an option."
shittyreactiongifs,3cf6cu,r4nd0md0od,6,Tue Jul 7 16:57:35 2015 UTC,"It's still really easy to pirate though, if the problems you mentioned earlier are the main concerns. Basically it makes it easier for people who are serious about going legit to do so while people who don't won't bother to begin with."
shittyreactiongifs,3cf6cu,themindset,6,Tue Jul 7 17:01:18 2015 UTC,"Haha, maybe I don't want to pirate. I don't think that's a great solution. I'd just buy a license if I could. Photoshop has never been something I used professionally, so the monthly rental fee is not worth it to me as a hobbyist. I still get mileage out of cs6, though, which I'm not going to get locked out of for missing a $10 payment."
shittyreactiongifs,3cf6cu,NaughtyHobby,3,Tue Jul 7 17:39:43 2015 UTC,I think they aren't taking piracy too seriously because they want Adobe products to remain the de facto standard and that's easier when more people use the product.

shittyreactiongifs,3cf6cu,squngy,52,Tue Jul 7 14:51:05 2015 UTC,It's easier for basic consumers to pay $10 a month for i.e. Photoshop rather than paying a $2k flat price.
shittyreactiongifs,3cf6cu,bigredone15,23,Tue Jul 7 14:55:19 2015 UTC,"The flat price was good for Adobe, because so many people cracked the suite and used Photoshop for free, that companies kept using it as well. It was, and still is, the go-to for shopping. This is comparable to how Hilfiger allowed his products to be stolen from shops near ghettos (stores were instructed not to hinder thiefs), because when the ""cool"" folks wear your brand on the street, it becomes ""hot"" and everybody else (who will actually buy it) wants it too."

Uncontroversial, reliably successful, and so it gets popular. Only Kenneth Branagh would think to subject people to 4 hours of Hamlet in the comfort of their own home. That worked back in the day because you were fucking standing up the whole time so you couldn't really fall asleep, and there is an intermission so you can renew your buzz"

He then picked up the child of a deceased victim and whispered into her ear ""Your dad's dead, bitch"", and proceeded to put on a pair of sunglasses and unleash a barrage of martial arts attack on the small child. She was rushed to the hospital where she was pronounced dead due to extreme trauma.

This species co-exists with the Bornean Orangutan.  It belongs in the monotypic genus Nasalis, although the pig-tailed langur has traditionally also been included in this genus.   The monkey also goes by the Malay name monyet belanda (""Dutch monkey""), or even orang belanda (""Dutchman""), as Indonesians remarked that the Dutch colonisers often had similarly large bellies and noses.  This species of monkey is easily identifiable because of its unusually large nose.

Eventually, the gravity at your feet is so much greater than the gravity at your head, that your body breaks into two - likely at the waist area. Then, those two pieces of you experience the same thing that your once-full self just did, and they break.  The cycle repeats itself until you're a string of atoms floating forever down into the abyss.  To someone outside of that frame of reference, you'll appear to all of a sudden stop moving/floating, and you'll slowly grow more red and eventually fade away as that red goes infrared.  You however will begin to see the back of your own head regardless of where you look, because the light is being warped by the immense gravity of the black hole."

shittyreactiongifs,3bptdi,rhetoricles,2,Thu Jul 2 03:57:14 2015 UTC,"Slacklining:       Slacklining is the use of a form of webbing that is tensioned between two anchor points to balance. Slacklining is similar to slack rope walking and tightrope walking as the line is held under tension. Slacklining differs from either tightwires or tightropes in that it is only tensioned to a point that creates a more dynamic line which has a degree of stretch and bounce making like a long and narrow trampoline. The line's tension can be adjusted to suit the user, and different types of webbing can be used to achieve a variety of tricks. The line itself is flat, due to the nature of webbing. Slacklining has quickly become popular due to its simplicity and versatility and its ability to be practiced in a variety of environments.
