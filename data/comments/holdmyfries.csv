Props to him for beeing a decent human beeing though and not going full hamplanet of the apes-shit on the guy loosening his straps.

You would have thought the five-point harness would accomplish that task, but obviously it turns into a guillotine when applied to individuals rated too short and too large for it.  Pure negligence of training from the staff for letting him ride this (and not securing under code), pure negligence of the parents (for letting him eat his way into this predicament), and Janice is a psycho (bitch is crazy)."

I have no idea why this sub is still alive, but I assume it isn't large/active enough. FPH was nearly 15 times as big as this sub subscriber-wise, and the activity here is therefore a lot lower than it was on FPH. Also, FPH would make the front page every now and then, and I have yet to see HMF on the front page.    The other 4 subreddits were also smaller and less active, but those were banned just to make FPH's banning look less suspicious. At least now they can try to make a claim that banning FPH was part of some greater plan to clean up Reddit, even though we all know that's BS."

If that was the case, this doesn't really reflect the level of the shame and humiliation that most certainly came when the actual attempt at jumping onto the box took place. I'd like to see the more realistic consequence of her legs buckling under her enormous girth as she proceeds to test just how much impact her bloated skin can take from falling to the ground. Will she explode from the sudden pressure to her exterior? Will the skin only split in a few places? Or, will the tight clothing that's desperately attempting to hold her rolls together simply be destroyed and snap off upon her hitting the ground and forcefully impacting her incalculable mass? We would all be blinded by the traumatic sight of her nudity of course."

Unless you're looking to get punch drunk, there's no reason not to tap out the second he's out of your hold. The fight is over.

holdmyfries,32t83q,bryanrobh,6,Thu Apr 16 18:33:32 2015 UTC,"Look, nothing is binary. If the caloric surplus is only, say, 300 kcal a day, it is possible to out-lift that. If it is 3000 then obviously not.  I think I get what you mean -  a lot of people are basically addicts to fast food or sweets or soda, and that always leads to a huge caloric surplus.  However there are people who have only smaller dietary sins. White bread based breakfast, two beers in the evenings, things like that, a small surplus. It is possible to out-exercise that, although, of course, changing the diet too is more efficient. Still, on the whole more active people can afford to cut themselves more slack."
holdmyfries,32t83q,BhiQ,3,Mon Apr 20 02:48:10 2015 UTC,"You're right - it's not truly a binary if you consider all people.  But you also guessed it - I wasn't talking about active people with healthy body weight/composition whose diets need minor improvements.  If you're fit and active, you can easily burn 300kcal/day by exercise.  When I was on swim team I was probably burning closer to 1700kcal/day in the pool.  But a 325lb morbidly obese person is simply not going to be capable of doing that much exercise.  Swim 6km in 2 hours?  No way in hell.  Run a mile without stopping?  Forget it.  Walk 2 miles in under an hour?  Not fucking likely.  Also, regarding lifting in particular, it doesn't directly burn very many calories at all compared to prolonged aerobic exercise, so even a fit person might have trouble burning more than a few hundred kcal/day just by lifting."

Some make it way too difficult or slow to change speed (because I dont want to do my 30-second flat-out sprint for 40 seconds), and I've seen some that just dont like to respond to input. I've even used one where you can't further adjust speed while its accelerating or decelerating; if you change it again, the treadmill says ""Oh, you didn't want the speed you just set? Well I'll just cancel everything and go back to the speed I had before!"" That absolutely sucks when speed is controlled only by arrow buttons.  Listen up fitness equipment designers.

holdmyfries,2yzd8q,FPH_Shitlord,47,Sat Mar 14 17:20:10 2015 UTC,I hate crossfit so much.  It's all lies.  No form.  No safety.  Every plate is the size of a 45. All of them.  Crossfit is the HAES of lifting. All of the feelings-coddling and none of the hard work.
holdmyfries,2yzd8q,RobVegas,16,Sat Mar 14 05:05:49 2015 UTC,I'm with you except for the part about the plates. Bumper plates are legit. They're great when doing things like heavy cleans or deadlifts where you may want to just dump the bar after a heavy lift. They're rugged and won't damage.
holdmyfries,2yzd8q,FPH_Shitlord,3,Sat Mar 14 21:43:59 2015 UTC,"Also, for deadlifting the bar must be mid-shin. If you are weak, it is awkward to use small plates and then try to pile plats under it for height and it keeps falling off and shit like that. I don't lift anymore, but when I did, life sucked until I could deadlift 70 kg (about 155 lbs) without lower back pain. That because 20 kg bar and two 25kg plates which are the biggest in average fitness gyms of Europe. Some just have 20 kg and that makes it hard to deadlift."
holdmyfries,2yzd8q,RobVegas,-12,Fri Apr 3 11:20:18 2015 UTC,"If you're doing heavy cleans, you do them with proper 45s, not 10s that are the same dimensions as 45s."
holdmyfries,2yzd8q,KeepItClassySanDiego,12,Sat Mar 14 21:44:57 2015 UTC,"I'll use bumper 45's and 25's and throw regular irons on after that. The bumpers will absorb the shock and protect the irons.   To be clear, I do believe crossfitters use those smaller plates to make themselves feel like they're lifting bigger than they are because they look big on the bar. But I refuse to allow bumper plates to be relegated only to the crossfit domain."

holdmyfries,2yzd8q,shitlordina,7,Sun Mar 15 09:26:36 2015 UTC,"Feccccking hell, what the fuck is that pull up thing? I've seen fish do better pull ups.   Ok, so I'm still using the machine to do assisted ones right now, but I'm working hard to make sure that I can do them with proper form before rushing into unassisted pull ups."
holdmyfries,2yzd8q,rinzler83,3,Sun Mar 15 09:35:19 2015 UTC,They are kipping pull ups which are bullshit push-ups. A girl I'm dating does crossfit and got all excited when she told me she would start doing pull ups from a dead hang. I told her why not just do 5 real pull ups instead of 15 sloppy ass ones.  Keep using that machine. You'll have good form and eventually won't have to use it.
holdmyfries,2yzd8q,shitlordina,2,Sun Mar 15 09:37:45 2015 UTC,"This is my hope.   It's disheartening, I've been using it for nearly a month now and it doesn't feel like it'll ever get any easier."

It just takes time. It will take more than a month. If you want to see how far you've come,maybe when you do your first pull up with the machine assisting you,have it help you with less weight then before. Like right now if it's helping you by taking 20 pounds off,maybe have the machine help you by only taking 10 pounds off. Just do 1 rep of that just so you can see. Then go back to where you wear originally so you can finish your sets."

holdmyfries,2x27wu,obeasesnowflake,27,Wed Feb 25 17:24:51 2015 UTC,I notice this all time. Anytime a fatty sits down/stands up/falls down/rolls over/ect. Basically anytime they move they are tugging on their shirt to adjust it.   The thing that makes it so cringey is whenever I see a video of a fatty fall down its the very first thing they do. Immediately pull on their shirt to cover their fat. This leads me to believe they are truly ashamed of their body and don't want to expose it for a second.

holdmyfries,2wm1gu,sw1ff,33,Mon Mar 16 22:32:59 2015 UTC,This better be number one because of her reaction after all 2000 pounds lands on her ankle.

holdmyfries,2wm1gu,hkygoalie30,13,Tue Mar 17 00:05:25 2015 UTC,Tears of a whale. I bet the injury to her pride hurt more.

holdmyfries,2wm1gu,Konekotoujou,73,Sat Feb 21 06:57:08 2015 UTC,Looks like she possibly tore a hamstring.
holdmyfries,2wm1gu,naaate129,18,Sat Feb 21 01:43:48 2015 UTC,I know she tore something I vaguely remember it being her acl though.
holdmyfries,2wm1gu,Achtung_Shitl0rd,19,Sat Feb 21 02:30:46 2015 UTC,Judging by the way her knee goes out on the landing I would bet it is an ACL tear. Tore mine completely a month ago and I remember watching my leg bend that exact same way.
