gamecollecting,3e2n47,ALLKAPS,4,Tue Jul 21 15:06:04 2015 UTC,"I always tell my husband that as long as we can 1) pay all of our bills on time 2) eat comfortably, like not rice and pasta everyday, which we have done in the past and 3) I can buy things that I want when I want them without worrying too much (mostly games too, I admit) - then he can spend his money on what he wants to spend it on. And with games, I would be okay with that because I like games too. :D   But yeah, on the other hand 800 total is a big chunk of change to drop all at once. Still, this total haul is pretty mindblowing."
gamecollecting,3e2n47,Jade_GL,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:14:18 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, the collection is easily worth 7-8000... If I didn't hoard games like a dragon hordes gold, there would be an instant return on profit."

gamecollecting,3dzkbq,ShengKingdom,2,Tue Jul 21 02:07:55 2015 UTC,I'm not sure about in other states but in FL you pick a plan (In my daughters case 4 years at a FL state University) and then they calculate the current price for that plan and you lock in that price (I believe it was $35k total).  Depending on how old your child is they then divide that amount by into monthly payments until your child is 18.  Pretty simple and it is a good plan if you think the cost of college is going to continue to rise.

We've already got one!""), this is a promotional crystal for Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon.  I've been looking for one of these bad boys for a fairly long time.  Originally, there were 5 crystals revealed to be made and 4 were given out by Nintendo as a prize, but recently it was confirmed that Gamestop's upper management were given a handful, and they rewarded store managers that sold the most copies of Shadow Dragon or something like that.  I really wanted one of these, because I have no self control when it comes to shiny things, light up things, and laser etched things, and this was all three!  Also I love Fire Emblem.  Story  In a series of ridiculous events, I found that one certain well respected user over on NintendoAge had one months ago, but I ended up passing as I thought his price was too high.  A few weeks later, I was simultaneously messaged on NintendoAge by the owner offering to drop his price, and on here where a user asked me where I knew someone had one of those crystals, as he was willing to pay the original asking price.  I checked reddit first.  (You can probably guess what happened).  That redditor ended up buying another one of these crystals as he wanted the box the crystal came in, and ended up selling this one to me, for a grand total of $206.    Moar stuff  I couldn't take a fancy group shot with my other stuff due to renovations, but here's my other Fire Emblem stuff to display it with: outdated shot of most of my collection, my other addition on my new bookcase :)    TL;DR:: Couldn't find low print shiny object for a long time, finally found shiny object (and at a reasonable price!), this is shiny object!    Edit:  Just noticed the picture focus is not on the damn crystal...  Thank god my photography loving family doesn't reddit, I'd probably be disowned (sorry!)"

I recently posted an add on a local classified site looking for old games as a total shot in the dark. Wasn't expecting to get much back as there are multiple ads on the same site from different people looking for old games. Today I got an email from someone saying that had an old Xbox and games they were wanting to sell. They didn't tell me what they had just that they had more than 10 games, a working console and 2 controllers. When I asked how much they wanted for everything they had and they said $35 (Canadian btw) I figured I didn't have much to lose so I went for it. Most of them are complete with instructions and the console itself is in good shape. One of the controllers is a GameStop brand one and the other ones joysticks are a bit worn but all in all I think I did pretty good here.

As of right now people are importing them here but they go for 50-100 per console and even common games are 15+ dollars.
gamecollecting,3dyrm4,rebmon,2,Tue Jul 21 10:22:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sometimes I emulate the expensive games if they aren't available on another console, but if it's feasible to own the original hardware that is what I do. So I do understand why you emulate, but I try not to."

I also have 3DO and have played a lot of Atari 2600 though I don't own one. I probably haven't played just about every other console.  EDIT: A comment below reminded me of the Genesis add-ons.
