Captain Nemo, for those who don't know him, is a brilliant engineer and a brutal anti-hero. He has devoted his life to battling colonial injustices, often resorting to heavy violence. Here, a belligerent sailor approaches him dressed and armed with Nemo's own mechanical designs. In the novel, the sailors are armed with a fictional 'electric' gun. The gun fires a small glass ball via compressed air. The ""Leyden Ball"" as it is called is filled with static electricity. The target is electrified and killed. It works both on land and underwater."

ImaginaryInteriors,2s6592,SobanSa,6,Mon Jan 12 15:16:26 2015 UTC,"Luke looked around the small bay as he landed. Artoo's concerned vocalizations did not need a translation. ""I'll be ok Artoo. Business as usual."" The two storm troopers waiting with their blasters served as a reminder that this was not actually business as usual.  Popping the cockpit, Luke climbed down the ladder. He felt more then saw the imperial commander behind him. Luke turned to see a small man with an impeccable uniform. He was flanked by the two Stormtroopers. ""Commander Skywalker I presume?"" He said formally, extending his hand. Luke took it, their hands shaking. ""That's me."" He tried to smile, but the last time he had seen stormtroopers they had been trying to shoot him. Their relaxed posture did not relax him.  ""Welcome to the Inevitable. The captain and you have much to discuss. If you want, we will refuel your starfighter and hook it into the ship's charging system.""  Luke was unsure if he should take this offer. However, he figured that artoo could watch the ship. Besides, there was no way for the droid to safely get down from there at the moment. ""Certainly, my Artoo will oversee the connection."" He said.  The Impeial commander nodded to some techs and turned to lead Luke to the bridge. The Captain was a huge man, but old, he turned giving Luke Skywalker a curious look. ""Commander Skywalker, it's good to see you. I trust you have the proof I asked for?""  Luke nodded, reaching for his lightsaber and igniting it. ""This is what you wanted to see?"" He asked before deactivating it again.  The captain looked at the blade fascinated. ""I wanted to make sure you were who you were rumored to be. I served with your father during the clone wars."" He took the code cylanders from his pocket and handed them to Luke. ""The Inevitable, it's officers, and crew have now officially defected to the Rebel Alliance."""

They were used probably from the 5th century onward, recording Old English and Old Frisian.  They remained in use in Anglo-Saxon England throughout the 6th to 10th centuries, although runic script became increasingly confined to manuscript tradition as a topic of antiquarian interest after the 9th century, and it disappeared even as a learned curiosity soon after the Norman conquest.
