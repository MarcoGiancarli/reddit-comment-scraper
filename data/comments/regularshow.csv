regularshow,3dk1va,PorcupineTheory,2,Fri Jul 17 05:31:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but compared to the Adventure Time, Regular Show, and especially the Steven Universe episodes nominated here, they don't compare. As has been stated, people in these voting positions don't care about animation, at least not nearly enough to vote honestly. They'll see Mickey Mouse, and vote for it based on name only. It's the same reason Disney is always winning the Oscar. Superior films come out all the time, but Disney still wins because they're Disney."

Many of the episodes use pop culture references from the 90 like Skips wearing a red leather jacket while 'forever young' plays in the background . The gang Rickets?  Doing the  Warrior come out to playyyy thing but Mirdecai turn off your phoneee.  the character don't remains the same and they do mature and change overtime making them very relatable and interesting. You should simply have a go at it

regularshow,3d0qk4,AdricDePsycho,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:26:04 2015 UTC,"Favorite: Tough to say, but probably Skip's Story (he's my favorite character).  Least: Some of the romance episodes with either Margaret, CJ, or both. They're just so...annoying. Don't get me wrong, some of them aren't terrible, but the writers aren't good with prolonged romantic story arcs."

regularshow,3d0qk4,GradeAMeat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:40:06 2015 UTC,"I guess I wasn't too interested in Muscle Dad, and not much was very memorable like the villains or the adventure. Mordecai and Rigby had very little influence on the episode that they probably didn't need to be in it."

regularshow,3d0qk4,HesANowhereMan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:49:37 2015 UTC,"My favorite is tied with ""The End of Muscle Man"" and ""Real Date"".  I really, really, really didn't like Christmas episode where Margaret and Mordecai kissed. It felt like a punch in the gut. Mordecai was growing up and getting into a real relationship with CJ and then in the last few minutes he throws it all away.  I am way too invested in this show."
regularshow,3d0qk4,Monkeykatos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:42:47 2015 UTC,My least favorite episode (can't remember the name) is the one where Muscleman and Starla takes a break from their relationship after watching that movie. I'm generally not a big fan of the Muscleman and Starla centered episodes...mainly because it's gross to watch them kiss.

regularshow,3c3ze8,Charlie8090,6,Sun Jul 12 01:33:42 2015 UTC,"I gotta wonder about how the schedule is decided there. Flapjack and chowder were popular, and now theyre pretty much gone, then AT and RS are in the way off, but Tom and Jerry is always being played? How much Tom and Jerry can one channel air?"
regularshow,3c3ze8,decker12,5,Sun Jul 5 01:19:29 2015 UTC,"Chowder is on boomerang.  Also this is the first time Tom and Jerry has been on cn for a month or two. I like them airing some older cartoons even if this is the 2006 version. They need to make some time for AT and RS, though. It's like they're treating it as it's already ended."

regularshow,3b8x78,delQuponT,9,Fri Jun 26 23:11:32 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Plus, Rigby even said that their fake breakup would have to seem real. I think Eileen just used the opportunity to air some of her grievances so it would be convincing."

What if Mordecai gets fired or leaves his work or takes time off because he has to sort out some stuff ,and he becomes even more of a slacker and goes into DUDE mode ""Big Lebowski"" ? Mordude:dude DudeLebowski:THEdude Then he dissapers from a show for a while , giving more space for Rigleen to develop , but Rigbone misses him so he wants to undo this situation ?

regularshow,3b5dg2,TheRealLee,8,Fri Jun 26 02:42:31 2015 UTC,Let's remember that we mean a break from relationships. If Mordecai and CJ actually take a break and still have drama like this I'm gonna lose it.

And the Rigleen is all the stronger for it.  And while I'm not sure when exactly I place the two of them dating, I think it was definitely sometime before or around Eileen Flat Screen. Actually, the more I think about it, I have to agree with you on the end of last season. Real Date and thereabouts was pretty shippy."

regularshow,3b2ksk,CreepyMinerLance,4,Thu Jun 25 13:34:19 2015 UTC,I really don't understand why people obsess so much about Rigby going back in time. I always say it as a one-off plot device to get CJ back in the show. Was there ever a reason to think the show would go back to that plotline at all of is it just speculation?   I know the movie is supposed to involve time travel and the show seemed to hint at Rigby trying to stop Mordecai and CJ from kissing but I'm not sure if we will ever really see Rigby going back himself. It would be nice though

regularshow,3b04v2,GreatDragonator,27,Thu Jun 25 01:36:23 2015 UTC,why did they not mention the Eggcellent challenge?  It could've been a great and  real callback!
regularshow,3b04v2,curtis_epiks,18,Wed Jun 24 22:30:00 2015 UTC,Oh yea! I forgot about that one. I guess they didn't mention it because it would be like telling that exact same episode over again. Still would have been cool if they mentioned it though.
regularshow,3b04v2,GreatDragonator,8,Wed Jun 24 22:58:50 2015 UTC,Plus you'd think the Eggcellent Challenge  would've given Mordecai at minimum some resistance to the pain of eating a large meal.

regularshow,3b04v2,MintyFreshNipples,16,Thu Jun 25 00:51:51 2015 UTC,"Benson's a God of patience.  He puts up with so much shit.  I honestly don't think he could ever actually fire Mordecai and Rigby.  He likes them too much and has too big a heart, even if he doesn't want to admit it.  Benson's my ideal boss.  If you don't fuck everything up on a cosmic level he's remarkably chill considering and even then, as long as you clean it up, you still get to keep your job.  Mordo and Rigby are the worst employees imaginable.  Especially Rigby.  You'd have to be a saint not to fire them."
regularshow,3b04v2,AdricDePsycho,8,Wed Jun 24 22:43:49 2015 UTC,I think it was well deserved. Benson paid for everyone's sandwiches out of kindness and Mordo and Rigby decided to get that gigantic sandwich just because they thought it was funny.

I always like the flashbacks, especially the hairstyles and the clothes. Rigbys dad was funny too. I do have a question... Do Rigby and Morticai even take Bensons ""do this or your fired"" threats seriously? They always seems to. They go all out to do what they have to do to save their job. But I don't think benson would have the heart to fire them. He knows it would kill morale of the other employees, plus, benson truly likes the pair, and has said, ""Morticai and Rigby are the coolest people I know"".  His ""your fired"" threats don't have the meaning they used to."

regularshow,3b04s5,Kevin_LeStrange,12,Wed Jun 24 23:27:15 2015 UTC,"Well, to trigger the flashback, Rigby said ""Remember that time when you were in college?"" So he was probably visiting."

I imagine when that does happen, it will be some sort of multiverse type thing, and we'll see what would have happened if Mordecai didn't reconnect with C.J.    I can pretty much picture that now, and I can imagine Mordecai seeing the other future he could have had, and he'll have to make the tough decision of changing the past so that he could be happy when Margaret returned or staying with C.J.  Thing is, future Rigby's words haven't quite rang true yet, Mordecai seems pretty happy with C.J.  Future Rigby claimed the only way for Mordecai to be happy was for him to not have his New Year's kiss.  So does C.J. do something terrible in the future?  Is future Rigby just jealous of Mordecai not being around anymore?  Or is it as simple as Mordecai realizing that he's with the wrong girl and feeling like it's too late to fix all that he's (un)done?  As you can see, I clearly want closure on this, so it better not just be some open ended thing that never gets addressed again as to when and why exactly future Rigby told past Rigby to stop Mordecai from kissing (we assume) C.J."

regularshow,3ash19,gergy008,19,Tue Jun 23 03:41:23 2015 UTC,"I gotta agree with you man, im really liking these emotional episodes. They help flesh out the characters and make them way more memorable to me. A great example of this is how they've showed Rigby slowly warming up to Eileen. As for Mordecai I really enjoy watching his romantic struggles because we've all been there before, and we've all ""pulled a mordecai"" ourselves. It just makes the characters feel so much more relate-able. This new episode had all the feels while still managing to be quite funny, what else could we ask for?"
regularshow,3ash19,Luisthepanda,9,Tue Jun 23 05:05:28 2015 UTC,"Most cartoons don't go that deep   Maybe 10 years ago this was true, but there's a ton of deep, intellectually engaging animated shows these days. Adventure Time, Steven Universe, Gravity Falls,  Star vs the Forces of Evil (which I've yet to see, but I hear is fantastic), and, of course, Over the Garden Wall, just to name some off the top of my head. There's also a growing adult cartoon market that's way smarter than things like Family Guy could ever hope to be. It's a pretty great time to be into cartoons, actually!"

regularshow,3ash19,crims0nfox,3,Tue Jun 23 06:18:03 2015 UTC,"I kind of have to agree. This is a weird situation where Mordecai and Margaret are literally created for each other, and CJ is kind of literally the rain cloud raining on their parade.  The symbolism isn't really subtle, probably because the show's construction in its beginning wasn't meant to be deep, but I have to agree with what u/gergy008 has to say for the most part."

regularshow,3axo0b,kingmeh,10,Wed Jun 24 09:30:14 2015 UTC,"Ill pass on muscle man episodes. They all involve starla and its just getting stupid at this point. It's like ""Bro, you need to get a life, bro.""  Also, benson episodes are getting formulaic too. Benson complains about some work ethic thing, someone goes too far, stuff goes cray and then there's a throwaway gag at the end.  Skips episodes? More please. Pops episodes? Moar! Heck, a thomas episode again? Okay. But i'll take another 3 relationship episodes before I watch another muscleman or benson episode, bro."
regularshow,3axo0b,nachoiskerka,7,Wed Jun 24 14:12:00 2015 UTC,"Pretty much agreed. I like Benson episodes and wouldn't mind seeing a Muscle Man episode without Starla, but another Skips or Pops episode would be great."
regularshow,3axo0b,Powerstars,10,Wed Jun 24 17:56:56 2015 UTC,"Okay, so they do a mere 2 episodes in a row not involving them and they've disappeared? They were all in the Duck special, Rigby appeared in the Double Date episode, and played a major role in the Death Kwon Do-Livery episode, and Benson got a mention too. And, even though it'll have Mordo/CJ/Margaret drama, we're getting Muscle Man and Starla's wedding this week. I agree they could use more focus, but ""disappeared"" is a bit strong."
regularshow,3axo0b,Powerstars,3,Wed Jun 24 17:55:57 2015 UTC,"Yep, I'd say with the exception of Skips all of the characters have been pretty fairly represented.  I actually think that this season is the most we've seen of Muscle Man since the earlier seasons.  And although I understand some of the frustrations with the current running story arc of season 6, there really haven't been many more romantic episodes than in the previous seasons--it most likely just feels that way due to the fact that those episodes are connected rather than episodic as in previous seasons."
regularshow,3axo0b,nb14,3,Wed Jun 24 18:18:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it's more of a focused arc."

I know she was trying to ""not die"" by lying (makes sense), though this show takes place in such a crazy/dangerous world around Mordo, so I can't really see that being her real reason for doing it.  As Margaret said, she was tired of the bad vibes and wanted to start over.   Some here are all anti-CJ, but I'm still with her. I'd really hate to see the show take the more predictable route with him and Margaret."

regularshow,3aret1,Zokor,23,Tue Jun 23 00:14:18 2015 UTC,"Well, I liked certain parts at least. CJ tried to get to know Margaret better and reins in her anger at the climax but still remains as someone who wears her emotions at the sleeves. Margaret does get called out at the end for her past actions. Rigby still remains classic as he steals the show and keeps things fun. I wanted to see more of Dell's lies visually, but that's only because I enjoyed the pacing of the episode right up to the moment of truth. Unfortunately, navigating through the twists and turns of romance is not one of Regular Show's strengths.  It was nice to see things play out from Margaret's point of view for once. All too often, the relationship was mostly from Mordecai's perspective, which is nice and all, but it limited Margaret's reaction."
regularshow,3aret1,gizmo1492,9,Thu Jul 2 06:08:56 2015 UTC,"CJ tried to get to know Margaret better and reins in her anger at the climax but still remains as someone who wears her emotions at the sleeves.   But there's nothing wrong with that. It's good to be honest and open about your feelings. I'd say the way she reacted was very mature - especially compared to the last time they met, when she almost killed Margaret.  (Remember that all she did in this episode was show that she was angry. Her visibly changing to grey with lightning is just because she's a cloud. She doesn't control her appearance, her emotions do.)"
regularshow,3aret1,TheDocofEternal,7,Tue Jun 23 00:37:57 2015 UTC,"Bad phrasing, a common habit of mine when truncating my points. Sorry about that.  What I mean is that CJ is willing to look at her own mistakes and try to learn from them, but is still very shaken up by the outcome since she is naturally very emotional. She takes steps to rectify her flaws, and there's always a new twist to challenge what she's learned. Same with Margaret and everyone that's a major character.  Spoilers on this part just to be on the safe side. What I'm afraid of is that ultimately CJ's potential will be wasted as just another mere love interest of Mordecai. Sure, they planned the climax to be cringeworthy because people make mistakes, and I applaud them for the way they came to the conclusion. In the long run, however, CJ may as well be written off and forgotten eventually when she breaks up with Mordecai. She might as well be view as a pointless addition meant to draw out the ""Will they or won't they"" aspect of the Mordecai-Margaret relationship."
regularshow,3aret1,Will_billy,2,Tue Jun 23 18:00:45 2015 UTC,"I am a sucker for cjecai , for some reason I always preferred her over Margaret. I guess it's mainly because Margaret isn't as captivating as CJ. She has much more of that cool factor going on, where Margaret's persona is quite bland. I mean her father is a way better character. Then again the way the show is going you can see that CJ will eventually get tired of the entire situation and leave Mordecai. I think that is ok for her character progression as she always was the stronger more passionate character then Margaret. It makes sense that the writers went this was as otherwise we would have a. More conflict between girl and Mordecai, making the entire drama even longer or b. Margaret stop pursuing Mordecai, but we would just have more cj and Mordecai episodes but no change in over all plot making this unnecessary long. This could be a good time to make a new female character or concentrate on hi5 since he didn't get many episodes."
regularshow,3aret1,DrVush,20,Tue Jun 23 23:23:34 2015 UTC,So can we see more of Director Rigby? It's nice to see Rigby excel at stuff.

regularshow,3aret1,AdricDePsycho,3,Tue Jun 23 02:18:25 2015 UTC,"It's really cool to see he's actually good at something, I guess living in a world where crazy stuff  happens every day makes it easy to be a fiction writer."
regularshow,3aret1,GreatDragonator,38,Tue Jun 23 12:52:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly I thought this episode was a step forward for the series. It showed a ton of maturity by almost going the same crazy route as always by having CJ almost blow up, and then she surprisingly calmed down; both the show and CJ showed restraint. Meanwhile, Margaret actually got a lot more character development during this episode than over the whole series. I've never seen her this insecure or nervous before, and the fact that she gets a lot of screentime without Mordecai was a nice touch. Now he's the one with the girlfriend and she's the one who still likes him, so it's a cool reversal of the earlier seasons. Best of all, this episode was painfully realistic. Most cartoons can't pull off this level of awkwardness in a relatable way. Great episode!"
regularshow,3aret1,AdricDePsycho,18,Wed Jun 24 19:09:24 2015 UTC,"Yes! I thought it was really good. I wish this sub wasn't so negative about relationship episodes, though."

regularshow,3aret1,TheDocofEternal,12,Mon Jun 22 23:28:13 2015 UTC,"Definitely just stating a fact. The punchline is absolutely perfect at face value, so I really doubt there's anything more to it than that."

regularshow,3aret1,prism1234,11,Mon Jun 22 22:13:54 2015 UTC,"CJ's getting better, and I understand the jealousy that she has... still didn't make it any less of a gut clencher. But I like how she managed to calm herself. I can't decide who I'd prefer her or Margaret. And I usually like these relationship episodes, but this one was pretty uncomfortable and less relaxed, too stressful for my taste."
regularshow,3aret1,TheDocofEternal,3,Tue Jun 23 12:53:44 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit mixed with the relationship episodes, to be honest, but they often have merrit. The last one we had (1000th Chopper Flight) was a 7/10 in my opinion. This one was more uncomfortable and made me a bit exhasperated that the show is dragging it out this long. Heck, to be fair, they still had this problem when Margaret was dating Mordecai (though it was slightly less prominent, emphasis on slightly. I mean, I think Steak Me Amadeus is easily an 8/10, but that doesn't mean every romance episode was that good or better). The show should just wrap it up already."

regularshow,3aret1,Fluffydipper,3,Tue Jun 23 04:31:28 2015 UTC,"Eh, that wasn't that bad. It was an actually tolerable relationship episode, which is refreshing already, and there were lots of great moments, especially with Rigby and the newscaster guy.   This arc has been going for way too long, and has been mostly full of missteps. I think they just need to wrap this up as cleanly and quickly as possible, and then try again later. If they just take some time to learn from their mistakes across this arc, I wouldn't mind seeing more of stuff like this in the future."
regularshow,3aret1,Anti-PCG,4,Tue Jun 23 04:37:56 2015 UTC,"Wait seriously? The major discussion in this thread was not about how hilarious that ""ON THE LIPS"" guy during the Kiss Cam was??? I mean let's be real, he was like 80% of my memory of that episode..."
regularshow,3aret1,Lemurrific,5,Tue Jun 23 06:33:10 2015 UTC,This episode was VERY cringeworthy
regularshow,3aret1,TheDocofEternal,3,Fri Jun 26 12:30:44 2015 UTC,Well. That was something.
regularshow,3aret1,Randomnesty,3,Mon Jun 22 23:56:14 2015 UTC,"Well if you see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC0NAxulFmk it is now a fact that Mordo gets dumped. I personally prefer CJ as a much cooler and better developed character. From more realistic point of view , it is selfish from Margaret to expect Mordecai to wait for her , when she was went to college. Everybody has moved on , she should to."
regularshow,3aret1,TheDocofEternal,6,Tue Jun 23 01:38:25 2015 UTC,Damn. That was just. Blam. Too much for a teen to handle all at once.

Also, when Rigby did that voice mail trick, all I could think about was Archer."
regularshow,3aret1,wertyman131,5,Tue Jun 23 13:01:18 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but remember they don't have control over these breaks, and considering this week is supposed to have a progressive storyline, they couldn't shift it up. CN's scheduling just had a break between the Anime episode and this one, they didn't mean for it to be a ""This episode kicks of the week bomb!"" it just happened."
regularshow,3aret1,Rapidstrike,3,Tue Jun 23 10:26:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, alright. Good to know.  It's still a heavy start. Haha"
regularshow,3aret1,Dragonm45ter,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:03:56 2015 UTC,I haven't watched this show since Margaret went off to college. I'm so confused. What even is this show?
regularshow,3aret1,darkafternoon,6,Tue Jun 23 14:09:50 2015 UTC,"They've been messing around with dramatic relationship plotlines. Which they should at the very least do a better job of. I know people complain when a show starts putting emphasis on relationships and dating, but some shows can make it effectively work.  Regular Show usually can't. Except when they play it for comedy."
regularshow,3aret1,Powerstars,6,Mon Jun 22 22:30:59 2015 UTC,"I feel as though if they want relationships to work they need to take a  note or two from Adventure Time. AT does it right, but that's because they expand on more than just the idea of two people being together. The relationship is an experience and both parties grow from it."
regularshow,3aret1,darkafternoon,4,Mon Jun 22 22:40:26 2015 UTC,"That and a tip from Steven Universe. Or like I said, do it in a more comedic and lighthearted way. The episode where Mordecai first meets Margaret's dad was a great one, and the relationship drama wasn't the spotlight: it was just a component of the plot that leads into Regular Show doing its own brand of insanity. Now it certainly isn't BAD that Regular Show would dip into drama (look at Skip's Story, one of the show's best episodes), but they need to juggle it a little better."
regularshow,3aret1,Powerstars,4,Tue Jun 23 00:50:09 2015 UTC,I agree with all of this. Especially the Steven Universe bit. I just recently got into that show and its amazing all around. The episode Alone Together might be my favorite so far.

regularshow,3asz1q,dirtminer6,7,Tue Jun 23 07:00:06 2015 UTC,I won't like that personally. They've been dragging the relationship arc out for wwwaaaayyyyy too long and it should end.
regularshow,3asz1q,oopsidied,5,Tue Jun 23 11:21:03 2015 UTC,"A movie seems like a good way to wrap up the arc instead of multiple episodes, but it feels relate-able (aside from the supernatural stuff) so I don't mind the arc, I like them."

Maybe introduce new females as love interest. Butterfly effect

regularshow,38n8os,TheDidacticMuffin,3,Fri Jun 5 18:45:52 2015 UTC,"I think it'll be a two parter. The whole thing will kick off with Mordecai and CJ getting into some huge fight that causes a rift between the friend group. Rigby and Eileen will have to act as the go betweens transferring messages between the two and will begin to develop a romantic relationship that way. While all that is going on, Mr. Maellard is on his death bed and doesn't have much time left. He announces Pops as his successor which makes benson furious as he believes he deserves it and quits the park once and for all. Either due to Mordecai's anger or Pops's incompetence about running the park something supernatural happens and the group has one last real adventure. During this adventure Skips makes the ultimate sacrifice and gives up his immortality to ensure everyone's safety. He is then able to rejoin his long lost lover in Valhalla, heaven for warriors. Benson returns to save the day and realizes, though Pops may be in charge, the park would fall apart without him and takes his old job back. The whole thing Ends at Muscleman and Starla's wedding. Mordecai and CJ reconcile as friends, Eileen and Rigby officially start dating, and we get to see a whole bunch of characters we've met throughout the show at this wedding. Mordecai and Rigby decide to skip the after party and instead go back to the park house and play their video games, they beat the final boss and with one final ""OOOOOHHH"" they know that everything's the same and yet somehow things never will be the same again."
regularshow,38n8os,Jeffwaa,2,Fri Jun 5 18:23:03 2015 UTC,I like this.
regularshow,38n8os,KingOfThrowaway12345,2,Fri Jun 5 16:15:22 2015 UTC,"Naw man. Naw.   Regular Show is going to end with Mordecai fucking things up with C.J. (Again. Ohhhhh!) and breaking up. We'll get a montage of the other series of relationships that he fucks up one way or another, getting more and more like future moredecai from the no rules episode.  We eventually fade into Future Mordecai working Bensons Job. Rigby doesn't hang out with him anymore, having married Eileen (Because he is clearly competent in relationships) and grown up and finding Mordecai awkward and depressing to be around.   I guess Pops is still around but, well, he's Pops, and there's always Skipps but he's skips. Mordecai has all sorts of issues same way Benson does. He spends most of his time trying to reign in the new generation of park workers.  The series will end with Mordecai walking into his depressing apartment and looking at a picture of himself and CJ (Sorry Team Margret, there was nothing really sentimental between them. He'd just be remebering a lot of awkward ""Heh heh heh heh."" Look at each other but nothing happens moments). The ""This is way better than a mix tape."" line from the episode where CJ meets his mom plays, Mordo sheds a single tear.  Fin.  J.G. Quintell acquires adequate sadness to power the Genesis device and recreates reality in his own image where everyone is an anthropomorphic animal who is sort of a stoner."
regularshow,38n8os,treetown1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:56:57 2015 UTC,"Agree - can't end on a typical happy ending - where everyone pairs off and are happy - maybe once early one that was how the show was heading but so much about the show is about people dealing with unhappiness and learning to compensate and adjust. Like in particular the notion that Mordecai ends up running the park AND Rigby finally gets his &#@ together - probably gets his GED and grows up when he realizes Eileen is actually worth getting his #%& together for.  Skips goes on - he and Klorgbane are cut in an endless loop - like a comet, Klorgbane returns and Skips smashes him back into space. The park and the world becomes transformed into a futuristic green space but Skips will always be there."

Or maybe he's secretly worried doing it will lead to what always happens with Mordecai. (series of awkwardness and not knowing what to do)

After 1000th Chopper Flight Party I think I just kinda noped out on the whole relationship thing and started wishing for Mordo to be single again. That way he and Rigs can have more bro time, which is pretty much what Regular Show is about. Two bros hanging out, working at a crappy job and smoking weed having weird adventures. I still really want Rigleen to happen at some point, though."

regularshow,385be0,timtheancient,1 point,Tue Jun 2 10:39:52 2015 UTC,I've always thought this was a possibility because at some point he could just be completely comfortable but CJ will still be rattled about everything with Margret. In the end I could see CJ and Mordo not being together which can go back to the new years kiss episode. It could be a difficult choice for Mordecai and bother him a lot. This being said it doesn't mean he will go back to Margret but they could do that.

regularshow,386gkb,HowlingWolf13,2,Tue Jun 2 05:39:45 2015 UTC,Really? I have just seen the 1st half of season 4 and I loved most of the episodes. Exit 9b was crazy cool.
regularshow,386gkb,ThePreciseClimber,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:24:43 2015 UTC,"To me, Season 4 had a few good episodes, but most of them were mediocre (Ace Balthazar Lives and That's My Televison for example.) to bad (TTOTPII, Country Club, and MM and Starla eps). Those MM eps...they were WAY to many episodes for him that season with most of them focusing on his relationship with Starla and ended with them making out or MM making me want to gouge my eyes out (Bald Spot). Honestly, I think people who see the season now may just think its mediocre, but they didn't have to sit through week by week of mediocre eps and MM eps (sometimes two episodes focusing on him in a row.) and wait through the hiatuses, so they can't get the full experience (Its like endless eight, you just had to be there.). Also, Mordecai's and Margaret's slow building relationship that was in the end for nothing (They definitely should have done Margaret leaving for college better than just dropping a bomb like that.)."

There's the Terror Tales of the Park episode wherein all of them die and become ghosts, including Skips, but it's still a special Halloween episode which doesn't affect the timeline of Regular Show. There's other counter points to this like Mona and Skips, but you can see where I'm going with this."

regularshow,36ekhl,Fishious1,58,Mon May 18 19:49:55 2015 UTC,"I've watched both since they began and from the beginning loved them equally, but when I really think about it Adventure Time (in my opinion) has been getting exponentially better while I feel like Reg Show has stagnated a bit. Don't get me wrong, I still adore Reg Show and have been keeping up with it and enjoying every episode, but the overarching themes and storylines have never been particularly deep or thought provoking. Regular Show has always been episodic with minor continuity and I think that's part of it's appeal, but the things they choose to focus on and come back to (particularly Mordo's romantic problems) never really pulled me in.  Adventure Time also began very episodic and with some pretty immature humor and themes, but has been building upon itself and maturing throughout its entire run. If you were to watch an episode from season 1 and then jump to a recent episode, the show might be entirely unrecognizable (if not for the distinct art and design). They've begun to delve into some pretty heavy topics and have introduced tons of new characters (that frequently are given an entire episode sans Finn and Jake) as well as timelines.  Basically all I can say is that I think Adventure Time is one of the most unique and thought provoking cartoons out there and I would recommend it to anyone. People like to brush it off and pretend it's a silly children's cartoon, which is certainly can be when it wants to, but it is so much more than that.  While I'm here I just need to plug another amazing cartoon, Steven Universe. I think the same type of people who judge Adventure Time for it's childish art or silly jokes probably write off Steven Universe for similar reasons, but it's another deceptive cartoon that when you really sit down and pay attention to the story and characters you can see so much more."

I don't wanna go back to using shitty sites like watchcartoon if kiss disappears.
regularshow,36ekhl,Lemurrific,2,Tue May 19 23:57:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And I'm 100% with you. But it's not up to us if the site stays up. It's up to the networks.  There is a TON of copywritten material on there, and honestly, obscurity doesn't keep things like that hidden forever. Just a matter of when, not if.  I just hope that CN and other networks get with it, and put content up within the week it airs, if not a few hours after. It seems like CN is slowly getting there, since they pulled their content from Netflix, it seems like they're trying to drive people/revenue to their app. If they want that to succeed, they need to have more than their backlist of shows on there, they need recently aired stuff too."
regularshow,36ekhl,4chanisblockedatwork,4,Wed May 20 00:55:18 2015 UTC,"Some of it is on Netflix, I'm not sure about Hulu."
regularshow,36ekhl,OddjobNick,3,Mon May 18 21:30:04 2015 UTC,"Most of Steven Universe is on Hulu+, but I don't think it's available for free accounts.   They recently added many many Cartoon Network shows! Could free-trial it, perhaps."
regularshow,36ekhl,BoopysRevenge,4,Mon May 18 22:21:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Though I preferred RS to AT by leagues I  the past, regular show has indeed kind of stagnated a bit. The first 3 seasons were one of the funniest episodes I've enjoyed ever since I started watching cartoons. I think one of the reasons AT has space to grow is because of the expansive world it features. Pen Ward can pretty much think of an undiscovered land or tribe and show it in the new episode."
regularshow,36ekhl,TheDocofEternal,2,Tue May 19 03:24:12 2015 UTC,Well said. Thank you.
regularshow,36ekhl,Boondlock,0,Tue May 19 02:48:50 2015 UTC,My biggest problem with Adventure Time is how fucking long it takes them to actually develop any significant plot points at all. They just kind of cock tease you with little tid bits here and there and never go anywhere with them. Atleast Regular Show develops its plot in a timely manner.
regularshow,36ekhl,Lord_of_the_Dance,1 point,Sat May 23 07:30:50 2015 UTC,"Next week features the possible conclusion to the ""Upcoming Comet"" plot point. But I get what you mean, we've seen very little of the Mushroom War (but to be fair, Pen said they wouldn't delve to deeply into it)"

regularshow,36ekhl,burritosandblunts,4,Wed May 20 04:06:31 2015 UTC,"It really really depends. Adventure Time has fantastic episodes and really bad episodes. There's not much between. Where regular show is an all ages show in a sense that every episode can appeal to all audiences, adventure time is a show where some episodes are blatantly NOT aimed at my demographic.  It's extremely hit or miss with me. My best friend is working on a list of adventure time episodes that are aimed more at the adult demographic, or that are important to character development and story arcs. If you're interested I'll link you when he's finished."

Unfortunately they also have had some moments that really put me off, like (SPOILER ALERT) the ending of the Finn/FP arc. Like seriously guys? Finn shows himself to be a model hero time and time again throughout the story. Way to annihilate his character by making him act like a jerk. It would have been much better if FP had emotionally destroyed his whole world instead.  That said though, the good far outweighs the bad and it definitely should be watched if you have the time."

regularshow,35dlsh,autowikiabot,1 point,Fri May 29 11:28:17 2015 UTC,"Guardians of Eternal Youth (from Regularshow wikia):       The Guardians of Eternal Youth, formally known as the Immortal Student Council, are a group of babies that guard and give the ability of eternal youth. Skips worships them so he doesn't die.  The Guardians of Eternal Youth are five big chubby babies with deep voices that granted Skips eternal youth. They are shown during ""Free Cake"" and ""Fists of Justice"" (also during ""Brain Eraser"" and individually during ""Skips Strikes"", ""Quips"", and ""Terror Tales of the Park III""). They demand that Skips needs to perform a ritual on his birthday to retain eternal youth, and they try to take it away from him when Rigby interrupts Skips during the ritual. They apparently love cake (especially chocolate), since they restored Skips' eternal youth in exchange for cake (which they rubbed on themselves, much to Rigby's dismay). Reginald, the leader of the guardians, appeared in ""Skips Strikes"" as a member of the Magical Elements. In ""Fists of Justice,"" they call Skips to fight their brother Klorgbane the Destroyer. It was also revealed in ""Skips' Story"" they went to high school with Skips.

It's the same show, but with more continuity of story rather then single adventures.  I like that it's using good character development for pretty much the whole cast. From muscle man getting married to Mordecai's romantic trials and even Rigby and Eileen getting closer"
regularshow,34g06h,m8ushido,10,Thu Apr 30 22:59:02 2015 UTC,Just as good imo. Yeah they get into awkward relationship stuff but even when they're on a boring date it's regular show so something is exploding or a giant battle happens.

It's easy to look at the show as a passerby and dismiss it, wanting for more adult themes. Anyone who regularly watches the show probably wouldn't be saying that.   And I guess there are always people who will say that. Look at Ren and stimpy when they remixed it as an adult only show. It wasn't funny anymore."

Skips beat em ups, cj mini golfs of insanity, muscleman kart racing, pops fighting/wrestling(hulk hogan cameo), a rigby/mordecai rail shooter, a thomas roguelike, a mordecai dating sim and finally action rpg style boss fights like a mix of legend of zelda and shadow of the colossus using the mechanics of the character's playstyle while margaret narrates the fight from a newschopper.

regularshow,3385ga,beermit,10,Mon Apr 20 23:30:28 2015 UTC,Regular Show used to be way better imo. I don't really mind the dramatic relationship episodes but it seems like they are just running out of ideas. I feel like the older episodes are so much more original.
regularshow,3385ga,Nikokan,3,Tue Apr 21 09:04:48 2015 UTC,"A few of my friends feel as if the show has lost its touch, but they haven't watched it much over the past season.

regularshow,3385ga,PhillyDuke,17,Fri Apr 24 11:38:03 2015 UTC,"Tbh, I really like how the direction of the show changed.

Probably because I can relate better to the relationship, as well as chemistry, between Mordecai and Margaret.  Honestly, I spent most of season 5 secretly hoping for Margaret to return to the show again - which was somewhat to be expected :)"
regularshow,3385ga,Zokleen,6,Tue Apr 21 17:43:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have to admit, I'm starting to drift from the show, and I've been watching from the beginning. I can't pinpoint the reason, but here are two things.  One of the more recent episodes where they're in that store looking for a garage door - man was that a chore to watch. Idk why, but it was so not good. I like how the show is random and weird but when they have an entire episode dedicated to whacky-ass shit with no real connection to reality at all, it just wasn't good. It seemed like a really phoned-in episode.  Another thing is a lot of the love-triangle crap. The most utterly cliche trope there is where 99% of the problems could be avoided if the main character just spoke up. Regular Show has it the worst though, where Mordecai becomes a blubbering idiot around Margaret thus causing all of his issues. It's more frustrating than funny imo.  It still has it's good episodes now and then, but not nearly as frequently."

regularshow,3385ga,cosmiccrystalponies,3,Mon Apr 20 19:34:01 2015 UTC,That's why I like Steven universe so far almost every other episode has been decently serious and advance the plot while everyone one that doesn't is just a random adventure. Adventure time and regular show should both follow that more. It's great to have episodes of character and world development but I also want am equal number of episodes with crazy antics.

regularshow,3385ga,That0neKid,5,Mon Apr 20 20:53:09 2015 UTC,"Well, it got more serious for sure, with much more character development around season 5-6.

Now it's much more of a world where each character has a story and their own reasons and motivation for doing the things they do. It's still silly, but its become more meaningful as well."

Really deep characterizations, lots of metaphors, cool action, just everything great. It's gotten really dark and intense sometimes too which I definitely feel is a positive. I will admit there's some throw away episodes, but there's a lot more good than bad.  I haven't been keeping up with regular show as much since around cj came around. To me RS has gotten much less creative, the dialogues worse, and idk it's such a drastic change from the first 2 seasons which I thought were so amazing."

Wait wait wait!!!, If dating people is for b*tches, my life was a big LIE; friendzoned Mordecai? mmm, nope; Cj is better, based on what? cool and like Mordo? but why Mordecai is not dating rigby, because he's a Mordecai copypaste, eh?

regularshow,334kly,reynaldo123,3,Sun Apr 19 16:00:53 2015 UTC,"In my speculative headcanon, this is one of Margaret's character flaws which compliments Mordecai's approach to relationships like yin and yang.

He didn't tell her until later. Was it frustrating to watch? Yeah but that's how it went. Mordo didn't say anything until it was too late.
regularshow,32uboa,MissBanknote,60,Thu Apr 16 19:48:43 2015 UTC,THEY SAY HIGH-FIVE GHOST IS IN THERE.  HIGH FIVE GHOST IS NO WHERE TO BE SEEN.  Best promo ever or worst knockoff ever.
regularshow,32uboa,Sarge-Pepper,5,Thu Apr 16 20:41:03 2015 UTC,Here I thought the picture didn't load.
regularshow,32uboa,Rogankiwifruit,19,Fri Apr 17 01:08:44 2015 UTC,"The ""Standard Program"" toys are awesome."
regularshow,32uboa,goatsandbros,5,Thu Apr 16 20:25:28 2015 UTC,"Fucking hell, well done"
regularshow,32uboa,MyHandIsNumb,15,Thu Apr 16 20:27:20 2015 UTC,"These toys are lame. They only have, like, 3 points of articulation.   Playco? More like PlayBlow!"
regularshow,32uboa,comeguzzler,12,Thu Apr 16 22:41:17 2015 UTC,"We were tempted, at first, to repaint them and actually make them look like the characters... But I guess we've kinda fallen in love with how terrible they are."
regularshow,32uboa,nintendonate64,10,Thu Apr 16 20:37:30 2015 UTC,You know who else likes knock off Regular Show merch...?
regularshow,32uboa,im_lost_at_sea,23,Thu Apr 16 21:17:37 2015 UTC,MY MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
regularshow,32uboa,javiboy91,9,Thu Apr 16 21:21:18 2015 UTC,kind of ironic after last weeks episode..
regularshow,32uboa,This_Is_The_Life,6,Thu Apr 16 23:33:05 2015 UTC,Super Saiyan Skips
regularshow,32uboa,MrMoustachio,3,Fri Apr 17 00:09:59 2015 UTC,You should post this to /r/Ashens.
regularshow,32uboa,izlude7027,7,Fri Apr 17 06:46:51 2015 UTC,Rigby Voice UGH!!!! Who made this garbage?
regularshow,32uboa,Spinetablet,4,Thu Apr 16 21:59:16 2015 UTC,STEP OOOOOOFF
regularshow,32uboa,NeonToaster,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:17:03 2015 UTC,STOP TALKING!!!
regularshow,32uboa,Spinetablet,3,Fri Apr 17 06:28:35 2015 UTC,Why the fuck did they make Muscle Man's eyes red?  Why
regularshow,32uboa,nvrwastetree,12,Thu Apr 16 20:36:23 2015 UTC,But.... Muscle mans eyes ARE red.   I'm more concerned about Skips' fur
regularshow,32uboa,TheApollo1,8,Thu Apr 16 21:58:47 2015 UTC,Really they're just a slight pinkish colour. Something that would normally be left out in toy manufacturing.  Skips looks like he got taken in by an elderly smoking couple who don't take care of him.
regularshow,32uboa,ben123111,2,Fri Apr 17 01:29:54 2015 UTC,That our skips had jaundice and his liver is failing... So much for immortality

regularshow,32uboa,spanieldaniel,1 point,Sun Apr 19 01:19:03 2015 UTC,I don't think you know what knock off means
regularshow,32w1ey,duffman182,5,Fri Apr 17 04:30:04 2015 UTC,woo hoo go Regular Show!
regularshow,32w1ey,GradeAMeat,5,Fri Apr 17 08:05:28 2015 UTC,Probably because Adventure Time's hiatuses are longer than Regular Show's.
regularshow,32w1ey,tatooine0,3,Fri Apr 17 16:06:34 2015 UTC,"Indeed, but now that Regular Show is on a little hiatus and Adventure a Time is back, Adventure Time will get a bit ahead again.  I love both shows (and Clarence) mind you, they make a great pairing by airing together.  Cartoon Network has been pretty great at finding cartoons that can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike."
regularshow,32uhpt,VecterStroke,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:33:27 2015 UTC,Hopefully they have another episode with it.
regularshow,32uhpt,Jasonexpo,-1,Sun Apr 19 06:15:59 2015 UTC,"I would call the episode apology date, since mordecai needs some way to gain Cjs trust, or mabye theyll leave the problem untouched and ho on to the regular and generic one episode each 2 weeks"
regularshow,32rtm7,TheOfficialR3x0r,19,Thu Apr 16 04:58:05 2015 UTC,So they did sigh that contract from PlayCo...
regularshow,32rtm7,Skypho,8,Thu Apr 16 09:22:31 2015 UTC,More like LameCo
regularshow,32rtm7,Pudge_The_Fish,1 point,Thu Apr 16 13:10:29 2015 UTC,More like PlayBlows!
regularshow,32rtm7,angelfromthecoast,12,Thu Apr 16 22:07:34 2015 UTC,Gonna be seeing that muscle man toy in my nightmares for a while.
regularshow,32rtm7,CarvelCakee,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:15:11 2015 UTC,"by FAR the worst one. Looks like they made it, then accidentally left it on the stove, but didn't remember in time to save it."
regularshow,32rtm7,pjndgaf,7,Tue Apr 28 01:08:02 2015 UTC,Pops looks a liiiiiittle too rapey.
regularshow,32rtm7,Hip_Knox,9,Thu Apr 16 05:30:25 2015 UTC,"Like, there was an acceptable level of rapey, but this is just too much"
regularshow,32rtm7,crazycatlandshark,2,Thu Apr 16 08:29:42 2015 UTC,Pops looks kinda high to me. Like super stoned
regularshow,32rtm7,Will_billy,7,Thu Apr 16 18:52:10 2015 UTC,I think this was the inspiration for the playco episode
regularshow,32rtm7,burritosandblunts,6,Thu Apr 16 11:37:13 2015 UTC,They're bootlegs of figures that already looked like shit. My kinda toy. I bet they come in a zip lock bag.
regularshow,32rtm7,BlocMan7,3,Thu Apr 16 12:50:17 2015 UTC,Looks like these action figures have been indulging in a few too many wings...
regularshow,32rtm7,NinjaBadonk,5,Thu Apr 16 05:43:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, god. Muscle Man looks super stoned and brings up the question of why does he have nipples?"

regularshow,32rtm7,VtArMs,2,Thu Apr 16 07:25:46 2015 UTC,Muscleman's moobs look like start somewhere on his back and he throws them over his shoulder...I'm deeply disturbed.

regularshow,32rtm7,skawarrior,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:55:31 2015 UTC,Have I got my TV contrast controls way off? I did not realise Skips was yellow!
