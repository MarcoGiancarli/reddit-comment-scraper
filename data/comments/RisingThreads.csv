Despite being a long time gamer, it was the first time I experienced a first person shooter online.  My game time ran silly, surpassing 40 days and stuck the final nail in my two year long relationship with my ex."
RisingThreads,3e41fi,t2487,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:12:31 2015 UTC,"Battlefield 1942. I played it from release until about a year and a half ago. Yes, there are still active servers for the game. I specialized as a pilot. I put in countless hours. I had an insane kill/death ratio. I was temporarily banned from one of the biggest servers because they suspected me of hacking. My name was eventually cleared. My prowess as a pilot became my identity. I was feared and respected online, even if no where else. I started to wonder what I could achieve if I put that kind of time and effort into something that would ultimately matter in life. I finally uninstalled and walked away."

It's still months from the primary, this is the time that outsiders get more attention than realistic candidates.  July of the year before the election is when Nader, Ron Paul, Pat Buchanan, etc. get their best press.  It won't last."
