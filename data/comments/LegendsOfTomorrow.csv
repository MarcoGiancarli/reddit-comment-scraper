LegendsOfTomorrow,3e16xd,CopperWalrus,21,Tue Jul 21 04:10:04 2015 UTC,Highly doubt it.  Unless i'm mistaken that's only a new 52 thing.  And also I like that not everyone of the flash's villains is a meta-human.   The rouges aren't great because of their guns and what they do.  They are great because they are creative and are smart with their plans.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3e16xd,fluffynubkin,14,Tue Jul 21 04:53:47 2015 UTC,"Well, at least Snart is creative and smart..."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3e16xd,thelongestshot,8,Tue Jul 21 12:16:12 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, the scene where (minor S1 spoilers) they're captured and saved by Snart's sister is basically pulled straight from New 52."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3e16xd,The-Dragonborn,7,Tue Jul 21 14:05:49 2015 UTC,They are great because of the actors. Don't get me wrong I love show but it drives me insane every time the Flash fights them. JUST BUM RUSH THEM! WHY ARE YOU WASTING TIME TRYING TO GET THEM TO CROSS STREAMS!!!!  That being said they are my favorite villains on the show
LegendsOfTomorrow,3e16xd,RANDALLFLA666,2,Tue Jul 21 17:31:36 2015 UTC,at least in the comics they explain that cold's gun creates a cold shield that slows anything that goes through it down.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3e16xd,fluffynubkin,3,Tue Jul 21 20:23:36 2015 UTC,Oh that's very cool. I hope they add that next season. It would take like a second of dialogue and makes so much sense.

LegendsOfTomorrow,3e16xd,50doctorwho,11,Wed Jul 22 01:13:58 2015 UTC,Geoff Johns is a purist when it comes to The Rogues. He's the one who severed Captain Cold's cold powers so he'd start using the gun again. There's no way he'd allow his favorite supervillain to undergo the same perceived mistake again.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3e16xd,yuloforce,3,Tue Jul 21 15:14:39 2015 UTC,Probably not.

Not to mention that in the New 52 the then Flash writer Brian Buccellato had the rogues in a freak accident which made them get powers, Captain Cold gained the ability to shoot ice from his hands but Geoff undid the whole thing in Forever Evil by having Snart lose his powers and going back to the Cold gun."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3dyesp,ElsakaS,7,Mon Jul 20 15:31:57 2015 UTC,Sounds like we're going to need a large chart of airdates and a viewing order breakdown.  It's going to be a lot more confusing with three shows than it was last year with two.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3dyesp,TripJammer,2,Mon Jul 20 16:53:43 2015 UTC,I agree specially because LoT will have few more episodes left after Flash and Arrow had their season finale.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3dyesp,linke92,3,Mon Jul 20 17:14:48 2015 UTC,"At SDCC, I think Marc (or one of the execs, I forget) mentioned that it was meant to start mid-season. It would be nice to fill the void of no Flash/Arrow"
LegendsOfTomorrow,3dyesp,linke92,2,Mon Jul 20 23:20:01 2015 UTC,mid-season usually starts when the shows are coming back from their winterbreak.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3dyesp,ExynosHD,2,Tue Jul 21 01:19:38 2015 UTC,Ohhh okay that makes sense
LegendsOfTomorrow,3dyesp,ExynosHD,2,Tue Jul 21 01:41:36 2015 UTC,With super girl premiering at 8pm on Mondays (I think) I don't expect it to also play on a Monday. My guess is Thursdays at 8 and they reshuffle any shows to make that work
LegendsOfTomorrow,3dyesp,brazil201,2,Tue Jul 21 03:35:00 2015 UTC,"That is a good point.   But I still think it will be Tuesday at 9p.m, because The Flash can give a strong Lead-in and Thursday is for Vampire Diaries and their own Spin-off The Originals."

LegendsOfTomorrow,3dlhzh,_mach,7,Fri Jul 17 10:24:10 2015 UTC,"According to the DC Wikia this gives him only basic-level hand-to-hand proficiency:   Hand-to-Hand Combat (Basic): Although Rip prefers the solitude of a laboratory, he has also trained himself in the martial combat lessons from societies and cultures from BC to the end of time. Rip demonstrated his ability to hold his own in a fight when he fought against renegade time traveler Rex Hunter. [12]   But more importantly, the Rip Hunter of the comics is not a lanky British man, so I doubt it matters either way. Darvill is doing martial art's training, so we'll probably see him with some skills though."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3dlhzh,1dererLives,4,Fri Jul 17 13:09:39 2015 UTC,I honestly hope we see Oliver vs Sara for whatever reason just so we can see the hopefully noticeable improvement in Oliver's skills
LegendsOfTomorrow,3dlhzh,Exwind,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:17:06 2015 UTC,"That's the thing though, Oliver doesn't improve his skills in the way Flash does. He's already a hyper badass in combat and with the bow. It's mental improvement that he's really making."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3dlhzh,Persian_Assassin,0,Sun Jul 19 00:22:09 2015 UTC,"If Sara's going to be the only powerless character on Legends of Tomorrow, I'm thinking that the writers would have to be crazy to have her job to Oliver.

LegendsOfTomorrow,3dlhzh,Nightwing89,7,Fri Jul 17 06:38:18 2015 UTC,"If I were writing this, I'd treat Rip Hunter as the diplomatic leader but his first solution in the comics is rarely violence. He can fight when necessary, but he usually gets others to do that for him. Rip would tell the others the plan, but not all of it, and while the team fights the bad guys they will also argue among themselves with who is in charge on the battlefield,  cuz Rip will run off doing something else while the team keeps the heat off him. Rip is a chess player. He will be using the others as pawns in a game with Vandal Savage that may bring into question his true motives. Whatever he claims the goal will be at first, will not be the whole story."

LegendsOfTomorrow,3dfvct,Galorekilla,14,Wed Jul 15 23:10:07 2015 UTC,"Thoughts:       1) The biggest explicit plot news for me is that Sara's resurrection takes place on Arrow. No waiting until mid-season for more Sara!       2) Combined with Rip Hunter making a comment about ""those who survive"" becoming legends (in the teaser), Guggenheim's and Klemmer's statements that ""no one is safe"" and ""Others might not make it along for the full trip, or will get lost in weird time periods"" makes it seem like a pretty good bet that we'll be getting at least one death and at least one person being either temporarily or permanently stranded in time. My odds for the deaths are: Firestorm (Stein only) and/or Heat Wave.        3)  LoT being closer in tone to The Flash than it is to Arrow -- but also being more adult -- has me tremendously excited. I'm really hoping that ""more madcap"" indicates that it will downplay the more CW-ish aspects of these shows in favour of building forward momentum.        4) I loved this comment: ""Heat Wave and Captain Cold, and Caity’s character [White Canary], we’re there to add edge and spice and some rough and tumble to this newly assembled team.""       I like that we're seeing these three stay in the ""rogue zone"", at least for now.  It's good to know that none of them will be turning into paladins in the near future, and that Sara will retain or build on her edge post-lazarus.      5)Having character conflicts that arise because of differing worldviews is a lot more interesting than plot-driven character conflicts, and it sounds like this show will give us that. The things said in this interview confirm that I am anticipating LoT even more than I am Flash, which I did not think would be possible after the latter show's finale."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3dfvct,1dererLives,7,Thu Jul 16 00:49:49 2015 UTC,"Heat Wave is easily the most expendable. As a character he seems the most uninteresting and will be able to die, have the main character shock factor and no one feels like they wasted a character."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3dfvct,TheJoshider10,3,Thu Jul 16 00:58:18 2015 UTC,"Heat Wave can't die until they have a full rogue team up though, so maybe we will get that in the first half of Flash S2."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3dfvct,Flgibson97,2,Thu Jul 16 01:52:43 2015 UTC,Heatwave serves almost no purpose with Firestorm there.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3dfvct,gadgetguy03,5,Thu Jul 16 02:59:46 2015 UTC,If Firestorm had the correct powers he totally would

LegendsOfTomorrow,3d76ep,Comicfan1001,2,Tue Jul 14 13:29:19 2015 UTC,This one seems obvious given the relation to Rip Hunter.  I'm sure we'll see Booster at some point.

Sara is a bit of a lone wolf character, and it would be interesting to see her allowed to be that in the story -- not that she can't have relationships, but maybe not with one of her co-workers. Overall, I'm not sure that this is a show that really needs a lot of romance.   If Sara had to be in a relationship with a teammate, it could possibly be interesting if it was with Rip. What makes a guy take the steps he has? There could be an interesting dynamic between the two."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3d7g93,xHovercraft,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:13:55 2015 UTC,"I think Sara's being a lone wolf is what makes this kind of work; we've seen how lone Ray can become when absorbed into his work, and we know he was alone after his fiancee was killed. And when Sara comes back she's going to be a little crazy, so it makes sense for her to go for such an unexpected character."

LegendsOfTomorrow,3cza97,sethbenw,2,Mon Jul 13 05:39:18 2015 UTC,"OMAC and Brother Eye were both used directly. The OMAC program was a Queen Consolidated project and the pretty much the entire reason Ray Palmer bought the company (it's displayed on screens a few times and I think Ray calls it by name once), and was the basis for the ATOM suit. Brother Eye had an entire episode to ""itself"", when he was really just the program used by some WiFi Ninja that Felicity knew.  Not impossible that we'll see a bunch of OMAC suits turned into drones (like Iron Man 2) or have kidnapped people strapped inside of them so the team can't go apeshit on them (like in the comics), with Brother Eye controlling them remotely (as was shown possible on one of the later episodes of Arrow, with Ray controlling the suit with Felicity inside it)."

Yeah, there's the obvious jumping on the success train of Arrow and Flash and trying to make as much money as possible.

Considering its established superhero pedigree, I would expect a premiere during Feb sweeps, possibly March."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3bbs1a,Azgaard,3,Sat Jun 27 19:15:38 2015 UTC,"Made the most sense for a later start anyways. 3 series with the same characters at the same time? Means characters would have to jump around non-stop between stories and cities...  Made the most sense to me to have Arrow and Flash happen concurrently, like they did the past season, with something happening in the middle/end of both shows' season that opens the door to LoT"

LegendsOfTomorrow,3bdyoe,Galorekilla,16,Sun Jun 28 08:57:28 2015 UTC,how is this show already out of other things to talk about?
LegendsOfTomorrow,3bdyoe,panthyren,4,Sun Jun 28 09:12:56 2015 UTC,Probably because it hasn't started yet. There are only a handful of things and so many theories someone can post lol
LegendsOfTomorrow,3bdyoe,call_the_eagles,-11,Sun Jun 28 14:33:39 2015 UTC,Its not out of things to talk about I just also want to talk about this as well
LegendsOfTomorrow,3bdyoe,Todrick,8,Sun Jun 28 09:28:28 2015 UTC,I think Tumblr's collective head would explode.  They are seriously not OK with the idea of Nyssa being with any male at all ever. They've actually threatened Marc Guggenheim if he should ever consider it.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3bdyoe,call_the_eagles,3,Sun Jun 28 14:19:39 2015 UTC,Don't worry Guggenheim told us he had no plans to mess with Nyssa's homosexuality.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3bdyoe,Todrick,2,Sun Jun 28 14:41:28 2015 UTC,I wasn't worried... Just like I wouldn't worry if they decided to have Oliver come out.  I'm not really hung up on sexuality.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3bdyoe,call_the_eagles,-1,Sun Jun 28 15:32:13 2015 UTC,Lol it would be great if Oliver was gay. We could have a olivbarry ship

LegendsOfTomorrow,3b4hep,Thesuper_Toaster,10,Thu Jun 25 22:06:44 2015 UTC,"I think one of the major differences is that this Hawkgirl isn't an alien like the one from the animated series. Also, in the animated series, Hawkgirl was Spoiler and that was a huge part of her character so I think the Legends of Tomorrow version would have to be completely different."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3b4hep,jacobtie,5,Fri Jun 26 00:52:19 2015 UTC,That's kind of disappointing but it makes sense.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3b4hep,hardgeeklife,9,Fri Jun 26 01:00:42 2015 UTC,"I could care less how they decide to handle her history if they decide to keep her personality. I loved the fact that, of all the Justice league, she was the most warrior-like, even moreso than Wonder Woman! Shayera was the most aggressive fighter (and the loudest!), and it really set her apart from the others. It was a nice change from the more measured/calculated approaches from the other leaguers."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3b4hep,call_the_eagles,3,Fri Jun 26 13:44:02 2015 UTC,Totally agree. She's such s strong character and I hope that shows in the show.

It's too great of an opportunity for them to pass up, especially when we're already likely to be getting Jay Garrick in The Flash..   But then again Warner might be a dick about it and not allow the show to use Booster Gold."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3b33qy,xHovercraft,2,Fri Jun 26 07:22:21 2015 UTC,I don't think Warner and DC have any plans for Booster Gold in their Cinematic Universe as of now. If they do then it's probably a Blue Beetle type thing were they're still unsure or in development of plans for the character.

The first season won't, the second season isn't likely to, but it's possible. If he shows up, it won't be for long, and he won't be Booster Gold, but we may get a nod to it like with Jay Garrick's helmet. I don't believe Jay will be in the next season, he very well may appear, but he's not a necessary character."

LegendsOfTomorrow,3ammis,ElDuderino2112,6,Sun Jun 21 19:09:38 2015 UTC,"I was just thinking that. Plus, we don't even know if the character will be strong enough to carry her own show. I personally think, if The CW want a female-led superhero show, they should use Babs, Zatanna or the Thangarian Hawkgirl instead."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3ammis,DerringerHK,9,Sun Jun 21 20:36:41 2015 UTC,A Zatanna show would be awesome. I didn't know how much I wanted that until now.

I agree with you... it would make more sense to use LoT as a backdoor-pilot, although I guess that's exactly what they're doing. Why not a Caity Lotz driven White Canary-show if they have to make a show with a female lead? We already know what she can do.  On the other hand... I have yet to be disappointed in anything the Arrowverse has spawned, so I have faith in their ability to make the show good regardless."

Booster is Rip's student Spoiler; he might make an uncostumed cameo at least I don't see Booster as a big movie draw.  He may be a big comic book name, but you have to consider how often he has appeared out of the pages.  He was only really prominent in Batman Brave and The Bold; beyond that he had one Justice League Unlimited episode and one Smallville episode.  Add to the fact that a time travel adventure in the DC movieverse (should be) years away, and it makes more sense to place him in the DCW than stick him in a movie where almost no one will recognize him. TV Booster has been done before; Smallville, in its waning days with dwindling ratings, did a decent job in portraying Booster's skill set and attitude.  Given Flash's excellent first season, I think the (network? WB?) will have the budget to throw in a good Booster Gold.  Perhaps Legends could have Michael Carter's growth as a sub-arc, starting with a janitor cameo and finishing with him in the full outfit (just as Rip intended). Given the sheer amount of stars on Legends, it would make sense to have a backup in case someone wants to or has to drop out.  Booster Gold could easily fill in for anyone who goes MIA."

I'm not sure what their plans for the Flash are or why they even greenlit the show, but DC told them to kill plans for the Suicide Squad which is why they killed Deadshot and can't use Harley Quinn as much as they planned cause of the Suicide Squad movie next year. The same reason that Brandon Routh is Ray Palmer and not Ted Kord (like they planned) because Zack Snyder had confirmed the JL movies to eventually include minor DC heroes too. He even confirmed Blue Beetle/Ted Kord. I really worry about the flash TV show when he IS a core member of the JL and that movie is right around the corner.

Because Zack Snyder has confirmed plans to use Ted Kord in the DCCU. The movie universe obviously easily overrides the television universe, if history has proven anything.

LegendsOfTomorrow,388ppq,VirgoDog,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:59:23 2015 UTC,Maybe it will happen early S2 before Legends of Tomorrow debuts? I think having Jason Rusch Firestorm for LoT would be a good move in adding another minority to the team

LegendsOfTomorrow,388ppq,cantletyoubrewthat,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:32:09 2015 UTC,"Although a weird choice. If Ronnie's off the table, but they've already introduced Jason Rusch, why not use him? Or if he's not available, do a quick re-cast like Sara Lance? Or do the bit from when Rusch was first starting out, and have Martin Stein simply need any random second person to bond with in order to become Firestorm? Or have Stein bond with Lorraine Reilly to become Firehawk?  With all of those options on the table, why create an all-new second half of Firestorm?"

LegendsOfTomorrow,37v6mz,Undecided_User_Name,16,Fri Jun 5 11:07:10 2015 UTC,"Holy shit the amount of people expecting Green Lantern to show up is ludicrous.  The CW's budget for its shows are minuscule compared to other shows. That's why we only see around 6 minutes of Barry being The Flash per episode. The CGI needed for Green Lantern would be staggering, especially because they need two or three episodes to set up Hal Jordan, like they did with Barry Allen in Arrow."
LegendsOfTomorrow,37v6mz,yuloforce,9,Sat May 30 23:59:49 2015 UTC,What if they set him up in arrow as the person who taught Oliver how to fly a plane?
LegendsOfTomorrow,37v6mz,dynodanz,10,Sun May 31 14:28:46 2015 UTC,"This is actually quite clever... Doesn't he say in the Arrow finale that ""It's been a while since I've flown a plane"" or something? And he's arriving in Coast City next season... I'm still wholly convinced that they don't have the budget for a comics-accurate Green Lantern, but I could see them doing Hal Jordan this way."
LegendsOfTomorrow,37v6mz,yuloforce,4,Sun May 31 14:40:47 2015 UTC,"Well, he definitely won't be comics accurate when he first shows up.  The chances of him going to Oa, for example, are pretty slim.  Lanterns will have to come to him.  But if they do what they did with Barry, introduce him in Arrow/Flash w/o his powers, then they could gauge the reactions and decide whether or not to give him his own show.  That would allow more money to be spent on CGI.  After the Flash, the 100, Supernatural, the Tomorrow People...I think the CW could pull it off."
LegendsOfTomorrow,37v6mz,ajwhite98,1 point,Sun May 31 16:21:53 2015 UTC,The issue with introducing him without his powers is they would have to do an episode that takes place before we are. They could do something like Arrow and do Flashbacks though.
LegendsOfTomorrow,37v6mz,ExynosHD,0,Mon Jun 8 03:54:53 2015 UTC,"GL's power is to basically create anything he imagines, even with all those shows I still think CW's budget is too limited to accurately portray that. GL's one of the few heroes that I think the movies should exclusively handle just for budgetary issues."
LegendsOfTomorrow,37v6mz,suss2it,3,Sun May 31 16:39:41 2015 UTC,"That's kinda what I was saying.  They won't show everything he can just yet.  But what they can do is show him starting out as a hero.  Shooting lazers, making fists, hitting people with a wall of force.  Start small, get bigger when the budget does."
LegendsOfTomorrow,37v6mz,ajwhite98,2,Sun May 31 17:01:02 2015 UTC,"That's true. We probably can't get any epic space battles and probably no other ring bearers like Sinestro or Star Sapphire, but they could just save that stuff for the movies anyway."
LegendsOfTomorrow,37v6mz,suss2it,2,Sun May 31 17:07:29 2015 UTC,"They could have GL get the ring and lantern, but have the folks from OA take a long time to actually find him and train him. That would give them an excuse to just have him making shields and fire green energy beams as he tries to figure out what he's supposed to be doing."
LegendsOfTomorrow,37v6mz,Goldang,6,Thu Jun 18 05:50:38 2015 UTC,"He was actually introduced before the Green Lantern Corps were around (before the idea had been thought of anyway), he was a Alan Scott villain, the golden age. If they were going to have a Green Lantern villain to introduce Green Lantern onto the show, it wouldn't be Vandel Savage, he is more of a Teen Titan's villain more than anything."
LegendsOfTomorrow,37v6mz,anotherandomer,4,Sat May 30 22:15:39 2015 UTC,Vandal Savage is a DC universe villain at this point. He isn't really tied down to any specific subset of the universe.

LegendsOfTomorrow,37v1ti,Gate4043,1 point,Sun May 31 15:22:24 2015 UTC,I wouldn't exactly call that obscure I remember quite a few shows bringing it up in recent years. I guess because it's quick and potent way to say that people don't really change.
LegendsOfTomorrow,37v1ti,suss2it,1 point,Sun May 31 17:00:39 2015 UTC,I'll take a guess and say the shows had to explain the reference.

LegendsOfTomorrow,37v1ti,Gate4043,0,Mon Jun 1 07:13:43 2015 UTC,"Except the comic Cold is sometimes an anti-hero rather than a straight-up villain. They're not doing anything new or groundbreaking, neither are they building some sort of elaborate subterfuge where a character we grow to trust suddenly stabs his 'friends' in the back. They're just bringing him more in line with the comic book version of the character."
LegendsOfTomorrow,37v1ti,OmegaX123,8,Mon Jun 8 03:21:55 2015 UTC,"I’m excited to explore his shades of gray so we see he’s not just a villain, he’s a man.   I love Wentworth Miller's Captain Cold more than Heath Ledger's Joker."
LegendsOfTomorrow,37v1ti,yuloforce,6,Sat May 30 18:56:52 2015 UTC,That's pushing it a bit but I did vote him as my favourite Flash villain in the poll.   Although I would say I love Wells more than Heath's Joker... But... Idk I'm weird
LegendsOfTomorrow,37v1ti,your_mind_aches,2,Sun May 31 07:10:43 2015 UTC,"Or, we see Citizen Cold. In a weird twisted world similar to Flashpoint."

LegendsOfTomorrow,37v1ti,Ms_Mediocracy,1 point,Sun May 31 01:57:24 2015 UTC,"Epiphany: This universe is Flashpoint! In killing Barry's mother, Eobard stopped her from getting murdered further along the track, which changed things so now Captain Cold is on his way to becoming Citizen Cold, and as there's no Batman, but there is a Wayne, we can assume that Thomas is in charge rather than Bruce, which means it'll be a while before the chaos, which means it'll be a while before we're hit with everything inside Flashpoint.  So, essentially, this universe is Reverse-Flashpoint, as rather than Barry stopping his mother's death, Eobard stops it by going back and killing her too early."
LegendsOfTomorrow,37v1ti,Gate4043,1 point,Sun May 31 15:19:02 2015 UTC,"Good theory but the thing is Eddie died, which caused Eobard to not exist which means....Barry's mother never died. Eddie accidently saved Barry's mother"
LegendsOfTomorrow,37v1ti,Gate4043,1 point,Sun May 31 17:03:04 2015 UTC,"Well, anyways, doesn't matter. Barry reversing the black hole is going to send him back in time right before time starts to get messed with. It's paradox correction; the universe Barry is in is supposed to be destroyed with the black hole, but if it ceases to exist, the thing that stops it will be transported back to the moment time starts to get messed with. Barry's going back to the particle accelerator, just before he taps into the timestream."

LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,TheAmbitious1,21,Sat May 30 15:26:53 2015 UTC,"The 2 most popular theories right now are that he is either playing Cyborg or the new part 2 of Firestorm. Most people are leaning towards Cyborg now as (SPOILERS FOR FLASH) Ronnie is still alive and is implied to have a bigger role in Flash season 2. My (and many others) theory is that Ronnie will guest star in a few big episodes of Legends to make Firestorm, and Stein will mainly serve as the wise mentor of the group (END SPOILERS FOR FLASH). Honestly I haven't seen the Jaden Smith as Static from any source worthy enough for me to consider it anything but rumors as of now, so I am still holding out hope that Jay could still be Static!"
LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,utlonghorn2016,2,Sat May 30 15:37:57 2015 UTC,But there is still a Static show in development
LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,stock_character,4,Sat May 30 15:48:41 2015 UTC,Yeah its supposed to be a web series. Maybe it  will correspond with the Flarrowverse
LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,call_the_eagles,2,Sat May 30 16:21:26 2015 UTC,DCWverse. Flarrowverse sounds too... sparrow-ey? I don't know. I don't like it.
LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,Gate4043,2,Sun May 31 17:38:25 2015 UTC,That's nice but if Supergirl does decide to cross with flash or arrow it would add CBS and if Teen Titans crosses over as well the would add TNT. This would make it the DCWBSTNTverse lol
LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,call_the_eagles,1 point,Sun May 31 20:21:09 2015 UTC,Or the DCTVU. Once it gets that far it can't be a word anymore.

LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,call_the_eagles,1 point,Sun May 31 21:11:00 2015 UTC,Agreed. I always liked DCW.
LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,spennotheclown,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:57:19 2015 UTC,The correct term is Arrowverse just like buffyverse.
LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,soggy_potato,3,Sun May 31 19:07:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed! People need to give Arrow credit where credit is due. Yes, Flash will play a much larger role shaping the Arrowverse than Arrow itself going forward due to Arrow's street-level focus, but as the show that started it all, Arrow at least deserves the privilege of giving the universe its name.  Flarrowverse really does sound terrible. Don't care for that at all."

LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,MainlyPardoo,3,Thu Jun 4 04:58:39 2015 UTC,I know a lot of people think he'll be cyborg but I'm really hoping he's not. I'm hoping for a little bit of a lesser known hero one that they could build with.
LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,call_the_eagles,3,Sat May 30 16:27:29 2015 UTC,"SERIOUSLY do not think it'll be Cyborg, as he's already been cast in the cinematic universe and DC really doesn't like crossing streams."
LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,ultrasargent,5,Sat May 30 19:19:52 2015 UTC,"They're so weird about that. They can't have two versions of the same character on TV and in the movies, but then suddenly we're getting to versions of Barry Allen. Having two versions of Harley Quinn would be a lot more confusing to us?"
LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,VyseNice,3,Sat May 30 20:37:00 2015 UTC,"With three flying characters, one of which shoots beams from his hands and shrink, one of which is one fire and the last one having huge angel wings on her back, I'm kind of thinking they would have to try to add another character which wouldn't bee too costly. Static would be a pretty good guess, but if we're to believe the rumors, and Jaden ""How Can Mirrors Be Real"" Smith is going to take on that character at some point (thanks, Will...), I agree that he's out. I don't think we would have to rule out Black Lightning just because of his age though. He wouldn't be too costly, and is a cool character.  My guess is Cyborg, but then my second guess would be Michael Holt."
LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,VyseNice,5,Sat May 30 20:31:39 2015 UTC,"I still think it's going to be Jakeem Thunder.  He'd be the first real ""magic"" character in the DCCWU, which opens all kinds of doors.  I really, really doubt it's going to be Cyborg.  Not only is he getting his own shit for the DCCU but he's also a lot more related and closer to Titans than anything else and would fit much better over there.    But I mean, DCCWU couldn't use Harley, can't really use Deathstroke, or Deadshot anymore so much so that they wrote them out of the show, characters who are just side characters for the Suicide Squad movie, let alone one of the big 7 that's going to get his own line of solo movies (Cyborg)"
LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,SwishDota,1 point,Sat May 30 17:07:13 2015 UTC,Oooo good catch.  It would fit with the incoming Earth 2/Justice Society thing Flash is building to.
LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,Future_Vantas,1 point,Sat May 30 20:44:18 2015 UTC,"First time I heard about him I thought it was JJ thunder. Would make a lot of sense too, considering he gets the Thunderbolt from Jay Garrick."
LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,Mr_Milenko,0,Sat May 30 17:42:54 2015 UTC,Cyborg isn't one of the big 7
LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,TheWanderingN00b,2,Sat May 30 20:58:17 2015 UTC,"In the DCCU and New52 he is.  He's one of the 7 founding members of the Justice League, and they've already said he's going to fill the same role in the movies."

LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,TheWanderingN00b,2,Sat May 30 21:39:10 2015 UTC,"I tried for a while, but just couldn't do it.  There are some great stories that came out of it, but a lot of it is trash and the continuity is so messed up because it's a half assed reboot instead of a full on one.  The Batman timeline is absolutely fucked for instance.  Somehow he's gone through 4 Robins in 5 years and none of the other heroes bats an eye to it.  But yeah, Cyborg takes the place of Martian Manhunter in the Big 7 in new52."
LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,SwishDota,6,Sat May 30 21:52:17 2015 UTC,Sounds pretty iffy. Replacing manhunter with cyborg sounds like a pretty big fuck up to me. J'onn is one of my favourite characters.
LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,TheWanderingN00b,2,Sat May 30 21:59:02 2015 UTC,"I agree. But I like the fact that J'onn is being left out of the movie universe, because if he gets put on the DCWverse, then it'll show how good a character he can be, assuming they do him correctly. Which I have no doubt they'll do eventually, what with a show about time travel. Also, the guy playing Jay's more or less confirmed Cyborg. A description of a former highschool athlete who was caught in an accident while working at a lab? Come on, man."
LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,Gate4043,1 point,Sun May 31 17:43:40 2015 UTC,"I think ""iffy"" is putting it kindly. Why the fuck would they replace the best superhero? Why? WHY??"
LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,air_jordan1,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:35:00 2015 UTC,Cyborg makes the most sense based of what we know about Jay Jackson origin so far. It pretty much matches up perfectly.

Is he likely to be from the present day timeline, or is he likely to be from some point in the future that the Legends team travels to?  If he's from some alternate time or timeline, would that offer up any new clues as to who he could end up being?"

LegendsOfTomorrow,37uoav,Galorekilla,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:21:17 2015 UTC,The important question to ask here is why hide the true identity of the character. I think he must be Wally West.

LegendsOfTomorrow,37u9lg,AlexCourt389,7,Tue Jun 2 03:30:39 2015 UTC,It can't be that long because Atom is able to shrink in the trailer and talks about when the building exploded and he shrunk to save himself. So it has to be after this seasons finales.
LegendsOfTomorrow,37u9lg,Todrick,3,Sat May 30 13:31:48 2015 UTC,That was fan service... Nothing has been filmed for the show yet.  Just teaser clips for the trailer.  It was ordered to series without a pilot episode being filmed.
LegendsOfTomorrow,37u9lg,LilGyasi,2,Sat May 30 13:59:56 2015 UTC,"Even so, obviously it has to work within the continuity of the show."

LegendsOfTomorrow,37u9lg,americanhardgums,1 point,Sun May 31 16:12:49 2015 UTC,I think they meant the continuity of the Flash and Arrow.
LegendsOfTomorrow,37u9lg,Todrick,2,Mon Jun 1 18:55:53 2015 UTC,"right, that's why i was pointing out that we know these scenes were filmed specifically for the trailer, since no pilot was filmed.  none of this has anything to do with continuity... odds are the rooftop scene we saw wont be used, if it is used, it will be re-shot. Since we know Oliver will never wear that suit again.  I also don't understand this idea that Rip will ""pick people out of out of their timeline""...  There is absolutely zero indication of that. The original idea of that was based on the fact that Sara was alive and people trying to reconcile how that was possible. But since we now know that she is revived in the Lazarus pit... why are people still clinging to this idea?"

I would say they will definitely use some of the trailer footage, if not in the pilot, then in future episodes (the giant robot foot thing). We know Oliver isn't going to be wearing the old suit, but that doesn't mean we won't see the transition, or even see him wearing it for the last time in the opening in season 4."
LegendsOfTomorrow,37u9lg,Todrick,2,Mon Jun 1 20:34:50 2015 UTC,"We know Oliver isn't going to be wearing the old suit, but that doesn't mean we won't see the transition, or even see him wearing it for the last time in the opening in season 4.      Actually, we do know that we won't see that:      Will we see Oliver in the green arrow suit after 3x19?  No.       will Oliver ever put on his suit again?  Nope.       Are you guys planning another Arrow suit upgrade?  Yes.  A big one.  But not in Season 3…"

LegendsOfTomorrow,37fpll,coona93,11,Wed May 27 08:11:42 2015 UTC,"For anyone wondering, in the movie everyone's weaknesses were:  Superman: Kryponite bullet  Batman: Bury him alive (with his dead parents nonetheless. Brutal)  Wonder Woman: Give her a toxen so everyone she see's is her nemesis (cheetah) and she must fight/defeat them all (until her heart gives out)  Green Lantern: Put him in an impossible position where he fails his duty, taking away his willpower  Flash: Strap a bomb to his wrist that will go off if he drops below a certain speed (like on the show)  Martian Manhunter: Set him on fire"
LegendsOfTomorrow,37fpll,sethbenw,9,Wed May 27 17:19:33 2015 UTC,"Actually burying batman alive wasn't a contingency plan, it was just what Vandal Savage decided to do. At the end of the movie when talking to Superman Batman said the Justice League was his contingency plan for himself."

When I was a kid I was a fan of the Wolfman/Perez era of New Teen Titans. The majority of their run they had seven regular characters and other characters came and went.   When Wolfman would try to pair off the group in romantic couplings, it made the group look smaller, but when they each had romance outside the group, it expanded the universe of the characters and by issue fifty when Donna Troy married Terry Long, the environment in which their storytelling dwelled felt infinite. In that instant it seemed like Perez and Wolfman could have gone anywhere with that group and done anything they wanted. Granted, within a couple few years it all kinda went to pot cuz of the Crisis on Infinite Earths thing and DC got all weird and stuff but for awhile it was awesome.   Yes the ""Legends of Tomorrow"" characters will need to have interactions with each other. Some will be platonic some will not. The series would be better served if each of the characters had their romantic interests outside the circle of teammates, to keep the pool of story possibilities from feeling claustrophobic."

LegendsOfTomorrow,37922a,TheMurderCapitalist,-1,Tue May 26 04:53:41 2015 UTC,You can find everything on the internet  But seriously we are just arguing semantics at this point. The DC movies generally have darker tones and less saturation. I'm not complaining or saying that's a bad thing.

LegendsOfTomorrow,37922a,BVTheEpic,0,Tue May 26 02:34:31 2015 UTC,Rip Hunter is a time traveler so the rooftop scene could occur during Arrow season 3 and Flash season 1. Before the finale. In fact Rip may intentionally want to change events in the finales cuz they lead to Savage winning in the future. This may also explain why Hunter didn't stop Reverse Flash from messing with history. His tampering made Flash happen sooner than the previous timeline.

LegendsOfTomorrow,36xolo,Daniel5497,-1,Tue Jun 2 17:11:45 2015 UTC,"But retrieving her body and then bringing it back to the present to revive her wouldn't? No, my friend. The universe is getting a major fucking either way.  You must be thinking that preventing Sara's death in the first place would mess with the timeline, because it would erase most of the happenings in season 3 of Arrow. The whole season's plot was, after all, centred around her death. Right?  But then, if Rip instead revived her now, it wouldn't mess with anything since everything that happened because of her death happened already, correct? Wrong, my friend. Very wrong. He would be messing with things to come, because in an original, untampered timeline, Sara would have remained dead. By reviving Sara, he would be erasing an entire timeline. He would be changing the course of history (to Rip, our present is the past). How then, is that much different from changing history by preventing her death in the first place?  My point being, whether he changed the timeline back then or now, he's still messing with it."

LegendsOfTomorrow,36xolo,Gate4043,15,Mon May 25 15:42:27 2015 UTC,"I think time travel will HAVE to be a factor in her revival. From what fans know about the Lazarus Pits, they don't work on old, rotting corpses. Only the freshly killed/dying.  My thought is that Rip will have to go back to the day Sara was killed and steal her body then. Then the writers will have a choice, because they can't just go use the pits in Nanda Parbat then & there with Ra's in control. They'll have to time travel again, either to the present or future, and work with Ra's Malcolm to bring her back in the pit. They could do an immortal John Barrowman there. Alternatively they could travel backwards in time again, to Nanda Parbat before the League existed, but probably not.  But basically they can't just throw her in and go from there, without some serious 'splainin to do. Lazarus Pits aren't meant to work that way."

LegendsOfTomorrow,36xolo,morganlol,7,Sat May 23 00:33:10 2015 UTC,If I have to deal with Captain lance going on another 10 episode emo-bitch fest I'm going to be pissed
LegendsOfTomorrow,36xolo,ConcedeDota,5,Sat May 23 21:09:24 2015 UTC,"I thought it was out of character for Lance to be willing to work with Oliver. He whitewashed the fact that Oliver killed over twenty people. Lance's turn against Oliver acknowledged that and made it part of the story so it retroactively made that part in season two work. In my opinion, Lance's character arc was the best written thing to come out of this season. Asshole Lance is my favorite.  I made a post in the past justifying the character arc so I will just copy and paste it here.   the show's justification is a lot more layered and complex then most people realize.   Sara's death being hidden made him stop trusting the Arrow. How can he trust someone who keeps secrets from him about his only life? The reason he blames the Arrow is so he doesn't have to blame Laurel so he can forgive her eventually. This is consistent with him blaming Oliver for Sara's first death so he wouldn't have to tarnish his image of Sara. Lance runs to the law whenever someone significant dies. He takes comfort in the safety of a black and white uncomplicated world. When Sara first died, Lance dove into his work to the point where he destroyed his marriage. This time black and white morality causes him to turn against the Arrow, who is a very gray figure.  During ""Broken Dolls,"" Lance talks about how he became obsessed with the Dollmaker because the each victims death was like losing Sara all over again. Lance couldn't get direct justice for Sara's death so he looked for getting justice with things that remind him of her or how connected her to him. One of the entities he blames for Sara's death is the League of Assassins; however, he knows he isn't powerful enough to take them on. He doesn't know anything about how Sara died so he can't get justice for her death. The only thing close to Sara that he can bring to justice is the Arrow. He blames the Arrow for making him give up his black and white morality and faith in the justice system. Previously, he believe the Arrow was doing good therefore, losing this was okay. After the betrayal, he interprets the Arrow differently. He has lost what he held most dear after his family which was the law. Lance always talked about how the law was sacred. Lance made his own choices, but people often try to blame others for their own mistakes. He views this as a mistake because he doesn't trust the Arrow and thus thinks it was all pointless. This is why he considers himself to be a victim to the Arrow. Obviously, this isn't true because the Arrow didn't force him to do anything, but he isn't thinking completely rationally right now. He tells Oliver this in the van in his ""you have turned us into criminals and liars"" speech. ""Grief's got a way of shifting a person's beliefs."" - Quentin Lance Because of the prior reasons. He views everyone else in team Arrow as his victims because the Arrow made them buy into his twisted vision of justice. This includes Sara. Lance groups the crazy comic book world of vigilantes and ninja assassins together; therefore, this is just another reason to blame the Arrow. This is seen in the promo when he tells Roy that he is still trying to save him. He also mentions how all these masks started with the Arrow in his speech to Laurel. He says Sara died because she was part of all this craziness too. In his head, he links the League of Assassins in someway because they both use archaic weaponry. This means he also blames the Arrow for Laurel starting to risk her life as a vigilante. Knowing for sure Oliver Queen is the Arrow seals the deal. Oliver Queen is tied to everything bad that has happened. Oliver took Sara with him on the boat that caused her first ""death"". Mr. Queen's mother was connected to Merlyn's evil plans. Slade Wilson and Isabel Rochev were targeting the Queen family. Sara turned into a killer as a result of the boat incident. You can see why in his grief he might blame Oliver even though Oliver isn't to blame for any of these. This is consistent with his characterization in the past of blaming people in his grief that technically weren't responsible for things because of association. Again this is consistent with his character. Oliver Queen never telling him that Sara was with him on Liana Yu was another reason for hating Oliver Queen. He realizes in this moment how much of Sara's life has been kept from him. This secret is made worse by her death. Lance reveals this aspect of his motivations when he says to Oliver, ""when did you start deciding what was best for my family."" In the Arrow tie-in comic, they really telegraph that Sara is Quentin's favorite daughter in spite of being less like him than Laurel. This another reason that Sara's death hits him extra hard. Quentin has a consistent pattern of blaming others for Sara's death. This isn't out of character at all. Maybe you don't like the character and that's fine. It isn't a case of bad writing because it fits with his prior characterization. Did people ignore his dialogue? He basically explains his motivations.   The logic behind his shift in perspective isn't perfect, but that is by design as his decision making is heavily influenced by his emotions. I think it would have been really stupid and out of character if he hadn't turned against the Arrow. I could probably write an essay about how deep Quentin's character is and how complex his motivations are despite being surrounded by a lot of shallow characters. Reducing it to he wasn't told soon enough about Sara's death is oversimplifying.  A lot of people have been saying that Lance is a hypocrite because he kept Sara being alive from his family. However, these two examples are very different. Sara chose to have her own being alive be kept a secret. Sara is the subject of the secret; therefore, it is part of her moral right to privacy to keep her alive status a secret. Laurel is not the subject of the secret of Sara's death; therefore, she has no right to keep it from her father. Also, hiding that someone's daughter is dead is significantly worse than hiding that someone's sister is alive.  How is this any less believable than a man in grief of his wife's death deciding to blow up an entire section of a city? The people in the glade's are about as responsible for her death as the Arrow is for Sara's.   It confuses me that people expect so much rational thinking from people. If people was anywhere near as rational as people expect fictional characters to be, we would be living in a utopia. The majority of decisions are made in the heat of the moment with emotionally-charged thinking."
LegendsOfTomorrow,36xolo,soggy_potato,3,Sat May 23 21:51:08 2015 UTC,What if it isn't the Sara we know? A Sara from a different timeline where she was never the Black Canary and was always the White Canary?  A timeline where Oliver saves Sara through the pit rather than Thea or something along those lines.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36xolo,thedisgustingbacklog,3,Sat May 23 08:54:30 2015 UTC,"This might sound weird, but I'd like it if this Sara was a result of Flash's upcoming multiverse shenanigans, and the Lazarus Pit is shortly after her death instead of all these months later. That way, they could keep down questions about why they can't bring back Tommy or Moira if the post pit insanity is temporary."
LegendsOfTomorrow,36xolo,Tanokki,3,Mon May 25 03:45:39 2015 UTC,Like she comes from an alternate timeline where she was revived right away by Nyssa?  It would fit with Rip Hunter's modus operandus...

LegendsOfTomorrow,36xolo,spectrosoldier,4,Sat May 23 02:22:41 2015 UTC,"If Sara wakes up with the ""post-Pit-crazies"", I could see her maybe going after Thea for some revenge.  If that happened, it could lead to a Black Canary/White Canary fight, (however things play out, I really hope they work that fight in somehow) where Laurel's trying to protect Thea (her kinda sorta little sister), while trying to incapacitate but not (re)kill Sara (her actual little sister).  Maybe Laurel could unleash the Cry on her, and while she's knocked out lock her up somewhere.  Who resurrects her and why will influence when Nyssa finds out, but if she didn't know beforehand, Laurel would surely contact her at that point.  If she's gonna be a trusted member of TeamLegends by mid-season, I imagine we'd see a resurrection arc for her over a few eps towards the start of the season.  Then maybe Nyssa will take her back to Nanda Parbat for some rehab until mid-season rolls around.  Perhaps?"
LegendsOfTomorrow,36xolo,Phee78,2,Sat May 23 10:48:47 2015 UTC,"Well if they fight and Laurel doesn't unleash the Canary Cry immediately she's going to get beaten, and badly so if Sara is completely unhinged by the pit, given their difference in fighting experience. Now, if Thea and Laurel fight her togheter, and Laurel uses it, then it all become more plausible."

LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,Todrick,1 point,Mon May 25 15:36:09 2015 UTC,Oh ok thanks for clarifying!
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,Blueberry_H3AD,1 point,Mon May 25 16:00:08 2015 UTC,Expect something around October-November if the trend continues as pilot will start shooting around August.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,thilinac,1 point,Sun May 24 00:17:21 2015 UTC,There will be no pilot  It was ordered straight to series
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,Todrick,1 point,Sun May 24 00:48:05 2015 UTC,As the pilot I meant first episode.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,thilinac,0,Sun May 24 09:29:47 2015 UTC,"Oh, OK.... That's not a pilot though."
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,Todrick,2,Sun May 24 14:07:59 2015 UTC,I'd argue that pilot has been used interchangeably for both meanings for quite a long time. But still you are correct. The first episode hasn't been filmed yet.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,Try_Another_Please,0,Tue May 26 22:36:33 2015 UTC,"It has, but only because it's rare that a show is ordered straight to series.  There is almost ALWAYS a Pilot filmed... in many cases nowadays, Pilots are filmed without a full outline for the story of the show... they figure that out later, if the show is picked up based on the strength of the pilot."
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,Todrick,1 point,Tue May 26 23:08:34 2015 UTC,I know what the actual process and definition of a pilot is. It's just got two meanings now and has for years. If you say pilot everyone will know or assume you meant the first episode regardless of if that show actually went through the pilot process.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,Try_Another_Please,1 point,Tue May 26 23:13:25 2015 UTC,This is what I thought a pilot episode was until now.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,SomeRandomProducer,15,Wed May 27 07:52:34 2015 UTC,"Hang on, the Supergirl pilot is leaked? Brb.  PS: didn't that also happen with the flash last year?"
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,PizzaDiavolo,11,Fri May 22 17:01:04 2015 UTC,And Constantine
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,VicPlaybyPlay,6,Fri May 22 17:22:49 2015 UTC,"Good thing it did, though. All of the backlash from the pilot led to them changing the whole series, pretty much. What we got was great! And is still in limbo. Cancelled on NBC and shopping around for a new home."
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,CrystalElyse,6,Fri May 22 21:57:08 2015 UTC,I'm almost hoping CW grabs it just for a 6-8 episode mid season show like Agent Carter. LoT and Constantine for 2.5 months mid season to give arrow and flash a break. That way we might not go weeks with nothing. 12 episodes of Arrow and Flash then 6-13 of LoT and Constantine followed by 11 more Arrow and Flash. Tossing in a few weeks here and there for holidays and we have like 40 weeks of the year with shows minus a couple. I'd be okay with that.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,VicPlaybyPlay,3,Fri May 22 22:09:41 2015 UTC,"Constantine would be a neat way to bring in magic to the DCWverse.  I know Vixen is suppose to play that role, but it'd be great if they focus her story on The Red and the other forces of life (Green, Rot, Machine, etc.)"
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,Future_Vantas,10,Wed May 27 21:37:43 2015 UTC,Well it does seem a little bit like it may not have been a coincidence that both shows got leaked with a similar period of time before them so it is possible it was intentional (or someone is really good at being sneaky over there). If it was intentional it would most likely be to drum up hype.  So if I am not mistaken legends will be airing in January and given that Flash and Supergirl leaked about 6 months early I would guess it would be somewhere around August if it does leak.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,Fiorbeth,4,Fri May 22 13:08:20 2015 UTC,"The thing is both shows aren't even on the same network if I am not wrong. Flash is CW while Supergirl is CBS so apart from both being DC comic tv shows they really have nothing in common.   Also I notice these 'leaks' are happening quite often nowadays with big tv shows, didn't GOT got leaked like 4 episodes a couple of weeks before it officially came out as well. Make me think maybe there is more to it than just 'accident'.   Yh I would agree about LOT, however isn't the filming for the 1st few episodes already done anyway? That means it can really potentially be leaked anytime from now to then."
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,JustAnOrdinaryGirl92,8,Fri May 22 13:12:53 2015 UTC,"They only filmed a trailer for Legends, not a full pilot episode. I wouldn't be surprised if most what we saw in the trailer is redone."
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,Skoden,6,Fri May 22 13:14:32 2015 UTC,Really? They filmed a ton of shit for just a trailer.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,Lavaros,3,Fri May 22 18:41:59 2015 UTC,"Yup. Most of it was test footage though, so we might see elements of the trailer in the first episode."
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,Todrick,3,Sat May 23 08:08:21 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,catlikesfoodyayaya,6,Fri May 22 14:10:38 2015 UTC,Flash is CW while Supergirl is CBS   Well CW is co-owned by CBS and WB
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,AlexHD,2,Fri May 22 18:10:51 2015 UTC,"In a previous article it stated that CW and CBS' marketing teams worked together on how to launch a comic book show. That's how we got a trailer that is very similar to The Flash - reveals almost the whole pilot in a 5-6 minute video. Then the Flash pilot leaked last june, and now it's May this year and the Supergirl pilot comes along. Too many coincidences?"
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,suss2it,1 point,Sat May 23 01:43:43 2015 UTC,They're not on the same network but both are produced by Berlanti Productions and Warner Bros so maybe there's a security breach in one of those. Then again since it's only the pilots that leaked maybe it's an orchestrated movement.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,Sunuvamonkeyfiver,1 point,Fri May 22 15:19:59 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily in the production company. What we saw was what was sent to critics and marketers. They can identify them based on the minute mark at which messages like ""For promotional use only"" appear. So while they didn't leak it themselves, they know who leaked it each time."
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,suss2it,3,Fri May 22 17:52:41 2015 UTC,"Good point. I think the Constantine pilot and The Flash one had it, but I don't think the Supergirl one does. From what I saw it looks like a BluRay rip with no timecodes. It's honestly one of the most HDest and best leaks of a pilot I've ever seen."
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,Sunuvamonkeyfiver,1 point,Fri May 22 17:57:19 2015 UTC,"Yep the quality is pretty awesome for a 'leaked' version, wasn't GOT leaked at 480p lol this is straight 1080p without the uploaders needing to render/edit them. Either way nowadays it is so normal :)"
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,Fiorbeth,1 point,Fri May 22 18:06:27 2015 UTC,Constantine was pretty shit quality too.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,thilinac,1 point,Fri May 22 19:03:13 2015 UTC,What I heard about the networks is that hey ware both owned by the same parent company. So if it is a planned thing then it would make sense from a network standpoint. Plush both are made by Greg Berlanti so again another link.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,SirHoneyDip,1 point,Fri May 22 18:14:39 2015 UTC,Every one of DC shows are done by WB as well ;)
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,rombaldi2260,1 point,Sun May 24 00:15:28 2015 UTC,"Well CBS is the C in CW so they could possibly play nice. Since Supes has been around for a while in the Supergirl show, I feel the only way they could cross over with the Arrow/Flash shows is the multi-verse. Have CW be Earth-1 and CBS be Earth-2. If they ever come to sharing terms, Barry can do some crazy shit to bring them together. Same for the Teen Titans show on TNT. TNT is owned by Time Warner/Turner, where the W in CW comes from."
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,underthesycamore,3,Sat May 30 10:40:12 2015 UTC,"Well, they don't start FILMING till August, so months is the operative word."
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,Somnif,3,Fri May 22 22:52:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe.  I heard the leak of Constantine caused a recast of the female lead.  Maybe these ""leaked"" pilots are testing/proving grounds?"
LegendsOfTomorrow,36vfu9,Gate4043,4,Fri May 22 18:09:33 2015 UTC,"That seems to be the general concensus. However, LoT was ordered straight to series, so technically it won't have a pilot. So, will episode 1 be leaked? Maybe around August, but at this point, I honestly doubt it. Why bother with an intentional leak when there is already so much hype?"
LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,DRiiFTYT,54,Thu May 21 21:09:31 2015 UTC,"Why on earth would anyone think he would be good?  In the trailer he says it best...  ""I can't imagine any future where I would be a Hero""  Which is 100% accurate of the comic book version as well... there is ZERO reason to think that Capt Cold will suddenly be a good guy for any reason.  Capt Cold is not a hero anywhere but Flashpoint... and it's pretty Clear LoT is not Flashpoint.  There are however times where he IS an Anti Hero... When it serves his needs.  He's even been a member of the Justice League."
LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,Todrick,31,Thu May 21 21:15:03 2015 UTC,"He is saving the world, which serves his need. Like in Forever Evil, he didn't want the world to be run by the Crime Syndicate so he went ""good"". I don't think he wants the world to be run by Vandal so he'll go ""good"" again."
LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,sethbenw,20,Thu May 21 22:02:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly... Stopping someone from killing all the innocent people you want to victimize, isn't exactly ""good""  which is what I find so funny about all these peopel who keep asking why Cold is a good guy."
LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,Todrick,1 point,Thu May 21 23:01:11 2015 UTC,Also Rip may have offered some way to pay him.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,Fiorbeth,9,Fri May 22 13:10:03 2015 UTC,"Bingo, I've always saw him as a criminal and thief with certain ethics and very strict rules of conduct. He will also do good deeds if it suits his interests, saving the world/time from Vandal Savage does fit in his interests since it wouldn't allow him to do his thing.   He's even been a member of the Justice League.   More like Luthor is the JL member and Cold is his very well paid bodyguard that tags along. Johns just has him there since he writes the comic and he loves Captain Cold and it shows because it works so good.  His dynamic with Wonder Woman when they fought the Amazo virus for example was really good."
LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,NovaStarLord,2,Thu May 21 23:27:05 2015 UTC,"OK, well, yeah... But he's there, doing his thing for the Justice League.  no reason he wouldn't do it for this team as well."
LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,Todrick,5,Fri May 22 14:56:30 2015 UTC,Even in Flashpoint he's barely a hero...
LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,TheAdam7,6,Fri May 22 00:50:48 2015 UTC,Some might say he's the reverse.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,ecrofdeepS,1 point,Sat May 23 14:45:11 2015 UTC,He is also a hero in Earth 3.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,Zock123454321,8,Fri May 22 02:23:53 2015 UTC,Earth 3 doesn't count since everything there is opposite. Some might say the reverse.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,suss2it,2,Fri May 22 15:26:37 2015 UTC,I meant the Leonard Snart we are discussing here.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,Todrick,1 point,Fri May 22 02:43:53 2015 UTC,No he's not. He's head of security for Luthor.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,vidiyan2857,1 point,Fri May 22 10:37:56 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make him part of the Justice League, he wasn't sworn in like Luthor.  Green Arrow also fought alongside JL in issue 8 but they made it very clear he wasn't part of the team."
LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,vidiyan2857,30,Fri May 22 12:59:27 2015 UTC,Cold is not evil. Very few of Flash's bad guys are. He's a glorified bank robber. Getting recruited to a team built to literally save the world is not out of character.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,andros_goven,2,Fri May 22 13:07:46 2015 UTC,"We all know he was included cause he was a great portrayal in The Flash by Wentworth but for the sake of the fictional world, I think its quite great that he's included. I mean quite an interesting move by CW to do it.  Can't do a Suicide Squad tv show as intended? Fuck you execs, we'll make another show that'll make use of what we have. ....what you've ALLOWED us to have."
LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,FreeWestPapua,1 point,Fri May 22 13:10:42 2015 UTC,I am not implying he was evil prior to LOT but he may quit robbing to become an anti- hero for the team.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,andros_goven,14,Thu May 21 21:48:56 2015 UTC,If anything I see him trying to rob random things as they travel through time and getting caught.

LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,ThatHeathGuy,1 point,Fri May 22 01:30:26 2015 UTC,How do you not know what an anti-hero is? It's basically a hero with villain qualities think Vegeta from Dragon Ball Z or the Punisher from Marvel.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,ZachsMind,12,Fri May 22 21:12:38 2015 UTC,He says he loves the thrill of the stealing or fighting the Flash. He would probably enjoy this. Plus you can't steal stuff if the world gets destroyed.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,duniyadnd,2,Fri May 22 02:28:37 2015 UTC,"Cold is one of those characters who doesn't operate in terms of ""good"" or ""bad."" He does what serves his needs and the needs of those who serve his needs. He's a selfish prick. Always has been. They're actually closer to his behavior in the comics than I expected. You can rationalize with Captain Cold. He listens to reason. He's not a psycho or emotionally unstable.   Yeah he's just a guy with a gun. So was Dirty Harry. So was.. whatshisname in The Dollar Trilogy. There are people even today who believe all you need to be is a guy with a gun if you got a good head on your shoulders. Personally I'd hate to live like that, but it's a very popular concept especially here in the south. I'm surprised Cold doesn't have his own solo show by now."

LegendsOfTomorrow,36suw4,sethbenw,4,Thu May 21 21:28:51 2015 UTC,My bigger issue with him is he's still just a guy with a gun.

In my humble opinion.. Sure we get to see one of the better Flash-characters regularly on a new show, and sure it's fun that he's sort of an anti-hero. ...but the more he and Heatwave works alongside Atom, Firestorm and Canary, the harder it is going to be keeping him villainous in the two other shows, that those characters are related to. Legends of Tomorrow might gain an anti-hero, but Flash will probably be left with a softened up jester - this sort of.. not-good-but-not-bad, cynical but ultimately nonthreatening wildcard. Flash doesn't need one of his greatest villains ever to become the show's version of a Cesar Romero-joker."

LegendsOfTomorrow,36oi3l,ItsNotAPhaseDad,30,Sun May 24 19:19:44 2015 UTC,"Well heatwave comes as a package with captain cold, I reckon that is the only reason"
LegendsOfTomorrow,36oi3l,frodofred,21,Wed May 20 21:57:40 2015 UTC,"Doesn't Firestorm make Heat Wave obsolete? I mean, what can Heat Wave bring to the the table that Firestorm can't?    I KNOW they haven't really demonstrated this on the current live-action TV show(s) yet (only a tiny bit), but Firestorm's abilities aren't really about fire, or heat. Not at all. It's not even about blowing up in a nuclear explosion, even though he's often nicknamed as ""Firestorm: The Nuclear Man."" As seen in this clip from the 30-year-old animated ""Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show,"" Firestorm's powers are REALLY about transmutation. As Wikipedia describes it, ""Firestorm has the ability to rearrange the atomic and subatomic structure of inorganic matter, rearranging subatomic particles to create objects of different atomic characteristics of equal mass. He can not only change and transmute the atomic composition of an object (e.g., transmuting lead into gold of equal mass) but he can also change its shape.""   Heat Wave, on the other hand, is all about the fire. Mick Rory is a pyromaniac, in the comics and in the TV show. He LOVES burning things and watching the fire be born. He would probably stare at Firestorm's head for hours, if you ask me...except he didn't make that head-burning thing happen, and he prefers it if he is the one who creates it. In the comics, Mick Rory was a rival of Leonard Snart/Captain Cold for a LONG time, because one of the reasons Mick loves fire and heat and hates coldness is because as a kid on a class field trip a classmate locked him in a meat locker as a prank. He responded by blocking all the escape routes of the kid's house and burning it down, then ran away...he eventually ends up in Central City as a Rogue, but it's a long time before he and Captain Cold become friends. Then they are BIG friends, and hard to break up.  Rather inseparable.  When casting these 2 roles for The Flash, producers hired 2 actors who were already sort-of that way in real life: the Prison Break co-stars who played ""criminal"" brothers on that 2005-2009 series. And, since Captain Cold is a staple of the world of Barry Allen/Flash, and you can't really have a show about The Flash without Captain Cold, you really can't have one without Heat Wave either...even if Mick's never been as awesome as Snart, the fact is that they are yin and yang, and kinda have to be together. I suspect (and hope!) the TV writers will develop this relationship more over time, and that putting the two characters over in Legends of Tomorrow as regulars will give enough screen time to help develop that relationship better.     Also, one more thing about Mick Rory: he's the classic example of a comic book villain who wants to ""go straight"" but can't seem to stay on the right path (even after studying with monks for a while!). Other villains always seem to tempt him back to the dark side...but he kept trying to quit being a villain several times and be more ""heroic."" In the comics at different times he's had ""good guy"" jobs such as being a firefighting consultant, being an agent for the organization ""Project Cadmus,"" and even working for the FBI.  None of them last, as other Rogues constantly tempt him back to his pyromaniac ways in order to further their own schemes. In the comics, eventually he and 2 other Rogues manage to murder a superhero (no spoilers here), and Mick Rory's tragic tale is complete: he is a bad guy, pure and simple, and will always be on the run from the law.    If this is the story arc that Mick Rory will reflect on television, then his character is PERFECT for Legends of Tomorrow.  Leonard Snart (Captain Cold) is a bad guy. Always is, always wants to be. Doesn't want to be a ""hero"" (even though he sort of becomes a bit of a hero along the way in the comics, and in the alternate universe of the Flashpoint story...but the joke is that he really doesn't change personality at all, not a bit! It's more in how he's perceived by others based on what's going on around them). Yeah, Snart might have a code of honor, of sorts.  But he never aspires to have a ""legit"" job, ever.  But by contrast, his friend and rival (hah! the original frenemies!) Mick Rory/Heat Wave aspires to be something more than he is...and tragically can't seem to get there.  Maybe LoT will finally give him that chance?  Time (heh) will tell.    EDIT: Also, if Heat Wave is obsolete due to Firestorm's presence, won't Captain Cold be obsolete eventually when Caitlin emerges as Killer Frost?  Or wouldn't you rather see both characters, if done well?    .    TL;DR - Firestorm and Heat Wave actually have different capabilities, with very little overlap...the TV shows(s) simply haven't demonstrated that yet. And also LoT is a good place for Mick Rory/Heat Wave to be developed more as a character...both his relationship to rival/friend Captain Cold (Leonard Snart) and his inner desire to overcome his pyromania and be more of a ""good"" guy."
LegendsOfTomorrow,36oi3l,DaveLambert,3,Thu May 21 11:18:42 2015 UTC,Forgot about Citizen Cold. Thank you for the reminder of good times.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36oi3l,Kayras,9,Thu May 21 16:38:33 2015 UTC,Maybe he's death fodder
LegendsOfTomorrow,36oi3l,UncreativeUsername55,4,Thu May 21 01:31:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe he's death fodder     Or at least intended as such, until/unless proven otherwise.    There was a Justice League Unlimited episode, as I recall, with a Viking Ship found encased in Artic ice, and so the story brought in Heat Wave as one of the villains...just so he could A) melt ice and B) fight good guys...JL members.     It's quite possible that from the in-story perspective of the folks assigning missions (Rip Hunter?) that he's brought onto LoT for similar reasons: they need a heat/fire gun for some reason, and Mick's the obvious guy. And then, after that, he fights Vandal Savage's minions.  And if he's ""fodder"" in that respect afterward, that's fine with whoever, as long as he's already served his purpose for otherwise advancing the mission. And if he survives to fight another day, well that's just bonus!"
LegendsOfTomorrow,36oi3l,DaveLambert,6,Thu May 21 11:34:10 2015 UTC,Um he has a sweet gun invented by Cisco.
LegendsOfTomorrow,36oi3l,FlameyFlame,6,Thu May 21 05:32:47 2015 UTC,"Heatwave isn't useless, he has his own unique advantages over Firestorm. Yes being an unhinged wildcard is one of them.  Predominantly though his teamwork with Snart seems pretty phenomenal. As a team, they straight up defeated the Flash, no other context, no clever tactics, just head-to-head outgunned him. Him and Captain Cold working together make a team you do not want to mess with."

Wentworth [Miller, who plays Captain Cold] and Dominic [Purcell, who plays Heat Wave] are on Legends, but they’ll be on Arrow and Flash, too. It’s like a revolving door for all three shows.”"

But using nanotech to cause shrinking makes no sense at all.  Do the nanites shrink too?  Where does the mass go?  I had hoped that he would use his pet white dwarf star to create a kind of pocket universe that he shunts his mass to, thus becoming smaller.  I also hope that they really shrink him down.  What we saw in the preview is Ant-Man territory.  I want to see him travelling on electrons and stuff."

LegendsOfTomorrow,36hkuc,TripJammer,2,Fri May 22 15:28:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, Marvel uses Pym particles while DC has the dwarf star. The Pym particles are what use the explanation of ""shunting mass into another dimension"" as Ant-Man/Wasp shrink, and the opposite as Giant-Man/Goliath grow.

All his weight is concentrated into a single point, which can pack a serious punch, with a good aim he can kill or escape using his small size. He can hide, ambush and there is very less glowing part visible when he can shrink. Iron Man can only shoot lasers(atleast his priority), while Ray can focus his mass and laser shooting energy in small space, he can hit his target similar to how he hit the League of Assasin's plane.  In simple terms, Iron Man is like 'Special Damage' in Pokemon while ATOM is more of a 'Physical Damage' in Pokemon."

LegendsOfTomorrow,36hkuc,LockeNCole,8,Wed May 20 14:15:06 2015 UTC,here's your answer
LegendsOfTomorrow,36hkuc,pjtheman,1 point,Wed May 20 14:26:48 2015 UTC,"Um... it may seem vague, but Mr.Palmer somehow made his energy source(which powered his ATOM suit) way more smaller, smaller the size of the Bees(which he mentioned that he shrinked his whole energy source in the ending of the crossover episode). Assume that his source shrink with him(his suit shrinks with him).  Now from the above point, we know he shrinked his energy source, now imagine a load of those tiny sources (which each one can power the suit) shrinking itself while he shrinks. That's a huge amount of energy.  That's totally insane. But anything is possible in comic universe :P  Edit: You said it was a problem with propulsion system...  If it was a propulsion system we use, then it'll literally burns a hole through his suit and his legs. He must be using some kind of energy which is neither heat not ejecting gas, his propulsion system should make him literally lighter. Maybe it was just meant to maneuver his suit and not really lifting him(he can float!?). When he became tiny, he somehow makes particles around him lighter? It may be a side effect of the explosion? in Arrow season 3 ending."

LegendsOfTomorrow,36hkuc,Viper_H,2,Tue May 19 13:31:51 2015 UTC,"Maybe that's why he can shrink with the suit, the nanotech in his body helps deal with whatever sciency stuff they want to make up."

With that said, I would kill for Ian McShane   But I would love hearing ideas for the role that really surprise. Gustin wasn't who I thought of for Barry Allen back when I heard he was being cast, but now he's perfect.   I guess it comes down to what age they're looking for. They could go younger than we usually see with Savage. It wouldn't be the first time (Wildcat).  A few ideas:   Henry Ian Cusick  Christopher Meloni  Simon Merrells (With their tendency to cast previous Spartacus actors, this wouldn't be too out there)  David Lee Smith - just for the sake of irony, here's the main character from The Man From Earth, a movie about an immortal man."

LegendsOfTomorrow,36b5du,Roranicus01,9,Tue May 19 14:40:17 2015 UTC,"Many are comparing this role to Rory. Rip is so far removed from Rory it's ridiculous. Rip Hunter would perceive The Doctor as a villain and not a friend. Rip has far more confidence than Rory usually showed. I can't imagine Rip giving Amy Pond the time of day. He is married to his work.   Darvill doesn't look like the Rip Hunter in the comics,  but the character is like a first responder. He is like a fireman for time. He is confident without being too arrogant. He is able to instill hope in others who he feels can exact change and make a difference in a positive way. Even when things appear to be going wrong, he doesn't ever seem harried or surprised. Darvill will not be playing Rory here.   I mean Darvill is a fine versatile actor. He can do this."

LegendsOfTomorrow,369tjo,Zanza00,11,Sun May 17 17:57:46 2015 UTC,Thea will too. They could parallel the effects of ressurection with those two characters nicely. Perhaps Oliver will go looking for Constantine to have him help Sara and Thea.

LegendsOfTomorrow,36a2co,BellatorInMachina,9,Sun May 17 17:31:30 2015 UTC,"The Firestorm in the comics wasn't just combustible. Transmutation was his major power. However, this power is very ..well, powerful! it essentially allows Raymond and Stein to take any matter or energy they want and convert it into any other matter or energy they want. Well. Presumably since Ronnie was usually in the driver's seat of Firestorm, he'd use his imagination to decide what to change into what, and Stein's subconscious would do the math to turn the atoms available into the atoms they needed.   This would lead to things like turning guns into flowers or making Plastique's costume air so the explosives in her costume would fall harmlessly to the ground so Firestorm could catch them and fly off with them, while glancing at Plastique's nude body along the way...   Yes he could combust things too but in the comics this was a less impressive part of his capabilities. In fact on more than one occasion Firestorm admitted the flame coming out of his head was more decoration than an actual heat source. More bark than bite.   For television it appears they've seriously curtailed Firestorm's abilities, at least on the outset. The Conway Milgrom Firestorm had full control of his basic powers almost immediately, even being able to concoct his costume from thin air on the fly. Transmutation makes Firestorm almost a god tho. This would get boring real fast when you can disarm all opponents with mere thought. I don't anticipate transmutation being as much an improvisational power. They may want to make it something Stein and Raymond have to actually talk through before they do it, with the understanding that too much matter manipulation is very dangerous. In reality you can't just take oxygen molecules and turn them into sulphur or iron or whatever without some kind of sometimes very dangerous chemical reactions."

LegendsOfTomorrow,369x6d,SemSevFor,4,Sun May 17 18:22:23 2015 UTC,"Right, but then he can show up in the present day as well.  They've been doing that with a lot of characters.  Slade and Sara in Season 2, Maseo and Tatsu this season.  No reason Hal can't show up as GL since we know he's already got the ring, and still be normal Hal in the flashbacks.  They are doing a pattern of a new show every year, and they always have some setup in the other shows beforehand.  Barry was on Arrow before Flash, Most of the LoT characters are already established in either Arrow or Flash, if they establish GL, it's pretty much a given they'll give him the next show, and it makes sense.  A lot of people want it.  I think at the very least, they will show him coming back to earth near the end of next season on Arrow to setup the show.  Then when it starts, it will show him getting the ring and leaving and training, etc."
LegendsOfTomorrow,369x6d,IDGAFWMNI,2,Sun May 17 18:29:27 2015 UTC,"It certainly isn't out of the realm of possibilities, but there are a few other things to considered:  1) The little hints that we've gotten about his existence aren't really definitive evidence or anything; it's entirely conceivable that the writers could just be having a little bit of fun with the fans.  2) While they've done some terrific work with the effects in The Flash, a Green Lantern show would likely have to push the limits even further. Can they handle that on a television budget?  3) There's always the question of whether DC would even allow for them to do it with a new movie version of the character incoming. Of course, they are horribly strange and inconsistent when it comes to determining what's allowed and what isn't. I mean, maybe if they're planning on using John Stewart in the movies, they won't have an issue with giving The CW Hal Jordan? Or maybe that will make them even less likely to do it? We have no idea, but the point is it is entirely possible that the little hints are all that they'll allow.  None of which is to say that there's no chance it'll happen, and I certainly hope it does. I just don't think we can think of it as a certainty based on the inconclusive hints we've been given."
LegendsOfTomorrow,369x6d,nigg_a,2,Mon May 18 10:11:05 2015 UTC,"Only issue is the CGI. Thats gonna be horrible considering that on a movie budget, they couldnt make Green Lantern CGI right, now try doing that on a CW budget. The idea of a Green Lantern TV show is very slim but having Green lantern for an episode of Arrow and then making him leave to go take on the Anti Monitor or Sinestro afterwards and not seeing him again would be cool af and plausible"

They could bring in Hawkgirl, Nyssa, hell even Speedy now, but...without all the others together, it would just seem wrong.  The only way I could see it working is if it was Speedy, Huntress, and Black Canary.  The others would stick to Legends, which seems like it will be a multiple season affair.  But that takes away two major characters from Arrow, so at best it could be a miniseries."

Guggenheim got too full of himself, reading Olicity fangirls' posts screaming that he was amazing for making Olicity happen.  Now, he just keeps that shit around because he actually thinks it's good.  If he has any influence, he'll keep it going.

He was a wi-fi fiend, staying in touch with associates by the very latest forms of mass communication. What particularly baffled investigators was his apparent youth; Damien seemed to be in his early twenties yet was already well-established and well-connected. While opposing one incarnation of the Teen Titans, Darhk was shot to death by Vandal Savage. However, thanks to Addie's blood (which granted immortality), he survived. *  Genius Level Intellect *  7 Appearances of Damien Darhk (New Earth) *  2 Images featuring Damien Darhk (New Earth) *   Quotations by or about Damien Darhk (New Earth) *  Character Gallery: Damien Darhk (New Earth) *  2 Images featuring Damien Darhk (New Earth) *   Quotations by or about Damien Darhk (New Earth) *  Character Gallery: Damien Darhk (New Earth) *  Search this site for:  Damien Darhk · Damien Darhk (New Earth) *  Search the Forums for:  Damien Darhk · Damien Darhk (New Earth) *  Discuss this and other characters on the forums *  Search the Forums for:  Damien Darhk · Damien Darhk (New Earth) *  Discuss this and other characters on the forums Interesting: Category:Damien Darhk (New Earth)/Images | Category:Damien Darhk (New Earth)/Appearances | Damien Kane (New Earth) | Damien Kane (New Earth)/Gallery    Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

LegendsOfTomorrow,3686q3,autowikiabot,1 point,Mon May 18 02:00:19 2015 UTC,"That would be insane. Having the Light be the villians the entite time and finding out at the end of season 4 that Savage Ras and Dahrk orchestrated all of this and there are more part of the light. That would forever fix the idea of Ras being a shitty villian in Season 3 by introducing this grand group of villians. Also. Upvote for saying ""crash"""
LegendsOfTomorrow,3686q3,nigg_a,0,Thu May 21 15:08:19 2015 UTC,"I'm going to get hell for this, but I hope they don't do the Light. Young Justice was a good show, and the villains were entertaining, but they became too intelligent and made the good guys look dumb at quite a few intervals; hence the incredibly frustrating second season climax that left at least half of them at large, with numerous unresolved plotlines."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3686q3,spectrosoldier,6,Sat May 23 02:26:19 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. They could do other Justice League villains after they get rid of him.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3686q3,soggy_potato,3,Sun May 17 04:02:08 2015 UTC,"From what it sounds like, they need to travel through time on various missions to prevent a future event of catastrophic proportions endangering both the world and time itself...  So we know there will be different time periods, and different goals to achieve. These will all be about disrupting/altering the timeline to prevent Savage from gathering together the forces and resources required to achieve his goals. Clearly the man has some kind of advanced army at his disposal, as shown in the test footage, so it won't be easy.  I doubt he will be ""giving them the slip"" on a regular basis, rather building to a final showdown. Popping up and disappearing is rather demeaning for a character of his intelligence and ability. 13 episodes and done, however, is absolutely fitting for now. If you take that out of context, that is something like 10 hours of watching to get to the climax - which is more than any on-screen movie villain gets! Plus, there's no reason he isn't just detained in a specialist facility and then escapes to pop up in another show at a later point."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3686q3,DanArlington,3,Mon May 18 12:11:44 2015 UTC,I hope he has a team of villains to combat each hero. Like what the legion of doom is to the justice league.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3686q3,Colticus,4,Sun May 17 15:18:35 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping it is just 13 episodes for him and done. IMO if they do a season 2, it should have a different cast. Like a different villain would need different heroes to counter them."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3686q3,InfinityRider,2,Sun May 17 18:02:41 2015 UTC,I'm thinking that rooftop discussion in the trailer is actually from an episode of Flash or Arrow considering they start in October and this starts January next year.   We'll likely see a lot of build up on both those shows to this which would include an origin for Hawkgirl as well as any other new members and Vandal himself.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3686q3,rush247,2,Sun May 17 15:30:04 2015 UTC,Savage will probably be an overarching villain if anything else. The main villain for season one then the one masterminding everything and everyone else in the seasons to come.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3686q3,That_one_cool_dude,2,Mon May 18 16:19:46 2015 UTC,I think they should spend each season stopping some major plan he has.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3686q3,ExynosHD,2,Sun May 17 03:22:09 2015 UTC,But the writers have a way of disappointing by making a villain's character all dastardly and diabolical and then he is defeated by something silly. And somehow his plan has a big ass loophole which the protagonists seem to capitalise on..we're talking Vandal Savage here..the writing needs to get better by each episode.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3686q3,suitedupforaction,-1,Sun May 17 07:30:17 2015 UTC,He'll probably be the main villain on all three shows next year
LegendsOfTomorrow,3686q3,jokester1220,7,Sun May 17 04:49:06 2015 UTC,I fail to see how that would make sense at all. There are people that only keep up with one show.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3686q3,SteveBuscemisEyes,3,Sun May 17 05:07:52 2015 UTC,"H.I.V.E, Grodd and vandal are the villains for each show."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,BewareTheBatsie,44,Sat May 16 20:06:41 2015 UTC,"As long as Sara lives, I don't care."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,soggy_potato,43,Sat May 16 20:55:07 2015 UTC,"You're kidding, right? I mean, she never STAYS dead but her track record for being alive is a bit spotty."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,zixkill,15,Sat May 16 21:56:21 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on whether this counts as in independent season or counts into this season of Arrow/Flash, at least if current trends keep up. Basically:  S1: Sara dies :(.  S2: Wait nvm :).  S3: Sara dies :(.  S4: Wait nvm :).  Now, following this logic, should Legends of Tomorrow count as its own season Sara will die in it to be brought back through one way or another in Season five. Should it not do so she will die in Season five and be brought back in Season six."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,iTomes,5,Sun May 17 08:23:35 2015 UTC,I think this just proves to show that Saras ass doesn't quit.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,moelester518,1 point,Mon May 18 00:14:21 2015 UTC,Good.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,ehhh_MACARENA,4,Thu May 21 10:06:51 2015 UTC,Sara's first two deaths were ambiguous.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,soggy_potato,2,Sun May 17 16:35:30 2015 UTC,Dont forget Sara's second death on the Island during the slade vs Ivo ship attack. So Oliver has seen sara die 3 times.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,nigg_a,1 point,Thu May 21 15:10:08 2015 UTC,Exactly what I thought haha
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,Rileyhuh,20,Mon May 18 14:25:09 2015 UTC,Or Purcell wasn't available for filming at the time.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,Cocobender,15,Sat May 16 21:26:09 2015 UTC,I think you're probably right. He's not really needed with Firestorm around.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,bmxkeeler,6,Sat May 16 20:20:25 2015 UTC,This is the biggest piece of evidence pointing towards him dying to be honest
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,Graeme12895,12,Sun May 17 00:19:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah but how often can they use firestorm? I'm guessing firestorm is the last resort.  But Heatwave adds another layer of crazy. I honestly want him to stick around cause both having the same element as an attack isn't the only thing that should be considered.  With that logic, Roy, Nyssa and Speedy shouldn't be around cause they all use bow and arrows. They have something special about their characters. It's even extra special cause Heatwave is a crazy motherfucker so that really adds something to the team."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,FreeWestPapua,17,Sun May 17 01:10:32 2015 UTC,"Like they said in Young Justice- ""We have no quota on archers"".  There's no reason this team can't have two guys with fire powers, if they're both skilled and willing to fight."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,ajwhite98,24,Sun May 17 01:57:08 2015 UTC,"Well Rip Hunter said in the trailer ""you will become legends...well those who survive"" or something like that."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,rovanz,9,Sat May 16 21:00:58 2015 UTC,"I think the exact quote ""Well, in my time you're not heroes, you're legends! At least those of you who survive..."""
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,RageKnify,17,Sat May 16 23:35:40 2015 UTC,"Two different lines.  One was ""In the future, as improbable as it may seem, you people are a team.  Well, those of you who survive...""  The other was ""In the future, none of you are heroes....you're legends."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,ajwhite98,33,Sun May 17 01:54:39 2015 UTC,"I hope he is killed off - so far he has been nothing but a rather uninteresting dude who likes fire, and gets a portable flame thrower."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,jasazick,19,Sat May 16 20:38:28 2015 UTC,That's a valid reason as well. Snart and his sister have received way more characterization than him. His real personality trait is insane pyromaniac.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,RightHandElf,6,Sat May 16 21:50:11 2015 UTC,"He might be able to pull off comic relief by suggesting fire as a solution to everything.  ""There are a bunch of enemies on our boat."" ""Let's burn it."""
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,pboy1232,8,Mon May 18 02:04:40 2015 UTC,This could get reall funny very quick.  Ray talks about hacking some computer files/fixing some sort of tech and in the background you just see heatwave smile and raise his gun before frowning and lowering it as a solution is reached
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,atomic1fire,1 point,Mon May 18 02:56:14 2015 UTC,"So Heatwave is the team's Harley.  Rip: We need to free the hostages.  Heatwave: Okay I'll start a fire and.  Rip: No, we're not starting a fire.  Later:   Rip: HEATWAVE, SET IT ON FIRE  Canary: Why isn't Ronnie here?  Rip: Bringing him in would interfere with the timeline.  It would be funny if every episode heatwave is setting something on fire.  Hawkgirl: Is he seriously making a smore inside the building, that's not even firesafe.  Heatwave: I wanted a snack, and I like fire."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,Ando_11,9,Tue Jun 2 11:54:53 2015 UTC,"You might be right. Snart seems like someone who could be an anti hero, but Rory is to violent."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,disabledquarter,8,Sat May 16 20:26:47 2015 UTC,Doubt it. Probably just couldn't find time to make it to the filming. This show will have a sporadic cast... So maybe some episodes
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,Rad_Spencer,6,Sat May 16 21:57:06 2015 UTC,"They had limited resources to film this trailer, my guess his lack of screen time was more about do to scheduling conflict then a desire to kill him early on."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,BVTheEpic,4,Sat May 16 22:23:12 2015 UTC,"I think Hawkgirl will die, but then be revived because of her resurrection reincarnation curse."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,VirgoDog,6,Sat May 16 22:57:43 2015 UTC,"It reincarnation, which is totally different."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,BVTheEpic,3,Sun May 17 07:52:51 2015 UTC,"That's what I meant, thanks."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,ZachsMind,4,Sun May 17 14:41:17 2015 UTC,"This may be the starting lineup. It doesn't have to stay this way. i'm not entirely convinced both Cold and Heatwave are on board permanently as good guys. This may be just to get the ball rolling, and get audiences to tune in to LoT by putting as many popular characters from Arrow & Flash on LoT as possible, but as they introduce new characters in the narrative of the new series, they can drop others from the roster. I'm not saying I assume either Heatwave or Cold will be killed off. Tho that's possible too, doesn't feel like this 3rd show is going to be so dark it'll kill more than maybe one or two characters per season, if that.   Snart is going to look for an angle he can abuse and then betray them at his first opportunity. Perhaps Rip Hunter's even aware of this (being from the future) and is factoring it into his own plans."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,Alexander_G127,4,Sun May 17 05:13:07 2015 UTC,"Very possible, he's the one I'd peg as dying. Although with how they group him with Cold it may just be that Cold is far more interesting. Where Heatwave is more just, a psychotic pyromaniac without much personality."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,thunderingtyphoons,3,Sun May 17 16:27:45 2015 UTC,Surely they won't kill him off so soon. He needs to be part of the Rogues lineup on The Flash whenever they inevitably form.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,selfiejon,3,Mon May 18 16:41:22 2015 UTC,Well also the trailer isn't official film from the show. They haven't started filming yet.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,selfiejon,2,Sat May 16 21:32:06 2015 UTC,They've filmed some parts. I really doubt the bits with all those troops and whatever that robot foot was are going to be included in Flash this week.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,CaityKicksAssLotz,3,Sat May 16 21:51:14 2015 UTC,"http://comicbook.com/2015/05/14/dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-to-being-filming-in-july---but-with-a-tw/   The show, the third in the DC Comics TV Universe that has been established on The CW will also begin filming sooner rather than later, in July, in fact – but there’s a twist.   The trailer was 'test footage', in a way. But I do agree that they could kill of Heatwave."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,Avenger990,1 point,Sat May 16 22:24:34 2015 UTC,"They probably plan to kill him when the group is beginning. Showing him less, they don't outright push him so people aren't as mad when he dies."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,AWorldW-OShrimp,3,Sun May 17 00:54:26 2015 UTC,"While I don't doubt the possibility of this happening, I've read that most of the stuff in the trailer was shot specifically for the trailer. It could be that the actor who played heatwave wasn't able to film, or of course the possibility that his character was killed off."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,mrglow,3,Sun May 17 03:17:02 2015 UTC,"I doubt that anyone will actually die on this show, to be honest. Not the kind of tone that they seem to be going for."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,TruemanATED,3,Sun May 17 03:42:00 2015 UTC,"It would be annoying to have Heatwave die in a show that isn't The Flash, too. Especially if the Rogues will still be appearing in Season 2."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,spaceageclockwork,3,Tue May 19 04:41:36 2015 UTC,"He is easily replaced by Firestorm too, so that's a possibility"
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,LabKhan,3,Sun May 17 09:53:32 2015 UTC,"Hawkgirl wasn't in it much, either (if you don't count the CGI shots)."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,mrglow,2,Sun May 17 18:32:08 2015 UTC,But she was still in it.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,Voidrith,3,Sun May 17 19:28:45 2015 UTC,To me the whole trailer just felt like a promo shoot.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,KimJongPooonn,3,Mon May 18 11:09:56 2015 UTC,It was. They haven't actually started filming the new stuff.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,CaityKicksAssLotz,2,Tue May 19 04:40:40 2015 UTC,"I think Sara will die  and come back  and then die again.  Over, and over, and over..."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,JoshuaKevinPerry,4,Sat May 23 07:12:54 2015 UTC,"I'm glad Sara's back but it's kind of annoying that she's ""died"" like six times."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,Lavaros,7,Sat May 16 23:36:04 2015 UTC,"3 times to be correct. Once on the Gambit, on the Amazo and then the rooftop.  But I see your point kinda weird for her too keep reappearing."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,Lavaros,5,Sun May 17 00:52:15 2015 UTC,"Does the lethal dose of poison to escape the league, count?"
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,That_one_cool_dude,4,Sun May 17 04:36:09 2015 UTC,"Nope. She took the poison but it didn't kill her, nor did anyone think she was dead by the end of the episode."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,LockeNCole,2,Sun May 17 08:39:50 2015 UTC,It's possible. But I doubt it. The footage for the First Look Trailer was shot specifically for it. It's possible that Heatwaves actor just couldn't find the time to come back for the trailers filming.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,AgentChris101,3,Sun May 17 08:38:46 2015 UTC,What about Rip Hunter he could die early on. Then use time travel to return. Hell Darvill is an expert in doing weird shit like that.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3672es,AgentChris101,4,Mon May 18 16:21:36 2015 UTC,At least he won't have to stand guard for 2k years this time around.
LegendsOfTomorrow,367ffv,zixkill,9,Sat May 16 22:06:41 2015 UTC,Doesn't a boob window make it bad armour though? It gives the enemy a large unprotected target.
LegendsOfTomorrow,367ffv,ChiefTyrol,8,Sun May 17 00:06:44 2015 UTC,"It also gives a person something to grab on to, like long hair. Makes it very easy to throw a person off balance."
LegendsOfTomorrow,367ffv,NicholasCajun,5,Sun May 17 01:01:32 2015 UTC,"Also the stark contrast of her black suit to her pale skin made the boob window easy to spot. Completely ruins stealth when you have the contrast of colours.   A single colored suit, whether black or white (or green, nazy blue, brown, any other stealth colour), is far more practical for an assassin attempting to be stealthy."
LegendsOfTomorrow,367ffv,GrumpySatan,9,Sun May 17 03:00:36 2015 UTC,"If I were writing this, part of why I'd have her in white is cuz she's no longer interested in stealth. She has died and come back. Why be stealthy? No more hiding in the shadows. This canary comes at you no holds barred with talons out. Unlike Sara in the past who was trying to hide from everybody, this one doesn't care anymore.   Hiding didn't work. So she's trying something new."
LegendsOfTomorrow,367ffv,ZachsMind,3,Sun May 17 06:04:30 2015 UTC,"Also the League isn't hunting her anymore, so no need to hide anymore."
LegendsOfTomorrow,367ffv,rebeltrooper09,3,Mon May 18 05:07:32 2015 UTC,These costumes could just be for the trailer. Let's home it's back.  Since Oliver is wearing arrow stuff it might mean they get a wardrobe change like him?
LegendsOfTomorrow,367xkx,theamazingsashagrey,11,Sun May 17 01:04:37 2015 UTC,You left out Static (Shock)
LegendsOfTomorrow,367xkx,Todrick,6,Sun May 17 01:58:16 2015 UTC,"Jay was one of those three characters who ""had never been in live-action"" before.  Static hasn't been yet, but he is getting his own webseries soon.  Unlikely that he is on two different shows with two different actors.  I'd love to see Kaldur, but I'm going to have to go with Wally."
LegendsOfTomorrow,367xkx,ajwhite98,4,Sun May 17 14:58:13 2015 UTC,Yes but sadly we have heard NOTHING about that web series at all.
LegendsOfTomorrow,367xkx,LilGyasi,3,Sun May 17 23:59:46 2015 UTC,"Static, Kalder, or Cyborg would be the greatest thing of all time"
LegendsOfTomorrow,367xkx,nigg_a,9,Thu May 21 15:13:15 2015 UTC,"The JJ name and the African American actor always made me think Martian Manhunter. He isn't taken by the new set of movies, but I don't think the TV universe is ready for him, so its probably not."
LegendsOfTomorrow,367xkx,PlaidKing,3,Sun May 17 23:58:44 2015 UTC,"This is Legends of Tomorrow we're talking about. Each episode will have at least twice the budget of Arrow or Flash, and Martian Manhunter was already portrayed (pretty well, mind you), on Smallville."

LegendsOfTomorrow,367xkx,CharlieWins,3,Sun May 17 20:26:35 2015 UTC,The trailer had speedster lightning in near every scene. Is Barry taking such a huge spot beside them for Legends? This makes me think Jay COULD be Wally West.
LegendsOfTomorrow,367xkx,Kayras,2,Thu May 21 17:00:03 2015 UTC,This one is a little out there but what about Jay Garrick?
LegendsOfTomorrow,367xkx,TheTransmon,1 point,Thu May 21 17:45:36 2015 UTC,"Since he wasn't in the trailer I just assume he will be Vandal Savage and ""Jay Jackson"" was just a throw-a-way name."

LegendsOfTomorrow,365zlq,Raisdemort,16,Sat May 16 14:00:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'll blame her for all the events of the past year. Except if somehow she was resurrected the whole time and stayed hidden somewhere (very unlikely). I guess he'll be happy she's alive. I really wonder if he'll tell the truth to the Lances. The exact same secret was already used twice... but I could see Ollie think ""Why tell them if she's going to fight an immortal dude, maybe even time travel a little bit, meaning she could very well die at any time?"""
LegendsOfTomorrow,365zlq,Airsay58259,12,Sat May 16 15:53:14 2015 UTC,He can't tell Lance as Arrow and nor as Oliver.  As in Lance isn't on terms with Oliver and the Arrow is 'dead' :'(
LegendsOfTomorrow,365zlq,CaityKicksAssLotz,7,Sat May 16 16:00:09 2015 UTC,Yes... but Laurel?
LegendsOfTomorrow,365zlq,Airsay58259,6,Sat May 16 16:04:40 2015 UTC,Sure tell her :)
LegendsOfTomorrow,365zlq,CaityKicksAssLotz,9,Sat May 16 16:10:26 2015 UTC,But then... wouldn't Laurel tell her dad? We don't need another secret between them (which is actually the same secret... lol Sara is the Kenny of the Arrowverse)
LegendsOfTomorrow,365zlq,Airsay58259,2,Sat May 16 16:16:07 2015 UTC,Ah true. Not sure then. It'll be interesting too see how they deal with it...
LegendsOfTomorrow,365zlq,CaityKicksAssLotz,0,Sat May 16 16:18:56 2015 UTC,But Laurel always keeps secrets!  Honestly I'm surprised she didn't go to her dad right after she found out about Oliver. 'Dad! Dad! You'll never guess what I just found out!' 'Oliver is the Arrow?' 'Uh....no.' slinks off
LegendsOfTomorrow,365zlq,zixkill,3,Sat May 16 21:47:16 2015 UTC,".........Huh? Why couldn't he tell him as Oliver, exactly? Lance knows who he is, regardless. The only thing he'd have to be careful of is whether or not Lance had the place bugged to catch his confession."

Also, should he tell at least Laurel or will they (writers) keep her family out of this series? I wish tomorrow was January :(."
LegendsOfTomorrow,365zlq,Airsay58259,2,Sat May 16 16:05:37 2015 UTC,I'm really crossing my fingers for a Black and White Canary reunion so I hope someone tells Laurel.
LegendsOfTomorrow,365zlq,rovanz,8,Sat May 16 16:25:11 2015 UTC,Let's hope Sarah's Lazarus efects last more than Spoiler since Sarah was dead for a longer time.
LegendsOfTomorrow,365zlq,Internetrovert,7,Sat May 16 21:14:09 2015 UTC,They've said the lazarus effects don't show up until season 4.

LegendsOfTomorrow,365zlq,rush247,2,Sat May 16 22:30:34 2015 UTC,I'm surprised people are making a big deal out this still.   As far as the comics are concerned if you hadn't been dead long then the affects are temporary.  Since Thea had only been dead or on edge for a few hours it fits fine.
LegendsOfTomorrow,365zlq,CaityKicksAssLotz,1 point,Mon May 18 10:46:30 2015 UTC,How do we know she was dead for a long time? The fact there's a time traveller could indicate her being picked up as soon as she was buried. She spent a while in the freezer tho...
LegendsOfTomorrow,365zlq,Rover16,2,Sun May 17 00:57:40 2015 UTC,"But if Rip Hunter could pick up her body as soon as she was buried, why wouldn't he just time travel to the rooftop and save her from being killed in the first place and then not needing to use the pit?  Also, you can't just use the pit behind Ra's back while he's alive, so he needed to die for there to be an opportunity to use the pit."
LegendsOfTomorrow,365zlq,CaityKicksAssLotz,2,Sun May 17 01:10:25 2015 UTC,If he saved her he would truly fuck up the timeline and cause an alternate timeline and time would find a way too kill her otherwise.  And true maybe he waited for Ra's to die. If it was him he probably would wait.
LegendsOfTomorrow,365zlq,Rover16,2,Sun May 17 01:18:59 2015 UTC,True he would fuck up the timeline if he saved her from the rooftop since all the Ra's stuff was put in motion by her death.

But if it's actually utilised I dunno."

LegendsOfTomorrow,362ub1,ZachsMind,0,Sat May 16 22:42:34 2015 UTC,Well so much for my hope this was a tv version if Crisis in multiple Earths. Presumably all the players are from the Flarrowverse.
LegendsOfTomorrow,362ub1,cesclaveria,5,Fri May 15 20:16:09 2015 UTC,"All the main ones right now seem to be from the Flarrowverse but their time traveling adventures may make them cross with alternate timelines and multiple heroes, probably after a season or 2 we may get a few supporting characters from different Earths. They just need to start with something familiar before going deep into the weirdness."
LegendsOfTomorrow,362ub1,ZachsMind,2,Sat May 16 02:26:51 2015 UTC,"Good point. it's just i'd buy the use of Cold & Heat more if they were from an ""Earth Three"" where good guys are bad guys and vice versa. The characters established in The Flash do not look like team players to me. I'm not convinced they're gonna play nice with the other children.   Likewise, I'd buy Sara Lance being back more if they kept the original Sara dead and this Sara was from an alternate reality in which Oliver took Laurel on that boat instead of Sara, and they're both dead now and Sara was protecting Starling City with the help of Wildcat and Nyssa.   You're probably right in that we want to keep the characters familiar with the established audience, but i can dream. I woulda kept Palmer and Stein from the Flarrowverse: ""our"" Stein & Palmer. However, the characters Rip Hunter gets could come from anywhere. Perhaps say they are survivors of alternate Earths which have been destroyed, and Rip Hunter's asked them to help him keep the Flarrowverse from being the next to go. We know a major crisis happens in 2024 wherein Flash goes missing. I was hoping Legends' series arc was going to address that. Rip Hunter could be trying to prevent that event from happening (since Reverse Flash wants it to happen, I rather imagine any ""good guy"" time travelers would not), but everything they do inadvertently over the course of the series seems to just drag them reluctantly to that event."

He's been screwing things up already, and Rip's totally oblivious to it? Too busy messing with the immortal caveman?   I'm not sure if the writers of these shows are actually thinking temporally as they write time travel into these storylines. There are already multiple alternate temporal realities going on due to events on The Flash and the writers are just ignoring them. Unless they're saying Flash always got his powers due to Wells' tampering and his trip through time, getting stranded in the past, was always meant to be? I mean so Flash does something in his future to tick off Wells enough to become Reverse Flash, go back in time to muck up Flash's parents' lives, and this causes him to get stranded in the past, making him have to create the accident that would turn Barry Allen into the Flash so that he can go home? We're led to believe there was never a timeline in which this didn't happen? And how can the future Wells goes back to not be totally different now from the one it was when he left, for all the mucking around in the past he's been doing?"

What we need is a Hawkwoman. Flashpoint Hawkwoman, to be exact.  In a world where Batman is an old and tired of everyone's shit, Themyscians are tearing Europe apart, and Aquaman could solo the mainstream Justice League, Hawkman and Hawkwoman somehow manage to be the baddest asses in a world full of them. It's like someone took two models, gave them the rage of Kratos, the brutality of Conan the Barbarian, and hulking electrified magic alien weapons. They have the coolest costumes, most brutal fighting styles, and the most casual violence of pretty much any Elseworlds characters.  And yes, I am still extremely salty that they were beaten by Nightwing and Oracle in Convergence. Those two should've won. Dammit Gail Simone."
LegendsOfTomorrow,362f82,dark_ice17,2,Sat May 16 00:47:38 2015 UTC,"I think they're going with classic Hawkgirl, ala Blackest Night era. In the trailer it said she has a ""past lives complex"", which is in tune with that version of the character. I doubt they're going to make her from Thanagar but they are in their own universe, so they can do what they want. Personally, I love Earth 2, so I would be fine with that costume."
LegendsOfTomorrow,362f82,dark_ice17,3,Fri May 15 16:50:39 2015 UTC,"It'd be cool if they used the classic origin, but with this costume. I think it would work much better within the universe."

It includes a lot of recap of his history. He has sporadic appearances in the 90s JLA title that are fun. Rip Hunter: Booster Gold's second volume heavily features Rip. It starts with Booster Gold: 52 Pick-Up  Vandal Savage: He appears in many things as the main villain. I'd recommend the animated movie Justice League: Doom. My favorite comic story is the Arsenal mini-series. Sarah: Created by the show and the White Canary from the comics has almost no relation. but she appears in Birds of Prey: Endrun   These are just my suggestions for stories that give a good context and understanding of the characters."

LegendsOfTomorrow,3624di,edujvp,1 point,Fri May 15 16:11:18 2015 UTC,"I have no read that, but I will check it out. Would you say elements of it are present in what we saw in the trailer?"

LegendsOfTomorrow,3624di,edujvp,2,Fri May 15 20:09:17 2015 UTC,Captain Cold and Heatwave are a part of the Rogues and are featured prominently as Flash villains. Look up best Rogues stories on google and I guarantee that you'll find some good stuff.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3624di,walterpinkman45,2,Fri May 15 15:28:13 2015 UTC,I would also suggest reading some Ted Kord Blue Beetle as aspects of that character were merged into the Ray Palmer character.

LegendsOfTomorrow,3624di,ZachsMind,4,Sat May 16 01:59:22 2015 UTC,"There is no single book to read, this team of characters is unique.  Rip Hunter appears in the 2007 Booster Gold run frequently, and the stories usually involve lots of time travel. Good place to start for time travel in the DC universe.  Hawkgirl and Hawkman had a major story involving reincarnation and their previous lives in ""Brightest Day,"" I don't know any better examples for Hawkgirl's reincarnation stories.  Captain Cold and Heatwave shine brightest during ""Forever Evil: Rogue's Rebellion."" Captain Cold stars and leads the rest of the Rogues to save Central City when the Flash and the Justice League is missing.  White Canary is a new concept, the best way to understand that character would be to watch Arrow.  I don't know any good comics for Martin Stein, the Atom or Jay Jackson. If you watch Arrow and the Flash, you probably have a working understanding of the Atom and Firestorm.  EDIT: For Vandal Savage, watch the Justice League: Doom animated movie."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3624di,BooksAgain,3,Fri May 15 15:34:24 2015 UTC,Captain Cold leaves the Rogues pretty quickly to go help Luthor. That book IS great though and features many of the other Rogues including Heatwave.
LegendsOfTomorrow,3624di,Hellstormer,1 point,Fri May 15 19:03:21 2015 UTC,"I think the intention here (as with Flash & Arrow) is to create a series that echoes the source material so it appeals to those of us familiar with comics, but it's also supposed to attract people who would never pick up a comic book. You shouldn't have to read comics to keep up with what's going on.   There's a lot of changes to Professor Stein for example that I'm kinda torn about, but they work with what the franchise needs. Frankly I'm glad they didn't just write him out entirely and start Firestorm off as two young guys to appeal to the young girls demo. And to be honest, alcoholic Stein was a major pain in the butt, back in the day. So what we have on the screen is probably for the best. I miss the Al Milgrom suit, but that really wouldn't fly today. It was a bit over the top even back in 1978. At least the atom design with the three electrons on the chest is still kinda sorta there. They tried to preserve what they could. It's not my Firestorm but it's a good effort.   You're probably better off only knowing about these characters from what the show itself presents to you. Less confusing that way."

I'm more of a Marvel guy, but I enjoy the shows DC has been putting out, and while I have a lot of issues with Man of Steel as a film, it has its good parts.  Plus, Batman: Arkham is amazing, and the DC cartoons have beat the Marvel cartoons, specifically with Young Justice and Green Lantern. Spectacular Spider-Man is the best Marvel cartoon, and I loved it on par with Young Justice, and I liked EMH! well enough. I haven't really tried the new Marvel cartoons but I've heard they're really terrible. The new DC ones don't sound that great either, but, what can ya do. (Plus Vixen is coming)"
LegendsOfTomorrow,362k11,Jexx212,8,Fri May 15 21:40:58 2015 UTC,Every comic book character that has ever or will ever exist is a rip off of something. That's just how it is.

At least once he gets the shrinking abilities, he'll be a version of the Atom able to hold his own in a fight.  Honestly, the only thing that felt like a rip-off in the trailer was the part were Stein was essentially reciting the ""Let's do a head count, shall we?"" bit from The Avengers, but applied to this team."
LegendsOfTomorrow,362k11,ExynosHD,2,Sat May 16 07:44:03 2015 UTC,I don't see how Iron Man is relevant to the comic introduction of Atom. He was completely different in the comics to Iron man.

Likely, he's a consultant, or like Doc to Marty. I don't doubt we'll see Ronnie, or maybe even Jason, in the near future. We do eventually expect to lose Ronnie, for the Killer Frost arc, so we may well see Jason or the both of them.

Not sure how many superhero TV shows I'm going to have on my schedule for next year, but I'll figure out a way.  Few things that annoyed me about the trailer:  1) Why spoil Sara's return? It could have been such a great moment to build up to in the first few episodes. She's a great character, one whose loss I feel hurt Arrow this season (But that's a different discussion for a different time).   2) Why spoil that Ray didn't die? I mean any of us who know him from the comics already knew that, but again, this is something they could have build up to. Or is this just to make sure they won't be labeled the copy cats next year after Ant-Man is out?  3) The very Marvel-esque moments from the trailer. ""Why did you have to ask?"" and Sara splashing out of the Lazarus Pit both felt like things taken straight out of the Age of Ultron trailer.  Anyhow, I have had problems with certain usage of CGI in Flash lately, but this trailer looked pretty decent on that front so hopefully it won't disappoint.   Exciting times."
LegendsOfTomorrow,35zbg8,MessiEsque,3,Fri May 15 12:22:56 2015 UTC,The conspiracy theorist in me suspects this trailer was seruptitiously a message to R.

LegendsOfTomorrow,35zbg8,SawRub,3,Sat May 16 15:29:24 2015 UTC,Are you referring to the fact that it was Victor Garber rather than R. Amell as Firestorm. Is something going on with his agent?

If Amell's agent is holding oit for more money, the writers may have to incorporate Jason sooner than expected.   However they are intentionally revealing a lot about the other characters. Seems strange they are hiding Jason and Ronnie but putting Stein out there. If I were show runner I woulda saved the White Canary reveal for the premiere. That might have already leaked, so it didn't matter to reveal that in the trailer. If you look carefully tho, only shots in trailer of Firestorm are far away. They intentionally don't want us to know if it's Ronnie or Jason or someone else entirely merging with Stein.   Just seems weird to reveal so much about the other characters and dummy up about that. Doesn't feel like it's being done to get us to talk about it. Feels more like they honestly don't yet know themselves ."

I'm glad that this show exists because it gives the side characters a chance to shine without crowding up the other two series. Like Ray.

LegendsOfTomorrow,35z5wy,BallisticGE0RGE,3,Thu May 14 21:29:48 2015 UTC,That's a good theory but still she's been a rotten corpse for about a year and as far as the comics are concerned if the body is too old or too damaged the pit won't bring them back.  I know this is a different universe and all but still it doesn't seem likely that they would deviate that much....although a lot of Arrow was way different from the comic in so many ways this season I guess they could do it like that.

LegendsOfTomorrow,35z5wy,rush247,1 point,Fri May 15 07:43:09 2015 UTC,"Thomas Wayne (New Earth) (from Dc wikia):         * Death is powerless against you if you leave a legacy of good behind. Death is powerless against you if you do your job. My father saved the lives of over four thousand people, one at a time... with his bare hands and his mind. Death was with him the entire time. *  --__ Bruce Wayne __ src  --__ Bruce Wayne __ src Dr. Thomas Wayne was one of the most respected patrons in all of Gotham City. He inherited his family's ancestral home Wayne Manor and took charge of the family business Wayne Enterprises. A skilled surgeon and philanthropist, Thomas Wayne also established the charitable Wayne Foundation. He was the husband of socialite Martha Wayne and the father of Bruce Wayne, the future Batman.  Some thirty odd years ago, Thomas and Martha were traveling across the Midwest when they witnessed a glowing light falling from the sky into a nearby field. Thomas went to inspect the item and discovered a strange alien crystal. Upon physical contact with the artifact, his consciousness was transported through space and time to the planet Krypton. There, his astral self met Kryptonian scientist Jor-El. Jor-El explained to Thomas that the item he discovered was a Kryptonian probe, one of dozens that he had sent out throughout various yellow-sun star systems. He told Thomas of the pending destruction of Krypton and that he was searching for a suitable world in which to send his infant son Kal-El. Jor-El instantly developed a fondness and respect for Thomas Wayne and because of him determined that Earth was the perfect world to send his son. He then sent Wayne's subconscious mind back into his body on Earth.  Only a few months later, Thomas and his wife Martha gave birth to their only son, Bruce. Thomas never forgot his astral experience on Krypton and began writing a journal of his experiences. Still in possession of the Kryptonian probe, he reverse-engineered the technology and was able to use some of it to save Wayne Enterprises from bankruptcy. Nobody ever knew about the alien heritage from which the thriving company prospered from. Thomas was careful that his journal would never fall into the wrong hands, so he hid it in a secret grotto in the caverns beneath Wayne Manor. He always intended to give the journal to his son so that he might learn the truth about the family's legacy. When Bruce was still a young child, his family attended a costume fundraiser. The theme of the party was ""Creatures of the night"". Thomas Wayne decided to masquerade as a bat, and wore a costume consisting of a pointed mask, and large, dark blue scalloped wings. The impressionable Bruce admired his father's outfit and openly asked if one day he might be able to wear such a fearsome costume. Thomas had no idea how prophetic the innocent question truly was. During the party, several gangsters raided the mansion and recognized that Wayne was a physician. Kidnapping him, they brought him to an old warehouse where he was to perform emergency surgery on mob boss Lew Moxon who had been suffering from a serious gunshot wound.  Wayne knew that once he removed the bullet from Moxon's body, the gangster would likely kill him. Instead of performing the surgery, Thomas dove into the gangsters and managed to apprehend every one of them. He called the police and handed the thugs over to a young police lieutenant named James Gordon. The courts sentenced Moxon to ten years in prison.  Moxon only served a few years in jail and upon release, he decided to pay a visit to Thomas Wayne. With a menacing sneer, he glibly told Wayne that he would find a way to get even with him – even if he had to use somebody else to do his dirty work.  Thomas Wayne was also a close colleague of Roger Elliot, another influential businessman. Together, the Waynes and the Elliots were considered one of ""First Families of Gotham"". At this time, Bruce Wayne befriended Roger and Marla Elliot's son, Thomas. Thomas Elliot was one of the few friends Bruce ever had as a child. What Bruce didn't know however, was that Tommy Elliot suffered severe pathological tendencies. One evening Tommy Elliot arranged for his parents to die in an automobile accident. Upon hearing the news, Thomas Wayne rushed to Sacred Heart hospital. He was unable to save the life of Roger Elliot, but he did succeed in saving Marla Elliot, though her injuries would require extensive reconstructive surgery. A few weeks later, Thomas, Martha and young Bruce were walking home from a night out at the movies.  A mugger leapt from the shadows of Park Row and assaulted them, demanding money. Thomas tried to fight back, but the mugger shot him directly in the chest, killing him. He then turned his gun on Martha and viciously ended her life as well. Bruce Wayne stared on in horror, as his parents lay dead beside him. Chill turned and ran from the alleyway. Bruce made a graveside promise that he would bring the lowly killer to justice and avenge their deaths. A few years ago, the international eco-terrorist Ra's al Ghul disinterred the Waynes' remains and threatened to immerse them in one of his Lazarus Pits – a side effect of which would be resurrection as a decomposed zombie. Batman infiltrated Ra's stronghold however, and reclaimed his parents' bodies before Ra's could fulfill his scheme. Not long after, Bruce Wayne discovered evidence that Thomas may have been unfaithful to Martha and sired an illegitimate child with a woman from Santa Prisca - a child who eventually grew up to become the crime-lord known as Bane. However, it has since been clarified that Bane bears no familial relation to Bruce Wayne. Bruce Wayne never discovered the true identity of Thomas Wayne's murderer, although recent evidence suggests that the super-villain known as Metallo may have been involved with the crime, if not directly responsible for the murders of Thomas and Martha Wayne *  Business Management *  Medical Science *  Medical Science *  As a child, Thomas was a member of the Green Lantern fan club and his son Bruce (who occasionally works with his father's hero) keeps a autographed picture of ten-year-old Thomas and the Lantern. *  The character of Thomas Wayne was created by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane.

LegendsOfTomorrow,35z5wy,BallisticGE0RGE,6,Fri May 15 15:40:22 2015 UTC,I have a feeling they'll address this in the first half of Arrow season 4. It seems as if by the time this trailer (and the pilot) occur everyone is used to her being alive.
LegendsOfTomorrow,35z5wy,vrd93,2,Thu May 14 23:51:10 2015 UTC,Or they'll do it in flashbacks.
LegendsOfTomorrow,35z5wy,rush247,3,Thu May 14 23:54:27 2015 UTC,".we know it's nobody from Team Flash or Arrow cause I'm pretty sure they would've said something about it by now.   Malcom's manipulative enough that it wouldn't be farfetched that he revived her immediately after killing her, and let everyone else believe she had truly died to set his plan in motion."

EDIT:  An exact timeline is never given but generally the longer you're dead the less likely you'll be brought back whole.  Also if you've sustained too much damage it won't work well either.  Also the side effects of insanity and super strength are only temporary however repeated use can have a more prolonged effect, which explains Thea.  spoiler  source"

LegendsOfTomorrow,35yqp5,velkro16,4,Fri May 15 07:34:51 2015 UTC,"Depends on the Pit rules in the Arrowverse. In the comics, I think that after one year, there would be a risk of her coming back as a zombie.

LegendsOfTomorrow,35yqp5,Gemini95,1 point,Fri May 15 09:01:17 2015 UTC,"Right. It just wouldn't make sense if they kept using the pit like they did with Thea. I accept that the pit within itself is a plot device but for goodness sakes, just bring her back from the dead. It's not like I can't believe it. There is going to be time traveling and reincarnation in LoT, I can totally believe that some mystic water can ressurect a character."

LegendsOfTomorrow,35yqp5,razrsharp007,7,Thu May 14 17:46:45 2015 UTC,It's a midseason thing I believe.

LegendsOfTomorrow,35yqp5,The_LDT,-22,Thu May 14 18:36:11 2015 UTC,Utterly irrelevant when the writers who created those characters haven't been active writers in so long.  I think he's pointing it out because Ray Palmer was just tv-budget Iron Man until after the Ant-Man trailers came out. Now he's copying a new MCU character.
LegendsOfTomorrow,35yqp5,BooksAgain,16,Thu May 14 19:12:10 2015 UTC,"How is he copying him if the atom comic character came out before the antman one? Are you just pointing out the circle-jerk or are you participating in it, I can't understand :D"

LegendsOfTomorrow,35yqp5,hardgeeklife,3,Fri May 15 02:25:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah clearly Oliver knows Sara is alive. He's probably the one to bring her back in the Lazarus pit. But Sara's death was really the spark that set off all the drama between Laurel and her dad, Nissa and her dad, Thea and her dad, and Oliver and the League of Assassins. If Oliver just told everyone Sara was alive again, then a huge chunk of Season 3 of Arrow was pretty pointless."
LegendsOfTomorrow,35yqp5,iwishiwasamoose,7,Thu May 14 18:49:18 2015 UTC,Sara dying was the entire plot of season 3....
LegendsOfTomorrow,35yqp5,itzjamez1215,3,Thu May 14 20:35:54 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, yeah. I really liked Sara and was sad to see her die, but bringing her back seems like a questionable choice since it destroys the whole motivation of the third season of Arrow, even if she only appears on the new show. I mean, what else was there in season three? A few Flash crossovers, the introduction of ATOM, Diggle's marriage and kid, Thea learning martial arts, and the Oliver/Felicity romance. All that could have happened without Sara's death. Everything else was caused by that one death. Bringing her back feels like the equivalent of a character waking up and realizing the past season was all a bad dream. Might as well bring back Oliver's dad and have him say the message about saving the city was the start of a novel he was working on in his spare time, not an actual suggestion. Which is why I feel like they may keep Sara's resurrection a complete secret from most of the Arrow characters and simply chose to never mention her again. Except, dang, the trailer for Legends says that the heroes will literally be legends, as in famous, so you gotta figure the Lance family will eventually notice Sara is alive, right?"
LegendsOfTomorrow,35yqp5,iwishiwasamoose,4,Thu May 14 20:58:24 2015 UTC,Yea it'll be hard to not mention Sara to Laurel especially since she's doing her whole Black Canary thing to honor Sara. But if they don't talk about it Laurel and Lance would find out later on and that would cause even more drama
LegendsOfTomorrow,35yqp5,itzjamez1215,6,Thu May 14 21:01:53 2015 UTC,You better believe Lance will blame Oliver for that
LegendsOfTomorrow,35yqp5,bliffay,2,Thu May 14 22:08:05 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd love for a 'Jason Todd' angle for her from using the Pit. That would be interesting, especially since you can get a vibe she isn't perfectly alright during this trailer."
LegendsOfTomorrow,35yqp5,BewareTheBatsie,3,Thu May 14 19:29:00 2015 UTC,This would be the best option in my opinion. Everyone's quick to compare this White Canary to the one in the comics. For all we know (we can see that she's kind of off) she can be the whole anti-hero deal like Jason Todd. Only loosely based off her comic counterpart.    This is like the 10th time I've said this.. I think I have a problem.
LegendsOfTomorrow,35yqp5,Mr_Milenko,2,Thu May 14 20:32:14 2015 UTC,I hope the first half of season 4 of arrow involves Sara and the repercussions of her coming back via Lazarus pit
LegendsOfTomorrow,35yqp5,rnarkus,2,Thu May 14 19:58:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they need to touch on this somehow on one of the shows. I'm also curious if they will ever show how it impactedSpoiler"

LegendsOfTomorrow,35yqp5,Blanchimont,2,Thu May 14 21:52:06 2015 UTC,As much as I love the whole time travel and different timelines and what not. I really want the reveal and origin of legends of tomorrow to be in the same timeline as flash and the arrow.

LegendsOfTomorrow,35yqp5,Hellotoyouplease,3,Thu May 14 17:50:09 2015 UTC,grate to see Lotz back but the pit can't bring people back from a rotten corpse i was hoping she would be an alternate version of her. If that was the cast Malcome could just bring Tommy back and Oliver could just ask Malcome to bring back mom and dad. not going on a rant just being a big geek about it.
LegendsOfTomorrow,35yqp5,jasazick,5,Thu May 14 19:52:59 2015 UTC,"Both the pit and time travel can be used as REALLY annoying plot do-over devices. I'd love to see them get rid of the pit at some point down the road, maybe destroying it or moving it to a new (hidden) location. Having an instant bring-back-from-the-dead device is almost too powerful for most TV writers. They just can't help themselves, especially if they need to goose the ratings."

In this universe, Oliver Queen never surrendered his role as al Sah-Him, and rose through the ranks until he eventually became the new heir to the demon... the new Ra's al-Ghul. And after detonating the Alpha-Omega bomb in Starling City, he rules the city's shattered remains with an iron fist. After a drunk driver left him crippled at a young age, Hunter Zolomon became determined to regain the use of his legs. His drive eventually lead him into the scientific field, and into the arms of S.T.A.R. Labs, where he worked with various electrochemical concoctions trying to restore the use of his legs. One day, after an electrical surge, his concoctions blew up in his face and gave him incredible superspeed. Overjoyed at his powers, he created a yellow-and-red costume and used his speed to help people. But after accidentally running forward into time, he was horrified to learn that his destiny was to become a supervillain working for a shadowy crime overlord. Though horrified at his apparent corruption, he quickly assumed his role as a villain to avoid damaging the timestream. He is now known as Inertia. Raymond Palmer was a ruthless industrialist who wanted the world in his pocket. So when super-powered criminals began showing up, he grew envious of their abilities and wanted powers of his own. So he spent his company's entire fortune on tampering with the dimensional properties of a mysterious dwarf star alloy he recovered. After billions of dollars and years of research, he had finally built a suit for himself out of this alloy, and added military-grade technology. He is now known as Dwarf Star, and commits subatomic crimes to rebuild his fortunes. As the years went by, more and more of these villains showed up, slowly gaining control over the entire world. None of the world's governments were doing anything, so Leonard Snart did what he had to do- stole an experimental cryonic cyclotron from the mad genius Dr. Stein, crafted it into a gun, and took up the mantle of Citizen Cold. Even with his so-called Advection Array, he is incapable of truly saving his world.   I can do more if anyone wants to hear them"

But the xenophobic Rip didn't trust these aliens. He spread his isolationist point of view across the world, amassing a world army to repel these aliens and send them to death camps- and in the process, became the most evil man since Adoplh Hitler. One day, he was attacked by a version of Green Arrow from the year 85,201 AD. He managed to overpower this futuristic assassin, and reverse-engineered the time machine that brought him to the ""past"". Rip vowed to reshape the world in his image, starting at the 21st Century. It was because of him that Green Arrow was corrupted, which caused a ripple effect that lead to this dystopian future. He is now called God-Emporer Chronos."

They now serve as Ra's al-Ghul's personal bodyguards and assassins. Sheyara Hol was a Thanagarian scout, sent to determine whether Earth would be a worthwhile conquest. While she was on Earth, she learned that her home world had been destroyed by the Thanagarians' longtime rivals: the Rannians. Now the sole survivor of a dead planet, she uses modified medieval weaponry to brutalize earthlings as the Hawkwoman.  Doctor Martin Stein had been fired from S.T.A.R.

Chronos was intrigued by the experiments he wanted to conduct on metahumans, and Stein was made into his resident mad scientist.

LegendsOfTomorrow,35ywk8,CCCrank,1 point,Sat May 16 11:48:32 2015 UTC,That is correct. What is she like in the comics? I have only seen talk about her in Smallville where she is dead. And Hawkman just didnt make any sense to me as a superhero.
LegendsOfTomorrow,35ywk8,Tomhap,2,Sat May 16 11:54:56 2015 UTC,"Alright, i'm gonna keep it short. In the comics she's actually an alien, thanagarian to be exact, in the show i don't think she is an alien. She carries a mace. If you wanna see her in action i think you should watch Justice League/Justice League: Unlimited, thats where i became familiar with the character. She's an interesting character. It needs to fit into the world to make sense, i haven't watched smallville so i cannot comment on that. But in JL/JLU she fit's in.   Hope i answered some of your questions at least, also i suck at formating so i hope it's readable atleast :D  EDIT: There is a lot of information online, maybe you could do some reasearch, wikia's and things are full of information on characters."
LegendsOfTomorrow,362qjf,instaaddy,11,Fri May 15 16:33:22 2015 UTC,Malcolm in exchange for Nyssa not murdering him in his sleep.
LegendsOfTomorrow,362qjf,Octogenarian,3,Fri May 15 16:41:23 2015 UTC,Malcolm is usually one step ahead of people like nyssa
LegendsOfTomorrow,362qjf,stormesp,3,Fri May 15 17:01:32 2015 UTC,It was obviusly Malcolm because arrow/nyssa (or both ) demanded it. Maybe Nyssa betraying Malcom in his new home
LegendsOfTomorrow,362qjf,QewBacca,2,Fri May 15 16:56:43 2015 UTC,Nyssa reviving her is possible....... But cant help but think if nyssa feels about use of the lazarus pit the same as malcolm....... It changes peoples souls......choose death over it
LegendsOfTomorrow,362qjf,random_87,2,Fri May 15 17:04:37 2015 UTC,"I think it's similar to that. Malcolm probably wants to right his wrongs ( since he basically killed Sara) and since he's the new Ras it would help if Nyssa helped him, also it was teased as Oliver at the end of arrow said he will not forgive Malcolm for killing Sara. Also about the brainwashing, Sara has been dead for so long that she will get slot of her character wiped anyway when she's resurrected I think they will play on the ""new Sara""."
LegendsOfTomorrow,362qjf,Phee78,3,Sat May 16 12:51:02 2015 UTC,"I think it might be Damien Darkh, the next big villain. He has his own Lazarus pit. By resurrecting Sara, he might brainwash her or even otherwise she will go after Thea which would mean Team Arrow and  Malcom who is responsible for her death.   She might be an important tool for damien in Season 4a before she recovers and moves to the spin off."
LegendsOfTomorrow,362qjf,ArtificiallySocial,3,Fri May 15 17:29:07 2015 UTC,"Saw someone post that on tumblr earlier, and I was in the middle of thinking it's probably highly unlikely when it occurred to me that he's just been in Starling for some reason we don't yet know, so maybe he was grave robbing?  The setup of the Pit in the trailer clip does look very much like the Nanda Parbat Pit, but FWIW they seem to have lit it differently, it looks dark and cold, instead of those warm hues they favour for Nanda Parbat.  That could be reading too much into things, or it could be an indication that it's a similar Pit, but in a different location, belonging to a different person.  Perhaps?"
LegendsOfTomorrow,362qjf,FreeWestPapua,6,Fri May 15 17:54:08 2015 UTC,You could almost say it looks... Darhker.

LegendsOfTomorrow,364acg,cheddarsalad,2,Sat May 16 03:44:54 2015 UTC,And Sara has the skills without any special equipment! You'd think Ray would build something to suit her.  Some fancy magical lightweight armor at the least so a stray bullet won't kill her.
LegendsOfTomorrow,364acg,BellatorInMachina,2,Sat May 16 04:04:47 2015 UTC,again
LegendsOfTomorrow,364acg,cheddarsalad,1 point,Sat May 16 06:29:50 2015 UTC,I think it's more likely that Ray was controlling the suit remotely.  I doubt she knew anything about operating it heck she couldn't even get it off.
LegendsOfTomorrow,364acg,rush247,2,Sat May 16 04:29:05 2015 UTC,"yeah, but the whole point of her wearing it was because Ray was too busy with something else. also, Ray was shown to have trouble removing the suit himself."
LegendsOfTomorrow,364acg,cheddarsalad,4,Sat May 16 06:31:52 2015 UTC,"yes, fuck Robbie for making a career decision, you're obviously more attune to the situation than he or his agents are."

LegendsOfTomorrow,364acg,jasazick,1 point,Sat May 16 01:01:42 2015 UTC,"I think Snart would be pretty useful as a smart, tactical guy.

As for Captain Cold and Heatwave: So? Without the Suit Ray is just a normal guy and Stein needs some one to merge with in order for his powers to work (as far as we know) Thirdly, it looks like Ronnie and Caitlin are going to be married by the end of this season of the Flash, so he probably won't want to run off and leave his wife behind after being apart for so long"

LegendsOfTomorrow,35yk7p,saltymuffaca,4,Thu May 14 16:42:40 2015 UTC,Yah it does but according to the tweets of those who are in the CW upfronts vandal savage has been confirmed as the big bad
LegendsOfTomorrow,35yk7p,mrglass8,3,Thu May 14 16:54:51 2015 UTC,Trailer confirms it.

LegendsOfTomorrow,35yk7p,mrglass8,2,Fri May 15 11:00:20 2015 UTC,He was relatively the same.
LegendsOfTomorrow,35yk7p,ltran96,3,Thu May 14 18:34:46 2015 UTC,Not really. In JL he was far more angry  and egotistic.

I’m really looking forward to it. The stuff they were telling me about it and where they’re going to go with the character is exciting""... what if Merlyn somehow made a deal with Nyssa in which, in exchange for her stepping temporarily down for Ra's position she gets Sara resurrected by the pit?  It would also explain her stronger side-effects in regard of those of Thea, since she's been dead for months. Though I'm not sure Nyssa would value Sara's resurrection more than a role she's been wanting all her life and for which she was ready to die."

LegendsOfTomorrow,35xy7h,Rover16,3,Thu May 14 15:09:32 2015 UTC,Let the theories begin!
LegendsOfTomorrow,35xy7h,Doctor_Arkham,2,Thu May 14 15:11:14 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping this series explores the ""crises"" from the comics. This means they could opt to have multiple forms of any characters including Black Canary. Cold and Heatwave can be good guys. The Palmer and Stein of the Flarrow universe could be working together to uncover localized spacetimes where one or more worlds are bleeding into each other briefly. This means any character from any other alternate reality could just walk down a street and find him/herself walk into another reality which is nearly identical to the one they left, or dramatically different. Whatever suits the necessities of the plot and capabilities of the special effects budget.   We could get multiple Flashes, Arrows, anyone from the DC universe.   A butler named Alfred who took up crime fighting after his dead employers the Waynes left their entire fortune to him in their will. They died in an alley to a thug, and to honor their memory he cleans up the streets they loved. I doubt he woulda chose to be a man in a bat costume, but you get the idea.   Yall are asking who Caity Lotz is gonna be. How many Saras can she be? Does she even need to be Sara? Does she even need to be Black Canary? Maybe sometimes she's The Huntress. Or Power Girl. Maybe sometimes she's The Arrow. Maybe sometimes she's just a party girl from Starling City."
LegendsOfTomorrow,35xy7h,ZachsMind,2,Thu May 14 17:18:32 2015 UTC,Oh geez. She could pull a Gwen Stacy.

LegendsOfTomorrow,35zstd,Thefriendlypsycho,2,Thu May 14 22:22:23 2015 UTC,"Since they are keeping film and tv in separate universes, they COULD use Darkseid, but I think he might be a little much for that team to handle. Plus, he would be a tough one to pull off on TV budgets."

In fact every time they get asked about Diggle possibly taking up that role they get very coy - so I think something might be planned at some point. I personally like the theory that Diggle's middle name happens to be Stewart. He would be great for that role, and it would still allow for Hal Jordan to exist."
LegendsOfTomorrow,3604bi,jasazick,1 point,Fri May 15 02:13:51 2015 UTC,"It does work very well. Since the Justice League / Justice League Unlimited version was so popular, they retro-fitted the military background the cartoon gave him in the comics (he was originally an architect). It does match very well with Diggle's character.   It seems so obvious so I would be blown away if they make him a different hero, but it seems to fit so well that it would be awesome.

LegendsOfTomorrow,35yxo2,Todrick,3,Thu May 14 18:21:09 2015 UTC,Pure speculation here but maybe Vandal Savage does something that REALLY pisses off Snart - enough that he willingly joins forces with the other team members for the long haul. Vandal or Vandal's organization killing his sister would certainly do that.
LegendsOfTomorrow,35yxo2,jasazick,2,Thu May 14 20:49:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe Hunter just convinces Snart he'd be much happier (and more famous) playing the hero for a while. If Barry could talk him down, how difficult could it be for a Linear Man."
LegendsOfTomorrow,35yxo2,LockeNCole,2,Thu May 14 21:50:52 2015 UTC,Well the CW White Canary may have no relation to the comic version.

LegendsOfTomorrow,35yxo2,Todrick,1 point,Thu May 14 22:22:37 2015 UTC,"She didn't need to become a villain to be completely rewritten. Besides, she was anti-hero in the comics. It'd be like J. Jonah Jameson becoming a die-hard Spidey supporter. A complete change in the character."
LegendsOfTomorrow,35yxo2,LockeNCole,2,Thu May 14 22:31:22 2015 UTC,"White Canary in the comics is a villain, but this Canary has no relation to that. Captain Cold is a villain that sort of teeters on the edge of being a hero at times. He doesn't kill and tries not to hurt people, and at various times in the comics has acted as a ""good guy"". Heatwave in the CWverse just sorta does whatever Cold tells him to so."

Which means all the drama between Laurel and her dad, Nissa and her dad, and Thea and her dad (they sure like father-daughter drama on Arrow) was for nothing. Heck, most of Season 3 of Arrow should have been unnecessary if Oliver just told everyone that Sara came back to life."

But then Nyssa tells everyone or just Oliver? Because we definitely see Oliver and Sara together in the trailer. Also, wouldn't Nyssa and Sara get back together if Nyssa was the one to resurrect her? They seemed somewhat back together before Sara died. How would the writers separate them? Nyssa agrees to stay as part of the deal for bringing her back?"
LegendsOfTomorrow,35yf3h,jasazick,2,Thu May 14 20:35:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe there is a correlation between the time difference between death and Lazarus pit regeneration and mental stability issues - she might want to go off and do her own thing, and then somehow gets pulled into the Vandal Savage conflict."

The shows about a group of people of different age, ability and status (hero, vigilante, villain) to stop a threat from the future which puts them all at risk.

A Villain.  --- EDIT ---  No Longer Speculation: She IS White Canary  --- End Edit ---  As for Ronnie and Stein separating... That's a thing in the comics too... Ronnie forms the Firestorm Matrix again with Jason Rusch(who has already been introduced on Flash)  This seems like the obvious answer as we've already seem Firestorm separated from Stein in the Super Hero Fight Club video and images. I don't believe that was an accident or over sight. This would allow Stein to be the wise guiding force of the team.

Man, I was so happy to see Firestorm in The Flash, as he was always one of my favourites, but the announcement of Prof Stein in Legends and no news on Ronnie really bothers me - as does the potential shunting of Ronnie out to bring in Jason as the other component of Firestorm.  The character is so new to a lot of people, especially a TV audience, and making him loose and flimsy in such a way is so demeaning!"
LegendsOfTomorrow,35qe2z,DanArlington,3,Wed May 13 17:04:13 2015 UTC,"Ronnie wouldn't get shunted, Prof. Stein goes to Legends while Ronnie fuses with Jason Rusch (who was already introduced in an earlier episode)"

LegendsOfTomorrow,35qe2z,Dredd_Pirate_Barry,3,Thu May 14 16:48:43 2015 UTC,"Ronnie is very smart in The Flash. He was the engineer for the Particle Accelerator, so he isn't dumb what so ever. But it is true that in the comics he is just a gym teacher I think. That is what he was in Batman: TBATB. I think that putting Jason in would make very little sense since they aren't that close with either Stein or Ronnie. Also in the trailer if Stein isn't in the Matrix why would F.I.R.E.S.T.O.R.M. even be there. The only possibilities are: Ronnie & Stein: DURING LOT Ronnie: BEFORE LOT Ronnie and Jason: AFTER LOT It would be jumping in and out. I agree that it is inconvenient, but it would be fun to see that."

LegendsOfTomorrow,35qe2z,yuloforce,5,Tue May 12 19:35:22 2015 UTC,"He won't die, he'll either be Firestorm alone or alongside Jason Rusch allowing Martin Stein to leave for Legends as an independent scientist. Aside from Ronnie Raymond being big in the comics, (which means if he ever does die, it'll be a comic book death, meaning he'll come back later on) they've also teased pursuing Caitlin's Killer Frost alter-ego and Ronnie plays a huge part of that so they can't just kill him off."

LegendsOfTomorrow,35ikkd,TheCrimsonCritic,6,Sun May 10 18:52:36 2015 UTC,"Okay, so to begin I actually like what you said here. It seems pretty well thought out and seems to keep in line with the way the CW seems to be interpreting the DC universe. I especially like the idea about how to incorporate the Monitor; it really fits in with the CWverse, imo. I don't know if this would be accurate, but I don't think I'd mind if it were, to be honest.  However, a few things I thought while reading it:    I completely agree about Rip being the main character. I don't think they're going to go the reincarnated goddess route with Hawkgirl in the show. I know in the New 52 Earth-2 comics, Hawkgirl was affiliated with an ARGUS-like organization and my money is that she'll be based more on that version of the character instead. The casting seems to back that up, imo.  Edit: Apparently they are, hahaha I really hope Jay Jackson is more or less Static. I'm doubtful that they'll introduce Cyborg, as the CW shows seem to dislike sharing characters and Cyborg is totally in the Snyder-verse. I think he's gonna be in Batman v. Superman, actually. So, instead of Cyborg, I'm thinking he may be someone like Static. Though really, anybody is fair game at this point.  I like your version Savage, with that rare condition or whatever. It seems to fall in line with how Arrow would do him. I really do like the ""caveman takes a nap by a meteor"" version of the character, but your version is pretty neato."
LegendsOfTomorrow,35ikkd,cantletyoubrewthat,3,Sun May 10 20:26:17 2015 UTC,As far as your point on Hawkgirl...   http://deadline.com/2015/03/arrow-flash-spinoff-hawkgirl-ciara-renee-cw-1201401280/  I'm sure they'll do it justice though.
LegendsOfTomorrow,35ikkd,kyleisfat,2,Sun May 10 23:19:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, wow. I hadn't read that. Thanks for the info!"
LegendsOfTomorrow,35ikkd,cantletyoubrewthat,1 point,Mon May 11 00:48:58 2015 UTC,"First of all thank you so much for the feedback. It really does mean a lot. The thing about Hawkgirl is that she is a very unique character and a tricky one to adapt to the more grounded CWverse. I decided to go with the godlike backstory because it is the only one that is somewhere in the way of suspension of disbelief because we don't actually see it happen. Also it takes up less screen time, which is optimal when juggling a cast as large as the one CW has selected.  As for Jay Jackson, I'd like him to be Cyborg because it fits the plot I have developed, but I can absolutely see them going the other way with Static. But I don't think the film universe will affect that decision at all. The CW still seem happy to use the Suicide Squad, and The Flash is thriving, despite being set to be on the big screen.  But thanks for all of the feedback. And as for the Savage idea, I have to be honest that I just wrote it on the spot because I had forgotten to give him any sort of a motive while I was hypothesising on my phone before writing this little essay!"
LegendsOfTomorrow,35ikkd,cantletyoubrewthat,1 point,Sun May 10 21:44:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Savage was really well done imo.   In terms of the WB movies vs. the CW shows, I've seen it said a lot on the Arrow and Flash TV subs about them killing/writing off characters that are going to be in the movies (I won't say specifically who, for spoliery reasons). There are many inconsistencies with that claim (like Flash, obviously) but I can see where it's coming from. While Cyborg might not be ""off-limits"" per se, I do kind of hope they don't go that route, if only just because we're gonna see Cyborg on the big screen and I also kind of want to see him in the Titans show.   Although, Static might fit in with your plot, outside of being cybernetic. Virgil is super intelligent (he's got an internship at some big technology company and designed Kid Flash's suit in the New 52 IIRC) and he could gain his powers from the same incident you described above. Just replace super strong with electricity? It's not a perfect swap, but I can see it working with some tweaking.   That being said, I do really like what you did with Cyborg regardless. Again, it's a pretty grounded take and it fits really well with how CW would handle the character, especially on something like The Flash.   One thing I forgot to add, I really like the idea of the characters all having separate storylines at first and not meeting up for several episodes. It reminded me of the Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heros cartoon, where they weren't technically the Avengers for like, five episodes or something (which is a good thing, hahaha)."
LegendsOfTomorrow,35ikkd,cantletyoubrewthat,1 point,Sun May 10 22:00:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I thought it was pretty important to separate them. My main fear with the Justice League movie is that I don't think we are gonna see enough of them individually before the big one. Setting up Rip, Kendra and Jay beforehand is essential because they haven't been established beforehand."
LegendsOfTomorrow,35ikkd,Nebula153,1 point,Sun May 10 22:02:28 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. And, funny enough, I've got the same fear about the JLA movie. One of the reasons I think The Avengers worked so well is because we met the characters beforehand but JLA is gonna have to set up half the team, isn't it?  Anyway, good idea and overall, good work on your synopsis, man."

LegendsOfTomorrow,35ikkd,cantletyoubrewthat,1 point,Sun May 10 22:20:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think Cyborg is too unlikely, when you consider that they had Cyborg in Smallville. Although that version was pretty bad it just makes it more possible.  Also since his name is Jay Jackson, it could be a new version of Cyborg entirely to avoid the character being ripped from the series."
LegendsOfTomorrow,35ikkd,AWorldW-OShrimp,1 point,Mon May 11 06:51:39 2015 UTC,He could also be the other hae of Firestorm in this series or even Black Lightning
LegendsOfTomorrow,35ikkd,Freshenstein,2,Mon May 11 23:21:02 2015 UTC,I didn't even consider him being half of Firestorm. That would be interesting.
LegendsOfTomorrow,35ikkd,DanArlington,3,Tue May 12 12:11:16 2015 UTC,"Excellent theory! Given that we know some shooting for a set-up (presumably following the Flash finale) has already been done, though, I'm not sure if they'll take 3 or 4 episodes to set up the whole team. I would not at all be surprised if Hawkgirl has her powers at the start of the show."
LegendsOfTomorrow,35ikkd,DanArlington,2,Mon May 11 15:13:37 2015 UTC,This sounds amazing.
LegendsOfTomorrow,35ikkd,cantletyoubrewthat,2,Sun May 10 20:36:14 2015 UTC,"I am overwhelmed by the effort you've gone to in putting that all together? Firstly, what gave you the inspiration for this story? Don't tell me you're a CW writer? I know there are a fair few lurking here... The show has a fairly unique set of characters put together in comparison to what sort of teams exist in the comics, so I am curious to see how they'd work if they're all going to be doing so in tandem.   As an aside, I like the story. I like the use of time travel, but am wary that it might be over done, and since The Flash is so heavily time-line oriented at the moment, I don't imagine that this show would go down the same route.   Also, I just don't want to imagine the Monitor and Anti-Monitor being used in this way. To be man-made? Its all too Ultron for me. I think that the true comic book characters that they are, are just too out-there a concept to be brought into the CWverse. Sure, you could try making them more relevant and realistic, which was what you did, but it took everything away from them that made them ""monitors"". I mean, imagining what you've described being the focal point of A Crisis on Infinite Earths? I can't!  *EDIT: I do realise that Rip is a time traveller, and sure, I get that means time travel will probably have to happen in Legends, I just can't imagine there would be much of it happening in the show. More a thing that is discussed rather than acted upon. The whole CWverse seems to be more grounded than that at the moment."
LegendsOfTomorrow,35ikkd,cantletyoubrewthat,3,Sun May 10 21:16:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the feedback. I actually wrote this after reading the announcement article. I opened notes on my phone, typed 'Episode 1', and was done in 40 minutes. My biggest issue when speculating was the Anti-Monitor. I visualise him here as a 'pre-Ultron' if you will. Ultron before he got his proper body after escaping the Avengers Tower.   I only really used him because Rip's story comes directly from the aftermath of A Crisis on Infinite Earths, as him meeting himself in another timeline is what actually happened. I would use a different villain, but was struggling to think of one that works in the same context. I considered AMAZO, but they have already used them in the context of a boat, and I don't find him to be a particularly 'multiverse-level' threat. Adapting Anti-Monitor for a television audience was the best fit for the story I wanted to see happen, if only because I can imagine how much we would all be squealing at that reveal at the end of episode 7 if this was really what happened."
LegendsOfTomorrow,35ikkd,DanArlington,2,Sun May 10 21:40:13 2015 UTC,"I see. Well, you've thought about it a lot and I can't fault you on that.   I just really don't like the adapted version of the monitor being something cooked up and can travel on a USB stick. I wasn't quite born for Crisis on Infinite Earths, but I read a copy when I was a child, and was introduced to the Monitor and Anti-Monitor (and their subsequent reimaginations over the years) as beings of ridiculous levels of intelligence and oversight. I just feel like its a massive kick in the pants for them. No justice in that. It'd be like having a Superman where he was actually just a boy from Smallville who's greatest power was that he was slightly stronger than you're average man.   I would love for Anti-Monitor to feature, but in a TV universe without the DC big guns, I don't want it to. Wouldn't work for me."
LegendsOfTomorrow,35ikkd,cantletyoubrewthat,2,Sun May 10 22:14:34 2015 UTC,"I understand. Of course the Monitor is alive, and I could totally see myself writing a second season when I have another rainy afternoon. This is essentially an origin story for the Monitor and Savage as much as it is for the Legends, and no one is at their most powerful in the origin story."
LegendsOfTomorrow,35ikkd,cantletyoubrewthat,2,Sun May 10 22:20:34 2015 UTC,"I liked his idea for the Monitor, but I can actually completely get where you're coming from. Now that I think about it, the Monitor and Anti-Monitor are super iconic and it would be kind of weird/anticlimactic to see them utilized in the way OP described.  What if instead of the Monitor, it essentially was changed to something like Amazo? I don't mean literally; I know Amazo and Ivo were in Arrow. But something like that or maybe even something that could lead into Red Tornado?  Not saying that I think this is where they're going; just kind of speculating based on OP's idea."
LegendsOfTomorrow,35ikkd,mrP0P0,2,Sun May 10 21:21:28 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I was just stuck for a cybernetic villain that would still allow for there to be another visible threat before he appears towards the end, and the Anti-Monitor seemed the best fit, especially considering what I was planning with Rip Hunter. I wrote above the struggles of coming up with a villain, and it is certainly the most interchangeable part of my season arc, but I couldn't for the life of me think of a good alternative. Of course if this is what ends up happening, at least in my head I can imagine the Monitor's armour being awesome and extremely powerful, considering it has to go head to head with the entire Legends roster in episode eight."
LegendsOfTomorrow,35ikkd,AgentChris101,1 point,Sun May 10 21:47:25 2015 UTC,"I can see that. The Monitor/Anti-Monitor does seem to fit nicely with the ""threat to time itself"" aspect.   Regardless of what happens, it needs to be worthy of the League's full strength. Good job, OP."
LegendsOfTomorrow,35ikkd,CuriousCursor,1 point,Sun May 10 21:53:54 2015 UTC,"Amazo   Interesting. The tagline when the show was picked up specified that it was some kind of ""unstoppabale"" and ""immortal threat"". I guess that's where the concept for the Anti-Monitor comes from in context. However, I don't feel like the version described above fits the bill either.   As trite as it may be to pick Darkseid, he would fit well, wouldn't he? But, maybe more of the style of story like from the Justice League: War DCAU movie?  EDIT: I'm talking nonsense. Savage is obviously the main bad guy here, but the concept of tying him in with the monitors doesn't fit for me."
