guitarlessons,3e0s7h,i_need_a_pee,4,Tue Jul 21 13:50:12 2015 UTC,"Well I'm a little biased since I'm the sole creator of both the blog and application (http://keeping-tabs.io) but I'll try to give you a rundown of why I created the site, and where I see it going.  As a guitar player myself, I was noticing that I wasn't great at getting into a habit. I've been playing for about 10 years now but have been one of those 'on and off' focus type players where some days I'll practice for a few hours and then other times I'll have dry spells where I don't even pick it up for a week or two. I had noticed that there were some great resources for setting up a plan but I'm the type of person that likes to see improvement, track progress, and follow a strict schedule and there was no place on the internet that allowed me to do that. So, being the software developer I am, I went ahead and created it.  The site is in its infant stages right now but it does give you an editor to create lessons, a place to manage lessons into lesson plans which can be scheduled out over days of the week, in-app notifications will let you know when you need to practice, when it is time to practice you'll be guided through the scheduled lessons one by one with an onscreen metronome and timer and when you are complete with a lesson plan you'll be able to log your duration and beats per minute for that session. This information then becomes available with some nice graphs in the statistics section so you can see your progress over time, and track how far you've come.   I've noticed that a lot of people don't want to spend the time to build out lessons which is why I've started creating different lessons and uploading them on my blog. This is something I'll continue to do every week and as I do that, I'll also upload them to the site so people can incorporate them in their own lesson plans easily.  Going forward, I plan on adding:   A practice routine generator. With this, people will be able to create and run through a practice routine just by providing a duration of how long they'd like to practice. The lessons covered will be selectable and will come from my custom content as well as lessons you have created. A place to share lessons with other people on the site and upload them into your plans A calendar to see lessons that have been run visually and what's coming up An easier way to generate tabs in lesson plans. I'm currently using a modified markdown engine which allows users to create lessons with some simple formatting and will be integrating some guitar related commands to make creating lessons with tabs and diagrams much easier A fretboard diagram creator More statistics to track different things.   Hopefully that provides a good rundown of what it is and where I'm headed. I'm definitely looking for user feedback though and would love to help anyone get setup and/or hear everyone's comments!"
guitarlessons,3e4dfo,superior1997,2,Tue Jul 21 21:30:00 2015 UTC,Fingerstyle guitar is an entirely legitimate way to go. Lindsay Buckingham and Mark Knophler are both fantastic examples of rock guitarists who pretty much use their fingers exclusively.  You may find it difficult to build up speed (i.e. tremolo picking). It more or less comes down to how you want to sound.

guitarlessons,3dxyuo,young_mcdonald,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:39:11 2015 UTC,"You can still pretend you're in standard tuning and continue to think of the note layout that way. So if you tune a half step down and play a song in Eb minor, just pretend it's E minor and your solfage is still in the right place.  Dropped tuning is a little trickier but should be doable if one has learned standard tuning and Drop D.  You'd be right when it comes to open tunings. You'd have to relearn the fretboard sort of. Eventually, you start to learn strings. So doesn't matter which string is tuned to A, you'll remember that the 7th fret is an E on A, as well as every other fret."

guitarlessons,3dxkmm,Fakezaga,2,Tue Jul 21 02:08:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it actually came about from a post on here last year. I got a new guitar, and right about the same time /u/bluesnoodler posted a song that I thought ""that's exactly the kind of music I want to play"".  My promise to myself getting the new guitar was to make a concious effort to get better - I've been playing half arsed for 20 years, never really taking it seriously. I asked for a tab for the song and no one could find one, so one thing lead to another and the site was born. A song a week means I'm forced to spend a few hours a day trying to play something I've never seen before.  It's been awesome as a leaning tool, 6 months ago I tried to do Taj's Fishing Blues and just couldn't play it for more than 10 seconds; a month or so ago I tried again and could go through the whole thing in a few hours.   Being forced to learn a new one every week really means I have to have the guitar in hand 2 or 3 hours a day, learning something new. If you do that, you don't really have a choice - you are going to see some improvement! Hope you get something out of it - and any requests, just ask and I'll give it a go."

guitarlessons,3dxrzx,AlterBridgeFan,3,Mon Jul 20 12:19:10 2015 UTC,I remember that I refused to use my pinky for the first 6-9 months after picking up the guitar because i thought it was too clumsy and useless. But after started going through more and more complex songs and eventually the major scale i started picking up exercises that were designed specifically for this issue.   Justin Sandercoe has some nice tutorials on finger stretch and coordination like this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Zm_ho26O2U or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDt_4ha9Xjs.  It's a great struggle at the beginning but practice this daily and in very short time you'll see how your pinky stretches in no time.
guitarlessons,3dxrzx,Aerzho,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:40:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I use my pinky when I can, but I think it is because I have never needed to do this kind of stretch before."
guitarlessons,3dxrzx,beef-o-lipso,2,Mon Jul 20 12:48:23 2015 UTC,Use a strap. Raise the neck of the guitar higher so you can straighten your fretting hand. Rotate your wrist so your hand is in one line with your forearm. Then you can reach.   And practice.
guitarlessons,3dxrzx,circleof5surecanjive,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:31:08 2015 UTC,"Pinky? Can just reach the A string. It won't get up to the E string.   Can you explain this more.

But it doesn't matter. Unless your hands are ""circus freak-show"" small then all you need is practice."

(haven't had my coffee yet)  So I now noticed that your pinky is index finger is 4 frets away and not 3 frets away.   This is going to be hard for anyone in the beginning (unless they are blessed with long hands/fingers).   For this, I have a totally different video. Mostly the first part is for you. For example, play the pentatonic shape at the F and you will notice how much more of a stretch you give your pinky. And make sure you keep your index finger down while you reach for the second note.  edit: added words"

guitarlessons,3dtlvs,Darthgayder,6,Sun Jul 19 15:18:53 2015 UTC,Knowing about chord harmonization helps a lot. Here is a comment I wrote the other day as a beginner intro. Just a starting point but something you should look into if you are interested.

guitarlessons,3dtlvs,Furiou5,4,Mon Jul 20 02:23:50 2015 UTC,"Dominant major seventh chords are often played before playing the tonic of the key. To put it simply, the tonic is A, the subdominant is D and the dominant is E. E7 is a natural progression to A. To further establish this, the subdominant chord (D) is played in the progression. Also the A is played at the start of most iterations of the tempo (is there a word for this?)."

guitarlessons,3dtlvs,RickenAxer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:40:20 2015 UTC,"When you get to know harmony, it can be really easy to figure stuff like that.   It is very common to go IV-I, or V-I or Vsus4-I or iv-I. VERY common.  This is not at all any kind of ""complex"" progression. Just a simple I-iii-IV-V, with alterations at how he goes back to the I, so he might substitute a iv for the V, or a V sus4. It's pretty basic, actually.   If you don't get the roman numerals, go learn that."
guitarlessons,3dtlvs,Akoustyk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:50:20 2015 UTC,"I knew what he was playing because my ear is trained to know what chord progression he is using (a part of music theory).  Now, I couldn't tell exactly what key but I could guess with his chord positioning and shapes. So I got out my guitar and played along. It took about 3 seconds to find the key.  I reckon the best way to figure out what someone is playing.. Get your guitar out. And play along with him. Make sure it's in tune. Use your ear and you'll figure it out by copying his positioning and chord shapes."
guitarlessons,3dtlvs,duglett,0,Sun Jul 19 20:46:44 2015 UTC,"A major has the following notes:  A B C# D E F# G# A  There's theory called diatonic chord theory where you use the 1-3-5 of each of these notes. Each note is also called a scale degree - eg A is the 1st scale degree of the A major scale, D is the 4th etc.  The 1-3-5 is called the triad and you build chords from it by using the 1st, 3rd and 5th of the scale. This is how all the chords in the world are build - the root, the third and the 5th, then you can add or subtract other notes to get different sounds (eg a 7th chord is the 1-3-5 + the flattened 7th).  So with A, the first note of the scale, you use A, C# and E - the 1-3-5 of the scale above which gives you an A major chord. What diatonic theory teaches is that you can do this with every note of the scale.  So if we go to the second note, or the II scale degree B, and apply the 1-3-5 starting from B, but still using the notes of the A major scale, we'll get B D and F#, which is a Bm chord. Do it starting with the III degree C# and you get C# E G#, a C#m chord.  The chords all harmonise because every chord - there's 7 of them if you do the 1-3-5 of each scale degree - only use notes of the A major scale.   It's pretty neat, and one of the first things to spend time getting your head around. It's a serious door opener.  Edit: and someone with a bruised ego downvotes this, Get over yourself, mate."
guitarlessons,3dtg1w,The_Axem_Ranger,3,Sun Jul 19 07:51:08 2015 UTC,Probably one of the best ways of understanding picking technique is to spend a little time on Troy Grady's youtube channel. There's a huge amount of reference material there..  https://www.youtube.com/user/troygrady/  Steve
guitarlessons,3dtg1w,steve0192,2,Sun Jul 19 10:36:41 2015 UTC,"""Outside"" and ""Inside"" picking is a larger subset. You are doing one or the other, or a combination, every time you pick more than one string.  Alternate picking, Travis picking, Economy picking, Sweep picking, etc.... These are picking styles.    For something like a 3NPS pattern over 2 strings next to each other I'm confused on what's alternate, economy, inside, outside, combinations?   So when you switched strings, you would be able to go inside or outside, it would really depend on factors like if you start the 1st note with an up or down stroke and what picking style you chose.  Here are lessons on every kind of flat picking style that I could find: http://eatsleepguitar.com/2015/06/29/guitar-bucket-list/  Its in alphabetical order so look for ""Flat picking"""
guitarlessons,3dtg1w,circleof5surecanjive,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:55:59 2015 UTC,"Usually it has only to do with a strict alternate picking, and a single string change. You've picked a few notes on the B string, and now you are picking a note on the high E string. Your picked your last note on the B string with an up-stroke. Obviously, your next pick motion is going to have to be a down-stroke, and your next note is on the high E string. In doing this, you are using inside picking to get from the B to the E string, because for both notes, you kind of started from the middle, and struck outwards. On the other hand, if your last note on the B string was a down-stroke, your first note on the E string is going to have to be an up-stroke, and this is called outside picking, because you are attacking each string not from the middle position between them, but from positions outside both of them.   Now, it might seem like outside picking is more wasteful, in that you move your pick a greater distance overall, it's not true. Both motions involve moving the pick about the same distance. It's just a matter of when you choose for the pick to make contact with the strings - while moving the pick outwards from the middle, or moving back to the middle. But for some players, one of these types of picking can be more uncomfortable than the other. (And it makes a difference whether you're moving from a lower string to a higher string, and vice versa.) Personally, I can't inside pick to save my life. At least not at high speeds. I craft all my high-speed licks to pretty much only use outside picking. It's not ideal, and any real shredder would tell you that you have to master both mechanics. But I guarantee you that you can get a lot of mileage out of only mastering one."

Graphs to track metrics (BPM, duration) of your progress on all the lessons you practice.   Going forward, I plan on adding things like:   The ability to set goals (i.e. I want to play this lesson at 150 BPM by some date) and showing those goals on the graphs Pre-made lessons that users can use in their own lesson plans An on-screen tab editor for embedding tabs into lessons with the markdown editor More graphs A calendar to see upcoming / previously completed lessons   I would love to hear what you think about it and whether or not it helps your case / what you think could be done better!"

No theory knowledge, and and artists tend to make music that sounds pretty much the same year after year. it gets old after a while."

So it really boils down to you and if the book inspires you or teaches you specifically in a way that you can understand.  In other words, its all about YOU. So I think it is hard for someone who is not you to recommend a particular book.  You don't even need a method book, if you really want to go from beginner to ""player"", there are thousands of youtube videos and websites dedicated to just that.  I bought ""The Guitar Handbook"" by Ralph Denyer a long time ago and I still think it is one of the best guitar books I ever experienced. But that is because I like my information laid out in charts as opposed to learning a bunch of songs. So it worked for me."

Take a look at the videos if you're interested in learning how to play Ocelot, Sample, or others as I get them up.  This is definitely geared more towards intermediate players. It assumes you know most of the basic chords, but might want to be able to see how Trey plays them in context, work on your timing, and have something to play along with while you practice. I get tired of having to look down at a TAB sheet, or put something on in the background while practicing, so having one spot where I can see, hear, and read all at once helps me, and maybe will help you too.    Feel free to give feedback!  A shout out to Emil's Tabs who I use quite often as a reference!

guitarlessons,3dgigt,fiftyfiftygod,2,Thu Jul 16 02:20:17 2015 UTC,Can you do pull-offs on open strings?  Like --0-h2-0-- for like 10 minutes?  Start there.  Work up to 2 different frets.  The thing that I had to learn was to position/anchor my hand/thumb to allow me to do it.
guitarlessons,3dgigt,MojoMonster,2,Thu Jul 16 02:51:13 2015 UTC,"e|--9h10h11h12---9h12p11p10p9----9h10p9h11p9h12p9h11p9h10p9----|  I would practice these types of exercises over and over again for, say, 10 minutes per session. Try them on different strings and different positions, slow at first but increasing tempo as you improve. Start at 60 bpm to focus on form/technique and work up to 100 or even 120 bpm. If you go too fast too soon, you might a) develop bad playing habits and b) hurt yourself.   EDIT: Actually, the best thing you can do is learn a song or riff you like that is comprised of hammer-ons and pull-offs. I learned the intro riffs to ""The Trooper"" by Iron Maiden, the breakdown riff from ""Raining Blood"" by Slayer, and a few riffs by At the Gates and In Flames. Why? I liked Metal when I first started out. There must be a song or songs you like that incorporates the technique you want to learn."

Not that you necessarily outgrow the techniques, but that, at a certain point, the meedley bits, dive bombs, and sweeps get a bit staid, and unless you stretch into other genres, there's a lot you miss in terms of tonality and musicality.   I didn't respond to that thread, btw. But PG kinda nailed what moved me away from a shred Atkins diet."

The basics are: major scale, chord theory and diatonic theory. You should learn these 3 things - will take an hour or two to learn the theory if you are half decent at maths - but will take a lot longer to apply it to your playing.  That will give you the basics to jam along to just about any style, and will give you enough to write your own stuff - then you focus on the specifics on the style you are playing - pentatonic/blues scale/modes; certain chord voicings; left and right hand techniques."

guitarlessons,3dbroa,gruntznclickz,3,Wed Jul 15 01:39:09 2015 UTC,"Why not include talking about the CAGED method? Both for playing chords and how their patterns also lend themselves to playing the same scale in 5 adjacent positions covering the neck?  Or the 7 positions method where each scale degree gets its own pattern instead of just 5?   Both these systems work well.   I think an even better exercise once these are mastered is to not come up with a preconceived pattern, but instead try to play the scales truly by ear by playing the scale with no shapes or patterns by being familiar with melodic intervals anywhere on the neck and on any string combination.   Tim miller has a good lesson on this. http://youtu.be/akSYMd7bW2A  This is very good for improvisation and builds a relationship between ear and hand where you can react faster and more fluidly while also not getting stuck in patterns   http://youtu.be/3j8dSGu0i6c  another related lesson"
guitarlessons,3dbroa,DaveAF,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:31:37 2015 UTC,"play the scales truly by ear by playing the scale with no shapes or patterns by being familiar with melodic intervals anywhere on the neck and on any string combination.   I was just going to say this.  If you know the intervals and can name each note along the fretboard then you can derive any shape you wish (this goes for both chords and scales).   Also I don't think it's a good idea to learn just the root of a given shape, especially with bigger 2 octave shapes.  This can a be problem because it leads people to think that they can imply the tonality of the root by merely playing anything within the shape.  They think ""C lydian"", and play around with a shape without regard to what intervals they're actually targeting or what chords they're playing over."

guitarlessons,3dehkq,circleof5surecanjive,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:52:54 2015 UTC,Blues is a I-IV-V progression using all Dominant 7th chords. A great what to start comping is to lean your dom 7 arpeggios and create melodies that follow the progression. Leaning licks and scales has its place as well but melodic solos are better. Try using target notes like the one and the 3rd for the first beat of each measure and try to make good solid stand alone melodies.
guitarlessons,3db3qf,aykevin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:11:28 2015 UTC,"Hi! This is a great song for beginners, several open chords, only one barre chord (Bm), the most challenging part is the ""rhythm"". There are several techniques going on, I would like to pinpoint each one:   Fingerpicking: Playing separate strings with different fingers. Hammer-on: Playing a note and, consequently, ligating the next note by ""hammering"" the fret with your finger. Arpeggio: Playing the notes of a given chord separately. Mute strum: This is the one you're looking for. It's like strumming but instead of letting the strings ring, you immediately put your hand over the string, like if you were slapping softly the strings. This gives a percussive vibe to your playing. Here's the video I found for this technique."
guitarlessons,3db3qf,Pelusteriano,2,Wed Jul 15 05:14:24 2015 UTC,"I've really been working on the finger-style (more hammer-claw I think) used in this walk through of Vultures.  It's a really well done walk through, but I'm having trouble making it click.  I've worked on and off over the past few weeks, but it still doesn't sound or feel right.  It's not so much a mute strum as a percussive hit with your palm while striking some of the strings with your finger tips on the way down."
guitarlessons,3db3qf,Ferrocile,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:36:00 2015 UTC,"Its a finger picking method. You use your Thumb, index, middle and ring fingers to pluck the chord then slap them back down to mute the stings which causes the percussive sound when the strings bounce off the frets.

That being said, this is not a ""one chord challenge"". A more accurate title would ""one key challenge"" which is significantly less impressive (not that I don't like what they did).  For example, the guitar player is clearly playing A maj - D maj.  The Grateful Dead were stretching out riffs like this for hours and hours and (in my opinion) Jerry never got stale and I always thought that was impressive as fuck. One of the reasons I respect him so much as a guitar player."

guitarlessons,3dakp5,Tinkletyme,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:57:50 2015 UTC,"The C chord and the Am chord are related because they share the same notes. The C note is the minor 3rd of Am. So the A minor pentatonic scale works over a C chord.  I think the second part of your confusion is about positions. If you play from the second step of F# minor pentatonic (the A note), you'll get the A major pentatonic scale. So in ""soulshine"" in Bb, the second step of G minor pentatonic is Bb, so it's actually Bb major pentatonic. Or, to put it another way, G minor pentatonic ""works"" because it's the relative minor to Bb."

Am I making sense?  I watched the Marty Schwartz lesson on mixing the major and minor and that part about Am going with a C major pentatonic just threw me the hell off."

guitarlessons,3dakp5,circleof5surecanjive,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:01:49 2015 UTC,"A lot of blues players mix major and minor pentatonic when soloing. But that is because they are soloing over dominant 7th chords. And also because they have been playing long enough to understand how to do it properly. It is NOT easy.  So when someone tells me ""Lets play Blues in A"", I can mix the A minor pentatonic (shares the same notes as C major) and the A major pentatonic (shares the same notes as F# minor).  But if someone tells me ""Lets play a song that I just wrote, the key is A minor"", then I absolutely would NOT play in A major pentatonic because it would clash like crazy."

guitarlessons,3d7jda,BrodieSKIDDLZ,3,Tue Jul 14 03:13:18 2015 UTC,"It seems like you're missing a key component to make sense of it all. My advice to you: focus on arpeggios. Practically all melodies you hear are based around the overlapping chord. If you know what a chord is comprised of, then your ability to create melodies will improve dramatically.   For example: a Cmaj chord is made up of the notes C E and G. 1st, 3rd, and 5th. That is the formula for a major chord. After you learn the formulas for all types of chords (major, minor, diminished, augmented, and dominant (which falls under the major)), start to implement the extended notes of the chord. Staying with the Cmaj chord, those notes are the major 7th (B), 9th (D), 11th (F), and 13th (A). Most melodies work this way.   So, to recap: if you haven't learned how chords are constructed, do so. Pick a key and learn all the arpeggio shapes that you can, and learn them in different positions. After that I think most of your questions will be answered.   There are no rules in music. Every note played over any chord has a unique sound. And based on its context it can sound either good or bad."
guitarlessons,3d7jda,eat_hickory,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:49:11 2015 UTC,"I'm almost positive I'm missing something haha. I have all my formulas memorized, for chord all chord types, as well as the intervallic formulas for all 7 modes.   Side note: Actually I used a really unorthodox method that as far as  I know, I just made up, for learning modes and chord formulas. If anyone wants a copy I can type it up.  As of right now I have F major  memorized to the point where i can happily improvise all day without any sour notes. However i'm still not comfortable with accidentals and what not, and even at that my improvising is truly just me a-melodically hitting random notes of the F maj scale. To my family it sounds awesome. To me, it sounds like I'm trying to drive with  a blindfold on  except I never actually fall off the main  road. I just teleport to different points if that makes sense. Its just not melodic. More random.   I like your explanation of extended chords though. It  seems like I could play any solo i know, and with every single individual note that gets played, I could theoretically slow it all down and assign each note to an extended chord?   Meaning if I play an arpeggiated D minor in the ""E shape"" e10 B10 G10 D12  and raise the high e string to 12(e), I could call it a D min9?  That Should look like a tab staff. I know its gonna mess up once i post it^  My god thats hard to explain without a physical guitar to show you haha."
guitarlessons,3d7jda,eat_hickory,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:10:26 2015 UTC,"It would be a DmAdd9. A Dmin9 is implying it has the minor 7th as well. Same with DmAdd11 / Dm11.

I have a ridiculous goal for myself to completely master guitar one day and to have an absolute understanding of music theory. Which I believe is totally possible. I mean some humans did all the math and developed music theory AND the guitar fretboard and they must have had total comprehension. So at least I know it's a plausible goal to have!

guitarlessons,3d665k,chronopunk,8,Mon Jul 13 21:03:16 2015 UTC,"Learning how to tune with Hz is truly confusing at the beginning. Drop off that for now and get a more intuitive tuner.  Ideally, you should buy a tuner at a music shop, they're very cheap since they are fundamental for several players. But, for now I offer some other options:   For PC: AP Tuner. You will find the download to PC link down below. This is more intuitive since it displays on the center the note your string is currently on, it shows how off you are (if you need to wind or loosen your tuner) and, at the right, it shows in which notes you want your tuning. For Android: gStrings. This is the tuner I use on my phone, it weights less than 1 MB, it's incredibly intuitive and easy to use.   I don't know of a good app for apple devices, sorry."

guitarlessons,3d665k,GaryMutherFuckinOak,6,Tue Jul 14 00:18:28 2015 UTC,"BTW: Just a little background on tuners-- very few are able to super-reliably find the pitch. A number of things contribute to this. The ones that are physically attached to your headstock have some advantages because they ""feel"" the vibration rather than rely on a microphone. Still, though the lower the note the tougher the tuner will find it to lock on to the pitch because there are few cycles-per-second for it to compare to.  The second problem that all tuners have is that your strings vibrate at many frequencies. There is the fundamental (lowest frequency) which is how many times the entire length of the string vibrates but the string also wobbles at twice that frequency (an octave) adding richness to the sound. This first wobble is at the midway point of the string (called a resonant node). The the string also has another wobble (node) at 1/3 the length of the string. This adds a pitch that is a perfect fifth to the over-all timbre of the instrument. It's great for richness and it's hell on tuners. They'll sometimes flash to the octave (880 hz.) and/or to the fifth (E at 1318.51 hz.).  These extra fluctuations that make up the timbre follow a pattern called the overtone series. It's fascinating, but you're probably suffering from TMI (too much information) at the moment. I just wanted to explain why tuners flash around, identifying different notes sometimes."
guitarlessons,3d665k,carlEdwards,3,Mon Jul 13 22:47:54 2015 UTC,As near as I can tell the tuner is set up for A (at 440 hz.). That means you want to pluck your 5th thinnest (or 2nd thickest) string. When the green light in the middle lights up you're golden. Now you can proceed to tune the 4th string (D) to the pitch of the 5th fret of your A string. Then the G string to the fifth fret of the D. And so on.  Edit: A pitchfork tuning uses the same principle.  Addendum: The Guitar Toolkit tuner for iPhone is great!
guitarlessons,3d665k,carlEdwards,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:28:49 2015 UTC,If you are a beginner you should try tuning just one string then practice different tuning methods and train your ear to tune the guitar. I have found the best method for tuning is tuning to one string 5 open (A) first 5th fret (a) 6 open 1 open 4 2nd fret (E) first open 3 open first 3rd (G) 2 open 1 7th (B)

guitarlessons,3d6xq5,stevienic,10,Tue Jul 14 00:20:34 2015 UTC,"If i'm not mistaken, a capo mimics the nut of your guitar. When you put it on, say, the seventh fret, that's the lowest point where you can now make sound."
guitarlessons,3d6xq5,duke_lucas,5,Tue Jul 14 02:19:26 2015 UTC,This is the best explanation I've seen so far.  Another way of looking at it is that it mimics your finger holding down all the strings across one fret.
guitarlessons,3d6xq5,cannit_man,9,Tue Jul 14 02:59:56 2015 UTC,"If you put a capo on the second fret it raises the pitch of every string by 2 frets. You can go ahead and play any chord in the open position, but it will be one full step (two frets) higher. For example, A (002220) becomes a B chord.  Why would you want to do this? Well, for one thing, singing. It is an easy way to change the key of a song into your preferred singing key without using barre chords or thinking too hard about transposition.   Second, it allows you to use familiar fret-hand shapes and patterns in other keys. In this video, Justin Townes Earle plays his song Slippin' & Slidin' with a capo on the 4th fret. The chord shapes he is making look like the chords C, G and F. but it's all moved up 2 full steps (4 frets.) So the song is in E, right?   https://youtu.be/EPjzp1TK1O4  At 1:40 he starts the little solo that relies on the pinky finger run that would maybe be more difficult in the open E position. So, if you write a riff that can only be played in the open C position (or you prefer it in that position,) but you sing it better in E, you can easily transpose it to E by putting the capo on the 4th fret.    Third, some people just like the way it sounds. I have an old Gibson that chimes like a bell when you slap the capo on. Like it's made for it.  I am only a beginner to low-intermediate player, but tackling this question seemed like it was within my reach."

guitarlessons,3d6xq5,circleof5surecanjive,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:55:55 2015 UTC,"You know how some players like to down-tune their guitars?  That involves literally tuning down each string.  What a capo essentially does, is ""up-tunes"" it, by clamping it down on whatever fret you want.  So if you have a guitar tuned to standard E, and clamp the capo on the 5th fret, now your guitar is basically ""tuned"" to A.  All your notes and chords will be in a higher register.  You'd be surprised how many songs out there utilize a capo.  Hope this helps!"
guitarlessons,3d6xq5,wartooth6,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:36:00 2015 UTC,"From what I know, Capos basically replaces the Nut of the guitar and makes the string more high pitched. So if you were to play an Em chord without a capo, you'd play it with your fingers on the 4th and 5th string of the second fret. But if you were to put the Capo on say the third fret, you would end up playing the chord on the 4th and 5th strings BUT on the fifth fret because that's the second fret from the Capo. Any frets before the Capo are unplayable anyway. The capo is really useful to make the music more high pitch, especially when you're singing. You might have a really high pitch voice and if the guitar can't match up with your voice, then out a capo on and you can Singh and play and still sound great. That's literally all I think there is to a capo. It's really common amongst PPP music and PPP rock."
guitarlessons,3d6xq5,Gaminguitarist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:43:38 2015 UTC,"All a capo does is hold down all the strings at once, making the fret that the capo is on the new ""open."" For example, if you put the capo all the way up on the 5th fret, you can play the open chords of the song next to the capo where you would normally play it next to the nut.   It's best used for playing a song with chords if you want to brighten up. When you barre, your finger that is barring is acting like a capo."

I'm no professional and the only music theory I had was guitar class in high school so if this is wrong please don't kill me!"

guitarlessons,3d4hqr,alry07,7,Mon Jul 13 13:27:43 2015 UTC,"Let's go with your example of playing G Dorian on a G-C-D chord progression. Dorian is the scale that's derived from the Major scale by flattening the 3 and 7. The G Major scale is G A B C D E F#, so G Dorian is G A Bb C D E F.  If you play these notes on the chords, you're playing G Dorian. It has nothing to do with specific positions, fingering shapes etc. You can play G Dorian in any position you like.  BTW in this case it might sound a bit weird because Dorian is a minor scale and the progression is in G major, but you might like the sound and it can definitely be made to work, especially if the chords are played as 7ths with a bluesy or rocky kind of feel... but that's just a style thing.  For the theory you might find the first chapter or so of my free ebook helpful. There are also some potentially useful links in the FAQ. Good luck with it!"

I might still be a little confused but I will see if the book helps.  I might have to take a few steps back then re-approach the concept.  When I said to play G Dorian starting on the G root, I meant the ""shape"" that I had memorized, not even necessarily the notes of the G Dorian.  I was taught the modes starting on G, so I always played Dorian starting on A.  So I thought starting on G, then playing the shape I learned on A would give me the ""G Dorian"" sound.  Seems like I was more than a bit off on that though.  I hope I am not babbling incoherently."

guitarlessons,3d4hqr,bonzai2010,3,Tue Jul 14 08:13:16 2015 UTC,"You don't ""use"" them exactly, and they aren't really a thing like a scale.  For example, let's say you're playing over So What, and it's almost all Dm7. You could play the notes in F major (containing Bb), or you could play the notes in C major (no Bb). In one case it's Aeolian (natural minor) and in the other it's Dorian.   The Dm7 only defines 4 notes of the scale for you (D,F,A,C). The rest are up for grabs. You can make it sound however you want. You could even pick Bb major (Phrygian). Your solo would sound weird, but if your band mates picked up on it, you could go down some interesting rabbit holes.   Your just pivoting around the incomplete information laid out by the chord."
guitarlessons,3d4hqr,PansOnFire,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:56:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply.  Interesting take on it.
guitarlessons,3d4hqr,garbear007,3,Mon Jul 13 20:23:18 2015 UTC,"OK, so Dorian, for example, like /u/rcochrane said, is derived by making modifications to the Major scale (flattening the 3 and 7).    You would then take this modified scale, and assemble your chords from it.  G Dorian position 1 would be the 1-3-5, position 2 would be the 2-4-6, position 3 would be the 3-5-7, and so on.  From this, I get: Gm, Am, A#, etc.  Those are the chords that would fit the best to play a Dorian scale over.  There's a handy internet tool for this here: http://all-guitar-chords.com/scales-to-chords.php"
guitarlessons,3d4hqr,garbear007,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:11:03 2015 UTC,That is a great tool  I appreciate the reply.
guitarlessons,3d4hqr,circleof5surecanjive,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:19:51 2015 UTC,"I think of modes as being useful in 2 different ways: (forgive the formatting, I'm on mobile).   1) Finding a different place to play the same scale. Let's say I'm playing over a ii V I in the key of C, so my progression is Dm, G, C. So for the C chord I can play a simple C major scale (C Ionian). We know a C major scale works over this entire progression but it would be boring to stay on this one shape the whole time. So over the Dm we can play D Dorian (which uses the same notes as C Major) and over G we can use G Mixolydian (same notes once again). This whole time we have not moved outside of the C major/Ionian scale, but it allows us to spice up our playing just a bit by moving to new positions as the chords change.   2) Different flavours. So each mode is some variation of a major scale (or a minor scale I suppose). You can analyze the notes in your scale to find out when it is most appropriate to use these scales. For example, because a Mixolydian scale is a major scale with a flat7 (Eg. C D E F G A Bb), it's cool to use this scale over Dominant chords (C7). When playing the blues of course this is very useful, you can just play the mixolydian scale on each chord. (eg C mixolydian over C7, F Mixolydian over F7, G Mixolydian over G7). Each scale has its own flavour, for example I like to try a Dorian scale thrown in whenever I use a natural minor scale to give it a little cooler sound, or a mixolydian scale over an epic rock solo.    Hope that made some sense, feel free to ask any questions!"
guitarlessons,3d4hqr,circleof5surecanjive,2,Mon Jul 13 18:48:47 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  That may help, I need to play around with this.  Thanks for the reply!  I definitely may have questions once I start digging into this."
guitarlessons,3d4hqr,trackday,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:17:49 2015 UTC,"One more thing regarding your original comment about the Ionian scale not sounding right over the G C D progression... It all depends on what style you're going for. For me, if it's a rock/pop/blues style I usually go straight for a minor pentatonic. It's cool, it's familiar sounding, it works. Playing an Ionian scale works in theory, but not in practicality. Using a major scale for soloing is not the most effective in this case, but sometimes a major pentatonic will work but it has a much different flavour than a minor pentatonic."

G is usually my go to just to mess around, I typically use my thumb to play the root g and this lets you go slightly lower than e lets you go, so I could play g and then go to f.  Listen to most white stripes or black keys songs and try messing around on the pentatonic scale, it's almost impossible to play a wrong note so just experiment and mess around.  The black notes on a piano make a pentatonic scale with its root being the d# so make a little progression like d# then c# with your left hand and just go crazy on any black keys with your right hand"

guitarlessons,3d2bk0,Bruione,3,Mon Jul 13 00:46:41 2015 UTC,"Remember, you don't have to span the entire fretboard to play a blues solo. A good exercise is to take a fragment of the pentatonic scale, say, three notes, and play a solo with only those notes. Listen to BB King to understand how effective that can be.   Also, you can take whatever minor pentatonic pattern you're playing, move it down 3 frets, and you're now playing in major pentatonic. I always loved Jimmy Page's solo in The Lemon Song where he gets quiet, plays major, then busts out a long loud minor riff."

Learning to effectively mix and match major and minor blues licks is a skill in itself."
guitarlessons,3d2bk0,macjohn,3,Mon Jul 13 13:24:45 2015 UTC,"Learn other peoples solos. Learn your favourite guitar player's solos. Hear a lick you like? Lift it and play it.  Analyze what you lift. That favourite lick... what chord is it played over? How does it fit into the scales you know? Try to sing the lick over a different song/chord and then figure out where on the neck to find what you sang.  Improvising melody is very similar, thought process wise, to how we improvise words in conversation. We learned that by duplicating what we heard, changing what we needed to change to find our meaning, then seeing how successful the result was. Soloing is the same. The grammar (theory) comes after, and helps us to organize our ideas to avoid sounding like we're blabbering like an idiot."
guitarlessons,3d2bk0,carmour,3,Mon Jul 13 03:53:41 2015 UTC,"I wrote this in a post about a year ago for someone wanting to learn blues guitar. Seems to be what you're asking so I'll paste it here.  I'm going to give you some information here that will get you up and going fast. If you take these first steps, learn them, and end up really enjoying what your fingers are creating, then take more steps to go farther. Even if you take no more steps, this will give you enough to impress your friends and even yourself.  Step 1 - Learn the minor pentatonic blues scale for boxes (shapes) 5, 1, and 2. Look it up. If you can't google ""minor pentatonic blues scale"", you have no desire to learn and should be taken out back and shot. You should concentrate on box 1 and the low/bass strings (E and A) of box 5 along with the high/treble strings (G, B, E) of box 2. You will be able to make a run up and down box one occasionally breaking into boxes 5 and 2 as you feel like it.  Step 2 - once those three shapes are memorized (use a metronome app or something to get your speed up), start noodling around with those shapes in the key of A to a youtube blues backing track (another easy youtube search). The 'key' is where you start box 1 of the minor pentatonic blues scale. In the case of 'A', you start on the 5th fret. All of the boxes/shapes connect together and repeat up the neck (but only worry about that once you decide to grow beyond this quick tutorial and learn all the shapes). Pay attention to your 'root' notes as those are good places to end a solo or run.  Step 3 - Understand that the major pentatonic scale is just the minor scale shifted back on the neck 3 frets. So, in the Key of ""A"", you move back from fret 5 for box 1, to fret 2. Boxes 5 and 2 connect the exact same way as they did with the minor scale. Here's the wild thing, you can plan play notes from the major scale OR notes from the minor scale in your blues solo. Look at how box 2 of the major scale overlaps box 1 of the minor scale. That gives you a whole lot more notes to play around with when you're soloing over a blues backing track. Start adding these to your solos when practicing.  Step 4 - Change keys. You've been in the key of ""A"", now try the key of ""B"" by moving everything up 2 frets. A lot of blues is in ""B"" and ""C"" so try moving it up 3 frets to ""C"". Move it up to the 12th fret for ""E"". Jimmy Page made a lot of the Whole Lotta Love guitar solo right there. Freddie King loves the key of ""D"" so take it back to the 10th fret and go crazy to some backing tracks in ""D"". Start looking up some youtube videos of BB, Freddie, or Albert King and try to figure out what key they are playing in (just find the repeating blues chords in the background and see what chord it starts in, that's almost always the 'key'). Try to copy a few of their licks. The more licks you can add to your repertoire, the more fluid your solo's will sound rather than just sounding like scale practicing. This is a great start. If you find yourself really digging this, then I think you can dive into some theory and learn how adding a few notes to these shapes can put you in different modes and give you very different sounds in your solos. The blues are pretty simple. No need for books, videos, or materials to get started. Do the steps above, and if you find yourself getting bored with it after a few months, then learn all 5 boxes and start learning about different modes.  Hope that helps."
guitarlessons,3d2bk0,newaccount,2,Mon Jul 13 18:42:55 2015 UTC,"Blues soloing is all about phrasing. It's all out there already, you just have to listen. Blues has a very particular sense of tension and release, and an almost predictable way of mapping out phrasing. Emulate vocalists."

guitarlessons,3d2bk0,garbear007,2,Mon Jul 13 12:23:32 2015 UTC,"A little late here but wholeheartedly agree with a lot of whats been said. I firmly believe that a good place to begin with lead is the 5 positions of E minor pentatonic - I wish I had not waited so long to learn this. Highly recommend going through these with something keeping time like a metronome. LumBeat, on Youtube, offers a whole bunch of simple 4 on the floor drum beats that I use when practicing. Patience is key in learning anything on the guitar so start slow and make sure you're playing clear, concise notes before you even begin to think about speed.  All of the notes in a single position are like words waiting to be used in a sentence. Broken down, you begin to hear phrases and musical expressions. Andy Aledort, from Guitar World, had a great video out there called ""Play Lead Guitar"" that has some great exercises demonstrating this. I wish I could find a Youtube link but the content I found was an 18 part video that came with a PDF booklet."
guitarlessons,3d2bk0,a1b2t,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:33:48 2015 UTC,"You've gotten lots of good advice here already, of course I have to agree you've gotta learn your minor pentatonic scale (just one position is fine for now!). Try to imitate the flavor of your favorite blues guitarists, there's a certain groove to it and technique compared to rock soloing, jazz soloing, etc.   My biggest piece of advise for a first-time solo-er is don't be afraid to make mistakes! It's called improvising for a reason. Long as you follow your scale, there are no wrong notes. Play with confidence, play every note with purpose, because you cannot go wrong. You will develop an ear for it in no time. Good luck and most importantly have fun!"
guitarlessons,3d2bk0,HerbertSpliffington,-4,Mon Jul 13 19:02:00 2015 UTC,"dont do scales, dont bother about licks first take out a metronome and count the beat. learn 8th 16th and all  learn the groove of the song, how to latch on the beat and follow it. do those  you can solo with just 4 notes and it will sound amazing if the beat is right  but you can slow with 2000 notes and it will be shit if the beat is off.  so first things first (assuming you haven't) learn how to groove"
guitarlessons,3d2bk0,a1b2t,2,Mon Jul 13 04:06:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, a ""solo"" can be anything - I probably wouldn't go so far as to say ""don't learn scales"" though - like....why not both?  Learning groove, feel and tone is super valuable though, for sure - and I think you raise a very important point  Warren Haynes sums it up well in this excellent and very grounded session"

Take a look at every link and check what you know and what you don't, everything I'm pointing there are skills and knowledge an intermediate player should have. At the end I'll give some further advice.    I've given lots of advice around here, I'll share with you some relevant comments I've made (most of them are very long but I always include extra material like videos and sites):   Where you should begin. Here. Three concepts that changed completely how I play guitar. Here. Figuring out strumming patterns by yourself. Here. Keys, melodies in key and chord progressions. Here. What you should learn to take your playing several steps further. Here. Intervals & arpeggios. Here. Finger exercises. Here. CAGED system for chord positions. Here.  Songs that will help you to develop as a guitar player. Here.  More on intervals. Here. Unlocking the power of scales. Here. Essential skills for jamming. Here. Playing all-around the fretboard. Here. Scales. Here. Sound before speed. Here. Circle of 5ths & 4ths. Here. Licks & riffs. Here.       You should focus on knowing your fretboard & some scales. Knowing the fretboard is a great advice, you can considerate yourself an intermediate player when you are able to identify the key of a song and play the vocal melody (picking it by ear). Learn songs that are outside your primary genre! I primarily play rock, recently I've been learning/playing latin jazz and it's broadening my knowledge about music & guitar. But, keep playing stuff you like! Learning harder songs will challenge yourself, and this would help you to develop more skills. But, before doing that, make sure you can play easy & medium songs flawlessly. In one of my linked comments there's a set of songs I recommend. This one.     I hope that helps! If you any further inquiries or want more advice, feel free to contact me!  Keep on rockin'!"

Change your tuning to something different, like DADGAD or whatever other open tunings, play wildly different genres(that you're normally not comfortable with, can also try new techniques along like slide guitar or chicken picking in country music), try to learn parts from classical pieces etc. Challenge yourself.  I've personally being playing for 3.5 years and the last time it happened I just took whatever pop songs were the top at the moment and tried to figure their chords, melody, song structure. Not necessarily related to guitar playing but it helped me improve my musical 'vocabulary'."
guitarlessons,3czmip,haydukk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:36:29 2015 UTC,Learning the fretboard better and more music theory is helping me. There's tons of great youtube lessons. You need to be able to identify why you are stagnating and go from there.

guitarlessons,3czmip,dannytheguitarist,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:16:53 2015 UTC,"I'm actually on my third now.  My first... I'm entirely self taught and figured out a good bit by ear. This means I know a lot of butt rock songs I don't really care about, but they were insanely easy to learn by ear. However, I didn't know chords, and trying to read chords looked like a foreign language.  Eventually, I forced myself to learn chords (or rather, what they actually were as opposed to guessing on finger placement). Got that, expanded a repertoire, and was happy... for a while.  Then, soloing. I couldn't solo for shit. Eventually, I kinda felt it out, but my soloing is pretty limited (despite playing for 20 years now, my pinky STILL doesn't do what I need it to do). I actually developed a unique style from this, as I was effectively self taught and used only three of my fretting fingers (excepting chords).  My new brick wall is music theory. I kind of want to understand it because I feel it could broaden my horizons. However, I'm at the same brick wall I was when I first started learning chords... it's like reading a foreign language.  Also, I'm very astounded as to how I got to a certain skill level by playing by ear and self taught for so long. I'm still wondering how the hell I did it, but I also feel like a ""fraud"" around guitarists who actually had lessons or whatever.  I'll tell you this much: if you play styles like punk, metal or rock, drop D tuning (DADGBE) does wonders for your fretting speed."

guitarlessons,3cx2g5,GlamAdmin,2,Sun Jul 12 00:00:44 2015 UTC,"I am still learning this, but my usage so far has been to only learn with roots on the fifth or sixth strings, and two learn a 'leaning back' version where the root is on a fret higher up than most of the shape, and a version 'leaning forward' where the root is on a fret lower than most of the shape (i.e. compare shape of a G shaped barre chord and an E-shaped barre chord)"

Practise changing between chords without stopping, even if you're making mistakes with your left hand. It'll force it to catch up."

Good luck!"
guitarlessons,3cx7x2,Sjaaq,2,Sat Jul 11 18:58:34 2015 UTC,"If you're not doing so already, make sure you practice with a metronome.  Think about your strumming hand moving like a pendulum insync with the metronome.  Moving up, down, up, down in a constant rhythmic motion.  Over time, you'll learn to skip playing strings on strums.  This will add depth to your strumming.    It takes a while for your hands to get muscle memory down for chords.  It just takes time.  Don't get discouraged and stop.  You have to power through!  But it takes practice!  Practice, practice, practice"

He did say one small, odd thing about the timbre sounding different based on geometry...which is I suppose partially true, but from what I understand it has more to do with the gauges of strings you substitute to the same notes on different points throughout the fretboard.

guitarlessons,3cq39z,Maybe_Im_Jesus,3,Fri Jul 10 05:47:06 2015 UTC,In classical music composers often specify which strings they want string players to play certain notes on to get a certain tone.
guitarlessons,3cq39z,JSW2K7,3,Fri Jul 10 11:08:22 2015 UTC,"He said it plays a little different because of the geometry. I'm not really a guitarist but I think he meant that when you're playing the same melody in different positions the shape changes which lend itself to different hammer ons, pulls offs, bent note, etc. Thus it ""plays a little different"". Just my take on it."

guitarlessons,3cpfr1,TheVegetaMonologues,12,Thu Jul 9 18:42:34 2015 UTC,"You will become a master when:    You take the topic, scales in this case, seriously and always perform at the edge of your level. You consistently challenge yourself to improve a skill. You feel proud of your work. You play with passion & freedom.   I'll talk about some very basics to understand scales, very useful if you want to master them.    THE FRETBOARD   TL;DR/W: Learn where are all the notes on the fretboard.   Before learning any scale, it is important to know where are all the notes all over the fretboard. Here's my favourite video about this topic and here's a diagram to help you further. You only have to learn from fret 0 to fret 12 in each string, since fret 0 and fret 12 are the same note and the order of the notes keeps repeating over and over.  Begin here.    KNOWING YOUR NOTES   TL;DR: Learn the notes and relationships of notes in your scales -the intervals-, not ""the shapes"". This will help you understanding why do some melodies sound like they do.   First, knowing the actual notation of the scale. This means, you must know which notes are being played in the scale. Very often, when you ask for advice, they tell you to learn the ""shape"" of a scale, e.g. the box shape of the major scale with root -red circles- on the low E. When you learn ""the shape"", yeah, you're playing the major scale but you don't really know what you are playing. You know where to put your fingers, where is the root, but that's it, you don't any idea how to use this in any context.  I'll use the C major scale as an example, since it is the easiest scale because it doesn't have accidentals (sharps or flats). So, the ""traditional"", i.e. major, natural minor, harmonic minor, etc., scales are a set of seven notes with a precise relationship between them and the scale root. The root is the most important note in any scale, since it's the note we're going to use to establish the relationships. The technical name of this relationships is called intervals.  Here's the chromatic scale (aka the scale of all the notes, with sharps), we'll be using this template, and here's the template for the intervals. The R stands for root, so, you can overlay this two templates and begin learning things: in C (you put the root on the C note), the major 3rd is E, the perfect 5th is G, etc. When you have successfully learned some intervals (I recommend C, G, D, A & E), you can proceed to make sense of this notes by playing a scale.  You may already know the major scale formula: Root - tone - tone - half-tone - tone - tone - tone - half-tone to go from root to root in a major fashion. Learning the scale this way is like learning the shape. You know the distance between each note, but you don't know the relationships, the intervals. How about we learn the major scale in terms of intervals? Here's the template for the major intervals. Overlay the chromatic scale with the major intervals. The root establishes the key.  For the C major scale the notes are: C - D - E - F - G - A - B. Speaking in intervals: C is the root or the 1st, D is the major 2nd, E is the major 3rd, F is the perfect 4th, G is the perfect 5th, A is the major 6th & B is the major 7th. You may have heard this words before, ""the third"", ""the major seventh"" may sound familiar to you, regardless if you know what they actually mean.   You can apply this to any other note in the chromatic scale. Try playing something in C major, you will notice that a certain succession of notes will sound good, pinpoint which intervals you are playing, thus, you will be able to transpose that succession to another key.    CAGED SYSTEM   TL;DR: For any key, the root, third and fifth note of the major or natural minor scale make the fundamental chord of the key. When you overlay this notes all over the fretboard, you will get the desired chord in every position. This will help you navigate horizontally the fretboard.   For the next topic I'll be using the E major scale. I recommend, at first, learning the scales in ""boxes"". Take a look at this image, it is the E major scale with a certain section highlighted. Play some melodies, i.e. sequences of notes, inside that box and hear what you are obtaining.  Here's another box, starting the highlighting at the 2nd fret. You may be asking yourself how I know which boxes to choose, look closely at the shapes the notes E - G# - B are making. At the end I'll tell you. Again, play some melodies inside this box.  Another box, starting at 4th fret. Beginning at 7th fret. And, finally, beginning at 9th fret.  If you kept a close look at the notes E - G# - B (which are the notes that build up the E major chord: Root - maj3rd & perf5th) you may have noticed that, in the first box (starting in open position) you got an E major chord in E shape. In the second box, at 2nd fret, you got an E major chord in D shape. In the third box, at 4th fret, you got an E major chord in C shape. In the fourth box, at 7th fret, you got an E major chord in A shape. Finally, in the fifth box, at 9th fret, you got an E major chord in G shape. What I have just pointed out is known as the ""CAGED system"", understanding this system is ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT for you. When you understand this, you can play anywhere on your guitar and still find yourself inside the key.    BRINGING THE SCALE TO LIFE  This is the most important part of mastering scales. For this part take a look at a video from a guitar clinic by Paul Gilbert, the relevant part begins at 1:25 to 1:52. He's playing the A blues scale."

guitarlessons,3ckzjx,shredgeek,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:52:59 2015 UTC,This is less useful than you guys think right now. Chords can be moved up and down the neck and once you can actually barre and learn shapes you have to memorize around 10 shapes instead of 120. Looking up all of this in how it's presented here will waste your time. Learn the difference between the chord shapes and how they are constructed with intervals is far more helpful. The note letter of the chord isn't all that important.
guitarlessons,3ckzjx,TheBashfulPanda,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:43:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed, this is a nifty web app but it is not how you learn to construct chords at all."
guitarlessons,3ckzjx,slappytheclown,0,Thu Jul 9 02:19:14 2015 UTC,"I kind of agree however, this shows inversions as well as non standard shapes you can arpeggiate. So I would argue that it may be helpful to those looking for more than say, 10 shapes especially for people wanting to really know the fretboard. Also take into consideration someone who has tuned the guitar app to some different tuning...this would display the chord in that tuning."

So that the watcher could then immediately go to a backing track in Dorian in start noodling around.  The second video then goes on to explain WHAT the Dorian mode is. Which is honestly not really beginner stuff and isn't supposed to be.  The third video will be about creating different chord progressions in Dorian.  So its like:  1: ""Dorian for Dummies"" or how to solo in Dorian mode right now   2: what makes it Dorian/intro to chord progressions  3: how to write chord progressions in Dorian"
guitarlessons,3ckae7,BrodieSKIDDLZ,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:01:36 2015 UTC,"No one ever explains the most important part when it comes to modes. Which chords you're playing over. A good way to check out modal sounds it to keep the root note of the mode in the bass of every chord.   In F major scale, Bb is Lydian. So try playing Bb, C/Bb, Bbmaj7. Then solo over that. Putting focus on the sharp 4 (E natural). That's the color tone. The slash chords will make it sound Lydian. While using the color tone will help Lydian scream at you."

guitarlessons,3ckae7,Count_Spockula,0,Wed Jul 8 18:10:44 2015 UTC,"Well the ""sound"" I was asking about was the lead. Because the first two videos are about soloing.  How are you with pentatonic scale shapes? Because if you understand at least that then you should be able to understand the 1st video.  Besides that, the cold hard truth is that without a solid understand of ""the diatonic scale"", then modes will probably always be hard to understand.  To be honest, it should be like that because ""modes"" are NOT really beginner territory. ""Beginner"" as far as an understanding of music theory, not necessarily guitar playing.  And yeah, thanks for the feedback. I hope I am not coming off as an asshole because I keep defending my video. My sound quality is not quite where I want it to be yet and I know that I still have a lot to learn about making videos, as I am just a solo guy sitting in his apartment trying to put these things together."

guitarlessons,3ceb21,iCCup_Spec,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:24:19 2015 UTC,I started playing with extra light strings after getting into playing with some country style string bending.

I tried with my guitar with .10 strings and in standard tuning and could get the bends to sound right, but it hurt and I could not play anything musical or in time.

Electric it felt much easier for me to span the fretboard.  Gotta be ready for the callouses from an acoustic.  Also a good idea since he said he doesn't have an amp.
guitarlessons,3c7zks,epderad,4,Sun Jul 5 19:24:15 2015 UTC,"I play the A using my middle and ring finger on the outer two strings and my pointer finger on the middle string tucked in behind. It might take a bit of getting used to having your fingers mashed together like that, but it will keep your fingers from laying over and muting other strings. This fingering also has the additional advantage of letting you use your pointer finger as an anchor when transitioning to an open E or D. Obviously ymmv, so try out a few options and see what works for you; it never hurts to be able to play chords more than one way anyways."
guitarlessons,3c7zks,niceguy191,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:32:29 2015 UTC,"The reason I play the 3 fingered A when I do is for anchor transitioning to things like open E and D.  When I am not transitioning to another ""anchored chord"" I find it better to do the mini barre."
guitarlessons,3c7zks,Bananafrosted,5,Sun Jul 5 21:35:13 2015 UTC,i just use a mini bard chord. use the pad of your pointer finger to press down each string for the A chord. its much easier.

guitarlessons,3c7zks,Freducated,2,Sun Jul 5 23:09:52 2015 UTC,I play it using just the pad of my middle finger. Essentially a one-finger barre cord on just three notes. You may have to angle your finger a bit so that the E string rings. I can send you a pic if it makes it easier to understand.
guitarlessons,3c7zks,MaxwellMrdr,2,Sun Jul 5 20:58:50 2015 UTC,"The three finger open A and barred open A have their own applications. It's a good idea to get comfortable with both forms and play to their strenths.    If you want a solid five string A open chord, then the three finger form is probably best. This form also lends itself well to suspended and major/dominant 7th chords, since you only have to lift one finger or apply the pinky in these cases.    The barre form is better suited for certain quick transitions, inversions, and Hendrix style flourishes where you need more than just your pinky. It's not particularly important that you get the high E to ring out here, unless you specifically want that sound. You're already playing that note on the D string, and chances are when you play this A shape up the neck with a ring finger barre you aren't getting the high E string to ring out then either. If you do want the high E to ring out, then you'd have to barre the three strings with the pad of your index before the knuckle, as others have said. Otherwise, you might angle your finger to the side to get more solid contact."
guitarlessons,3c7zks,ksully27,2,Sun Jul 5 22:43:50 2015 UTC,"1) Plant the pinky on the C#, ring on A, and middle on E.   2) While keeping the pinky JUST behind the fret, you can let the ring and middle finger fall back a bit diagonally towards the middle of the fret area. This can give hopefully you space and clarity."

guitarlessons,3c7zks,Strykrol,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:36:08 2015 UTC,"As far as getting it to ""ring out""- it is literally is just a practice thing. Repetition playing it and transitioning into and out of it to a new chord.  As far as which is better - different chords before/after the A chord in your progression will alter the way you need to finger it. There is no right way, no wrong way, and the more tools you have in your arsenal, the less chance you'll get tongue-twisted with your fingers when you need them to do as they're told.  Learn both ways, then learn more ways :)"

guitarlessons,3bvw8g,Pelusteriano,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:12:08 2015 UTC,"The deal with power chords is that, technically, they aren't chords. A chord is a group of three different notes. Any given power chord only has a root, the 5th and the root one octave higher, therefore, there are only two different notes. This is why they aren't very ""tasty"". But this same feature is what gives them a ""crunchy"" sound. The root and the 5th are the most powerful notes inside any scale.  You can use them with that purpose (playing powerful, crunchy progressions) or you can use them as an approach to the CAGED system. When you learn where to play every single power chord, you can play every single E, Em, A, Am shape chord anywhere on your guitar."
guitarlessons,3bvw8g,pepvaldez,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:07:39 2015 UTC,"What I usually do is alter the power chords and create new voicings (this may not be considered power chords but they are still diads played on the lower register of the guitar). I usually play the root on the 5th string and the 5th of the chord on the 6th string. The 4th interval will give the chord a different sound (and this is still a power chord). On a minor chord you could change the 5th for a m6 or do the same in a major chord but replace the 5th for a major 6th. You could also build chords like the ones Andy Summers play in every breath you take and treat them as a sus2 chord (but played on the lower register so you get the crunchiness of a power chord). Just experiment, be creative and maybe learn some tunes you like and learn some voicings."

Finally, do your ears a favor and play with a good and powerful distortion,  heavy metal is all about power chords but it's not boring :-)"

guitarlessons,3buugf,buccibane,3,Thu Jul 2 09:47:50 2015 UTC,"To (overly) simplify, you have to determine which chord 'feels like home' - that is basically the key it is in.    For example if a song begins and ends on a G chord, it is probably in the key of G.  It will likely have G, C, D (or D7) chords, and also possibly Am and Em.  Some other chords could sneak in, like F or A7 also.  There are exceptions and other conditions which change things though, you have to understand some music theory to get a more complete answer."
guitarlessons,3buugf,bggtr73,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:50:32 2015 UTC,"Like bggtr73 says, a quick rule of thumb is to look at the last chord in the song to figure out your key. ie. last chord = Am, then Key = Am.   WARNING: this only works if the song ends feeling ""resolved"" or ""at home"" or ""consonant"". If the song ends feeling ""incomplete"" or ""not quite right"", then they purposely ended it on a chord that was not the key (beware: JAZZ!)  The last chord is often a more reliable indicator than the first chord, because the resolution usually sounds more ""at home"" than the intro, but since the first chord establishes the context, it can also be a good guide.    PROTIP: if you learn to read music, you can determine the key unambiguously from the key signature, which is the typically the second piece of information on any musical staff (after the clef and before the time signature)."

guitarlessons,3buugf,bggtr73,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:57:27 2015 UTC,"I know two videos that cover this topic successfully:   Keys, Scales and the Concept of Tonal Center: Major and minor ""feel"" are explained, how to make the major and minor scales (on any key). It is explained in terms of ""whole tone"" (2 frets) and half tone (1 fret). How to Find the Key on Any Song: Some tricks to find the tonal center, thus, the key of the song.   A really handy website: http://jguitar.com/, you can search scales (and indicate the note name or the interval, i.e. musical term for distance between the root note and another note).  When you finally understand this and get the grip of how major and minor scales are made, you can play songs in a certain key.    To answer the latter, the G -major- scale is composed of the notes: G - A - B - C - D - E - F# (you can know which notes are sharp or flat in any key if you learn the circle of 5ths and 4ths).  The formula goes like this:   G is the root for this scale, thus we assign the I value. A is the second note for the scale, we assign a ii value. B is the third, so, iii. C is the fourth, so, IV. D is the fifth, so, V. E is the sixth, so, iv value. Finally, there's F#, we'll assign a vii° value.   As a rule, in any major scale, when you start making the chords for the scale:   I, IV & V will be major chords. ii, iii & vi will be minor chords. vii° will be a diminished chord.   So, in G major scale, the chords will be G, Am, Bm, C, D, Em & F#dim.  The I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, vii° values can be assigned in the same way to any other major scale; thus, you can transpose from one key to another. For example, if you have a chord progression that goes: G - Em - Am - D, which is I - iv - ii - V, you can use the latter to find the equivalent chords in another scale. In the C major scale (C - D - E - F - G - A - B), the progression would be C - Am - Dm - G.    If you have further inquiries, let me know.  Keep on rockin'!"

guitarlessons,3btnuc,mrstillwell,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:53:44 2015 UTC,"I would like to add... LISTEN. Listen, hard, to the players who inspire you, learn every nuance of every note of the songs that hit you emotionally. Air strum /pick  rhythm too. Seek out live recordings, your influences influences,  and their influences... Preferably using good quality gear if you can. Listening is an amazing way to learn and I'm really glad I grew up listing to music constantly, and pushing the boundaries of my taste.  It definitely helps me where I lack in other areas."

guitarlessons,3bpacq,neuropathica,7,Wed Jul 1 01:39:36 2015 UTC,"If you can play things by ear and contextualize what intervals you are playing, I think you are mostly there. Speed is something that comes with practice, in my opinion you have great learning habits. Just practice all the time. I have a guitar laying around my house always so when I'm bored sitting on the couch or watching tv I just mess around on my electric when it's not plugged in to try and get my speed up to par. It will take a bit, but it's worth it. Try and focus on a single lick and practice the shit out of it until you get faster then move onto the next.  Good luck!"
guitarlessons,3bpacq,clockjuice,2,Wed Jul 1 01:54:40 2015 UTC,"Yes this. Have a guitar around and while watching TV or whatever have something to practice. Work on a bit at a time and drill it until it's under your fingers. I spent many nights of my life practicing unplugged electric guitar while watching movies, triplets, sixteenths, parts of solos, etc. It adds up faster than you think. But it takes work...making it passive work feels less like work and the stuff becomes part of your guitar vocabulary faster than you'd think. But don't think for a minute that guy you see shredding or improvising amazing stuff didn't put in the time."

guitarlessons,3bpacq,thepathlessfollowed,5,Wed Jul 1 05:21:58 2015 UTC,"A good tip for developing the ability to play solos from songs is to download a music speed changer app. You can then highlight the part you'd like to develop and practise it at 50%. Once you have that perfect and can play it 5 times through without making any mistakes increase the speed by 10%. Repeat until you can play the piece at 110% speed.  I find once you can play it at 110% successfully you'll have it at 100% and be able to play it consistently  without effort.  If you have android download audio speed changer, it's a great app."

guitarlessons,3bpacq,bonzai2010,2,Wed Jul 1 05:24:11 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, you have to hear stuff in your head and be able to play it on your guitar. That's how we talk and that's how music should work if you want it fluid.  On your theory issue, keep in mind that b5 subs can exchange some really non-intuitive chords. G13 becomes c#7b9, which is a diminished chord that can slide around by minor thirds."
guitarlessons,3bpq09,jaykasten,5,Wed Jul 1 03:56:27 2015 UTC,"First off, you're not terrible.  Put that sort of thinking out of your head.  From the moment you pick up the guitar until the moment it drops from your dead hands, there will be things you're still working to improve on.    The paintbrush tip from other folks is a good one.  Keep your wrist loose and fluid. As you move your arm up and down it will naturally want to flick your wrist into the correct paintbrush angle.  Don't fight that.    Using a lighter pick, one that's more flimsy, can also soften the rough edges of your strumming as you're developing your technique."

It will amaze you at how certain concepts you think you will NEVER be comfortable with seem natural within days/weeks/months.  It's all muscle memory.   First you get used to gripping a chord, and it takes you 10 seconds to get the fingers right and play a clean sound, overtime it becomes instant...then switching chords..you think you will never be able to play a fluid song because whenever its time to switch chords, the music stops for 10 seconds as you switch to the next chord.  Then rhythm...strumming doesn't feel natural, upstrums are impossible...either you miss most of the strings completely, or you strum too close to the strings and you get a really awkward sound.  Then it becomes easier, then theres barre chords, they make you feel like you have started over again.    Etc etc they are all just hurdles, don't let them discourage you because if you keep practicing, one day that difficult concept will just click for you and it will seem silly that you ever had trouble with it."

I usually use med picks unless I'm playing real thick strings (I have 13's on my electric now) and I mostly play hard rock or metal with a lot of fast up/down palm-muting. But for one of my songs it's got a real fast strum and I can only really play it properly with a thin pick. Oh also hold the pick properly, not too loose but not a death grip."

guitarlessons,3bpq09,carannilion,3,Wed Jul 1 16:35:55 2015 UTC,Think of the pick as a very short paint brush.  The (imaginary) bristles should be pointed away from the direction of the stroke.  Practice getting the timing of the alternating angles in sync the up and down of the arm.
guitarlessons,3bpq09,LavenderG0Omz,2,Wed Jul 1 04:17:45 2015 UTC,"What this guy said about the brush. Also, if you angle your pick so it doesn't hit the strings flat, it'll flow easier through the strings.  Other than that, practice makes perfect."

guitarlessons,3bodur,MrBinns,12,Wed Jul 1 05:30:06 2015 UTC,"Standard guitar tuning is so because it makes it easy to play open chords by ensuring the full range of notes are available within every 5 frets. Alternate tunings are useful when you want a different range of notes. For instance, strumming open, in open D, the D note is hit 3 times, and so the sound is more robust. Certain chords become easier, some harder.   I often find myself stuck in a certain key, playing in an open tuning i haven't played in before helps me concentrate on melody and rhythem, because i have less of an idea of what I'm doing. I can't retreat to the familiar. I'm forced to abandon what I know, and I often discover new sounds that I like. Those things translate back into standard tuning. Just like reading a new author might compell you to read more, or less of that person's work-- by exploring you learn more about what you like, or don't like."
guitarlessons,3bodur,Joelpher,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:39:46 2015 UTC,"but aren't you just essentially changed where the notes are? according to my brief understanding of guitar theory the notes are still going to be there with alternative tuning, you are only changing their position on the fret."
guitarlessons,3bodur,Joelpher,7,Wed Jul 1 03:39:04 2015 UTC,"That's true. But there can be dramatic differences in the ease, or even possibility of which chords you play. I'm guessing by your username that you play drums. Imagine someone moved your snare behind your cymbals, and the rest of your set. It's still there, technically. It certainly is a lot harder to hit, but it's possible. Alternate tunings can be like choosing to move the snare really close by, or far away. It makes a difference. It affects the choices you make, musically. The idea of the notes still being there is along that same line of thinking. What's close and easy makes a lot of your decisions for you."

guitarlessons,3bodur,LongStoryShirt,2,Wed Jul 1 04:00:46 2015 UTC,"It makes a huge difference. Try it! My favourite is an Open G tuning which goes:  d B G D G D      It's great fun for folky stuff or just a very different sound. It totally changes the solo possibilities as well. Here's a silly song/video I did years ago that uses an Open G tuning. If you want to skip to the solo, it comes in about 1:30."
guitarlessons,3bodur,rhymes_with_chicken,7,Wed Jul 1 08:53:00 2015 UTC,"For a whole slew of reasons. I like tuning to Andy McKees tuning ECBEBE because you can discover new voicings, chords, and riffs that your fingers would not normally play. You can get in the habit of playing the same phrases repeatedly and it makes your brain and ears feel good to find alternative ways to express musical ideas or discover new ones."

guitarlessons,3bodur,Boy_Meets_Girl,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:58:39 2015 UTC,"A capo is the equivalent of tuning up, not tuning down. A guitar tuned down a half step or more plays lower notes than possible with standard tuning. Sometimes it's done for vocal reasons so the singer can hit the high notes more easily. Sometimes it's done because it just sounds good."
guitarlessons,3bodur,Boy_Meets_Girl,-2,Wed Jul 1 03:59:33 2015 UTC,"doesn't the capo turn the F to an F#, if so isn't that tuning DOWN as you're going DOWN the scale?   wow really downvote for a question in a students of the guitar subreddit. why am I not surprised?"
guitarlessons,3bodur,Josefus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:06:28 2015 UTC,"Up or down refers to pitch, not position.   Going up the scale is like that do re me song, each note is higher than the last.   Moving from the nut to the bridge is going ""up"", even though physically your hand might be lower than it was.   The high strings are the skinny ones, the low strings are the thick ones."
guitarlessons,3bodur,WhiskySage,2,Wed Jul 1 04:58:40 2015 UTC,so when you are tuning a guitar DOWN you are tuning DOWN the pitch hence tuning UP the keys? I mean that's just a tad confusing. If you go from EADGBE to F A# D# D# C F you actually just tuned it UP?

Note how beautifully the individual guitar parts fit together, and the resultant quintessential Stones sound. Try reproducing that with standard tuning - you can't!"

guitarlessons,3bodur,MrHarryReems,2,Wed Jul 1 04:02:14 2015 UTC,I know some artists tune down live because they can't hit the higher notes vocal wise that they once good (the Offspring is a good example). Also it opens up a different sound. Sometimes a song you may be writing may sound better in a different tuning. I personally prefer playing in Eb for most things I try to write.
guitarlessons,3bodur,surosregime,2,Wed Jul 1 04:02:23 2015 UTC,"It helps with finger-picking, plus DADGAD is pretty sweet."
guitarlessons,3bodur,MrHarryReems,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:13:45 2015 UTC,"For one, it changes the layout of the notes on the fretboard so certain chords and melodies will be easier to play (others maybe even harder, depending on the tuning). For example in Drop D the low E-string is lowered a whole step so all the notes on the E-string will move 2 frets towards the body of the guitar. As a result of that, powerchords on the E-String (now D) will be much easier because root, fifth and octave will be right above each other. You just have to barre over 3 strings and tadaaa you have a powerchord. Makes fast powerchord-riffing a lot easier. Also you got 2 more low notes (first and second fret on the E-string). Other open tunings will even make it possible to barre over the whole neck to create chords.   Another reason for detuning than making something easier to play would be to change the note range. Maybe you want to transpose an existing song into another range so your voice will fit. Can't quite sing the needed notes? Is it to high? Maybe you don't even want it to be that high. Downtune until it fits. Or downtune for the sake of opening the gates of hell in a massive ceremony of pain full of deep, deep tritone melodies."
guitarlessons,3bodur,surosregime,0,Wed Jul 1 10:58:44 2015 UTC,The point is to invalidate all of the effort you spent learning to read music and learn where all of the notes are on a guitar.
guitarlessons,3bodur,osmoso,2,Tue Jun 30 23:16:48 2015 UTC,"I see you are downvoted, but I essentially asked the question because upon reading the first 2 pages of guitar theory that is exactly my understanding of it. if you tune all your guitar strings down, you might as well use a Kapo, or barre it, or find where the new notes are.   My conclusion from this thread, is I guess sometimes it might open up the range of notes, other times it might ease the fingering for certain chords or something. But you don't see piano players tuning their pianos down so that the white keys no longer play a C major scale, but instead a D Major scale, they just learn where the new keys are. Maybe with the guitar stretching your fingers sometimes can be annoying.  anyway now that I got my answer, I don't see any reason not to carve the name of the frets  on my guitar in relation to standard tuning, as I am probably going to stick with it."
guitarlessons,3bodur,MrHarryReems,3,Wed Jul 1 03:50:27 2015 UTC,"That's my assessment as well.  I also play piano, and a few other instruments, and if you suggested moving the notes around on any other instrument, the player would look at you like you were insane.  Also, many guitar players don't learn to read music, so the concept of they don't understand why it might be important for the notes to stay put."
guitarlessons,3bodur,MrHarryReems,2,Wed Jul 1 03:56:12 2015 UTC,"Reading the stave (if that's what you are referring to) isn't really relevant here. It's about having the notes available to play, which isn't always possible on a guitar in standard tuning - notes that are either beyond the pitch of the instrument, or beyond the reach of your fingers (both problems can be solved with altered tuning)."
guitarlessons,3bodur,osmoso,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:37:26 2015 UTC,"Beyond the pitch of the instrument, so you need a note past fret 24 of the high E string?  I don't understand how reading music isn't relevant."

guitarlessons,3bodur,Melaronius,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:32:43 2015 UTC,"Many many songs, what are you talking about? You miss a lot of range by not tuning down, not saying you should tune down, but if you want to there is nothing wrong with it."
guitarlessons,3bodur,OranReilly,2,Thu Jul 2 00:03:35 2015 UTC,"Downtuning is about reaching notes below the lowest note on the guitar in standard tuning (the low E-string), and it's very common. Tuning the guitar higher to get notes beyond the highest E isn't very common, but yes it is the same logic.   7-string guitars became very popular in rock/metal in the 90's to address this, and more recently 8-string guitars. Players like Steve Vai, Tosin Abasi, Fredrik Thordendal come to mind if you'd like examples of that sound.  Fingerstyle players like Erik Mongrain or Andy Mckee use the aformentioned alternate tunings that were discussed, with open strings and less conventional chord fingerings. Enjoy"
guitarlessons,3bodur,AlterBridgeFan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:51:48 2015 UTC,"I guess there could be some technical details though with the guitar, as the piano seems way easier to play and I started playing the guitar first.

I have all sorts of PDF's and I made tab (although not rhythmically accurate... yet) for licks, songs, and other things that may aid the learning process. For the most part, figuring out by watching and following the audible representation will get easier the more you do it and it will sound more accurate because you inherently ""feel"" the music better than looking at tab. I can tell a player who mostly plays off of tab vs a player that figures it out by ear or by following someone. The feel is much more natural. Use tab/sheet music only as a reference, your ear is king in music."

The intro is also Am to F, with the melody residing only on the B-string (and a high E-string strum once I think). If you need help with that let me know.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=842-2seKblk"

guitarlessons,3bgagq,xMazz,2,Mon Jun 29 18:20:16 2015 UTC,"After about a year, I'd say you're right on track and the fact you want to learn more is awesome! I know plenty of students who would be happy being the guy who busts out wonderwall and wagon wheel at a campfire and leave it at that. So kudos to you!  I would start by learning the major/minor scale, the pentatonic major and minor scales, and learning what defines being in key.  After that, learn about what makes major, minor and 7th chords and beyond. Once you understand how chords are constructed you can use those notes as targets for your soloing.  Are you familiar with your hammer-ons, pull-offs, slides and bends? Practicing those while you noodle around your scales will help break up the monotony of just running up and down the scale.  Justinguitar and GuitarJamz are amazing resources for music theory on guitar. if you have the scratch I would buy a lifetime sub to guitar jamz, Marty is a freakin wizard."
guitarlessons,3bgagq,dickMcWagglebottom,2,Mon Jun 29 02:00:13 2015 UTC,"You've developed your technical/physical ability, so that's the #1 hurdle most people have a problem with. Now you're ready to actually start exploring and having fun. Learn the pentatonic in the first position and start playing with some backing tracks. Don't worry about technical stuff, just start exploring how stuff SOUNDS. This will start developing your ear... once you develop your ear a bit and start having fun, all the other stuff should start falling into place. You'll still have to learn new stuff from videos etc, but you'll be motivated and will have the ability to incorporate what you've newly learned into your playing because of your ear. I offer this advice because I was stuck in a rut for 20 years. I had never developed my ear or ability to improvise. Then I discovered playing to backing tracks and it changed everything for me."
guitarlessons,3bgagq,PontyPandy,2,Mon Jun 29 15:16:04 2015 UTC,"I think it is important to commit to learning full songs. Even if it's just at the simplest chord level. I think it's easy to get stuck going through a tab, picking up bits and pieces, then moving on to the next. Learn it and then memorize it. You'll learn a lot by pushing through the stuff that doesn't come easy, just like the last few reps when working out. This will also make you feel more accomplished and propel you to learn more."
guitarlessons,3bgagq,ohnoao,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:58:58 2015 UTC,"After a year, don't sweat it. Watch lots of YouTube instructions on what you don't understand.

Screwdrivers, nail files, drumsticks, anything and everything can be used to get sounds, so don't be afraid of getting rough with your guitar. For pedals, look into fuzz/OD/distortion and loopers if you want to keep it basic. As for technique, listen to John Fahey. He uses alternate tunings and dissonance to perfection, but more in a folk/classical way.   Also I only played noise and experimental for a good 6 months before I even learned a C chord, so you don't need very much technical knowledge."

Other than that, look into the classic player series. They're Mexican made, but address all the basic problems with these offset-body instruments and are generally well constructed, and retain the classic look fairly well. If you get a Japanese or American reissue you will have all the classic problems associated with these models and will likely have to spend money on mods if you want to 'play rough' at all."

Use what you know now, and you'll quickly see what specific things you want to get better at - more precise bends, different scale, speed, etc. All you learn new things, practise using them in your improvisations.  Creativity needs to be practised like anything else. There's a lot of players who can shred through specific solos and scale, but haven't practised just making things up, so they find jamming a real challenge."

They eliminate your ear and developing your ear is THE most important thing you can do in becoming a better musician. It's way more about what's in your head, than in your hands. Listening and watching is best because it brings it ""inside."" When it's inside, you have a complete understanding of what you're hearing and playing while reading tabs keeps it on the outside.

I sort of use them all together and rely on them at different times to motivate me.   My teacher has been trying to work me through playing over changes. It's tough. So it started with trying to connect lines within different scales.   I think the most important thing is that you have to have some idea of what you're trying to achieve. It would be much easier for him if he had some vision of where you were trying to go.

Most of the intermediate students I sit down can play the pentatonic scale in 14 different ways, but don't know what to do with them. A better approach is to conquer one position, and make it musical before moving on.

We tune-up, I give an example of the progression, show notes on the low ""E"" string and the scale for ""E"", then how to figure them out on your own, using the low-E string and power chords.  At first, I show how to do this on a single string in order to let you see it in a fashion somewhat similar to learning on piano, where it is all done in a linear fashion, which is less complicated.  Following lessons will be on doing riffs over the patterns, and doing the patterns in typically used forms rather than only in a linear fashion.   Hope you enjoy this."

When some one says ""it is a basic I-V-VI-V progression, in E"" you should have an idea what that means.  Timing, you should be able to stay in the pocket if you need to, and be consistent. It can be really annoying playing with some one who can't keep a simple rhythm going.  Learn different voicings for each chord. If some one is playing barred you can play Triads, it will keep it unmuddled.  EDIT: If you are all newer and and at the same level then fuck it, go play together and figure it out as you go."

guitarlessons,3ayout,hab1b,7,Wed Jun 24 18:09:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you already know, so this might be too basic for you.  Well you should know the fretboard (I guess not theory really)  Memorize the whole notes on the 6th and 5th string to start  Memorize barre chord shapes, use them with the root notes on the 5th and string If you need to just start with the Major and Minor for now.  Learn Triads so you can accompany rhythms  Also Diads But I would encourage you to learn triads first, but that is preference  Here are two good videos for moving around the fretboard  I-VI-V  Scale Practice and Movement  Always remember you are there to have fun, don't get nervous and shut down. If they are playing above your level try to learn something. If they ask you to start off or lead in just play something you know well and can play consistently. Music does not have to be complex to be fun, nor does it need to be complex to sound good.  If all else fails get on the bass ;)  EDIT: you can always steal the chords from one song and the rhythm from another and start jamming that way."
guitarlessons,3ayout,Pelusteriano,2,Wed Jun 24 18:25:55 2015 UTC,"that's exactly what i'm looking for. I have a lot of random or incomplete knowledge about playing, things like memorizing the fret board i got lazy with. I'm definitely gonna give it more effort. Thanks!"
guitarlessons,3ayout,revoman,6,Wed Jun 24 20:35:41 2015 UTC,"""What are some essential skills that I should have before jamming with others?""   I'll skip the very basics, like bringing your own instruments & gear, have your instrument tuned, arrive early to rehearsal, etc. Know your scales/common riffs, keys and rhythms. Take for example this scene from ""Back to the Future"". Marty tells them to play a ""blues riff in B and watch him for the changes""; he has never played with this band before, he assumes they know what he's talking about. You may think, ""well, what about it?""; he's being very informative. A blues riff refers to the 12-bar blues shuffle, which follows a I - IV - V chord progression; in B means that they'll be using the B major scale (conventionally, when you say a key and don't add anything more, it is assumed you are refering to a major key, i.e. it's only a minor key if you state so); watch me for the changes refers to keep listening what he's playing so they can preempt the chord changes and try to keep up refers to keeping the speed (stay on beat). Always tell your band the truth. This isn't limited to bands, this is for every relationship but it's totally appreciated in a band. What do I mean with this? Tell them that you are beginner/intermediate, tell them what you know to do, tell them what you are aware you don't know, tell them which are your current skills, in what you are working, when you are available for rehearsal, etc. Telling the truth will help you to keep a healthy relationship with your band. After all, everyone in the band depends on everyone else. Knowing how to change tunes quickly and fix some minor problems. Your singers needs this song to be in Eb? No problem, you must me able to retune in 1-2 minutes. Is one of the screws of your bridge loose? No problem, you must carry a screwdriver. Did one string break? No problem, you must have strings in stock.     ""What makes a jam session good?""   In general, having shared -musical- interests is helpful. You aren't going to have the best time if you are playing music you don't like. There are two solutions for this: a) expand the realm of the music you like or b) leave the band. Giving constant positive feedback or rephrase your negative feedback. Did you hear a specific drum part your liked? Tell it! ""Hey, that was cool! The pmch tss tss tss taka ta (drum sounds)"" Do you think your singer is out of tune? Don't tell: ""Hey, you are out tune and you sound bad"", instead say: ""Hey, I may heard wrong, can we check that part? I want to make sure I'm playing the right chord. Check. Oh, it seems to me you're a little bit high/low, why don't we try to arrange it?"". Remember: Offer solutions, not only statements of problems. Avoid trying to be the ""head"" of the jam. It's very common that one of the bandmates tries to take control over everyone and the rehearsal. Barking demands and trying to be superior are traits of this bandmate. You can express your corcerns (as I said in the second point of the first question, you must stay true), but you have to rephrase them in a way you're giving positive feedback. You can push-up the limits of your playing and the limits of your bandmates (this was one of the reasons why Deep Purple was so darn good! Keyboardist Jon Lord and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore were constantly ""proving"" each other; you can see this in their live performances). Chemistry. This is hard to develop, but you can give your best to create some chemistry.     ""What makes a jam session bad""   Not taking it seriously. If you show up to the jam unprepared (haven't practiced specific required songs or your skills), you'll be dragging down everyone else. Put on your bandmate's shoes. Bossing around. Again, put on your bandamate's shoes. Act with your bandmates as you want then to act with you."

guitarlessons,3ayout,AKG2000,2,Wed Jun 24 19:19:05 2015 UTC,"A lot of the skills can be learned at home.   Backing tracks can be a useful tool but since they give you the key and scale to use, they're not the best. I find the unpredictability of the radio to be the best.  Put on a radio station and play along to every song whether you like it or not. Learn whatever you can on the fly and add little things in here and there. What you don't know don't play, stop and listen and figure it out. If somethings weird just focus on the single notes until you get it.   You don't have to play the song exactly, remember you're just focusing on playing along. Add little licks here and there. Your ears know more modes and scales then your fingers know, want proof? Just try to hum a wrong note...you can't, so hear a line or melody in your head and transpose it to your instrument. If you get good enough at this you can play along with anything with very little theory.  This is the biggest mistake that I see in live jams. If you're sitting home trying to figure out a song by ear and a part comes on that you don't know, almost everyone will stop and listen to that part until they get a grasp on it. In live jams it's the opposite, most of the inexperienced players will try to play over it.  Sit back and listen to what's going on, if you're certain you've got in then dive in, if you're unsure then roll off your volume when you come in and stay out of the mix until you've got it.   There's nothing worse than someone who just tries to hammer their way through anything and everything without knowing what they're doing. If someone is being courteous and shows a willingness to learn then I will go out of my way to turn and face them and simplify everything, playing single notes or showing them an easier way or position to play it in."

Lastly, you can really grasp a better picture of why a guitarist is playing the way they are aka getting inside their head."

Definitely play over backing tracks -- there's hundreds on youtube.  I believe you will gain so much more and more quickly if you enjoy the practicing.  In other words you should set up your ""practice sessions"" such that it doesn't feel like practice.

guitarlessons,3at5g5,Daedalus42,17,Tue Jun 23 08:32:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know about anyone else, but that seems to be 7 times as complicated as it needs to be.   Learn the major scale by intervals: W W H W W W H. In C = C D E F G A B C   That's all you need to learn. One scale by intervals = the scale in every key.  All the modes use this scale, they just start and end from a different note in the scale.   Ionian = start on 1st note of major scale:   C D E F G A B C Dorian = start on 2nd note of major scale:  D E F G A B C D Phrygian = start on 3rd note of major scale: E F G A B C D E   etc.  One scale, 7 modes. I'm not a theory guy at all, so maybe I'm missing something but that's how modes make sense to me. Every lesson I see about them just seems to be over complicating what is a pretty simple concept."

guitarlessons,3at5g5,themaincop,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:21:30 2015 UTC,"Specifically, if you play starting on A, I think?  The other way to look at it is if you just play the white keys of a piano, but starting on different roots, then you get all the modes."
guitarlessons,3at5g5,FeignedSanity,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:09:44 2015 UTC,I haven't found this method of learning useful at all beyond understanding how they work.  For actually playing the scales if I just try to start on a different root I always end up sliding back into the major scale.
guitarlessons,3at5g5,blarghusmaximus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:23:18 2015 UTC,"What I would recommend (because I just did it and it helped me a lot) is to take a piece of paper. Draw yourself a fret board, draw out your 6 strings for a classical guitar, tuned E A D G B E or however you please. Go string by string, one fret at a time at write out which note it is. Then right out how many steps or half steps between each note, understanding where the #'s play in.  Then get a new fretboard and strings drawn out. This time throughout the fretboard just write in the notes for one scale, using your first picture as a reference if you need it, but try to do it by memory.  By drawing them out yourself rather than copying it down it may help click it in your head better. Then you can practice scales by using the fretboard reference you just drew yourself for each and every scale.  I'm pretty high and just came up with the idea and started doing it about 30 minutes ago and so many things have started clicking in my head and I'm starting to learn how to put it from paper to my guitar. So if I have something wrong or anyone has commentary on the concept, I don't claim to be an expert and am eager to learn more!"

guitarlessons,3at5g5,exscape,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:55:38 2015 UTC,"I agree, that makes it seem way more complicated. When first learning, I think it's simplest to just move one form of the scale around to different starting positions. Do that to a backing track with just the root note pulse (no chords or chord changes). To me that's the simplest way to 'get' the modes."
guitarlessons,3at5g5,AndrewJacksonJiha,3,Tue Jun 23 12:08:16 2015 UTC,"The article's way makes it clear what makes each mode unique, though.

guitarlessons,3at5g5,Bass_Cove,2,Tue Jun 23 13:26:58 2015 UTC,"Yep. Sure it helps you know how to play it, but it doesnt tell you the note that defines that mode. The one that is most important to its sound quality."

guitarlessons,3avfg6,The_Loch_Ness_Monsta,2,Wed Jun 24 03:49:09 2015 UTC,"I started off doing my first several months going to a friend's house and learning on an acoustic, pressing my fingers way too hard on a difficult bunch of wood, and I learned all of those open-string ""cowboy chords"" that are right there next to the headstock first. This D-chord that you're referring to is one of those most basic chords. Eventually I switched to an electric guitar and the lighter-gauge strings felt a lot easier to play on, but I still had a very tense left-hand for several years, I was always pressing too hard. I think getting used to playing different chord-shapes and feeling relaxed about it, and switching between them quickly and accurately is something that can only be learned through extensive practice. Work on accurately changing between an Amaj-shape and a Dmaj-shape and an Emaj-shape and a Cmaj-shape and a Gmaj-shape and an Am-shape and a Dm-shape first.  And then when you start eventually doing movable barre chords using the Emaj-shape and the Amaj-shape and the Em-shape and Am-shape then you will eventually get faster and more accurate with it."
guitarlessons,3avfg6,The_Loch_Ness_Monsta,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:19:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input.  I've actually moved beyond the open chords and have been practicing switching between open and barre, and moving up and down the fretboard with the same barre shape.  That said, maybe I need to slow a little bit due to the aforementioned D issues.  I also sometimes have issues with C, but I think I've worked that out...i dont think I was adjusting my hand well enough and kept muting the G string with my second finger.  I almost want to just learn the barre variations of the open chords at this point.  Is it very unusual for a guitar player using all barre chords when playing instead of using open chord variations?"
guitarlessons,3avfg6,The_Loch_Ness_Monsta,2,Wed Jun 24 17:05:19 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue was always having my hand muscles way too tense, pressing way too hard. It took me several years to really learn how to relax and just let it flow freely.   And yeah, I play Cmaj-shape as a movable-barre chord sometimes. I don't really barre my first finger all the way across the lowest fret, but sometimes use my pinky on the 5th string, ring finger on the 4th, middle finger on the 2nd string and use my 1st finger to barre across 1st-to-3rd strings. That one was challenging for a while, but once you've really got it down it makes chord changes a lot simpler. And similar to that would be the Gmaj-shape as a movable barre, I use my pinky on the 6th string, ring finger on the 5th string, and then 1st finger barre from 4th-to-2nd string (and mute the high string)."
guitarlessons,3avfg6,The_Loch_Ness_Monsta,2,Wed Jun 24 18:31:39 2015 UTC,"You know I'm definitely pressing too hard, I've tried holding the chords lighter, it seems like the bass strings you barely have the press but some of the higher ones you have to push a little harder.  Seems very unnatural to lightly press the strings, but like everything with the guitar, its all about training your muscles to make unnatural things feel natural."
guitarlessons,3avfg6,The_Loch_Ness_Monsta,2,Wed Jun 24 19:25:27 2015 UTC,"If I may ask, what type of guitar is it? Model and brand? Are you good at lowering the action and working on your setup? Get those strings a little lower & closer to the fretboard and that'll definitely make it more comfortable because you won't have to press down as hard."
guitarlessons,3avfg6,hamfraigaar,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:40:06 2015 UTC,"Its a Takamine Jasmine S35...total beginner guitar.  I have suspected for awhile that the action is off on the guitar as the low e string buzzes when playing and the first fret is at times difficult to press down on strings (I know its supposed to be harder than the others because its closest to the neck but this seems harder than it reasonably should be).  I have no idea how to do it myself, but I'm thinking of taking it into the local guitar shop for a proper setup."
guitarlessons,3aq5vc,thefollower,4,Mon Jun 22 16:37:22 2015 UTC,"I recently answered this question; here's the comment. I'll post the answer I gave that time.    To figure out strum pattern all by yourself you have to develop your rhythmic sense, since music happens over time. I'll help you channelize your inner percussionist and teach you how to count up to 4 in several ways.    What is rhythm?  Sounds have different durations and are separated of each other in certain ways. This property is called rhythm. Here's an excellent Ted-Ed video on visualizing rhythms & beats.    How to figure out rhythms   The 4/4 time signature is very common in western music. It basically is four beats of quarter notes. Let's count: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 . . . Each beat has the same duration.  Let's apply this to the real world. Go to your preferred audio streaming program/app/website and play any song you want. Listen carefully to it. You may feel an underlying beat. 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 . . . Tap your feet to this beat. Keep listening. You may notice that there is more happening.  With your hands try to hit your knee -from the leg that is tapping to the underlying beat- to the extra beats. At first you will find this difficult but it gets easier.   Some songs to exercise (you can move to the next song when you feel you have the rhythm of the current song). I'll cover lots of genres, just to develop your rhythmic sense: pop ballad, upbeat rock, grunge, pop, R&B, funk, swing, cumbia, salsa, surf, rocknroll . . .  With some practice you will be able to figure out within seconds the rhythm of any song you listen to. Keep practicing!    Moving rhythm to guitar  Strumming involves two movements, downwards and upwards. Let's mix time signatures and strummin direction. The simplest way is one quarter beats with only downward strums. Practice your strumming patterns while muting the strings with your fretting hand.    1   2   3   4   1   2   3   4 |-▼---▼---▼---▼-|-▼---▼---▼---▼-|   Practice this strumming pattern until you don't miss for a whole minute. I totally recommend timing your practice. When you're done move to the next strumming pattern.  Quarter notes and only downward strums aren't very vibrant. If we try a faster note duration, eight notes, maybe things will change. In a 4/4 time, you can stack eight beats of eight notes. To count with eighth notes you add a ""&"" between numbers. You will also add upward strums at every ""&"":    1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &   1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & |-▼-▲-▼-▲-▼-▲-▼-▲-|-▼-▲-▼-▲-▼-▲-▼-▲-|   You can notice immediately how it changes the feeling of the rhythm.  To move on let's try some combinations with quarter and eighth notes! How about: Quarter, eighth, eighth, quarter, eighth, eighth? Remember, 1 quarter note = 2 eighth notes.    1   2 & 3   4 &   1   2 & 3   4 &  |-▼---▼-▲-▼---▼-▲-|-▼---▼-▲-▼---▼-▲-|   Now try: Eighth, eighth, quarter, eighth, eighth, quarter. Remember: Numbers are downwards, &'s are upwards.    1 & 2   3 & 4     1 & 2   3 & 4    |-▼-▲-▼---▼-▲-▼---|-▼-▲-▼---▼-▲-▼---|   Create any rhythm you want using only quarter and eight notes. For now, keep inside a 4/4 framework.    Note duration  In music we have different note durations:  Slow.   Whole: 4 beats (a full 4/4 measure). Half: 2 beats. 1 whole = 2 halves.   Most common and versatile.   Quarter: 1 beat. 1 half = 2 quarters. Eighth: 1/2 beat. 1 quarter = 2 eighths. Sixteenth: 1/4 beat. 1 eighth = 2 sixteenths.   So fast they aren't common at all.   32th: 1/8 beat. 1 sixteenth = 2 32ths. 64th: 1/16 beat. 1 32th = 2 64ths.   Create new rhythms using durations from whole to sixteenth. To stack 16th notes you count like this: 1 & & & 2 & & & 3 & & & 4 & & &  For example:    1       2       3   &   4 & & & |-▼-------▼-------▼---▲---▼-▲-▼-▲-|   Write lots of rhythms, focus on accentuating either the 1 and 3 or the 2 and 4 beats. Remember: Mute your strings while you practice, numbers are downwards, &s are upwards.    Emulating a drum set  Finally, you can subdivide the strings of your guitar: Lower three and higher three. Try what Paul Gilbert shows at the beginning of this video -ignore the rest, I just wanted to show you how to subdivide. Couple your rhythms with the subdivision of strings and voila! Now you have all the skills required to strum any song you want!  Keep on rockin'!"
guitarlessons,3aq5vc,Pelusteriano,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:16:43 2015 UTC,This is an excellent explanation.
guitarlessons,3aq5vc,2sticks6strings,2,Tue Jun 23 23:16:51 2015 UTC,Buy this book and make it your rhythmic bible: http://www.amazon.com/Progressive-Steps-Syncopation-Modern-Drummer/dp/0882847953
guitarlessons,3aq5vc,2sticks6strings,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:57:32 2015 UTC,Could you elaborate? Are you just strumming on the drum beat? I am intrigued
guitarlessons,3aq5vc,hab1b,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:59:48 2015 UTC,"The book can be used in a bunch of different ways. For every exercise it shows two lines of notes, the kick drum, and snare drum. You can tap your foot in time with the kick to help feel out the rhythm. The snare line is the main thing you care about.   Exercise 1 Pick a pattern, pick a chord. Play them together. When you feel comfortable with the pattern pick two more chords and play chord 1 for 2 bars, chord 2 for 1 bar, and chord 3 for 1 bar.   Exercise 2 Pick a pattern, pick a scale. Play the pattern on the root note of the chord until you feel comfortable with it. Then for each quarter note's(1,2,3,4) value move to the next note in the scale. So for instance if the pattern is the following and the scale is A minor pentatonic:  2 1/8 notes, 4 1/16 notes, 1 1/4, 2 1/8 notes   X-X-XXXXX---X-X-| A-A-CCCCD---E-E-|G-G-AAAAG---D-D-|  Or some other variation that you can apply that marries the rhythm and the notes or chords you want to use. Its up to your imagination.   You absolutely have to use a metronome, I cant really stress that enough. Anyway with enough practice from this book, especially the syncopated section, your rhythms can/will be interesting, and any drummer you play with will love you.    I hope this helps, if you have any more questions please feel free to ask."

guitarlessons,3aq5vc,2sticks6strings,2,Tue Jun 23 23:13:46 2015 UTC,I've been playing a similar length of time and find myself in a similar rut.  What I've been doing is finding simple songs with distinct but different rhythms and practicing them over and over and over again.  Just working on getting muscle memory built up for more strum patterns.
guitarlessons,3aq5vc,petelyons,2,Mon Jun 22 19:12:22 2015 UTC,After I learned Mumford and Sons' strumming patterns I broke that habbit haha.
guitarlessons,3aq5vc,austhyma,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:09:37 2015 UTC,This would be my advice: learn the strumming patterns of the artists/songs that you like. Sing to those songs while playing using those strumming patterns. Make up your own songs with the strumming pattern you've learned from these other songs and artists. It takes a little work to drill these techniques into muscle memory.

guitarlessons,3arwko,vBubbaa,6,Tue Jun 23 00:40:28 2015 UTC,"The word 'key' can mean a couple of different things in music. At this point in your learning I recommend getting to grips with the 'home base'/'tonal centre' definition.  By this definition, the key directs you to the note which everything else in the tune is centred around and referenced against. The simplest way to hear what this means is to play a song which is said to be in a given key. If you start and finish the tune on the key note/chord, you will notice a sense of completeness; you start at 'home', journey along through a series of notes/chords, and finish back home. Everything sounds complete. You have 'resolution'. You can relax. You should emphasise your appreciation of this effect by stopping at a point in the tune which is not the key note/chord; you will feel the tension very clearly. It sounds unfinished. Anyone but the most profoundly tone deaf can hear this suspense, and anyone vaguely musical will feel uncomfortable, like they have gone for a walk and ended up stranded somewhere unfamiliar...  For example, play the following chord/note sequence:  |G |D |C |G |  Notice how when you land on the G at the end, it really completes the sound? Ah, sweet resolution!  Now try replacing that last G with a D, and stop there. Gah! It's not finished! Where am I? I am trapped in suspense.  So, usually, the first note or chord played in a tune indicates/dictates the key, and even more usually the last note or chord does so too.  Each note or chord you play other than the key (or 'root') has a characteristic sound according to its distance in pitch from the key/root; if you play a D chord in the key of G it will sound completely different to a D chord played in the key of B. This concept is known as harmony.  So there you are. Experiment with resolution and suspense. If you have a tune and you're not sure of its key, use your ear; the note or chord which makes the tune sound complete is (by this definition) the key. You will find that the vast majority of the time it is both the first and last one in the tune."
guitarlessons,3arwko,callmelucky,2,Tue Jun 23 01:27:14 2015 UTC,Very cool! That makes a lot of sense. Perfect explanation. Do you have any reccommendations of where to go from where I currently am?
guitarlessons,3arwko,callmelucky,5,Tue Jun 23 01:33:34 2015 UTC,"Firstly, don't rush any of this theory stuff. Seek out plenty of stuff that demonstrates each new concept you learn before charging on. If you are learning something that isn't really gelling, just go back to learning how to play songs you like, via TAB or a teacher or whatever. A common big problem for people learning guitar is they rush (or get rushed) straight into concepts like scales without having any real music to relate it to. This is stupid. It's just memorising seemingly random sequences of numbers and letters, and will really put you off progressing. If it's not fun or obviously useful, just set it aside.  On a broader scope, if you can afford lessons, get lessons. Ideally from a teacher who is highly recommended by sources you trust. If you start up with a teacher who isn't really doing it for you, don't hesitate to try to let them know that you would prefer a different approach or track. If they can't or won't accommodate you, or you can't bear to confront them or are unable to articulate what the issue is, just move on. Make up some excuse if you have to, but don't drag it out. A good teacher wants to see their students enjoying and progressing in their playing.  If you can't afford or access a teacher, you can still do well on your own with youtube vids etc, you'll just need to be extra self-critical and aware of what you are doing, because the guy from justinguitar.com isn't going to tell that your barre chords aren't working because you're slouching too much etc. But [actually this is really important so it gets its  own paragraph] ...  Please get your instrument/s checked out by a qualified repairer, or at least someone who knows their shit about guitars. If your instrument is poorly set up (chances are 50/50 that it is, even if it's a new, expensive brand name guitar) it will negatively affect your technical development! Likely the repairer will tell you something like your action is too high and/or your truss rod needs adjusting. These are not hugely technical tasks, if you are light for cash just google how to do this stuff and have a shot yourself. Otherwise, let the repairer do his/her thing. A full setup will run you upwards of $100 (this is Australian prices), possibly well upwards, but is highly recommended for the future of your technique and enjoyment! If you can spare the cash, do it.  ~~~  Alright, so all that said, my advice for your progression from here would be something like this:   Bust down any chord progressions you know into just their root notes. If you think of a chord as a mini-tune with all the notes played at once, the root is basically the key of the chord. The root is usually the lowest pitched note you play in a guitar chord, but it's quite common for this not to be the case, so be careful! If you aren't certain, google for an interval breakdown of the chord. Since you are messing with bass, this is especially fundamental. The most basic bass lines simply play the root notes of the chords. Learn how to count distances between notes. On single string this is simple; how many frets do you move from one note to the next? If the next note you play is 3 frets up the neck (higher as in pitch; towards the body of the guitar), the distance in pitch is 3 semitones. Any time you play a root note and then another notes a set number of semitones away, you are creating a harmony which is common to any two notes that distance away. Experiment by finding intervals (distances in pitch) that sound cool to you, internalising what mood the interval stirs in you (is it happy or sad? noisy or neutral? bright or dark?), and playing the same interval in different keys (move both notes the same distance up or down in pitch). Does it sound like a song you know? Learn to count distances in pitch between different strings. This is dictated by the tuning of the guitar. You know how (mostly) you tune any string to the note at the fifth fret of the next string lower in pitch? This means that any two notes on the same fret of two adjacent strings are five semitones apart. How about if you raise the higher pitched note by two semitones (move up two frets) but keep the lower one as-is? The distance is now 5+2 = 7. What about if you stay on the same fret but skip a string? Then the notes you are playing are 5+5 = 10 semitones apart. What about if you move the lower note down? What about playing two notes at the same fret on the G and B strings, which are tuned differently? You get the idea. Then get to know concept of the most fundamental interval; the octave. 12 semitones. The same note, different pitch. How does that work? If I am in the key of G and I start on one particular G but finish on a different G, does the tune still resolve? Then learn the major scale. Start at a root note, travel upwards through a set sequence of intervals (google it), until you land at the root note an octave up. If you are into rock styles, your main interest in this will be how a major chord is built from the notes therein, and how to flesh out your bass lines using these chord tones. Your next interest in this scale is that every single musical harmony is described in terms of the major scale intervals. If someone just says ""a third"" without context (beyond that of music), they mean the interval created by playing the first note and the third note of a major scale. If they say ""a [something other than major] third"" they are almost certainly talking about something else, but the [something other than] describes how the interval compares to its counterpart in the major scale. Without a working knowledge of the major scale, your ability to communicate with other musicians will be severely restricted.   By the time you get really familiar with all that, you have a solid foundation on which to learn to use different scales, transpose tunes, build chords, learn how diatonic chord systems work, relative minor, modes, non-diatonic stuff, altered chords, blah blah blah. But yeah, plenty of time for that later. Make sure you know all the stuff in the bullet points first.  This turned into quite the wall of text, hope some of it's helpful :)"

I know their is a huge following of weight loss on instagram, but  not sure where this would gain a following. If you choose to instead make some sort of educational posting regarding various techniques and music theory as you learn about them, then they will be better cemented in your memory. One of the best ways to learn is by teaching. Now being that you say you are between beginner and intermediate, I would focus more on techniques to begin with, and slowly incorporate more music theory as this project goes on."
guitarlessons,3arq9s,DeLaMuerta,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:10:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess I don't really intend to make use of instagram, my focus would be more on making a weekly video and maybe a blog in time.  I'm at a point in my learning where I know bits and pieces of many songs, several scales (though my ability to apply them is nil), all of the open chords, barre chords -- E and A forms, some inversions, and triads -- I'm sure there's more but that is a good idea of where I'm at.  Not sure I'm really ready to start on this yet, but I'm just trying to get a feel for it and start getting some ideas together."
guitarlessons,3arq9s,DeLaMuerta,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:52:48 2015 UTC,"So, at least in my opinion I see this working as either blog format, or video format. I know you said you were familiar with chords so, just as an example, if you wanted to strengthen your knowledge of chords you could do a posting about the CAGED system. You could also, if you wanted to go more than just surface depth into that, talk about how the D in CAGED is redundant. You could also do a lesson on hendrixian chord form and utilizing your pinky to link together rhythm and lead passages. Another good place to start may be right handed tecniques (i.e. palm muting, strum patterns in time, alternate picking, tremolo picking, raking etc. etc.) The same goes with with left handed techniques if you feel those need practice. An important piece in these postings is to integrate them musically, so if you did a post about hammer ons, pull offs and slides; make sure to find a riff or passage that uses those techniques so that you have the opportunity to practice them musically as well as technique wise."
guitarlessons,3arq9s,SifikaLoL,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:01:08 2015 UTC,"Good ideas for sure.  I want it to be less of a lesson and more of a video to go over what I'm working on, how it's going, and maybe show some of the results.  I feel like there are many lessons out there already and I'm sure they're better than what I can churn out.  Also, I use a lot of these lesson resources for my own practice, so I could share any resources I felt particularly useful in my learning process."

OK here are a few thoughts in the spirit of being constructive & all that:  Since this is about a visual method for helping you remember scale shapes, I think images would really help in getting the idea across.   You should probably say something about that fret shift that sometimes happens between the different string pairs and sometimes doesn't.  I wouldn't give the hexachords the same names as the modes. That seems to mix up two slightly different things.  Explain the purpose of this idea up-front. Is the student supposed to use it as a handy memory aid or a complete ""system""? What should they know beforehand? By what steps do they build from the system you laid out to fluency with the modes all over the fretboard?"

guitarlessons,3afd2t,chappersyo,2,Sat Jun 20 00:45:19 2015 UTC,He's my favorite. There are a lot of great tutorials. Most of them if they go on very long I just want them to hurry and get to the meat so I can see if I will be like the way they are presenting whatever it is. This fellow I know I will love it every time. Give him money. I need more of his videos. I gave him some but I am not made of lots of money :o. I just retired a year ago and am finally having lots of time to spend on my guitar.

guitarlessons,3aeo9g,Jezzikial,3,Fri Jun 19 15:05:23 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with this guy. If you've only just started playing, and have no real grasp on music theory, there's no need to learn the notes on the fretboard. That information will be completely useless to you at this point.  But if you want to really learn guitar, and understand what you are doing, go for it. But just knowing the notes on the fretboard without any context is useless, so you'll need to learn some basic theory on the side."
guitarlessons,3aeo9g,KingCalsium,5,Fri Jun 19 15:13:08 2015 UTC,"Where is the best place to start learning music theory, as well as notes?"
guitarlessons,3aeo9g,heart_of_kezia,3,Fri Jun 19 16:45:46 2015 UTC,"I have to admit that I learned music theory in school, so I don't know exactly where to look, and which resources to use, but you could try looking over the sidebars of  /r/musictheory and this subreddits FAQ. I Also found this dummy site. This video I found in the FAQ, which you should check out, seems to be a nice introduction."

guitarlessons,3aeo9g,vx1,6,Fri Jun 19 20:01:32 2015 UTC,"Someone explained how easy it was to learn the fretboard (if I could recall the person, I'd credit them).  You probably already know more half the notes on the fretboard.    If you know that first three frets then you also know the 4 frets starting at the 12th (12-15) fret since they repeat nut - 3rd fret.  You also know the 4th fret and the 16th (think about it). You also know the 11th fret You know the 5th fret if you try tuning by ear   You know 11 fret positions out of 17 without breaking a sweat. that leaves 6-10. Not bad."
guitarlessons,3aeo9g,beef-o-lipso,11,Fri Jun 19 16:50:44 2015 UTC,Yes
guitarlessons,3aeo9g,beef-o-lipso,4,Fri Jun 19 14:48:46 2015 UTC,"I would say yes, but you can do it as you go along.   I am a very capable guitarist, and I could find you the name of any note on the fretboard, but I don't know them ALL instinctively and intuitively. And neither does Joe Pass I believe since in one of his videos, you can see him trying to figure out what the 4 different possible roots of a dim7 are, by sliding the shape up and down, instead of just looking at what they are.   You'll want to know your CAGED chords, and how to find all of those, especially those rooted on the E an A string, but once you learn, your E chord, and the other E chords you can play, you will know those roots of E, and you can learn the important ones that way.   You will hear all sorts of opinions on this, from all sorts of different levels of talent and skill."
guitarlessons,3aeo9g,Akoustyk,4,Fri Jun 19 15:24:00 2015 UTC,"It is not a hard thing to do.  The most useful way to do it is to first learn the notes of the sixth string and fifth string.  This will give you the root notes of most chords and scale patterns.  After you've memorized these two strings, the 1st string is the same as the sixth, so you've got half the fretboard memorized already.  Once you understand how to find the octave interval, the D string and G string come easily.  tl;dr It's not that difficult and the payoff is huge."
guitarlessons,3aeo9g,808strafe,2,Fri Jun 19 17:03:11 2015 UTC,"It never hurts... but it greatly depend on what you want to do, what is your current goal with the guitar. I've been playing for about 15 years and since my goal has been to play for me when I'm bored, for my friends and just basically messing around, for the first few years I didn't bother with the notes or any formal music theory. A few years later I learned a little, just enough to get over some hurdles and have really not bothered much with it. (it helps I had some musical formation during high school)  If you want to truly be a musician, then yes, some music theory will be needed, it will be the necessary foundation to make you reach new levels... just don't obsess with it and never forget to above all have fun while playing."
guitarlessons,3aeo9g,cesclaveria,2,Fri Jun 19 17:33:53 2015 UTC,"This is my method of learning both intervals and the notes on the Fretboard.   http://www.sevenstring.org/forum/3067730-post6.html  Not to offend you, I'm not sure what you skill level you're at.  My post was aimed at single note playing and more for the intermediate players. However you can still use it.    For example. If you learn intervals and notes are on the guitar. You wouldn't need a chord chart. You could even make up your own chord voicings.   So if someone tells you to play a Am9 you would know where ACEGB are on the fretboard. But in that case you'd need to know diatonic theory and how chords are built.   Again it's hard to give advice not knowing your skill level.   I wouldn't worry too much of knowing where the notes are for right now and just learn as many practical chords at the moment. Get more familiar with the guitar. Instead of playing just open chords work on bar chords. Try learning at least 3 different positions for every chord you know.   If you're interested in song writing. Learn how intervals work on the guitar. The notes will come much easier. After that, you're ready for building chords in Diatonic theory and then Voice leading.   If you're just wanting to play along with someone or learn some songs. Just learn as many chords you can and don't worry about where all the notes are."
guitarlessons,3aeo9g,Phrygian12,2,Fri Jun 19 21:44:40 2015 UTC,"My wife sang country music and played guitar. She capo'd her guitar to change keys and she basically new 5 or 10 chords. She knew when the 1/4/5 chords were coming and how to change to them. That was it. With that, you could play a lot of country/campfire music. Furthermore, if you have a really good memory, you could play a lot of music for a lot of people.   If you want to get into music as a language, you really have to learn the notes, the theory (starting with the circle of 5ths and basic scales) and chord construction. It's not as hard as it sounds."
guitarlessons,3aeins,keyremote,3,Fri Jun 19 13:55:04 2015 UTC,"Yes. The way the neck is organized in standard tuning, E A D G B E, if you barre a chord, you are essentially moving the nut.  An A chord is A, C#, and E. When do you make that shape at the open position, you get A D A C# E  Barre an E shape at the 5th fret, you get A E A C# E A -- all the notes of the A chord but at the 5th fret.  This works for all moveable chord shapes.   There are a ton of chord generators on line. Find one that makes sense for you and check it out."
guitarlessons,3aeins,beef-o-lipso,2,Fri Jun 19 14:12:01 2015 UTC,"It's like this ...  Play an open E chord like this.  Now, put a capo across the first fret.  Now play that same E chord below the capo (since the capo is on the first fret, you're playing the E chord one fret further away from the top of the guitar than before).  That E chord shape is now producing the sound of on F chord.  Move the capo to fret 2, do the same.  That E chord shape is now producing the sound of an F# chord.  Move the capo to fret 3, do the same.  That E chord shape is now producing the sound of an G chord.  So ... when you play barre chords, you are using your pointing finger instead of the capo.  Got it?"
guitarlessons,3aeins,whitejag,2,Fri Jun 19 14:35:19 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot for your replies. What I am struggling with is if you can take an E shape and turn it into any other chord what is the use of having other shapes- could you not just use one shape and create different chords down the neck?
guitarlessons,3aeins,InflationFighter,2,Fri Jun 19 14:47:29 2015 UTC,or would baring the second fret for example turn an open A into an Asharp
guitarlessons,3aeins,seawo1f,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:53:30 2015 UTC,"The different shapes make subtlety different sounds.   Plus, when playing the different shapes, open strings can ring out when you transition to different chords. This can't happen with barre chords.  Try playing the same chord progression with open chords, then barre chords. Which do you prefer?"
guitarlessons,3aeins,gloryian,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:00:49 2015 UTC,Actually baring the second fret would give you a B chord because you're moving it two semi tones (frets) up from an A chord. To make an A# you would need to slide the A up one fret and barre the first fret. If you take a D barre chord using the 6th string as a root (E shape) it would be be barred at the 10th fret. If you use the 5th string as a root (A shape) then you would barre it at the 5th fret (with the 6th string muted otherwise it's a D/E chord) although these are both D chords they do sound a bit different.
guitarlessons,3aeins,MrPGH,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:28:38 2015 UTC,"Well, that shape is only for one chord type - major chords. There are many other chord types - minor, diminished, dominant 7th, etc., that are played using different shapes, most of which are also moveable like the one you mentioned. Also, there's a slight difference in sound between different shapes of the same chord. The way the chord is voiced (the ordering of the notes in a chord) has an effect on the overall sound of the chord."
guitarlessons,3aeins,seawo1f,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:24:56 2015 UTC,"What really illustrated the need for different voicings for me was playing Hendrix stuff.  For example, ""Hey Joe"" uses C G D A and E as its chord progression throughout the song.  Try playing those chords in an open position.  THEN listen to Hendrix play them at the 3, 5 and 7th frets as he inverts them.  World of difference on the feel of the song."
guitarlessons,3aeins,krunnky,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:26:09 2015 UTC,The way I learned was by looking at this http://www.justinguitar.com/images/TB_images/NoteCircle.gif if you take an E chord (any E chord) and move it up one semi tone (one fret) then it will give you an F chord. One more will give you an F# chord. Same with A shapes although you will have to mute the low E string for those barre chords.
guitarlessons,3aeins,blok31092,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:10:05 2015 UTC,"It works for any chord, provided you have enough fingers to bar the root fret.  An open Gmajor chord is tough to Barre, but it is used by many guitarist.  http://www.justinguitar.com/images/CH_images/Chord-CG-Maj.gif  The root in this case is the note being played on the Low-E string. If you make your root the 5th fret, that's an A Major Chord.  Move the same chord up to fret 8, and you're playing a C Major.  A pretty neat concept, the CAGED system: http://www.londonguitaracademy.com/wp-content/uploads/the_c_a_g_e_d_system.jpg  use the chord patterns for C A G E, and D anywhere and learn how they are relative and you can pretty much transpose any song ever.  A vital skill for a cover band or a studio musician."

guitarlessons,3a6v3b,hokieseas,3,Thu Jun 18 11:34:10 2015 UTC,"Learn your 12 bar blues and practice your pentatonic scales over it. For example, look up a youtube video for ""Blues Jam Track in Am"" and then play the Am Pentatonic Scale improvised over the jam track. Great way to practice your stuff while staying in time. Blues is all about the interval of the notes, which is generally I-IV-V with some 7ths thrown in. For A this would basically be A D E (as if you're counting ABC etc.) If you're totally new don't worry about that too much...just listen to blues and develop an ear for when the transitions happen and do your thing.  As far as a full song... I recommend ""First Day of My Life"" from Bright Eyes. Really lovely song with simple chords save for a few slightly tricky chords in the chorus that are great to learn and they sound pretty."

guitarlessons,3a6qnd,gettingthedoubled,3,Wed Jun 17 17:43:40 2015 UTC,So I can't for the life of me palm mute every other note. Song name is What a Horrible Night to Have a Curse. Does anyone have insight on the optimal way to pull this off? Feels so awkward and not right.
guitarlessons,3a6qnd,iamthewinnar,4,Wed Jun 17 17:45:38 2015 UTC,Start at a slower tempo till you start building some muscle memory. Then start increasing speed. And practice!
guitarlessons,3a6qnd,antinomadic,3,Wed Jun 17 18:00:06 2015 UTC,"There's no way that is all down strokes. At the speed of the song, it's just not practical, even though it may be possible.  The way I'm doing it is starting the riff with an up stroke. On the palm muted notes it's blend of muting with your palm and a down stroke. That means for the upstroke your hand/palm has to come off the strings a bit, hovering over them, and then your hand comes down, silencing the upstroked note, and down picking the palm muted note at the same time, in one motion.   If this method isn't easy right off bat, practice it a bit, slowly, because I'm sure this is how it's supposed to be played. I'm noticing it's a bit easier to get the motion when you're playing on two adjacent strings like in that tab, bar 50.  Just remember that tabs aren't always correct, or set in stone. It's kind of hard to hear in the song if they are actually palm muting every other note, but if they are, this is how you do it.  If have any questions about my suggestion, feel free to reply or send me a PM.  Also, thanks for reminding me that I need to listen to this album again. It's been a while."
guitarlessons,3a6qnd,awesomebolt,2,Thu Jun 18 14:03:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed reply. I will likely hit you up on pm from time to time. I like what you said about tabs not being correct all the time. I am going to try and practice how you said to approach it with the upstroke start. I don't know how much effort I will apply to this in the end. I have only seen palm muting on a string above where notes are mostly being played. Tuned to C it feels like there is no point in palm muting. That solo is going to be a beast.  Anyway, you are right about this album being really great. I started listening to BDM during ritual and rarely get into previous albums. Every song is so well done and doesn't feel made to pad an albums song list."
guitarlessons,3a6qnd,CutMeSomeSlackJack,3,Thu Jun 18 20:15:21 2015 UTC,"My guess is that all the notes are downpicked and you simply alternate palm muting at the bridge. That might be hard if you can't downpick fast enough, but practicing it will get you there."

guitarlessons,3a6qnd,CutMeSomeSlackJack,3,Wed Jun 17 18:00:05 2015 UTC,"It says palm mute. Like someone else said, it's most likely rapid down picking with your palm bouncing in and off the strings at the bridge. Super slow, then work up. As soon as you start making  mistakes, slow down."

guitarlessons,3a73c0,2Heismans,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:35:39 2015 UTC,"Same. I hold the pick with both my index finger and middle finger.  With considerable effort I think I would be able to change it to just the index. I seem to recall Paul Gilbert says he holds it like that while playing chords/rhythm.  But I kind of like how I hold it. It feels natural, but that's probably because I'm so used to it. I feel like it might make my playing a little sloppy, but I don't really see any significant drawbacks (I'm not a shredder so my solos don't require anything crazy... but I was able to sweep when I learnt to a while ago, so I don't think it's been bad).  If it doesn't affect you in a bad way, then it's just one of those different ways of doing things (like Brian May and a coin pick, etc)/"
guitarlessons,3a73c0,Simsimius,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:03:55 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day it's all about your end game. what do you want to play/sound like… I think that good technique is crucial and the way you grip the pick plays a role in this on many levels.  I never held a pick that way so I don't know what is or isn't possible using your grip but I will say that if you intend to bring your playing to the highest level and become a world class player you will be the first I've seen using that grip.   I don't mean that sarcastically. Sometimes the odd ways we do things define our style. Sometimes they are just bad habits and it's hard to know when to try something new.  Cheers,  Dani"

guitarlessons,3a5g9f,drewbydewbydoo,7,Wed Jun 17 11:14:40 2015 UTC,"Have a look at where your thumb is on the back of the neck.  To play this song, you need to have your thumb about halfway down and pointing slightly towards the head of the guitar. This enables your fingers to naturally take a fret each - if you don't fret anything, your fingers will each line up perfectly with a particular fret giving you a 4 fret reach quite comfortably. If your thumb is anywhere near the top of the neck it makes it much more difficult."

Had to read it a second time before I actually saw it was Crash and had forgotten how I had to work on making the higher strings ring on that one.  In general, I've found that many of Dave's songs allow you to work on techniques and form that can be extremely useful elsewhere."
guitarlessons,3a5g9f,JeremyCasey,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:40:52 2015 UTC,"It's something that gets better over time, but I've found with this particular song you can get away with playing the open the B string.  The color is a little different but it still sounds good IMO."
guitarlessons,3a5g9f,agemolotta,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:17:36 2015 UTC,"just play a C#m7 instead and you wont have to stretch. it sounds the same. after I did this for a while, it became easy to play the note with my pinky if i wanted to. it might be the same for you. but it really doesnt sound different because you are getting the E note in so many different places anyway.   0-4-2-4-0-0"
guitarlessons,3a5g9f,Bananafrosted,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:43:40 2015 UTC,"My experience with playing Dave Matthews songs really just boils down to practice...  I don't have a guitar in front of me to confirm this for Crash - but in a great number of his songs you're constantly moving the angle of your wrist and thumb (though your hand stays pretty stationary as far as moving up/down the neck is concerned) to compensate for some of the ridiculous chord shapes. I kind of accidentally figured this out somewhere along the line, and if you watch him play live, you'll also notice that he does it too.   There's also a couple different ways of playing the song ranging from ""close enough because the other way is hurting the entire left side of my body"" to ""the way that Dave plays it, inexplicably, for 7 or 8 minutes at a time.""  E.g., maybe this will make a little sense: during the big stretch (index finger on the second fret of the D string and also barring the second fret of the A string, ring and pinky holding on the 4th and 5th fret of G and B) the inside of the wrist is angled sharply, dipping below the high E string. Next position is the middle finger fretting the fourth fret of the A string, and to compensate, the wrist angle is completely open, and trying to rise above the low E string. This is where you can ""get away"" with taking your index finger off of the 2nd fret of the D string and muting it until the next go around.   Dave will keep the 2nd fret of the D, along with the 4th and 5th fret of G and B fretted pretty much the entire time - which is rather difficult, and is just boils down to practice and flexibility."
guitarlessons,3a5g9f,KiwiSnugfoot,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:35:00 2015 UTC,"Crash is a particularly tough DMB song to play so don't get frustrated. I've been playing their songs for years and that one still makes my hand sore, right under my thumb. I don't know how Dave does it night after night.   Learn Satellite, as /r/beef-o-lipso said, or #34, and Pantala Naga Pampa.   But really, it is as simple as practice. If you're not practicing that song to stretch your fingers, you're practicing another. So one way or the other, practice."

guitarlessons,39uc5n,Luvod,5,Sun Jun 14 21:11:08 2015 UTC,"In addition to learning scales, the other important thing to understand is phrasing. A string of notes is often phrased using notes in the scale, and the phrase will typically resolve on it near your root note. Depending on timing and how you structure your phrase you can temporarily end on another note, and return to the root in your next phrase. This is how riffs and solos are built. The best places to get phrases from when you are just starting out are your favorite solos and songs, work these into your own melodies and solos over backing tracks. As time progresses get more adventurous and try new things."
guitarlessons,39uc5n,DeLaMuerta,2,Sun Jun 14 22:50:38 2015 UTC,I'm having a bit of trouble understanding what this means - can you give an example?  Edit: Thanks for the comments. :)
guitarlessons,39uc5n,whtrbt,3,Sun Jun 14 23:51:57 2015 UTC,"I think what he's saying is that when you learn scales and so forth, you're sort of learning the alphabet of music.  The alphabet by itself doesn't say much, you have to go further and learn words and phrases.    Different musical genres are like different languages, each has its own typical riffs and sequences.  You can put those phrases together to make larger ideas.    Once you have a phrase you like, I think a good thing to do with it is play it, then repeat it, and keep repeating it but also keep changing it as you go.  If you're playing over chords change it to sound good over each new chord as it comes up.  Play it forward and backward, transpose it, play it faster or slower, etc.  In a solo you can take a phrase and play around with it like this, and it tells a sort of 'story of the phrase'."
guitarlessons,39uc5n,Bzzt,2,Mon Jun 15 02:21:55 2015 UTC,"I'm on mobile, so I'll try my best. The best example of this I can think of is the common blues motif using the pentatonic on the top three strings, and it loops back into itself. It sounds like the first piece of the solo to Mr. Crowley by Ozzy. This is an example of a phrase."
guitarlessons,39uc5n,DeLaMuerta,2,Mon Jun 15 00:09:19 2015 UTC,"Basically learn some cool licks that you like. You don't need to learn what they 'mean.' Just learn them. Once you learn different scales and where and when you can use them, you can begin to experiment with them to make your own."
guitarlessons,39uc5n,hungry_lobster,3,Tue Jun 23 02:57:39 2015 UTC,"I am one of those players that doesn't recommend using licks from other players. I mean, it's ok to do it, but if you want to play spontaneously, then I don't think that's going through a library of licks you've learned.   I also don't think the traditional concept, of scales, the way people think of scales at first, is a very good approach either. You will want to learn some scales, but also how they work, and once you do, you realize that there is actually nearly no information of what to play at all.   They just categorize groups of notes into sounds. They make it easier to find the notes you want. It is not the notes you should want. You can always play all of the notes, but you'll want to play some in some ways, and others in others, and scales are separating one sort of notes from another set, in given context.   If you learn licks and scales as sort of collections of notes to choose from, then theory will decide stuff for you, your music will be bland, and it will sound like a lot of other guys. It won't sound fresh and unique, which is, in a way, what improvisation is all about.   So, really, obviously you should learn some theory, but what you want is to think in terms of sounds, and learn how to make those into music on guitar. Knowing theory will help you do this.   So, play slow, think of what you want, and then play it, and then look at what that is from a theory standpoint. This way you will be able to learn to play virtually anything you can think of.   If you can improvise solos in your mind, without your guitar, then all you want to do is be able to play anything that you think of, almost at least, on your guitar.   If you can't really improvise in your mind without your guitar, then all you can do is try to use theory to help you choose what to play.   Another thing I'll add is that rhythm and phrasing are the most important things. It is not how fast you can play, or how many scales or which scales you chose to use. Not whether you play root notes 40% of the time, and start licks on this note, or that note, not anything theory like that. Just like if I speak to you, what is important in what I'm saying, is not what sort of word I used to start my sentence, nor how many adjectives I used, nor how big or complicated the words I used are. What matters is specifically the intent, specifically the meaning that is create by the words I put together.   Music is that way. It's not any one single thing you can point at, you can't use some set of theory to dictate how to build great solos. It doesn't exist. A great solo is intent to create a certain phrasing which is a marriage of timing and pitch over a background music, and what matters, the only thing that matters, is what it sounds like. So, what it sounds like is what you should be using to decide how to make it sound. Right? Not how many this or that, not what notes to play during what chord, not anything mathematical, but the experience of the sound.   The theory will help you find that on your fretboard.   Learning music is not learning to create music, really. It is learning how to release the music that already exists.   That's what it is to me, at any rate. You might prefer a different approach."

(I use a winter scarf, and yes, I look completely stupid.)  Being blindfolded does force you to listen rather than think so much. The scales are handy to have as tools, but not being able to see can force you out of just playing the right notes into a more creative/musical place."

guitarlessons,39t9k3,qwertyujop,7,Sun Jun 14 15:39:29 2015 UTC,"My advice involves some kind of air guitar, but more focused on developing dexterity. We'll focus on your fretting hand. You'll be using your thumb as an imaginary fret. With this exercises you will be capable of moving your fingers in any -fretting- pattern you want.   In the first exercise you have your hand positioned as if you were holding a glass from the bottom, with all your fingers upwards. Move your index to your thumb (not the other way around, your thumb to the index). Move you middle to the thumb and, at the same time, take the index out. Repeat for the ring and pinky. I'll give numbers to each finger to keep things more brief: index - 1, middle - 2, ring - 3, pinky - 4. So, in this first exercise you will be doing 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 sequences over and over. Repeat until you can do it fast enough without bumping your fingers with each other. Second exercise: 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 over and over. Third exercise: 1 - 3 - 2 - 4 over and over. You get the idea, make any combination you can imagine. They can go beyond four taps: 1 - 2 - 4 - 3 - 4 - 2 - 3 - 1- 2- 1, for example.     To build strength I recommend using those foam balls people use for stress. Squeeze the ball and pair up with hand stretches."

guitarlessons,39rlwa,sidi1625,19,Sun Jun 14 02:02:35 2015 UTC,"To figure out strum pattern all by yourself you have to develop your rhythmic sense, since music happens over time. I'll help you channelize your inner percussionist and teach you how to count up to 4 in several ways.    What is rhythm?  Sounds have different durations and are separated of each other in certain ways. This property is called rhythm. Here's an excellent Ted-Ed video on visualizing rhythms & beats.    How to figure out rhythms   The 4/4 time signature is very common in western music. It basically is four beats of quarter notes. Let's count: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 . . . Each beat has the same duration.  Let's apply this to the real world. Go to your preferred audio streaming program/app/website and play any song you want. Listen carefully to it. You may feel an underlying beat. 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 . . . Tap your feet to this beat. Keep listening. You may notice that there is more happening.  With your hands try to hit your knee -from the leg that is tapping to the underlying beat- to the extra beats. At first you will find this difficult but it gets easier.   Some songs to exercise (you can move to the next song when you feel you have the rhythm of the current song). I'll cover lots of genres, just to develop your rhythmic sense: pop ballad, upbeat rock, grunge, pop, R&B, funk, swing, cumbia, salsa, surf, rocknroll . . .  With some practice you will be able to figure out within seconds the rhythm of any song you listen to. Keep practicing!    Moving rhythm to guitar  Strumming involves two movements, downwards and upwards. Let's mix time signatures and strummin direction. The simplest way is one quarter beats with only downward strums. Practice your strumming patterns while muting the strings with your fretting hand.    1   2   3   4   1   2   3   4 |-▼---▼---▼---▼-|-▼---▼---▼---▼-|   Practice this strumming pattern until you don't miss for a whole minute. I totally recommend timing your practice. When you're done move to the next strumming pattern.  Quarter notes and only downward strums aren't very vibrant. If we try a faster note duration, eight notes, maybe things will change. In a 4/4 time, you can stack eight beats of eight notes. To count with eighth notes you add a ""&"" between numbers. You will also add upward strums at every ""&"":    1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &   1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & |-▼-▲-▼-▲-▼-▲-▼-▲-|-▼-▲-▼-▲-▼-▲-▼-▲-|   You can notice immediately how it changes the feeling of the rhythm.  To move on let's try some combinations with quarter and eighth notes! How about: Quarter, eighth, eighth, quarter, eighth, eighth? Remember, 1 quarter note = 2 eighth notes.    1   2 & 3   4 &   1   2 & 3   4 &  |-▼---▼-▲-▼---▼-▲-|-▼---▼-▲-▼---▼-▲-|   Now try: Eighth, eighth, quarter, eighth, eighth, quarter. Remember: Numbers are downwards, &'s are upwards.    1 & 2   3 & 4     1 & 2   3 & 4    |-▼-▲-▼---▼-▲-▼---|-▼-▲-▼---▼-▲-▼---|   Create any rhythm you want using only quarter and eight notes. For now, keep inside a 4/4 framework.    Note duration  In music we have different note durations:  Slow.   Whole: 4 beats (a full 4/4 measure). Half: 2 beats. 1 whole = 2 halves.   Most common and versatile.   Quarter: 1 beat. 1 half = 2 quarters. Eighth: 1/2 beat. 1 quarter = 2 eighths. Sixteenth: 1/4 beat. 1 eighth = 2 sixteenths.   So fast they aren't common at all.   32th: 1/8 beat. 1 sixteenth = 2 32ths. 64th: 1/16 beat. 1 32th = 2 64ths.   Create new rhythms using durations from whole to sixteenth. To stack 16th notes you count like this: 1 & & & 2 & & & 3 & & & 4 & & &  For example:    1       2       3   &   4 & & & |-▼-------▼-------▼---▲---▼-▲-▼-▲-|   Write lots of rhythms, focus on accentuating either the 1 and 3 or the 2 and 4 beats. Remember: Mute your strings while you practice, numbers are downwards, &s are upwards.    Emulating a drum set  Finally, you can subdivide the strings of your guitar: Lower three and higher three. Try what Paul Gilbert shows at the beginning of this video -ignore the rest, I just wanted to show you how to subdivide. Couple your rhythms with the subdivision of strings and voila! Now you have all the skills required to strum any song you want!  Keep on rockin'!"

guitarlessons,39qeks,poobafan,6,Sat Jun 13 19:10:22 2015 UTC,"You're playing G,B,C,D and F which are respectively the root, major third, fourth (or 11), fifth and flat seven over G. I would probably think of this just as part of the mixolydian mode, as the flat seven, major third and 11 all point to that sound and you're really just missing the 9 (A) and the 6 (E). However, I have a feeling that you're hearing this as more of a variation on G minor Pentatonic. The notes in G minor Pentatonic are G,Bb,C,D and F. Technically this doesn't make sense to play over G major due to the minor third and perfect fourth, but in the blues that would not be uncommon and is even part of what makes the blues sound ""bluesy"". So even though the notes you're playing strongly indicate the mixolydian mode, I'd say it's the closeness the G minor Pentatonic that you're hearing, and the substitution of the major third for the minor third that makes it seem new or different."

Go on YouTube and search for backing tracks in the key you picked and play around with the scale over it.   Repeat ad nauseum. When you get tired of it, pick a new key and start over.   Best way to learn scales (or anything on guitar) is to use them.

guitarlessons,39iaxg,LivinTheMomentMusic,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:23:54 2015 UTC,"thought it was a really pretentious and crappy lesson  who's to say how people play chords, and what fingers they are comfortable playing those chords with? why would you want to limit knowledge of guitar chords to simple shapes that YOU tell people to use. Even going a step further by telling people what fingers to use. in my experience this kind of teaching severely discourages guitar playing and knowledge"

guitarlessons,396cej,chizmack,2,Tue Jun 9 22:40:58 2015 UTC,"It is not limiting, it is liberating. It is another way to see the major scale, and it can help you play over a chord in the but portion of the neck, and then play up higher and arpeggiate or play the chord up higher also.   The people that say it is limiting are not very good at guitar, imo. Just people that aren't that good, that for some reason think they know what's important to get miles ahead from where they are.

I find the G shape pretty pointless. And the C and D shape, I consider as just one shape. So, for me, every major and minor chord has 3 main shapes. A low, a med and a high. Once you get to certain extensions though, you sometimes need to drop some.  Its not supposed to be a single system you use, its supposed to be just one part of the shit you know. Just one thing."
guitarlessons,396cej,MiguelMarquezMusic,2,Wed Jun 10 02:49:47 2015 UTC,"Yes it doesn't have to be the only way to learn chords, plus you'll use some shapes a lot more than others. It's great for linking together scales + arpeggios as well."

guitarlessons,395tse,RainbowGoddamnDash,2,Tue Jun 9 18:05:18 2015 UTC,"I posted this response a year ago when someone else asked about pinch harmonics. Hopefully it will help you out.    Think of it like this. You have a string, when played opened it plays the note it's tuned to and vibrates the whole string.       nut                         bridge        -----------------------------  &lt;- Full string   Now if you divide the length of that string by half, the halfway point is called the node.   nut                         string  -------------x--------------- &lt;- string divided in half, X is node.    When you play that note while having your finger on that halfway point node, you'll get a natural harmonic. The best way to hear this is by placing your finger on the 12th fret and don't press down. Harmonics work best when you divide the string evenly, which is why the 5th fret harmonic (1/4 of the string),        5th  nut  fret                  bridge  ------x------x------x------   the 7th(1/3 of the string) works.          7th nut     fret              bridge --------x--------x---------   This is the basics of it really, there is a lot more info that deals with the overtones of the guitar harmonics and how they work with this. We can also use this same concept for pinch harmonics. The main difference of natural harmonics and pinch harmonics is the base string distance. If you're holding down on a string, you change the value of the original distance.          Open string          23.5 inches -------------------------              9th fret                  Forget this           side             |   9th fret   nut       v    v              13.973 inches    --------------x-----------                        bridge   Just use the same concept as above, but use the string from your finger to the bridge, not the nut to the finger. You will find many pinch harmonics with that."

You can find them with practice also important PRACTICE THEM WITHOUT GAIN."

guitarlessons,395tse,korthrun,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:44:46 2015 UTC,"I want to echo one of the points another commenter made:   Explore with your right hand position at different placements between the bridge and the start of the neck as you pluck the strings. Listen for the harmonic that you want and look where your right hand is.    This is key. You are not going to get the same quality of harmonic on every fret with your right hand in a static position.  I have personally found a soft touch on the string is important for that ""super squeal"". Too much finger meat will dampen things enough to where you get sort of a harmonic/normal blend or just sort of a damped version of the note you're fretting. On that note, I do love the blended sound with a bit of vibrato :D  On the note of vibrato, I wouldn't say that it's super important or a requirement of any sort, but if you check out the video linked by /u/AlterBridgeFan at about 1:51 you can see the way some vibrato really ""purifies"" the sound of the harmonic. Sometimes you want that, sometimes you don't :D"
guitarlessons,395tse,Masterofunlocking1,0,Tue Jun 9 18:38:05 2015 UTC,Make sure to choke the tip of the pick. Have just a small portion of the pick exposed and try to rub the string across your finger when you pick it.
guitarlessons,395tse,danhawkeye,2,Tue Jun 9 14:29:58 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much it, you don't even need a lot of gain, just good deliberate downstrokes with the pick tip and thumb flesh just about even.  But dear god don't be a CC DeVille. I saw Poison live once and he wouldn't cut that shit out, every fifth note was a pinched harmonic. I felt like I was getting stabbed by pins and needles."

guitarlessons,396qt1,drowerd,6,Tue Jun 9 17:35:14 2015 UTC,"I wonder if there is any underlying pattern to build up swiftly triads   A fret is a semitone. In standard tuning, each string is a 4th higher than the preceding string, except the B (second skinniest) which is a major 3rd high than the G (third) string. A 4th = 5 semitones = 5 frets.  So a major 3rd is 4 frets higher on the same string; a 5th is 7 frets higher. The octave is, of course, 12 frets higher.  Taking into the 5 fret difference between one string and the string immediately higher, a major third on the next higher string is one fret lower than the fret you are on ( the 4 semitones of the interval - 5 frets higher string = -1 fret); a 5th is 2 frets higher (7 - 5 = 2). The octave is (12 - 5 - 5 = 2) two frets higher two strings higher.  Play around with that for a day and it'll become second nature."

guitarlessons,396qt1,bonzai2010,3,Wed Jun 10 06:48:20 2015 UTC,"The nice thing with guitar is that you can simply move a pattern or scale up and down the fretboard to transpose it.  The downside is for a given scale or chord, the patterns change as you move up the fretboard.  Check out the so-called CAGED system.    As for getting instant ""I know where I am"" knowledge anywhere on the fretboard, I'm still working on it.  A few approaches I've worked on:   pick a song, for each chord play multiple forms up and down the neck. pick a song, play through its chords at every position on the neck. at one position on the neck, arpeggio through the pentatonic scale for each chord in the song.  So if the song is Gmaj Amin, then alternate between g major pentatonic and a minor pentatonic, without moving to another position on the neck.   Also I wrote a video game for this!  One of these days I'll have to put it out on the net."

Start with the middle through pinky fingers of the barre shape first. Once you have that, try adding in the barred index finger.

Learning should be slow enough to be perfect, even if that means on beat per minute. Music is what you are doing after learning the piece. If you just started doing something, and you are expecting to be good at it, then that would take the marvel out of playing well.     Practice makes permanent, perfect practice makes perfect.      Finding a mentor / tutor would not hurt either... chin up, and keep on."

Do you want to get better? You can go you entire life playing open chords and you'll never run out of songs to play. Everyone who plays barre chords was in the same spot once. No one started playing guitar and thought barre chords were easy. There is no trick to it, no shortcuts, so stop searching. Everyone goes through the same shit and you aren't going to be the exception. Now if you plan on getting better just stop wasting time bitching about how much it sucks and practice them. No, really practice them. Lock yourself in a room so no one will see you cry and play til it burns (thats your weak muscles getting stronger). In a month you'll look back and call your old-self a pussy while you flex your ripped finger muscles in the mirror.  TL;DR: stop being a pussy."

I've been playing for ten+ years now, and let me tell ya, its so worth it. It will take time to get use to the angles and finger placement. Just play to your comfort level. What i can suggest is when you practice barre chords, practice on the higher frets. They're closer to each other. And every day you should move one fret closer to the nut. That should help out. There is also a handy little tool that you can buy that looks like a trumpet to strengthen your fingers. here it is i hope this helps man. Keep on pickin'!"
guitarlessons,394xrz,killerj95,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:55:29 2015 UTC,"It's more about finger/hand placement than pressure (although using enough pressure is also important). Everyone's hand is different, so you have to figure out what works for you. I remember seeing in a book the A-shape barre chords where you use your ring finger to barre three strings and bend up to miss the first string, and I thought, that's fricking impossible. I'll never be able to do that. But I was wrong. Now I can do it like I can tie my shoes.   The most important thing is to play the chords every day (several times, with breaks in between, if possible). Just trust that if you do this, even if it seems like you are accomplishing absolutely nothing, your hands and brain are getting used to the activity and it WILL get easier.

guitarlessons,394xrz,MuseCo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:59:10 2015 UTC,Try practicing bar chords higher up on the fret where the frets will be smaller and a bit easier. This is what I did until I got comfortable with them.
guitarlessons,394xrz,dankniss,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:40:15 2015 UTC,"Try curving your index finger when you bar, Frank.  Also keep in mind that when doing the F chord for example, you'll be fretting three strings to start with, with your index, middle and ring fingers.  I think the hardest one for me was that little bitch B string.    Now, while I can fret the F chord properly, I still need to work on chord changes with the fucker.  It's a bitch of a cunt, but then I've heard people say to use barr chord versions of the open chords when switching.  Good luck, spank-boy, you'll get it."
guitarlessons,394xrz,chizmack,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:20:06 2015 UTC,Barre chords are NOT all that important.   Keep trying but realize that they are a minor component of a guitar player's repertoire---unless you are a classical musician.

guitarlessons,38zsvd,over-my-head,21,Tue Jun 9 03:18:11 2015 UTC,"The number 1 bad habit - and it is so big that it dwarfs everything else - is that guitarists do not trust their ears. They do not actively practise it, they do not actively try to develop it.  I'll bet there's experienced guitarists reading this  who spend 30 minutes a day for a month practising a scale box, or spend 2 months learning one solo and 0 minutes a year practising their ear."
guitarlessons,38zsvd,newaccount,6,Mon Jun 8 07:47:13 2015 UTC,How would you suggest to practice the ear ? I thought that it only came with time and experience.
guitarlessons,38zsvd,ozerioss,29,Mon Jun 8 09:00:07 2015 UTC,"Watch this 3 minute video of Bobby McFerrin, and sing along to it.  We are naturally born with an ear that's already pretty good at patterns. Watch the video again, then try to find it on the guitar. It might take an hour, it might take a few days, but you'll get it with a week and then you'll have learnt a major pentatonic scale by ear. That's how easy and how hard it is.  It sounds strange, but it's really, really difficult to actively force yourself to just listen to a note and how it relates to the next one. Is it higher or lower? By how much? Big jump or little jump? It's weird to get into the habit of doing it, but that is the only trick to developing your ear - just listen.  Play one fret to the next. Little jump- Play 3rd fret to 5th fret. Big jump. 5th to 8th. Really big jump.  Listen to your favourite song, focus on the bassline or melody line. What are they doing? Higher or lower, big jump or little jump? Just force yourself to sit and listen to each note to the next and really concentrate on it.  Think up a melody, sing it and record it. Then try to learn it on the guitar.  You just have to actively and deliberately listen to the differences between the notes. It comes over time because we inactively listen to the differences between the notes - you develop a good ear eventually without trying, just because you hear the differences a lot.   You'll suck after an hour. In a week you'll have worked out a few things, you'll see a bit of improvement but know there's a long way to go. Exactly like it is with learning a scale or an F chord. In a month, you'll be getting it right 50% of the time. In a year it will be second nature and you won't even think about it.  The goal of any guitarist should be to think only in terms of the 12 notes and rhythm. All the really good guys don't think about what scale they are in, they hear the music and think of what sound they want to go next to create the feeling they want to create. The only way to get there is to become familiar with the 12 notes, and the only way to do that is to actively listen to them."

guitarlessons,38zsvd,Donguitarguy,4,Mon Jun 8 08:53:53 2015 UTC,"BAD habits? Lets see...  *Playing without tuning your guitar. If you're relatively new to guitar, you're guitar is probably out of tune and you don't know it. Tune it properly and everything will sound better.  *Only playing easy songs. You're not gonna get better if you don't push yourself  *Playing songs that are waaay too hard. Beginners shouldn't start with Master of Puppets; you'll just get discouraged.  *Not experimenting with amp/pedal settings. If you only play with distortion cranked up high you're probably masking a lot of your sloppy mistakes. Mess with settings and try to replicate tones from artists you like. Then try to find a tone you like.  *Limiting yourself to one or two genres. You'll learn a lot more if you experiment with other genres.  *ALWAYS looking up tabs. Tabs are great, but you learn a lot about the fretboard and notes if you try to make your own tabs. It's really not that hard to do. You can slow down songs with Audacity and listen more closely to the notes to figure it out if you need to.  *Not playing with others. You're probably not confident with your playing abilities, but you will grow as a musician if you play with others. The only people who will make fun of your lack of skill are people you shouldn't care about anyways. We're all learning the instrument, and there is no need to put someone down simply because they aren't as far along on the path as you are.  *Only playing electric. I was guilty of this one until about 6 months ago. Electric is awesome, but acoustic really strengthens your fingers. I only played my acoustic for a whole month, and when I went back to my electric my bends and hammer-ons/pull-offs were much cleaner. Plus acoustic is pretty damn fun to play.  *Being too tense while playing. Playing should be really relaxed. If you're all tensed up you're playing will suffer. My advice is to play extremely slow, like slow motion slow, and pay attention to how you're forming chords and playing. Try to minimalize your movements as much as possible. Work smarter not harder."
guitarlessons,38zsvd,CurtleTock,12,Tue Jun 9 00:07:39 2015 UTC,"Guitar teacher here, I'd say learn to play what you love first and foremost. Find a good teacher, not some lazy pothead who wants to get paid to jam with people. Ask around, reputations speak for themselves.   Learn the basics of terminology and music theory, but don't EVER feel like you must study everything and reach a certain level of book smarts to be ""good"". SRV couldn't read a note, and Hendrix didn't start playing seriously till he was 15, and by 21 he was considered to be better than Clapton, BY Clapton! Learn enough to start functioning in the music world and communicate to other musicians. Also so you can learn new things faster in the future.   Get involved with other musicians in any way you can, jam sessions, open-mics, church worship, festivals...anything, always surround yourself with people better than you and learn as much as you can. Don't EVER be the best musician you know."

It's like the rules to a board game, it's a concept that seems difficult, but it all links together in a pattern that makes a lot of sense. Record yourself and listen back. How do you sound? Always be in tune. If you're playing metal or hard rock, play your shit with your gain at 6 the most. Beginners usually crank their gain to 10. When you bend a note in a lead, don't just bend it, your brain is either trying to slightly warp it into a blues note or its trying to bend it to the next note in the scale. Those are very common habits. Just keep playing, eventually your fretboard will unlock into whatever key and mood you want to play in."

guitarlessons,38vuw0,Musk-n-Moss,2,Sun Jun 7 07:00:25 2015 UTC,"Learn a lot of songs, and play them the whole way through. Look at how the theory you know is used to make the sounds you like. You will naturally like some sounds over others, learn how those sounds are made.  Learn diatonic theory, because it explains a lot about why certain chords work with others."
guitarlessons,38vuw0,newaccount,2,Sun Jun 7 11:00:27 2015 UTC,"Yes! Learn a lot of songs... figure out why everything works within that song. Learn new chords and how they can apply to songs you already know. Instead of trying full chords, try learning triads and how they can be used for rhythm (like Roxanne by The Police).  Licks? Lead type stuff? When you learn a new lick/solo, change one note of that lick and practice that. Then change two... then three. It'll end up being a totally different lick after awhile. Move it to different positions, different keys. You'd be amazed at how much you can get out of just one lick."
guitarlessons,38vuw0,gschmittling,2,Tue Jun 9 15:33:36 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but play with different keys, play the key I thru VII, then VII thru I, then start randomly changing the order in which you play the chords, until you find something pleasurable to the ear. Then use a pivot chord, to change to another key, then back again. You'll be surprised with what you come up with!"

guitarlessons,38v11m,Akoustyk,3,Sun Jun 7 16:14:31 2015 UTC,"I would say that the limit is probably 3 or 4. 2 you can definitely do, but you only have 4 fingers, plus maybe a thumb, but your hand can only move in certain ways, and you only have 6 strings.   It's basically impossible to freestyle like that though. But some guys do do it. Tommy emmanuel does some cool stuff like that, like day tripper, but it is all practiced and choreographed, because it's pretty confusing even to learn to do it that way.   It's a lot easier on a piano. On a guitar, it's too tough to work out on the fly."

guitarlessons,38t4j2,Rainymood_XI,7,Sat Jun 6 16:19:10 2015 UTC,"It's about rhythm and technique. It gets easier the more you play, and starts to come naturally. I hope you noticed the capo used in that particular tab, remember that's not always necessary, anything can be transposed or just barred.   I've never actually heard this song before here's a few youtube lessons, at least one of them should be useful.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bYoJq-m29c  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW11HmXrXVU  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw4snZpDlL4  There a plenty others out there, good luck."
guitarlessons,38t4j2,theoriginalmack,5,Sat Jun 6 16:41:08 2015 UTC,"You picked a doozie of a song to begin with.  The reason you are not hearing the same sounds is because Ed fingerpicks more than he strums.  Strumming this song you will not get the same sound at all, and with the chord sheet you have it is going to be really difficult(C and C/E are just about the same chord). This ) is a far better version of the song for strumming.  D and D/F# are distinctly different and it sounds better strait strummed.    Personally I would follow /u/theoriginalmack's links on YouTube(the chords I linked above  are the ones used by them) and learn to fingerpick a little it will come in handy and it is easier to learn when you are beginning before you develop habits that make it harder to pick up later."
guitarlessons,38t4j2,Furiou5,2,Sat Jun 6 21:10:04 2015 UTC,"Try and isolate the guitar and really listen to the rhythm, noise level and feel. Then slowly start to reproduce what you hear.  You'll need to learn more chords too!   Dm is minor so learn all the minor chords as well as major.  A guitar tutor would be a good place to start. Even if it is just a few lessons."

guitarlessons,38t4j2,revmouse,2,Sat Jun 6 18:23:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with that particular song, but in general, tabs you find online are often simplified versions of a song. The chords provide a structure for the melody (usually your vocals). The actual recorded version may be much more complex or require techniques not expressed in the tab.   It's ok to start slow though. Learn how to change between chords with a simple strumming pattern. It doesn't have to sound like the real song. Think of it as your own cover version. To be honest it's probably going to suck but try to have fun and don't give up.   Work on being good at simple things and add skills gradually."
guitarlessons,38t4j2,LennyFackler,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:26:50 2015 UTC,"I'm a rank amateur. I started with music like this with tabs and just strummed whatever felt good with a pic. Then one day I just threw away the pic and starting finger picking. Not terribly good at first but I got better and better with practice. I think this is a far more natural and ""organic"" way to play music than to just memorize:  A) Someone else's strumming pattern  B) Someone else's picking pattern  It is actually more like fun and less like work to learn this way. And I think I sound pretty good just letting my fingers find their own way."

guitarlessons,38o4ar,Daedalus42,2,Fri Jun 5 13:57:33 2015 UTC,Awesome mate. This is the first post about modes I've seen here where someone does the right thing and keeps the root the same-allowing them to hear the different sounds. Most people play C Ionian D Dorian E Phrygian and then wonder what the point of them is! Excellent resource thank you :)
guitarlessons,38o4ar,monoploy,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:06:54 2015 UTC,i don't think this is really the best way to go about learning modes. It's really hard to get a feel for overall tonality without some sort of reference behind it. Simple scale shapes don't really convey any useful knowledge about modes.
guitarlessons,38o4ar,TheRevEv,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:29:59 2015 UTC,i agree with you  I like the diagram but I sort of have an idea of whats going on in modes. I couldnt imagine using this as a starting point  i guess useful for memorizing the general pattern involved but thats really it I think
guitarlessons,38o4ar,DougfromDoug,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:49:06 2015 UTC,"patterns are a bad way to go about learning modes. If you don't know these patterns, then you need to actually learn the basic major (Ionian) scale, before trying to tackle any modal theory. These same patterns repeat up and down the neck for any given scale/mode.   To simplify: take the A Aeolian shape pictured, just running through that shape won't give you any idea of what the difference is between that and C Ionian, D Dorian, E Phrygian, etc. Because they are all the same notes/shape. I really think that trying to approach modes in this way wastes a students time, and can lead to a misunderstanding of how modes actually work."
guitarlessons,38o4ar,TheRevEv,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:39:56 2015 UTC,"You're exactly right. All I meant by pattern was that the ionion scale is set (the pattern is set), and just gets moved around fr different modes - assuming constant root."
guitarlessons,38rvp1,trustmeimnotadick,5,Sat Jun 6 07:31:19 2015 UTC,"You learn 3 chords and two scales, one of which you only use a few notes out of and the other you use for soloing. You could get this good in a year if your practices it every day, though the touch and timing might take a bit longer."
guitarlessons,38rvp1,newaccount,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:50:48 2015 UTC,Any scales in particular?
guitarlessons,38rvp1,tomthespaceman,2,Mon Jun 15 20:22:43 2015 UTC,"Major for rhythm, blues scale (min pent + b5) for soloing. Mix them up a bit."

guitarlessons,38rvp1,tomthespaceman,2,Mon Jun 15 21:11:44 2015 UTC,"No worries, listen to some Muddy Waters to see how the major scale is used for the rhythm guitar and blues scale for lead. SRV, who did the original of the linked song, does the same thing, albeit with a Texan flavour - plus he's ridiculously good."
