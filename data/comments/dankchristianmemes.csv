dankchristianmemes,3dwpl1,BB_Queen,27,Mon Jul 20 04:17:27 2015 UTC,"Theological differences between Lutherans and Baptists. I'm a Southern Baptist, so this may sound a little biased. Lutherans believe that baptism is necessary component of becoming a Christian. They don't really care how it's done, from sprinkling like a Catholic to dunking in a lake, but it still serves as a means for grace, like a sacrament.   Baptists, on the other hand, view baptism as purely symbolic. The only way to be saved is through a personal relationship with God that the individual decides, not water. Baptism is merely symbolic of washing away sins now that you've been renewed (born again, or so Nicodemus heard) in Christ.   This is probably the most common debate you'll see between Baptists and Lutherans: what is the purpose of baptism? Both denominations have roots in Martin Luther, and Luther was strictly against the establishment Catholic Church, which practiced infant baptism as the first sacrament. Baptists reject that sentiment, but Lutherans seem to cling on."

dankchristianmemes,3dwpl1,BB_Queen,7,Mon Jul 20 04:54:06 2015 UTC,No problem! The idea behind the joke is just that Lutherans have trouble answering that question because their likely answer would contradict with what their namesake might say. At least that's my take on it.

dankchristianmemes,3dwpl1,whatnobodyknew,7,Mon Jul 20 09:48:48 2015 UTC,"Being a good person is not the same as being born again. It's a harsh reality that, in the eyes of God, there are no ""good"" people. Everyone is born with sin and as human beings, it's in our nature. Our only salvation is from the sacrifice Jesus made around 2,000 years ago. It was the ultimate sacrifice. I'm sure you're familiar with Abraham and Isaac? That was Old Testament typology that foreshadowed what would happen when God gave his son for all of humanity.   The doctrine you have summarized is universalism, which states that because God is good, everyone will go to Heaven. Or maybe you meant that there is no God and we should all strive to be good people just because it's the right thing to do. The fact is that there's no scriptural basis for this sort of thinking. Paul encountered multiple heresies in his time that were similar, such as Gnosticism. Being a good person is not nearly enough. It takes an acceptance of Jesus's ultimate sacrifice on the cross and the desire to have a personal relationship with him.   Relating back to the earlier comment, a quick dunk in water isn't enough to save you either."

Being a good person is not the same as being born again.   That's for sure.  It's the reason why so many Christians I've met feel comfortable acting like hostile, violent jerks.  If being saved is important and acting good isn't, why hold back, right?   Everyone is born with sin and as human beings, it's in our nature.   Then why are so many Christians, after they're cleansed of their sins, such bad people?   It's a harsh reality that, in the eyes of God, there are no ""good"" people.   Not according to Acts 10:15.   The doctrine you have summarized is universalism, which states that because God is good, everyone will go to Heaven.    What I said was, ""What does it matter, as long as you're a good person?""

Or maybe you meant that there is no God and we should all strive to be good people just because it's the right thing to do. The fact is that there's no scriptural basis for this sort of thinking.   I believe that's called secular humanism.   Paul encountered multiple heresies in his time that were similar, such as Gnosticism.   Isn't Gnosticism the idea that a higher being can directly inspire or pass knowledge to a human?  Isn't that how scripture came about in the first place?   Being a good person is not nearly enough. It takes an acceptance of Jesus's ultimate sacrifice on the cross and the desire to have a personal relationship with him.   Why?   Relating back to the earlier comment, a quick dunk in water isn't enough to save you either.   Why not, if it cleanses the person of their sins as sanctioned by God?"
dankchristianmemes,3dwpl1,whatnobodyknew,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:07:00 2015 UTC,"That's for sure. It's the reason why so many Christians I've met feel comfortable acting like hostile, violent jerks. If being saved is important and acting good isn't, why hold back, right?   You're absolutely right, and I'm sure all Muslims just love to kill their fellow man with reckless abandon. A lot of people who self-identify as Christian really don't act like it. A poll conducted by ABC 2 days ago shows that 83% of Americans identify as Christian. I would strongly disagree with that statistic, considering the way 83% of people act. I'm not perfect and I have my moments, but I have a church community to help keep me in check and the Word of God to guide me. Not all ""Christians"" subscribe to that idea.    Then why are so many Christians, after they're cleansed of their sins, such bad people?   Really the same answer. If you are truly washed in the blood of the lamb, to quote the song and the scripture, it should be your natural inclination to become more like Christ. You want to be a better person. Some people do it because they think that gets them into Heaven, which is not the right motivation.   Not according to Acts 10:15.   When it comes to the Bible, context is everything. In that context, Peter was hungry and God presented him with four-legged animals and birds. Peter called them unclean as they would in Jewish tradition and God contested that claim, saying that he had made them clean and therefore they are not unholy. No one is without sin.    What I said was, ""What does it matter, as long as you're a good person?"" Implying if the PERSON is good, they'll get into heaven. And by the way, it's easy to demonstrate that God isn't good, at least by human standards of good.   I was quite aware of what you meant, as I've heard it a million times. The idea behind universalism is:   God is good. I do community service, volunteering, and charity, so I am a good person. If God is good and just as the Bible says he is, he must let me into Heaven.   And as for your God isn't good comment, you are completely wrong. I believe you're making reference to God's actions in the Old Testament. Our God has both mercy and wrath, compassion and punishment. Sodom and Gomorrah is a favorite of Reddit, in particular. God delivered justice on a people that did not follow his commands. He warned those loyal to Him to flee and not look back. Lot's wife did. She disobeyed God and perished for it.   By human standards, I'd say there's some parallels. The first established law in civilization was Hammurabi's Code (eerily similar to the Ten Commandments/Mosaic Law). Your punishment corresponds to your actions. As long as you're a good citizen and you do right by your fellow man and obey the law, you're fine. But frankly, humanity is often wrong.   I believe that's called secular humanism.   Indeed, and there's no scriptural basis for it.    Isn't Gnosticism the idea that a higher being can directly inspire or pass knowledge to a human? Isn't that how scripture came about in the first place?   That's a word that has changed a lot over the years. It even has multiple definitions today. Back then, it came from thinkers/philosophers. As it is mentioned in the Bible, it is defined as the belief that the physical and spiritual world are not at all intertwined and what you do in this world does not affect the other. Basically, an excuse to practice hedonism.   Why?   To put it simply, it takes an internal change and understanding. Before Jesus's death, the Jews would cleanse themselves of sin by annually taking a perfect lamb (one without any defects or flaws) to the temple and sacrificing it as atonement. This was the way that they physically acknowledged and paid for their sins. When Jesus died, however, he was the ultimate sacrifice. It was literally God incarnate surrendering to death for all of humanity. Although he was perfect, unlike anyone to have ever walked the Earth and since, he gave himself for us although he did not have to. The ultimate sacrifice made out of love.    Why not, if it cleanses the person of their sins as sanctioned by God?   That goes back to the ultimate sacrifice. I can internally know that Jesus has saved me of my sin and that everything I have done and will do is atoned for. The acceptance of his sacrifice and belief in God as my savior is enough to call myself a Christian by biblical standards. Baptism is a nice symbolic thing to do, especially in front of your church to demonstrate your transition into new life, but is really unnecessary as far as salvation goes.  Hope I answered your questions adequately!"

The lord works in mysterious ways, what light guides some to faith afears others into the devils arms. The lord sayeth not to light a lamp and place it under a bushel yet also not to lay pearls before swine - was it not a sinner that bore the cross and a honourable Roman the nails? did the lord not wash the whores feet and spurn the wealth of tyrants? love the sinner and hate the sin, bless your brothers freedoms while too being his keeper in faith.    A light is best placed in darkness, more fool the big man who takes a torch to a cathedral - much praise the legshort of the hovel lighting a match to call the rabble unto righteousness.  What may seem flippant and foolish to the wise is dearer to the lord than all the fine and worthy arts of the devout if but by it one sinner to sanctum is saved."
