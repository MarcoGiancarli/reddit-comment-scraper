Here, it's not the women who are ""flaunting"" themselves, but the law that is being ""flaunted"", meaning they'd be proudly and defiantly displaying the law itself.   Curiously the definition right under that seems to mean the exact opposite: ""to ignore or treat with disdain"". This seems to be the actual definition of ""flout"" but I think it's one of those cases where a word is misused so much that it just gets adapted into the language.  http://www.vocabulary.com/articles/chooseyourwords/flaunt-flout/"

Chelsea wants to win, Arsenal wants to entertain and win the game in a style that is palatable to them - how can you say one of them is wrong? if an arsenal fan enjoys watching his team embody a perspective (and cares more about that than winning), how can you say he's lost something even if the team doesn't accomplish the apparently clear objective of the game. and you can't really call it a geographic difference causing the perspective, the stadiums are in the same city.  i got off track there, but i feel like even something with apparently clear-cut objectives can have moral relativism."

I guess a good way to put it is others should be free to choose what they do to and with their own body so long as it doesn't harm others in the process.

Although some degree of the bureaucracies might have been maintained, they were different states with different capitals, and different ruling elites.

Of course china has historically been a thing. The Chinese have had a sense of china-wide national identity since at least the end of the romance of the three kingdoms in 280 CE   ""China"" was ran off the mainland and took residence in Taiwan slightly after WW2.    The KMT government that ran China starting in 1912 fled the mainland to Taiwan because they were defeated in a Civil war with the People's liberation army.  But both sides were ""Chinese"", and considered themselves the rightful government of all of China they just disagreed about what kind of economic system they should have.  The KMT didn't even give up it's claim to be the legitimate government of all of China until the 1970s."

OldSchoolCool,3dy03a,r_e_k_r_u_l,26,Mon Jul 20 20:17:31 2015 UTC,"Except the Roman Empire never really split... The tradition of multiple emperors and multiple Imperial courts stretches back to the 3rd century. It came out of the Crisis of the 3rd Century when Diocletian realized how impossible it was to govern the entire Empire from just Rome.   Romans still considered themselves one Empire but split administration between as many as 4 imperial courts between the 3rd and 5th century. Also, once the ""Western Empire"" fell, the Byzantines did reconquer it for a time. The terms ""Western Roman Empire"" and ""Eastern Roman/ Byzantine Empire"" are more historiographical terms used to differentiate the semi autonomous parts of the empire rather than literal descriptors. If you called someone in Roman Gaul a ""Western Roman"" or tell them that they didn't live in the same Empire as someone in Constantinople they would think you were crazy. Similarly if you called a someone a ""Byzantine"" they would have no idea what you were talking about."

OldSchoolCool,3dxi18,Oatroot,14,Mon Jul 20 18:53:52 2015 UTC,"Well, if you want to be a dick about it, the reason Audrey was so petite was because she grew up in Europe during WW2 (was a courier for the Dutch resistance, even. badass) and she and her family often went hungry. During her career she weighed 103 pounds at 5'7 tall (which is quite thin) and had a 20'' waist. That is insane when you consider most high fashion models are in the 22-23 inch range. But she was just tiny in general. Her size is widely believed to be a product of malnourishment growing up during the German occupation. She went on to do a ton of humanitarian work with UNICEF feeding starving children all over the world."
OldSchoolCool,3dxi18,_funnyface,-12,Mon Jul 20 20:25:28 2015 UTC,"It seems you left out she had severe anorexic disorder.   Hell my dads father was a POW in WW1 and for the rest of his life couldn't drink anything cold, but he was able to put on weight.  You can't blame it on the Germans.  She should've eaten more, but instead you have girls who idol her thinking they can be as thin as she was. Sad."

OldSchoolCool,3dxi18,SMOKIN-ON-BIEBERS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:59:59 2015 UTC,"She was no more anorexic than any other star of her time, much less presently. You cant blame an eating disorder for her size. She was known to lose weight under stress, the same stress that caused her two miscarriages.  ""From November 1944 until May 1945, a period known in Dutch history as ‘the hunger winter’, she suffered terrible starvation. The Germans blockaded her area of the Netherlands, causing mass malnutrition that killed around 18,000 people.  Hepburn, 16, was reduced to eating tulip bulbs and trying to make bread from grass. She spent the war’s closing days hiding from the Nazis in a cellar.  Hepburn’s slight figure — her waist was only 20in — came not from any celeb-style fad diet. It was a legacy of the jaundice, anaemia, respiratory problems and chronic blood disorders she contracted in those desperate days.""  The girls who idolize her don't do it simply because she was petite, but rather because she was a fashion icon. You don't see pro-anorexia people using her as a poster child because she was not severely anorexic. You do, however, see plenty of large women using her as an example to make some kind of ridiculous point that a woman cant be that small naturally or without constantly starving yourself. If you compare photos of Audrey with photos of models with the same measurements, or to photos of people who are severely anorexic (as you claim she was) you can see the difference. Audrey was not bony."

Your picture means nothing.  Also look for candid photos of her not photo shoot photos of course once you find an unflattering pic of her you'll realize your mistake.

I bet you don't make dick from modeling, and probably have an actual job.  Read my edit to my comment before this. Whatever you want to call it is fine, but I would call it anorexia.  If you actually read stories about her she trained her self to not like food and eat the bare minimum to keep her body going.   You must be one dumb textbook model to not google her and read what experts have said about her eating habits.. Later it's not worth trying to convince you your idle should've ate more."

How is that Audrey Hepburn or any stars fault and not your friends? Maybe your friend should have tried exercising.    I have read what experts have said on her habits. That her overall size is from malnutrition. if YOU read anything about her you'd realize she ""trained herself to not eat"" because there was no fucking food. She actually tried sleeping most of the time, even through Christmas, to fight the hunger.  But, hey? Since you think so little about me and my career without even knowing me, here's my website. You can eat a dick, because aside from my waist, I'm the exact same size as Audrey. I don't work out, starve myself, or anything. Some women just look like this.

Well, let's see, we have on the bags, Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know is on third...  Costello: That's what I want to find out.  Abbott: I say Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know's on third.  Costello: Are you the manager?  Abbott: Yes.  Costello: You gonna be the coach too?  Abbott: Yes.  Costello: And you don't know the fellows' names?  Abbott: Well I should.  Costello: Well then who's on first?  Abbott: Yes.  Costello: I mean the fellow's name.  Abbott: Who.  Costello: The guy on first.  Abbott: Who.  Costello: The first baseman.  Abbott: Who.  Costello: The guy playing...  Abbott: Who is on first!  Costello: I'm asking YOU who's on first.  Abbott: That's the man's name.  Costello: That's who's name?  Abbott: Yes.  Costello: Well go ahead and tell me.  Abbott: That's it.  Costello: That's who?  Abbott: Yes.  PAUSE  Costello: Look, you gotta first baseman?  Abbott: Certainly.  Costello: Who's playing first?  Abbott: That's right.  Costello: When you pay off the first baseman every month, who gets the money?  Abbott: Every dollar of it.  Costello: All I'm trying to find out is the fellow's name on first base.  Abbott: Who.  Costello: The guy that gets...  Abbott: That's it.  Costello: Who gets the money...  Abbott: He does, every dollar. Sometimes his wife comes down and collects it.  Costello: Who's wife?  Abbott: Yes.  PAUSE  Abbott: What's wrong with that?  Costello: Look, all I wanna know is when you sign up the first baseman, how does he sign his name?  Abbott: Who.  Costello: The guy.  Abbott: Who.  Costello: How does he sign...  Abbott: That's how he signs it.  Costello: Who?  Abbott: Yes.  PAUSE  Costello: All I'm trying to find out is what's the guy's name on first base.  Abbott: No. What is on second base.  Costello: I'm not asking you who's on second.  Abbott: Who's on first.  Costello: One base at a time!  Abbott: Well, don't change the players around.  Costello: I'm not changing nobody!  Abbott: Take it easy, buddy.  Costello: I'm only asking you, who's the guy on first base?  Abbott: That's right.  Costello: Ok.  Abbott: All right.  PAUSE  Costello: What's the guy's name on first base?  Abbott: No. What is on second.  Costello: I'm not asking you who's on second.  Abbott: Who's on first.  Costello: I don't know.  Abbott: He's on third, we're not talking about him.  Costello: Now how did I get on third base?  Abbott: Why you mentioned his name.  Costello: If I mentioned the third baseman's name, who did I say is playing third?  Abbott: No. Who's playing first.  Costello: What's on first?  Abbott: What's on second.  Costello: I don't know.  Abbott: He's on third.  Costello: There I go, back on third again!  PAUSE  Costello: Would you just stay on third base and don't go off it.  Abbott: All right, what do you want to know?  Costello: Now who's playing third base?  Abbott: Why do you insist on putting Who on third base?  Costello: What am I putting on third.  Abbott: No. What is on second.  Costello: You don't want who on second?  Abbott: Who is on first.  Costello: I don't know.  Abbott & Costello Together:Third base!  PAUSE  Costello: Look, you gotta outfield?  Abbott: Sure.  Costello: The left fielder's name?  Abbott: Why.  Costello: I just thought I'd ask you.  Abbott: Well, I just thought I'd tell ya.  Costello: Then tell me who's playing left field.  Abbott: Who's playing first.  Costello: I'm not... stay out of the infield! I want to know what's the guy's name in left field?  Abbott: No, What is on second.  Costello: I'm not asking you who's on second.  Abbott: Who's on first!  Costello: I don't know.  Abbott & Costello Together: Third base!  PAUSE  Costello: The left fielder's name?  Abbott: Why.  Costello: Because!  Abbott: Oh, he's centerfield.  PAUSE  Costello: Look, You gotta pitcher on this team?  Abbott: Sure.  Costello: The pitcher's name?  Abbott: Tomorrow.  Costello: You don't want to tell me today?  Abbott: I'm telling you now.  Costello: Then go ahead.  Abbott: Tomorrow!  Costello: What time?  Abbott: What time what?  Costello: What time tomorrow are you gonna tell me who's pitching?  Abbott: Now listen. Who is not pitching.  Costello: I'll break your arm, you say who's on first! I want to know what's the pitcher's name?  Abbott: What's on second.  Costello: I don't know.  Abbott & Costello Together: Third base!  PAUSE  Costello: Gotta a catcher?  Abbott: Certainly.  Costello: The catcher's name?  Abbott: Today.  Costello: Today, and tomorrow's pitching.  Abbott: Now you've got it.  Costello: All we got is a couple of days on the team.  PAUSE  Costello: You know I'm a catcher too.  Abbott: So they tell me.  Costello: I get behind the plate to do some fancy catching, Tomorrow's pitching on my team and a heavy hitter gets up. Now the heavy hitter bunts the ball. When he bunts the ball, me, being a good catcher, I'm gonna throw the guy out at first base. So I pick up the ball and throw it to who?  Abbott: Now that's the first thing you've said right.  Costello: I don't even know what I'm talking about!  PAUSE  Abbott: That's all you have to do.  Costello: Is to throw the ball to first base.  Abbott: Yes!  Costello: Now who's got it?  Abbott: Naturally.  PAUSE  Costello: Look, if I throw the ball to first base, somebody's gotta get it. Now who has it?  Abbott: Naturally.  Costello: Who?  Abbott: Naturally.  Costello: Naturally?  Abbott: Naturally.  Costello: So I pick up the ball and I throw it to Naturally.  Abbott: No you don't, you throw the ball to Who.  Costello: Naturally.  Abbott: That's different.  Costello: That's what I said.  Abbott: You're not saying it...  Costello: I throw the ball to Naturally.  Abbott: You throw it to Who.  Costello: Naturally.  Abbott: That's it.  Costello: That's what I said!  Abbott: You ask me.  Costello: I throw the ball to who?  Abbott: Naturally.  Costello: Now you ask me.  Abbott: You throw the ball to Who?  Costello: Naturally.  Abbott: That's it.  Costello: Same as you! Same as YOU! I throw the ball to who. Whoever it is drops the ball and the guy runs to second. Who picks up the ball and throws it to What. What throws it to I Don't Know. I Don't Know throws it back to Tomorrow, Triple play. Another guy gets up and hits a long fly ball to Because. Why? I don't know! He's on third and I don't give a darn!  Abbott: What?  Costello: I said I don't give a darn!  Abbott: Oh, that's our shortstop."

The ""steel and glass"" approach you're discussing is the Chicago School of Architecture that began in the 50's after the war, exemplified by 860 Lake Shore, Inland Steel, 330 N. Wabash (The IBM Building), Dirksen Federal, The Hancock and Sears.  There's also more modern approaches like Lakepoint Towers, which are marvels though not in the minimalist style the city birthed.  The ""gothic-style"", while gorgeous, is only half the equation. The other, just as critical half would belong to Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Bruce Graham.

Looking at the bigger picture from the scale of track homes to stripmalls and all the way to urban design, Modernism was a failure.  My home city is irreparably damaged by Modernist aesthetics and planning. Los Angeles, the once glorified poster child of ""Modernism is the Future! :D"" is nothing but cheap unwalkable ugly suburban sprawl strip malls and freeways.

LA has had horrible city planners (which is a bit of a problem up and down California, really). LA was made to showcase automobiles... it's one gigantic showroom floor. That wasn't caused by Modernism. It was capitalism that made those decisions, and also lead to that city having one of the worst public transit and rail systems out of any major, modern city.  Here's the Smithsonian covering ""nobody walks in LA""  Here's the story of how General Motors got rid of street cars  Chicago was spared this, probably because we were too far from the media hotbeds of the coasts. Walk down the streets of Chicago and you'll see gorgeous gothic high-rises, modernist wonders of skyscrapers, post-war GI housing, prohibition era speakeasys that still run (two of my favorite bars still have secret entrances!), and contemporary masterpieces... all from sidewalks you can actually walk down, or public transport that's surprisingly good by US standards.  You'll also see a lake shore that's public property and cannot be built out by private owners. You'll see green spaces, something LA has never had to my knowledge.  All that has shockingly little to do with architecture and more to do with city planners who know what they're doing (even if they do sometimes demolish gorgeous landmarks, the swine)."

The height wouldn't exist, unless the buildings were super fat at the foundation. ›› See Monadnock Building  You may not like the shiny, metal things, but cost of creation, transportation, installation, and maintenance are all factors that influence the decision of what material from which to build a future skyscraper.

OldSchoolCool,3dw71w,BoomMichaelScoon,28,Mon Jul 20 18:57:07 2015 UTC,It's just crazy to me that muscle cars and cars I adore were everywhere back then. Now they are pretty rare to see on the road. I would love to just go back in time and see the roads of cities filled with mustangs and camaros ect.
OldSchoolCool,3dw71w,__dilligaf__,14,Mon Jul 20 12:55:00 2015 UTC,"Any time I watch retro TV shows and movies I'm enamored with all the old cars. Nobody acts like theyre anything special and they treat them just like the cars we have today, but theyre just so cool.  I'd be awesome just to spend a day in this era and enjoy all the new ""old"" stuff. These buildings today are worse for wear and look a little outdated, but back then they were fairly modern and fresh. It definitely must have been an interesting time to live in, America was a whole different place."
OldSchoolCool,3dw71w,cleh1,2,Mon Jul 20 01:50:08 2015 UTC,"I'd be interested to see a photo of the same view today, to see how the buildings etc have changed. Agree on the cars; I love classic car show 'n shines and the Barrett Jackson auctions."

OldSchoolCool,3dw71w,dubski35,3,Mon Jul 20 12:26:07 2015 UTC,car   My high school boy friend and his buddies had   1968 GTO with flames up the nose - that they dropped a 455 in.  1965 Mustang - original Forest Green. They put a different motor in it too but I can't recall offhand what it was.  1964 gray Fury with a push button tranny that was a sleeper- they put hydraulic lifts under it and capped the headers - running a push button to the inside. So if some muscle car rolled up beside this 'grandma' car he could jack it and uncap the headers at the same time.   It did an 8.5 quarter mile out at the airport (where they used to race).  We called it the Gray Goose.
OldSchoolCool,3dw71w,eat_shit_dummies,2,Mon Jul 20 16:31:00 2015 UTC,Only for a short period of time.  Visit the Woodward Dream Cruise in Michigan and you may get sick of the fumes from these old cars by the end of the day. It's still a blast but it can be a bit intoxicating.

They were anything but ""niche"" three years after this Willie Nelson photo was taken, unlike what some here have suggested. Unless you consider being in every mall in America ""niche"". In the 80s, two things reigned supreme from the get-go: tennis shoes and jeans. This is the era of ""designer fashion"". For shoes, it was now-ubiquitous brands like Nike, Adidas, Pony, Reebok, Puma, New Balance, Converse, and others. For jeans, it was Jordache, Gloria Vanderbilt, Calvin Klein, Chic, and many more. I don't care what New Balance's stock price did in the past few years. It's an old old brand.

OldSchoolCool,3dyy0b,23bucketsofchicken,3,Mon Jul 20 21:26:24 2015 UTC,"Lots of redundancy: Each instrument is duplicated for each pilot, plus there are a few in the middle of the panel that duplicate the two in front of the pilots. In case they give different readings, it gives them something to discuss and debate while the plane flys into th nearest mountain.   There's just a lot of stuff that needs to be controlled manually. But automation is getting good enough that modern airliners can be flown by two pilots, instead of two pilots plus an engineer.   There's also a lot of flexibility built into the systems, so that if electrical power fails on one of the generator, things can be shut down and the electric power can be re-routed to critical systems.   There's a video on YouTube showing some 40 different ways the cockpit lighting on a 787 can be adjusted. I guess that gets filed under ""luxury"" (no, ""flexibility"")."

Pressures, temperatures, % of work, etc. All repeated for the 3rd seat as well.  Switches... Well. Everything from the lights (lots of different ones inside and out...

OldSchoolCool,3dyy0b,CaveExplorer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:17:01 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you're asking, but generally -- Directly in front of each pilot is a set of instruments that tell how the plane is flying: airspeed, artificial horizon, bank and turn, altitude, rate of climb, gyrocompass with a navigation instruments...   The middle panel shows what the engines are doing.   At the top of the panel in the middle, the wide buttons are for the autopilot. There are several modes of operation. You can set it to hold a compass heading, or to home to a beacon. You can set it to climb at a certain rate using the throttles, or at a certain throttle setting.   In the center console, there are the throttles, the flaps, the airbrakes, spoilers... The wheel with the white stripes trims the elevator (fine tuning) and the wide knob trims the rudder. I don't know what the switches to the side are for... circuit breakers?   Behind the throttles on the center console, there are the controls for the radios. Two radios for communication, and two for one kind of navigation radio, and one or two others for other radio nav. systems. When that plane rolled out, GPS didn't exist, and I don't know if this plane uses it, but dang -- there sure isn't much of a navigation display..."

It’s one of the best films of 1980; it’s the best of the biographies of country-western singers that followed (Sweet Dreams, Walk the Line, Ray) as well as all the pseudo-biographical dramas in the country-western genre (Tender Mercies, Crazy Heart, Country Strong, Honkytonk Man, Pure Country, Falling from Grace, etc.).  It’s a naturalistic marvel of a movie with great performances and terrific music.  It’s an uplifting story that proves that anyone with talent and hard work can find success and, sometimes, happiness, doing the thing that he or she loves.  It’s a celebration of music and romance and Americana, even though it was directed by a Britisher who didn’t particularly enjoy country music.  It’s a wonderful movie."

OldSchoolCool,3duszp,NegativeNegative-,9,Sun Jul 19 22:49:23 2015 UTC,"Because most people's futures are mapped out by assumption: birth-school-work-death.  On the Road was about doing something you didn't have to do in the conventional sense.  About finding adventure in your own country, on the roads that ran by your house, and in the minds and creative output of your friends.  It is tied up in the bullshit of the American Dream, which generally manifests as, ""You are free to work a tedious job and buy all of the things you can on your salary.""  As for Kerouac's writing style, it's not for everyone.  There are people who have tried to pull it apart (""That's not writing -- that's typing."") but I can only say if you dig it, it's like jazz, and there's no explaining jazz to someone who just doesn't like jazz.  I've seen people try.  I don't get mad at people who don't like Jack Kerouac; it's valid to be repulsed (more commonly bored or exhausted) by his writing style, and I don't think that makes anyone ""shallow"" or aesthetically deficient or anything along those lines.  He's just not for everyone, and for me, I liked it immediately: it wasn't an acquired taste, and being completely subjective to the point of solipsism, I'd even say to someone who can't get into it to just stop and read something else.  You can be a really inspired, happy, creative person without getting Kerouac.  It'd be interesting to see a Myers-Briggs based chart of who likes Kerouac and who doesn't.  I still think The Dharma Bums is better, though.  And I think the way those guys treated women was appalling.    I think I'd be a pretty conservative person, if it wasn't for the fact that the left's (I use ""left"" very loosely) critique of the American conception of freedom tends to be spot on: what's freedom to a wage slave, or to someone who has to work a job he despises to support a family, or a single mom who has not a moment of free time to herself?"

OldSchoolCool,3duszp,RenegadeMoose,4,Mon Jul 20 15:29:23 2015 UTC,"I think the ""never read anything like it"" reason is why a lot of young people end up loving the book and looking fondly back on it, but Kerouac was a very poetic storyteller, the meter of his prose influenced by jazz musicians blowing streams of notes, his coinage of the ""spontaneous prose"" style.  But i think these thinks are even more evident in certain sections of Lonesome Traveler, especially the chapter when he is at Big Sur."

On the Road is just a continuous rant, a non-stop telling of his own wild experiences, and an expression for his love of living and being there in the moment (and not being there as well).

I won't watch the posted 1980s interviews where he was a jerk because I don't want to shatter my illusion.  On the History channel show, when he's interviewing people he actually listens to what people have to say.  I love how he intersperses his opinions on some historical facts, like ""this is BS and I can't keep my mouth shut about it"" attitude.  I love how he jumps in at every opportunity to explore history hands-on.  It's a great show and if he was a jerk in the past, he's outgrown it or he hides it very well because if you watch that show you can't help but love him.

Too old is a nice way of saying he was going to be infirm sooner than later.  McCain had physical and certainly mental issues from his stay in the POW camp.  I respect the man but in his problems were catching up to him and it was obvious.     It was like Bob Dole when he ran for president.  Dole had been severely wounded in Italy during WW2.  His right arm and hand were basically useless.  He would clutch a pen all the time in his right hand to make it look less useless.  Seriously.  He probably had PTSD because he was also famous for his bursts of anger.  I respect the man but he was not up for running a campaign in general and certainly not against Clinton.  I think he was sent as a sacrificial lamb so a good candidate would not be blown out.  Bernie Sanders has lived a peaceful life and never been wounded.  If he won the primary his age would certainly come up because no campaign manager worth his salt would let such an easy issue go unused.  In a debate about it he could certainly paraphrase Reagan's famous comeback for a double whammy.

So many politicians have never gone abroad for more than one or two publicity trips, so it can be easy to dismiss their opinions as campaign trail talking points. But listening to a guy who had been to Syria dozens of times in the span of several months at the height of the Civil War really made everyone in the room listen to him even though he didn't speak above a whisper.

As he raised himself up and cocked his arm to throw his last grenade, a German soldier inside the bunker fired a rifle grenade, which struck his right elbow, nearly severing most of his arm and leaving his primed grenade reflexively ""clenched in a fist that suddenly didn't belong to me anymore"".[12] Inouye's horrified soldiers moved to his aid, but he shouted for them to keep back out of fear his severed fist would involuntarily relax and drop the grenade. While the German inside the bunker reloaded his rifle, Inouye pried the live grenade from his useless right hand and transferred it to his left. As the enemy soldier aimed his rifle at him, Inouye tossed the grenade into the bunker and destroyed it. He stumbled to his feet and continued forward, silencing the last German resistance with a one-handed burst from his Thompson before being wounded in the leg and tumbling unconscious to the bottom of the ridge. He awoke to see the worried men of his platoon hovering over him. His only comment before being carried away was to order them back to their positions, saying ""nobody called off the war!""[13]""   holy shit."

OldSchoolCool,3dsgs8,Till_Lindemann,26,Sun Jul 19 06:10:40 2015 UTC,"Actually reading what he went through is horrible, I had no idea he was captured for 5 years. He also refused early release because they would not release all of the prisoners.  Source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain  John McCain's capture and subsequent imprisonment began on October 26, 1967. He was flying his 23rd bombing mission over North Vietnam when his A-4E Skyhawk was shot down by a missile over Hanoi.[34][35] McCain fractured both arms and a leg ejecting from the aircraft,[36] and nearly drowned when he parachuted into Trúc Bạch Lake.[34] Some North Vietnamese pulled him ashore, then others crushed his shoulder with a rifle butt and bayoneted him.[34] McCain was then transported to Hanoi's main Hỏa Lò Prison, nicknamed the ""Hanoi Hilton"".[35]  Although McCain was badly wounded, his captors refused to treat his injuries, beating and interrogating him to get information; he was given medical care only when the North Vietnamese discovered that his father was a top admiral.[37] His status as a prisoner of war (POW) made the front pages of major newspapers.[38][39]  McCain spent six weeks in the hospital while receiving marginal care.[34] By then having lost 50 pounds (23 kg), in a chest cast, and with his hair turned white,[34] McCain was sent to a different camp on the outskirts of Hanoi[40] in December 1967, into a cell with two other Americans who did not expect him to live a week.[41] In March 1968, McCain was put into solitary confinement, where he would remain for two years.[42]  Young man, middle-aged woman, young boy, middle-aged man, all in formal attire With mother Roberta, brother Joe, and father John S. McCain Jr., 1951  Formal portrait of young, dark-haired man in white naval uniform At the Naval Academy, 1954  Four military pilots posed in, on, or in front of, silver jet with United States markings With his squadron (front right) and T-2 Buckeye trainer, 1965  Ten men in water, surrounding one man being floated on wooden poles and tires Being pulled from Trúc Bạch Lake in Hanoi[43], 1967  In mid-1968, John S. McCain Jr. was named commander of all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater, and the North Vietnamese offered McCain early release[44] because they wanted to appear merciful for propaganda purposes,[45] and also to show other POWs that elite prisoners were willing to be treated preferentially.[44] McCain turned down the offer; he would only accept repatriation if every man taken in before him was released as well. Such early release was prohibited by the POW's interpretation of the military Code of Conduct: To prevent the enemy from using prisoners for propaganda, officers were to agree to be released in the order in which they were captured.[34]  In August 1968, a program of severe torture began on McCain.[46] He was subjected to rope bindings and repeated beatings every two hours, at the same time as he was suffering from dysentery.[34][46] Further injuries led to the beginning of a suicide attempt, stopped by guards.[34] Eventually, McCain made an anti-American propaganda ""confession"".[34] He has always felt that his statement was dishonorable, but as he later wrote, ""I had learned what we all learned over there: Every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine.""[47][48] Many American POWs were tortured and maltreated in order to extract ""confessions"" and propaganda statements;[49] virtually all of them eventually yielded something to their captors.[50] McCain subsequently received two to three beatings weekly because of his continued refusal to sign additional statements.[51]  McCain refused to meet with various anti-war groups seeking peace in Hanoi, wanting to give neither them nor the North Vietnamese a propaganda victory.[52] From late 1969 onward, treatment of McCain and many of the other POWs became more tolerable,[53] while McCain continued actively to resist the camp authorities.[54] McCain and other prisoners cheered the U.S. ""Christmas Bombing"" campaign of December 1972, viewing it as a forceful measure to push North Vietnam to terms.[48][55]  Altogether, McCain was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for five and a half years. He was released on March 14, 1973.[56] His wartime injuries left him permanently incapable of raising his arms above his head.[57]"

Even though I'm not crazy about her, Condaleeza Rice would have been a better choice, since they wouldn't let him pick Lieberman.    I would not be surpised if choosing Palin was a way for the GOP to sabotage him.  For many years he's been unpopular with his fellow republicans, especially the tea partiers.  They labeled him a rino (republican in name only).  They counted on Obama being a single term president, which he almost was.  Or I could be giving them way too much credit.  They might have thought Palin was a legitimate brilliant choice.  Which in some ways makes the GOP even scarier.  For the record,  I'm a true moderate independent.   I'd love to have a republican candidate I could seriously consider voting for, but it seems like most of the candidates I see on ballots are crazysauce.  It's depressing.

OldSchoolCool,3dqe70,OMGWTF-BOB,181,Sat Jul 18 16:07:09 2015 UTC,"My youngest daughter was born deaf, or at least ""medically hearing impaired"". When she was young and before her CI surgery she would hold her hand to someone neck to feel the vibrations as a person spoke. This often lead to her fingers moving up towards the mouth and sometimes she'd actually place her fingers inside mine or my wife's mouth and feel the tongue movement. The doctor said that it was normal for children her age and disability to do things like this so we never stopped her.  One time in the grocery store she was sitting in the buggy while we were waiting to check out, and I was singing to her (quietly in a muffled tone) so not loud enough to bug the people around us. She was feeling the sounds and she also was feeling my tongue and trying to mimic the same movements with her own. The woman behind us said something rather rude, snatched up her kid and moved to the next lane over.   Sometimes people just see what they want to see, and it's the insecurities or problems in their own minds that cause this."

They're not familiar with how some people are forced to see the world, and often times their responses are the wrong ones. Sort of like when some people meet a blind person. Sometimes they speak louder and slower than they would to someone without a visual impairment. I love it when they respond back with ""I'm blind! Not deaf or mentally challenged""."
OldSchoolCool,3dqe70,Mic_Check_One_Two,7,Sat Jul 18 19:19:25 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of a thread a while ago where someone mentioned being deaf. A redditor responded with a comment in Braille. The deaf person simply responded with something like ""Did you just Braille at me? I'm deaf, not blind..."""
OldSchoolCool,3dqe70,OMGWTF-BOB,3,Sun Jul 19 00:20:13 2015 UTC,Yeah it's funny in its own special way. My daughter knows Braille and has a Braillewriter to send her friend letters (when they're not on the phone).
OldSchoolCool,3dqe70,notsohornyowl,5,Sun Jul 19 01:22:07 2015 UTC,It's actually quite rude to answer that way. Don't you think? Speaking slowly or loudly to a blind person maybe isn't smart but this definitely shows your caring attitude to them and their disability.
OldSchoolCool,3dqe70,OMGWTF-BOB,15,Sat Jul 18 21:21:49 2015 UTC,"People who have disabilities usually get the same responses from so many people that they tend to be a bit short when it comes to things like this. After about ten times or so of someone speaking really loud and slowly you'd probably be agitated too. My daughter attended a school that specializes in teaching hearing and visually impaired children life skills and how to deal with the world around you.  They group up the children where one is blind and the other deaf. This helps each learn the others disability and also teaches them to rely on others for support at certain times (some can be extremely independent to the point that it's a fault). The school is usually during the summer months and my daughter has had the same partner for years. They're best friends and sometimes she stays with us for a few weeks during the summer. I've witnessed people go from normal speech patterns and immediately switch to slow and loud once she took off her glasses or unfolded her cane.   When people do that over and over again it gets to be a pain. I mean honestly.. She's blind what does talking slow and loud have to do with her disability. Sure it might seem a bit rude or ugly, but I guess you'd have to see or experience it for yourself to realize how funny it is. Whereas my daughter will physically unplug her processor and continue to nod during conversations that are annoying her. Everyone has their own coping mechanisms I guess."

OldSchoolCool,3dqe70,OMGWTF-BOB,3,Sun Jul 19 03:25:07 2015 UTC,"It's pretty neat stuff. I'd never have known about it if it wasn't for her, so it's sort of like a secret language.

I didn't pay much attention to her, and I always tried not to cause a scene with her when she was young. Before the CI she was extremely empathetic to the slightest changes in mood. Just scowling could cause her to bust into tears, and a hearing impaired child crying is not a pretty sight. It's difficult to get them to focus on signs or other communication methods to explain what's going on, so you've just got to wait it out."

However, our teachings to them are based mostly on safety and security. Where they give to us the ability to see the world from a different point of view. They see the little miraculous things in life that we often overlook because we've become so accustomed to them.  It's that curiosity and amazement that helps us re visualize the world we used to see before we got all jaded and skeptical. When I try to explain this thought/idea to people I like to use that video of the little girl saying ""look daddy da moon"" as adults we're all like yeah it's the moon... It was there last night and it'll be there tomorrow night. She's so excited to see the moon and share it with someone else, and that's all that matters in that moment."

OldSchoolCool,3dqe70,muhgenetiks,2,Sat Jul 18 19:10:24 2015 UTC,Obviously you didn't deserve that comment but imagine it from her perspective. She gets in line and the guy in front of her is sucking his kids fingers (I'm not saying you were). I'd probably find it strange as well.
OldSchoolCool,3dqe70,Adrian_W_,7,Sun Jul 19 04:42:33 2015 UTC,"I was born deaf, and got a CI surgery at 10, never heard of this... Intresting. I usually understand people through lip-reading, (visually)  not through touch.  Seems pretty damn cool, might try that sometime. Where are you guys from?"
OldSchoolCool,3dqe70,OMGWTF-BOB,26,Sat Jul 18 19:33:45 2015 UTC,"We're from the states, Louisiana specifically. She was a toddler at the time so entirely too young for surgery (at least back then because I've seen many younger children now with implants). She was still in the stages of learning children's signs and had almost zero methods of communication. Inquisitive as most children are she knew that she was different and missing out on what other people were doing (talking). She would feel the vibrations on your throat when you talked and know hers were different than ours when she vocalized.  We went to the doctor about it after the finger thing started, because to be honest... Having someone's fingers rolling around your tongue when you're trying to talk was a bit odd. We weren't sure if we should continue to allow her to do it. When the doctor said it was completely normal and not just a weird thing she did, it was a little more comforting. She continued to find vibrations like my heart beat or the movement of a speaker a relaxing thing. Her favorite stuffed animal was a teddy bear that had a heart that glowed and beat.  She'd lay her head on it and press the paw to activate it all night long. After her CI surgery and maybe about the third or fourth adjustment/programming session I remember her laying her head on my chest and I guess actually hearing the beat for the first time. I instantly turned into a bowl of jello and cried like a baby, because she was crying (I'm actually choked up typing it out). When she's upset or something she will come into the living room and lay her head on my chest the same way to this day. By far a true daddy's girl."
OldSchoolCool,3dqe70,Adrian_W_,6,Sat Jul 18 19:55:20 2015 UTC,"Hm, interesting. I've come across hundreds of deaf kids when I went to a conference one time, that method wasn't even heard of, only with speakers. I would try lip-reading more, pretty helpful, especially with strangers/acquaintances and longer distances. I'm from B.C., Canada.  Oh, and CI's are so awesome, I hear everything that everyone else hears, so she isn't missing out. Look it up on their website, and they should have a waterproofing accessory for it for swimming."
OldSchoolCool,3dqe70,OMGWTF-BOB,3,Sat Jul 18 20:23:31 2015 UTC,"I'm from B.C., Canada.   Have you ever been to any of the conferences or meet ups in the states? We met a few Canadians in Savannah Georgia a few years back, and I didn't know so many came down to the states for these gatherings. This one was a multi disability conference hearing, visual and speech disabilities.    Oh, and CI's are so awesome, I hear everything that everyone else hears, so she isn't missing out. Look it up on their website, and they should have a waterproofing accessory for it for swimming.   She's had hers for quite some time now, and even gotten an upgraded processor (believe that's the correct term) since then. She actually still prefers to unplug a lot. I call it shutting out the world, but she's got excellent speech with or without it. When the implant was first installed they couldn't get something ""just right"". That apparently meant the device wasn't functioning properly. It took numerous trips back and forth between their offices and home (a three plus hour trip one way) to finally get everything set perfect. We were in the monitoring room when she came to me for the first time fully ""hearing"" things."
OldSchoolCool,3dqe70,Adrian_W_,3,Sat Jul 18 21:22:48 2015 UTC,"I generally don't go to these conferences, as I'm doing really well off, vast majority of people don't even notice I'm deaf and assume my hearing aids / CI are some fancy earbuds. And the deaf community doesn't intrest me at all. The only reason I went once was to skip a few days of school and go to an amusement park during halloween.  The multiple trips back and forth isn't the malfunctioning device. It's tuning. Kinda like wearing in some new shoes. When you first put on the Cochear, you can't set it to some setting and off she goes.  You start out small. Low sensitivity, and low loudness, and a roughed out map of the hearing loss. Come back a week later and slightly adjust the loudness higher and the sensitivity. These trips start to span out over time. I've had this CI for about 5 years now, and it's fully maxed out. I still do a checkup yearly (4 hour drive) to keep things tuned.  The unplugging is something I do as well, it's quite relaxing."
OldSchoolCool,3dqe70,OMGWTF-BOB,2,Sat Jul 18 21:41:50 2015 UTC,"There was actually something wrong with the transmitter and something was done to make it function properly without having to go back and remove and replace it. She now goes about every nine months to a year as well for check ups. We try to keep her involved in the community, because they are the only ones that can truly understand what she feels/goes through. We're definitely supportive, but there's just certain things that we will never understand. However, there are times when she turns off and she'll tell me that she enjoys the quiet. She doesn't think of herself as disabled nor do we."
OldSchoolCool,3dqe70,Adrian_W_,3,Sat Jul 18 22:03:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think of myself as disabled either :p  Sucks to hear about the faulty transmitter, the road trips are mind-numbing."

They still regularly have their children taken away from them for no good reason. They still get hassled on airlines when using service dogs and canes. In most places literacy is still considered being able to push a play button on a tape recorder. And those who can read braille still struggle getting access to literature.  And worst of all they still are made fun of and at the same time looked at as objects of pity.

I'm the child of two blind people and we've never heard of this happening, let alone been on the radar of social services, although there may be cultural differences (we're in the UK.) They've never been hassled on airlines, if anything, we get amazing treatment especially if the dogs are with us. Kindle books can be read out loud, making access to books far far far easier than they used to be, along with Audible, RNIB services etc. Most blind people now use computer and phone technology rather than Braille, it's pretty out of touch (heh) due to how inaccessible it is, funnily enough.   However, I agree that they are made fun of on Reddit. My mum is a successful high level physiotherapist and my Dad is a piano tuner. Both have full time jobs, a big house in a nice area, active social lives, are skilled in using computers and smartphones and yet there are still idiots who write things like 'upvoted for visibility' or bfierhgiwhgwoeaweofh implying a blind person typing every single fucking time anything to do with blind people is posted, it makes me mad."

Couldn't you just tell somebody, ""Yeah, that was Stevie Wonder and we've got a picture of the two of you!"" and just hand them a Polaroid of a dog or something? Then they'd go their whole lives showing people that photograph with great pride and not only would they never know the picture wasn't of them and Stevie Wonder, but the repeated showing to people of a picture of a dog would in fact cast doubt on whether or not they ever even met!  Sorry. I'm sorry."

But that it would also be an interesting sensation for a blind person who's never seen a tongue and might not have been licked by a person in their life, let alone being licked by Stevie Wonder....  Human tongues feel different to dog tongues and especially cat tongues after all...  Alas, this is not so and the boy has probably gone through his life never having been licked by Stevie Wonder. Shame."

OldSchoolCool,3ds5ea,angryoldduck,4,Sat Jul 18 22:56:11 2015 UTC,"Here is some more info he gave me in his email:   My bike was a Triumph TR6. I think it may have been a 1966 model. According to Wikipedia, they did make a version with high pipes for desert racing, but I don’t remember ever having seen one.  It had a 650cc engine that had been rebuilt by the previous owner with special high-compression pistons, which gave it a little more horse power. I believe I’d had it up to 110 mph. I did not have a speedometer or even rear view mirrors, because I thought the bike looked better without all that stuff. The previous owner did all of the custom work on the bike, including the small ‘peanut’ tank, the lace over-spray paint job, removing the front fender, the ‘Z’ handlebars. The guy who rebuilt the engine had done a really good job. Triumphs were notorious for leaking oil, but this bike never did; the engine was always clean. (that is, until my friend wrecked it)"

The unfortunate thing for me was that on the other side of this door was a coffee bar......where the models all wanted to get bloody decaffeinated, non sugar skim milk blahblahblah. Heh......I always said no.  In the end they all complained to the head of security in the building. So much so that he felt the need to come and talk to me in person about what I was doing.

I don't care much for older music from that era, but for some reason 14 year old me insisted on buying all of her albums when 'California Girl' came out and I still listen to her stuff regularly.

If someone can show a connection, share the photo but you should retain the original or a copy for your own family history.

They're hilarious, human-like in mannerisms, mostly scavengers, and can be dispatched pretty easily (if you're not threatening their cubs).   My grandmother, who was born on the Latvian-Belorussian frontier, and grew up on a farm in Maine, was FAR more afraid of, and aggressive toward, moose than she was black bears. She chased bears off with a pan and a spoon. She shot moose. If you were a moose and digging through her garden, Baba was not to be fucked with."
OldSchoolCool,3dlnpk,JonnyBox,3,Fri Jul 17 14:34:15 2015 UTC,"One time I was staying at a buddies house in the Poconos for a few days.

Probably not the smartest move (although I know a lot of people from Pennsyltucky, and its probably far from the dumbest thing they'll do in their lives either.) The bear was booking it, and I suppose doing shit like that helps somewhat to balance out idiots feeding them."
OldSchoolCool,3dlnpk,fondots,3,Fri Jul 17 16:39:34 2015 UTC,Black bear are actually easy to spook off. They would generally only attack if you come between a mother and cubs or somehow corner them.

I don't remember all the details as it's been a while as I had stumbled across a lot of this in FS archives, but he was paraded around a lot, in a really little cage, particularly as an adolescant.   I remember finding a stack of pretty horrible photos of him being dragged about by his neck.  To get him to pose, they would regularly hold him up by his neck (until he got too large) Look a little more closely at whats happening in this image; http://www.foresthistory.org/research/Galleries/FirePreventionPromotional_Smokey_Gallery/images/FHS3252th.jpg  And this one; http://www.foresthistory.org/research/Galleries/FirePreventionPromotional_Smokey_Gallery/images/FHS3254th.jpg  They never let him mate or be with another bear because of public perception, he was a lot of stimulants to keep him active for the kiddies, and lived out the majority of his life in solitude.   He was kinda' in the wrong place at the wrong time being discovered just a few years after the campaign was launched.  And Smokey Bear was wildly popular before the actual bear showed up on the scene. At one point in time, he received as much as or more (don't remember, exactly) mail as Santa Clause - they even gave him his own zip-code.    But the few photos of him with Judy are pretty cute;  http://newmexico.watchdog.org/files/2013/07/smokey-bear.jpg"

In fact the kind of running shoes the people behind her were wearing would have been pretty cutting-edge in 1976; most casual ""tennis shoes"" back then were more like Chuck Taylors or Keds.  Dr. Scholls still makes those same type of sandals today, and those shorts were still common in the 1980s.  No one used black and white for family photos in 1976; this is apparently from a newspaper or yearbook, and they commonly used black and white film."

By bringing both showmanship and a sense of businesslike expertise to the art (see the film ""Pumping Iron"" for a look at his bodybuilding years), he was one of the first people to start the cultural revolution towards physical culture belonging equally to gay and straight men alike.

Met in the wake of war, the world just set free. Twas a Minnesota farm boy and a Latvian lady alas! They locked eyes at a party, the rest is in the past.  “It was love at first sight” proclaimed the farm boy. He saw it in a flash, now's no time to be coy. ""I must make her my wife, or I'd be a fool."" Pursue her he did, shan’t forget to wipe the drool.  Beginnings were rough, let me tell you my friends. Money was tight, odd jobs seemed to have no end. The tales to be told! Even books could be inscribed. Then came Lunds Electric, then life was divine!  They traveled the world, many memories were made! Through toil and joy their love never did fade... This jubilation is but a blink of the full narration. So let us remember the tale of their true elation!  Though life can seem fleeting, bodies will grow old. They may have uncovered the one truth to be told: Life is short, the key to hapiness, is love all along. So find love in one another, dance, and sing a song!  Grandma and Grandpa, you've taught me so much. Everyone around, graced with your sweet touch. You've inspired us all, thats clear to see. So time be proud, happy 70th anniversary!  From war time, to marriage, then a family of four. Time seemed to fly but one thing is for sure. A love this deep cannot be born overnight. A spectacular union, a love story so right."

I mean... most adults own a nice coat. It's the hat that makes people look so uniformed because you can't see their hair, but that's the only thing I can think of.   Also jeans weren't a thing that people wore except while working, really. Trousers were the norm. Also shoes traditionally were pretty standard. It's like seeing running shoes; most people wear them, at least until this decade. In the last 10 years I've seen so many different types of shoes more than I did say in 2000 even. Pumps, sneakers (like converse, etc), different types of dress shoes and styles, plain ""boots"" that you wear every day.   Like, in 1990, you wore running shoes. That was it. They had to have some 45 degree stripes on them too and some reflective neon striping on the trim.   TL;DR don't feel bad.

How do I start? I've tried to copy http://imgur.com/3WPPWZN ones that I found cool http://imgur.com/iBzrsVI . I realize for this I probably need a fresh curve and a straight edge. Usually I just do something silly to ad to my very non professionally drawn cards that I do for fun http://imgur.com/rt6Up5O .  I've started to try to change my handwriting too http://imgur.com/tWki2Ol which is hard to do.  Anyway any advice? I know I really suck at this and these pictures aren't great but I'd love to be good! I'm in love with how good really letters look and how fonts work as a whole."
OldSchoolCool,3diapu,Essjayc,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:14:20 2015 UTC,"WOW. You did those with what exactly? They're really clean for someone just beginning!   I'm not a HUGE lettering guy, I'm more into comics, but I wanted to design my own type face and there are a lot of rules to doing things like that, so I looked it up and got interested in how it's done.   French curves are really cool, and you can actually pretty easily make some if you have a good printer and a bit of patience. I made a few myself because they're usually quite expensive, and I have access to some really good shop equipment, but it could be easily done in home with a jig saw, some sandpaper, and some high quality hardwood like maple (if you want to varnish it and treat the surface; it looks amazing when glossed which is why I got my guitar made in eagle-eye maple).  Don't use cheap softwood if you want to do this seriously, because it's porous, usually weaker for something thin like a ruler or french curve, and it's harder to cut precisely.   If you aren't THAT frugal and crafty, you can make some out of card as well, or even really thick bristol if you want to pencil them in before inking. I don't recommend inking with anything other than felt tip and proper paper if you ARE going to use a paper-based homemade curve or rule.   Honestly you seem like you put a lot of effort into it already, which is great. A lot of this is actually your technique and your tools when you get to this point. It's hard to tell in some of your pics, but it looks like a few of your edges bled, and your colour filling is uneven and spotty because you're over-saturating your paper. This is common when you work on porous paper meant for home printers, or those hillory three hole punch lined paper sheets.   I recommend going to a proper art store, and looking at a Moleskine book (you don't have to buy, just go look). The reason is they have a very high quality thicker paper that isn't super porous. It's meant for sketching and light inking. It's also very high quality as I mentioned, and very uniform.   As for techniques, I've been learning to draw comics and ink them digitially, but the same techniques apply for how to draw your lines. When I work with crow quill and ink, I will use my whole arm and use sweeping strokes for smooth lines, but if it's a tight curve and a solid black bar (like a letter, not an outline), I usually will ink a line and slowly push the line over to my pencil if it wasn't accurate the first time.   Practice with just drawing will improve your form a lot. You should be using your whole arm as well. For very minute details or fixes it's fine to not move your arm, but this is bad for trying to draw anything normally except the really small stuff.   Anyway, like I said, I'm not a calligrapher or anything, but it's something I do like to see and do for fun. I think there are a few subreddits for this sort of thing, too.   My advice though, would just to be to practice drawing and inking things. If you like drawing in general, comic book drawing guides (professional aimed ones, not bad youtube videos done by 15 year olds who lack professional experience, even if they ARE good artists) are usually really good and a lot of the same things apply to both lettering and lineart.   Also, comic books generally have a professional letterer too, and the funny thing is companies like Marvel only hire artists who could design literally every part of the book-- penciling in sketches of the scene, refining, inking, colouring, and lettering. They just specialize in one area."

Some is card stock and the lines paper is moleskin-but not the really thick moleskin paper. So maybe the bleeding/over-saturation has more to with my heavy handed ""technique"" than the paper. I usually have to go over parts so I assume it comes from that. So yeah I use microns and paper and that's it. I just free hand it all. I don't trace it first or use and edges or compasses (should I be?). Anyway your compliment made me blush- I really don't think it's very good at all.  I really want a French curve now! I don't think I have the woodworking tools to make one out of wood. But maybe it's possible with an exact I knife and some kind of plastic?   I am really into comic books so I am definitely going to check out tutorials. I know my form is probably awful. I draw pretty much everything sitting on my bed with my back leaning up against a wall with my paper on a big book as a hard surface lol.  Yeah I've heard practice practice practice.

OldSchoolCool,3diapu,Essjayc,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:22:14 2015 UTC,"If you like comic books, I recommend you check out Robert Marzullo on Youtube. He responds to pretty much every question or comment, is a very friendly and helpful guy, and is a brilliant comic book illustrator. His videos are pretty good; they aren't the most amazingly technical or impressive like the guy from Zhang Studios I think? But honestly unless you're a professional, a lot of his stuff is really above your head (or anyone's).   Robert though does very basic videos with really simple concepts that are easy to understand and emulate, but return really cool results. He also makes it look ridiculously easy when he just comes up with a character out of nothing though.   But yeah, check him out. He's really good and has helped me a lot.   My work is very mediocre in my opinion. I'm just learning to get proportions right and trying to get my faces from looking weird. They look so weird lol. Here you go.

It's about their mental capacity to consent to sexual activities with another elder adult.  Which you may or may not agree with, that's fine, but it's meant to be an arbitrary line. Some people are ready at 16 to fuck a 50 year old and be fine, and some would cry and be traumatized at losing their virginity consensually at 26. Society felt we had to put a law there somewhere and it makes sense.  No reasonable person who isn't shouting shitty rhetoric to take the moral high ground is going to deny that some young men and women (""children"" depending on your culture, in America they're children usually) are physically developed at 15-16.   It's just a weird fact of life. I was about 6'0"" and fairly muscular (a fair amount of muscle and 3"" smaller than I am now but still) and was about through all obvious signs of puberty when I was 15-16. Was pretty early by some measures.   I've also seen 16 year old girls with bodies like disproportionate ""perfect"" looking hourglass figures. Faces that looked like they could be in their late 20's. Still children to me, and they're wildly the exception, but is what it is.   Obviously most people lose interest when it comes to the personality and it's inseparable from how it makes you feel less about the physical features, but the law isn't as concerned with those."

I collect WWII uniforms, so whenever I see one of these photos I try to piece together what I can tell from it. He has quite the ribbon rack as well. Two rows is pretty uncommon for a WWII era serviceman. I'm not sure if there's a seventh ribbon on top or it it's a wing. Do you know what he did? Also, below the ruptured duck is a Presidential Unit Citation.   Finally, the left sleeve from top to bottom has the AAF shoulder patch, his rank insignia (Staff Sergeant), overseas service bars (each is six months for a minimum of two years overseas), and a service hash mark indicating three years of total service, though he could have as many as five years."

OldSchoolCool,3di94t,SugarcaineZuzu,5,Thu Jul 16 17:03:13 2015 UTC,"Obesity was seriously looked down upon then. I've been going through vintage magazines from the mid 1960s and early 1970s, pulling ads to sell on eBay, and I get sucked into the articles about how ""I lost 45 pounds and look at me now!"" And the before picture looks like any random person today. It's startling, and the language is startling too (not just ""fatty"" but the liberal use of ""Negro"" and others).   Food was different and people were more active on a daily basis. Housewifery was hard labor. Times have changed A LOT."

I've been buying vintage band shirts from the 70's/80's, and you wouldn't believe how much slimmer people were back then just by looking at the measurements. A size large back then is now considered a size medium in today's standards. It's eye opening."
OldSchoolCool,3di94t,woozy99,2,Thu Jul 16 18:42:07 2015 UTC,"The 2 fat people that were  made fun of were Jackie Gleason and a singer named Kate Smith. They were considered HUGE. Go look at their Google Images. It's pretty shocking how ordinary they look now.  Food was different, but honestly, people ate quite a bit. There was no HFCS, MSG, or other ugliness. It wasn't the 20's, housewives mostly had washers and vacuum cleaners. The hard times of life were really before WWII for most people.  I never heard of a 300 pound person. They would have been in the Circus. It was looked down on, but no more than today.   It's more than about simple over-eating. It's certainly not evolutionary. The appestat is somehow fucked, from multiple factors."
OldSchoolCool,3di94t,Made_in_Boston,5,Thu Jul 16 18:08:13 2015 UTC,Msg isn't bad for you and in no way leads to obesity.
OldSchoolCool,3di94t,Bacon666,3,Thu Jul 16 17:06:25 2015 UTC,"I was a kid back then and there were tons (literally) of fat people.  They weren't on TV or photos so much, but there were lots.  I think the shittiest diets ever were from the 1960s - 1980s.  Convenience foods like McDonalds and hot pockets were kind of novel and cool and lots of people ate this garbage.  I seem to remember in the early 90s a resurgence of healthy diets and rejection of fast/frozen food. So when you see these photo essays from decades ago and think people were so much thinner then, remember, you're looking at the people that they decided to photograph.  In a way, you're looking at subtle, but widespread fat-shaming by omission."
OldSchoolCool,3di94t,woozy99,0,Thu Jul 16 17:54:29 2015 UTC,"There were some shitty diets before, and in, the 60's.  But the people on them were not even close to being as fat as now.    With continuous womens ""vanity sizing"", a size 10 in the 60's was like a 2-4 now. A size 12 was considered undesirable, which was only a 6-8 by todays standards..   Jackie Gleason and Kate Smith were 1940's to mid-50's. I swear, I think people started getting fat the year the TV dinner was invented. Did you know they use sugar (now HFCS) to prevent freezer burn? Hot Pockets weren't introduced till 1983. That was probably the beginning of the end.  I didn't know a single fat person in the 60's. Not that many in the 70's. But by the 80's, uh oh... creeping lard.  I didn't get this from photos, or a photo essay, I was alive in the 50's, (Holy Shit)."

OldSchoolCool,3di9tc,lordtuto,3,Thu Jul 16 16:53:40 2015 UTC,It wasn't the embargo that changed the future of this shop. Once the new government came into power they most likely immediately seized the shop and nationalized it. Since there wasn't really a need to sell motorcycles I'm sure it was closed down and converted into something else
OldSchoolCool,3di9tc,ElTacoNaco,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:08:50 2015 UTC,I was thinking since they're American products they'd surely be banned - at least new ones anyway.
OldSchoolCool,3di9tc,lordtuto,2,Thu Jul 16 19:00:36 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't be banned because they are American products necessarily. It's like if you see photos of the cars being driven around Cuba today, they are all 50s and 60s models of mostly American-made vehicles. Granted, the Soviet Union imported a lot since the embargo was in place but American products are still there"
OldSchoolCool,3di9tc,ElTacoNaco,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:26:51 2015 UTC,"Well yea, Cuba is famous for its old cars, but what I was getting at is that the import of new cars and Harleys would be banned. Not that the old stuff would be collected and destroyed. But I think Cuba was pretty reliant on US imports, no? Lol I was thinking of a Cuban self-embargo, but that's just plain wrong."
OldSchoolCool,3di9tc,lordtuto,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:06:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah it would definitely be banned. At least, as long as it is a US company. Before the revolution, many argue that Cuba was effectively a puppet of the US. A lot of the biggest and oldest companies in the US now all had businesses in Cuba so when all of that disappeared, the economy of Cuba changed. That's the reason they needed subsidies from the Soviet Union and then more recently China"
OldSchoolCool,3di9tc,ElTacoNaco,2,Thu Jul 16 21:13:20 2015 UTC,Wait an hour ago you said they wouldn't be banned.
OldSchoolCool,3di9tc,lordtuto,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:19:31 2015 UTC,I was saying that US imports in to Cuba would be banned.
OldSchoolCool,3di9tc,markincuba,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:45:57 2015 UTC,"More accurately:  the USA banned exports to Cuba. Cuba did not ban imports from the USA.  Nationalization of US-owned businesses occurred in retaliation for the US refusing to refine imported Soviet oil in US-owned refineries. Tit-for-tat measures quickly led the US to cut off it's sugar contracts with Cuba (pretty much the only export product Cuba produced, a huge blow to its national accounts) forcing it into an economic alliance with the Soviet Union and resulting in the US embargo, which - despite recently renewed diplomatic missions between the two countries - continues to apply, restricting the sale of products of US origin to Cuba. The embargo is so much larger than just ""not selling US stuff to Cuba"". It's a far-reaching economic stranglehold that includes global financial blockades (Google US bank and Cuba and fine), a ban on ships that visited Cuba continuing on to US ports for a 6-month period, etc."
OldSchoolCool,3di9tc,lordtuto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:39:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right. Just wasn't thinking of it that way as ban of import/export.   Also, based off your username, are you really redditting from Cuba?"

OldSchoolCool,3dep5e,wisesonAC,366,Wed Jul 15 18:09:41 2015 UTC,I've never seen a drinking fountain work that well. Whenever I use one the water has pathetic pressure and is sometimes unusable. There must have been a golden age of water fountain technology and I've missed it : (  Edit: Also I noticed that with a bit more water pressure that fountain would shoot directly into a power outlet. Perhaps an incident like that contributed to the end of the golden age of public water delivery.
OldSchoolCool,3dep5e,inorganicmechanic,359,Wed Jul 15 19:01:20 2015 UTC,"After segregation of water fountains ended, rather than let black people drink out of the better working white fountains, they made all water fountains into the crappier blacks-only fountains.  /history"
OldSchoolCool,3dep5e,ArtSchnurple,272,Wed Jul 15 20:37:40 2015 UTC,"You joke, but that was actually was a thing.  Jerry ""Reno"" Riggins of Mississippi owned Southern Nozzle Works - which is the company that had the patent on that distinct water fountain button/shield/water nozzle thing that's on all the water fountains.  It was a family business that started out selling their wares school by school and eventually ended up with their products in place everywhere that water fountains were.  If it weren't for this black mark on their history, I'm sure more people would have heard of it.  Jerry wasn't just a businessman, he was a Mississippi politician and a highly ranked member of the KKK.  When the feds came around and started enforcing integration, he vowed to take action.  The first thing that he did was to demand that all water fountains in integrated schools be taken down.  He was quickly sued by the state of Minnesota and eventually ordered by the supreme court to replace the water fountains.  These nozzles, you see, are all molded.  The casts used to mold them were hand-made.  Way back then there were no such things as CNC mills - tooling was done by hand and there was no other way to get it done.  He went in and welded a piece of wire coat hanger into each and every mold.  He complied with the court order, but he had all of his company's nozzle's replaced with the now-broken version.  The FBI got involved at some point and determined that there was no way to replace or re-manufacture the original equipment.  Jerry had not only broken virtually every water fountain nation wide because of his stance on integration, he had done it in a way that couldn't be undone - then or anytime really since.  This example of a poorly thought out execution of an idea is where the term ""Jerry Rigged"" comes from (Jerry Riggins = Jerry Rigged).  Funny enough, the Disney intellectual property lobbying that keeps Mickey Mouse from going into the public domain is the exact same lobbying that keeps Southern Nozzle Works in business as one of the few real monopolies left in the United States.  When Mickey Mouse goes public we will have good water fountains everywhere again."

OldSchoolCool,3djvw8,Sergeant_Fancypants,3,Thu Jul 16 21:28:21 2015 UTC,"This is a publicity still for Clara Bow's first talkie, The Wild Party, directed by Dorothy Arzner.   Bow is considered the first modern film sex symbol. She survived a horrific childhood, became a major superstar, and then retired before her 30th birthday to raise kids in Nevada with her husband, cowboy actor Rex Bell. She hated talkies, found them limiting, and her emotional fragility made her a constant target of abuse by Hollywood executives and tabloids---she chose to retire for these reasons.  Dorothy Arzner was an early female film director, one of the few who found success working within the studio system. She was intensely private and slightly eccentric; she was known for dressing in male fashions and had several relationships with female actresses over the years. She is believed to have invented the boom mike---when Bow became nervous and stressed over having to stand still and talk into a microphone, Arzner attached the microphone to a fishing pole and suspended it above her head so she could move freely while acting. Clara was known for being a very physical, energetic actress in silent films and this innovation allowed her to continue her style in early sound films."

OldSchoolCool,3de14n,FineAsABeesWing,9,Wed Jul 15 22:20:43 2015 UTC,"He was born  in Belfast in 1868 to a ship carpenter with Harland and Wolff and a housewife. He joined the British Army in 1886 at the age of 18.  Deployed to India with the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars from 1887 to 1889 and then returned to Britain where he had four children.  In 1900 he deployed to Africa to fight in the Second Boer War from 1900 to 1902, again with the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars.  He was promoted and transferred to the 5th Royal Irish Lancers in 1901 during the war.  According to pension records, he left service as a Farrier Sergeant with the 5th Royal Irish Lancers in 1908 after 22 years.    He re-enlisted in 1914 at the outbreak of WWI and was assigned to the Royal Irish Fusiliers (Princess Victoria's). He landed at Gallipoli in the Dardanelles on August 7th 1915.  His unit had 788 men at that time and they were withdrawn on September 30th with 393 men after heavy fighting, rampant disease and malnutrition.  They were subsequently deployed to the Balkans and Palestine for a time and eventually transferred to France in 1918 where they fought for six months.  At the of the end of the war on November 11, 1918 he was on the border of Belgium.    My great great grandfather died sometime in 1947 in Belfast.  He had withdrawn from the family and the last contact anyone had with him was in 1944, despite the fact that many of his relatives lived within walking distance of him.  He was said to suffer from ""tremors"".  Nowadays, we'd call that PTSD.  One of his sons became an officer in the British Army and died fighting Italian forces in East Africa in 1941.  His other son was an iron worker for Harland and Wolff and helped build the Titanic and her sister ships and later emigrated to the United States.  His remaining son and daughter emigrated to the United States after WWI.    Edit: detail"

He was then in the Free State Army and died in the early 1920s as a result of mustard gas poisoning in WWI. We have a big framed picture of him in my parent's house, somewhere in the attic, and we used to have quite a few engraved artillery shells and other stuff, along with a cap like the one in your picture made out of the bottom of a shell with his gold cap-badge mounted on it.

The Spanish and the Americans were also using them at that time for conflicts that they were involved in, so it's hard to tell who can lay claim to being the first nation to uproot a civilian populace and intern them.  The British aim was to cut off the supply of food, water and weapons to the Boer fighters by removing the civilians as the primary source.  It worked with horrific  effectiveness and combined with a scorched earth policy of burning every Boer house, farm and village to the ground, effectively destroyed the Boer ""nation"".  They also shipped nearly every Boer fighter they caught to colonies overseas.    Edit: spelling"

The aesthetic is sometimes described as one of beauty that is ""imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete"".  It is a concept derived from the Buddhist teaching of the three marks of existence (三法印, sanbōin ?), specifically impermanence (無常, mujō ?), the other two being suffering (苦, ku ?) and emptiness or absence of self-nature (空, kū ?).  Characteristics of the wabi-sabi aesthetic include asymmetry, asperity (roughness or irregularity), simplicity, economy, austerity, modesty, intimacy, and appreciation of the ingenuous integrity of natural objects and processes.    Image i - Zen garden of Ryōan-ji. It was built during the Higashiyama period　The clay wall, which is stained by age with subtle brown and orange tones, reflects ""wabi"" and the rock garden ""sabi"".

That's like saying that straight men who enjoy anal sex with women should enjoy it with other men too.  Also, butch/femme relationships were very common back in the day as they could 'pass' as hetero couples and avoid trouble on the street. Most butches these days just reject femininity, and I don't see that as particularly 'manly'. A woman doesn't stop being a woman when she acts in a way that isn't 'acceptable' for women.  I guess it can be difficult for non-gay people to understand, but hopefully I've helped to shed some light on a little bit of lesbian culture."

He only won presidency because had a skin disease that made him look tan on color televisions.  Then his family got fucked over like some kind of weird curse.  But the virgin on Reddit says he's lucky cause a woman who was raped repeatedly in her industry eventually was a part of a rumor that they had sex. I really don't like people. I really think people like you are so stupid you deserve to be in a dark room with no stimulation and a bag over your head until you just starve or something, then let you out.

She did a lot as far as charity goes to help children and was, by all accounts, a genuinely nice and (despite the roles she played) intelligent person. You know she was one of the early civil rights advocates? That she helped Ella Fitzgerald's career by getting her booked in a famous ""whites-only"" club? Or that she was the first celebrity to openly talk about sexual abuse and bring it out in the open? Know anything about the small things she did off-screen to help women and push for equal rights? Do you know anything other than you hate her because she is Marilyn Monroe?   She grew up poor, had a schizophrenic mother, and was sexually assaulted multiple times when she was a child- so, yeah, she had mental issues. And, this will probably surprise you, but the mental health scene in the 50's wasn't exactly top notch, no matter how much money you had to spend. Even with today's medicine, many people with mental disorders turn to drugs- not because they're weak or pathetic, but because they just want to feel good for once."

They then had her read for the part of Bubba, but felt that she wasn't ""black"" or ""male"" enough. Finally they eventually cast her as Forrest's mom, despite her being only ten years older than Tom Hanks.

OldSchoolCool,3daryu,Clrmiok,2,Wed Jul 15 20:03:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Yes many people responsible for horrible crimes had good times and maybe loved their Moms and fed a kitten once. We can't define them totally by that anymore than by their horrible deeds. If we don't take ALL aspects of that person in measure then we do not truly define who and what they are. They are ALL of these things, and in my mind the bad outweighs the good. If I'm inviting a former killer into my home, I'd rather know he'd killed before than he's given some orphans some food or made a beautiful work of art. It's how we survive, knowing the good and the bad. The good things won't harm us, their bad deeds just might."

OldSchoolCool,3d7g36,BeertjeBombazijn,9,Tue Jul 14 04:20:53 2015 UTC,"she was very thin throughout her whole life, ever since she was a child during the nazi occupation of the netherlands. being a ballerina, it was her natural build, compound that with the malnutrition and anemia she suffered throughout the war, she retained a very svelte appearance throughout her adult life. the photograph i posted is a candid - no plan for lighting or makeup - so maybe her skin isn't as smooth as you'd like, or her expression isn't so perfectly timed. sorry to crush your dreams, but this is what one of the most beautiful women in history looked like when she wasn't expecting the camera - to me, still one of the most beautiful women in history.  your standards must be unimaginably high for this picture to turn you off, to say she looks like she's on meth. i have no personal relationship or history with audrey hepburn, but to me she's an international symbal of elegance and grace, and also of fortitude and kindness and bravery. if there's anything here that's glaringly classless, it's your crude remarks.  and this sub isn't even about hotness or your personal preferences or whatever. it's about old. school. cool. and she looks fly as fuck in this photo."

Some facts:  • My mother has since past away, she was taken by cancer in 2010.  • Also, I am a man.  Not a girl. And the idea that I am also a beautiful ballet dancer, the same as my mother.... Well I am a guy. So I obviously look similar to my mother, but not the same, and or in the way you'd like. • I would also like to thank all the people who were respectful of my mother and downvoted comments that were otherwise. I appreciate the kind words and I'm sure she'd like it too.  • yes, I pimped my mom for karma. I don't feel bad about it, though.  • I understand that it's a generally bad idea to post pictures of your mother to Reddit. But I think this is a cool picture, that is fairly old; and so Wanted to share it.  *Thanks for the karma. :) *  Old comment: It's okay! I deleted my comment telling of that. I don't want this to be overwhelmed by pity.  I don't necessarily prefer gross sexual harassment towards my mother.... But whatever. I knew it was coming."

OldSchoolCool,3d1fkg,ashleythelma,6,Sun Jul 12 21:58:23 2015 UTC,"My favourite yoga instructor was a former professional ballet dancer.  Shipped off to dance school in the US at 16, we talked a little about the dance styles she was exposed to.  She was very reserved about her ability, but once in a while if you blinked you'd miss her do something.  I found her really emotive, and she had an extremely good memory - she once scolded us for not mentioning to her that she forgot a pose on one side the previous week.  I'm curious how similar her and your mom are, but you being her kid - you probably got away with more than we did."

I'm gay btw, so there ain't nuthin' sexual going on here. Just admiring a truly beautiful example of human grace. But seriously dude/dudette, your mom was insanely beautiful."

OldSchoolCool,3d1fkg,Hapoi83,140,Sun Jul 12 23:26:21 2015 UTC,Nah. It's funny. And she was a ballerina for like... Ever. When she was in her 50's she was still choreographing and teaching.

OldSchoolCool,3d1fkg,papabattaglia,10,Sun Jul 12 22:42:12 2015 UTC,"How cool. Ballet is always so amazing to watch. I don't particularly care for the style. It makes me feel less than some others, but the discipline, dedication, skill, and athleticism required is just amazing. I did ballet until my boobs posed a problem. Then I broke a foot and knee and couldn't dance the same. I just wanted to be a ballerina. My name is Lorena (rhymes with ballerina), so it just seemed like fate.   Anyway, I rambled. Your mom looks stunning, and I'm sure she's still a beautiful woman with the spirit of a dancer. Thank you for sharing."

It cost me a double bypass at age 60.  And that obesity does not have to happen. We are not condemned by nature to grow obese. The secret is proper nutrition and that means avoiding sugar, starches (think all flour products, including cold breakfast cereal) and HFCS. The above are appetite stimulating and trick people into overeating. Once they are eliminated, appetite returns to what is necessary for life.  I currently weigh 165, swim two miles most days and lift in the gym. Life is much better when one is right size.

He'd look like a basketball with legs when the snow first started falling and by the time it stayed on the ground he would set up shop in a shed and snooze for a month at a time, coming out to hang on warm days. Crazy smart + thumbs = bad pet IMHO. The fucker could figure out those child proof cabinet thingys in like a week. It was kinda fun watching him figure stuff out though. He figured out a peanut butter jar in two days, wrapping his back legs around the jar and using his front paws to unscrew the top.

We have a hinged little canister for the cat food. Well we noticed it every time we went to feed it standing there watching us, so one day we hear a door open and close...didn't think anything of it till we couldn't find our cat for food time. He was laying in the food relaxing. We thought it was a single occurrence but it happened again and after awhile the other cats would wait outside the door while he walked in and he would grab some food with his mouth, come out the door and throw it on the ground for the others."

In modern times, the kirpan may be wrapped in cloth so that it cannot be withdrawn from the scabbard, so it is not considered  to be a weapon. On the other hand, here in Canada, some of the older men will on special occasions wear a full size sword in public.   Jim B."

In the top third of this image, prominently displayed, is General Lee's Battle flag. The Flag of the Army of Northern Virginia (thank you /u/ISBN_10_00914171801).  I apologize that you were expecting more of a discussion on 1945 Okinawa, however, given the caption and the subsequent image, I don't blame people for discussing the flag and its context rather than the battle and its context.  Another way I view this image is that many of our southern citizens continued and continue to fight for the United States. Is the image implying, ""We're still here. You haven't defeated us."", or ""I'm representing my heritage."", or something else?"

OldSchoolCool,3d4bac,Aethelric,2,Tue Jul 14 16:07:36 2015 UTC,"The salient characteristic of the Confederate leadership has to be stupidity. Stupidity because they chose war before they exhausted the legal opportunity to sue in the Supreme Court for confirmation of their Tenth Amendment right to secede. The Tenth Amendment reserves all rights not assigned to Congress to the States and the People.  They also showed their stupidity by refusing to sell cotton when they needed the money to buy arms and provisions.   And Lee's reliance on the frontal assault, no matter what the cost in blood, also shows a lack of intellectual capacity. What was he doing at Gettysburg? Why did he risk his army for a few hills? What would he have done with those hills if the Union army retreated to another set of hills?"

Also the South tried to export cotton but ran into difficulties what with there being a U.S. Navy in the way.   Also explain to me how Chancerlorsville, the entire Valley Campaign, Second Bull Run or the defense against the Overland Campaign relied upon frontal assault.   I'll agree that Lee is overrated, and Malvern Hill and Gettysburg showcase him at his least innovative, but there were precious few truly innovative commanders on either side (there were several on both, but a minority) but Lee wasn't a bad general"

I was able to make out most of the text, which I've transcribed below (it seems as though he duplicated what he wrote in case one was lost or taken). Incredible to see how hard he tried to make sure he'd have a record. This is essentially all I've ever seen about his time in the service, so I don't have much more detail other than his Selective Service Notice of Classification (which I haven't posted).  I have a couple of questions, in addition to some text I can't make out - just in case there's anyone out there who's familiar with these sort of things. Anybody heard of the two boats he traveled on? Can't seem to unearth much online.  I'm also going to look into making a map that tracked his movements. Maybe even one day taking a trip following his footsteps!  Here's what I was able to make out:  Went over January 18th, 1944 on S.S.

Spend some time at a costume museum and you'll see just that; wedding dresses conform to the silhouette of women's fashions. After the miniskirt trend of the 1960s came the backlash of the 70s with long floor-length skirts becoming in vogue and the neo-Victorian revival in bridal wear. Wedding dresses have been long, fancy and formal ever since."

My escort hobby is kind of the perfect solution with getting to know a thinking mind and a warm heart, Escorting is a very special way of dating. One can be extremely direct and honest, as there are no connections to mutual past or future, and therefore no need to keep up pretense or facades. Instead one can bevery naked as a human existence in the present, and suddenly experience that we all have much more in common than what differs between us. I think it is more fun to have a real partner, since I also get a kick out of being able to give pleasure to another, and I crave to coze and cuddle once in a while."

OldSchoolCool,3cwdd4,Nathanmcd4122,26,Sat Jul 11 16:45:59 2015 UTC,"Medical billing in the US is like the sticker price on a new car.  Nobody pays it, it's just a negotiating point.  For almost all medical procedures involving a length hospital stay, you either have insurance, in which case the insurance company negotiates a much lower fee for themselves and a smallish copayment from the patient, or you don't pay at all, go bankrupt, and the hospital and doctors make up for it by overcharging other, insured patients.  Fortunately, more than 90% of Americans have insurance, and the number is rising."

OldSchoolCool,3cwdd4,Eplore,7,Sat Jul 11 20:21:14 2015 UTC,Places like the hospital I work at constantly offer financial assistance.. So about 95% are going to get a coverage to pay for them whether they like it or not and the hospital has an adjustment percentage for these procedures. Of course their is that 5% that slip under the rug and get sent to our debt collection department that get tracked down frickin mercilessly.
OldSchoolCool,3cwdd4,rivalpancakes,164,Sat Jul 11 20:29:52 2015 UTC,"Insurance covered all but about $1000... we (luckily) have really good insurance through my employer.  edit: I should also note that the insurance company paid about $900,000 after ""discounts"" which would not be given to a normal citizen.  Basically if you don't have insurance and don't qualify for Medicaid, you're totally screwed and would have to declare bankruptcy.  USA! USA!  edit 2: just to qualify in response to various people below criticizing me... my comments have nothing to do with the amazing individual medical professionals involved, in particular the high risk OB/GYN who was somehow able to detect the heart condition at twenty weeks of gestation and the genius pediatric cardiac surgeon who was able to reroute the circulation on a three-day old baby heart.  truly amazing.  doesn't mean the financial aspect of the system isn't jacked up."

They changed this rule, didn't tell me, then made me come into the office in my own time--unpaid!--and ""correct my charting"" by changing all patient names in my narrative to ""consumer"". How to correct this: 1. Find a black ball-point pen. Using a blue or non-ball point pen was illegal, they said. (It's not.) 2. Draw one straight line through the illegal word (the patient's first name). 3. Write word ""consumer"" above illegal word. 3. Write date of correction and initials next to line just drawn. 4. Go home all pissed off about idiotic managers changing rules without notification and mandatory charting changes and unpaid time. 5.

OldSchoolCool,3cwdd4,snaab900,4,Sat Jul 11 19:14:03 2015 UTC,Yeah totally. I wouldn't give a shit about going bankrupt if it's a life or death thing. But don't the hospitals ask if you've got insurance when you get admitted?
OldSchoolCool,3cwdd4,_Z_E_R_O,9,Sat Jul 11 19:23:12 2015 UTC,"Nope. They treat first, ask question later, then send the bill.  If a patient has insurance they send it on to their company which will pay for some (but rarely all) of the cost, if they don't they are at the hospital's mercy to negotiate a lower price (which most hospitals are willing to do). If you're truly poor and qualify for assistance the government will pick up the tab. Hospitals are willing to work with patients who can't pay, because some form of payment is better than no form of payment."
OldSchoolCool,3cwdd4,MLE_r33d,6,Sat Jul 11 22:17:59 2015 UTC,Not if you are in a critical condition. They don't just turn you away with a stab wound because you don't have insurance.
OldSchoolCool,3cwdd4,Showmeyourcupcakes,2,Sat Jul 11 22:25:44 2015 UTC,"They ask for insurance, but will still treat you if you don't have it.  My boyfriend has tons of medical debt that he never paid, and it has not really affected him much at all.  A good chunk of it was because he was stabbed by a mugger--and it fucking sucks that he would have to pay that enormous hospital bill for a crime that was committed against him (he didn't have insurance at the time--couldn't afford it, and of course they never caught the mugger...).    So, he gets calls from collections a lot and that's about it.  He's never had to file for bankruptcy or anything.  His credit blows, but neither of us are interested in buying a car or house or getting credit cards sooo, he basically just said fuck it and refused to pay."
OldSchoolCool,3cwdd4,Tropicwhimper,5,Sun Jul 12 04:35:07 2015 UTC,"Holy shit. Were you in the hospital for an extended period with lots of complications? My son had the procedure last year. The surgery, along with 5 weeks of hospital stay was $250,000. Eta: my son qualified for a non-income based form of Medicaid for children with disabilities so we luckily don't pay a dime for his medical care."
OldSchoolCool,3cwdd4,platetone,2,Sat Jul 11 19:50:43 2015 UTC,"No.  It took him a long time to learn to eat, so really the bulk of that four weeks was the NICU recovery stay (still less than your five weeks @ $250K, though).  The NICU charged something like $30K a day.  This is Medical City in Dallas, considered one of the most expensive for-profit hospitals in the country, but they have one of the best pediatric cardiac surgeons (and they're less than ten minutes from where we live)."
OldSchoolCool,3cwdd4,Tropicwhimper,2,Sat Jul 11 21:53:59 2015 UTC,That's really wild. My son had two separate stays. One three week stay immediately after birth where he had to learn to eat and then he returned for two weeks at 11 weeks old when his heart failed and he had emergency surgery. He also has Down syndrome and there were some other complications. Our local hospital is considered a top pediatric cardiology hospital but it is public so we were very lucky. How is your son doing today? Does he need any more surgery?
OldSchoolCool,3cwdd4,Tropicwhimper,2,Wed Jul 15 10:41:16 2015 UTC,Also my son was not in the NICU which I'm sure made a huge difference in price. He was there for a couple nights and then was transferred to a cardiac step down unit. It is funny that it was cheaper because he got his own room and I could stay overnight!

It amazes me sometimes, thinking what could have been for some people if they had not been crushed by medical debt.  Here, you don't just recover from an illness or accident. You are at the mercy of a for-profit businesses, not your doctor, with the power to decide which kind of medication you should have. Doctor prescribes name brand over a generic because the coating of the generic pill gives you horrible diarrhea or other side effects? Too bad, you're getting the generic for $30. Or they'll ""approve"" your doctor's petition and ""cover"" the name brand...$10 off the $600 prescription.   Fuck, the U.S. is just seriously terribly fucked up in regards to health.

OldSchoolCool,3cwdd4,rufaterd,5,Sat Jul 11 18:08:04 2015 UTC,"Here's one story of that account:   Dr. John Leinhard is a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Houston. He writes one article in the late 80's that states:   The slave population in the American colonies reached a maximum of a quarter-million in 1754. But it dropped off as we approached, and fought, the Revolutionary war. For a while, people thought slavery might die out entirely.  But technology intervened. Eli Whitney patented the cotton gin in 1793. Suddenly we could turn a profit on this terribly labor-intensive crop. From then until the Civil War the slave population increased to the astonishing level of 4,000,000.  The grand irony of all this is that the person who provided Whitney with the key idea for his gin was himself a slave, known to us only by the name Sam. Sam's father had solved the critical problem of removing seeds from cotton by developing a kind of comb to do the job. Whitney's cotton gin simply mechanized this comb.   So this is the story referred to in the previous post. But Dr. Leinhard writes another article several years later, one that quotes more recent and deeper research on the cotton gin - and in the postscript, he writes:    Apocryphal credit for Whitney's cotton gin idea is often given to either of two people: a slave named Sam whose father had given the idea to him, and Catharine Greene, widow of Revolutionary War General Nathaniel Greene and owner of the South Caroline plantation.   So, it sounds like the story is apocryphal."
OldSchoolCool,3cwdd4,ProNoob95,10,Sat Jul 11 17:25:10 2015 UTC,"Eli Whitney was white. I think I remembered that by thinking ""Of course a white guy wanted to make slaves more efficient"""
OldSchoolCool,3cwdd4,lavars,21,Sat Jul 11 17:28:42 2015 UTC,I thought Eli Whitney created the cotton gin to reducd the need for slave labor.
OldSchoolCool,3cwdd4,KrispyKing420,19,Sat Jul 11 18:44:05 2015 UTC,"You're right, the fact that it lead to the horrific consequence of increasing demand for slaves was something he didn't anticipate."
OldSchoolCool,3cwdd4,special_reddit,11,Sat Jul 11 18:54:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember that as being kind of a bummer story from history lessons. Essentially he wanted to devise a way where plantations could harvest and clean the same amount of cotton as they were at the time, but with a fraction of the workforce. Instead, plantation owners took it as a way to double or even triple the size of their farms and thus profits while only marginally increasing their slave labor force. IIRC the original cotton gins were ridiculously dangerous too and often manned by women and children.  Kind of a slap in the face, but that's American capitalism at its finest- find a way to make it easy on the impoverished and the rich will always try to take advantage :("
OldSchoolCool,3cwdd4,Downvotesturnmeonbby,3,Sat Jul 11 16:21:16 2015 UTC,"Not according to Andrea Lakwete, author of Inventing the Cotton Gin: Machine and Myth in Antebellum America.   An article based on her work states that:   The earliest cotton gin consisted of a flat stone slab and a skinny hardwood roller. Lay cotton on the slab and grasp each end of the roller. As you roll it over the cotton, the seeds are spit out in front of it. Of course that takes both muscle and skill.  Medieval China and India greatly improved that method with pairs of crank-driven rollers -- like the old washing machine wringer. Then, foot treadles, gearing, flywheels, even water power, were later added to those roller gins. As school children, most of us learned that Eli Whitney took us from picking out seeds by hand, to industrial gins in one step. That clearly did not happen.  Whitney, a bright young Yale graduate, had been given a letter of introduction to a widow, a plantation owner, in South Carolina. There he was to tutor her children. In the process, he struck up a friendship with another Yale graduate, Phineas Miller, who'd previously tutored the children. Lakwete tells us that Whitney and Miller found people concerned with the ginning problem. Whitney came up with the idea of a gin that worked by passing wire claws through cotton to pull it free of its seeds.   Two takeaways here:   1) Eli Whitney only invented the industrial cotton gin. Mechanical separation of seeds from cotton had been around long before Whitney.   2) No mention of slavery concerns. Not trying to make a more equitable America, just building a better mousetrap."

They spent months getting evaluations and basically they were told there were only 2 surgeons in the world that could perform the surgery his son needed. The one surgeon was in Japan and the other was Dr. Ben Carson. The cost of the surgery was over $200K and luckily for my brothers friend the military picked up the cost. The day of the surgery Dr. Carson met with the family one last time and as Dr. Carson started to head back to prep for the surgery my brothers friend said to Dr. Carson, ""I really hope you are as a good as they say you are."" Without missing a beat Dr. Carson stopped and turned to him and said, ""I'm even better than they say I am"" and smiled. A few hours later his son was out of surgery and on his way to recovery.

OldSchoolCool,3cwdd4,ripewdecay,8,Sat Jul 11 18:17:33 2015 UTC,"Section 5. Decisive surgery of article  Vivien Thomas:       On November 29, 1944, the procedure was first tried on an eighteen-month-old infant named Eileen Saxon.  The blue baby syndrome had made her lips and fingers turn blue, with the rest of her skin having a very faint blue tinge. She could only take a few steps before beginning to breathe heavily. Because no instruments for cardiac surgery then existed, Thomas adapted the needles and clamps for the procedure from those in use in the animal lab.  During the surgery itself, at Blalock's request, Thomas stood on a step stool at Blalock's shoulder and coached him step by step through the procedure.  Thomas performed the operation hundreds of times on a dog, whereas Blalock only once as Thomas' assistant.  The surgery was not completely successful, though it did prolong the infant's life for several months.  Blalock and his team operated again on an 11-year-old girl, this time with complete success, and the patient was able to leave the hospital three weeks after the surgery.  Next, they operated upon a six-year-old boy, who dramatically regained his color at the end of the surgery.  The three cases formed the basis for the article that was published in the May 1945 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, giving credit to Blalock and Taussig for the procedure. Thomas received no mention.      Relevant: Vivien T. Thomas Medical Arts Academy | Alfred Blalock | Something the Lord Made | Blalock–Taussig shunt   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.
