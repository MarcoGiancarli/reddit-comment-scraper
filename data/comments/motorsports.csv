I live a couple of hours from that place (Rudskogen is pretty much the only ""proper"" car racetrack in southern Norway). Cant believe I missed it.  Fast cars, or just cars in general, are really expensive in Norway, so seeing some of these cars in a track setting over here (or just at all.

You rent a car (I suggest Rent Race Car, they are located directly at the gates of the Nurburgring Nordschliefe). I didn't bring a helmet and they don't rent them out. The car has a half-cage so it's technically not required although I would've liked one. You have to rent a ""race car"", do NOT take a regular rental car on the track.

For example, the Swift was insured. I would have to pay the first €5000 in damages and they covered the rest, PLUS I would have to pay for any repairs to the track and covering marshalls cost for coming out. Crashing gets QUITE expensive. And I asked them, they write off about 8 cars per year. A guy was still in the hospital from rolling his car into the armco a few days before I rented!"

I mean, yes that is true but thats not really the heart of the issue with motorsports on TV. NASCAR, for whatever reason, became so dominant that SPEED couldn't cover anything else at all. WRC and F1 coverage was pretty great before it went mostly NASCAR. Now we are running into similiar problems amongst the splintered channels. NBC covered F1 ok at first, but lately its become almost unbearable. The world feeds from FOM dont make much sense. The announcers are meh. WRC footage is completely gone. The 24hours of LeMans coverage was pretty terrible. So, to me saying "" the only fix we had was a fix"" seems redundant. Of course splitting it up saved it, but it seems media, at least in the US, dont really know how to cover it."

I feel like I should be more excited about this than I am.   I guess a lot of it for me is the fact that I've never found the smaller cars as interesting. It gets a little boring for me when everyone is running the same variations of tiny three door hatchbacks because they're the only thing viable under the current rules. I'd far prefer to see the return of larger four door platforms than another 80BHP in the current cars.

motorsports,3d697n,Clarence_Moose,2,Tue Jul 14 19:33:14 2015 UTC,"Ride heights, damper speeds, steering angles... they're basically all things that you'd need to purchase and install specific sensors for. The expandable nature of the higher-end AiM systems (MXL/MXG/Evo4) systems are necessary for this sort of data.  All of my answers assume you'd be installing this on a supported car/ECU where the AiM system can read CAN-bus data, not installing individual sensors for each data channel."
motorsports,3d697n,Clarence_Moose,2,Tue Jul 14 20:23:26 2015 UTC,"My list of desires are for laptimes, driver inputs(throttle position, brake position, possibly steering angle), Engine management(speed and RPM at a location on a track, shift points), as well as monitoring my water/oil temperature readers and to have obvious alarms that would warn me to back off some.  Do you think the MXG would be necessary for this application?  I dont plan on having sensors for rideheight/damper speeds. I don't know much about CAN-bus, but yes it will be on a ECU supported car (350z).  please excuse my lack of terminology, learning as I go."
motorsports,3d697n,B96v6,2,Tue Jul 14 22:42:21 2015 UTC,"So I did a little googling: http://www.aim-sportline.com/download/ecu/stock/nissan/Nissan350Z_2006-2009_105_eng.pdf Presumably this document (page 4 in particular) contains the CAN data you could obtain through your ECU or OBDII port. You should be able to obtain all of this with the just the SoloDL, but there are some limitations:   First, the two switches, brake and oil pressure, are probably binary... just on or off - so you would know when/where you're braking, or when/where you have adequate (or poor) oil pressure, but you wouldn't have an exact brake pedal position or pressure value. For exact values on those you'd need something like the MXL/MXG/Evo4 where you could wire direct to a sensor. Second, I don't believe the SoloDL supports live monitoring of ECU data, so if you want to use this device in place of your dash gauges, then yeah, you're looking at a full dash like the MXL or MXG.   I like the suggestion in another post about finding a used MXL system. A few months back I saw a used Evo4 w/ MXL display listed for $1000. Very tempting, but unfortunately wasn't in my budget at the time. Just a note, AiM-sportline is the international website for AiM... they do tend to have more current information than the US site (aimsports.com), just don't make the assumption that everything on that site 100% applies to you or your vehicle. For instance, maybe there are some differences between European and North American 350Z ECUs... I don't know."

The software is also easy to use and would be great way to learn how to analyze the data you are getting. The amount of information you get is mind-blowing and being able to look at to quickly will help you get a leg up on your competition. If you don't have experience using data systems, jumping straight to a Motec system would not be a good idea. They can be difficult to use because they are so capable; and be prepared to pay for it. Another good thing about Aim is its wide usage. You'll be able get good laps from people willing to share and overlay your laps to see where you can improve."

motorsports,3ccp2a,CDRWilson,4,Tue Jul 7 03:08:50 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. It depends on the Motorsport in question. I think the GT series are directly reflected by their consumer equivalents.   Example is the Porsche's 918 and GT2/3, the 918 hybrid system was developed from their racing counter part while the 911 GTs are an ever refinement from their racing brethren.  Ford's fiesta and focus have a lot of development from their rally counter part.  As far as F1, Indy, and NASCAR have lost that part of the sport and it's all about making money and sponsorships."
motorsports,3ccp2a,thebrownbomber,8,Tue Jul 7 16:58:26 2015 UTC,"Motor racing stopped being about advancements in automotive technology decades ago.  Manufacturers are ramping up developments in engines, drivetrains, suspensions, even in-car infotainment systems at a far greater rate than their counterparts in the racing shops.  Gone are the days when disk brakes, turbochargers, fuel injection, and even diesels took a trip to Indy or Le Mans on the way to showroom.    Now, it's the other way around.  NASCAR brought in fuel injection only a few years ago, after six decades of carburetors.  INDYCAR requires that its teams use the same engine for multiple races, before returning them to the manufacturer for freshening.  Today, ""parity,"" a ""level playing field,"" and ""entertainment value"" are more important than technical advancements, to the point that any advantage that a team acquires through R&D is quickly outlawed and the team branded as ""cheaters.""  It's all about the show.  Tight packs, lots of passing, and matinee-idol drivers -- that's what matters in racing nowadays.  It's a different world from when I was a kid.  I'm not entirely sure, however, if it's a better one."

motorsports,3cbrwv,schrodingersBox,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:03:37 2015 UTC,"Tough but fair. If the ACO/FIA cant be confident that the engines were not tampered with, then this is the only option and the explanation of the penalty is satisfactory for me.   Not saying that Audi cheated or were even attempting to cheat, but rules are rules. This reminds me of what happened with the #45 Flying Lizard car at Mosport couple of years ago. One of the seals on the engine restrictor air box failed or came loose due to contact in the race. Even though post race tech agreed that it did not give them any additional performance, they were stripped of their win.  I dont think this is that big a deal for Audi. If one engine can survive practice, qualy, and the race at Lemans, thats 36 hours in total including one non stop 24 hour run, then I think it should be able to handle the rest of the WEC season. Plus they have their other engines to fall back on.  Just my opinion ;)"

My friend's friend owns a few racecars and for something like $3k, he will provide the car, pit crew, tires, mechanical stuff, and anything else the car would need for the weekend, while he helps you out during the race via radio. All you do is show up to race. Only problem with this for me is I need an SCCA racing license to do that. I figured I'd just save up some money for Skip Barbers racing school since for a few hundred more dollars, you pretty much leave with a racing license. I figured the costs just to get started (not even race) is around $5k-6k. It's not cheap at all compared to doing some club kart racing where your costs are vastly less expensive. Just know what you are getting into when it comes to money."

Check out stock car racing in the UK, it's (comparitively) cheap, excellent fun and great competition. It's on an oval but you'll find that provides it's own challenges."

Black car should be penalized, probably heavily."

According to that video, yes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62i-_eoCMyM   If he decided, that to stay on the racing line, he had to move over, the red car has to make space, as the black car was clearly in front. I bet the black Ferrari expected the red one to brake, as he would never try to squeeze past."
motorsports,3bw360,Necrofridge,3,Thu Jul 2 18:05:43 2015 UTC,I think that's T5? Black car drives a blocking line in the middle of the track which is a dick move. The normal line in the corner veers to the right to take the left hand 90. There's almost a car width to the left and right of him and then he proceeds to move over to the left instead of giving the car behind him room. Either he didn't see him (which seems impossible given he seems to be checking his mirrors) or he was blocking too aggressively and caused a huge accident.
motorsports,3bw360,shunny14,2,Thu Jul 2 19:02:20 2015 UTC,Black car drives a blocking line in the middle of the track which is a dick move.    Since when is taking a defensive line a dick move?
motorsports,3bw360,musef1,3,Thu Jul 2 20:10:08 2015 UTC,When there's another car there.  Wouldn't have been a dick move if he had done it 1000 feet earlier like he should have.

motorsports,3bw360,theground2,2,Thu Jul 2 20:36:16 2015 UTC,"I think the most telling view is from the trailing car at the end. You can see it's partially the f430 driver being a pud, but also the 458 driver running out of room around the very slight bend.  They were both playing a stupid game where the 430 would beat the 458 through every corner and then get caught on the straights.   You have a good point about the late movement. Both guys are to blame IMO"
motorsports,3bw360,ShrewyLouie,3,Fri Jul 3 03:36:47 2015 UTC,"I don't mean when he moved across to block - the change in line which  caused the collision. I'm talking about the defensive middle-of-the-road line he was holding down the straight prior to the incident, the other user says such a thing is a dick move, I disagree, that's standard racing."
motorsports,3bw360,musef1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:33:11 2015 UTC,"Ah I see, I missed the first part of his comment.  Can be a dick move in that he should just pick his line and stick with it."
motorsports,3bw360,thenuge26,9,Thu Jul 2 20:39:24 2015 UTC,"This is a tough one. My initial reaction is that the black car punted the red car. But after looking at the video, it's not so simple.  This is a straight that's almost 4000 feet long, and there should be room for everyone. There is a slight bend prior to T5, so it's not an entirely straight straight. The driver of the black car does not appear to change his line (for better or worse) in response to the red car. From the camera perspective of the red car, it looks like the black car moves over to block. However, looking towards the horizon, it seems that the red car makes a directional change (to stay on track) to bring it into contact with the black car.   In non-contact racing series, the burden is usually on the driver of the overtaking (red) car to make a safe pass. The driver of the black car could have made racing room without much compromise to his line. If he had to do it all over again, the driver of the red car might choose to make his move to the right, and perhaps go for the over/under in T5. Try to avoid fucking up at triple digit speeds. Bad things happen fast."
motorsports,3bw360,plausiblycredulous,11,Thu Jul 2 18:52:40 2015 UTC,"I run this track in a racing sim a lot, and watch whenever there are sports car races on TV.

motorsports,3bw360,DickEB,3,Thu Jul 2 19:19:24 2015 UTC,"Agree, made a clear move across the track at 0:56. Also the hand movement to the left at 3:01 while looking in the mirror."
motorsports,3bw360,theground2,2,Thu Jul 2 20:34:17 2015 UTC,"The movement at 0:56 is after contact. He is going straight, though moving to the left of the track since it bends to the right. Same with 3:01. His wheel is slightly to the right of center the entire time until contact is made, at which point he steers slightly left."
motorsports,3bw360,Qel_Hoth,2,Thu Jul 2 21:28:13 2015 UTC,"I'm racing here this weekend and I concur, that is not the normal line. The driver of the black car blocked the red car and caused the incident."
motorsports,3bw360,skell15,-2,Fri Jul 3 02:53:51 2015 UTC,Sorry but are you blind?  The black car is supposed to be on the right side of the track since the next corner is to the left. (if we are talking about racing line).  The black car was in his way to the right side of the track. When he sees that the red car can has space enough to go to the inside and is faster than him he tries to close the gap. Really amateur error. Easy to see this I think.
motorsports,3bw360,colrevan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:32:26 2015 UTC,"Have you driven RA? I've only got a couple of days there, but I've seen comments from people with much more seat time there. There's a slight bend in the track before T5 that needs to be considered. My first impression was that the black car blocked the red car. Upon further viewing, and based on comments from people who know the track better than me, I don't think so. I do think the black car could have made room, but I don't think he made a move to block.  Do you see the driver of the black car do anything sudden with the wheel just prior to the contact? The (lateral) gap between the cars closes rather quickly (as seen from both the red car and the blue car). If the driver of the black car didn't provide the input to close the gap, who did?  One of the best ways to detect yaw visually is to look ahead to distant objects. From the red car's camera, it's clear that there was a change of direction just prior to contact. The red car turned to avoid dropping left side tires."
motorsports,3bw360,plausiblycredulous,3,Fri Jul 3 16:19:33 2015 UTC,"Black car f430 at fault, no two ways about it.  I find it ironic that in the video there's a thanks to Ferrari? Well, if he was driving almost any other roadcar-turned-specracer it probably wouldn't have taken off like it did. Either way thank the lord Juses Crust he didn't sustain any serious injuries. That's one of those crashes that you literally shit a brick whilst watching it."
motorsports,3bw360,MC_Dickie,3,Thu Jul 2 22:29:54 2015 UTC,Why do you say other racecars wouldn't take off like that? Just curious because of the GTR incident at the ring a couple months ago was similar.
motorsports,3bw360,sologuy3,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:05:17 2015 UTC,"Well racing cars have a flat floor, meaning when they get lifted, or end up travelling in an unintended direction they take off like a kite.  A road car obviously the floor isn't anywhere near as smoothed over. Except of course, for a 458. Most road cars turned into a spec racer don't have any underside floor mods so an inherent danger is less, obviously the danger in a 458 is its flat floor, there was a 458 crash a Le Sarthe a few years back too, tyre went and he spun out and ended up flying at 150mph+"

motorsports,3brr9o,MGJon,7,Wed Jul 1 18:03:12 2015 UTC,"It looks like you have everything planned very well already. However i'd like to point out a few things:  You don't know your way around a circuit and you are not comfortable driving a car at the limit. Autocross doesn't teach you that, it's a whole different sport. Neither does riding motorcycles. The racing lines are different vs a bike, the cornering inputs you receive are longer when compared to autocross. This means that you'll have to learn a completely different discipline, just like moving from rugby to american football! You still have a ball and hit people but that's pretty much it.     Before you sell your beloved wife's car (or wife's beloved car...) make sure you actually like this different discipline! Take your daily miatacrosser to a couple of trackdays to see what it's like and only then make a decision. Judging by your past experiences i'm sure you'll love it and buy the car right after the first session of the first trackday but still, many people read this subreddit and it's worth to give some general advice!    Entry level gear is a no-go. As others have stated you have to put safety first: a good multi-layer suit, good undergarments, a good helmet that's also lightweight (mostly because it helps in the event of a collision) etc. If the seat is old replace it as well as a precaution. composites become brittle with time.  Other than that just set a budget and double that... then you should be good to go. Motorsport sucks! :)"
motorsports,3brr9o,bse50,2,Wed Jul 1 21:06:15 2015 UTC,"Agree with all of this, though I will point out that some of the best rally drivers I know started out on motorcycles.  That might not help him on track, though.  They sorta discourage sideways through the corners."
motorsports,3brr9o,JohnnyDread,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:19:40 2015 UTC,"Great reply! Thanks!  You are 100% right. I don't know my way around a circuit as far as cars are concerned. What I meant was I know I have no fears about being on a track (and off the track, unfortunately) and have a good general feel for the track environment.   The only problem with the Miata as far as track duty is concerned is although it has a roll bar (helps stiffen it up as far as autocross is concerned), without hardmounting a seat to the floor pan I can't pass the broomstick test so 99% of clubs won't let me track it. I could try to rent the Del Sol or another race car for a day to get it on the track and make sure it is for me, though.   Safety is very much so first. I made the assumption that as long as the gear was SFI certified that it was safe. Is this not true? Is a multilayer suit that much better than a single layer with long johns? What is a decent helmet to look at that will protect the ol' watermelon but wont break the bank. As I said, by no means am I thinking of doing this 'cheap', but if I can avoid excess expenses it makes the whole thing a little more realistic."
motorsports,3brr9o,stug_life,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:29:15 2015 UTC,"A multilayer suit makes a world of difference. Also make sure that it's made of aramidic fibres, some suits are just covered in fire suppressants and after washing them a couple of times become worthless.  Helmet wise i'd go with Sparco, not too expensive and not too cheap. They are FIA compliant and you can also find replacement parts quite easily. Bell is another option."
motorsports,3brr9o,JohnnyDread,3,Thu Jul 2 06:47:02 2015 UTC,Plan to spend more on gear. A good multi-layer suit will be at least $400 (I think I got my Simpson for about $600 on clearance). A Hans will be $500+.

I have seatbelts that are designed to work with the HANS and have narrower shoulder belts like these. I recommend CarbonX undergarments and a multi-layer firesuit, mine is from Racequip. This is the helmet I use, easy to change the shield if you want something other than clear.   In my experience a V8 truck/SUV is minimum (for comfortably keeping up with traffic) for the tow vehicle, especially if you have extended periods of highway to/from the track. Looks like you've got a car with spare parts which is a plus and covers another big point of things break so be prepared to buy replacement/spare parts.   As far as the driving goes, I'm sure you'll be a quick learner already having autocross experience, however what /u/bse50 said about motorcycle /= autocross /= racetrack is 100% correct. The driving style is very different, for example there's a much bigger reward for being smooth than in autocross.   Hope this helps! Good luck and keep it shiny side up!"

In my experience a 2\2.2l turbo diesel SUV or station wagon is more than enough to keep up with traffic at reasonable speeds! Perhaps that's because i'm from the old continent and v6\v8 humungous beasts are very rare.
motorsports,3brr9o,Legend13CNS,2,Thu Jul 2 08:11:49 2015 UTC,"In the ""new world"".... small diesels are rare beasts, unfortunately.  We only really get diesels from the German manufacturers, and even then the only one that you can really tow with is the VW Tuareg which has a freakin V10 TDI.  None of the rest of the things they put diesels in really have a chassis that I'd be comfortable towing with.    On the flip side, V8 trucks/SUVs/vans are a dime a dozen over here.  We tow our AutoX car with a 97 Ford Econoline van without any issue at all.... and you can pick those up for under $2k in good condition.  Plenty of room in the back to sleep, too.  off topic, but I really do wish we got more small diesels over here :(  Mazda teased us with the Mazda6 diesel in 2011, and it still hasn't made an appearance!"
motorsports,3brr9o,bse50,2,Thu Jul 2 14:38:25 2015 UTC,"woah, 2k$ for a truck? that's dirt cheap!  I'm about to buy a freelander 2 to tow my lightweight car, it has a 2.2td engine and I consider it overkill... The diesel mazda 6 is amazing. It's almost as quiet as the petrol one and has a very smooth power delivery. It also handles like a mazda... it's amazing!"
motorsports,3brr9o,DSM1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:35:52 2015 UTC,"Yup.  I found 135 locally that are under $2k.  Some of them aren't running, but most are.  Just go to https://www.craigslist.org and pick a region, go to ""Cars & Trucks"", set the filter for $100-2000 and set the types as ""trucks/vans/suvs"" etc.  You'd be shocked at what's available."
motorsports,3brr9o,MGJon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:51:23 2015 UTC,"The key there is diesel. Like the others have already said small diesels don't really exist in the US. But, fun fact, the V10 TDI VW Touareg has the same towing capacity as my 6.0 Powerstroke Excursion (you don't need to get a big diesel truck). I'm also in Colorado where I need something that'll comfortably cruise with a trailer at 75 mph so that's part of why I say get a gas V8."
motorsports,3brr9o,canttaketheshyfromme,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:23:48 2015 UTC,"I'd still take a diesel i4 over any gas v8 for towing. Lower rpms, better mileage, beefier torque curve down low, where it matters etc. It sucks that you don't have many diesels there. I only recently changed my mind on them but modern diesel cars are the future towing wise."

First, my Miata is my daily so I would have to buy another car anways. Second, and more off putting to me, is in 'Spec' Miata if you want to run in the top 1/3 you need to put more money into an 'OEM' motor build than I will be purchasing a whole competitive race car for."
motorsports,3brr9o,bmwnut,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:38:56 2015 UTC,"All good reasons.  Another reason?  When you're just getting into it, buying a pre-built car is usually more cost-effective than building one.  Save the building of your own car until you're more experienced and have a better idea about what you want a race car to be.  You'll quickly figure out what you love and hate about that Del Sol."

And the extremely tight racing in SM means a lot of crunched fenders. I would be sorely uncomfortable racing in a unibody production car, one crunch and you'll have to break out the cutting torch and find a donor car before it'll even drive straight again. As an outsider looking in, it seems like a smartly purpose-built car like a FV or Legends car could cost less to keep running if you figure in the cost of contact repairs."

I'd rather support better, more talented drivers then some hack who just happened to help found DC shoes and has a lot of money to blow. I also cant stand the term ""hooning"", if you actually look it up its a description for people who drive like utter assholes on public roads and put other people at risk, mainly in austrailia. I'd be more of a fan if the guy could actually drive, i have the exact same problem with travis pastrana."
motorsports,3blf4h,coozyorcosie,3,Tue Jun 30 17:45:00 2015 UTC,I understand and agree; I also think drifting is a waste.   Ken can drive pretty well in Rally America and Global Rallycross competition.
motorsports,3blf4h,TipyUK,3,Tue Jun 30 18:17:38 2015 UTC,Both of which are child's play compared to the real FIA backed versions. Rally America is an absolute joke compared to WRC. Global Rally Cross is also a joke when compared to the FIA World Rally Cross championships. It annoys me that American marketing companies think they can try to fool real race fans into thinking their created-out-of-thin-air race series are even comparable to the real thing.
motorsports,3blf4h,deadstump,6,Tue Jun 30 18:39:53 2015 UTC,"I really think you are underestimating GRC and over estimating the FIA Rallycross.  In the GRC you have some very top notch drivers (whose names I am about to butcher) Isacsacsen, Froust, Block just to name a few.  I am not saying that the FIA guys are bad, but neither are the GRC guys.  What makes the FIA version better IMO is the courses.  The improvised tracks that the GRC runs on really ruins the racing a lot of the time.  I am not a Block fanboy by any stretch of the imagination, but I don't understand all the people who think he is a talentless hack.  He is never going to be a world champion or anything like that, but he has run competitively at several WRC events, does well with rallycross, and generally does fairly well in any event he enters.  I also don't understand all the hate for his Gymkhana videos.  They are not racing videos, they are car porn.  He is driving crazy cars around in places where you just can't do that making lots of smoke and doing some fairly intense stunts.  Think of it more of a skate video rather than a racing video where he is doing the trick again and again until it looks right on film, it is all about the presentation."
motorsports,3blf4h,r0nin,0,Tue Jun 30 18:52:53 2015 UTC,"Zero respect for GRC, just another event created by mega corporations with no real race backing. FIA Rallycross drivers would blow the doors off anyone in GRC, Foust and Block are the biggest jokes in the racing world aside from Danica Patrick. FTR Block has never been competitive in WRC, he crashed and totaled his ride more than he finished stages. I can appreciate the analogy of gymkhana being car porn and like skateboarding, but any ranked FIA WRC driver could do those gymkhana runs first try with a copilot.  I personally hate Ken Block because he is forced on car enthusiasts like he is the second coming of Jesus, especially back when he drove subaru's. Him driving those subarus and getting all those fuckboys to wear his lame DC branded gymkhana crap almost made me pass on my second brand new WRX. I just hate how whenever he drives at an event it's ""OH HERE COMES KEN BLOCK, EXPECT BIG BURN OUTS LIKE HE DOES IN HIS GYMKHANA VIDEOS. KEN BLOCK THIS KEN BLOCK THAT. The guy has done nothing but create some viral videos, and when he finally did try to get into real racing (and was let into WRC and other events based on gymkhana popularity alone) he sucked. Zero respect for someone who is constantly pumped up but cant walk the walk."
motorsports,3blf4h,redneckpunk,3,Tue Jun 30 21:41:40 2015 UTC,"Scott Speed and Nelson Piquet Jr, both former F1 drivers the latter being the current Formula E champ, drive in GRC. There are also plenty of non-americans running in GRC who have been successful rally drivers on other continents.  It's not really the bottom of the barrel like you make it out to be, and Ken Block holds his own."

His style is just--I always use this comparison--very Ricky Bobby. It lights the fans up, and sometimes wins races, but hard to win a title that way.  Also, Rhys Millen--newly crowned Pikes Peak winner--is a car-owner, and won two races last year driving, but after Hyundai pulled out of American motorsport entirely to focus on their WRC effort he's had to dial back his rallycross efforts."

motorsports,3b6vcz,alephnul,6,Fri Jun 26 17:43:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even limiting the size of the bikes can't really eliminate the prospect of a fatality. You have to admit that Fabrizio Meoni's KTM950 Adventure was madness incarnate, but damn it was exciting to watch.   They trimmed the displacement down to 650 and people still died, then down to 450, and they still die. There is probably a limit that would eliminate fatalities, but it would also spawn a new race without the limit. People will do things that risk their lives."
motorsports,3b6vcz,flipjj,3,Fri Jun 26 17:53:24 2015 UTC,"The other side of this is that if you reduce the displacement too much, the allure of the race goes away, because if it's too easy, no one will be interested.  That's the interesting conundrum of all motorsports, really. If it's not dangerous enough, no one bothers with it, because there's a feeling of ""I could do that"". If it's too dangerous to the point that people die all the time, who wants to be around for it?  I remember the moment I realised this truth and accepted it. I had just had a karting accident and couldn't move my neck for about a week, so I spent it lying in bed reading a new book my dad had bought me: an old title called The Greatest Race Drivers of All Time.

He either has some massive balls or some massive Brembos. What a joy to watch those fantastically planted Lotus.  Throw 450 bhp in them and they still run on rails.  By far my favorite track day legend."
motorsports,3b3wvq,F1GP,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:58:35 2015 UTC,"Although he obviously is a fast driver. The difference in speed mostly comes from bad positioning and poorly chosen braking spots by his competitors.  The only other car that actually sets up any kind of defense is the yellow #10.   And then there is this god awefull flashing of the lights as he tries to overtake any of his competitors. Granted im not familiar with this particular cup, butn this seemed like a race session and they were all racing for position. Flashing your lights should only be used as a warning to backmarkers.  But that is just my humble opinion."

There's no fuel, but there's the risk of tens of thousands of amps discharging in an unwanted way. You only need to see the safety involved around hybrid and EV vehicle servicing, and the training the techs need to go through to see how risky it is (everyone has to work on rubber mats, wearing thick rubber gloves when handling the cells, etc).  I'm pretty sure once the tech's fully understood, and the safety risks fully evaluated after a couple of seasons then battery swaps may be introduced. Racing fuel is waaayyy more volatile (except for diesel), and refuelling is commonplace but with really strict safety procedures, so battery changes are sure to be on the way at some point."

Normally I'm not a fan of  adding them into tracks, but agree it's something that should happen as part of modernizing the track.  As he says also, it's much more easy to actually accomplish than getting unique BoP requirements agreed to by everyone."
motorsports,3addue,Bane,5,Fri Jun 19 17:52:30 2015 UTC,They could probably just add the chicanes for GT racing and leave the straights for public days. I think that would be a good compromise. Can you imagine if Circuit de la Sarthe still had that ridiculous straight?
motorsports,3addue,hawaii_dude,5,Fri Jun 19 19:11:58 2015 UTC,"Good idea, there is likely more than enough space for that too at all the locations mentioned. The escape portions for chicanes are straight through bit's anyway with the foam barriers to go around so should be pretty straight forward to do I think."
motorsports,3addue,Bane,3,Fri Jun 19 19:23:43 2015 UTC,"To preface things a bit, I am a rally guy.  Nurburg is an amazing road.  Its blindingly fast straights with blind crests and strange cambered turns are amazing, but as a racetrack it is lacking.  It is rather narrow, there is no run off, etc.  But all that being said, it would be a sad day when the ring is no longer running.  It is iconic, like Daytona, or Spa, or Monza, or Monico.  Without the ring motorsports will be missing something.  Maybe updating it is the right way to go, I don't know."

It's too damn long, the straights are too fast that lead into corners that are too tight to maintain speed through, it's just not fun to drive.  I much prefer tracks like Laguna Seca, Streets of Willow Springs, or Tsukuba."
motorsports,3addue,QuickStopRandal,6,Fri Jun 19 15:38:33 2015 UTC,You probably haven't raced it enough to memorize the corners. No track is fun until you memorize it and can drive it properly.

motorsports,3addue,QuickStopRandal,5,Fri Jun 19 19:48:00 2015 UTC,"I guess I just don't understand forming an opinion without really getting to know a track first.

motorsports,3addue,QuickStopRandal,9,Fri Jun 19 17:35:21 2015 UTC,"But the Nurburgring is a tight, flowing, technical track.  You may not realize it but there's incredible amounts of time to gain in the sector following the Karussell, not to mention in the undulating section leading up to Bergwerk.  It's the ultimate example of a racetrack that exposes a driver's skill, in particular their lines and speed into corners.  Getting the most out of those sectors in particular or in the long climb up the hill after Bergwerk is a special feeling, even in video games, the sort that I only ever feel on tracks like Spa or Mount Panorama."
motorsports,3addue,DdW-M,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:17:36 2015 UTC,"I also don't like Spa or Mount Panorama.  When I said tight, I don't mean narrow corridors (which is what I hate the most, honestly), I mean short straights and lots of corners.  Autumn Ring and Autumn Ring Mini are some of my most driven courses on Gran Turismo, that's what racing should be IMO, everything else is just highway driving really fast and taking short breaks to race before getting back on the highway."
motorsports,3addue,QuickStopRandal,3,Fri Jun 19 21:30:01 2015 UTC,"Fair respect to your opinion, but it sounds like you just like karting.  There's a reason why tracks like Spa, the Nurburgring, Suzuka, old Imola, the Osterreichring always come up when racing drivers talk about their favorite tracks.  It's the ability to take high speeds into the corners while keeping the balance of the car correct without compromising your line into the next corner which really makes racing special.  Going through little rinky-dink corners is just too easy, taking Eau-Rouge or Blanchimont or Tamburello at the top end is what I want to see and experience."
motorsports,3addue,DdW-M,-5,Fri Jun 19 21:46:40 2015 UTC,"Going through little rinky-dink corners is just too easy   Oh I beg to fucking differ.  Come to a karting track and get in a 2-stroke and after your ribs are broken from the G forces and you've spun out and slammed into a wall because your driving skills can't hack it, tell me again the corners are ""rinky dink and easy"".  Car racing is pussy shit compared to karting on a physical level and often times a lap time level as well.    Go get back on the highway, grandpa, it's gentler on your fragile old bones."
motorsports,3addue,QuickStopRandal,6,Fri Jun 19 21:55:40 2015 UTC,"Lol, I'm just trying to have a reasonable conversation with you man.  I do kart as much as I can, it's awesome fun and it's difficult, I'm not shitting on that.  But obviously you have no such respect for any other discipline.  Sports cars or higher level single-seaters use bigger tracks for obvious reasons.  When I was referring to rinky-dink corners I meant slow speed corners in high speed cars, like the end lap chicane at Spa, there's just no satisfaction.  But obviously you can't be reasoned with."
motorsports,3addue,DdW-M,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:02:06 2015 UTC,"I hate chicanes, too, and you just listed one of the tracks that you said you like that features them.  Autumn Ring, for example, never has you come to a dead stop like that.  I guess ""momentum"" tracks are the best term for what I like, tracks where you can't just win by upping the horsepower and outrunning everyone, you have to earn every inch by balancing steering, brakes, and throttle constantly every lap.  That's skilled racing, there's no skill in holding down the gas pedal on a back straight."
motorsports,3addue,QuickStopRandal,6,Fri Jun 19 22:23:25 2015 UTC,"Autumn Ring is a good track, and just because a track has 1 or 2 corners that I don't like doesn't mean it isn't a great track, Spa in particular makes up for it with the previously mentioned corners and my personal favorite, Pouhon.  My point is just that the tracks that I've mentioned are great not because of the long straights, but because of the speed management required.  Making sure you get the clean exit to reach maximum speed on a straight and then nailing the ensuing breaking point while not scrubbing off too much speed is what makes them special, there's just so much time to be gained there.  Your point about upping the horsepower is relevant in video games, but only if you're racing a car that vastly outclasses your opponent.  In a level field, which there is in pretty much any racing class out there, the lengths of the straights don't matter, it's the same for everyone.  But when you reach the end and you have to bring yourself back to the maximum possible speed that the corner dictates, it brings so much more excitement."
motorsports,3addue,DdW-M,2,Fri Jun 19 22:42:41 2015 UTC,"You do realize youre comparing the most legendary racetracks in the world, which youve only driven in a lightweight sim (Gran Turismo, maybe even with a controller? lol), to karting tracks? Sure, youre allowed to have a preference. But if you think karting and karting tracks are superior to the most storied and difficult tracks across the globe, youre not just biased, youre delusional.  Nurburgring is an unprecedented test of driving skill, pretty much regardless of what youre driving. The camber changes, the undulation, the sweeping bends and the tight corners... Theyre all part of one ridiculous lap and it takes a lot of time to learn them all. But when you do, even in a game or sim, its amazing.  Now, it might not be the best track in the world for racing, most long tracks usually arent. But if is the most challenging, the most demanding one; except for Isle of Man TT (but thats not technically a racetrack). It is great for hotlapping though, and is always my go-to for testing new cars or setups in the various sims I havs in which its available."

So while it's not cheap depending on where you are in the world, you could probably come up with the money to get there if you really wanted to."
motorsports,3addue,techieman33,-6,Fri Jun 19 18:02:34 2015 UTC,"Because I'll get the full experience in a shitbox 3 cylinder diesel, right?  Besides, I didn't mean millions to race at one specific track, I meant as an over-arcing statement that it's impractical to expect anyone but a well funded professional race driver to be able to drive enough tracks to be able to say anything about them from first hand in-real-life experience over driving them in a simulator.  Also, for the record, for the price of a trip to Germany I could buy a 2-stroke race kart and have a lot more fun than a crowded lap around a shitty track in an even shittier car."
motorsports,3addue,QuickStopRandal,6,Fri Jun 19 19:15:56 2015 UTC,My buddy just got back from there.  He rented a 911 and did 5 laps.  It cost 900 euros total for the car and track fee and he said it was the best day of his life.

High speed, differing cambers and entrance angles, falls and rises, double and triple apexes, it's an incredibly difficult track.   It's probably not fun for you because you haven't mastered it yet. I've done probably 300-400 laps of it on various simulators over the years and I adore the track and once you've done it enough whilst actually trying to learn it, it's quite simple to be fast and enjoy yourself."

I treat it more as a fun, hard track, rather than a hot lap track. Having raced on it in game though, I can't believe they run real races on it. It's too long, there's no run off in a lot of areas, and the straights are way too long."

I really hate how the most highly regarded tracks are actually pretty shitty (very bad pavement at both Le Mans and Nurburgring) and suuuuuper dangerous.

It may be 75 at the start line and 35 at the top. Wind can be nasty too.  The reason Devils Playground is so crowded is because it is the party place. There is not really another spot like it other than down at the bottom with the competitors. Plenty of places to watch the race but, you won't have the crowd or tailgate atmosphere."
motorsports,3a7zcg,leaknoil,2,Thu Jun 18 01:36:20 2015 UTC,"I went back in 10 or 11, when Moster Tajima finally broke the 10 Minute Barrier in his GoPro sponsored car. Last year of the unpaved roads.  Me and a couple of friends camped out the day before.  The night before we setup camp right below Glen Cove.  The day of the race we woke up right around 3:30 to pack up and start our trek up to Devils Playground to watch the race.  It wasn't that cold where we camped, but by the time we got up to Devils Playground at 12K+ feet up, it was around 20 degrees with 40+mph winds at around 4 in the morning.  You have to get up that early since they close the roads at 6:30 or 7AM to setup for the race.  Needless to say I stayed in my friends truck until the sun came up since I was not prepared for that kind of cold and altitude (just flew in from Houston several days before.)  I could barely walk 40-50 yards before getting short of breath.  The race is truly a all day event.  Once they close down the roads, you will not have a chance to go down until the race is over and the all the racers go back down the mountain.  We didn't get off the mountain until 10 or 11 that night since the traffic jam going down is a major clusterfuck.  Having said all that, it was probably one of the best times I have ever had.  I would definitely recommend going to Devils Playground to watch the race.  It has the best vantage point of watching most of the course and it's the highest spectator point you can drive to.  Yes, it's crowded, but at least they have plenty of portable toilets.  It's a great motorsports event to go to at least once in your life.  My next big race would be  the 24 Hours of Lemans!"

Pretty quiet and had views of the cars driving on the cliffs overhead as well. It looks like they are expanding that viewing area this year, so I think we'll watch from the hairpin to the west. Make sure to bring cold weather clothing, as others are saying, but also lots of sunscreen. Literally the right half of my face was fried from the sunrise before I thought to put sunscreen on. Make sure you get there VERY early. They limit the number of cars on the mountain, not people. We arrived at about 9 pm Saturday and got in line. They opened the gates at 3 am and getting there the night before definitely helped. Looks like it's going to be an exciting race this year. :)"

motorsports,39pwgp,hamtoucher,2,Sun Jun 14 11:00:44 2015 UTC,"Light and heavy classes is the easy way to do it, and I'm totally fine with that, but in spite of Houston having some of the best (large, new, well-maintained) rental kart facilities anywhere, the management simply does not understand how much weight affects results.  I guess they're afraid that they'll be ""fat shaming"" if they make people step on a scale, but I say just throw everyone into the ""light"" class if they don't want to weigh themselves.  I want to race people on equal terms, not see who the better horse jockey would be.  In spite of all of this, I still came 2nd in the 2015 Season 1 K1 Speed GP for Houston.  Wanna take a guess who won it?  A dude that might be 150 lbs soaking wet holding a brick.  Don't get me wrong, he's a good driver, too, but come on."

I was in the grandstand and everyone had their ears blocked ready to go (those cars are freaking loud and rattle even your very soul) and the lights flashed and commentator said something to the tune of ""they've aborted the start"" so everyone took their hands away from their ears and the cars stopped revving.

No, I would have to achieve that same speed with the new setup in order to claim that title.  Note: That is just a illustrative analogy.

motorsports,38lfc8,alephnul,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:07:43 2015 UTC,"Simply put - The D-Type exemplifies the passion and the innovation that Jaguar had brought to Le Mans during 55-57, when they were racing against automotive manufacturing giants like Mercedes Benz; the car is an inspiration to the work that we are doing to demonstrate our technology and that is why we have chosen this specific car.   As for the high speed lift, we have a GT Roadster chassis that is being expertly tuned by our Race Team manager and 3 time land speed record holder, Carl Dilley.

They didn't race again for almost 30 years.  Good luck to you though. I would love to see you get the record."
motorsports,38lfc8,alephnul,2,Sat Jun 6 01:14:42 2015 UTC,"Having done much research into Jaguar and their early years of innovation, we too discovered the unfortunate accidents during the Le Mans races and the withdrawal of Mercedes. Your statement is true that Mercedes withdrew from the 1955 race and did not return for some time.   We however both acknowledge and are inspired by the ambition, persistence, and innovation that Jaguar would have needed to have during those early years. What inspires us, and what led us to choosing the D-Type was the knowledge that - at that time, Jaguar was merely a small team of engineers fueled with a passion to make a lasting impact on the automotive industry, against many other well established manufacturers. And at Le Mans, they were successful - three years in a row.   We are excited about having the opportunity to showcase the technology that we are passionate about; with an iconic car that historically, has fueled individuals to dream, innovate and push advancements in the automotive industry."

motorsports,38emz7,Omophorus,9,Wed Jun 3 19:28:24 2015 UTC,"And I'll give my standard response to these sorts of comments.  The FIA sets out very strict rules for grade 1 tracks, and when a new country wants to flaunt its economic status by hosting a GP, they need to have a track that complies with the FIA rules.  They all turn to Hermann Tilke, because he is the only one who has the expertise and the track record to deliver.  It's not that he designs boring tracks (Istanbul, anyone?), it's that between the land he's given to work with, the VERY stringent requirements of the FIA, and the demands of his customers (usually involving ludicrously long straights in some kind of dick-measuring contest), there simply isn't that much room to do anything creative or interesting.  When some of those concerns are alleviated (e.g. land in Istanbul, requirement for a ridiculous straight in places like COTA, etc.) the tracks get more interesting.  The FIA sets the demands for grade 1 tracks, and sets the requirement that F1 only be hosted at grade 1 tracks.  The problem is not, in and of itself, with F1, but with the FIA's efforts to make racing safer.  Given the costs and complexities involved in modern top-tier racing, I don't think it's reasonable to expect an about-face from the FIA on safety.  If IndyCar continues to gain popularity, it's ultimately in for the same fate."

motorsports,3759hc,Geofferytheastronaut,14,Mon May 25 00:15:00 2015 UTC,"You can pretty much figure out what the fastest AutoX cars are by the classes PAX score. Think of it as a multiplier on your time (not sure if it's actually scored that simply but that's the gist). So if you run a 60 second time with a PAX of 0.5 then you'll have a 30 second run. But if you ran a 35 second run with a pax of 0.95 or something you lose.  The highest PAX scores in the 2015 rules are:   A-Modified at 1.000 FSAE at 0.984 B-Modified at 0.964   The highest PAX stock cars are the X-Prepared cars at 0.905.  Another note, I think the DSR cars fit in one of the Modified classes. I forget the crossover on the rules. But DSR (D-Sports Racer, there are also A, B, C, etc Sports Racer classes) are somewhere between an FSAE car (600cc engine) and Formula Ford/F2000 (2 Liter engine), so usually a liter bike engine. DSR's hold the top track records at small racetracks all over the country, they're goddamn rocketships. And some of the newer ones like the Stohrs are gorgeous. They're kind of the next generation of the old H-modified cars, which were of a similar size and usually designed to look like scaled down versions of famous LMP cars from the '60s and '70s."

motorsports,3759hc,kowalski71,4,Mon May 25 01:27:11 2015 UTC,"Well check out your local club track (local might mean hours away) cause a lot of them will have an open wheel class as well. So you can build for autocross but if you ever get a wheel to wheel itch you can do a relatively casual weekend of it without worrying about super aggressive driving. Usually they're a weird mix of Formula Vee, Formula 500, A/B-Mod, and DSR. With that wide spread of performance it's not really about winning anyway. Also, I conveniently arranged those classes in the approximate order of cost to run. You should google Formula Vee and Formula 500 (possibly soon to be 600 to accomodate FSAE cars) as well, they would both be cheaper but slower than the A/B-mod and DSR."

There's tons of info on the SCCA website and of course hanging around at your local AutoX would be really educational. If you go and just volunteer you'll win hearts and minds, they're always struggling for course workers. And someone may offer you a ridealong if you're polite about it.  Lastly, there's pretty much no car that can't AutoX. High center of gravity vehicles like trucks and SUVs are pretty much all they would turn away. I've seen automatic base model Subaru Imprezas, beater Camrys, all sorts of things out there. The whole point is to encourage the 'run what you brung' mentality and get people into motorsport. So if you have access to a car that is even slightly sporting when you squint out of one eye sideways at it then it's probably good for a first AutoX."
motorsports,3759hc,kowalski71,2,Mon May 25 01:41:03 2015 UTC,I agree with the run what you brung mentality. A friend autox's his Prius and has a blast.

motorsports,3759hc,Shinny1337,1 point,Mon May 25 13:05:04 2015 UTC,The higher speed karting classes are pretty expensive and they don't really scale up to a full size racetrack. An older DSR or A-Mod can hold its own on a track as well as an autocross.
motorsports,3759hc,corndesigns,2,Mon May 25 21:00:24 2015 UTC,The mod classes are generally for that sort of thing. We have some guys who run custom tube chassis race cars and old formula cars in our local group.

There is never ""permission"" to pass.  The overtaking car is the responsible car for executing a safe pass, up until about the time both cars are sharing the same piece of real estate.  State side this is generally once my front bumper has purchase on your rear.  Assume if you can SEE a yellow flag you MAY NOT PASS A CAR.  It doesn't matter if they're doing 30 mph, you are not allowed to pass.  If an unsafe condition comes up because of this then you take the pass and then likely get reemed out because corner workers can be a bit robotic.  Passing for position is an ultimate no no and it will burn you hard.  in some sanctioning bodies you are controlled by the yellow condition until the next ""green"" (no flag condition) manned corner station.  In some sanctioning bodies are clear once you pass the incident.  The concern over the latter rule is that there may be multiple incidents between corner stations or there may be a full course yellow.  Priority:  Red (shown at bridge) or black + yellow (manned corner) - Full Stop, the session has ceased and is under emergency control  Black (bridge) - you are being a dick, come in and get yelled at.  yellow, waving - There is a dangerous situation on track, a car may be out of control.  You the driver may not lose control of your vehicle.  In one situation a friend overdrove under yellow and backed it into a sand trap.  His car got run over by a rescue vehicle and he was severely penalized for being in the wrong place.  Had he been in control of his vehicle it would have been a non incident.  yellow, standing - there is a vehicle or safety person off track, no passing allowed, a driver may not lose control of their vehicle.  furled black (bridge only) - you are being a dick.  knock it off. This flag will generally be wagged at you as if an extension of the stewards naughty pointer finger.  white - slow moving vehicle on track.  Assume safety or mechanical issues.  Maintain control of your vehicle.  black w/ orange - your car is a flailing piece of shit, come in and get yelled at.  edit:  yellow/red - debris flag.  There is unwanted material on the track.  This could be oil, coolant, branches, car parts, dirt, gravel, etc.  The corner worker will generally indicate which side of the track you should use by ""pulling"" or ""pushing"" with hand signals.  The flag is informational only, no change in action is required by the driver.  blue/yellow - faster traffic approaching, check your mirrors.  green/none - session underway  checker - session ceased amicably"

So in an extreme situation, if the car you want to pass has STOPPED because he's obeyed the blue flag, then tough luck, park behind it until he decides to lift his handbrake and you're past the yellow flag zone.  (By the way, I love the 'you're being a dick' comments. Wish they could show that flag more to Sergio Canamasas or Pastor Maldonado)."
motorsports,36wp02,thefirebuilds,3,Fri May 22 20:26:00 2015 UTC,"if the car you want to pass has STOPPED because he's obeyed the blue flag,   Yeah, that guy wouldn't be invited back.  That's not what it means to obey the blue flag.  This driver is incompetent.  I race a slow car but it's the 2nd fasted car in the GROUP I run in (small production).  Lapped traffic in other classes is a huge part of strategy, and there's been plenty of times I got stuck behind some noodle in an air cooled VW doing 30% the traffic speed.  He's going as fast as he can though.  I got screwed one race by a british car dropping a driveshaft and becoming a yellow flag for the rest of the session.  Really messed me up.  There are some weird catch-up rules in ALMS/TUDOR now that I don't really understand where they invite lap-down competitors to catch up under FCY.  It's not the safest thing to me but they're supposed to be pros so.  F1 is different, all those cars should be top flight, no mixed pace racing.  Mixed pace racing is far more exciting for the drivers and the spectators."

""There's a race going on and you're not in it.. pay attention.""  I worked SCCA races a few years ago, and had a driver come over livid at me that I ""kept showing him the blue flag.""  ""I was at the lead of a pack of cars and was faster than all of them.  We were all racing for position.  I don't know why the fuck you kept showing me the blue flag!""  ""Well I wasn't showing it to you... I was showing it to the Spec Racer Ford with the big novice X on the bumper that was 3 cars back and slow through that corner every other lap.  Do you remember him?""  ""No""  ""Oh... then maybe you should heed the blue flag and check your mirrors too.""  ""Look man, I'm out racing for position... showing a blue flag every other lap is distracting!""  One of the racers sitting across the table from me chimed in at this point.

I'm very color sensitive and some of my friends are really color blind.  I understand what you're saying and I understand what the driver is saying.

motorsports,36wp02,Spoonwacker,1 point,Fri May 22 20:50:35 2015 UTC,"Well, they weren't all on the same lap.  There was a SRF in the middle of a bunch of Spec Miatas... he was a novice... he was a lap down... and he was just fast enough to keep pace with them through most of the course.  As luck had it, he hits us on a straight right after  a corner he kept screwing up, and usually they were 3 wide with him to the right and another Miata behind him trying to figure out how to get by.    But, alas, I quit flagging races.  Got chewed out and seen other workers chewed out too many times by people who seem to forget everyone out there is volunteering their time.  Even had stewards and the flag chief jump down my throat on one occasion... the last occasion.  It's fun, and I know races can't happen without volunteers.... but it's just not worth it to me anymore."
motorsports,36wp02,Iamcaptainslow,1 point,Fri May 22 20:56:45 2015 UTC,SCCA likes to pair SRF with SM but it's really not a great thing.  As an SM driver the SRF are impossible to see.  They may have similar lap times but their composure on the track is quite a lot different.  SM has to keep a ridiculous speed in the corners (esp on the old toyo street tires) and the SRF are like - eh 30% lighter?  I shy away from races that pair these two groups.  I like SRF in with the little open wheel stuff.  And I understand what you're saying.  Lots of entitlement.  In the old days worker whites got you free beer all night.  Now it's like you're an employee.
motorsports,36wp02,thefirebuilds,1 point,Fri May 22 21:00:47 2015 UTC,I think this hypothetical situation is unlikely. Under a yellow flag situation there shouldn't also be a corner worker throwing a passing flag. And if there's a yellow flag and a stopped car I would assume it's having a mechanical and I would pass it. Race stewards are unlikely to ding you for passing a broke down car. And I'm not stopping on a race track without red flag condition or my engine ceases to go boom boom.

They banned refueling again in 2010, even without turbocharged engines, I think in the name of safety, and to promote passing on the track.   I honestly thought they'd just keep reducing the max fuel available from then on and we'd never see refuelling again. We've added KERS, we've got turbos....why on earth do we need to refuel? The fuel cells are clearly safer than refueling, and the weight difference from start of race to end is an interesting engineering and driver challenge.

motorsports,36029y,hotsizzlepancakes,5,Fri May 15 15:41:38 2015 UTC,"Married father-of-one Simon McKinley, 34, from Naul on the Meath/Dublin border, was seriously injured on Saturday when he lost control of his single-seater racing car. Despite the best efforts of event emergency crews, Mr McKinley died at the scene.  The crash happened just seconds after the start of Mr McKinley’s hill climb and only 300 metres from the start line. It appears his car collided with a bale of hay before ploughing into the face of a 25ft high stone cliff. There was some evidence of fire at the scene but it wasn’t significant.  Debris from the car, including its red fibreglass hull, was visible at the scene after the car had been removed for a technical examination. Red paint could also be clearly seen on the rock face where several large chunks of stone had been dislodged in the collision.  Mr McKinley was a four-time reigning Irish Hillclimb and Sprint Champion, while his wife Deirdre, 34, has won the fastest lady award several times in recent years.  The crash happened during the Clare Motor Club Annual Hillclimb which was held on Scalp Hill between Carran and Balharbour in the Burren.  Hillclimbs take place on closed roads where competitors compete to achieve the fastest time driving up a hill. The hill is usually about one mile long with competitors getting a practice run and three timed runs.  The accident happened at around 5.30pm during the drivers’ final runs of the day. It’s understood the victim’s wife was also taking part in the event. The couple have a young son.  One driver said: “This was the man to beat. He was a brilliant driver. Someone said recently he ‘was the best racing driver you never heard off’. He was a great talent. We’re just numb.”"

motorsports,35ncn1,brownyR31,5,Tue May 12 08:58:21 2015 UTC,how much does it cost to run something like this?
motorsports,35ncn1,Situis,4,Tue May 12 00:35:15 2015 UTC,"A small team runs the car for me with all expenses for €1000 a weekend. Then entry fees are around €200 and testing fee to the track is €100/200 depending on half day or full day.  In this championship there are 3 classes. C for novices in their first year of vees (less than 6 races), B for guys who raced in C the previous year and A for guys who have won the B or C championship or have been racing them for a long time. Most weekends there is a B&C race before the A race, so you get two races for the price of one. It's good to help newcomers get up to speed and it has surely helped me as I'm almost on A race pace now and it's my first year. I'm also the only novice who's showed up for more than one race so I pretty much have that championship won now. I come from a sim racing background (quite successful) and racing these cars is like heaven to me. It's basic but it's the cheapest you can get and its the best buzz I've had in a long time. Highly recommend!"

What about some snips from interviews with drivers? or shots of someone working on a car that has a technical problem? A shot of a stationery wheel bristling with metal spikes, launches and sprays the camera with snow and ice? Nope? Those helicopter shots must have blown the budget.  I was so glad when the Porsche showed up at the end 'cause there were trees in the foreground of the shot, I was like ""TREES!"""

Warren Luff was Craig Lowndes' co driver in previous years but was with HRT in 2015, so they had a good friendship. In practice Luff lost the brakes in his car as he followed Lowndes towards turn 2. He hit the back of him and both suffered considerable damage.  http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2014/10/11/1227087/289434-4e9801ac-50e9-11e4-852c-a6aaa2413bba.jpg  Here's the video.  https://youtu.be/dmEThjsnrh8"

motorsports,34s54p,cmd_iii,6,Mon May 4 08:41:39 2015 UTC,The answer is yes. And the answer to the real question is who would win the fist fight after the finale. That answer is Earnhardt.

Earnhardt on the other hand didn't need a gap, he just ""moved"" people. I'm certain he was the case study for developing the PIT maneuver."
motorsports,34s54p,DriversValhalla,5,Tue May 5 21:06:13 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting idea, but for me, if I want to see pure driving talent, change the lineup to include cars with performance and no technological aids.

motorsports,34s54p,heeltoe,2,Mon May 4 12:48:36 2015 UTC,"Power steering.  That's about it.  No traction control, no ABS, no active suspension, etc.  There are a ton of buttons on the steering wheel, but those are to tighten/loosen the differential lock-up, adjust the brake bias, adjust the engine mapping, adjust the amount of harvesting done by and power provided by the hybrid system, etc.  The drivers are pushing some combination of buttons and switches on nearly every corner of every lap (in addition to shifting).  If ""a ludicrous number of settings to memorize and micromanage, to get faster lap times"" are driver aids, I guess F1 is guilty.  But those settings make the car harder to drive, not easier."

motorsports,34s54p,bse50,3,Mon May 4 03:32:38 2015 UTC,"I see Senna winning every challenge with ten days to get accustomed to a car.  He was extremely pragmatic and tackled his races in a way that would be considered obsessive by today's standards. He studied the track millimeter by millimeter, knew the car inside out and that was coupled to one of the most polished driving techniques of any driver.  There's a reason why he is considered the best driver ever despite not being the most successful."
motorsports,34s54p,stug_life,2,Mon May 4 08:07:47 2015 UTC,"Senna, he'd be more in his element in every race except Charlotte.  Dale spent most of his career on ovals and Senna on road courses"

motorsports,34s54p,Miniack,3,Mon May 4 04:44:14 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea, primarily because both of these drivers get their style and speed from being loose. Nascar more of a necessity, but senna was always dancing the rear end around.      R1 : Senna. Open wheeler category and sense of speed would give senna the edge. His sense of judgement and how to properly use a car with so much power to weight.       R2: Earnhardt. Stick shift, driving style. enough said.      R3: Senna. I was thinking about this for a while and I can't get past the fact that senna was first and foremost a karter, so he'd like the small car. BUT Earnhardt would be better at maintaining speed, and with a long flowing track and little power I think that'd be most important.     R4: Senna raced it for years.  R5: Small tight track, huge importance on keeping grip high and being able to effectively put the power down. Senna again."
motorsports,34s54p,Gregoryv022,8,Mon May 4 04:12:58 2015 UTC,Um..... Are you saying senna can't stick shift?   You realize he only used h-pattern gearboxes in F1 right?
motorsports,34s54p,Miniack,1 point,Mon May 4 07:17:11 2015 UTC,"I wrote a whole response and nitpicking something has given you a different conclusion. R5 for instance includes sennas ability to put the power down, i.e. using both throttle input and transmission.    I was under the impression that the rules regarding nascar transmission have been relatively unchanged for decades, it still is a 4 speed unit yea? I'd have thought earnhardt would be more attune to driving with that type.      Senna raced with Hewland gearboxes. They weren't H pattern in the sense that a normal car is, they pivot around a different point just near your forearm and my decision was based on the fact that the two feel nothing alike."
motorsports,34s54p,zagadka-1,-1,Tue May 5 06:26:55 2015 UTC,"You realize he only used h-pattern gearboxes in F1 right?   For most of his seasons in F1 he did, not all. The MP4/7 (1992), MP4/8 (1993) and FW16 (1994) were all semi auto."
