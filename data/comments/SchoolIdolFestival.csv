SchoolIdolFestival,3dz7iv,Crystalwolf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:00:40 2015 UTC,"I'm back with the image information... This is what I've been told and found myself.  If I simply collect from random net galleries, there could be no way to know for certain myself who the author of each individual piece is, since there are multiple people working on them.  Unfortunately, unless I want to erase everything from the gallery and start over, I couldn't really properly cite.  The biggest and most famous author seems to be あさはか, going by @asahaka_315 on Twitter. His blog is at http://asahaka-scfes.blogspot.jp/  Since it appears that his older site was shut down (see his notice on his blog), his older work might have been archived in threads such as this one on a Taiwanese gaming site:  http://forum.gamer.com.tw/C.php?bsn=44842&snA=1051  HOWEVER, that itself couldn't be certain since there are multiple authors responsible for stuff posted on that site itself, starting with the author of that thread, chun99112. In that thread, he compared a pic of his with one that's done by someone else, and I myself couldn't really tell the difference. I suppose you could only easily tell if you work on those things yourself.  Other authors whose work appear on that gaming site includes kylewoo51200 and YING_RinHaru. See this thread: http://m.gamer.com.tw/forum/Co.php?bsn=44842&snB=15888  Sigh... I really don't want to start over (doing the gallery involved a lot of clicking and typing... click click click click click copying names back and forth between two browsers I shudder to do it again) but, if I really want to cite there's no other way. What do you think?"

SchoolIdolFestival,3e182t,theguynamedkb_z,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:55:58 2015 UTC,"Nope. You can't retrieve it unless you email KLab and that process can take months. I'm assuming you don't have the transfer code.   You can't email and ask for a retrieval with that little information - especially with no ID, it's a key piece of information. In my case, I provided everything they asked and more and they still took three months.   Sorry to say this, but it looks pretty bad right now - you may not get it back. I think you should just play on the account you have now - unless you have more information about your account, then it's not really worth emailing them."

If someone has you as a friend, they may be able to help you with your profile ID.   There is no way to retrieve it without emailing KLab unless you have a transfer code, which given you're posting here, I imagine you don't."
SchoolIdolFestival,3e182t,Music-Piano,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:05:38 2015 UTC,"I can remember my main card and in-game name but I just added random people, I don't have a friend on it that I know personally."
SchoolIdolFestival,3e182t,Yumacaroni,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:10:10 2015 UTC,"Do you remember what rank you achieved in the most recent event (approximately) and what your display name is? This is time-sensitive as event results will only be available to view for a couple more hours. Someone can try to find your profile (and therefore friend ID) that way.  You will still have to go through the whole process of e-mailing kLab support and so on. It's recommended to always, always have a current transfer code for your account written down or stored on a separate device - they take a year to expire, so you don't have to use it right away."

SchoolIdolFestival,3e155n,Tricksnyan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:37:39 2015 UTC,I really just want mermaid Nozomi 😩 thought about rerolling my account till I got her but I just don't really know how everyone does it so fast and what not
SchoolIdolFestival,3e155n,Yumacaroni,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:40:36 2015 UTC,"The way I do it (which is pretty fast, I guess):   Make as many accounts as you want (I normally make 10-30), and as soon as you make them leave them there. Just leave them, don't play on them, don't go on story, just leave and make the next one. Next day reset (the time where you get the login bonus/dailies change), go back on each one, roll the scouting ticket and maybe 5 loveca depending on promos (now's a great time: loveca promos on both servers), leave the account and go to the next. Repeat the previous step next day and so on until you run out of the new player bonus 30 loveca.   That's how I got 2 URs so far! And I only started rerolling like 1 week ago. It only takes a maximum of 30sec per account so it shouldn't take you long either. The only bad thing is having to wait for the player bonus to come on the next reset, but there's no way to avoid that."
SchoolIdolFestival,3e155n,Yumacaroni,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:08:43 2015 UTC,But how do you make so many at one time? I guess that's what I don't really get 😕 and I guess I don't really get the love gems part. Do you wait the full 10 days or just roll as soon as you have 5?
SchoolIdolFestival,3e155n,Yumacaroni,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:21:18 2015 UTC,"There's a tutorial around here somewhere! But here's a tl;dr version.   Download BlueStacks Download the .apk of the SIF you want (JP, EN, TW, KR, you get the idea) Install it on BlueStacks Download Root Browser (an app for android) Run SIF, create an account After you choose your best girl, skip the tutorial & close the game Run Root Browser Go on data > data > klb.android.lovelive (or klb.android.lovelive_en if you're using the EN version) > shared_prefs Find a file named ""GameEngineActivity.xml"" Rename that file to whatever you want, I normally name mine as ""GameEngineActivity1.xml"", ""GameEngineActivity.xml2"", etc. to keep track of my accounts and then name them ""GameEngineActivity SR NICO.xml"" for example if I get a SR Nico. ""GameEngineActivity UR NICO.xml"" if i get an UR Nico, etc. Run SIF again, create new account Repeat last 2 steps as many times as you need! When you're ready to go back to that account, rename the account you want back to ""GameEngineActivity.xml"" and run SIF.   And nah, you don't have to wait 10 full days to start rerolling. Like I said, after you create an account the next reset should be good enough to roll 2 solos. Then you keep checking on it everyday if you wanna roll 1 solo per day. You can, however, wait 10 days until you get the 30 gems + scouting ticket and THEN roll everything in one go. I'm not pacient enough though so I just do it on the next day.  I know it sounds complicated but it really isn't! Once you have BlueStacks, SIF and Root Browser, it gets really easy."
SchoolIdolFestival,3e155n,Yumacaroni,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:07:44 2015 UTC,"And to get back to the other accounts that I've created. How do I do that? I'm so sorry I'm bombarding you with questions ;.; do I just rename it back to what the account was called and bam, it picks up with that account? And I think I read something about app syncing. Bad thing?"
SchoolIdolFestival,3e155n,lygodium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:11:21 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about asking me stuff haha I was pretty confused when I first joined the subreddit too :P  Yeah, you just rename it back to ""GameEngineActivity.xml"" and the game will go back to the account you desire!  The thing about app syncing? You mean like syncing your account to Google+? Yeah, that's a thing you do if you wanna play on 2 accounts at the same time in the same device, but it only works on JP.  Basically, you go on settings (3rd button of the first row) and there should be an orange button and a pink button.  The pink button allows you to sync an account with a Google+ email. I have 2 emails, so I have 2 accounts on JP, for example. Basically, you click on the pink button and It'll show you a list of the emails you have on your device. You choose one and the button will turn blue. You can sync as many emails as you like, but you can only sync one account per email so be careful!  The orange button lets you change between emails. You press it and much like the pink/blue button it gives you a list of the emails you have on your device. You choose one, and depending if you have an account synced to it, it will reset the game and log onto that email, making it pretty easy to switch between main accounts and side accounts."

First thing that I should clarify. I'm practicing on switching back and forth between 2 accounts. Should I overwrite the existing file or...?
SchoolIdolFestival,3e155n,StarlightGoddess,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:26:02 2015 UTC,"No problem y u y  By the way, if you plan on having 2 JP accounts, be careful with the Google+ thing! I already lost one account because I forgot to sync it on one of my emails and when I tried to go back it was already thrown in the abyss. orz  Make sure to sync your account before switching to another one, or at least have your transfer code written out somewhere. And good luck with your rerolling!~~"

SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,Equus01,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:58:33 2015 UTC,"Statistically, you would probably gain more from spending the loveca to T2 since you would probably be spending less than 50 to get the T2 and you're guaranteed 2 SR's (or an idolized SR).  Sure you have a CHANCE for a UR (or two) but the odds are against you.

SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,jirachiex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:52 2015 UTC,I T2'd right after I started. You get a lot of LP from ranking up more quickly.

SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,Equus01,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:07:29 2015 UTC,The funny thing is that you'd only need a few more loveca at rank 26 to T2 than I would at rank 83 because you'd be leveling up like mad.  To get around 30k event points would probably cost you around 30-35 loveca and put you at or near level 50 if you did Hard 4x songs.  So it's kinda up to you if you want to save for the 10+1 or go for basically a guaranteed idolized SR.  :)

Don't force yourself to play hard if you can't pull it off well (especially the event song since they're generally harder).  If you can't play 15 LP hard songs, any song will work fine difficulty wise for collecting tokens (15 LP and higher have an extra token note in them).

SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,Kurotsuhi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:36:35 2015 UTC,"Really? I thought that was the normal amount. In the last token event I remember spending around that much to maintain my rank. Right now I have 73 lp,  so assuming the cutoff is 30000 (that's what everyone said),  the calculator said I need about 20 gems if I want to reach it in one go. So if I substract that with the remaining days left... It would probably be 10 gems minimum... But then, just to be safe,  15 gems it is. I haven't calculate it properly since I can't find my calculator. So is that more or less correct?"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,Suicidal-Panda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:24:25 2015 UTC,30k is a bit high.  none of the events have reached that since tiers started expanding after the 41k bloodbath in december.  25k is a more realistic estimate to go on until real ones come out tomorrow/thursday.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,Kurotsuhi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:28:16 2015 UTC,"Yess, now I know I can at least make it, thanks! Still, 30k and 25k isn't that far apart. I'll just burn 10 gems and see how it goes :3  41k now that's a lot... aa Nico, that's understandable."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,Suicidal-Panda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:37:25 2015 UTC,"Actually it was umi, who I think is slightly less popular than nico as far as I can tell (which isn't much).  Multitude of reasons leading to it: during christmas break so many more had the time to tier, had a large amount of bonus gems (kotori UR promo came out with it and I think one of the 9's birthday is there too), and much smaller tiers than now."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,Kurotsuhi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:03:29 2015 UTC,"Oh last year Umi EN event, I thought it was last year Nico JP event haha my bad >w<"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,Suicidal-Panda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:10 2015 UTC,JP and EN are far too different (I think tiers are 10x size difference rofl) to really ever be compared.  (Also popularity varies on servers).
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,WikY28,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:10 2015 UTC,Oh god. I didn't tier for the last 2 events because my smile and cool teams were strong enough. But my pure team really needs this. Definitely going to get T2 this time.  Good luck everyone!
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,arthurhilton,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:32:08 2015 UTC,how do u people tier? its so hard! i can barely touch event songs in hard mode also!
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,Suicidal-Panda,2,Mon Jul 20 21:17:22 2015 UTC,"You don't have to do hard songs if you can't handle them yet.  The only way to tier 1 or 2 is to use love gems (and to lose sleep if you're too low of a rank).  The less time spent with max LP, the less gems used.  While hard/expert is slightly more efficent, it's not a x2 type thing; more of a 1.25 more thing at best."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,arthurhilton,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:37:51 2015 UTC,"oh well, if u put it that way, sounds like im gonna have to go in with the LP! lmaoo thanks though"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,XaloPG,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:10:59 2015 UTC,Anyone have any idea what the point cut off for T1 will be? I want to know about how many points a day I should be getting.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,Sprites7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:46:40 2015 UTC,I'll T2 her as usual
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,Phantomofhearts,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:52:39 2015 UTC,"I'm excited for this one, I'm going to try my best to get T2! :)"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,mangojams,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:27:00 2015 UTC,Yes my second kotori event! I'm aiming to T2! These set of cards are sooo beautiful! I'm so close to having an idolized SR + UR only pure team.. soon..
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,NozomiPowah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:18:53 2015 UTC,The unidolized version is gorgeous. Not tiering this time around!
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,Illyasvieru,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:31:39 2015 UTC,You can just get to T1 and have both versions!
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,juungi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:29:13 2015 UTC,Good luck to everyone trying to tier for this event. Going to go for T2 on this one. Cannot resist score up swimsuit burd.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,hinakura,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:31:14 2015 UTC,So beautiful ♥ I will tier :)
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,ABrandNewHeart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:08:06 2015 UTC,"I might try to T2 this one, but I'm only level 38ish. Is that even doable?"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,luciusftw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:32:41 2015 UTC,"Sure, but be prepared to wake up in the middle of the night to use your LP."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,ABrandNewHeart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:36:15 2015 UTC,Already preparing for that. :')
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,yifflord69,-1,Tue Jul 21 10:21:38 2015 UTC,what would be the recommended rank for T2?
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,Finn_Finite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:09:28 2015 UTC,"People are torn between ""holy cute card this is going to be a bloodbath"" and ""eh Kotori events are snoozefests"" so we really do have no idea. The Japanese event rank cutoff was 35K, with ~31000 points"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,yifflord69,-1,Tue Jul 21 04:12:23 2015 UTC,"If I try to Tier this event, Kotori will be my first Pure SR card (I'm so unlucky right). I'll just buy 50 loveca in case OTL RIP wallet."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,Finn_Finite,2,Tue Jul 21 04:19:37 2015 UTC,"I'd wait at least a day or two into the event to see how things go. For all we know the cutoff might be 15000 points xD Hey, I can hope.  Also don't feel bad, the only reason I have an SR of each color is from the weiss schwarz box. Without that, my only above-rare is the UR Kotori (cool) I rerolled for.  EDIT: and the freebie swimsuit eli"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,luciusftw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:25:01 2015 UTC,"Don't buy 50 loveca yet. Kotori is extremely popular in Japan while she's like average or below average here, and JP events are much more competitive than EN events, AND the tiers expanded right afterwards."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx95z,yifflord69,0,Tue Jul 21 04:44:22 2015 UTC,I think I'll just see how the event will go first before buying like what Finn_Finite said on the previous comment. Thank you for the advise!!
SchoolIdolFestival,3e0u94,sakurayukihime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:18:41 2015 UTC,"As for Bluestacks, what you have to do is never, ever let it finish setting up. It wants to set up app sync and all kinds of things, but if you never do anything it wants you to, it never gives you that message. It just nags you about setting it up. A lot.   Alternately, there are modded versions of Bluestacks that presumably make it much less awful - I can't vouch for any of them specifically but I know they're commonly used by people really into mobile games. It's an alternative, at least.  edit: As for holding your accounts, if you can extract the data to send to someone, you could always just put that data on a flashdrive or an online file storage service if all you want is a place to put it."
SchoolIdolFestival,3e0u94,diracalpha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:25:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah. Never let it app sync, lol. I have to hit escape everytime I've started Bluestacks, but I've also never run into any issues that I experienced when I DID let it app sync/do the other bs it wants to do."
SchoolIdolFestival,3e0u94,rinniex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:27:52 2015 UTC,"I don't only want that- I legit do not have any additional computers to store my data in, and I also want to see if it's a problem with my data or computer itself.  Not let it finish setting it up? Oops ;A;"
SchoolIdolFestival,3e0u94,rinniex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:40:57 2015 UTC,"I also experienced these kind of issues with bluestacks the first time I tried rerolling, so I can definitely sympathise. All I had to do was uninstall it and reinstall everything and it started working fine after that. ( not being able to click the buttons probably has to do with your computer as opposed to the program though)  If you need an account holder, I'm happy to do it (you could also ask a middleman from SIFTrades, they're probably pretty reliable)  Good luck at any rate!"
SchoolIdolFestival,3e0u94,rinniex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:26:37 2015 UTC,"I actually did install and uninstall everything, except my computer still won't run it properly, and it's going to stop working completely at this rate ;A;  Thank you for the suggestion!

SchoolIdolFestival,3e0u94,Phar0_s,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:41:37 2015 UTC,"You can get modded BlueStacks online, that never asks for set-up or purchase. You'll need to install root cloak to run SIF, but it's worth it."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dx6re,arthurhilton,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:19:01 2015 UTC,"While having never switched devices before, the first time I played SIF, I think I got into the swing of things by 5th day. It was when I realized the pace of these easy and normal songs was insulting my fingers and hand/eye coordination honed after years of handheld gaming. I remember getting real overconfident, FC'ing every song I had unlocked by then on Hard, but then WILD STARS showed up..."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx6re,paradiseliving,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:49:32 2015 UTC,WILD STARS ugh I played it around 73 times and only managed to FC it once
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx6re,neobeats,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:34:48 2015 UTC,Three months for me then I started playing EX. It took me a week of constant failures to get it right.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dx6re,KyofushiBibi39,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:58:37 2015 UTC,"i first played SIF on an iphone 6 plus, it was very comfortable, but then i broke my phone, then i had to go back to my old phone, a galaxy s2, it was HELL. i had to give up, it lagged and turned out to be really uncomfortable to play since i have big hands. Now i have a Galaxy Grand Max and its really fast and big enough to play. My only issue is my long notes dont register correctly sometimes and that wrecks my combo, but everythings good now! took about two months of trial and error to get a good device. If you all need a good big affordable phone, with a fast processor and a thin layout for games, the Galaxy Grand Max is probably one of the best ones out there."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dx6re,Asphyria,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:30:38 2015 UTC,Before I play the game... obviously I get into that game because I saw my little brother playing it and by just watching I already know the basic concept of the game XD

SchoolIdolFestival,3dwska,sakurayukihime,4,Tue Jul 21 04:06:44 2015 UTC,Probably 9 days lol ;w; or maybe 8... not enough time to play hnngg
SchoolIdolFestival,3dwska,sakurayukihime,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:44:43 2015 UTC,ah so you rarely aim to tier on events?

SchoolIdolFestival,3dwska,Fiyachan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:52:28 2015 UTC,I got Apparition Nico in the first 6 hours. I had the night off work for once so I could play fairly quickly

SchoolIdolFestival,3dwska,loved-potato,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:43:07 2015 UTC,probably 2 days. (i sleep for 10 hours okay...) for this honoka on en. tried to tier 1 but stopped playing like 4 days through the event (highest i got was around rank 300 ;_; then ended up 40 places away from tier 2...)  edit: checked my screencaps and got the sr around 32 hours after the event...
SchoolIdolFestival,3dwska,luciusftw,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:09:07 2015 UTC,ouch that was close ;w; but for token events it's pretty fast though

SchoolIdolFestival,3dwska,paradiseliving,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:22:50 2015 UTC,4-5 hours would be my fastest time.

SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,luciusftw,22,Sun Jul 19 06:00:56 2015 UTC,"Every Nozomi fan in the world just got Umizoned again.  I'm very unimpressed by this card btw... the unidolized version looks cute, but it's only ok. A bit disappointing considering that Umi usually gets really good event cards."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,ItsSoldierGame,9,Sun Jul 19 06:12:30 2015 UTC,yeah i wonder why they tend to put umi in tacky clothes for her idolized srs :(
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,evilbride,3,Sun Jul 19 06:50:55 2015 UTC,I was looking forward for Nozomi too...
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,Honomizu,5,Sun Jul 19 06:19:46 2015 UTC,"Nozomi just had a UR released and Umi was the last event for last round, it not surprising tbh."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,ikudon,3,Sun Jul 19 06:25:16 2015 UTC,There use to be a UR Umi and then an Umi event afterwards so...?
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,Tricksnyan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:20:51 2015 UTC,"And that event ends with a low cutoff, I'm not saying that it is not possible but it definitely more unlikely."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,ikudon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:46:11 2015 UTC,"What's this about low cutoffs? Weren't you trying to say that since UR Nozomi came out, it shouldn't be a Nozomi event on JP?"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,Tricksnyan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:25:51 2015 UTC,"I'm saying that it's rare for a event to come after a UR release of a same character, not that it's impossible."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,ikudon,4,Sun Jul 19 08:35:49 2015 UTC,"At the same time last year Nozomi literally had her mermaid UR released right after her score match and since it's been a pretty long time since her last event + she doesn't have a medfes yet, a lot of people predicted a nozomi medfes. It wouldn't be surprising if it was her either... It's kinda funny how the situation with the marine URs with everyone expecting Nozomi to come first and then getting Umi repeated itself in a way."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,ItsSoldierGame,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:32:04 2015 UTC,"While many predicted a Nozomi medfes, considering how both Rin and Nozomi has a solo bluray song, they have a higher chance of being the token event compare to Umi who has a duet song, since both Umi and Nozomi were score match last round, the score match slot goes to Rin this round which leaves Umi/Nozomi with medfes/token."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,Fiyachan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:10:32 2015 UTC,"Wait, does this mean that they're both also grouped with the Nico event after this Kotori one which is also a swimsuit version card?"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,Ruaichuu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:13:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know for the Nico one, I'm pretty certain that She and Kotori is grouped for this one. Nico? Klab can do a Nozomi/Rin & Nico pair in event I suppose."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,Fiyachan,2,Sun Jul 19 06:22:00 2015 UTC,"Lucius said below that the card is actually Retro Pop Umi, so I think we're both wrong, oops"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,lygodium,5,Sun Jul 19 06:24:39 2015 UTC,"Highly likely the last two events will be Pure Nozomi w/ her blueray song for the token, then Cool Rin for the score match. (I'd put money on the Rin beng a perfect locker, too.)  Unless KLab wants to have 3 smile event songs in a row. But hey, I'm not judging."

I have my fingers crossed for Loveless World or Loneliest Baby, personally. And I'm pretty sure the one on August 1st will be Koi no Signal Rin Rin Rin; they seem to be putting up SID event songs that match that round's new expert's attribute. Boy, that was a mouthful."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,ItsSoldierGame,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:25:47 2015 UTC,Nozomi could be a cool card too since lately klab hasn't been matching the token songs' attributes with the cards attributes. I feel like she'll be a cool card since her last two event SRs were pure...
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,lygodium,3,Sun Jul 19 06:14:54 2015 UTC,"Rin has never had a cool event card; based on the trend with Kotori & Umi getting their first smile event card, Eli getting her first pure event card, and Nico getting her first cool event card, Rin will almost certainly be cool."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,Yumiiro,5,Sun Jul 19 06:37:30 2015 UTC,"I so agree about her UR card. I was so relieved to get the Nozomi instead of Umi, because her unidolized version looks like some 40 year old housewife serving drinks to all of her husband's coworkers."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,Ruaichuu,2,Sun Jul 19 13:23:46 2015 UTC,"UGH, jealous, I ended up with Umi on my main lol (plus she's a healer fml)  She doesn't even look like herself in that UR! I'm really hoping they might go back and redraw at least her head so it looks better."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,Pink-Crayons,2,Sun Jul 19 06:19:31 2015 UTC,Why is the unidolized card better than the idolized one?
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,Wiizel1337,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:56:02 2015 UTC,i also wonder that as well tbh
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,KawaiiEli,2,Sun Jul 19 07:09:16 2015 UTC,Not such a fan of the idolised version so the unidolised will do. Not that I would have time to tier anyway since I'm already tiering for Kotori on EN.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,SpiritualPower,2,Sun Jul 19 07:26:32 2015 UTC,"It's time again! The idolized card doesn't look very good, but I'll try my best. This would be my first time tiering a MedFest and my first smile Umi!  I stacked up lovecas and gold just in time for this, haah... I'm also reinstalling SIF to get rid of the old Story data for the best performance. Wise decisions were made at the best time."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,iLyrica-sama,3,Sun Jul 19 08:20:21 2015 UTC,"Unidolized >>>> Idolized. Ahh, finally some sleep~"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,SpiritualPower,2,Sun Jul 19 13:58:17 2015 UTC,I'm actually pretty glad that this isn't a Nozomi event. I'm too tired from the last EN event and I'm low on loveca in JP.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,I-need-a-UR,2,Sun Jul 19 15:16:53 2015 UTC,"Another tacky idolized card? I like the retro style, but there's a reason why that fashion died. xD  The N Girl will probably pull it off better."

I don't think it'll be one of those events where I'd tier (I need to save loveca anyway). I love Umi, but... the idolized is kinda eh, I still more or less like it. The Unidolized, however, is pretty. ♥  And yay for a smile card, I can kick out my 1 R when I get her."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,mangojams,2,Sun Jul 19 16:28:31 2015 UTC,Woohoo my first MedFes and it's Umi :3 I'm glad it wasn't Nozomi cuz my JP account is still kinda new and I won't be able to tier.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,Honomizu,2,Sun Jul 19 20:09:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same here, that's why I haven't been doing so well in the last few JP events because my account is still VERY new! xD Good luck to both of us, though! We'll get there! :3"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,QuackAttack21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:13:13 2015 UTC,Thanks! I wish you the best of luck ^ I managed to get the completion reward Eli SR in the last event. Hopefully we'll do great in this one!
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,Fiyachan,2,Mon Jul 20 06:32:06 2015 UTC,The unidolized looks a lot better than the idolized :o
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,shiinamachi,2,Sun Jul 19 21:02:12 2015 UTC,I hope I can get her unidolized. I'm also trying to get the SR Kotori for the EN event. This is going to be harder when I'm on a cruise in the middle of the ocean. D:  My sister can't wait until this Umi event happens on EN. Umi is her best girl and she loves the retro look of the idolized version. XD

SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,milesmitsurugi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:23:09 2015 UTC,oh man. I just started playing on the JP server the other day. Is tier 2 reasonably doable at level 31 now? I've never done medley before.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,evilbride,2,Sun Jul 19 06:21:08 2015 UTC,"It's easier at a low rank if you don't waste LP (and not wasting LP is going to SUCK) because you'll level up every five seconds. Medfes appear to have higher cutoffs but you also get a lot more points per LP, so this is actually a good thing since T2 will potentially hit 80k (11 day event) and you'll get the 3 loveca refund."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,evilbride,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:23:55 2015 UTC,"If you have loveca, it's possible. Unfortunately, Medley Festivals generally have the highest cut offs... I don't see many people below rank 90 Tiering on Medley Festivals which is really unfortunate for beginners.  At the very least, the event gives good EXP if you have gold so you have that going for you."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,wonderful-rush,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:22:54 2015 UTC,"i recommend being at least rank 70 because you will have enough LP to do 3EX, which really makes a lot of difference in tiering imo. also by doing the math you'll only need 15 loveca to hit 80k if you get A score / A combo in MF, without burning LP, assuming rank 70 at the start and buying the event point powerup all the way (you can and will be able to afford this because 3EX nets you 10800 gold reward and the powerup is 10k, sell off some cards to ensure you wont run out of money).  for rank 31 you'll only need 12 loveca assuming B/B on 2EX (costs 40LP, you barely make it) and event point powerup, but you basically need to sell off whatever you get from the MF and play every 4 hours (i.e. rip sleep). if you can wake up every 4 hours to clear LP then yeah you should be ok, lol"

SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,RinRinRingABell,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:29:39 2015 UTC,any prediction of how many love gems needed for t1/t2?
SchoolIdolFestival,3dt8yq,Krisader,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:50:06 2015 UTC,Umi's events in JP seem to be average to below average... so a generous estimate of 80k would take 17 loveca at rank 125. You'll get 13 of that back tho.

At least I am apathetic to the idolized card design or I would be kicking myself to the end of the event.

I want this account because:   It has a UR of each at attribute ASDFGHJKL So many SRs such beauty I'm not going to let it rot I will actually use the account PROPERLY   My best girl is Maki and Eli. Don't make me choose.  I would probably give this account to my sister, since she's never gotten more than 1 UR in a while in her main ;w; Thank you!  Just as a suggestion, I still think you should try to eliminate beggars from your giveaway, unless you don't care that it goes to someone who won't take care of it properly, these are the rules I recommend:   account must be at least 2 months old  account must have at least 10 karma must not majorly post in giveaway threads   Unless you're okay with your account going to /u/PotatoofCake's new account or whatnot, of course.  Thank you for considering!"

Well, I really want this account because I would like to start the JP version of the game now that I feel up to playing more than one accounts again, and also the account have a lot of my liked Idols(Maki, Nozomi, Kotori, Eli are my top few). Having pretty URs also allow me to stay more interested in the game. My absolute favorite idol is a tie between Nozomi and Eli(they also make a cute pair IMO), not only by appearance but their voice is the nicest too~  If I get the account I'll play it for sure, this is by far the best account I will have, and will be what I play in the JP version all the time."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dtniv,Noctiee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:35:41 2015 UTC,"I would love to enter, this is a fantastic account!  My reason for wanting to win is that I have a bit of an addiction to SIF, and I love leveling up accounts. I've been looking for a decent account to do some rank grinding, and this seems perfect!   My best girl is Kotori, and I love that Yukata UR of her, the pink suits her quite well. She is my best girl because of her cute and unique personality, and her voice!   Thank you very much for this opportunity and good luck to everyone!"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dtniv,lamento236,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:49:52 2015 UTC,"I'm entering!

I recently revived a new account from a very kind person out there, except my other teams are very weak, and my scout ended in 1 SR!   My best girl is Kotori, of course! She's adorable and she's so enthusiastic! She's also very talented and helps out the other muse members when they're down.  I would absolutely make this account my new main ASAP. What a beautiful account! Who wouldn't?  I also suggest giveaway restrictions! Like in other giveaways around here. Thank you!!"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dtniv,YumiYumiYuu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:24:31 2015 UTC,Ohh man I want this account since it has my two favorite girls Maki and Kotori cause Maki is so talented and beautiful and Kotori is adorable and kind! And it even has a UR in each attribute! If I got this I would make it my main account and love it and cherish it and watch it grow up
SchoolIdolFestival,3dtniv,zzblackhawkzz,0,Sun Jul 19 14:39:07 2015 UTC,"I'd love to enter in this goldmine of an account.  My favorite girl is stuck between eli and maki, but a lil' more for eli since her VA (nanjou) really caught my attention.

Plus I've never had an account with the Valentines Nozomi which I like quite a lot. It also has the military event Maki which I don't have on my main unfortunately Q///Q   I would cherish it as my JP side account. In all honesty I think others would deserve this account more than me, especially if they don't have a JP account so far, it would be a great opportunity for them to start into it! I wanted to give it a try though because of my precious waifu Maki adfjafhasflks and this beautiful Nozomi on one account haaa >///<"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dtniv,YueYuki,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:16:11 2015 UTC,"I'd like to enter for this account!  This is actually a very appealing account to me because it's balanced (1 UR for every attribute !!), it has a bunch of cards that I adore (V-Day Maki, September Kotori, the Easter Kotori, Marine Hanayo + Kotori), and I have yet to roll a UR on JP so this would give me the motivation to be active on the server instead of going on once per day for bonuses.  My favourite girl is Maki since I identify with her a lot. I'm not rich lol nor am I musically inclined but I feel the same pressure from my parents to work in an area I don't have any passion for and (in my case) live in a country I have no desire to live in. I also have the same birthday as her, which is super cool. Of course, I can't just pick one girl, so my other favourites are Kotori (she's just so cute I can't not love her. She also has the best cards imo), Nozomi (I'm not quite sure why, she's just really grown on me since the last SM on EN for some reason), and Hanayo (again, very cute and gentle and I love her a lot). All of the idols are amazing though~  I'd definitely make this my main account (who wouldn't?), and look to idolize one of the cards (preferably the Kotori UR one, but I feel like that won't ever happen lol) as well as make this account better than it already is. I'll make sure I contact you when I scout a UR (if you want)~   Thank you for putting this account in a giveaway, and thank you even more for the effort you put into getting all those cards. Have a great day!"

I need a second account to play with, since the Idol hell will never let me go, so better play more! Maybe someday I'll become tired of this and I may escape from the hell (Impossible, but dreaming is free <3)  My favourite Idol is Nozomi-chan! I love everything about this wonderful girl, I wrote some poem about her (Not true) and I think she's just the best <3  First, I love her voice, many many many people think that her voice is ""horrible, noisy and other things"" but I find her voice cute and sweet! I love when she sings her solos and with Lilywhite, she just needs her spaces, that's all.  Then, she's sooo cute! Come on, she's cute and so adorable! I love her, kyaaaah! I may become gay for her! (Just kidding :P)  I'm going to play with this account like a second main, simple. I'm now playing with my new account which I found rerolling (An account with 2 URs, now it has also got 3 SRs) and another would be perfect!  Thank you for making this and I hope to win!

If I got this acc I will certainly play it a lot and take good care of it! Having nice teams will also keep me interested in playing so don't worry I'll get bored of it !

I just had to say that first. :) But the main reason why I wish to win this account is mainly the reason because I have NO, ABSOLUTE NO SR/UR OF KOTORI!! :( She's my favorite, and both on my JP & EN account have no cards of her. She's really someone who I am to be someday, cheesy enough. Someone who is positive, girly, and is very close to her friends. I wish to strive to be such as a nice and amazing girl like her. Always trying to put a smile on everyone's, a lot like Honoka too, but I feel like her way of approaching someone to make them feel better is more connecting.  What I plan to do? Well, I suppose just like with any other user. Continue to play to their hearts content! I found this game because of its a rhythm game, and I adore them! I'm planning to play this game as much as I can for as long as I can. Have to keep those waifus in check, heh! Thanks again for giving away such an account like this, wow! Good luck to others too, and everyone have a nice day :)<3"

Idk. I keep mine off, because they cause too much lag when they pop up. I do keep effects on though - I find a quick glance at the colour of my combo count is less distracting than obsessively keeping track of the number."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dtj2m,Fruset,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:29:24 2015 UTC,I usually have the animations on during down time because I don't have any incentive to get FC everytime I play a song other than if it's a 11 star that I have'nt gotten FC on yet.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dtj2m,YukiRikou,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:31:31 2015 UTC,Full during downtimes when I'm not actively trying to FC something or during Token collection.  Off when I'm grinding the Token Event song and during Score Matches.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dtj2m,AlchyTimesThree,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:08:51 2015 UTC,I've always played on full. I like seeing my idols pop up on the screen. And then miss a note by staring at my idols for too long.

SchoolIdolFestival,3dsfhl,lygodium,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:07:32 2015 UTC,So apparently it's impossible to get 10 rares from a 1k friend pts scouting!?
SchoolIdolFestival,3dsfhl,Limoenchen,2,Sun Jul 19 01:17:02 2015 UTC,"Not impossible, just so damn small it might as well be 0%."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dsfhl,Finn_Finite,2,Sun Jul 19 01:18:44 2015 UTC,"I've only ever seen people get 3 rares - I would wager that 4 or 5 rares is possible, but 5 rares is so uncommon that it's probably in the range of the likelihood of getting 3 URs in a single pull - which is possible, I've done it, but it's a super long shot."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dsfhl,lygodium,3,Sun Jul 19 02:12:17 2015 UTC,One time I got 5 Rares in a 1k Friend Scouting.. I would prefer this kind of luck when it comes to getting more than one SR or maybe a UR.. .___.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dsfhl,Finn_Finite,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:40:48 2015 UTC,Just today I got four rares from a 7 card pull. The odds of that are pretty darn bad lol.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dsfhl,lygodium,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:09:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the odds of getting 4 rares from 10 cards is around one in a thousand - 4 from 7 is one in five thousand or so. Congrats though! I've gotten 3 rares a handful of times myself, but never more than that."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dsfhl,saymunZz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:43:37 2015 UTC,You never know! I've gotten quite a large number of URs across my two accounts - 14 10+1s have yielded 6 URs (and 13 SRs) for me.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dsfhl,saymunZz,2,Sun Jul 19 05:09:30 2015 UTC,"I only got 3 Rs as in 1k friend points scouting and that only happens once. I got 2R for a while and 1 R too, and no R for most of them :/"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dsfhl,saymunZz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:32:04 2015 UTC,Just wondering if this is only for calculating the probability of a single 10+1 roll? Because putting a number greater than 11 in the first input seems to decreases the probability.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dsfhl,lygodium,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:17:53 2015 UTC,It's for any number of scouts. Mind telling me what variables you put in? I have a maybe-explination. :P

SchoolIdolFestival,3dsfhl,-NINCOMPOOP-,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:24:14 2015 UTC,"You scout 88 times, and get 1 UR and 87 rares. No SRs.   The chances of you getting 7 scouts with nothing but Rs and 1 scout with 10 Rs and 1 UR is 0.0009%."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dsfhl,-NINCOMPOOP-,2,Sun Jul 19 01:43:57 2015 UTC,"If you want to know the odds of doing 88 scouts and getting at least one UR, you need to just find the odds of the reverse outcome - scouting 88 scouts and getting no URs, which is (.99)88, or around 41%. So the odds of getting at least one UR is 100%-41% = 59%."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dsfhl,Finn_Finite,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:13:44 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to wrap my head around this: the chances of getting a single UR in a 10+1 is ~4%, but the chances of getting at least a UR by 11 scouts is ~10%? Is the 10% all UR positive percentages added up? Sorry to bother, it's just that my mind has been buzzing with math all day and you seem to have the answers. xD"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dsfhl,Finn_Finite,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:00:45 2015 UTC,"You're mistaking at least one for exactly one. Yes, the 10% is adding up all UR positive percentages. And don't worry about bothering me! Stats can be a bit of a minefield at times."

It also seems like the Chinese-language wikia agrees with my opinion on Anemone Heart EX vs Mermaid Festa vol 2 ~Passionate~ EX  About Anemone Heart EX:    EX比Hard良心系列，应该是二期超难EX中最好打的了。只是400combo+左右的单边连击需要注意，很容易跪……   Translation   EX is actually easier than Hard, and could possibly be the easiest among the 2nd EX series. Just be careful of the alternating single taps at notes 400+: it's easy to trip up there...   About Mermaid Festa vol 2 ~Passionate~ EX:    在继承Hard难度的蛋疼四连打的基础上还衍生出了许多变式以至于数量达到了40+且整体难度上升不少，再加上双手甩鞭子式的谱面绝对是沙包通向触手必过的一个难关！   Translation   Continuing with the difficulty of Hard mode's single-stroke 4-tap groupings, there are also up to 40+ different style shifts which up the difficulty even more. Add that to the two-handed whip-style sections (the one I called the ""crab dance"") and it's a force to be reckoned with!"

SchoolIdolFestival,3dpf0g,paperairplaneclub,21,Sat Jul 18 04:23:30 2015 UTC,"These steps will only work for TOKEN events. You have been warned.  1- Do prior preparation. Before the event starts, manage your EXP bar in such a way that you would rank up in, for instance, 3 EX songs during the event.  2- Be LP efficient. Use gems only when you have 0-2 LP remaining.   3- Keep a close eye on the EXP bar. If you are going to rank up in, say, 50 EXP, with only 2 LP left, play the Event song instead of wasting a gem.  4- Don't be afraid to use gems. But you should NOT use them if you are about to rank up soon.  5- Take breaks. For me, I like to schedule my breaks with the acquiring of the event cards... Like I would take breaks after getting the Event N, Alpaca, etc...  6- Maintain your tier. Spend at least 2 gems a day to maintain your tier. But depending on when you got the Event SR and the tier that you are aiming for, you may need to spend lesser gems than that.  7- Don't overestimate/underestimate the Final day Rush. On most occasions, the event tiers would make a sudden leap of about 1 000 points, which is commonly seen in Bloodbath events cough December Umi cough. To avoid getting kicked out of the tier at the last minute, try to keep at least 1 500 points above the cutoff. At the same time though, try not to overestimate the Rush. I've spent like 3-5 gems on the final day of the Soldier Maki event on JP, fearing for my rank, only to find out that the cutoff for my desired tier (T1) was LOWER than the amount of points that I had 4 hours prior to the end of the event.  8- Try to spend all of your tokens before the event ends. They are not going to be carried forward into the next token event, so why not spend them all (and get about 200 more points in the process)?  So with that, good luck with tiering for the Maki event! See you in the top tiers! ヾ(´∀｀)ﾉ"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dpf0g,Ahoahoaho,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:53:25 2015 UTC,"aho's pretty much hit all the good stuff.  I like to wait till ""near the end"" before using gems so each gem has the most LP it can give (at my rank I usually only get +1 LP to max, but at lower ranks you'll want to start gemming a few days early).  Another thing I like to do is save my tokens for when I'm near ranking up, so I can rank up during the day instead of at 3 AM."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dpf0g,Suicidal-Panda,16,Sat Jul 18 13:36:33 2015 UTC,Dont play EX when it's 4am. It wont end well.

SchoolIdolFestival,3dpf0g,junglehunter3,5,Sat Jul 18 06:41:14 2015 UTC,"I mean, normally I try and keep up with the T2 cutoff (or T1 if I'm trying to T1) throughout the entire event. Trying to rush 30k points in a score match event on the last day is silly. If you space out your loveca usage it's a lot more bearable.  Also be efficient with your free LP. Try not to let your bar fillup."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dpf0g,GL1TCH3D,5,Sat Jul 18 04:26:03 2015 UTC,"I am the builder of the T1/T2 automatic predictor:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gT26kLl2jAQGX9xn9VRAYwnk5gzKWpe-NkOJa7osI8Y/pubhtml?gid=648200897&single=true  It is possible to tier T2 in every single event and as a f2p to boot. I started (and tiered) with the December Umi bloodbath and have gotten every card since then save samurai Umi which I missed by 20 points.   If you want to spend the bare minimum number of love gems but yet still stay sane, follow what I do:   Look at the number of points that each tier climbs on the very last day on average. At the end of each day, you want to be that number of points above the cutoff."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dpf0g,Vivo999,6,Sat Jul 18 08:39:09 2015 UTC,"Give up any semblance of a life you have for the 10ish days that the event is going on.   But really, the important stuff has been mentioned. Never have full LP and schedule things around using it. Always refer to the cutoff estimates that people post here and aim at least 1k above, and play through the last hour of the event. Expect to spend love gems - the less time you can play, the more gems you should have on hand to spend when you have the time to play to make up for it. If you're right at the cutoff toward the end, expect that you won't make tier and play more to get yourself in a safer spot. There are too many sad stories about people who thought they were safe only to get kicked out of T2 at the last second.  EDIT: Forgot to mention, for the token events, if you can handle playing that darn event song hundreds of times, it's better to do that rather than wait for the 4x version to come out. You get more experience and more level-ups doing the grind work (which means, more LP to spend)."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dpf0g,pietaro,2,Sat Jul 18 08:07:04 2015 UTC,"I always set myself a quota, and have a good idea of what the cut off is going to be  For example, Score Matches are usually around 65-75k cut offs, with a few outliers.  Save up your loveca/love gems and use them appropriately, and as gl1tch3d mentioned, don't let your LP bar fill up if possible.  Usually I try and get the card in the first two days. That'll get me safe into the Tier 2 zone and then I can go from there depending on where I want to go. But obviously, if you can't freely get loveca/love gems, then you'll probably go for the first 3-4 days getting the card and then just trying to play whenever you can."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dpf0g,Fiyachan,2,Sat Jul 18 04:29:37 2015 UTC,"If you have less than 70 stamina, life can be pretty hard. For the most part all you really need to do is make sure your stamina never sits at full and to make sure that you're pacing yourself towards a goal that will be within the cutoffs. BasakaNZ's event tracking posts are very accurate throughout an event and by aiming for 1000 or 2000 points above the expected cutoffs will pay off nicely. The SIF calculator is another great tool that will tell you how much loveca you'll need to use in order to hit a certain goal (assuming you are min/maxing your stamina)."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dpf0g,luciusftw,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:08:47 2015 UTC,"I have to say, as someone else who failed to T2 once before by just a hundred points or so, I learned a lot. As said already, be efficient with your LP and make sure your bar doesn't fill up. Level up wisely too because that's an added boost. Keep an eye on tier cut offs. Use the event calculator so you know in advance what you will be spending to get where you want to be. Pace yourself and try not to rush at the end (or necessarily at the beginning and burn yourself out unless you're confident you won't do that). I'm pretty SIF noob-y too but this is just what I have picked up from tiering since my previous failure. Also if you're anywhere near tier cutoff, stay up until the event is over if you can or set your alarm and wake up 30-45m before the end. I have done this for every event since and managed to tier, but I usually had to bulk up on more points at the end (like the Eli event last month where I thought 25.5k would be safe but ended up having to push to 26.5k at the end, iirc)."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dpf0g,juungi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:32:02 2015 UTC,"If you just barely failed, try and keep an eye on the cutoffs at the end of the event and try to be very ahead of it, even if it might mean staying up late (I've stayed up to 4 AM sometimes for these events, which is brutal for me), the hourly increases tend to jump a lot more than you might expect.  Read the prediction/tracking threads. The predictors have done a really good job getting the cutoffs right.  Try to aim a good 2k-3k ahead of it to be safe. I pretty much don't even look at the cutoffs until the last few hours, and plan to hit what the predictors are saying from the start.  Manage time wisely, and don't let your LP bar stay full; this will mean less gems go into grinding.  Try not to grind all at once; it burns you out real easily.  Don't risk it. If it looks like you may or may not need another gem, spend the gem, or another one. It's better to lose one or two extra gems then it is to not get your card idolize.  Make sure you have enough gems too. It'd be a shame to go through all that effort to not have enough gems.  I think that's all I have to say..."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dpf0g,luciusftw,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:50:58 2015 UTC,"I never shoot for T2 before (new person here :D ) but gonna try for the next event. my only advice is: never let the LP bar fill up, always check the prediction thread, don't try to use all Lovecas at the end because you will freak out, wake up 45+ before the event end.   My main account is EN so it should be easier. If you are shooting for T2 in JP then you will need more lovecas and possibly make your own predictions :P good luck to you and to all people (including me xD) for the T2 madness!  and also, don't be too heartbreaking about Loveca usages. T2 usually needs 10-15(or 20?) lovecas, which is almost equal to an idolized SR (2 solo scout) and you still get Lovecas back in the event so :P [information from /u/beta35 ]"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dpf0g,Helen_wenwen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:55:48 2015 UTC,"Grind early. On the first day spend about 14 loveca to start with on the first day, don't spend tokens until EX/X4 or if you need to level up and you miscalculated. Then play normally until the second to last day. If you see that you're dropping below estimated cutoffs, spend more loveca. If you don't, then just continue to play normally. That's what I usually do and it turns out fine."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dpf0g,AFKNH,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:06:39 2015 UTC,"I set a quota that I wanted to hit, for example, 5 or 6k every day. On the last day, the predicted cutoff should be pretty accurate, so just look at the amount of points you already have, and it's up to you whether you want to spend more love gems or not.  EDIT: Also, save up tons of loveca in preparation. My friend and I started with the same amount of loveca, but she fell out of T2 at the end. It's a bit unpredictable how many points you can get from one loveca, so save."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dpf0g,wind_7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:07:03 2015 UTC,"If you're cheap with loveca (like me), when you've used up most of your LP and have like, for example, 10 LP left, but you're most efficient difficulty mode is hard - wait for it to hit 15, play hard, and then use a loveca. Gotta manage time a bit and it doesn't seem like a large difference in points - but it can save you a loveca or 2 in the long run.  Spend early/evenly. Check the tier predictions of the SIF pros/oracles here that can tell the future, but check cutoffs yourself as well near the end. Overshoot cutoffs by a few k - better safe than sorry.  Lastly, prepare to feel overjoyed when you get to idolize your first event SR of best girl :)"

It has six, I think, plus any single-day or week-long bonuses between now and the event (and the few gained as part of the UMI Method).  But how many gems do you think it might take to tier with a starter account?     If you had to guess, how many love gems might a rank 50 (50 LP) or so account need to tier in that event?"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dpf0g,Crunchy-hime,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:21:43 2015 UTC,"hmm, honestly i'm not super sure but i would say at least 30! i think that's about the amount i used when i tiered for umi at around that rank! if you have a starter then you'll definitely be able to accumulate at least that much between now and the event."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dpf0g,Swagayama,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:19:24 2015 UTC,Spend loveca throughout the event and don't wait to save them until the very end. You'll end up kicking yourself in the head and regretting the decision. You'll start panicking about not finishing in time and end up performing worse on songs. Steadily spend them throughout the week and make goals/timers to make sure you spend LP accordingly to maximize your LP usage/leveling up.  Im assuming you're on EN so it might be a bit more difficult due to the popularity of Maki events. Be prepared to spend 15+ loveca on Maki and don't be stingy. Keep in mind you're basically only spending 15-20 loveca for an IDOLIZED SR. You'll most likely be making about half of it back anyways due to tiering rewards/points.  Tiering is an extremely time consuming investment so be prepared to lose some sleep as well to get ahead of the competition. Always set timers and check scores/predictions regularly and don't be afraid to ask questions on the event subreddit. Lots of people tend to give helpful advice! Best of luck to you! :D  Edit: Also don't be afraid to overshoot. I do usually by 1-2k points ahead of whats predicted since I would absolutely hate to have invested so much time/loveca only to fall short by a few hundred points. NEVER assume the predictions are 100% true don't be afraid to spend that extra loveca or two to ensure your spot in the rankings!

SchoolIdolFestival,3dpf0g,Iocomotion,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:54:40 2015 UTC,"Depending on how good you are at expert mode, wait for that to come out.  That'll get you the most exp gain and might save you some gems.  The 4x songs are better so you don't get sick of the song, but you'll also be missing out on exp, G, and club members.  I only played the 4x song for last minute grinding right before the event ends to save time when I tiered for the Eli event."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dpf0g,yuukisan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:45:34 2015 UTC,"I've only went for T2 once(and luckily succeeded), but my experience would be to make sure to look at the last score update or 30 minute before update even if it's at some ungodly time like 4 in the morning, especially during a bloodbath like what I'm assuming the next Maki would be. Other than that, like everyone said, make sure to keep in the cut off range that you would want to be in, even if it might be a little draining.  I know this isn't efficient but it's my experience. I get burnt out easily, and if it's token dear god that event song destroys my inside by the 100th time I play it. I actually chose to be slightly lenient on my lp and let it topped off a few times taking breaks, spend a few extra loveca than I would have if I had been on top of it the entire time, but it prevents me from getting absolutely sick of the game and quit it for a lengthy time after.   This is probably useful if you plan on tiering many events in succession."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dpf0g,Noctiee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:20:18 2015 UTC,"Each day, look at the tier cutoff's and before you sleep (if you sleep at all) make sure you are at least 1000-2000 points higher than the cutoff. I tend to find that over night, the cutoffs raise about 1000."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dpf0g,nanawatobi,0,Tue Jul 21 05:04:37 2015 UTC,Rushing for the card at the start of event. 4-5~ hours would put you in a spot close to or just above Tier 2 at the end of the event assuming you play using all lp afterwards.

ETA: you also shouldn't view the 'slump' as a bad thing! breaks over long periods of time will help you from getting too sick of it. if you've been playing the game for a long time and have experienced that feeling before, i find bouncing back from it is pretty easy. it's hard to escape idol hell. you should consider yourself lucky if you escape."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,jirachiex,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:55:18 2015 UTC,How much time do you spend each day playing to get to such a rank?
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,Penguin--Soldier,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:53:43 2015 UTC,"Like event rank? I was just pointing out that I got exactly enough points to get the SR, which I got by LP-managing all day for 2/3 of the event time.  Or if you mean user rank, I've played a lot since April, pretty much got the SR for each event, t2'd twice."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,jirachiex,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:19:38 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry I looked at the picture wrong and thought that was the general ranking, rather then the friends ranking!   And nice that you managed to get the event SR!"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,Penguin--Soldier,2,Sat Jul 18 10:06:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty normal: you can enjoy something, but having too much of it just...kills the fun. I wanted to tier during the Eli token event, but I had to stop playing because I've been playing LL non stop for months and by this point it felt more like a chore that I was imposing on myself. It felt great to come back to it after a small break though. :)"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,cellbun,2,Fri Jul 17 19:21:44 2015 UTC,"I seem to have a permanent-ish slump, which gets stronger after each event. I always try going for T2, on both EN and JP accounts.   As of now, I can easily clear technical mode songs without using neither sound nor healers, so there are no exciting challenges left for me (these don't include getting FC's, as my timing sense is quite awful).  I sincerely hope they will release that big update on JP soon, because at the current rate I'm steadily losing my motivation to continue."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,pawelte1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:22:32 2015 UTC,I pretty much don't play unless there's an event recently. I used to have the app running on the background of my phone just to skip the intro screen. Keeping the LP bar from getting full feels more like a chore now sadly.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,Ez_124,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:58:14 2015 UTC,I have this but I wish I didn't. My rank isn't that high so downtime would be perfect to help catch up.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,ExistingCleric0,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:00:47 2015 UTC,"I used to play all the time when I first got the game, but as I got more into events, I stopped playing so much in the downtime."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,xiukai18,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:15:02 2015 UTC,"I do the same. It's mostly because there's no ""point"" in playing. I have FC'd all of my current HARD songs, played all the daily songs, and I'm pretty sure I won't be able to FC the EX songs even if I try.  I mean, I do play when I'm full at LP and when I feel like playing buuuut... I don't check as often and don't go to sleep super late just because I had to burn all my LP before going to sleep."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,Yumacaroni,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:22:54 2015 UTC,I just stop playing in between events. So yes.

SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,AZUR3WRATH,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:41:32 2015 UTC,"Not really event slumps, but I only play the easy songs to gain more gold on my mains. During that time I like to actually do the stuff I've been neglecting due to the events"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,Swagayama,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:10:22 2015 UTC,"I don't tier, but I do try not to waste LP during events. For me, it's not so much a slump so much as it is a little breather so I don't get bored of the game. I do grind the daily easy/normal songs on my accounts for the friend points (plus the gold and the cards on JP) but if I sleep through the night and lose LP, I don't beat myself up over it."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,lygodium,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:33:59 2015 UTC,I used to get that feeling when I had nothing else to do than playing hard songs for the S ranks on play times. Now that I have the EX dailies (soldier game left...) I feel motivated to get the S combo...I swear I tilt/choke so hard after all the difficult parts and lose my combo count :(
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,Swanki24,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:39:15 2015 UTC,"I've been playing EN since release and I feel the same way. During downtimes I generally play only when I want to play, unless I have a goal in mind (like finally FCing Solge EX today). Now I'm just prepping my exp for level up before the Kotori event."

On EN, I just play the daily songs here and there; I just can't fathom the grind of 100/120/150 playthrough for those S rank lovecas."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,IllusionaryRose,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:03:37 2015 UTC,"I get that feeling. Sometimes I have LP but don't feel like playing, though I never let it sit full intentionally. Luckily there's almost always EX songs around."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,chibuki,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:10:01 2015 UTC,"Downtime is normal, you need time away to not burn out."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,himekochan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:20:48 2015 UTC,"Yup. I'm below rank 50 and basically NEET during the summer so I play anyway. Judging by the comments, this is very normal so don't feel bad~  There's also the times after score matches when I get so used to playing EX songs that I suck at anything below that (tapping too fast), hate myself because a b-side normal song should not take 5+ tries to FC, and end up changing the timing after a while."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,genoura,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:21:50 2015 UTC,"For me, I've been playing Love Live for about a year on EN server and about 7 months on JP server and I think I've hit this ""tired slump"".   I'm getting progressively tired keeping up with LP and events as rl takes precedence nowadays.   I don't even commit to tiering anymore; I just get the free SR and stop playing until the next event and do login bonuses. ):  The only reason I'm still playing this game is because I still love the Love Live series; otherwise I would probably have stopped playing a very long time ago."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,DarkLelouch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:40:34 2015 UTC,"I think it's more a combination of down time / event burnout than game slump for me .w. I normally spend the friend points I've collected to get the new N cards and any missing R cards, gem farming, collect skill ups for promo URs and try the new dailies/EX songs... and the occasional scouting frenzy -w-"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,harumegane,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:50:11 2015 UTC,"Don't worry. I always take this time as breather time. I only play the new EX songs, but other than that, I'm just waiting for the next event To come up"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,Arkardian,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:17:00 2015 UTC,"I pretty much take a complete break from playing in-between events (though I at least get my daily log-in bonuses).  I find it keeps me from getting burned out, especially if I tiered in one of the events."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,sschan123,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:48:22 2015 UTC,Yes I don't even wanna play. I only log in.....  Also tiering too much burns me out.

SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,Helen_wenwen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:09:59 2015 UTC,I have a little LLSIF burn out.. I did T2 for 3 or 4 EN Events in a row and the past events in both EN and JP I didn't even bother to get the SR..
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,Limoenchen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:58:08 2015 UTC,"i don't feel like playing at all either but i'm sure its just a downtime slump (though my teams are pretty much good enough so i probably won't go for event cards now, but then there's really nothing much to do left..) maybe i could start again properly when that assignment thing comes out."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dnkh2,honoumi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:07:11 2015 UTC,I only play during event downtimes if there are new EX songs for me to FC.

SchoolIdolFestival,3dp289,bathingsoap,6,Sat Jul 18 02:17:50 2015 UTC,I'm always trying to get the new Rares and Normals; so they never last. Its a good way to get the scouting itch off my back since I can't 10+1 just yet on EN or JP.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dp289,IllusionaryRose,2,Sat Jul 18 03:18:27 2015 UTC,I do the same for those exact reasons on EN.

I'd try restarting the thing (what device your running would be nice to add) and if that doesn't work, then let it cool down for a bit. When I play a lot at once on my phone, it sometimes goes nuts and doesn't allow me to hit anything in the game (like going through the rewards after a live show), but it's never done that within a show. Just try restarting and it should likely fix itself :)"

I honestly haven't seen a sticker set like this and I actually think a majority of the cards are extremely cute! Despite being an obsessed fan and being dragged down to Idol Hell, I haven't had a chance nor the money to fund myself to buy any Love Live! related items, although I'd really like to. Although I might not be a hardcore sticker collector, I like to keep them preserved until I actually need them. When I went to Vietnam last year, I bought some anime labels for my binders and to stick on my school-related items because I thought they were extremely cute. I ended up not using them because I thought they were too precious to actually use.    Why do I want this sticker set? It's simple, I want Love Live related things because I've never had the opportunity to buy anything related to Love Live! and it honestly kind of makes me sad. I love the franchise, the characters, their music, the game. I love all the characters of u's and although the SRs may not be my favorite SRs overall, they are stickers that I find really adorable and cute and I'd love to have a chance to have one someday!     I wish good luck to anyone entering this, and thank you the host for making this giveaway. It's rather unique I would say so thank you!"

I know a lot of people aren't a big fan of the art, but I actually love the style (I wish the same artist who drew them would come back and draw some of the newer cards). They have a certain charm to them that none of the new cards have, especially that Nico one~ And, that being said, the initial Nozomi and Nico idolized SRs are some of my favorite SR cards ever... and I'm totally not making it up just for this giveaway either lol. If you dug deep enough into my post history I'm pretty sure I've mentioned it before.  While I don't have the largest sticker collection ever, I do have a sizable amount that I keep sitting on my desk~ ;w; Actually! I just took a picture of it and uploaded it here! It um, has a lot of older stuff I was into but not so much anymore but I still keep anyway! And you can see the little Kotori face sticker that my friend got me... it's a fan-made sticker though so I'd absolutely love to have some official ones!  Also, regardless of who wins, you're pretty awesome for doing a giveaway like this... that requires like, actual effort and postage to mail out lol. Thank you~! ;0;"

SchoolIdolFestival,3dn4ec,sandykoon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:11:19 2015 UTC,Hi. I'm really glad I get a chance at this sticker set since I don't have any merchandise of Love Live unfortunately! I love hoarding/collecting stuff and I'd really like to expand my anime merch in any way possible. :l
SchoolIdolFestival,3dn4ec,Tatsukura,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:02:27 2015 UTC,I wonder if the sticker set is the same as compared to the ones Chara expo gave out.

SchoolIdolFestival,3do8sz,cubicrokey,15,Fri Jul 17 21:57:27 2015 UTC,"Having rerolled accounts, and having done about 13 10+1s across multiple accounts, the luck I got was approximately the same. It's a gambler's fallacy. You remember all the 10+1s where you got only 1 SR because you spent a lot of gems to get it, and it feels like there are a lot more of them than there really are. You remember the single SR or UR you pull from solo scouts, because you spent very little to get a good reward, and not the 10s of Rs you pulled as well. The odds are the same. Probability is a guide, not a hard-and-fast rule, and unless you have access to the inner workings of the RNG, as well as the formulae KLab uses to generate R vs SR vs UR, you can't make any solid claims about bad vs good luck except those based on your own experience. The odds of 90/9/1 are uniform across all users; you can't get a complete data set without gathering info from many thousands of rolls."
SchoolIdolFestival,3do8sz,lygodium,3,Fri Jul 17 22:22:38 2015 UTC,"There was this really beautiful post from someone talking about RNG who works in comp sci. I wish someone can get the link, but it pretty much explains all you need about RNG.  Summary though is that we can only speculate unless we have access to the code itself"
SchoolIdolFestival,3do8sz,TheSaltan,3,Fri Jul 17 22:43:38 2015 UTC,"That's what I was riffing off of. I'm also compsci, but I've done some RNG manipulation for FFXII on the PS2, which informed me a lot about RNGs and how random they are/aren't. The difference with the PS2, though, is that it's client side and there's only really one user. What we see as good and bad patches are just our mind trying to comprehend information by projecting patterns onto it. Besides, especially with solo roles, your view ends up skewed if you stop once you get a good card; you're cutting the data set short.  Regardless, here's a link to the comment in question."
SchoolIdolFestival,3do8sz,lygodium,3,Fri Jul 17 22:54:13 2015 UTC,"I have done probably just 6 solo yolos and never have I gotten above rare. My scouting ticket gave me an SR once though. I have done probably 8 10+1 and had gotten about 10 URs from it. It's all about the RNG. Some people just have better luck than others. What I notice is when I do the 10+1s on a NOT guranteed SR roll, so basically during the events, I do a lot better."
SchoolIdolFestival,3do8sz,KChinMaster,3,Fri Jul 17 22:14:08 2015 UTC,10 URs from 8 10+1s? Incredible.

SchoolIdolFestival,3do8sz,KChinMaster,2,Fri Jul 17 22:58:43 2015 UTC,"Have you done 8 10+1s total, or are those 8 just the ones that have given you URs?"
SchoolIdolFestival,3do8sz,lygodium,0,Fri Jul 17 23:03:45 2015 UTC,That's why I said probably. I don't remember the exact number. I was able to pull 2 initial Nozomi in one go along with the initial Umi. It could have been 9 or 10. I spent $100 on this game so far and that's mainly because I was given an Itunes Gift Card as a birthday gift and I didn't really have anything else to spend it on. That allowed me an extra 3-4 rolls since thats around 170 love gems

SchoolIdolFestival,3do8sz,Darkraiders,3,Fri Jul 17 23:48:44 2015 UTC,10+1 is still the best way to do it. Dont drink the koolaid
SchoolIdolFestival,3do8sz,TheSaltan,2,Fri Jul 17 22:38:31 2015 UTC,Well doing a 10+1 is doing 11 soloyolos for 5 loveca's less ans even if your luck is terrible you will get at least one Sr (in the corects periods of time)
SchoolIdolFestival,3do8sz,moichispa,2,Fri Jul 17 22:03:25 2015 UTC,Do modern pseudo RNGs really tend to generate favorable numbers close together? I thought that sequences generated by newer PRNGs were basically indistinguishable from a sequence of true random numbers.
SchoolIdolFestival,3do8sz,luciusftw,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:23:42 2015 UTC,"Probably not. In the same way an RNG generates batches of luck, it generates batches of unluck. For every 10+1 with 5 SRs and 3 URs, you have a few hundred with only Rs."
SchoolIdolFestival,3do8sz,Crunchy-hime,2,Sat Jul 18 02:56:46 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, but I'm inclined to say that has nothing to do with how close together those random numbers are generated... If the numbers are random enough to appear truly random, then it really doesn't matter."
SchoolIdolFestival,3do8sz,luciusftw,2,Sat Jul 18 03:03:00 2015 UTC,"Getting those 50 loveca takes a lot of work. I'm pretty sure everyone has had the horrid 1SR draws after all that hard grinding. So when someone solos a UR, they feel like the luckiest person alive.   I have the worst luck in 10+1s. I've tried it over and over, but out of the 40 or 50 10+1s I've done, perhaps only 2 or 3 got me a UR, which is way below the expected probability. I've always considered myself lucky with solo scouts, but after counting how many accounts have gotten good cards over my total, the probability only raised by a tiny bit.  I'm planning to reroll 1.5k accounts for China Dress Kotori, which will hopefully confirm my probability once and for all."
SchoolIdolFestival,3do8sz,keriiixxx,2,Sat Jul 18 00:17:24 2015 UTC,Wow 1.5k accounts? Good luck man.
SchoolIdolFestival,3do8sz,celestialskye,2,Sat Jul 18 09:37:01 2015 UTC,"I've done a 10+1 scout about 4 or 5 times now and all of those times I have gotten one SR per roll (I'm level 100 now). Just a couple days ago, I got my first UR on a soloyolo, and have gotten quite a few SRs by soloyoloing. Take that for what it's worth."
SchoolIdolFestival,3do8sz,paperairplaneclub,2,Sat Jul 18 04:11:18 2015 UTC,"I had to do a lot of research on PRNGs and CSPRNGs somewhat recently as I had to implement a gambling game for my internship. Proper modern PRNGs are easily accessible in every modern programming language and I doubt KLab is using a bad implementation (such as PHP's rand() function). Such PRNGs are evenly distributed; ie. getting a stream of numbers vs getting multiple single numbers will not yield less or more random numbers. The fact that people have gotten clusters of URs from 10+1s is a good sign that the PRNG is at the very least decent (contrary to the common intuition, a lack of clusters is a sign of a bad RNG).  If anything proper PRNGs are more random than something like dice where the weight distribution can slightly bias certain numbers.  Keep in mind we are talking about chances and randomness, it is entirely possible to get 10 streaks of UR solo yolos and getting 10R+1SR from every 10+1s you've ever done. 10+1 is simply more efficient from a draws/LP standpoint. Each draw has the same chance of being a UR/SR/R relative to each other (ignoring the guaranteed SR, which seems to be post-processing of 11R draws)."
SchoolIdolFestival,3do8sz,GrygrFlzr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:42:36 2015 UTC,"while i have gotten some good cards from solo rolls, i prefer 10+1's with the guaranteed SR just so i feel safer... also there's something about seeing all those envelopes flying out of the box with a 10+1 :P SO satisfying"

Yesterday i even scouted 2 URs in a row on the same account and made a post about it. i guess it just depends?"
SchoolIdolFestival,3do8sz,nicosbitch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:44:09 2015 UTC,"I've always been super unlucky in solos, 30+ draws and no sr or ur at all,,, 10+1 is better because you get a free card."
SchoolIdolFestival,3do8sz,Yumiiro,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:29:13 2015 UTC,"I tend to scout better with 10+1s on EN and I've just had horrible luck overall in JP. I really think getting at least 1 Sr is still better than a very minor chance of getting the UR/SR in 11 solo yolo scouts, which will ultimately cost you more gems.   With reroll accounts, it's a lot easier to see the advantages of solo yolo because your doing them from different accounts and certain amount of time. So while it may be nice to see two SR or UR/Sr fly out of the box, it's still harder to recreate that effect on one main account. Of course, it's all RNG based."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdz,UraKn0x,5,Fri Jul 17 01:03:22 2015 UTC,I honestly really like the app. The beatmaps are well made and they are a lot harder than SIF. The only concern I have is that they stole the idea from SIF and are making money from it (probably). If only we could make our own beatmaps in the actual SIF game...
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdz,samirsaidi,4,Fri Jul 17 02:37:36 2015 UTC,"Also, how have they not gotten a lawsuit yet? They're using copyrighted songs (and characters, probably.) and making money off of it. Unless it's licensed, shouldn't have this been taken down?"

SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdz,LucemVulpes,6,Fri Jul 17 03:12:48 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I quit this game so things may have changed but here's some major differences to note:   A bunch of the songs have only one hard-difficulty beatmap, despite multiple difficulties. Changing the difficulty just changes how fast the notes move. Perfect Locks work on everything, including misses. There's a nicovideo of someone doing nothing for pretty much the whole song and still passing it. Ignoring the point above, the beatmaps do have a higher skill ceiling. You're also expected to be able to reach one button past the center, for thumb players (think double note in positions 1,4). At level 50(?), you unlock endless mode. Each song is random (from a pool of similarly hard songs), and in random-mode (so you can't memorize beatmaps). Stamina and P-locks activate at most once per song, you don't recover stamina between songs, and the note speed increases every song. It gets pretty silly. I might've passed round 6 at most once. I found this mode the most fun, since P-lock isn't completely broken. At level 60(?), you unlock random mode. Basically you get to free-play any song in random mode instead of only the event song. Also, notes aren't forced to alternate sides, for the Kodoku na Hell lovers. LP recharges are always +75 and can go past your max. There's also cake you can eat up to 3 times a day for a recharge each. I remember having over 1000 stamina as a result.   There's also a bunch of less important differences like multiple idolization levels and event URs."

How can you not see the connection between mainland's society and government with their terrible behaviors? Their society has no sense of moral, they go around stealing people's stuff all day everyday, and this kind of shit attitude developed because of nearly 70 years of having one of the worst government of all time."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdz,booniecake,3,Fri Jul 17 03:21:00 2015 UTC,"Chinese who has lived in mainland many years, can attest to all this. China's really not as great as people over here make it out to be. If you like seeing public urination and utter lack of respect and curtsey, come to China."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdz,artonico,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:35:20 2015 UTC,"[utter lack of respect and curtsey]  really ? I am of Chinese descendant myself (born and live in Indonesian though), but the people in my family are incredibly respectful (maybe even overly so). And, in Japan across the sea, respect is no.1 priority o.0  About the dirtyness though, i can't comment on that :X"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdz,booniecake,3,Fri Jul 17 08:09:10 2015 UTC,Go to mainland China. I lived in Beijing so it was considered better than other smaller cities. When I visited my mom's home city I saw five instances of public urination in one day.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdz,junglehunter3,3,Fri Jul 17 08:18:57 2015 UTC,"Because you weren't raised in mainland China. Traditional Chinese culture prizes courtesy and respect in very much the same way Japanese do (Japan got a lot of influence from China). Then communist party came along and ruined everything, and we have the notorious mainland China today. Ironically, it is the overseas Chinese (such as you and I) who preserved most of authentic Chinese culture."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdz,Naikode,2,Fri Jul 17 08:36:11 2015 UTC,I am a Chinese descendant as well but I have courtesy and my family is not dirty(despite born and living in Singapore now so the cleanliness could be from the Umi laws-meaning laws in SG is strict as Umi-chan) I guess the Chinese in mainland China are brainwashed by whatever thing and it seems like Chinese not in mainland China are better and it is weird

I looked at the blog post you linked and wow, there's totally nothing original about the game at all. I don't even know why I'm surprised. Typical Chinese stuff... that I'm all too used to seeing =w=  Just one little mistake I'd like to point out, is the translation of the game's name. The correct translation is ""Moe Movement Song Princess."" Also funny to note that two of the characters in the title, moe and hime, are borrowed from the Japanese."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdz,ox6,5,Fri Jul 17 03:26:03 2015 UTC,"Basically, Japanese kanjis are Chinese characters, so there's no ""characters borrowed from Japanese"" here, it would if there were kanas in the title. And for the name, I assumed Google Translate would be OK with a 4-character long title... BTW, the final character is 姬 and not 姫, which means women according to the Chinese Dictionary."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdz,washiwashisuruyan,2,Fri Jul 17 10:10:00 2015 UTC,"I do know that since I'm from China myself and know a bit about the language as well as some Chinese otaku terminology :P I'm saying they were ""borrowed"" from the Japanese since, even though the characters 'moe' and 'hime' did exist in Chinese first (as 'meng' and 'ji'), they're considered obscure/old terminology and aren't used anymore in modern speech. The only reason you see them used in Chinese anymore is because the Chinese otaku brought them back from the Japanese, as those characters are still used over there. Hope that made sense, lol"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdz,hinakura,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:45:50 2015 UTC,"Well, not really. Some Chinese restaurants (at least the one in my city) still use them. Also Chinese. I've got no interest in the game bc I don't like the graphics lol"

I've been following Chinese otaku culture since 2007 or so; back then it was only used by Japan geeks but apparently others caught on to the usage and now use the word to describe anything cute, but that only started happening like 2-3 years back. I've definitely seen an ad for a Chinese restaurant a while back that described their food as being ""moe."" It's quite sickening >_>"

SchoolIdolFestival,3dmsi9,rinya,5,Fri Jul 17 15:20:57 2015 UTC,"You can actually play any songs as long as you know how to collect Bond Points accurately.  The list below is accumulative:   For every 10 combo, you get 1 Bond Point. For every 50 combo, you get 4 Bond Points. For every 100 combo, you get 5 Bond Points. For every 10 combo starting from combo 200 onwards, you get 1 Bond Points.   In short, for every 10 combos you have reached, you get: 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 10, 2*, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 10, and repeat from *.  For practical example, in a 101-max-combo song (where you get 23 Bond Points for Full Combo), if you get 50 combo, combo break, and then 50 combo again. You get a total of 18 Bond Points total (9 from first 50 combo you achieved, and 9 from last 50 combo). Also, if you never achieved 10 combo across whole song, you get 0 Bond Points at the end!"

I'm not sure if there's a song that exactly gives you 22(I know easy songs that give out 11), but using N's, a song usually gives me roughly somewhere around that or a little under or over.

My queues usually take like 5-8 mins to find a match so I try to play SIF during the queue but sometimes it would find a match really quick and I'd have to drop my combo just to accept or face the 10 minute penalty lol

SchoolIdolFestival,3dm89d,Winshley,2,Fri Jul 17 13:03:06 2015 UTC,"Taking from what /u/Winshley said and /u/Inuzuka28 said, you should probably report this to KLab or some sort so the issue would stop that they're calling you a hacker. I was questioning why anyone would be able to go through your profile and usually the community is pretty well-behaved for the most part. They would only point things out if they knew something was wrong.    Seems like your rank in ""Korekara no Someday [Easy]"" far exceeds the #1 place that was there for ""Korekara no Someday  [Easy]"" before, as well as people with idolized URs. It was probably just an error and if you message KLab and they fix it, it should stop."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dm89d,yokare,3,Fri Jul 17 15:21:20 2015 UTC,"I personally had different problem altogether.  I was playing ""Mogyutto ""Love"" de Sekkinchu!"" [Hard] during First Round SCORE MATCH event, and for some unknown reason my member spammed skill like... literally every milliseconds. At first I thought it was a plain graphical glitch, until I played up to the chorus and... to my surprise, I already racked up 7 millions of score.  Figured that I don't want the bugged score, I immediately force-closed the game. I'd rather lose 15 LP than having bugged score, especially since people might notice my score as it's a Score Match event."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dm89d,UmiLover,2,Fri Jul 17 15:34:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I've seen a video of the same thing happening with a whole team of the same idolized Kotoris. They kept score boosting the player and they already had millions of points.     Something like this isn't really unexpected, LLSIF was bound to have something wrong(other than dragging us all to Idol Hell). I never had this happen to me before so it was probably by chance that you and Meli-chan both had the same problem."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dm89d,ox6,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:42:51 2015 UTC,"by any chance, have you rebonded a certain member several times so it looks like one card has more bond than it's mean to on your profile?"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dm89d,yokare,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:24:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I got that Umi card 3 times and idolzed it and it has 750 bond on my profile"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dm89d,zoombirb,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:29:08 2015 UTC,Is it a rare? If it is so it is probably someone new confused by it... try checking the sender's profile if it is under rank 40 so it is probably a misunderstanding also people should keep their thoughts to their selfs coz that is rude
SchoolIdolFestival,3dm89d,yokare,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:49:02 2015 UTC,"750 bond, it's an SR"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dm89d,BiiSalvatore,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:53:11 2015 UTC,"that might be why? some people don't know you can bond a card several times, so maybe they think you cheated that bond level."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dm89d,Ruaichuu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:23:25 2015 UTC,"If that were the case, the people who bond every single card of their favorite N character would have a real tough time with people thinking they're cheaters. Plenty of people want good cards to show up in their bonds, so I doubt that's an issue here?"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dm89d,Inuzuka28,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:38:49 2015 UTC,"probably not, but its all I could really think of that would confuse someone into thinking OP is a cheater :s  I guess they're just a troll or really confused idk"

SchoolIdolFestival,3di2k6,imnoob92,5,Thu Jul 16 18:01:26 2015 UTC,"Factors that increase competition:   Swimsuit Kotori is such a gorgeous card when idolized, some may want to tier even if she's not their favourite. Unlike the last Kotori event ""Loving Words"", this one is during summer break, so people have more free time.   Factors that lessen competition:   Kotori is not the most popular girl on EN (though not the least either). Recent tier expansion. With the upcoming China Dress set and Vouchers, people may be inclined to save gems and become reluctant to blow an excess amount on this event (I mean, the set is beautiful, and China Dress Kotori is a very, very strong Pure UR).   Just a couple of things I feel like tossing out there.   Tier or No Tier? You decide! Good Luck!"

SchoolIdolFestival,3di2k6,Iocomotion,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:35:12 2015 UTC,"Probably not. I personally think it'll be somewhere around 32k. But ever since the time I made T2 with 20 points above the cutoff, I give myself some safety cushion."

SchoolIdolFestival,3di2k6,Misty_And_Maki-Chan,2,Thu Jul 16 18:00:06 2015 UTC,"Depending on your current loveca/level, it might possible to T2 both :P  With some rough calculations using my level 84 self as an example (assuming you can clear event EXs at least once and that this event isn't a bloodbath), I came to the conclusion that after taking into account loveca rewards from the event, I will either break even or spend up to 4 loveca to T2 this event (assume a loss of 4 so far).   Then skipping T2 for the Nico SM should earn 8 loveca from event rewards, putting the balance at +4 loveca.   If the Maki event is a bloodbath then it will probably result in a loss of 8 loveca after accounting for event rewards, returning the balance to -4 loveca.   Of course I can't guarantee event rankings will turn out like I predicted (although I leaned towards worst case scenarios), but unless you are truly broke (i.e less than 10-15 loveca to begin with) I think you can manage to T2 both :P"

SchoolIdolFestival,3di2k6,kohikari,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:05:20 2015 UTC,"Question: I just started my EN account a couple days ago. I got insanely lucky, I only rerolled ten accounts and I got the ""Cool Evening Breeze"" Kotori UR with my scouting ticket. Since then, I haven't spent a single Loveca.  The problem is, my teams are... not great. Blueberry Train is a green song iirc, and my green team is the Kotori UR (Cool Evening Breeze), Hanayo R (Total Charm), WS promo Nozomi SR (Timer Yell), Eli R (Perfect Yell), Hanayo R (Musical Yell), and four N idols. Obviously I'm set for stamina regen, but not much else...  I'm estimating to hit 50 Loveca the day before the event starts, which means the guaranteed SR should still be active. Would it be better to use my 10+1 in hopes of green cards to easier get the Kotori event card, or to use the loveca to grind the event itself in hopes of t2? I honestly don't care about idolized/unidolized as long as I have one, but if I spend loveca on the event it seems a waste not to go for the second SR. Is it even possible for me to tier with this weak of a team? (I could pull some more rares from normal scouting, but I'm not banking on it.)  I know about the blue voucher thing happening afterward, but right now my priority is getting at least one Kotori, since she'll have areally low pull rate after the event."

However, I don't think T2 is worth it for you. I'm not too sure but you may be able to pull an A rank on Hard if they're leveled? If not, then certainly an S rank on Normal.  Since your rank is so low, you'll be getting tons of friend points if you can FC Hard songs, which will probably end up being quite a few Rs."

SchoolIdolFestival,3di2k6,junglehunter3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:40:48 2015 UTC,"Considering it's Kotori, it's very, very unlikely you'll need 3 months worth of loveca for this event. Kotori's last token event was only 31k for T1. The cutoff for this event was 47k on JP, but Kotori is much more popular on JP than EN, so it's very unlikely it'll go up that far, especially considering blue vouchers will come out after the event and considering the event after this is Nico."

SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,AmazingAthena,29,Thu Jul 16 16:50:33 2015 UTC,"Actually it depends on the type of romanization used from what I remember there are at least three. Take Chiduko for example. On School Idol Tomodachi they have it romanized as Chizuko while the card has it romanized as Chiduko however another correct romanization is Chidzuko. I was taught the system of Japanese where らりるれろ are romanized as ra ri ru re ro. So at times I will put Eri over Eli simply because it's what I'm used to. It is not necessarily wrong, it's just a different way of romanizing her name."

SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,junglehunter3,3,Fri Jul 17 23:52:34 2015 UTC,How to solve this: just call her by her name: エリ、絵里、えり. No one will be wrong.
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,pastro99,3,Thu Jul 16 22:38:52 2015 UTC,"Let's just make this clear. There is a reason why it is romanised as 'Eli' instead of 'Eri'. Not because it is more correct, but because 'Eli' sounds more like the Western name ('Ellie'). I am very sure that they chose to do this on purpose.  In many cases, Japanese people who are part Western are often given a name that is both Japanese and Western, but will incorporate Kanji when written in Japanese, and use the Western spelling when romanised. For example: Noeru (Noel), Kento (Kent), Emi (Amy), etc. And Eli is one example too. The fact that they chose to use 'Eli' is merely due to the fact that it bears more resemblance to the Western name. In some cases, the 'R' and 'L' can be used for a more unique reason, for example Kagamine Rin and Len (represents Right and Left respectively)."

SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,NyanyeWest,11,Thu Jul 16 17:12:30 2015 UTC,"It's romanised as Eli though, so her name is Eli. Eli herself writes her signature as 'Eli'. So I don't get why people use Eri. Nobody uses Niko so it isn't even like they're being consistent if they claim it is because they want to use the ""Japanese"" names."
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,NomNomNeko,8,Thu Jul 16 17:16:39 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but her Solo Box also says Eli Ayase. So yeah."
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,EDNivek,3,Thu Jul 16 17:22:25 2015 UTC,I think it's a mental factor. In English 'r' has a distinctly different sound than 'l' so it's much harder to accept than the substitution for 'c' and 'k' which (assuming a hard 'c') have such a similar sound that they're interchangeable. Mortal Kombat made a franchise on this fact alone.
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,Atomflunder,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:45:36 2015 UTC,"The point here is though, Eli isn't romanised just for english, but for all languages not using the japanese signs, which includes e.g. spanish, italian, german, french, hungarian, swedish, portugese... (you get my point)  For most people and languages it sounds like an L so it's romanised Eli. It's a problem with how consonants and vowels are pronounced differently in different languages."
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,nxAkari,7,Fri Jul 17 08:30:05 2015 UTC,"Actually, in Japanese it would be 絵里 (Maki does call her エリ at times though). However, I'd like to point this out: in Japanese, it's 絵里 (or エリ if you insist). It's not Eli nor Eri; it's 絵里/エリ. You can't really say ""in Japanese they write it Eri""... because no, they don't. The proper romanization, however, is Eli, as shown in the link provided."
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,imnoob92,9,Thu Jul 16 17:16:36 2015 UTC,"Do you people realize that there exist, in fact, more than one romanization method, and that every one of them is as ""proper"" as any other? Just because the creators chose to romanize 絵里 as ""Eli"" doesn't make romanizing 絵里 as ""Eri"" wrong, it just makes it unofficial.  An exact romanization is one that, when phonetically rendered in kana, results in the kana representation of the original text unambigously.  A lossy/ambigous romanization is one that could be rendered in kana in more than one way, one of them being the original text represented in kana. Example: ""Kosaka"" is こさか but it could also stand for/be derived from こうさか (yes I know it's normally written in kanji, so before someone comments on it: this is irrelevant to my point).  An incorrect romanization is one that, when phonetically rendered in kana, does not correspond to how the original text sounds. Example: if you ""romanize"" 絵里 as ""Ari"", now that would be wrong.  Both Eli and Eri map to エリ/えり, it's not even ambigous, neither of them is wrong or any more correct than the other. It's just that the creators decided to go with one of them, and that doesn't mean that romanizing 絵里 in any other way is blasphemy because of it.  If you want to stick with the official romanization, then by all means, type ""Eli"". If you prefer ""Eri"", that's perfectly fine, too. If you insist on being ""correct and proper"", then you ought to write it in すごい日本語 and annoy all the poor people who are reasonable enough to not give a damn about all this pedantic bullshit.  </rant>"
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,-Ceris,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:43:52 2015 UTC,"Agree, but リ can only be typed out as ""ri"" but not ""li"" so the romanisation should be ""Eri"" but oh well  Odd thing: When I type ""co"" it does give ""こ"" and not other weird characters so Nico's name can be explained here."
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,NomNomNeko,8,Thu Jul 16 17:35:58 2015 UTC,"Ko and Co are the same thing, and リ, specifically the katakana, is representing foreign words, so it can be Eli or Eri because of the key word ""foreign."" the franchise chose it to be Eli and I think people should just stop fighting that fact.  Both sides of the argument are valid, but in the end, the creators decided it was Eli, so it is Eli and not Eri.  Edit: Fixed spelling and thought of an example of translation discrepancies.   The franchise itself is ラブライブ which can be Rabu Raibu or Love Live. The katakana to ラブ can mean either Rub or Love. The statement that リ is prounounced Ri is true. The statement that there isn't an L in Japanese is true. But what isn't true is that Katakana makes the romanaized word; it's the other way around. As I said, Katakana is specifically for foreign words, meaning they use their phonetically limited language to match other languages, and such Rub vs Love is created."
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,-Ceris,3,Thu Jul 16 17:44:34 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that /u/AmazingAthena's whole point was to show again that the franchise decided to go with the official Eli and not Eri, which means that everyone going against it, saying that its wrong, is basically saying that the creators of the official franchise would be wrong, even though there is very strong evidence that it is supposed to be with the l."
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,ILoveMySenpai,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:15:55 2015 UTC,"I wasn't saying anything against the OP, I was just stating what /u/nxAkari summarized quite nicely that there are multiple ways to romanize, and that both are valid... except that as the OP pointed out, the official is Eli and not Eri. My main point was pointing out the misconception of how Katakana worked more so than that it was Eli instead of Eri."
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,EDNivek,2,Thu Jul 16 22:32:50 2015 UTC,"As far as I know there is no L in the Japanese ""alphabet"" so you can't type  ra as la, ru as lu, ro as lo or re as le either. That's not quite my point though. ;)"
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,MazPA,3,Thu Jul 16 17:38:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, on my japanese keyboard, using ""li, la, le, lo, lu"" gives you ぃぁぇぉぅ. In other words, tiny cute versions of the vowels in japanese. The japanese r/l sound isn't a hard R or a soft L, it's kind of in between the two, so there is a little room for interpretation between Eri and Eli. But, the creators call her Eli, so I call her Eli. It just makes sense."
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,Cartyx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:51:35 2015 UTC,no technical 'l' but there are romanization patterns that are different and use 'l's instead of 'r's though they not widely used.
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,sakurayukihime,2,Thu Jul 16 17:49:00 2015 UTC,"The pronunciation of リ is much closer to ""li"" than ""ri"" though."
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,Misty_And_Maki-Chan,2,Thu Jul 16 22:19:32 2015 UTC,Now I use Eli (and Alisa at that) because it's the official spelling and I've always felt that it fit better with the whole Russian aspect of her.  But who frickin' cares? It's about as trivial as the stupid Aeris/Aerith debate that's still been going on since 2002.
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,Pibriamal,2,Thu Jul 16 19:44:48 2015 UTC,The moment I saw this I knew there was going to be a shitstorm. Nicely done ;w;
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,Yumiiro,2,Fri Jul 17 02:05:43 2015 UTC,"I don't see why this is important to be honest. It's really a personal thing. I use Eli, but I find Eri nicer. Does it actually matter? If it does, someone tell me, how?"
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,Atomflunder,7,Fri Jul 17 20:24:40 2015 UTC,"It's more of a personal thing that I use Eri > Eli.  Eli looks too much like Ellie, and her name isn't Ellie.  Also the pronunciation.  There is a difference with ER over EL.  The 'e' should be like AE, like in ""air"".  Eli makes it look more like the 'e' from ""bell"".  And you definitely don't want the hard 'ee' from ""Elijah"".  With Eri the pronunciation looks clear.  It's like ""Erica"" without the 'ca'.  Eri just looks cooler anyway.  Wooo must suck to have an opinion here."
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,UmiLover,2,Thu Jul 16 18:23:02 2015 UTC,....Eli sounds exactly the same as Ellie though.
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,makisodamnkawaii,2,Fri Jul 17 05:45:59 2015 UTC,"That depends entirely on what language you're using these in ^  In german, the E in ellie would be short (probably sounds like ally, but more with an e sound)"

SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,Pibriamal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:38:46 2015 UTC,"I originally used Eri, but have started using Eli more now, but I'm still fine with Eri and people who use Eri. I actually know a Japanese girl called Eri who romanises it to Eri. (Though I'm pretty sure the kanji is different.)  Either way, just because Eli is the official romanisation, doesn't mean people have to agree with it. I disagree with the official centres for some of the Love Live songs, such as Kotori for sweet&sweet holiday, Hanayo for Love marginal, Nico for Love novels, etc."
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,FoolishStrawberry,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:34:18 2015 UTC,"But Japanese ""r"" is a mix between ""l"" and ""r"". It can't really be properly romanized. So it's neither ""Eli"" or ""Eri"", it's ""エリ"", pronunciation wise. They used ""Eli"" as it's the closest sounding one and makes her sound more foreign. Write the romaji how you want it."
SchoolIdolFestival,3ditnu,Pibriamal,-1,Thu Jul 16 18:49:39 2015 UTC,"No, you can't write it the way you want.  The official way is the only way.  No opinions allowed.  do I have include /s now?"

SchoolIdolFestival,3dp4se,rinniex,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:11:38 2015 UTC,"Especially if say you start on a reroll that has a UR or maybe 2 to begin with, you can build a really nice account that way.

SchoolIdolFestival,3dp4se,juungi,5,Sat Jul 18 04:27:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly. You can get a pretty damn good account from just rerolling a lot and not paying a cent.  It kinda looks like they're trying to show off that they're a F2P that has a decent account (although not amazing by any means, fairly standard apart from the 2URs imo), and rubbing it in the faces of those who do pay to play."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dly3i,rinniex,4,Fri Jul 17 10:52:54 2015 UTC,"There is literally nothing you can do to stop people who are only part of the community to get accounts through giveaways; those who are smarter will blend in by posing as actual, contributing members of the community, those who aren't are likely to stumble upon a giveaway with less strict rules or a more lenient host anyway.  The only way for a giveaway host to prevent giving accounts to people who don't 'deserve' them is it check each user out and make that decision for themselves. There is no community guideline or rule that will ever stop people from attempting to get something for free with as little effort on their part as possible."

The truth of the matter is, I really love UR March Pana/Hanayo(as evident in my flair.) It would mean the world to me if anyone could give me her. I am fully aware a lot of people who want her participate in the community, I tend to lurk around because I'm too shy to post anything in fear that I may say something wrong. I know this is wrong in general for me to ask such a thing when I never participate at all, but I've always wanted this UR. I tried rerolling a lot. I followed advice and rerolled at least 300 accounts on EN but never got the Hanayo I wanted. I'm sorry again for being a lurker, I tried finding something on SIFTrades and asking my friend /u/irelinae to help me, but I soon gave up until I saw this thread that she recommended to me. I'm a new noob player, my EN account doesn't have any UR and I was satisfied with my SRs until I saw this UR. I want to try the Min maxing in hopes of getting another UR in the future and save up, but I assure you I will be playing this Hanayo when the time does come. If anyone can give me the Hanayo, I'd be more than happy and will gladly reroll for you as a thanks. I'm sorry for writing so much.    EDIT: I use Android! Sorry for not mentioning that."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdl,Murasakiichin,7,Fri Jul 17 01:03:16 2015 UTC,"...meh. Personally I think UR's are overrated. I mean, they are REALLY nice, but at a <1% chance at getting one it's a bit silly how sought after they are. I prefer Tiering. To me Tiering is really fun. Especially if you try and get right around the cut off. Playing at the last second and trying to squeak in is a truly exhilarating feeling. Right now I have about 150 love gems saved up dedicated purely to tiering. Maybe at some point I'll go for a 10+1. Actually I probably will. But when I do, I won't have any expectations.   I think that's the main problem. People come to this subreddit, see a million UR pulls, and get discouraged. But...it's legitimately <1%. It's not supposed to be easy at all. Don't worry about getting a UR too much. Just have fun with the game."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdl,Vivo999,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:13:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, all my yes. I like my SRs, the stories I have associated with my account, my high rank and FC'ing ability than some card with background art~"

SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdl,Vivo999,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:58:25 2015 UTC,"I find tiering so boring though. I think I'm going to try out a new strategy: SR rush day 1, play normally throughout, and then get in the desired tier the last day.  I've only T2'd once before. I'm planning on SM12 and SM13."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdl,Wiizel1337,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:01:36 2015 UTC,I don't think I could ever rush. It takes several hours of consecutive playing and I can't help but think about how many love gems I'm wasting in the process.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdl,Vivo999,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:07:07 2015 UTC,"I think after I saw all the comments, I will just continue with this account. Maybe it's really how just things goes. You're right, ever since I've found this subreddit I waa obsessed on getting a UR. I probably wouldnt visit this reddit much anymore lol. I just fucked up now because I wasted my lovecas to SOLOYOLO after being frustrated FML. By the way how do you save up that much lovecas(without buying)?"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdl,Vivo999,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:52:42 2015 UTC,"I just changed my goals. I decided I wanted to Tier so I could have stronger teams so I just decided to stop spending love gems on pulls. I knew I needed a good pull to Tier events so I saved up for a bit then started Tiering. (around the time of the last Maki event I researched all future events and planned out which cards I'd go for and which I skipped. The nice thing is I've actually earned extra love gems so I might be able to do a 10+1 pretty soon and still go for the tiers. In this case, the 10+1 draw is just a nice little bonus since my real goal is tiering.   Edit: Around Maki I believe I only had about 20-30 gems."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdl,tranceid,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:53:47 2015 UTC,"hi5 yeah for me it's not much of a big deal. My SPC (Smile Pure, Cool) team has all the u's member, and as long as I have all the SRs for all of them, thenn I'm happy with it ^ (as of now, I have two URs, and the rest are SRs, except for Smile Umi and Smile Hanayo T_T). However, if I get a UR in any of the 10+1's, then I'm happy with it ^ I also like looking at yt vids of people doing pulls, I find it amazing when people get URs in their pulls, sine it's <1% chance.  And just like you, if I get UR, then I'm happy..if I don't, at least SR wouldn't be too bad.  And yeah, I also do tiers...mostly high T2, or mid-T1 (Hi t1's when the T1 cutoff was 200). But woah, 150 Lovecas...wish I could have that ;; do you play the EN, or the JP version?  -yuri-^"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdl,Vivo999,2,Sun Jul 19 12:58:52 2015 UTC,"EN. I started around Feb and I've only done 2-3 10+1 draws I believe. Maybe a few Solo Yolos. My first pull I got a UR but the second I only got one SR and felt discouraged. I realized spending a few gems to get a guaranteed idolized SR was better then spending 50 and probably only getting 1. With that said, I probably have enough to do a draw now but have been waiting for the blue vouchers. In fact, I've had my heart gem bar at 9 stars for 3 months now. So after this next event I'll get to do some solo draws with my scouting tickets! Woot. I think most of my gems have been from some recent updates. I have a ton of more recent and R side stories I've unlocked, as well as the Eli summer giveaway and Nozomi's birthday. Can't forget those new songs that came out that would give you 4 gems if you S ranked AND FC'ed them. When you save love gems it's amazing how much you can accrue. When you feel you have to spend them immediately though, naturally your thirst to spend will intensify. I've been tiering for the last few events and have still been gaining love gems which is amazing to me. So glad I'm not in JP where that likely wouldn't be the case xD"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdl,tranceid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:37:19 2015 UTC,"Hahah yupyup I agree spending Lovecas on event with guaranteed idolised SR than 10+1. Yupyup, you better save up those lovecas for now, since from what I've heard from my friend, the blue vouchers might be coming to EN at the end of this month :) If only their birthdays are everyday, then we get 5 lovecas more often than normal. Next event soon, so all the best for that ^  -yuri-^"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdl,Vivo999,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:59:13 2015 UTC,Yupp. I'm planning on T2 the next two and then sitting out Maki but T2ing Honoka right after that. I think if I take a break with Maki I might be able to do another 10+1 afterwards.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdl,ashikiba,5,Mon Jul 20 03:30:35 2015 UTC,"Rerolling is purely a choice you have to make. There are people frustrated with the fact they have no UR and would be envious of others, so I entirely understand. The thing is, you don't have to reroll to get the card you want. /u/rinniex put up a megathread where you'd just have to request a card in hopes you get it. The best option if you wish, would be to start over with a UR or get into rerolling. Making a new account doesn't mean you have a likely chance to get a UR in any way, so even if you made a new account, you may not get a UR at all.     I suggest, if you're fed up with SIF, to 1) Reroll or 2) Join a giveaway or request in /u/rinniex 's thread. If you'd like to keep your account, you have the choice of downloading two different SIFs, one with your current account and the other with a UR starter. With the downside being that one of the SIFs may not be in a language you'll understand. However, JP is a great starting place because they always have the current releases as the game originated there and it's easier to reroll. If you get used to SIF, I think you can navigate. For now, you can use EN as a translator for JP or just go to this tutorial to see a full translation of everything right now on the JP version."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdl,juungi,2,Fri Jul 17 01:22:36 2015 UTC,"I've been playing since January and I'm rank 99 with no UR. I've also spent about double the amount you have. I'm definitely jealous of my friends who all joined the game far later than me and have 1UR or 2UR and that's ALL they talk about, it makes it really hard for me to discuss the game with them at all because all they care about is UR. However, I've been able to idolize two of my favourite SRs of my favourite girl, which makes me really happy! I've also collected all of the event cards since I joined, as well as promo Kotori and Nozomi which you won't be able to get if you restart...  I have another account I'm going to play separately, but honestly, I don't think it's worth it to restart. The fun is waiting and looking for that UR and playing events etc. I wouldn't give up your months and months of hard work and SR collecting just to start over! Hang in there!!"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdl,Naikode,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:27:57 2015 UTC,"I can sympathize a bit, I was rank 103, had spent about $65 on the game with only one UR in about 8 10+1s and tons of soloyolos and it was initial Umi - one of my least favorite girls and cards. Couldn't draw my best girl on that account even in SR form. It was miserable and I just felt chronically disappointed with the account. I spent a bunch of loveca and barely missed out on the T2 for the last Nozomi event before this one (back in January iirc).  So I would say what /u/irelinae suggested would be your best option here IF you want to reroll. Don't stick with your account if you feel miserable about not having a UR or not having cards or not having the girl you want. You can either reroll yourself, apply to giveaways, or to the master request thread - which is super awesome by the way.  Also, just to note - I didn't decide to reroll but I did apply to a giveaway and I am so much happier with this account that has a UR of my best girl. I don't go in to 10+1s desperately hoping for the unlikely anymore, because I'm already happy with my account. It could be the same case for you too. I'd say at least hold on to this one in case you change your mind, keep your transfer code!"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dkmdl,duahau99,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:24:06 2015 UTC,It depends whenther you wanted to throw away your old acc or not as I share the same feeling with you but I am organising a reroll project and you just need to request me which card do you want(The EN one is specially for you but the JP one is public)and I will reroll from October onwards to end of December next year

SchoolIdolFestival,3dhic5,muronashi,0,Fri Jul 17 06:11:23 2015 UTC,Well I don't really get much of a choice by now. I am a bit tempted to stop though if I get a few duplicates because getting 3 or more is inefficient

SchoolIdolFestival,3dhic5,KyofushiBibi39,4,Thu Jul 16 10:28:50 2015 UTC,Requoting my own comment from Megathread.   Our best bet would be after the next event.  KLab apparently removed all the support cards (#379~#390) from Album listing. You can compare that with this.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dhic5,Winshley,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:50:09 2015 UTC,What does that mean..
SchoolIdolFestival,3dhic5,Luminica,3,Thu Jul 16 14:05:14 2015 UTC,"I'm really disappointed! I wanted to scout for Nozomi, but since my bar is one away from filling I can't scout yet again until after this event... Oh well, more gems for me. I think people are being a little rude when they're like ""lmao why would you expect this"" its kinda cocky"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dhic5,ashikiba,2,Thu Jul 16 16:02:45 2015 UTC,"IKR. So disappointing. Ughhh, now I have to wait at least another event long.   I've been saving my loveca since forever. cmon."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dhic5,Sinyuri,2,Thu Jul 16 09:05:46 2015 UTC,I'm actually okay with this. After the next event I'll have 100 love gems and I prefer the Kotori UR over the Nozomi one anyway.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dhic5,MazPA,2,Thu Jul 16 09:53:33 2015 UTC,I honestly don't know why people expected them to be here this early tbh :///
SchoolIdolFestival,3dhic5,oreoxing,4,Thu Jul 16 09:03:53 2015 UTC,Because the voucher pictures are already in the game
SchoolIdolFestival,3dhic5,Makikawaii123,2,Thu Jul 16 09:05:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but everyone should know by now Klab doesn't release stuff until on or slightly after 1 year of the JP release...."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dhic5,oreoxing,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:06:47 2015 UTC,True
SchoolIdolFestival,3dhic5,Makikawaii123,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:08:40 2015 UTC,I think it's because they added the support cards into the card album awhile ago and they gave us the promo Eli UR earlier (JP held the login campaign from the 21st July to 31st August).

SchoolIdolFestival,3dhic5,Belethi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:07:34 2015 UTC,did you guys expect otherwise? surely something like vouchers would get a mention in the maintenance notes
SchoolIdolFestival,3dhic5,lm009,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:10:33 2015 UTC,I kind of expected this since KLab doesn't really have a reason to give them to us early. We'll just have to wait untill Kotori's event ends.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dhic5,Rutasu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:33:01 2015 UTC,I expected this but I really wanted to draw during those mermaid themed sets. ;__;
SchoolIdolFestival,3dhic5,Limoenchen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:37:14 2015 UTC,"Well that's not too surprising, considering how Klab usually does things a year later and there was no prior announcement of the upcoming features (which happened in JP iirc). Just because the assets are in the game, doesn't necessarily mean the feature will go live at the soonest possible time."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dhic5,sudonym_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:38:07 2015 UTC,"I wonder if no one spent any money or scouted they would've released them early....Oh well, a few more weeks won't kill me but it's sad that the files are in the game but not active.

SchoolIdolFestival,3ddc38,elsmirks,7,Wed Jul 15 14:21:06 2015 UTC,"So I'm actually a little miffed about the recent UR's, especially Nozomi and Umi's. Someone mentioned this before, but on the home screen they're TINY compared to even SR's or Normals, whereas before they'd be much closer or bigger.  Some say it's the art's perspective as in it's showing more, but they gladly zoomed in for the initial Kotori idolized UR and others that aren't coming to mind. They don't even have to zoom in, just make them bigger (I know they can, that can't be the full res of it.) Don't get me wrong, I adore the art for these, but when they're THAT tiny on the homescreen...? It feels a lot less special. Kind of wonky even when they're majorly covered by the speech bubbles."
SchoolIdolFestival,3ddc38,mochaqt,2,Wed Jul 15 13:01:22 2015 UTC,I agree! I really really love this Nozomi and want to reroll for her but I'd STILL feel unsatisfied because the art is so small on the home screen and it just feels... weird and cheap. : (
SchoolIdolFestival,3ddc38,ashikiba,2,Wed Jul 15 14:54:46 2015 UTC,I don't get that either! I think KLab should fix it :(
SchoolIdolFestival,3ddc38,YumiYumiYuu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:07:09 2015 UTC,YES TO THIS. When I saw saw her on my home screen I definitely felt like she wasn't placed as well as she should be. :( I wish they'd move her up at least. The floor board doesn't NEED to align with the bottom of the screen.

SchoolIdolFestival,3dhfm5,lighthous3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:21:21 2015 UTC,The best way to keep track is to go to the Event Megathread and go to the Countdown Clock! I find it really helpful because I keep forgetting when events end ahaha

SchoolIdolFestival,3dhejz,Vivo999,2,Thu Jul 16 08:25:58 2015 UTC,Don't wait to rush till the very end. Try being above the expected cut off well before the last moment. It'll be much less stressful and you won't miss out on tiering.

SchoolIdolFestival,3dfs6k,hoenoka,2,Wed Jul 15 22:45:41 2015 UTC,"I honestly think Nozomi will be pure, not smile. Rin has never had a cool event card; it is highly likely her event card will be cool. Ditto Umi and smile. That leaves Nozomi and pure (which will mean Nozomi would have 1 Smile, 3 Pure, and 2 Cool event cards - not having more than 3 of an attribute AND having one of each is consistent with what all the 6 other girls have had so far).  Why do you think the next event card is going to be a smile card? I was never good at predicting attributes.  The pairs for this round of URs are: Smile Nico/Pure Hanayo, Smile Rin/Cool Eli, Smile Honoka/Cool Maki. Whichever order they come in during the next 3 months is basically random and arbitrary - we can't predict it. Now that all of these six girls have had at least 2 months since their last UR, they're all fair game. Most likely is Eli/Rin, but that doesn't mean that will be the case.  Beyond a shadow of a doubt, we will be seeing a Smile UR every month for the next 3 months, though!"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dfs6k,lygodium,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:18:52 2015 UTC,"The last three events didn't feature a smile card, that's why I'd assume the next card would be a Smile. The last event was also a Pure, so I don't think Nozomi would be a pure SR, ALSO her last event was a Pure SR, the next closest thing would be a cool, which we have already seen for the Nico Medfes, but we haven't seen a cool Nozomi in a while either.   I also don't think for sure there would be a Smile Rin/Cool Eli next, but I believe there's a strong chance since the last Rin we saw was the Constellation Rin, correct me if I'm wrong. I'm pretty partial to Hanayo not coming anytime soon since her Promo UR will be up soon."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dfs6k,lygodium,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:01:17 2015 UTC,"The last Rin we saw was Valentine's Day II Rin in February 2015.  I mean, I would be shocked if they had three pure events in a row. But they can (and have) gone very long stretches without certain attributes - pure has won out with 3 and a half months between pure events (Score Match Round 11 to Ju'nai Lens token). Smile has had a gap of 3 months (Natsu, Owarinaide. token to Someday of my life token), as has cool (Score Match Round 13 to Score Match Round 15). It's been only 2 months since the last smile event, so there's really no guarantee which card attribute it will be - although we have never seen 3 of the same attribute in a row, so I doubt it will be pure.  Rin/Eli is almost certainly the most likely - both Rin and Eli have had the longest since their last URs were released - but in the past, KLab has released two URs of the same girl within two months (Fruit Bar Eli & Wedding Eli, Cafe Maid Rin & Constellation Rin). It probably just depends on what theme they're going for and which two girls fit the theme best for cards."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dfs6k,Yumacaroni,2,Thu Jul 16 01:14:43 2015 UTC,"I hope the next UR pair is Hanayo/Nico, fangirling over idol merch."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dfs6k,Yumacaroni,2,Thu Jul 16 03:21:44 2015 UTC,"I mean, they're the biggest idol fans in Mu's, the illustrators GOTTA do something around that. Hanayo/Nico in A-RISE costumes"

SchoolIdolFestival,3dfs6k,sakurayukihime,2,Thu Jul 16 17:39:26 2015 UTC,"For the URs: Don't rule out anyone before Kotori. Kotori was the first in this cycle. For all we know, it's very possible for the next UR to be a cool Maki. Also do not rule out Hanayo as promo URs do not mean anything. KLab doesn't care much about which girl spent the most time without a new SR/UR, and it is quite possible for Nozomi to be featured last between the three remaining girls (though I highly doubt she would for reasons that I will not go over again)"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dfs6k,wind_7,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:53:22 2015 UTC,"It gives me more of a perspective if I play by the stupid rule: but they had a UR very recently! But considering that Kotori had the Police UR with Eli while having the Magician Kotori UR two months later does shine some light on the fact that the rule I follow means nothing. I don't think I've heard of Promo URs being offered at the same time their UR was released in scouting, from my experience the UR Christmas Kotori was up when the UR Umi and Hanayo pair was released in EN, the UR Las Vegas Nozomi was up when UR Kotori and Hanayo Pair was released in EN and I think the UR Umi and Eli pair, and in JP it was available when UR Nico and Honoka and I think UR Kotori and Maki was released as well. However I think the Promo UR swimsuit Eli for the EN version was released when the UR Wedding Eli was available, so you might even be right!"

SchoolIdolFestival,3dfs6k,luciusftw,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:25:14 2015 UTC,I'm hoping it's Rin because I'm just too tired from tiering Eli. If there's a Nozomi I'll feel obligated to at least get her
SchoolIdolFestival,3dfs6k,Fiyachan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:07:02 2015 UTC,"Rin and Umi haven't been featured yet in this event cycle either. I guess Nozomi has the highest chance for the next MedFes but we can't really say for sure. Of course, if the next event is a Nozomi event, then I think that is pretty good for Storm in Lover's chances as the next token event, since they've never done three event songs of the same attribute in a row and Kururin Miracle is 100% a Smile song. Then a Cool Rin score match finishes off this cycle.  Also, the only thing we know about the URs is that the three pairings left are Smile Rin/Cool Eli, Pure Hanayo/Smile Nico, and Cool Maki/Smile Honoka. Klab doesn't seem to care too much about time between URs so any of those could happen next, tho I'd say Rin/Eli has the highest chance."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dfs6k,kotoritheforeigner,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:16:29 2015 UTC,"Those aren't available because some of the remaining girls wouldn't have any valid pairings. e.g. Hanayo/Eli would leave Rin and Nico with no one left, while Hanayo/Honoka would leave Maki and Nico with no one left."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,elsmirks,10,Wed Jul 15 06:35:12 2015 UTC,"It's official. This Eli event was a bloodbath. This score match event now holds the highest tier 2 cutoff (71600pts while the average of the previous score matches is around 62460) since Nico's Hinamatsuri (80000+ point cutoff record) event back when tier 2 only had 11500 people and tiering in JP was way different. It even surpassed the Sheep Kotori bloodbath (which I think had one of the best idolized SRs) by 1k pts. despite Japan's Kotori fetish as well as a 5k increase in cutoffs in tier 2. Is Eli getting popular? Probably due to the Angelic Angel PV. Was her idolized SR form very good? I think the Hinamatsuri Eli is still the best idolized event SR in the game and the Masquerade Eli isn't as good. I tiered 2 thinking I would spend less than 15 loveca. I ended up spending 25 just to be on the safe side of things and I have 100LP. Me getting a fever was timely since it gave me a legit excuse to file for sick leave and get through with this event. Sunk cost told to me keep on going and do it for her. How did you do?  Paging /u/BasakaNZ - do have/know where we can get a graph for the event? I'm interested particularly on how the event morphed into a shitstorm, especially in the ""Wonderful Rush"" stage. Thanks in advance!  PS: On the other hand, I'm hoping that the Swimsuit Kotori EN won't be as brutal as this event since I'm planning on tier 2 since the Seven Lucky Gods Eli is still very far away."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,checkthequeen,4,Wed Jul 15 07:48:27 2015 UTC,"Funny story: Compared to the previous Eli event I was busier this time around so I knew I would just barely get SR Nozomi. I used the Score Match calculator since it was almost the end of the event and I was at like 20k.   My first mistake was forgetting I lived in a timezone with a 12 hour difference from UTC. So back to the calculator, it told me that I only had 13 hours before the event ended and I panicked because I only had 50 LP, dangit, and that I had to use 3 lovecas in order to get her. So in the name of my love for Nozomi, I did it, I woke up early and used up my LP charge and then used 3 lovecas for recharge plus a level up.   Now, I checked reddit and saw this thread and then scrolled up to see that countdown clock link for the EN event still not strikethrough-ed and that's when I realized I was a complete idiot."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,cubicrokey,2,Wed Jul 15 09:50:54 2015 UTC,Is there interest to build a similar auto-predictor for JP like what I have done for EN? I will need access to previous events' hour-by-hour data though.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,luciusftw,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:53:02 2015 UTC,"One already exists, but it takes almost the entire event for it to be accurate because it never gets the early rush in score matches and medfes correct.  There's hour-by-hour data for the past 4 events here, but I'm assuming that's not enough."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,cubicrokey,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:42:47 2015 UTC,Actually it might be! The way my script works is to use previous data for the shape of the curve but independently edit the slope. Since JP events are almost always 10 days long I don't have to worry about different lengths.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,UmiMakiEli,2,Wed Jul 15 22:10:11 2015 UTC,"'Listen to my heart!!' is finally going to be appearing as a ""new"" EX in EN for the next batch of EX songs! I miss playing that song as it hasn't been appearing for quite some time in both versions already. ・v・  I remember how I felt when it was the first EX I was unable to FC within the period of time it was available for when it first appeared during the first cycle's Hanayo event as the very first event EX and I was forced to play Hard mode all the way for efficient point gain. =("
SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,Winshley,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:18:28 2015 UTC,It's almost a year since the EX song was last seen on B-Sides. That song made its very first appearance on EN at 29 August 2014. How the time passed...

I'm still at rank around, 2.7k though so I'm kind of doubting there's gonna be as huge a rush as the tracker predicted. Could honestly see T2 being as low as around 50k?   Ive never tried to tier a score match before, how bad are the last minute rushes usually?"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,artonico,2,Thu Jul 16 06:44:06 2015 UTC,at most about 1k per hour i think ? i never keep track of the last minute rushes..

Managed to full combo Wonder Zone ex in the very last match, so it was a nice way to go. I knew spending one more gem would be overshooting but I wanted to feel safe. On a minor note I had 212 gems when I started this event, now I have 201. Obviously I used more than 11, with the extra gems from the event and all, but it feels nice not having to leave the 200s.   It was a fun event and I can't wait to idolize Nozomi! Good luck to everyone and I hope you're into the ties you aimed for."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,christenlanger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:33:56 2015 UTC,Seems like I was right in just taking it slow this time and opting out of T2 in the Eli event. I did spend a few lovecas early in the week but the cutoff was too fast.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,wind_7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:32:59 2015 UTC,"I went wayyy over the cutoff, getting 77711 points. I spent almost every love gem I had too (which was 26 at the start)!

SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,Aerija,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:22:14 2015 UTC,"I began with 23 LC at the start of Eli's event and ended up with 8 @ rank 134. So 15 LC used, not including rewards. 26 LC total with rewards and log-in. That's not bad for an idolized score up SR."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,Kehki,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:58:04 2015 UTC,"How people are tiering with so little spending on loveca? Super low lvl or the polar opposite?  Im rank 87 atm, played almost 100% of the uptime and still had to spend like 15 gems to hit 54k..."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,art-san,2,Wed Jul 15 14:55:45 2015 UTC,Level tends not to matter much since less LP is balanced out by shorter levels. The worst levels to tier are actually the ones a bit after 100 since you only get 3 or 4 levels per event but don't have a very large LP bar yet (this will be even more true after pre-100 EXP is halved).  It's more likely that you are losing quite some points due to having weaker teams. This is especially true if there are songs which you cannot S rank yet.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,Iocomotion,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:04:59 2015 UTC,"Im coming into the Kotori event at the worst time, sigh... I'm at 102 atm and will probably be using more loveca, which isn't a problem since I'm almost at 200 but still."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,-Ceris,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:26:53 2015 UTC,"In my case, I'm rank 210 so I have 130 LP, so 5 songs per gem."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,Winshley,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:58:28 2015 UTC,"When I was low on Rank, I used 10+ Love Gems just to reach T2 as well.  Now I'm at Rank 191 with 120 max LP, which is enough for playing 5 EX songs with additional half an hour of waiting."

SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,Lynnelle701,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:54:41 2015 UTC,"Last night I had a little scare with Bluestacks suddenly giving me an ""app player has stopped running"" error. Thanks to this subreddit telling me of the importance of transfer codes, I was well prepared for the worst of the worst where'd I have to completely reinstall the game and retrieve my account via the transfer code I have for it. I was super close to getting the Nozomi SR on EN and I was especially not about to lose my precious idolized SR Rainbow Eli ;__; But thankfully the uninstall and reinstall process went exceptionally smoothly with Bluestacks remembering all my prior settings (I was beyond relieved when Rainbow Eli greeted me instead of a tutorial) and so I was able to get Nozomi around 3 am!"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,genoura,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:01:15 2015 UTC,"The Nozomi event is the first one I'm trying to T2 and I'm doing pretty well, but I'm still worried. I have 47886 points so far which would put me in 2329th place rn yet I'm around 5k points away from the cutoff prediction ;~;  My teams suck so even though I get a higher combo than people I'm matched with, I still manage to get 3rd/4th place most of the time. I'm also rank 47 which makes my LP refills expensive and I've run out of loveca. Really tempted to go to the store to buy an iTunes card but I still have to buy my friend a birthday gift and save up for these clothes I want ahhhh  Thankfully the cutoffs are getting lower so I hope I can make it by 4 AM EST/13 hours from now."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,Vivo999,2,Wed Jul 15 19:01:45 2015 UTC,13 hours is approximately 2000 points. Cutting it really close I'd say.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,genoura,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:17:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you for doing the math! I started doing specific calculations and with the resources I have (2 loveca I got from album rewards and max bonding), in 12.5 hours I can get 2448 points from waiting and spending my current amount of gems. This puts me at 50334- 2813 points away from the current prediction omfg  The calculator thing says I'll need at least 4 loveca to get to the cutoff prediction- 7 if I want to be safe. If I don't get to T2 now, I can always do it on KR since they're like a month behind. Next event I'm planning to T2 is the Maki one in August so I'll wait for then and make sure I am much better equipped lol"

SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,Inuzuka28,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:37:56 2015 UTC,Our best bet would be after the next event.  KLab apparently removed all the support cards (#379~#390) from Album listing. You can compare that with this.

SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,cubicrokey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:57:48 2015 UTC,"Now that I do the math I think it might be good for me to move onto tier 1.  From my current points in T2, it'd cost me 10 refills to get into T1.  I'd get a level up from the gem usage, so 9 gems - 7 refunded ones means a net loss of 2 for an SR skill level up."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dcr2s,TheBatSignal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:30:05 2015 UTC,7? Based on where you ended up you only have 4 more gems to gain. You won't get the 80k gem reward since T1 didn't hit there.

SchoolIdolFestival,3dc194,kotoritheforeigner,2,Wed Jul 15 02:30:12 2015 UTC,"Considering how unlucky I have been on 10+1s, I would say: if you think you would be really, really disappointed if you 10+1 and don't get the UR, it's better to tier in the event than it is to not and regret it later if you don't get the UR. Tiering is a guarantee. Just make sure you're well above projected cut offs and you don't miss out like I did during the first Nozomi event I tried to tier for. ;A; Otherwise you spent your loveca and you get nothing."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dc194,juungi,2,Wed Jul 15 04:53:40 2015 UTC,I'm doing both ;) I have enough for 3 10+1's and tier 1 (could even top 100 if I cared). I'm hoping I get the UR...
SchoolIdolFestival,3dc194,Iocomotion,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:04:03 2015 UTC,"I depends. You have to have patience to wait for the Kotori. But if you cant, you should probably go for T1 Kotori event."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dc194,RinHoshiChan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:35:45 2015 UTC,Tier - uses waaaaay less love gems than trying to scout for a specific UR - and it will also be really hard to get her again through normal scouting.
SchoolIdolFestival,3dc194,hopelessaddict408,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:42:26 2015 UTC,"It depends on how much loveca and how lucky you normally are. If you have enough to do a good 3+ 10+1s plus a little extra luck, you might be able to get Kotori UR. If you are unlucky or can't scout a handful, you might want to tier unless you won't have time to T1.   Also, another advantage to 10+1 is being able to pick up other Kotori cards. But it might be best to wait until the events start and kind of judge from there if you want. This way you know for sure how many loveca to spend spend  for x amount of points or just save them all for scouts."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dc194,IllusionaryRose,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:44:17 2015 UTC,I'M HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM RIGHT NOW
SchoolIdolFestival,3dc194,pietaro,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:44:33 2015 UTC,"It's a Kotori Token event, chances are you're not going to need to spend much loveca at all for the event (depending on your level).  I'm going to be going for both :P but good luck depending on what you decide to do!"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dc194,BiiSalvatore,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:58:12 2015 UTC,"Look at it this way - you can either GUARANTEE yourself the 3 copies of the SR (depending on how many loveca you are willing to spend) or you can risk doing a lot of 10+1 pulls and NEVER getting the specific UR you want.  imo I would always go for the thing you know you can obtain as opposed to something you have a very, very slim chance of getting."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dc194,rinniex,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:21:24 2015 UTC,"I'm waiting for the UR! Tiering, from what I've heard, costs a lot of time and effort (~_~;) I don't have time!"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dc194,YumiYumiYuu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:23:38 2015 UTC,The biggest difference is that you can't really waste LP so you have to play consistently. The additional plays from loveca only account for like... 1-2 hours max.

SchoolIdolFestival,3dc194,YumiYumiYuu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:32:18 2015 UTC,"i'm having the same dillema (/-) my plan is to t1 or at the very least, t2 the event. id rather guarantee myself multiple copies of the SR than spend my loveca and not get the UR. not to mention theres still the chance of getting the new kotori UR later on (although a lower chance than first release) so its possible to still save and try for her later."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dc194,rlomura,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:58:40 2015 UTC,"I would say you should consider which one of your teams needs more improvement, but since both of the cards are Pure attribute, it doesn't really matter. Doing a 10+1 scout doesn't guarantee the UR, whilst participating in the event and getting enough points to tier does. You can do ten 10+1 scouts, and still might not receive the UR! Or, you could spend less than 50 loveca (depending on your rank) and get an idolized Kotori and that cute little unidolized Kotori, too! While a UR will always be better than an SR, I'd say go for the T1 in the event, because at least the SR is guaranteed~"
SchoolIdolFestival,3dc194,Hinata_Hajime,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:25:49 2015 UTC,"I feel you haha! I believe it might be safer to tier, but it depends how much loveca you have! Maybe save half for tiering and half to try to get the UR? That's what I'm doing for Nozomi."
SchoolIdolFestival,3dc194,nozomi04,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:38:25 2015 UTC,Depending on how much loveca you have left I say try to go for T2 instead. I think I'm going to personally do a single 10+1 scout for the China Set and then spend the rest on tiering~

SchoolIdolFestival,3dc194,Tricksnyan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:31:25 2015 UTC,I'd tier since it's an event card since you can't really get her in scouting (low appearance rate anyways).

SchoolIdolFestival,3d9l3p,Finn_Finite,2,Tue Jul 14 16:32:04 2015 UTC,XD exactly what happened to me when I got my first UR!

SchoolIdolFestival,3dbi8l,OtomeLoveYou,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:54:24 2015 UTC,"There's a pretty helpful guide here somewhere - I'll add it in when I find it, but what you need to do is keep making GameEngineActivity.xml files and before you go back to SIF, rename the one you just made to GameEngineActivity1.xml (or whatever you want, numbering makes it easier to keep track!)   You can only have one file named GameEngineActivity at a time, so change name the current one to anything you want and rename the one you want to open back to GameEngineActivity.xml - (they are all different) and you can open it.  So basically, make hundreds of GameEngineActivity.xml files and number them to keep track, and if you want to open them, name one back to GameEngineActivity.xml because you can only have ONE FILE OF THAT NAME or else the game won't work - it will get confused or something idk.  If I'm being unclear (which I probably am this looks confusing even to me) simply ask me to elaborate!"

I was super close to my high school theatre department and we all felt like a tight knit family, much like how the relationships are in μ's. When we all graduated, I felt so sad about leaving them, which is something I saw reflected in Love Live! Each year the seniors picked a song to leave with the underclassmen as a form of ""goodbye"" and ""don't forget about us"" ... and it was THIS song. So when the song started I already started tearing up because this anime reminds me so much of my old theatre department and the friends and memories I made there, and mixed with this song? Endless tears."

Now lets get to the point.A similar problem was posted 20 days ago. https://www.reddit.com/r/SchoolIdolFestival/comments/3axnha/issues_i_should_buy_a_new_mobile/ You have to download the apps that /u/Secior posted on his/her comment.The comment is first so you should not have trouble finding it.The 2 apps you will download are TouchScreenBooster and  SetOrientation.After you download them , enter in TouchScreenBooster and select Super Optimized option(it should look like this http://imgur.com/3XSeomN ) .Those are the settings that I use but you can set the sensivity lower if you feel like.Keep the other 4 options as in image:0,0,99,5. Now come the tricky part.Enter Set Orientation app and select Landscape(reverse).Enter the game and now you should be able to hit the notes.I dont guarntee this will work for you but it worked for me so you should give it a try.The annoying part is that you have to do that everytime you want to play(only the part Set Orientation app).After you want to stop playing you just have to exit the game and then change the option from Landscape(reverse) to Disabled.As I said earlier ,this may be annoying,it pissed me that i had to do that everytime I wanted to play , but I got used with time.This is all , hope I was useful for you.I am waiting to see if that worked for you so please answer me back after you're ready.Really hope it will work for you too.Waiting for your answer."

I saw a meme of Nico and I just knew that she is god-tier waifu. Now everyone might have expected Nico to be a moe loli character, but when I watched her on the show I was shocked how ""different"" she is. She's not the textbook moe loli cute all the time character. She's very interesting and unique and we all love her equally. Except me. I love her 10% more than the so-called Nico's number one fan. I also like Nico because of her character backstory. Not only is she a very cute and charming idol, she's also a very cute and loving older sister.

SchoolIdolFestival,3d4t5o,Varianced,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:57:15 2015 UTC,Are you playing standard Bant? How do you manage that?
SchoolIdolFestival,3d4t5o,Locusts,2,Mon Jul 13 18:53:12 2015 UTC,"Bant heroic has been a build circulating around for awhile, it's had spikes here and there but it's never been tier 1."
SchoolIdolFestival,3d4t5o,Varianced,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:28:25 2015 UTC,"I never actually knew it. Probably because my LCS has players who frequent regionals and PTQs. I never actually gave bant much thought in Theros or Khans. Of course, now that I'm just playing casual, I might actually try to build bant. I like the combat tricks white offers, but I'd have to sacrifice the haste I get from the little bit of red in the deck. It's a hard choice."
SchoolIdolFestival,3d4t5o,Locusts,2,Tue Jul 14 02:50:26 2015 UTC,"Bant heroic is basically UW heroic splashing for dromoka's command, I've never seen mentor in the builds so maybe the OPs list is a bit spicier. There's also Ojutai Bant, if you're interested look up the list that Craig Wescoe played at Pro Tour Dragons of Tarkir, he placed decently with it."
SchoolIdolFestival,3d4t5o,Naginyan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:53:22 2015 UTC,"Right now, my deck is G/U, so it could go either way. It's a difficult choice for casual, because white gives me combat tricks and protection. But red gives my mana-ramp haste, which has resulted in some crazy turns. I'm not going to be playing much, if any, heroic though. Thing is, either color would be a splash: red for haste and maybe some burns, white for instances to protect my ramp."

When she's not doing that she's ok and I can enjoy her singing, like in Zurui Yo Magnetic Today."

SchoolIdolFestival,3d6tyl,neferpitoo,2,Tue Jul 14 04:02:40 2015 UTC,"I think that objectively speaking Maki, Umi, Eli and Honoka have the best voices and singning skills. Mimorin's range is just HUGE, Though my favourites are Maki and Nozomi, they have really unique voices (I may be a bit biased since I just love love love Kussun, but still, I like her style). In my opinion Nico sounds the worst most of the time, not BAD, but compared to the others, not really good either."

SchoolIdolFestival,3d6tyl,frostdragon1521,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:34:28 2015 UTC,"On a purely technical level, Eli and Umi probably have the best voices in μ's. Rin has a really great singing voice as well, along with Honoka - whose voice I think is severely underrated. But if I had to pick - Maki. Because I'm biased, and her Aishiteru Banzai solo piano mix is my favorite Love Live song. For least favorite, it's a tie between Kotori and Nozomi. With Kotori, I think I liked her voice at first but now I just can't stand how cutesy it is. With Nozomi - her voice is the most inconsistent of all the girls. It sounds terrible in just about any solo mix, but when the spotlight is on her, such as in lily white songs like Kimi no Kuse ni, her voice is bearable, and even likable."

Kotori, Hanayo, and Nozomi are the Unholy Trinity of earsplitting screeches. Listen to the first three seconds of this video. Hanayo's singing seems ok, but her voice seems to... slur or something when she sings. By all rights, Nozomi should have a better voice, but she doesn't.     Research for this post was done mostly by listening to various Aishteru Banzai solos on YouTube, and a few other songs."
SchoolIdolFestival,3d6tyl,Crunchy-hime,2,Tue Jul 14 06:21:14 2015 UTC,They really dropped the ball on Nozomi good lord. Kusuda Aina's natural singing voice is much better and suits Nozomi better anyway IMO

I think she's adorable, but as someone with singing experience (choir nerd, here), that technique of holding her voice in her nasal cavity is killing me. I don't know if that's the VA's real singing voice or if it's done to suit the character (I'd love for her voice to be different in reality, because it's just so unfortunate in her in-character singing). The thing that makes me think it's mostly done for character is that these girls must have extensive vocal training and coaches to help them out (especially since they perform live), and no coach in their right mind would encourage Kotori's VA to sing like that unless it were necessary. It's a relatively easy correction to get her voice less nasally and airy, so I'm just going to assume that's the reason..."

SchoolIdolFestival,3d6i9w,cubicrokey,5,Mon Jul 13 22:20:20 2015 UTC,"According to my theories and testing, team strength diminishes fairly quickly when maximizing for score matches (and even becomes detrimental past a point). I'll post my data when I get a chance soon.  edit: EN Score Match 10: Smile: 49451 Pure: 45321 Cool: 47754 Currently at 16.04 points / LP  Ideally, you want to be on the on the downward sloping end of the team strength curve. Currently on EN, I think this starts at around 45000 and begins to level out at around 48000. However, I believe that once you are in this area, then team strength becomes insignificant compared to how well you actually play. The reason for this is due to how team attributes affect the final score and how matchmaking itself actually works.  First of all, score scales linearly with team strength. Second, as tested here, you are matched against people who are within ±20% of your previous scores. Thus, if your average team strength was 48k, for example, you could expect to face people with an average team strength of anywhere from about 39k to 57k (a huge range!). From this, it's fairly obvious that you have an innate advantage due to more players having weaker teams on average than you. However, this is before taking into consideration how well you actually play. Let's say your FC rate is 50%. Failing to FC drops your score in a song by about 10% (depends on how often/when you messed up). Thus, you would lose half of the time to a person with a 9% weaker team (44k) who always FCs.  In conclusion, your FC rate ""boosts"" your team strength if it is higher than the average FC rate. While I have not been tracking the FC rate, it feels like somewhere around 50% which means you could effectively boost your team strength by about 10% if you FC'd all the time. This argument can be further extended to get all perfects since you can lose about 2.5% score depending on how many greats you get. For reference, I've dropped combo about 5 times this event and I average 10 greats per song.  tl;dr: get good to win at score match"

An increase in team strength means a decrease in the amount of people that can beat you. Where you start encountering problems though is when you hit the point where you stop meeting humans. I'd say this is really only a problem for the top 0.01% of players, and even then I would say that this is a problem that can easily be worked around.  As for numbers, I don't do pts/lp since I dont find it that useful. However, I do have numbers based on %s from previous score matches.

SchoolIdolFestival,3d3v7w,Danizomi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:38:33 2015 UTC,"For someone who is very new to the game, can someone explain to me what tier 1 and 2 is?  I'm just aiming for 25k for the SR.  Why should I keep going when all I see are lovegems/friendpoints/gold rewards?"
SchoolIdolFestival,3d3v7w,ArKaiNine,2,Tue Jul 14 01:46:13 2015 UTC,Tier 2 gets you a second copy of the SR so you can idolize it. Tier 1 gets you two extra copies so you can have both the idolized and unidolized.   I'd recommend you try to hit 35k since loveca are pretty important and 35k is close to T3 which gets you 3 loveca and a scouting ticket.
SchoolIdolFestival,3d3v7w,luciusftw,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:33:17 2015 UTC,"Currently the T2 cutoff is at ~54k. How likely is it that it'll jump up, and by around how much? Or does that cutoff already take into account the last day(s) rush? I'm thinking to at least shoot for 55k for the reward at that level, and idk if I should spend gem/s to hit any higher than that."
SchoolIdolFestival,3d3v7w,sunflowering,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:11:34 2015 UTC,"yes the predictions take into account the wonderfull rush.  at current #s (as of my post being T2: 37k), we can only get ~8k without gemming.  that 9k extra is the rush part."
SchoolIdolFestival,3d3v7w,Suicidal-Panda,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:23:58 2015 UTC,I'm thinking it's more likely it'll be slightly lower rather than higher - but I think getting 55k for the extra rewards isn't a bad idea.

SchoolIdolFestival,3d3q0k,Atomflunder,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:05:57 2015 UTC,"Mogyutto makes me want to smash my phone, does that count as strong feeling? Lol  On a serious note, I'm just like how you feel about Garasu no Hanazono, only with Storm in Lover. I hate EliUmi. I want to hate that song. Yet it's the song with the most replays in my playlist and it hurts my soul. I just can't stop listening to it.  Garasu no Hanazono, Someday of my life and Nawatobi always give me goosebumbs.  I'm emotionally attached to Aishiteru Banzai and Start; Dash for some reason, I put way more emotion in singing these songs than the rest.   I can relate to Kururin Miracle, not because I want to be more girly (lol) but the way Rin sings about changing herself and becoming what she truly wants to be is a very powerful message that describes my whole life.  Natsu, owaranaide and Arifureta kanashimi no hate remind me of my shitty love life.  In overall every song make me feel some kind of emotion, although these ones are the ones I can think of right away."

SchoolIdolFestival,3d3q0k,Callyvorous,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:14:21 2015 UTC,"Start Dash is one of those songs for me. Both the second-years version and the full Muse version are important to listen to together. It's such a motivating song, and you can feel how far Muse went between when the two versions. I can't help but feel proud of them when I listen to it. Nawatobi brings out a little emotion too, especially when Hanayo's voice does a little crack from crying."
SchoolIdolFestival,3d3q0k,neferpitoo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:28:44 2015 UTC,Aishteru Banzai always. It'll be one of my favorite songs ever!  Otherwise Eli's solo song Arifureta Kanashimi No Hate really gets me emotional (even though I grinded it like crazy for the event I'm still not tired of it)   Angelic Angel gets a special mention just because I love the way it sounds and I'm waaay too excited to watch the movie!

Voice actresses needs to have a versatile voice. PILE and Maki's voices are different, espeically when PILE sings in a live show. Its the same case as that."
SchoolIdolFestival,3d4x63,Ruaichuu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:43:57 2015 UTC,"Part of it is for that song they're split into ""boy/girl"" pairs (except Umi who is solo).  Even though Maki is the ""boy"" for their pair.  But the song itself is pretty low.  I wouldn't say Soramaru normally talks that low, but she is capable of a very low voice, right down there with Mimorin.  Nico also isn't her normal voice either."

I don't even know when the next time I can do it again. The FC is actually more impressive to me because I was using my best cool team. Normally I would play the song with my fraudulent PL team to increase my chance of FC.  Another song is Binetsu EX. Was never able to FC it when it was available in B side. Took me roughly over 100 attempts when I finally got the FC

The other 50% is either me being half asleep or forgetting to turn off the LP alarm before starting a song.

Some people may say Soldier Game or Nicopuri, even Beat in Angel, but rather than difficult, their patterns are really fast-paced and you can screw your combo if you're not used to them (but when you do, they're not that bad). On the other hand, Otomeshiki is fast-paced and the patterns are really weird to me, plus they're hard to get used to."

From what I've seen with friends and other Love Live communities, rapid-tap notes are what most seem to struggle with. I can survive it, but I won't get a C rank or combo. Beat in Angel and Soldier Game are easy with practice and memorization"
SchoolIdolFestival,3d475i,MrZeruel,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:02:35 2015 UTC,"Hi, In my opinion it depends, because yes Beat in Angel is the song with most notes to hit 598 if not mistaken, but the notes are placed in a way that I think makes it not too difficult to guess where they are. But for some songs like Loveless World EX Rnd The ending for me is very challanging. As for the last type such as Mermaid Festa Vol 2 EX the ladders are very hard for me.

Why not just use the scalable version on the main sub since you're sure it'll fit all screens? I'd just recommend pushing it a bit further up so the girls can be seen a bit more, but that's just me."
SchoolIdolFestival,3d28sk,AmazingAthena,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:13:31 2015 UTC,"I could possibly adjust some things again because I realized how bright the red can be so I'm thinking of lowering that transparency down, as well as making the logo a bit bigger and making the pixelated text, into an actual text below the logo of some sort. The thing about it is, my PC isn't the best when working on a wallpaper-sized canvas and it tends to lag whenever I gradient the bottom of the u's members, or when I just move them up or shift objects around. I'd like to hear your personal opinion, how much would you like to see the girls shifted up? I don't want to shift them up to much because I'd end up cutting part of their hair or head due to the bar on the subreddit."
SchoolIdolFestival,3d28sk,AmazingAthena,0,Sun Jul 12 23:20:18 2015 UTC,"I didn't actually mean for you to change it, I was more thinking about using CSS to push the image up. But if you're going to edit it anyway, then you might as well change that. I mean it's really only my personal opinion and I'm no professional graphic designer or anything, but 40px up would look a lot better imo. (edit: initially said 20px, but I was looking at how it looked on my screen rather than the actual picture. 40px is how it should be pushed up on the actual thing) It might cut their hair a bit, but I'd appreciate seeing more of the girls and less of the strings.    While I'm at it, again that's just me but I like expressing myself, may I ask why red? It looks a bit... off honestly, or maybe it's just because the original one is a lot bluer, but I think a blue filter would look better instead. Maybe turquoise or even green, or maybe even purple would work. But red looks kind of out of place.    I don't think the logo should be made bigger either. Having a scalable banner gives an emphasis on the girls, and I think we all know where we are. Agreed on the pixel text though -- I didn't like it pixelated in the first place (because it looks REALLY out of place compared to how graphical the banner is overall) so you'd probably be better off with something else.    I mean I'd probably have more to complain about, but I don't want to make this about me lol.    Also, the current one (still talking about the scalable one) appears to have been saved in jpg somewhere despite being uploaded in png. Not sure whose fault that was, but you might want to fix that as well."
SchoolIdolFestival,3d28sk,AmazingAthena,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:37:28 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, I can probably do that then and I'll see how it looks like. Do you mind giving me your screen resolution? I'd like to see how you see it and use it as a reference for myself. I wanted to edit it also because everything was just a demo for me, honestly. I wanted to see how it looked like for other people screens. I feel bad for /u/yaycupcake because they have to change every last bit of my mistakes I've made for the banner so I salute them for sticking with me ;;      I used red because I wanted to express something tropical(?) idunno what I did there, but it does look off. Initially, I used blue as the bottom base and red as the top. I will change it though seeing how the red looks out of place to me too. I don't want to use blue or green because it seems a bit too bright even with the darker shade, but I will consider a darker shade of purple to use because it seems like a better alternative to blue.    I just thought the logo seemed tiny for what the actual banner has to offer. I may edit the last one I did too if I can find it, but I'll most likely keep the original the way it is and focus more on a different textured banner for the scalable one.    I'd love to hear your opinion regardless! I really want to make this banner work in some way, I know it's flawed a ton (the circle text is definitely out of proportion in this one and I may remove it) to hear your opinion would really help me make this banner better.    I saved it in imgur as a PNG file. I didn't want the quality to go down using jpg."
SchoolIdolFestival,3d28sk,AmazingAthena,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:56:51 2015 UTC,"Just a note, to upload to reddit, it actually needs to be 500kb or smaller in file size so it needs to be compressed slightly when it's larger."
SchoolIdolFestival,3d28sk,Crunchy-hime,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:03:10 2015 UTC,"I'm on 1600x900, which isn't quite average (nor ultra-big, but I see everyone and some space on the main banner at least). The scalable looks alright to me though, but the logo might definitely look a bit too small on screens smaller than mine.    Well, if you're insisting on hearing what I think... well for starters the circle text definitely looks off. I also don't like it much on the main banner because the logo isn't quite centered within, but it seems to be quite worse on this one. It also goes up too much on Maki's face. The text is pretty unreadable on smaller screens as well, so removing it would probably be your best option. There could probably be some workaround, but it's not my work so I can't tell how to work with it in an improved way. Anyway, well, for the rest, I already gave my opinion on the colors (if you want to go for something tropical, I'd advise more of a warm orange or yellow, but it doesn't fit at all for mermaids to be honest), another thing that bothers me is that the girls don't have an equal living space. Umi is completely squished between Maki and Hanayo (not to mention awkwardly placed hands, though I can't see them on my screen) while Kotori gets as much space as taken by the first three. Rin looks a bit squished too. Since you're working on a fixed sized canvas that you have to entirely fill without worry, you should have the occasion to spread them apart a bit more and you can take advantage of this to make sure no one looks squished in the back. And there's only one other thing I'll complain about, it's the effects. To be honest (once again, this is just me, and I'm pretty sure your banner won because of the effects in the first place), there are too many to my taste. What's with those lines on Rin/Nico and Nozomi? Doesn't that look off to you? Because it sure does to me. I like the lines on the main banner, on the logo, but having random lines on only a few renders on this one is just... weird. It just doesn't work. It looks like you don't like those girls in particular but since you couldn't just cut them out you put some stuff on their face. Well, and along with that goes the light thing you've got going on there. It looks nice and it's not a bad addition, but those little bits on light in Hanayo's mouth and hers, Umi's and Rin's eyes make me kind of think that you're just putting random nice-looking things around without really paying attention to where it goes, whereas detail and precision is in my opinion the most important thing when working on graphical design.    But once again, this is just me. Surely most people on the sub aren't bothered that much if at all by the things that bother me, as I tend to be a bit of a perfectionist. If the people of the sub like it the way it is now, then you shouldn't care that much about how I think. Sadly unlike my username states, I'm nothing but a mere human -- I wouldn't give my opinion higher value over anyone else's."
SchoolIdolFestival,3d28sk,RinIsNya,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:44:52 2015 UTC,"I'm on the same monitor size as you, so I guess I don't really need a reference then.    Thank you for the input! I wanted to remove the circle text but I lagged too much that I had no choice but to keep it in there and try my best to position it. My initial banner was finished but my laptop overheated and all progress was lost. I kind of got extremely lazy on this one and wanted to finish it ASAP. I can definitely say those lines near the middle and the end of Nozomi look off and I'll remove those in my next attempt. It's not that I don't like them, they're all my favorite girls and if I had to pick my least favorite I'd probably say Maki. (sorry for all the Maki fans out there) It was a hard decision whether or not I should remove some of the lights. Umi looks like she's crying and Hanayo looks like she's having another pupil that's glowing. As for the lighting, I'll definitely use a different color because red, nor any of the tropical colors seem fitting for the Mermaid set. (not sure why I put it there though) I'd probably say that I'll definitely decrease the amounts of bokeh that's in Nico's hair and all over the place because I wanted to from the beginning but forgot when I flattened the layers out and my laptop was beginning to overheat due to all the stress I've put it through. I'll also remove the purple text on the logo for the scalable version.     As for their positioning, I agree. I wasn't being too careful on that and I ended up freaking out because I thought there was no space when I'd finish it and I'll have to start all over again. The thing about the program I use is that once you deselect a layer, if there's a corner, it'll cut the excess corners out and if I move it there's just a transparent space.    Another thing that definitely ticks me off, and I'm not sure you noticed it, but the size difference between Kotori and Nozomi look totally off from the rest. I had a difficult time finding the right size to make them look like they're equal with the rest of the members.    I appreciate your opinion lots! I want to improve on this banner and with some trial and error, I hope to fix some of the mistakes I've made during this. You're absolutely right that graphic design has to be done with precision. I'm not used to large canvases and it's really hard for me working with wallpaper sizes because smaller sizes fit my style better. (also because I have a crappy PC and it always lags so it's hard to work on something) I think having a second person's view of things really helps and thank you so much for taking your time writing that. I asked for a critique from another person before on the banner, but they didn't reply to me at all so your input is very helpful to me!"
SchoolIdolFestival,3d28sk,BiiSalvatore,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:19:16 2015 UTC,"It's not really a sub-subreddit or anything, it's actually using the language settings. It's the exact same system as the filters for luck and achievement posts. Many subreddits use this to do style switchers, filters, and other things of the sort.  The reason I decided to implement this instead of changing the default, is because some people might prefer the way it is now. This was everyone can have an option."

It's just when I'm on my iPod, it runs over and always covers the top post, in both portrait and landscape, meaning it's impossible to click on unless I go on mobile reddit (which is a bit naff imo)."

SchoolIdolFestival,3d28sk,Music-Piano,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:07:05 2015 UTC,"It's because that's technically part of the sidebar (just styled to appear outside it). We are at the character limit for the sidebar right now, reddit simply doesn't allow more to be typed. As mentioned before, we are in the process of revamping some things to make more room, but once that's done, the style switching will be put in a more visible location.  Edit: whoops I thought this was a reply about the style switcher, just came from my inbox. ;  Anyway I've played around with that table before and it gave sone weird results. I can look into it again when I get a chance but it's not the highest priority thing at the moment."

I have been waiting for mine for two months, and the funny thing is that I provided them with everything they needed the day I lost my account. I told them everything. @_@"
SchoolIdolFestival,3d2rvg,Crunchy-hime,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:43:03 2015 UTC,"On EN?  Huh. Maybe it was a busy time of year?  I mean, I think info shouldn't change much. The only reason it would change things would be so thy can make sure no key logs in to the account you are trying to recover if you don't provide enough...  I recommend sending another email (in response to one about your initial email)."

SchoolIdolFestival,3d2rvg,MickeySeraphin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:19:46 2015 UTC,It took me approx. 2 weeks! I didn't reply right away to some emails so it shouldn't take you more than a month unless you don't have a lot of information. Depending on how much information you have on your account will make it much easier/faster.

The second one I lost (two days after losing my first), I still haven't gotten back. About 4-5 weeks into my wait, I got an email from KLab asking for more details for it. I provided them, and it's been about 3 weeks since then. I wouldn't be particularly upset if I never got it back, but I'd like to give it away if I did."
SchoolIdolFestival,3d2rvg,Ange-the-Cross,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:32:36 2015 UTC,Took 4 weeks to a month for me. Would have taken just 2 weeks but they rejected my first request for retrieval of a lost account because apparently getting the daily rewards counts as logging in so the account can't be considered lost. i had to stop getting the rewards and sent another email which took another 2 weeks before they replied. At least i did get it back in the end though. I was around rank 100 and had a UR so it would have been quite painful to lose it
SchoolIdolFestival,3d2rvg,StarlightGoddess,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:42:04 2015 UTC,"It took me about 4 weeks? They asked for information once, then a fortnight later I asked for an update which they said is still in the queue. Days later then they asked for a second verification, so I waited another fortnight to which they finally recovered mine. It helps to send a thank you note though. This is on a Jp account.    I'm guessing the queue gets larger after an update, that's why some people have variable recovery times."

SchoolIdolFestival,3d3jh2,RinHoshiChan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:21:53 2015 UTC,"Like someone above me said, sometimes you should wait a little or DC wifi and connect it again before tapping restart as there are times when the screens will continue changing even with the message there, and since it doesn't cover the ""ok"" button and you can tap anywhere to skip, you can continue with the rest until you go back to the home screen and restart. It has saved me a couple of times!"

SchoolIdolFestival,3d30dd,DoctorCarty,2,Mon Jul 13 02:59:27 2015 UTC,"To tell if an idol is idolized, they'll have an even number of stars on the card. They also have different outfits. When you sort by rarity, they'll either be 2, 4, 6, or 8. (Idolized Normal, Rare, Super Rare, and Ultra Rare, in that order.) You can idolize an idol multiple times, but can only receive their love gem from the side story ONCE. And when you max level them, it will only count the first time. But you can keep idolizing them if you get them, and add more bond to it. That's why people have very high bonds for certain idols on their profiles. They keeping idolizing or max bonding them :) You can idolize a SR and an UR! But they have to be the exact same copy of the card. Meaning, for example, an Eli R with another copy of that same Eli R. When you do a special practice, it should show you which card is available to do the special practice with. If it is already idolized, you won't be able to special practice it with an unidolized version. Basically you can only idolize them multiple times if you have enough copies of them. And for SRs and URs, you'll need 2 copies of each. Hope this helped you and good luck! :)"

Only to get too many dokis at the last minute and finished the song with 3 goods.  Best part: It was during a Score match so the highest combo that I've ever achieved on this stu-dumb song was not recorded and I didn't get my Love gem.  I have so much hate for this song.

My poor phone case has many scratches and cracks due to how any times I dropped it.

Not only did I die and waste my lp, an entire section of my phone screen was split in two. Thankfully I did get it fixed, but I've learned to never play SIF with my phone case."

SchoolIdolFestival,3d04ey,wonderful-rush,3,Sun Jul 12 10:37:28 2015 UTC,"It's pretty difficult to predict which girl is going to be featured in each one of the remaining events of this round.  I believe Rin's not going to have the Token Event because what /u/sirenix said (her last events were two token events), but also because I believe Kururin MIRACLE is going to be a Smile song and the previous two Token Events had Smile songs too (Trouble Busters and Shiawase iki no SMILING!). And with Umi and Nozomi left, with both of them having a Score Match during the last round, makes Rin the most likely to have a Score Match.  Also, to everyone who thinks that Nozomi is going to be the next girl because she hasn't had an event since the second half of February (like 4 months and a half counting the currently Score Match), I have to say that it really doesn't matter. Look at Eli's first Score Match (second half of October) and then her next event, the SID that we had in the EN server during the second half of June. 8 months. Then, we are sure that the next UR on JP will be Nozomi, so this makes me think that she has less chances to be chosen in the MedFes.  In the end, I think that the next events are going to be one of the following two possibilities. The first one is this, and I think it's the most likely to be true:   Umi's Medley Festival. Her attribute is most likely to be Smile as she hasn't had one never before, and we don't have a Smile event card since Detective Hanayo. Nozomi's Token Event. Maybe Cool because Moshimo Kara Kitto sounds like a Pure song to me, and we have seen KLab releasing cards that don't match the attribute of the featured songs since Baseball Rin-Futari Happiness. Rin's Score Match, with the remaining Pure card of this round.   And the another one is this:   Nozomi's Medley Festival, with Pure as her attribute. Umi's Token Event, with Smile attribute and Storm in Lover (Cool). Rin's Score Match, with Cool as her attribute.   Maybe we're all wrong and Rin's the girl chosen for the next MedFes because KLab wants (and likes) to troll us, but well. We'll see who is right next week!"

SchoolIdolFestival,3d04ey,Rutasu,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:46:34 2015 UTC,"Nozomi's last event was a Score Match and the card was Pure, so I highly doubt it."
SchoolIdolFestival,3d04ey,nicedog98,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:06:15 2015 UTC,"I still think that Nozomi is a Pure card this round since Umi is Smile and Rin is Cool because they never had those attributes in events before. It's not the first time that someone got the same attribute twice in a row. Look at Rin for example, she got 3 smile events in a row.  You could be right about the score match part though but we'll see~"
SchoolIdolFestival,3d04ey,shiinamachi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:11:37 2015 UTC,"Hmm, good point. I never considered that.   However, I still hope (and believe) it will be a Nozomi event, because if she gets a Pure Score Match after Umi and Rin, then about 8 months will have passed since she got her last event, and that's pretty crazy. That and I have been struggling to not scout my 120 loveca away ever since the Nico Medley, I'm in genuine pain   But, as you said, we'll see~"

SchoolIdolFestival,3d04ey,luciusftw,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:24:26 2015 UTC,"It's kind of hard to tell, especially since all three remaining girls could have a token event with their BD songs (Storm in Lover, Moshimo Kara Kitto and Kururin Miracle). What makes it even harder to tell is that none of the three girls have had a Medley Festival before. Umi and Nozomi's events in the last rounds were both Score Matches, which makes it unlikely that they would get one again this round. Rin's last TWO events have been token matches, so I strongly doubt she would get a third one this soon. So that probably rules out Kururin Miracle as the next event song.   So basically what I'm saying is, Rin is most likely the next Score Match event, Nozomi and Umi are valid candidates for either Token or Medley events. Of course KLab could still go ahead and give either of them another score match, or even give Rin her third token event in a row, but whatever."

Thankfully it doesn't usually break my combo but it always manages to throw me for a loop. I only recently graduated to Expert songs - my favorites are probably Korekara no Someday and No Brand Girls, though Ai wa is fun too and it's a pretty reliable FC. For hard songs - ones like Kodoku no Heaven and Pure Girls Project are fun for their patterns. And obviously it's always great to play songs that I genuinely enjoy as songs, such as Donna Toki mo Zutto and Kimi no Kuse ni. Yeah, this is more than you wanted, sorry, but as you can see it's really hard for me to single out favorites."

SchoolIdolFestival,3cyifr,ColoredPencil,2,Sun Jul 12 07:10:43 2015 UTC,It seems that I always play better with the sound off...  But I always turn it on anyway cause it's juste more fun to play and sing along with the song.

SchoolIdolFestival,3cyifr,ein_caligo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:50:21 2015 UTC,I always go for Sound ON. But OFF does help me esp. when I'm going to SSS songs on Hard.  I mean you don't really want to hear the same song for a hundred consecutive times. Unless it's your favorite.

SchoolIdolFestival,3cyifr,wildsneezin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:34:37 2015 UTC,I mostly play with the sound off. The only time I play it with sound is if I feel like listening to it. It doesn't affect my playing if the sound is on or off. :3

SchoolIdolFestival,3cyifr,hopelessaddict408,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:25:15 2015 UTC,"I can't play with the music off - I rely on the beat to hit the notes, by keeping the beat in my head and synchronizing the ""tambourine"" tap sound with the beat. It's also the reason keeping me from FC's on certain EX songs. If I feel a note should be a bit earlier/later/more notes/less notes (note spams) I'll instinctively tap, eheh.."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cyifr,GoiRodeGoi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:53:28 2015 UTC,No. I actually tried to play an EX song with the sound off today and broke my combo three times.
SchoolIdolFestival,3cyifr,bananachoo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:40:10 2015 UTC,I actually used to play LL with no sound for a month or two. I didn't notice a huge difference in gameplay except maybe not being able to FC as efficiently.  And I hate to say it but Ai wa Taiyou Ja Nai is one of my absolute favorite solo songs but...that tambourine....please.......
SchoolIdolFestival,3cyifr,FoolishStrawberry,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:14:35 2015 UTC,You can turn the tambourine sound off in the settings. Just go on settings>general>sound effects and slide it completely towards the minus sign.
SchoolIdolFestival,3cyifr,bananachoo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:18:52 2015 UTC,Oh I like the sound when the notes hit I mean the tambourine in the actual song ;w;

SchoolIdolFestival,3cxyga,ILoveMySenpai,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:07:22 2015 UTC,I wouldn't scout from the Bibi box because the chances of getting that particular card are abysmal (like a 1/18 chance even if you get a UR). I'd wait for the pickup box containing that card (it will also contain Valentine's Rin) so you can at least have a decent shot at it. :)
SchoolIdolFestival,3cxyga,luciusftw,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:18:00 2015 UTC,Ah! Thank you for the tip! n___n
SchoolIdolFestival,3cxyga,Yumacaroni,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:24:33 2015 UTC,"Considering how JP goes with guaranteed SR pulls... (really, pretty much when one ends another begins), I'd say wait until something that catches your attention more. You won't have to wait much, I don't think."

SchoolIdolFestival,3cxyga,Tricksnyan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:20:25 2015 UTC,"LOL NOPE. Because Rin is my love and best idol, I have 179 loveca and 14 scouting tickets for her saved up on JP when her UR comes out so I don't know why you're freaking out."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cxyga,Tricksnyan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:01:53 2015 UTC,"h OLY... nice.  Also I literally just read a thread about the next set of URs and it seems Rin might be one of them. I hope it's for certain, but at least now i'll be more tempted to keep saving."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cxyga,luciusftw,0,Sat Jul 11 20:09:16 2015 UTC,I thought the next UR was Nozomi; her being paired up with Umi and it made sense due to the skill name or somethin'.
SchoolIdolFestival,3cxyga,Tricksnyan,2,Sat Jul 11 20:13:43 2015 UTC,"Rin/Eli would make sense as the next set, since they have the highest collective amount of time between their last URs."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cxyga,luciusftw,0,Sat Jul 11 20:22:51 2015 UTC,"Yet Kotori got hers fairly soon after the job ver. was released. Rin and Eli has been paired with Umi already. But idk, we'll see. c:    edit: waking up early = misreading orz"
SchoolIdolFestival,3cxyga,Tricksnyan,2,Sat Jul 11 20:25:02 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry, I mean as the next set of two URs. Obviously the next card will be Nozomi ;)"
SchoolIdolFestival,3cxyga,Tricksnyan,0,Sat Jul 11 20:25:52 2015 UTC,"Welp, no need to apologize I read that wrong, I just woke up zzz. Well I hope the next set will be Rin so I can use all my loveca + tickets. owob"
SchoolIdolFestival,3cw7gp,ArigatoHanayo,30,Sat Jul 11 08:00:01 2015 UTC,it's me (stands blocking the nozomi ur out of the way) i am the only one who can be umi's pair
SchoolIdolFestival,3cw7gp,syhetic,4,Sat Jul 11 09:33:21 2015 UTC,It has to be Nozomi.  Either way it's impossible for it to be Eli since Umi and Eli have already had a pairing and they're both Cool-attribute which wouldn't work since this set of URs is all main attribute.
SchoolIdolFestival,3cw7gp,luciusftw,3,Sat Jul 11 08:19:49 2015 UTC,"thank you , what would be its attribute?"
SchoolIdolFestival,3cw7gp,luciusftw,2,Sat Jul 11 08:26:34 2015 UTC,Pure (Nozomi's main attribute).
SchoolIdolFestival,3cw7gp,lolicon00,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:27:35 2015 UTC,arigato
SchoolIdolFestival,3cw7gp,luciusftw,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:31:50 2015 UTC,How did you find out the main attributes for everyone?
SchoolIdolFestival,3cw7gp,lolicon00,4,Sat Jul 11 09:02:49 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they're 'officially' listed somewhere, but you can tell by the stats they favor on their cards (like a Pure Eli will have Cool as her second highest stat), and their initial UR's attribute, along with a higher number of cards of that attribute. Also, most of them outside of Umi and Nozomi are pretty obvious.  Anyway, the Smile girls are Rin, Honoka, and Nico, the Pure girls are Hanayo, Kotori, and Nozomi, and the Cool girls are Maki, Umi, and Eli."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cw7gp,yaycupcake,2,Sat Jul 11 09:07:30 2015 UTC,Thank you! Hahahahahah Nozomi tho... maybe Shrine Maiden counter-balance to washi-washi? XP
SchoolIdolFestival,3cw7gp,Axiou,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:25:39 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to point out that their second highest stat isn't always their main attribute. It grenerally seems to be, but there are exceptions like this for example. Notice Umi's cool stat is actually her lowest on this card even though that's her main attribute."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cw7gp,luciusftw,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:18:03 2015 UTC,That's for UR only. :3
SchoolIdolFestival,3cw7gp,honoumi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:35:40 2015 UTC,Yeah I probably should have mentioned that event cards are always an exception
SchoolIdolFestival,3cw7gp,Sonoda_Umi,2,Sat Jul 11 18:57:44 2015 UTC,i'm pretty sure its nozomi since all the other characters that could be paired up with umi already have ur sets with umi ! also it should be pure attribute since her last ur was smile and the umi ur is cool
SchoolIdolFestival,3cw7gp,Tricksnyan,3,Sat Jul 11 08:28:59 2015 UTC,thank you so much
SchoolIdolFestival,3cw7gp,itsmikeomfq,2,Sat Jul 11 08:31:41 2015 UTC,It is going to be Nozomi. :)
SchoolIdolFestival,3cw7gp,Honomizu,2,Sat Jul 11 17:18:22 2015 UTC,Should be Nozomi.
SchoolIdolFestival,3cw7gp,Yomika,4,Sat Jul 11 08:03:13 2015 UTC,yey I'm hoping that she is <3
SchoolIdolFestival,3cw7gp,DearAny,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:03:58 2015 UTC,"The only person Umi hasn't matched with is Nozomi - and they've yet to do a double (two of the same pair with two UR sets), so it should be Nozomi! I'll pray that you get her!"

I feel if SMs were like token events then it would be a bit boring.. Score Matches are our chance of variety in songs - we get to play EX songs that aren't here all the time.  edit: I sound so confusing.. disregard my reply if you want as I didn't really know how to put my thoughts into words..
SchoolIdolFestival,3cvzac,hopelessaddict408,2,Sat Jul 11 06:30:33 2015 UTC,"You weren't confusing at all, no worries! I see the merit in having a nice variety of stuff to play every Score Match."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cvzac,yaycupcake,3,Sat Jul 11 07:13:45 2015 UTC,"While most songs do tend to be seemingly random, I did notice something...  On the more recent score matches on JP which have technical mode, the daily EX songs they've chosen include the featured member for the event. The first few only had one of their songs due to both dailies having the same attribute (and possibly in Hanayo's case due to her second daily song not being a flaming EX, maybe). But the current event has both.  Score match 16 was a Nozomi event and had Otomeshiki Renai Juku. Score match 17 was an Umi event and had Anemone Heart. Score match 18 was a Hanayo event and had Kokuhaku Biyori desu. Score match 19, the current JP event, is an Eli event, and has both Glass no Hanazono and Solider Game. So far Eli is the only member whose daily songs are both different attributes.  For the record, here's the attributes of all the members' daily songs:    Name Daily 1 Daily 2    Nozomi Pure Pure   Nico Pure Smile   Eli Cool Pure   Honoka Smile Smile   Kotori Pure Cool   Umi Cool Cool   Maki Cool Cool   Rin Smile Cool   Hanayo Pure Pure    So there are other members besides Eli who have two different attribute songs from their dailies but they haven't come up in a score match yet since technical was added. I'm guessing they will also have their dailies featured in future score matches, since I find it hard to believe they picked these songs randomly, especially now that Eli's score match has both of her dailies."

The rest is probably selected based on what hasn't been in the rotation in a while."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cvzac,milesmitsurugi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:58:19 2015 UTC,"in addition to this, the latest released EX also has a tendency of being featured in SM. this is currently happening with sentimental steps, and the last score match featured colorful voice. prior to that, we had happy maker in Umi SM, Kirakira and door in Nozomi SM, and LWB in Kotori. datte datte was skipped for reasons unknown but it was pretty heavily featured in medfes events. either way, you can probably expect the next SM to be packing either mou hitori EX or miraihana EX (or both!)  also, there's a trend where a past event song is featured (the current is mahoutsukai, the last SM had jun'ai lens, the Umi SM before that featured koi no signal, Nozomi SM had yuuki no reason, preceded by daring in Kotori SM). based on this, it's safe to assume that the next SM will feature the next event song in sequence: nightingale love song (and followed by futari happiness after that, and trouble busters in the one after that)"
SchoolIdolFestival,3cvzac,Marith_,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:40:18 2015 UTC,"This is out of nowhere, but I did notice a pattern going on.  On the first pool, it will always feature an event song for the first time AND it will definitely be on EX. To phrase this better, I'll use an example.  Score Match 19 has Mahoutsukai Hajimemashita!, Score Match 18 has Jun'ai Lens, Score Match 17 has Koi no Signal Rin rin rin!, Score Match 16 has Yuuki no Reason, etc... And while tracking back, the pattern seems to have started from Score Match 9. Although Mahoutsukai Hajimemashita! was the last token event before the 3 event types started to mix and rotate around, so I'm not sure what KLab plans to do next."

I'm sure you've rerolled many more accounts than you've done 10+1s."

I feel like luck is just luck, I do think that an SR or UR card gained by a solo draw FEELS more lucky when you just look at the one rare card as opposed to one amongst 10 rares staring right at you.   Also, it's easy to forget all the times you've wanted to throw your phone against the wall doing solo draws and getting rares when you DO get a good solo pull, so that might also skew the perception."

SchoolIdolFestival,3cvmto,didhe,4,Sat Jul 11 03:48:35 2015 UTC,"I suppose it is a solved problem since people have been able to rip assets from the game, but the people who are knowledgeable about this solution are probably Japanese. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, as I'm not entirely sure if our English LLSIF wikis source their content from Japanese wikis or grab the image files themselves. Currently, I suspect the former, but as I have mentioned, I could be wrong.  I'm quite interested in the same thing you are curious about, though. I have my theories about how it is done (thanks to this other KLab game that I play, which uses the same encryption, I believe), but I don't have anything to confirm it. Also, dummied out code or not, I don't think KLab uses this same engine you linked for their production-level mobile games. Especially when you consider how long it has been since their last update and the software license it is available under.  The files are definitely encrypted though. I still think they use a key somewhere, though this is most likely stored in the server. As for ripping the in-game assets, I think people must've ripped the decrypted version somehow from memory, as it's near impossible to get the said key from the server, unless someone's found a hole in the code where they could do some code injection.  I am unsure if they have the decryption code on the client side though. On one hand, I think it would be taxing on the server to do all the decryptions, but on another hand, it's a big security issue, having that code on the client side.  I haven't seen anyone post the decryption implementation though. Most likely because such a thing can get you in trouble with the law."

SIF and Glee use it. Unfortunately (like many other companies) KLab's idea of open-sourcing means ""dump and forget"", so the version of Playground on your device has been updated quite a bit (the GitHub version roughly corresponds to SIF 1.6, if you were wondering)."

Though I guess I'm still technically correct about them not using the same engine, considering what you said about it being outdated. Thanks for the info! Man, things are really different when there's a very dedicated fanbase for a particular franchise. ;w;  You also raise an interesting point regarding KLab, hahaha. Been wondering why they'd have Playground available with a very user-friendly license and this explains things a bit. Though I still can't fathom in general why companies would open source the code that contains one of their security measures."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cvmto,totsuka_no_tsurugi,2,Sat Jul 11 08:16:44 2015 UTC,"As far as game engines go, Playground is pretty standard. There aren't any killer features that are worth keeping secret.  The exact encryption implementation is of course stubbed out in the open source release. No harm in doing that, the important code is gone. The documented API can fit almost anything.  [However, having source code around helped a ton when I was reversing SIF.]"
SchoolIdolFestival,3cvmto,wafuu,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:32:05 2015 UTC,"the data format appears to be as specified, though of course there's no way to know based on that what exactly the program does with the data.  it's not really possible not to send the key to the device; it has to get there somehow, though I couldn't say offhand whether the key is store directly in the library code, sent over the network, or in the files themselves. the second seems really unlikely because all of the assets seem to be encrypted; the first is an (kind of broken) way to use a cipher, but not implausible.   regardless, the app itself must be able to decode the assets, so the key almost certainly must be getting sent to the user; anything else would be madness with the network activity, not really viable for a mobile game. would be noticeable anyway just by inspecting traffic.   based on the exposed interfaces and the requirement ""support fast and transparent decryption over a file system with random access"", it's almost certain that they use a symmetric block cipher (... literally, decryptBlck), anyway. I'm p sure that's not a requirement that'd change even if they don't actually use that engine. it's not unimaginable that their production code uses a different engine, but it would be a strange decision to write separate encryption.  but honestly this type of encryption can't possibly provide security because as long as the decrypted data is used on the client side, someone can trace the code and dump the data out of memory. it's definitely close-the-door-and-lock-it type security, not, like, military-grade.  ... as evidenced by the fact that we do have rips."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cvmto,DimensionSlip,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:46:51 2015 UTC,"The docs say that the key is based on a MD5 hash of the basename1 of the file being decrypted. edit: No it doesn't. Whoops.  1: Basename, n: A file name with the leading directories removed. ""/var/mobile/file.dat"" and ""/var/root/file.dat"" both have the basename ""file.dat""."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cvmto,deathfantasy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:15:08 2015 UTC,"Well, even if it's not military-grade security, it is still a type of security. It definitely isn't the best way to protect one's assets, but it's there for that purpose. And it does the job for the most part, considering that not all their games have a following as large as SIF does. It would take a pretty good amount of time and effort to figure out what it is and what kind of measures to take in order to get around it, so I'd say they've protected their assets from about 99% of players (who don't have an advanced programming background and/or the dedication/time to figure out how to get around their data encryption). Especially since this type of activity can get you in trouble with KLab.  That aside...  The encryption/decryption implementations I've seen that involve storing the key on the server don't necessarily mean sending the key to the user. All the client has to do is invoke the method that would do the encryption/decryption and pass the necessary data to be encrypted/decrypted. However, this only works if it's the server doing all the encryptions/decryptions, which is unlikely as you mentioned, as it would cause a lot of unnecessary network traffic. Just wanted to clarify, in any case.  Since we've established that the decryption happens on the client side, then it's a matter of figuring out if they store the key (if it exists) on the server or on the client. I did some network traffic inspection back in the day, for one of the other KLab games that I play, and I didn't see anything that could be a decryption key (unless you count this very long ID param that they use as a verification of sorts for your account, but I think it's weird if they somehow store the decryption key there too). Given that each mobile KLab game probably uses the same engine, then I suppose it would be safe to say that the case for SIF is the same. So I guess it's likely that the decryption code is already in the client-side software itself, and it's just a matter of finding out which file it is, decompiling it, and reuse it such that you can feed the assets to the code and have them decrypted.  I do hope you find the person who has your answers. I can't really offer much in the way of answers--only theories."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cvmto,Suyooo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:48:59 2015 UTC,"One can look at SoundAnalysis_MP3 in particular; it shows the general decryption flow. The corresponding source code is here; the compiled code can be read using your favorite disassembler. Unfortunately, like /u/Suyooo, my asm skills are next to worthless, so I would have to leave this to someone else more skilled than me."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cvmto,deathfantasy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:01:06 2015 UTC,"right, lock-on-the-door security. it's a bit of effort that someone can't just stroll in and take things, but not going to stop anyone who already decided they wanted to break into your house. just, there aren't too many of those.  anyway, if the server were doing all the decryption, there's no need to store data files at all on the client; hell, it doesn't even need to encrypt it at all, since it's not sitting on the client. would still have to be sent transparently to the client, though, which is MITMable.  (I'm trying to imagine a model which couldn't, but I'm just thinking you'd need to be designing or colluding with the hardware manufacturer to)"
SchoolIdolFestival,3cvmto,Mayumu,2,Sat Jul 11 22:20:23 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, all ripped assets came from memory dumps. It's no challenge at all to get gdb or something similar to dump the decrypted file after setting a breakpoint. Pretty straightforward and far more simple than having to figure out the encryption.  You can find out the algorithm for decryption pretty easily from one of the .db files, they are SQLite databases which have a nice header and lots of 00s making it pretty easy to see whether you're on the right track.  However, the problem is finding the key. From what I've figured out, it's 5 bytes, where 4 bytes are the actual key used for decryption of an 4 byte block, and 1 byte to modify the 4 byte key after every step. It's also based off the file's basename, that's where the key is generated from.  Now, that's as far as I got, because my assembler reading skills are terrible. I could see three ways to find out that final piece: 1) Disassembling the libGame files in the LLSIF data is trivial, and you could attempt to reverse-engineer that. As I said, I'm about as good at reading ASM as a potato is good at riding a unicycle, so that's out for me. 2) Brute force, which might work for a few files. SQLite files have a distinct header, Klab's proprietary image formats have 4-byte headers, JSON might be harder. 3) The decryption algorithm is the same algorithm used for encryption: it works both ways, and since the key is generated from the file basename it's also the same. With a special file crafted by you, and a memory dump via gdb at the ready, you could find out more. However, since the files which should be loaded are hardcoded in the game, you can't use a different filename and see how the key changes.  This is what I know - I don't know whether you have a particular set of skills, but maybe you can work off of the stuff I know."

Maki/Rin Constellation came 2 months after Rin's last UR (Cafe Maid) and 4 months after Maki's (Mermaid) despite the other two eventual pairs being substantially more likely, time wise. (Honoka/Kotori was 5/3 months and Eli/Nico was also 5/3 months.) Ditto Rin/Nozomi Valentine's Day - Umi/Hanayo was further away.  The shortest window we've ever had is 2 months (Cafe Maid Rin -> Constellation Rin and Fruit Bar Eli -> Wedding Eli), so literally any of them are possible."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cwxsi,lygodium,5,Sat Jul 11 14:55:01 2015 UTC,"Also I guess to elaborate for people who don't know why the pairs have to be Rin/Eli, Nico/Hanayo, and Maki/Honoka:  As we can see in this current set so far - Kotori is pure, Umi is cool, and Nozomi will be pure (notice how there were 2 smile SRs in the beginning of the set - this means that there will be a pure and cool UR in the pair, and Umi is the cool half).  From this, it's pretty easy to see that they're following the same pattern that they have in the past - UR attributes will match the girl's attribute. This means that Honoka, Rin, and Nico will be smile, Hanayo will be pure, and Eli and Maki will be cool.  We have never seen a UR pair with both girls having the same attribute, so it's almost certain that the pairs will look something like this:   Honoka - ? Rin - ? Nico - ?   Now what makes this easy is that Nico has already been pairs with two of the three remaining girls - Maki (Valentine's Day I) and Eli (Seven Lucky Gods). So she must pair with Hanayo.  After that, Honoka and Eli have already paired up, as have Rin and Maki. Which means that Honoka and Maki must pair up, as must Rin and Eli.  The pairs will be:   Honoka (smile) & Maki (cool) Rin (smile) & Eli (cool) Nico (smile) & Hanayo (pure)   This will take us through the end of October 2015. What pair comes when is based on whichever ones KLab wants to release in whichever order, probably based on set theme or similar."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cwxsi,lygodium,2,Sat Jul 11 19:29:39 2015 UTC,"It's (almost)definitely going to be Eli/Rin, Nico/Hanayo and Maki/Honoka, not sure what the order will be though."

SchoolIdolFestival,3cwxsi,sakurayukihime,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:27:47 2015 UTC,"Well.... The remaining pairs that haven't matched are: Eli/Rin Eli/Hanayo Honoka/Hanayo Nico/Hanayo. As you said.  There's never really a sure way to predict what card will come up next with a new set until the first part of the pair is released. From there, you can predict what the matching card will be, from what cards that girl hadn't already matched with. (I hope that makes sense, I'm terrible with words.)  But! The idea of ""longest period of time since a UR"" theory isn't really a solid theory. If that was true, this current Score Match on JP should've been a Nozomi, not an Eli. (Though, the Medley HAS to be Nozomi, to get off topic. If not, I'll cry.)  But I'm not sure. I'm just hoping it's another cute summer-themed set. :D"

Also if you have a friend who also plays SIF on their phone then ask if you can play a song or two on their device. If both the touchscreen test app doesn't register the taps on your phone, and you have no problems playing on your friend's phone, then its likely your phone's touchscreen is buggered like my old phone's screen was"

JP celebrates anything LoveLive themed, like how we got loveca for the movie, and can be used for promos if you buy JP products.   A word of advice, don't use up all your FP points as they come because the normals are almost doubled on JP then EN. Unless you don't care about max leveling award, stick to a few at a time and work your way to getting rid of them. Besides, saving those and loveca might be better because you won't know what cards will be coming next, which brings a little more excitement and gamble of who's going to be released next."

SchoolIdolFestival,3cuapi,hoshizorin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:56:44 2015 UTC,Nice job on the FC!  You should also consider making your UR Rin the center of the team because her leader skill is super strong. It's also currently the only card on EN with that skill!
SchoolIdolFestival,3cuapi,baconator25,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:29:30 2015 UTC,Ah! I wasn't aware of this! Thanks
SchoolIdolFestival,3cuapi,nicominaj,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:46:00 2015 UTC,How is her leader skill stronger than others..? I thought that leader skill didn't matter that much unless it was a UR
SchoolIdolFestival,3cuapi,baconator25,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:46:45 2015 UTC,"Most URs have the same leader skills; either Smile Princess, Pure Angel or Cool Empress. These cards take the base stat of their main attribute and multiply it by .09. However, there are a few select URs which have a mixed skill. This Rin, for example, is a Pure Princess, meaning your pure stat is increased based on your team's smile rating. Of course, an off stat is naturally going to be lower, so to make up for it, they have a higher multiplier (x.12). This results in a higher total almost all the time.  It's also beneficial to have friends with these cards leaders so that you can use the bonuses too!  JP has 3 cards for each combination, (So, three Smile Angel's, three Smile Empress', etc.) while EN only has 1-2 for each combination at the moment.  I hope that made at least a little sense. You can see all the URs with special leader skills here"
SchoolIdolFestival,3cuapi,nicominaj,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:10:11 2015 UTC,Is the bracketed number when you choose friends representative of the total additional points or is there something added to it? Because mixed leader skills always seem to give me lower point boosts as opposed to the common skills (and I've heard others say the same as well)
SchoolIdolFestival,3cuapi,baconator25,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:48:11 2015 UTC,"The number you see after you choose a friend (The number with a + in front of it) is the total bonus you get from all your multipliers/additives. That is, your leader multiplier, your friend's leader multiplier and your team's total bond points. I believe the formula is something like:  Team's main base stat + (base stat of attribute being used * your leader's multiplier) + (base stat of attribute being used * friend's leader multiplier) + Bond  Basically, the mixed leader skills should always give you a larger point boost assuming your team is mostly SRs+, but if you still have a bunch of Rs on your team, it's going to come out lower due to the non-attribute stats on Rs being significantly lower."

SchoolIdolFestival,3ctbh2,URnico,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:17:08 2015 UTC,Congrats on the rank 100! I have too many to count (I may have a problem with scouting). Saving all the good stuff for my main JP and EN accounts.
SchoolIdolFestival,3ctbh2,zenthesugoi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:30:55 2015 UTC,"3 regularly. I start off with an EN account and picked up a JP account a few weeks later. My EN is rank 209 and my JP is 151 currently. At one point someone gave me a UR starter account on JP and I decided to keep both JP accounts and my 3rd account is currently 102.   From experience, three accounts can be a hassle if you don't have a lot of free time (if you aim for tiers on multiple, or all, it can be really draining) but I've always found two accounts to be easily doable."
SchoolIdolFestival,3ctbh2,soundboythriller,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:34:06 2015 UTC,I have EN and JP. I used to have another EN account but I accidentally deleted the transfer code (and I had 47 lovecas too). I don't bother anymore but I might try for the hell of it if it was easier.

I don't know why, but it only happens when I play on a flat surface. So long as I play without blocking the back of the phone it's fine.  I wish I could help more with your specific issue though. :s Good luck!! Hopefully you find something that works!"

Maybe try lowering your screen sensitivity? Or maybe there is leftover bodyfat that still leads electricity? remember, the screens register a touch when something can transfer electricity, hence the giant problems when there's water on the screen or other substances."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cu9f1,Atomflunder,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:11:57 2015 UTC,There is no way to lower screen sensitivity on my model. There is no leftover bodyfat and my phone's screen is queaky clean. I've been playing with this issue for over 3 months (on this device) and I tried absolutely every possible way of pressing a note so it doesn't break. Guess I'm stuck with it.
SchoolIdolFestival,3cu9f1,Atomflunder,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:20:39 2015 UTC,"How old is your phone? Even though you say it's no bad spot, you might want to take into consideration that the screen might be broken. Maybe also your RAM gets very full at times and then it doesn't recognise the notes. Happens a lot with phones that a smaller RAM. Try ending all other apps before starting SIF.  I know you've probably read these things before, but sometimes it's easy to forget something and I can't really think of a different reason. There isn't really a bugged song or something like that.  If all else fails you might wanna try saving your account transfer ID and reinstalling the entire game."

SchoolIdolFestival,3cu9f1,Atomflunder,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:48:37 2015 UTC,"I'd say customer service and return the tablet, sounds to me as if the tablet is at fault.

Another user recently encountered the problem, that he traveled to jamaica and had a fine internet connection but still the game lagged out and some of his notes wouldn't be recognised.  Might just be server issues and, well, with a game that grew so big so fast you can't really complain about KLab not getting better servers, they aren't, dunno, Blizzard, and even such big companies still encounter server issues."

SchoolIdolFestival,3ctwek,PhiPhichan,3,Fri Jul 10 19:09:22 2015 UTC,"Hi, I always like listening to covers of songs, especially Love Live! songs! It is nice that you put in the hard work of learning this song to record. :) However... I will give you my honest opinion on your work. Your voice was nice! It had a cool tone, but you need training... your pitch was not there, and you voice was a little breathy in some part... I suggest you to play the vocals on the piano so you can hear each note. That will help you with the pitch~ I look forward to listening to your other recordings if you decide to do another!"
SchoolIdolFestival,3ctwek,Sonoda_Umi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:24:45 2015 UTC,"My pitch is kind of really low (especially when I sing in Japanese, I do better in english if it's about singing high) and when I do try to sing in a higher pitch my voice cracks most of the time. =/  I need to improve my range but I don't even know what's mine really, I can go as far as Loli if it's an almost whisper and it's just.. really weird range. x.x"
SchoolIdolFestival,3ctwek,Sonoda_Umi,2,Fri Jul 10 19:37:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was neccessarily your range... You just weren't hitting the correct notes. Perhaps it is because you are singing in a different language, and if so, I totally get you. XD It can be challenging."
SchoolIdolFestival,3ctwek,zillyno,3,Fri Jul 10 21:37:37 2015 UTC,"You have the words and pronunciation down, you just need to work on your pitch, and making your voice more...rhythmical? I can't think of a proper word for it. It sounds kind of flat, like you're just reading the lyrics off of a page. Just practice, practice, practice!"
SchoolIdolFestival,3ctwek,hachimongame,2,Fri Jul 10 23:33:24 2015 UTC,"Neat!! I think what might be sounding off is that to fit your range you mixed tones (ie, you sang some parts in the song's original tone, but when you hit the highest notes you dropped about two octaves and it didn't mix too well). I don't think you would be able to sing the full original bc it's really high even for low-pitch girls xD. So train your lows! (It might help if you have a program that lowers the pitch if you're not used to singing over a karaoke with the wrong tone, which is a problem to most singers bc we feel the need to go with it xD)  But your voice is very smooth and steady, so it was very enjoyable nevertheless!"
SchoolIdolFestival,3ctwek,kindeybean,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:50:13 2015 UTC,"Try softening your ""wo""s! You seem to really have a strong Wo sound going on there, but its supposed to be pretty subtle. When speaking really fast, wo can sound just like o. (An example of this is the names ""Kaworu"" and ""Kaoru""... They're supposed to sound almost the same.)  Also I notice that you slur some sounds together, so sometimes ""tsu"" comes out as ""chu"" or ""tu"" and some sounds just don't make it through. Japanese is different from English where each sound is really distinct (save for special cases like ""kute"" or ""suki"" etc), so make sure you enunciate!"

If you have emailed before, I believe they're asking for the name of the person who emailed you. Which devices/OSs you ran the game on, and if you used multiple, to list all the ones you used. They're asking for a transfer code you've issued before (obviously an expired one, as if it were valid, you wouldn't have to email them ;)) Names of your Units/Groups Names of your centers for your non-main teams Names of some of your friends Asks if you have exchanged any ingame mail, and if you have, to say what was written in them."

Once I got N members maxed out, I use them to practice other N members before moving to higher rarity. If there are no members to practice on, I'll keep the maxed-out N cards while the remaining N cards obtained from Live Shows are removed for G coins.  As an F2P player, obviously I rarely scout, so I don't have a lot of cards to practice on other than event SR cards."

SchoolIdolFestival,3csn4h,wind_7,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:30:06 2015 UTC,Yesterday I did 100 rerolls and got jackshit (4 SRs). Turns out I only have luck on my main lel
SchoolIdolFestival,3csn4h,nicominaj,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:44:21 2015 UTC,this is so true that I want to cry
SchoolIdolFestival,3csn4h,Helen_wenwen,12,Fri Jul 10 20:57:26 2015 UTC,"10+1 is always better than solo, even without guaranteed SR. It's exactly like doing 10 solos in succession, except you also get another one for free."
SchoolIdolFestival,3csn4h,nxAkari,4,Fri Jul 10 13:25:33 2015 UTC,"On average, you will get more SRs from the 10+1+guarantee than the soloyolos. This is because if the RNG gives you only Rs in the 10+1, you get one automatically upgraded to SR.  This is actually quite a large increase, because fully 30% of 10+1 draws normally have no SRs or URs.  So in all of those cases, the 10+1 is better.  Always do a 10+1 with a guarantee."
SchoolIdolFestival,3csn4h,Crunchy-hime,3,Fri Jul 10 13:27:12 2015 UTC,"90%+ of the time, 10+1 will always be better, because you will always get at least 1 SR out of it. 11 solos could very well mean 11 Rs, unless you have godly luck."
SchoolIdolFestival,3csn4h,BiiSalvatore,2,Fri Jul 10 13:20:50 2015 UTC,"10+1. It's painful for me to see pulling 11 consecutive Rs slowly but if I do 10+1 recruit (assuming that I get 1 SR & 10 Rs), it only pains me for a second. That's my reason xD"
SchoolIdolFestival,3csn4h,CornKaneki,2,Fri Jul 10 14:44:12 2015 UTC,"The only situation in which 11 solos would be greater than a 10+1 is when you want immediate gratification/disappointment, ie: only saving 5 gems at a time...  EVERY other situation 10+1 is better.... this is not a debate it is a mathematical fact"
SchoolIdolFestival,3csn4h,cychun87,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:52:53 2015 UTC,"Depends on your luck tbh. My first 10+1 got me 3SRs, the following two gave me 1 each (smfh)  I've pulled 2 SRs from solo's quickly. I feel like I should be doing solo pulls but I have crap luck with RNG so I will wind up with like 30 R's or something, so I'm stocking up on scouting tickets instead."
SchoolIdolFestival,3csn4h,Iocomotion,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:21:17 2015 UTC,"I've never gotten anything besides the guaranteed SR from 10+1s and I have super good solo luck, so.. solo yolos."
SchoolIdolFestival,3csn4h,ox6,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:30:37 2015 UTC,10+1 is without a doubt better.  You save 5 gems which can give you another draw and you are guaranteed to get an SR.  In the end though it all depend on luck.

SchoolIdolFestival,3csn4h,stevenquartz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:13:57 2015 UTC,"10+1 usually, although I've gotten all of my URs from either Solo Yolos or Blue Vouchers...."
SchoolIdolFestival,3csn4h,paradiseliving,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:45:01 2015 UTC,"To be fair, getting a UR from a voucher is not the same as getting one from gems or tickets... the stats heavily favor the vouchers in this case"
SchoolIdolFestival,3csn4h,cychun87,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:49:17 2015 UTC,it depends on each player's luck and theres almost no absolute answer of which one is better than the other. for me i had more luck with solo yolo including getting UR from it
SchoolIdolFestival,3csn4h,evilbride,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:26:10 2015 UTC,"depends. i did 10 scouts on my main and got all rares, so from then on i did 10+1s. at least they all guaranteed me 1 SR."

SchoolIdolFestival,3csn4h,Helen_wenwen,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:58:06 2015 UTC,10+1 during guaranteed SR right after the box changes (no more than 5 minutes after the maintenance after event ends) and one angry solo yolo after a bad 10+1 give best results. 11 solo yolos = 11 R unless you sold your soul or something.

SchoolIdolFestival,3csbtb,HonkersUnited,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:37:33 2015 UTC,"They keychain and that orange ribbon design on her back. If you're trying to make it blend into the card, pay attention to small details. Like, I saw that orange ribbon design on her back to be edited cause of the coloring of it (how the white lines look compared to the opposite side) and the keychain doesn't have black outlining like everything else does. Not sure if there's anything else different without referring to the original though."

It just started and it's only 8 minutes long per episode, but it seems to be more about idol fans rather than idols themselves. The CG is pretty cruddy, but you can't expect much from a short.  Also Locodol. It's an underrated budget anime that's more of a slice-of-life than an idol anime, but I found it quite charming and very down-to-earth.

SchoolIdolFestival,3cquvj,GeneralDoomsday,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:08:49 2015 UTC,It's always great to have cards of your best girl! Especially on EN where you can't really dig the system by only doing special scouting boxes because of their lack of guaranteed SR. But glad to see you've commented and hope you get the cards! I don't know if I'll even make the completion award for either this time but I'm planning on at least T2'ing for Kotori's event in EN.

Not saying that keeping ""Ni!"" for english would make it any better, but I digress.  Anyhow all jokings aside (regarding the actual dub being worked on), when NISA did the localization via Lull of the Sea dub, they really did a very nice job conveying everything pretty well; but for music-related anime, it's just not something I can get behind, using like K-on's dub as an obvious example. Though fine for it's time, but when switching the Japanese songs' counterpart and then back to english? It's inconsistent, and even if they want to invest in recreating the songs in English, it goes against pretty much why plenty of fans watched the show to begin with~ I think the Angel Beat's dub did something similar to this, and there's probably more examples as well, but you get what I'm saying.  I don't know man. I'm sure they'll get some pretty professional VA's, but this is the kind of show, like I said, that due to those issues, I really can't get behind ;~;"

Choosing which skill to use depends on what you wanna do in the game. If you wanna S rank score, then go for highest attribute by auto selecting, but if you wanna just FC songs or if you have trouble playing super hard songs then perfect lock characters and stamina up characters are better."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cqkw4,Khavonaki,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:48:48 2015 UTC,"Autoselect doesn't pay any attention to the skills on the cards, though.  So it doesn't know that your 2000 point healer card is worse point-wise than your 1990 point score-up card.

SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,NZRAI,2,Thu Jul 9 15:13:46 2015 UTC,"Paradise Live is pretty tough to describe lol. I learned it on guitar recently, and finding out there really is more guitar parts throughout the song beyond the solo, which I didn't really noticed until listening to the instrumental. Since it's mixed in the background more so then others, I just made up little licks and such to make it sound better since I could barely hear the rhythmic parts out of the song haha.  But after learning it and listening to it a thousand times practicing it, it definitely has that poppy, funky-like, bits of rock sprinkled through, kind of vibe to it, with electronic music heavy influencing the whole song throughout.  To me, its one of those ""you have to listen to it"" to really get and understand how the song is; which to me, that trying to explain it really wont do it justice, because man, it's such a kickass song! x)"
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,halfdarkshadow,5,Thu Jul 9 17:29:58 2015 UTC,"Mine is Mermaid Festa (I love the lyrics idk why), Soldier Game (the beat tho) and Passionate (HonoRin combo is love)  Though the song I love most is Someday of my life, for obvious reasons."

SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,Crunchy-hime,4,Fri Jul 10 15:50:03 2015 UTC,"Kaguya no Shiro de Odorita (dance, beat, just kind of sensational song to dance to), Love Novels (beat, really cute song especially the Baka part), Garasu no Hanazono (the lyrics), and Susume→Tomorrow (dance) are my favorites in orders."
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,IllusionaryRose,2,Thu Jul 9 13:50:23 2015 UTC,I love UNBALANCED LOVE because... Honestly I don't know why! I loved the Beatmap when it was an Event Song and after learning the lyrics I love the song even more (story of my life cough cough) And Loneliest Baby sounds really cool and mature
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,Yomika,4,Thu Jul 9 14:16:05 2015 UTC,"That's a tough question D: there are many I love. Hmm I have to go with LONELIEST BABY. Since first time I heard/played it, I was like ""omg this is so catchy!"" so I loved it. I play it on my phone a lot and sometimes my boyfriend plays it in the car and we just go crazy haha. That is a song I truly enjoy. It used to be START:DASH so I would say that's second for me, followed by No Brand Girls. As far as solos and subgroups, I have to say Watashitachi Mirai no Hana is first, followed by Binetsu Kara Mystery, then Ai Wa Taijyou Janai."
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,SpiritualPower,4,Thu Jul 9 15:45:38 2015 UTC,"fuyu ga kureta yokan, silent tonight, daring!!, watashitachi wa mirai no hana and eien friends~"
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,bifuku,3,Thu Jul 9 16:11:14 2015 UTC,"Probably datte datte aa mujou, loveless world and love marginal. Datte datte aa mujou really reminded me of this anime opening i loved (and repeated like 40 times a day), loveless world was really cool with them all singing powerfully about the pain of love which was really cool and that BG music and love marginal was always a top favourite (plus Printemps is my fave )"
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,kizukaaa,3,Thu Jul 9 13:49:05 2015 UTC,It's a toss up between Loneliest Baby and Shangri-La Shower. They're both really upbeat and catchy and just put me in an awesome mood when I hear them :D
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,hollowmoon,3,Thu Jul 9 14:01:32 2015 UTC,"Mine is a tie between Natsu, Owaranaide and Yume No Tobira BiBi songs in general are my piece of cake. Natsu, owaranaide is just really soothing and sounds unique compared to the other BiBi songs and idk it may be because I've played Ynt so much in the score matches that it's drilled into my head"
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,cherizard,3,Thu Jul 9 14:03:46 2015 UTC,Kodoku na Heaven ;w; I just reall love the music of this song and also Hanayo's voice. Also I can relate a lot to the lyrics. I also love Start Dash! I don't know why but I just love listening to it c':
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,TokiNanase,3,Thu Jul 9 14:20:32 2015 UTC,"That's a tough one... There's too many things to rate songs by...   For catchiness, Cutie Panther is by far my favorite. For rhythm, Anone Ganbare   Songs that I count among my favorites for less discernible reasons include Aishteru Banzai, Korekara no Someday, and Snow Halation."
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,Crunchy-hime,3,Thu Jul 9 14:26:13 2015 UTC,If you mean u's as in a song by all 9 of them then it got to be START:DASH.  My favourite song is still 私たちは未来の花 by UMI. 微熱からmystery is a close second
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,-NINCOMPOOP-,3,Thu Jul 9 14:45:57 2015 UTC,"Storm in Lover, Garasu no Hanazono, and Loneliest Baby are some of my favorites"
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,level6shift,3,Thu Jul 9 15:17:14 2015 UTC,"UUuh! That's though!  Well, my favourite song with all nine girls would be START:DASH!! because it's just too wonderful, I love also Mermaid FESTA (yes, it's not written ""Fiesta"", it makes me feel angry when you write Fiesta) Vol.1, LONELIEST BABY, Kaguya o Shiro de Odoritai, LOVELESS WORLD, mainly Cool songs are really nice!  Talking about subunits, my favourite subunit is Liliwhite btw, for BiBi my favourite song is Natsu, Owaranai De, because it's slow, and very sad. For Printemps, I really love Love marginal and UNBALANCED LOVE (Even if I'm a bit scared of Hanayo's I love you at the end...).  For Liliwhite, it's all another thing. It's difficult to choose my best song for my favourite subunit. I'll say Bynetsu Kara Mystery, because I just love the rhythm and the words! Then, in second place, Otohime Haato de Rabu Kyuuden, Shiranai Love*Oshiete Love, A-NO-NE-GAN-BA-RE!, Aki no Anata Sora Tooku, Onaji Oshi ga Mitai, in third place there are Kimi no Kuse Ni! and Futari Happiness, just because they're too slow.  I know, I'm Lilywhite trash.  For ""three people song"" I'll go for Listen to my Heart! and Susume -> Tomorrow (I prefer Listen to my Heart, though) For the duet, I'll say Garasu no Hanazono and Anemone Heart, they are soooo good!  For solos, I'm in fight between Someday of my Life and Daring!, they are both wonderful...  Ohgodican'tdecide!"
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,Honomizu,2,Thu Jul 9 15:59:27 2015 UTC,"Regarding Printemps; WHAAAAT, how dare you not put Eien Friends as your favourite!  Hahah, jokes aside, I like your list!.^"
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,halfdarkshadow,3,Thu Jul 9 17:04:34 2015 UTC,"There's too many but no matter how much I listen to Natsu, Owaranaide. I never get tired of it. Really good BiBi song, relaxing on the ears. I also love the unique beatmaps of the EX version, going circling and circling between the 9 members.  Also, the past two token events made me love Someday of my life and Arifureta Kanashimi No Hate.   Those songs are always in my driving playlist nowadays with Angelic Angel."
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,chibuki,3,Thu Jul 9 16:10:50 2015 UTC,"Soldier Game seems somewhat popular~ I also like that one a lot, along with After School Navigators, RinRinRin, Kaguya no Shiro de Odoritai, Paradise Live, Snow Halation, Susume Tomorrow...Anone Ganbare w/ a few other lily white songs... Turns out I can't pick one favourite ;n;"
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,signals-carf,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:19:03 2015 UTC,"I'm also seeing a lot of Loneliest Baby as well as a recent popular choice~  I've only listened to it once or twice which didn't leave any impression on me, but to be honest, I can't even recall what the song even sounds like xD I'll have to give that song another chance, because if quite of few are mentioning the song is really damn catchy, then it's definitely I have to re-listen to again! Cx"
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,halfdarkshadow,3,Thu Jul 9 17:09:49 2015 UTC,"I dont think I have a favorite!! its really hard to choose ya know? I do however, prefer the older. pre anime songs. Something about them is just more memorable to me! I also love Lily White songs and the NicoRinPana songs!"
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,Catnipfairy,3,Thu Jul 9 16:24:26 2015 UTC,"my favourite song is probably susume tomorrow (the tiny honoka solos make me go doki so bad...)!! but i love a lot of the other songs too!! some of my other favourites are wild stars, someday of my life, watashitachi wa mirai no hana, ruteshikisukishiteru, senko resolution, and paradiso (i forgot the full name)!!  although if theres ever a honoumi song itll probably be my favourite forever and ever"
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,honoumi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:40:10 2015 UTC,"Haven't seen anyone have Wild Stars as a favourite before~ That's definitely a first xD Still though, all the songs you mentioned are all pretty awesome C;"
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,halfdarkshadow,3,Thu Jul 9 17:11:56 2015 UTC,"Susume→Tomorrow, Soldier game, and   Shiranai Love*Oshiete Love if it counts"
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,dimensionwitch,3,Thu Jul 9 16:50:31 2015 UTC,probably Shocking Party /s  current favorite is KiRa-KiRa Sensation because it's so damn catchy
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,tsumugizzle,2,Thu Jul 9 18:50:39 2015 UTC,"I really like Loveless World ((because of the singing combos and solos, and the fact it's one of the few rock-like songs in the game)), After School Navigators (basically for the same reason as you said;;;)), Binetsu Kara Mystery ((i love Lily White, and i just like sound of the song in general!!)), and Listen to my Heart, Soldier Game and Arifureta Kanashimi no Hate because of the rhythm of the songs.  i probably should have just chosen a few songs, but im so indecisive;;;"
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,Hinata_Hajime,2,Thu Jul 9 13:27:06 2015 UTC,Soldier Game is absolutely one of my favorites. It's hard to explain but all three of the singer's voices really match well together and I'd prefer most of Maki/Eli/Umi's songs together.
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,Lynnelle701,2,Thu Jul 9 13:39:39 2015 UTC,"""Natsuiro Egao de 1, 2, Jump!!"" is my number one because it's so fun and catchy (""Summer Wiiiiing!"")! I love the beat, lyrics and all the characters sound great (to me) in it. ""Mermaid Festa"", ""Loveless World"" and ""A・No・Ne・Ga・N・Ba・Re!"" are rapidly moving in on the top spot too because of their beats and lyrics. ""A・No・Ne・Ga・N・Ba・Re!""'s lyrics especially as they speak to me on a different level from all the rest."
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,Inuzuka28,2,Thu Jul 9 13:51:17 2015 UTC,My top 5 songs:   Snow halation Watashitachi wa Mirai no Hana Otohime Haato de Rabu Kyuuden Silent tonight Dreamin' Go! Go!!
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,halfdarkshadow,2,Thu Jul 9 15:14:37 2015 UTC,"hmm, I think I have like 2 or 3 favourites xD  But typically any song that has a crazy solo that I can learn I pretty much like lol (via Susume -> Tomorrow as an example); as well as any rockish songs with Maki's mix in it, since she's one of the only singers that has a natural voice for that genre of music. Honoka is up there as well for the most part~  (閃光Resolution from the Kakumei desu ne? Kamisama! character album is a perfect example of Honoka's amazing voice Q~Q <3)  Anyway, up there would be (a recent favourite) is:   最低で最高のParadiso; I wrote a pretty banging guitar cover of this xD これからのSomeday (I think that's what it's called lol), because it has one of my favourite solo's ever from all the music lol, and it's adorable to listen to xD 夏色えがおで1,2,Jump!, mostly because it was the main reason I gave their music a chance/first song I ever heard/learned on guitar by them; Maki's/Umi's mixes preferred (exception is that I like Honoka's mix with a different solo alot better then the one more people are familiar with), but NOTHING can compare to Kotori's Q___Q  Like holy sheet, its sho cute! <3 それは僕たちの奇跡, definitely my favourite song of all time by them; and the choreograph and outfits are a definite plus and personal favourite as well<3 Such a well written song. I'd recommend taking a listen to the band edition done by a handful of different singers and musicians; via majority of the instrumentation and mix is creditted by Last Note., which UMPH soooo gud Q~Q http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm23985254   OH and Afterschool Navigators as well as Soldier Game is another as well! It's a blast to jam along to both songs on guitar lol. With Soldier Game, it really makes me wish that was a unit/sung more songs together; especially how the composition beautifully compliments Umi's tenor, and general bassier range; it makes her voice way more powerful, and probably the strongest it's ever been from every other song she sings, (exception is the Umi-dedicated songs, that were specifically written with her voice in mind; so of course they're going to be very good!).  Afterschool Navigators = #metal hahah. It was super fun to learn on guitar, despite I have to capo it because I play a 7-string guitar (in layman's terms, my guitar is pretty damn low haha xD), but I digress~  (and by the way, a better description then ""rock-like"" feel, is to say that's it's pretty much straight up metal lol. Hell it even has breakdowns in it ahaha. Kawada Takao written this and as well as a handful of the more rock-ish songs; adding the majority of his other works beyond Love Live can range from pretty hard rock to metal lol). But anyways, that's enough of my babbling lol~"
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,soundboythriller,2,Thu Jul 9 15:32:16 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I can't pick just one D: I'd say it's a tie between Takaramonos and Paradise Live. I fell in love with both of them the first time I heard them. Takarmonos just gets stuck in my head easily. Paradise Live, well I always really liked the instrumental part at the beginning, it just sounds really grand (for lack of better word lol). I was kinda disappointed by the chorus part, but I still like the song a lot."
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,Yumacaroni,2,Thu Jul 9 16:23:23 2015 UTC,"Beat In Angel. I just absolutely adore the fast pace! And the beginning is just so great, too."
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,wildsneezin,2,Thu Jul 9 17:34:48 2015 UTC,"It always seems to change for me but 'd say : - Mermaid Festa Vol. 1 - I'm not sure about reasons but I like it ┓(ﾟ～ﾟ)┏      Loveless World - I feel like everyone has put their emotions into this song. I especially love the last parts with Honoka, Eli, and Maki (Aishiteru to~ & background singing Ah~) Datte Datte Aa Mujou - I think everyone put the most of their voices into this song if that makes sense. Everyone has a distinct voice but it goes well with each other. Saitei de Saikou no Paradiso & Otohime Haato de Rabu Kyuuden - Currently top of the list in terms of the groups. Both catchy and pretty much draws a line between Bibi's and Lily White's music ""genre."""
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,paradiseliving,2,Thu Jul 9 17:57:58 2015 UTC,"Otome Shiki Ren'ai Juku, Anemone Heart, Colorful Voice, Daring, and Happy Maker! Most of them are upbeat and I just really like the tunes of them!"
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,thekuudere,2,Thu Jul 9 18:31:03 2015 UTC,"UNBALANCED LOVE because of the lyrics. Arifureta Kanashimi no Hate because it's a beautiful song and it's sung by Eli, the best girl. Garasu no Hanazono because NozoEli, and it's got a nice Russian pop feel to it."
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,TheGreatHoot,2,Thu Jul 9 18:47:12 2015 UTC,Definitely Paradise Live and Donna Toki mo Zutto. They're both fun songs to listen to and the lyrics for both of them are really nice. Also LOVELESS WORLD because it's just awesome.
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,saberishungry,2,Thu Jul 9 19:40:30 2015 UTC,"Beat in Angel, Yuuki no Reason, and Rinx3.  Not necessarily because I think they're the best 3 songs in SIF, but because I have the most fun when playing them.  My favorite based purely on the music, then probably Snow Halation."
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,Atomflunder,2,Thu Jul 9 19:43:18 2015 UTC,"From the normal hits it would be Mogyutto ""Love"" de Sekkinchu! mostly because of that ""PURE na Bouken!"" line from Maki in the first few seconds. I love that voice and the tone and GAH, just thinking about it makes me wanna play it  From the b-sides it is Nawatobi closely followed by Kodoku na Heaven. Hanayo's solos are amazing and her voice is so fragile and happy at the same time and sometimes sad, it's really well rounded."
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,Helen_wenwen,2,Thu Jul 9 20:14:40 2015 UTC,"I would say currently: Hello, Hoshi wo KazoeteRinRin and Sunny Day Song (both are the songs from the movie) and Start: DASH! (I literally cried in the anime)  for the songs earlier and sing by the whole Muse... (crap I have so many songs) -Loneliest Baby (ya!) -Kaguya no Shiro de Odorita (it is cool, no pun intended) -Wonderful Rush (Never get old of that song) For 2/3 people...(again, so many) -Zuruiyo Magnetic Today (NicoMaki is life) -After School NAVIGATORS (NicoRinPana <3) -Listen to my Heart! (oh the lyrics are wonderful) -Trouble BusterBiBi -Natsu, Owaranaide (oh my god BiBi you are monster you went from stupid/weirdo/funny style to goddess style)    For Solo:  -NawatobiPaNa  -Nico PuriNicoNicoNii-☆  -Someday of My Life (one of my fav event song at all time)  -Daring!!

SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,hoshizorin,2,Thu Jul 9 20:33:20 2015 UTC,"Oh my gosh this is difficult but easy to answer at the same time, only bc im love live trash and love the majority of the songs. however, I'd have to say the list of the songs that clicked with me would have to be Someday of My Life because I love that little tune in the beginning before the 1st verse. it sounds child-like and playful in a good way. Natsu, Owaranaide because I love songs that have that little hip hop sounding beat in the back, and its very soft and sweet sounding. Garasu No Hanazono. Just the whole song is sooo beautiful but the chorus is really what gets me. NozoEli singing together is magical. START:DASH because the whole thing gets me all pumped up, just how they're all singing together idk its hype. Lastly Koi No Shigunaru Rinx3 because its my bab y girl and her solo voice is beautiful. ""((∩´︶`∩))""  I mostly found myself liking LilyWhite's songs more than any of the others, there's just something about their sound."
SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,2srs,2,Fri Jul 10 01:25:47 2015 UTC,"So many to choose from!! I love how RinRinRin! is catchy, but then Cutie Panther is so cute w/ Maki..

SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,xiukai18,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:27:03 2015 UTC,"This is tough since I like so many of their songs...  For best sub-unit song, that would have to be A-no-ne-ga-n-ba-re. The vocals are great and the music sounds so funky.  My favorite duet/trio song is Yuuki no Reason (I have an Umi singing voice bias here). She sounds so clear and strong and the song is so catchy  My favorite song that they all sing together has to be LONELIEST BABY (so original, I know) because it sounds wayyyy different from anything else that muse does and i find myself singing it all the time"

SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,skidclo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:52:36 2015 UTC,"Perhaps A-NO-NE-GA-N-BA-RE! and Soldier Game. The former, I'm obsessed with Umi's powerful voice, and the fact that she booms it out after an enticing drum roll just made my jaw drop the first time I heard it. And a lot of people like Soldier Game for the same reasons I do, it's such a powerful song in a sense that I really enjoy the Maki/Eli/Umi combination. It has that hip jazzy vibe that's very cool."

SchoolIdolFestival,3co8gf,okitagumi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:04:03 2015 UTC,"Out of all of the songs I've cleared, Snow Halation and Soldier Game probably have the highest play counts just because I love listening to them so much. The former is so sweet and uplifting, and the latter is way too catchy and fun for its own good. (I wish Maki/Umi/Eli had their own official subunit because they really do sound so wonderful together.)   Besides those, I'd say that Aishiteru Banzai (especially the piano version), Susume→Tomorrow, and No Brand Girls are up there as well! Most of these songs are so memorable and enjoyable. It's very hard to choose!"

Re-visiting the tablet app won't cause any problems. It'll just say transfer was successful and if you wanted to start a new account.    :edit to add: Playing at the same time on both devices, if possible, would probably be considered cheating. Not sure how Klab deals with cheating but I wouldn't risk it. If it's purely one-at-a-time for convenience sake, it might be more arguable."

Another horrible thing are the hold+ladder sequences in Loveless World Hard, they were the main problem of mine with that live and I finally managed to FC it after around 45 tries. Surprisingly, the next 2 times I played it, I got through the holds+ladders with no problem, but still didn't FC it because of the rapid single notes at the very end."

SchoolIdolFestival,3coeg0,jellyfishgirl08,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:28:40 2015 UTC,"The most difficult pattern for me is when notes are rapidly spammed on a single position. Like in the chorus of soldier game hard or the guitar solo of binetsu kara mystery ex, or that one part somewhere in the second half of otomeshiki ex. SG hard took me an unusually high amount of tries to FC; as for the other two, I still break the combo on those damn things every time. I think I would do a lot better on randomized versions of those songs.  A have an internet friend whom I introduced to the game. She plays less than me, and says that she has no problems with patterns like that, and actually likes them. However, she seems to struggle with holds which I generally find pretty easy. If we weren't separated by countries, maybe we could team up and finally FC otomeshiki ex, which has plenty of both.  I also really hate it when the beatmap throws shit at me right from the start, that nearly always disorients me. e.g. colorful voice ex (even though I like the song and the rest of the map), beat in satan hard/ex, yuujou no thanks ex (even though I still think it's the easiest expert in the game).  As for the patterns I like, I'm not sure. Maybe series of short rapid cascades like in kokuhaku ex. If you asked about my favorite beatmap, I'd probably say korekara no someday ex. It's not challenging (for me), but it's still always fun to play because of how well it flows, and maybe that's actually what makes it easy."

Russian nouns, verbs and adjectives have a funny property - a gender, which may be male, female or neutral. A female person's/character's name is implicitly considered a female noun, therefore female verbs/adjectives are to be used when refering to it. /u/-NINCOMPOOP- used the male version of ""asian"", which implies that the subject, Eli, is a male."

SchoolIdolFestival,3cmgm4,BiiSalvatore,2,Thu Jul 9 01:32:32 2015 UTC,"""Play a lot"" and ""take a year"" don't go hand in hand in this case. I reached rank 100 after less than 4 months, and that was just some T2s and a T1s.   Either way, congrats, hitting a new digit is always awesome!"
SchoolIdolFestival,3cmgm4,kotorinico,2,Thu Jul 9 02:39:28 2015 UTC,That's why I'm confused. It took me probably 5-6 months and it took them a year? Especially when they play a lot? Just my thoughts.

SchoolIdolFestival,3ck4uc,Equus01,2,Thu Jul 9 14:25:50 2015 UTC,It's pretty easy when you're 5 or 6 and hitting wiffle balls around and your 2 year old sister wanders behind you because grandma lost track of where she is.  Clipped her chin on the upswing and didn't feel it...did feel when I hit her on the top of the head with the downswing.

SchoolIdolFestival,3co1ak,moichispa,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:48:03 2015 UTC,Eh.. I use them until I have replacements for them. I usually take the uglier ones that I've max levelled/bonded and sacrifice them to the holy UR or SR. Otherwise I keep some then sacrifice the rest I don't need.

SchoolIdolFestival,3cjlny,nico-nyazawa,5,Wed Jul 8 14:41:16 2015 UTC,I would get so mad when my boyfriend would text me. Like when I get a text it has a pop up on top of the screen and it's very distracting. One time he texted me like 10 times in a row but I forgot it was our anniversary

SchoolIdolFestival,3cjlny,AD712,2,Wed Jul 8 16:02:12 2015 UTC,You should temporarily turn off notifications while playing :p
SchoolIdolFestival,3cjlny,AD712,2,Wed Jul 8 12:37:07 2015 UTC,my love hate relationship with notifications will come back to haunt me someday lol
SchoolIdolFestival,3cjlny,moichispa,2,Wed Jul 8 12:41:42 2015 UTC,iPhones have a do not disturb mode which you can just turn on before playing. I'm sure android also has something like that. Unless you want to instantly respond to your friends while playing XD
SchoolIdolFestival,3cjlny,BiiSalvatore,5,Wed Jul 8 12:42:52 2015 UTC,Even though I've had an iphone for two years now I have just discovered the joys of do not disturb always. god bless apple.

SchoolIdolFestival,3cjlny,kotorinico,2,Wed Jul 8 13:29:03 2015 UTC,Not settings really just click on the moon like icon on the menu the lower part of the phone. You can also disconnect wifi there to run away from difficult songs on score match.

The only reason I would think of not to do this is when there's a lot of free loveca/scouting ticket promotions (back when we had the 2x scouting tickets/2 free loveca a day promotion, I scouted on some accounts  early, but that was really just bc i was too impatient to wait more haha)  Usually I make accounts the day before an event starts so that I don't get tempted to scout on them because I'm so busy with the events haha."

SchoolIdolFestival,3cmvf8,Crunchy-hime,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:29:10 2015 UTC,Any advice for tiering?
SchoolIdolFestival,3cmvf8,wildsneezin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:40:22 2015 UTC,"Hm...I'm not sure. It was my first time attempting T2/T1 so I kind of went in blindly and did my own thing. I didn't expect it too since I had 75lp, kind of weak teams, and woke up with max LP after a 9-10hr sleep.  So..the basics I guess..Avoid max LP, play when the event starts, and use the MOST of your LP before leveling up (i.e. Even if you don't want to play an easy and have 30 LP left, PLAY IT so your experience is at 1 assuming it was at 13  and you could play an expert right after, saving LP and gaining more event points and experience), and...have lots of gems to spare...last two days are the worst.  And a special bonus that I'm not sure if everyone knows already : During downtime, play until your experience reaches a point where you can play the event using all of your LP so you can pretty much get somewhat of a head start with an ""extra tank of LP."" If you're a math geek like me then you could pretty much use it to your advantage and get as much experience to level up. I'll let you in on some secrets if you're not a math geek ;3  I could give you the whole 10-day experience if you'd like. Hope this helps~  Edit: added stuff a paragraph"
SchoolIdolFestival,3cmvf8,kotorinico,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:02:24 2015 UTC,"also if its a token event make up a team of normies, and use them during normal lives (not the event song!!) bc if you get less than a C rank your xp reward is halved but you'll still get the same amount of tokens"

SchoolIdolFestival,3cmvf8,kotorinico,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:40:33 2015 UTC,it should only take three lives to get a team though! i just grab nine after grinding and make a team then keep them during the event then get rid of them but yeah youre probably right it is a lot of hassle but its good to have options!!
SchoolIdolFestival,3cmvf8,wildsneezin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:56:49 2015 UTC,I'm just used to feeding or selling them and it's hard to remind myself to do this or that after a live show lol I'll keep that in mind though when I'm close to leveling up xD
SchoolIdolFestival,3cmvf8,kotorinico,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:07:00 2015 UTC,i usually only do it when im close to levelling and then i'll feed them all and then do it again when im close again im really bad at remembering to clear out my normies ;-;
SchoolIdolFestival,3cmvf8,wildsneezin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:56:08 2015 UTC,The normies I get are usually the good ones so it's hard to get below a C score unless I'm super close to failing a live lol I usually wait until the message pops up that my member list is full since I got no one else to really level up xP

Smile, pure, cool, smile bond, pure bond, cool bond. the last one's angel and has all of my best girl cards, if I ever need a healing or a locking I just fiddle with the last. I don't like having to remove/mess with my formation when bonding and I'm very specific about number crunching my attribute teams to get the most out of them so that's the reason for taking up spaces for other slots.   edited to add I love the idea of themed team naming but I can never do it with the character limit at all. I can't even handle the character limit in my name field or profile. I realize Japanese is a space saving language but English isn't and it makes me sad sometimes that I can't do long ridiculous Fall Out Boy-esque names, or at least more characters.

SchoolIdolFestival,3clx0j,SerenityWind,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:55:27 2015 UTC,"Yep, quite happy with a few scouts. My first soloyolo on my EN account landed me the Yearly Greetings Umi. My first 10+1 on my JP account got me Wedding Eli. And then a 10+1 I did not too long ago allowed me to idolize my first SR (Magician Nozomi) which is pretty amazing considering I'm a F2P player."

I accidentally did the 1 time scouting and I thought that my life of SIF was over (I didn't want to spend more money) Then I did saw this R envelope floating out of the golden box, then suddenly, the evil R envelope turned into a wonderful cupcake UR envelope........... I screamed when I saw a UR Umi holding a wallet pooped out of the beautiful envelope. Later when I finally saved 5 lovecas, and did the 10+1 scout, I got the same UR White Day Umi with two SR Rins, then I fainted......  And that was my story of my wonderful Umi (and Rin) !!"

I was wondering about the apparent lack of Nozomis on your teams but the Nozocurse hit you so hard here I understand.  Yeah its ok to disconnect playing as much as you seemed most have took too much free time. Have fun with your free time now.  Tell the person who may get the account that if he or she is planning to sell or feed the Nozomi curse I will hunt him/her down.  Not like he can scape from having her on the profile. (fixed)

SchoolIdolFestival,3ck3du,Joaozito12,3,Wed Jul 8 15:44:39 2015 UTC,"You only get the code if you purchase a box of the Weiss Schwarz, not a single booster."

SchoolIdolFestival,3ck3du,kayochin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:58:51 2015 UTC,"This should probably be in the Q&A post since it's a single question with one answer rather than a discussion, but I do feel like it's a mistake a few people could make.  Someone can correct me if I'm wrong but I believe the one that comes with the code is this box, which runs about $60 on up on various websites. There are single booster packs for $15 or so that you can buy but won't come with any promo code. There's no way to predict which group of girls you'll get when you buy the box (they come in sets of three, while this giveaway is expired you can see the sets here), and even if you get multiple copies of the box you run the chance of getting doubles rather than all nine. There's no way to redeem a single girl.   I hope the card you got was nice at least, op! I think they look quite lovely even if I have no idea how to play. I don't know if you're interested in buying the whole box, but I would check out the promo cards stats and see if that combined with the rarity is worth it."

If in the future I reach a point where I HAVE to get rid of SRs, I'll probably drop those ones I'll never main (IE my worst girl for sure and other ones I don't particularly like / won't be able to use since I min-max)"

With majority of my SRs are event exclusives and as a event SR collector, I do not wish to sell off my event SRs and would rather 'waste' some lovecas for the expansion so I can keep them all.   Although the earlier event SRs are very weak, they serve to remind me of how long I have played, how much I had improved over the past 15 months and how much I struggled with the earlier events while tiering with many sleepless nights (due to low LP pool, playing on an old ipod and not having data yet)."

I don't think you should get rid of them since they are rare, but if you do, they will be in the album waiting for your embrace. If you haven't already, get rid of normal/rare cards and buy more space. 5 gems is 15 extra spaces which is a fair amount."

If you've decided to quit that's great and I'm glad for you. I know a lot of people are happy with the game and really it's different for everyone. No one knows your personal priorities/circumstances, and while it might seem like everyone here is completely obsessed with the game we're real people with real lives. Hopefully, at least, we have families and goals and ambitions and dreams - even if they're small ones like getting a good sale at the grocery store or waking up. I've seen people joke about joining the no-life club and it sort of miffed me but I didn't say anything because let them joke, but ultimately people come on this subreddit to talk about these girls and this game that gives them something in addition to their lives. If the game no longer is doing that for you either do a break like I did or quit.   It might be best to give away your accounts completely if you're 100% intent on quitting, and I personally feel that if you do decide to come back the fun of setting up a new account is also really great. I feel like everyone else said a lot of good things about why they play and I'm planning on continuing to play myself, but I figured you could use a slightly different opinion.  edit saw you did a giveaway! I'm glad you made the decision and I'm wishing you the best."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cj9fw,kayochin,3,Wed Jul 8 14:47:48 2015 UTC,I play pretty casually (I mean I tier for events but I only have one account and I'm a F2P) so I probably won't quit for a while. I want to at least get full idolized SR teams and maybe some more URs before quitting. As a F2Per I have a long way to go. Of course if I ever get too busy or just tired of playing I'll quit then as well
SchoolIdolFestival,3cj9fw,Vivo999,3,Wed Jul 8 10:37:27 2015 UTC,"If playing ever turns into a chore, it's probably a good idea to quit. The game should be fun to play, and the moment I stop having fun I'll at least scale back. (Haven't fully quit yet but I've gone from not wasting a single LP to super casual.)

You may not feel like it now, but you're going to end up quitting (or taking a break at the very least) from this game one day the day Klab shuts down.   So I suggest just keep enjoying the game, no need to ponder about quitting when you're still in deep."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cj9fw,snodeer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:19:13 2015 UTC,Klab will NEVER shut down XD but I already decided
SchoolIdolFestival,3cj9fw,SpiritualPower,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:21:19 2015 UTC,Klab isn't immortal... lol who am i kidding. Our grandkids will still be playing this thing XD Decided?
SchoolIdolFestival,3cj9fw,holykayochin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:26:08 2015 UTC,LOL! well yeah... and I decided to become a human again!
SchoolIdolFestival,3cj9fw,Altiex,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:33:03 2015 UTC,"I'm a total whale but I don't let this game run my life. I tier for events for cards I want, usually spending the first 3 days playing like mad to get my score really high, then just maintaining that level as much as I can over the rest of the event. For events I'm not as excited for I'll just play the energy bar as it refills.   That said I'm a working adult so I can't just play SIF all day long either. It's a good stress reliever when I need a break, and I know which stall in the ladies' room gets a wifi signal. :D I'll be playing as long as the game is available to play."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cj9fw,kkamikami,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:31:28 2015 UTC,"I don't see myself quitting it, soon being a year in August since playing SIF. Nor I think I ever would. I enjoy rhythm games a lot, and by a lot, I mean I could spend countless hours playing a rhythm game.  With the content that JP gets, and EN will get after a year, makes it worthwhile to stay. (Especially the new upcoming interface on JP they previewed some time ago). Especially the cards. And A-RISE (Private Wars on JP, hell yeah~).  The only time I'll probably quit it if KLab closes SIF (if that ever happens when whales feed them money)."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cj9fw,AniMage12,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:42:25 2015 UTC,"I've been getting a bit discouraged recently with playing. I work six days a week for 7-9 hours a day so it kinda kills my chances of doing well in events... :c Edit: oh and also the frequency that double notes dont register. What's the point, I can hardly full combo anything because of it"
SchoolIdolFestival,3cj9fw,SerenityWind,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:03:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I can understand why some people would want to quit. As fun as this game is, it can also be very shitty if you don't get what you worked so hard for. So far I haven't felt a big disappointment, so I can say I don't see myself quitting anytime soon. After this Nozomi event I'm gonna try scouting for her, though. So if I don't get her, I don't know how I'll react ;____; haha"
SchoolIdolFestival,3cj9fw,UmiLife,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:06:58 2015 UTC,"hmm i won't be quitting the game anytime soon, but i can see why people might, with the new sunshine girls coming out the muse girls will eventually stop ;_____;   But another way that i like to justify playing so much and maybe spending money on the game is, if you think about minimum wage (im going to use $8/hour) and think about how much a person plays  (im going to say 100hours for high rank player) i'd like to think of it as $800 worth of effort and fun getting taken out of it. I know it's not actual money, but i feel as if, if someone spends money and keeps playing the time spent on the game will be well worth it.But if someone gets too busy or doesnt get enough satisfaction from playing anymore it's totally justifiable.  For me personally i'm not gonna quit soon because im getting fun out of idol hell even if my luck is bad . i havn't spent any money on the game (but i have bought some LL merchandise) but may in the future. im also crazy about Hanayo  So it's okay if you want to quit, but i don't want you to have negative/mixed feelings about how much time you have spent on the game. i hope this helped a little"
SchoolIdolFestival,3cj9fw,danceordie9173,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:25:35 2015 UTC,I definitely can't see myself not playing this. I'm so deep at idol hell I even have a idolized UR Satan card.
SchoolIdolFestival,3cj9fw,nanamiin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:35:56 2015 UTC,"Well there's the money, there's the time... Currently with love live sunshine, the future of the game looks uncertain. I wouldn't be too happy with them adding Aqueos in, because that's kinda like a slow gradual process of letting u's die off.  Another consideration is, having seen some cards on the JP Server, it feels like the standard has dropped, and they're starting to recycle concepts. So the game is kinda losing the novelty here... I'm huge on visuals you see."
SchoolIdolFestival,3ck94l,gozieson,3,Wed Jul 8 15:49:02 2015 UTC,"Supposedly, she has a broken appearance rate that makes that card appear more frequently. I already idolized her, too...  On a side note: Who in the world would trust Nico to be a sensei??"
SchoolIdolFestival,3ck94l,thekuudere,2,Wed Jul 8 16:43:25 2015 UTC,"Supposedly, she has a broken appearance rate that makes that card appear more frequently.   That is certainly the case."
SchoolIdolFestival,3ck94l,-Ceris,2,Wed Jul 8 17:50:50 2015 UTC,Sensei for Idols :P (You would UnderStand if you finished the anime)
SchoolIdolFestival,3ck94l,DearAny,2,Wed Jul 8 22:46:37 2015 UTC,"Oh, I have. She is holding a little booklet that says Idol with her picture on it, so I'm assuming that's what she teaches...  Her side story for this idolized card shows how terrible she'd be in this type of job, though. At one point she just says, ""Just understand it, OK? Understand it!!""  Like Kotori as a policewoman...can you imagine? She's the least intimidating character next to Hanayo."

Before sending out the codes, make sure the random winners aren't brand-new or giveaway-grabbers. Even if they can't get more than one, more posts means more chances at winning. (And some people use more than one account in the game.)  You should also make sure that they use the EN server. I doubt the codes would work on JP."

SchoolIdolFestival,3ch98r,bathingsoap,2,Thu Jul 9 04:16:59 2015 UTC,"You ""feed"" them to anyone. I suggest giving them only to SRs/URs as they're the ones you keep for a long time. ""Feed"" means to give them to your members by means of practicing if you didn't know already. Teachers and Alpacas are great for practicing since they contain lots of experience.  The rest like the Yazawa siblings, Moms, and side students (not N cards) are for skills. The skills only level up if the card has the same skill level, color, and card rarity as the one being practiced on. (Siblings for R cards, Students for SRs, Moms for URs)  That feeling of clearing out space in the member list is as great as getting an SR from solos. ;3 Hope that helps! :D"

SchoolIdolFestival,3cikvl,jirachiex,2,Wed Jul 8 04:57:25 2015 UTC,"Teru teru bozu:       Teru teru bōzu (Japanese: 照る照る坊主、てるてる坊主; literally ""shine shine monk"") is a little traditional handmade doll made of white paper or cloth that Japanese farmers began hanging outside of their window by a string. In shape and construction they are essentially identical to ghost dolls, such as those made at Halloween. This amulet is supposed to have magical powers to bring good weather and to stop or prevent a rainy day. ""Teru"" is a Japanese verb which describes sunshine, and a ""bōzu"" is a Buddhist monk (compare the word bonze), or in modern slang, ""bald-headed""; it is also a term of endearment for addressing little boys.

SchoolIdolFestival,3cixkf,hellasweg,3,Wed Jul 8 07:14:04 2015 UTC,"Well, the general tip is:-   Use Loveca only in 10+1s. You can SOLOYOLO if you feel lucky. But do you really want to waste 5 of them just for your pride? If so, then welcome to the club Use your time efficiently. The timer on your phone could be used so that you won't waste a single LP. (Note that you recover 10 LP = 1 hour) You can use this method especially in events. Don't worry. If you can play Hard, no matter how much you suck, (like yours truly) you will get the Event SR by the end of the event. Or you can waste like 5 LoveCa to restore your LP at the final spurt (the last day of event) if you still haven't gotten the SR. NEVER use your LoveCa to continue a song. Event Songs can be contemplated. You should only do 10+1's when you can get a guaranteed SR. That way, you can get a stronger team rather than gambling and only getting like 11 R's. If you managed to get 95% Perfects or something like that in a Hard song, time to gamble for Experts. And then get disappointed because you just YOLO'd Expert but get crushed because you were playing Soldier Game... THIS IS NOT FROM MY EXPERIENCE, OKAY Don't do 10+1's just yet, since the blue tickets should be implanted in ENG soon.  Just... Well, have fun. Move it to the groove. Bond with your Idols and make sure to not regret anything. Sacrifice your soul to God Honks (It's required. Duh.)   EDIT :  * NEVER let your LP stop recovering/reach max"

SchoolIdolFestival,3cixkf,nxAkari,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:28:16 2015 UTC,"I've never gotten the event SR in my life   Play more, basically. Most of the time, it's entirely possible to get the event SR without using a single gem if you don't let your LP bar stay maxed out for too long. Hell, in the previous event I wasted a ton of LP and still got the SR on both EN and JP without using a single gem, even though I thought I wouldn't. LP management is especially important on low ranks where the limit is so low. I wouldn't advice to lose sleep over it though, but that's your call."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cixkf,wildsneezin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:36:09 2015 UTC,"Since you're just starting, don't expect an event SR yet. I'd say, for now, just learn to get better and work your way up to playing expert songs. If you're OK (not full comboing) at normals, then make your goal hard songs. Don't waste your gems trying to clear songs and maybe avoid doing solo scouts. Also, avoid scouting on non-guranteed periods. It'll help for improving your team. It's a safe-zone.  Event-wise, go ahead and play them. Just get some free stuff by racking up some event points. Play like you usually do. No sweat. Just be patient until you reach maybe rank 40-60 to start getting those event SRs, maybe even tiering if you can do it (but many gems will be used).  Ranking up (leveling up)-wise, use the most of your lp before leveling up. You save lp and makes it a bit easier to level up along the way.  TLDR Don't worry about it. It's how most people start off. :)"
SchoolIdolFestival,3cixkf,SakuraPanko,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:36:28 2015 UTC,"This game is very rewarding to people who put the time into it. At your rank you'd still be considered a beginner. As you play more, you'll reach a point where you've max bonded most of the normals and can start using them to level up your team, which will make events easier. Save up for 10+1 draws, especially early on as having more SRs will come in handy."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cixkf,SakuraPanko,2,Wed Jul 8 08:11:16 2015 UTC,thanks :) last night my love gem hoarding payed off and I got an SR Rin from honor student scouting !!!.
SchoolIdolFestival,3cixkf,SiFMadeNicoMaiWaifu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:02:02 2015 UTC,That's great! Rin is one of my favorite girls. Next time I recommend holding off until the guaranteed SR is effective. I'm glad you got an SR but I also don't want you wasting gems and getting 11 Rs!
SchoolIdolFestival,3cixkf,Vivo999,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:10:54 2015 UTC,"Farm gems. Then do 10+1 roll. And use whatever you get.  :V While you do the event with a max bond team, grind up another new idolised 2-star. Get that gem. Refill LP.And push on ;8; I'm doing that on JP and EN. So many gems gone but SO WORTH."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cixkf,Tricksnyan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:18:24 2015 UTC,As long as you play from the start of an event and use all of your LP you should get the event SR. Mind telling us what you think you are doing wrong?
SchoolIdolFestival,3cixkf,Helen_wenwen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:58:41 2015 UTC,"I think you hit the nail on the head for me, I never play the event as soon as it starts so I guess thats probably why I believe im terrible at achieving the event SR while only being on my low level."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cixkf,Naikode,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:59:18 2015 UTC,"This should be flair as discussion rather than issue.    And you just gotta spend your LP before it reaches max. If you keep doing that, you'll surely get an event SR. And when you rank up higher, it'll be easier."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cixkf,Altiex,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:01:14 2015 UTC,thank you I was unsure of where to post this because it didn't seem to fit in with discussion. I have discovered that utilizing your lp as soon as it refills it the best way to play.
SchoolIdolFestival,3cixkf,Jaeya,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:56:51 2015 UTC,"you are like me. I started around mid May, but I am currently at rank 63 for EN and 60 for JP...   I am in a rush so only gonna talk about a few tips:   in event, if you wanna get the SR, wake up at night for a couple times is needed. (in other word, never let your LP stop recovering) the song with higher LP points are the ones with better gold/EXP/LP ratio. (well you have to clear it in the first place xD)   For your first few events, don't worry about it. Since all your team looks good, try aim for them. as long as you don't waste a lot of LP, you should be able to get them. I already got 2, and is aiming for both SR in both EN and JP. So you can do it I believe in you :)"

Eli was my second account but it's now my main, while Hanayo is nearly on par with it thanks to two SRs from scouting tickets despite being eight ranks weaker.  I run three because I'm addicted to this game, basically, and now that I've got a decent handle on EX songs, I'm not getting my fix playing one or two of them on each account. It's tedious jumping three accounts all the time, but I try to get in as much play time as I can, so I do it."

SchoolIdolFestival,3chktc,donutsniffer,4,Tue Jul 7 23:54:30 2015 UTC,"This is actually a very important question to me. I'm a thumb player and I find that the position I play in is very crucial in differentiating between pressing a ""Great"" or a ""Perfect"".  What I find is that as a thumb player, it is not really the position in which you sit/stand which affects your accuracy. It is more of a combination of your focus (are you sleepy/tired/drunk?) as well as the positioning of your thumbs on the screen.   What I mean by the second point is that there are 2 different factors. First - are you clasping the phone too hard? If so, it might affect the 2nd factor - are you using your whole thumb or just the top joint to press? I find that the greatest success comes when I use the whole thumb to press.  However, this presents another problem - the speed at which you are able to depress your thumb and importantly, the speed at which your thumb leaves the screen. All these are subtleties actually affect me quite seriously whenever I come back to the game after a break (i.e. in between events).  Having said that however, I find that I tend to play well while on the bus, standing up. I believe this to be due to a psychological effect. It seems that if I'm in a busy environment, its easier for my mental state to be more alert to what I'm doing and thus my reaction time decreases. The motion of the bus does not affect my playing.   At home, I used to play while sitting up in my bed, but now I find that the best results come while I'm in a not too comfortable position such as sitting at a desk.  Hopefully this sparks some discussion over thumb players on their positions, as consistency is the biggest problem I face about this game."

I get monster claws. So while I use my thumb to hit the far corner, the tip of my nail could also touch the other corner, it's awful but I have to keep my scary witch hands aesthetic."

SchoolIdolFestival,3chktc,Crunchy-hime,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:27:37 2015 UTC,"I really agree with (most of) this omg  I also play with thumbs since I have an iPhone and my hands are on the small side, so no tablets for me. Setting my phone down and using pointer fingers just doesn't do it for me. Anyway, something that I find affects my performance is whether or not I'm tryharding and focusing intensely on the notes. I do better when I'm slightly zoned out, which is hard to replicate consistently. I guess it's because I'm bound to tense up at one point due to worrying so much, messing up my combo. Like, a lot of times my left thumb will just ??? and kind of slide on the screen when notes come up quickly and close to each other instead of being picked up and hitting each note individually. I'm right-handed though, so the same doesn't happen to my dominant thumb (?).  Oh, and kind of like OP I tend to have long nails, except I grow them out because my hands look far better with them like that. So sometimes that gets in the way of hitting notes ug h  idrk what this has to do with your comment anymore but i just thought i'd share"

SchoolIdolFestival,3celzk,Valtica,5,Tue Jul 7 12:43:04 2015 UTC,Yay you're back! Hope you'll be safe from the typhoon! owo
SchoolIdolFestival,3celzk,Tricksnyan,3,Tue Jul 7 09:46:19 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for your hard work in tracking this. I thought it seemed a little competitive but I wasn't sure if that was just me being frustrated that I'm not ranking higher.   I'm kind of surprised, honestly! I thought this event would be kind of mellow because of how many people have said that the idolized version of this Nozomi is ""ugly""."
SchoolIdolFestival,3celzk,kohikari,5,Tue Jul 7 17:59:15 2015 UTC,"I thought the same? I figure it's either the card's stats, or the fact that it's a smile SR and the last one was froggie Rin which even more people didn't want, or just Nozomi."
SchoolIdolFestival,3celzk,kayochin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:21:20 2015 UTC,"i don't think transformed is ugly, but i do prefer the untransformed. i'm T2 anyway because i'd do anything for nontan (´；ω；`)."

SchoolIdolFestival,3celzk,Equus01,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:27:07 2015 UTC,In your case if you go for T2 you basically get 2 SRs! (Or 3 with T1) and you can idolize it once you start filling up all the spots.  Compared to spending 50 gems for 1 SR I'd much rather hit T2 in 3 events with the gems and get 3 Idolized SRs
SchoolIdolFestival,3celzk,GL1TCH3D,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:15:28 2015 UTC,"Absolutely!  That's why I'm trying to T2 most events nowadays, especially on EN since we don't have blue vouchers yet.  I think every one of my teams could at least use another idolized SR, so why not?"
SchoolIdolFestival,3celzk,Equus01,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:18:37 2015 UTC,"Besides the UR center member bonus, I believe an idolized SR should match an unidolized UR in stats"

SchoolIdolFestival,3cij6t,zzblackhawkzz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:34:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I completely agree with that. I imagine it'd be way harder to come up with a rhythm where you only hit roughly once per bar compared to significantly more. One that immediately comes to mind is Afterschool Navigators, the rhythm is so obvious it basically maps itself, especially in the breakdown-esque section, mapping that for easy would be such a chore in comparison."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cij6t,Varianced,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:54:34 2015 UTC,"Well, the natural thing is that the easy is recorded, then normal, then, hard, then EX."

SchoolIdolFestival,3cij6t,UmiMakiEli,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:25:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, as far as I can tell, EX charts are charted independently of other difficulties. At the very least, there are enough incongruities between many songs' Hard and EX charts (namely, parts where Hard has notes but EX does not) that one cannot say one is based off the other.  Now, whether Hard is charted first or Easy... that, I don't know."

SchoolIdolFestival,3cig60,HonkersUnited,3,Wed Jul 8 09:40:07 2015 UTC,Score matches for me. Mainly because it's less time consuming but also because whenever I'm trying hard to FC the event song i end up screwing up more and getting a B combo
SchoolIdolFestival,3cig60,GlumpGloomp,2,Wed Jul 8 06:03:35 2015 UTC,"Everyone says token events are technically the easiest (at least, most people I've seen say) to tier. I think it's probably true, but I don't like token events. The many strategies and the fact that I'm not directly getting my event points annoys me to no end.   Medfes are cool but thing is, with so many rewards that boost your gameplay, it's like everyone is going as well as/can go better than you. Wouldn't say it's the easiest. I like tiering Score Matches the most; interacting (as much as it's possible in SIF heh) with other players is too much fun. I feel like there's a more of a ""game"" feel."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cig60,loneliestbaby,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:59:08 2015 UTC,It really depends on the girl for each event. For example rin is not very popular but umi is so more people will go for the umi one then the rin one
SchoolIdolFestival,3cig60,LovelessWorld,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:01:55 2015 UTC,"I love token and medley events, but I've only ever attempted to tier in score match and those have been pretty easy for me. I think token is great because you can choose which songs you want to play and you know going in whether the event song is going to be a handicap due to your card attributes."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cig60,ILoveMySenpai,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:08:17 2015 UTC,"Generally, Token event is the most easy. But depends on featured girl, it might be different."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cig60,emitsun,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:10:14 2015 UTC,"So far I've tiered on 1 Score Match and 4 Token events, and I've have one attempted tier on Medley (Kotori MedFes + JP = RIP). Obviously the hardest to tier so far has been the Score Match, but that was back in February when the tiers were much lower and my Rank wasn't as high.   Ultimately it's down to which girl it is and (for me) whoever is next For example, I love Nozomi, but since Kotori is the next event [and she has a UR after that event] I decided not to tier. and what their designs are. Some people might like the unidolised version and not tier, some people might like both versions and go for T1."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cig60,BiiSalvatore,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:16:49 2015 UTC,"Token, to me, is the easiest. Save up on tons of tokens for the first few days and when the 4x part starts, rank away! Of course, the event girl is always a deciding factor."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cig60,SerenityWind,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:19:55 2015 UTC,"Event type-wise, I have found it easier to tier on token events, but by far score matches have been more enjoyable to tier during. Haven't had the pleasure of Medley Fest tiering on account of not having a viable JPN acct to try to tier with.  Girl-wise, depends on the card. I have found Honkers stupid easy to tier for because she's just not that popular. Heard Rin is also pretty easy to tier for as well."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cig60,juungi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:44:41 2015 UTC,I think Token cuz you rank up faster. I have yet to experience Medley Festivals ;A;
SchoolIdolFestival,3cig60,SpiritualPower,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:48:45 2015 UTC,"Token events are easiest imo, but I prefer to tier in medley festivals because it feels like you get ""more"" (aka, extra rewards from all the extra songs you play) for each loveca you pump in haha."

SchoolIdolFestival,3cig60,Iocomotion,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:58:18 2015 UTC,RNG is actually the reason I like Score Match. Occasionally I can't deal with having to decide which song I want to play - I want the game to decide for me. Kinda makes me wish there was a Random option for Live Show. D:

SchoolIdolFestival,3cecn6,ceratopian,19,Tue Jul 7 06:37:14 2015 UTC,"I really didn't expect this the moment I woke up xD Thank you to everyone who voted for my banner! I'm actually quite speechless right now-- Erm.. If it cuts out for anyone, is anyone willing to tell me where it cuts out or give me a screenshot of their screen so I could possibly fix it? ;; I wonder if its okay for the mod to change it if it doesnt fit for everyone Also, thank you to everyone who said congrats to me! I woke up in the morning with 13 congrats and mentions xD"
SchoolIdolFestival,3cecn6,jawseex,3,Tue Jul 7 13:19:39 2015 UTC,"Anyone with any cut out banner, does this perhaps look better?"

SchoolIdolFestival,3cecn6,kayochin,2,Tue Jul 7 15:20:58 2015 UTC,Thank you for the confirmation! It should be fine for screens with 1200x_ resolutions or screens close to it

SchoolIdolFestival,3cecn6,Wiizel1337,13,Wed Jul 8 14:26:46 2015 UTC,"What if the subreddit css was changed to allow the banner to scale to the display size such that the entire banner is always displayed?    #header {      background-size: 100% auto;   }     This way the entire width of the banner can be used, instead of currently having a large empty space to the right size of the girls; Visitors with smaller display sizes will see more of the image vertically, instead of being cut off horizontally. For an example, visit our neighbours r/lovelive, you can see that a smaller screen will show more of the girls' bodies but all 9 remain on screen."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cecn6,makoharurins,4,Tue Jul 7 16:26:45 2015 UTC,This would definitely be preferable to having a larger space/trying to accommodate for everyone.
SchoolIdolFestival,3cecn6,loneliestbaby,3,Tue Jul 7 18:32:11 2015 UTC,"Simply adding this to the code would cause the background height to change, and thus leave random white space below the image. (I just tried it.) I have a feeling it's because /r/LoveLive's banner is taller than the space it needs to be viewed in, so that the viewing area would extend downward.  We would need a cleanly cropped version with all the girls but little to no bleed space to the right, but with something below it (like more of the image extending below 200px) which would require a good bit of redesigning. But even then I'm not quite sure how it would work without some other tweaks to the CSS. I could try and tweak things a bit but I can't promise this would work. However, if /u/irelinae would like to do that with this same design then I'd definitely be willing to try and get the code to work.  I'm considering a style switcher instead so we can have a more condensed banner for those who prefer that, or a scalable banner in addition to the current one... (There are some users who would probably prefer a banner like this too.) It's just a matter of freeing space to create a link in the sidebar for that, since right now we literally don't even have enough remaining characters (yes there is a limit) to write ""http://reddit.com"". I'm talking to the other mods about possibly moving some of our sidebar to a wiki page, but I don't have wiki permissions. As far as the CSS for switching styles goes, I already figured that out on a test subreddit, so that's not an issue... It's just a matter of having space to implement the change in the sidebar, so people can switch without hassle.  Anyway right now the code you provided above on its own won't work with the current banner's dimensions and layout. If tweaks can be made to the banner then it's possible it could work out."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cecn6,IllusionaryRose,3,Wed Jul 8 04:24:58 2015 UTC,I'm more than willing to cooperate and I can tweak the banner or remake it to what it was again since I do have the pdn file with everything placed in it. I can possibly use the same dimensions as Love Live's banner if needed.
SchoolIdolFestival,3cecn6,loneliestbaby,2,Wed Jul 8 14:12:24 2015 UTC,"Of course you're right, it's not a one line solution. Either the CSS needs more modifications or the banner has to be remade with new dimensions. The alternate style sounds like a good solution too. Whatever you decide, I'm sure the subreddit will keep looking better and better, the new banner is very refreshing already. Edit: Just wanted to add thank you for taking the time to type out such a detailed response, and for holding the banner contest."
SchoolIdolFestival,3cecn6,Kotofluff,11,Wed Jul 8 08:23:18 2015 UTC,"looks beautiful but I can't help but mourn for Nozomi, Kotori, and Honkers being cut off :')"
SchoolIdolFestival,3cecn6,sunflowering,3,Tue Jul 7 06:49:04 2015 UTC,I mourn for them too ;; really sorry about that but I made a new banner decreasing the size and shifting them over a bit. Does that perhaps work better for you?

SchoolIdolFestival,3ce8ah,UmiLife,2,Tue Jul 7 10:38:37 2015 UTC,"--I've been lurking for quite a while --I think December-ish?--, and this might have been the pinnacle of my accounts creation to this subreddit!  I've been playing for roughly 6 or 7 months(?) [My first event SR is the Hug Attack SR Nozomi card, which I adore ♥]  17 of my SRs are event SRs which I do love them all, however my goal was to roll my favorite set from my favorite two idols, the Spring Hanayo and Rin (because they look are so perfect for each other!) Like, their Idolized forms (which is a dream goal to get both! the art of them is just amazing.)  I recall (when I was still new!) trying to roll for the November UR for Hanayo, where she is holding her bowl of rice ♥! Back then, I wasn't aware of the guaranteed SR, and had enough to roll 3 10+1's. My first and second roll gave me 11 rares (again, back then, rares to me were like super rare cards and I didn't really understand the game to the extent that I do now), and my third roll gave me a Honoka SR. It wasn't until about a week after I had rolled that my friend (the one who got me into LLSIF) told me that after each release of a new UR, there is a guaranteed SR period. I told him the results of my rolls and she told me to straight up restart. I was very upset upon this realization, however to receive an SR(I thought that receiving one SR out of three 10+1's was pretty good), I decided to keep on going with the account to one day reunite my Hanayo and Rin together.  Months later, I rack up more and more loveca to take my chances at a UR of my favorite two idols. Eventually, my total 10+1's total up to around 8 or 9 10+1's. Note: I am a complete free to play player. Within all of those rolls in total, I received ONE Rin and ONE Hanayo SR outside of event cards, which was a slap to the face, and a blessing (HANAYO AND RIN CARDS!). Funny enough, each of the SR rolls have given me at most, 2 SRs. (Gosh, atleast bless me with more Hanayo or Rins ><!)  My main account is currently rank 104, and --no joke,-- during the whole promotional Nozomi giveout, my phone decided to die on me. I missed out on a free Vegas Nozomi, like come on, who wouldn't want that card? Currently, I live away in college so I couldn't until recently, get a new phone, missing out on a bunch of event SRs and possible rolls for Rin/Hanayo rolls! I was pretty devastated and wanted to quit, but being Rank 104, took alot of time.  When I did eventually was blessed by RNGods for a UR, it was a UR for my least favorite idol. It was the February Ver. UR for Nico. That was the lowest point of my LLSIF career. I was happy that it was a UR, but not of my favorite girls.  So, I feel like that account literally, has the Promotional Nozomi I missed out on, AND not only that, you have two of THE best cards in the game (in my opinion).  I'm sorry of this is derailing, or a bit too much, it just sums up a little bit of what I've been through of my LLSIF life ><."

So here's my entry (sorry if my english is not that good):  I first started SIF when someone posted a screenshot of the game on facebook. That time, I was looking for a rhythm game (because I love rhythm games xD) so why not give it a try? That's how I started playing SIF~  When I started playing, the current event was ""Gather, everyone! Sweet Holiday Kotori's Sweets"". I only played for 4~5 months coz' my luck sucked (I was URless back then) and my device can't handle the game anymore because it took to much space. So I stopped playing, until I got a new device! (which was bought on may). That's a long time before I got back on SIF xD  I tried to reroll acounts on EN, but it seems it only gives me Inital URs (which sucks coz' I don't like initials except for Maki). So, I stopped EN for a while and tried to play JP ver. I tried to reroll accounts on JP too, and it gave me good results.  As of now, I don't have an account on EN so maybe I'll try my luck here and see :3 That's all, thanks!  EDIT: Oh and btw, my favorite girl is Umi :D"
SchoolIdolFestival,3ce8ah,LuluAgridulce,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:22:09 2015 UTC,"Good luck to the participants!  I love the spring set and my luck is absolutely terrible. It's an ongoing joke within my group of gaming friends that I have the worst luck (I'll fail 99% success rate rolls consistently in games) and just as this would suggest, I never got a UR myself. The only time I got a UR is when I saved up 50 gems and gave the phone to my friend (the luckiest one in the group) and he rolled a UR + 3 SR...   Anyway, I put my heart and soul into this account especially when trying to tier for the last Umi event only to be 40 ranks short of T1 (after the game crashed and lost me points)."
SchoolIdolFestival,3ce8ah,sayuriririn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:33:22 2015 UTC,"I've been playing the english version of love live! since it first got released and I haven't been able to scout a single UR. Every time I did a 10 scout, I would get all rares. I saved up 170 gems a few weeks ago and decided to try and solo scout all my gems on the lily white scouting box in hopes of UR waitress Umi because it's my favourite card in the game and all I got was rares ;; I've pretty much given up scouting and will just focus on getting event SRs from now on! It would be very nice to be considered for this account and I wish luck to everyone else trying for it!! (つ∀－)"

SchoolIdolFestival,3ce8ah,Nanami-sama,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:23:11 2015 UTC,"Oh my gosh, I'd like to enter, if that's okay! I don't consider my luck too bad but I do prefer to take care of two accounts on each server at a time... because... I'm crazy...  I've been playing since summer of last year. I wanted to play since the JP version came out, but I hadn't been up to date in technology and never got the chance. I had no luck in EN, like, at all, so I moved to JP. The planets aligned and I was blessed with 4 URs! However, I traded the account away for an EN account with 2 URs since I wanted to start again at a comfortably high rank (and I prefer EN over JP).  When it comes to bad luck, I've never scouted a UR on EN before, except from when I first started playing and got the Yukata Kotori via soloyolo. My 10+1s have always resulted in 1 SR, and only one has ended up with my favourite girl. It's shameful to admit I've spent over $200 on this game and I still don't have any cards I really care much for.  I am really in love with this game, obviously. I have an internal clock that lets me know when my LP is fully restored. Since the spring RinPana set is one of my absolute favourites, I can see myself abandoning my current main for this one once I get it to a higher rank.  I'm sorry, I'm really bad with words! And this is probably unnecessarily long since I tend to do that. But TL;DR, School Idol Festival is really important to me, and I treat each of my accounts like my babies. But a permanent main account will save me a lot of stress... which I'm embarrassed to admit a game causes me. But hey, it makes me happy in the end! ;v;"
SchoolIdolFestival,3ce8ah,KotoriPaca,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:25:34 2015 UTC,"Oh my gosh, I don't even care if I win or not, let me rant about my luck really fast. So I've been playing since November, right. I've done 3 10 + 1 draws and literally 2 of the times I got all rares, and one time I got just one SR, and it was an initial, so like I was very much salty with my game, considering for that one, I had spent my own money on the account. Okay, but then I won a giveaway, but the transfer code was lost somehow or something. Like not to sound like a completely baby, but I, like come on! Something! I mean my friends been playing for a month and has 4 UR already, and I've only scouted one once on a reroll account that I completely ended up losing, (sadly.) But yeah, let's just say I'm completely cursed by this game and I don't think I'll ever be lucky with it. I'm pretty sure KLAB just sits and plots evilly against me, to be perfectly honest. I have no idea HOW you were so lucky, but like teach me your ways please. Anyways, I would take care of this account because it's completely precious and amazing, it's kind of hard not to want it, if I had it, I wouldn't give it away, like ever.

I have been playing the game since the last nico score match or the kotori school idol diary whichever  is older so it is about a year and two monthes  My luck is terrible really really terrible TAT when I did my first 10+1 scout I got 1 SR only and it was cyber Nontan it looked like a R more than a SR and it only recovered LP, and after 3 monthes of playing the JP ver of the game I finally gained a UR and it was Kayo-chin.. I like her but my main EN account also has Kayo-chin as main ,I feel kayo-chin is stalking me XD and my EN account got deleted once while changing my device, it had 1 SR and I was happy with it. I am really a poor player LOL ,KLAB is one evil company XD. so I started a new acc and it had Rs only. I reached rank 40 and then downloaded the game on my cousin's device, it was a starter and I gained 1 UR and 2 SRs, it was my luckiest day ever. I transferred this acc to my device and kept it as my main so I completely restarted the game again.  I would love to have the account because of all what I have written up there XD and also because of this↓   because of the URs: I love Rin's personality and I would love to keep hearing nya all over the place \ ( = ^ △ ^ = ) / kittens are my life.. also I would love to have a UR pairing, I don't mind having this kayo-chin because it is her cutest unidolized UR. and for Nico I love the way she holds the card acting like nozomi. and Nozomi's initial isn't bad after all it really shows her personality. also looking at other attributes so, RIP Cool team XD but it is ok  because of SRs: Umi is the best girl so that idolized SR OMG GIVE IT TO MEEEE also nontan is 2nd best and eli's 3rd best so all these SRs C'mon!  because of the rank: I don't really play EN out of events but with this rank I totally would! I love all the songs above rank 50 = ☆_☆ = GO NICORINPANA also I am a Lily white fan so you know what that means! Lily white all day XD    Goodluck to everyone!

I am 27 years old and I am quite the stressed student that plays SIF during the pauses from study. I am playing since August 2014. :°D One day my youngest brother (10 y/o)  surprised me while I was playing and since that moment he showed a lot of interest in the game and especially in Nico. He started to like her and all of her cards. We managed to install another SIF account on his small phone and it worked, but he finally became quite depressed because the game never let him scout a Nico SR.  He is small but he is really good with the game (he can FC expert songs easily) so as a big sister I think he would be really happy to have an account with a Nico UR  and an SR Nico in a wedding dress (I guess he will explode). Also in this account there is the Hanayo UR of my dreams and since on my main account I am quite unlucky too with scoutings I would love to caress her card every few days. XD  That's all, it was fun to tell you me and my brother's story. We sound like two crazy people. XD Thank you for the opportunity! Bye!"

I've been playing since January~ My luck is crappy on EN bbbb.. spent about $100 on my account and still don't have much of anything, so it's really disappointing.

I wouldn't say that my luck is 'rotten' but I'm sure as hell aren't really lucky. I do have a UR on my temporary main account but... well I got it when I was on rank 90? Sometimes I have the feeling my sister is sucking away all my luck since she gets SR cards from scouting ticket and UR's all the time while I'm kind of stuck with my rares. She started to play 3 months after me and already has more SR and UR cards than me and I can't help to feel really, really unlucky- (´；ω；`) okay enough ranting about my sister. it's not like she could do something about it. I really love this account since it has my favourite UR Hanayo! My best girl is Pana and I tried to scout her to no avail. It just left me with 0 loveca and a bunch of R cards and I think one old SR. And well I just really love the wedding set as well and you even have two of them idolized ;w;"" + the fairytail set Nozomi ;A; I'm dreaming about to idolize her one day because it's such a beautiful card!

I've been playing LLISF for a few months now(since brave maiden umi event match). While I believe my luck surely is not as terrible as many others here, it is slowly deteriorating haha. When I first began playing and scouted I got a SR from a ticket then did a 10+1 later for 3 more SR! After realizing how lucky those pulls were I started to get into LLISF some more that's when the cosmic forces must've taken my luck, for ever since then my only option of SR is by guaranteed. If I were to obtain this account it would help me by 1 giving me hopefully a ""luck reset"" and 2 prevent me from going to the 100+ UR less club.

I quit after a while, as I never even got an SR... I started playing again in May, and then proceeded to lose that account when someone deleted the game and I was too much of an idiot to save the code... I joined Reddit near this time, and have been having fun ever since! Someone even gave me a code to restart my 7SR account with 2SR O A O My Japanese account is doing well, with 2UR even though it is ftp, but my EN account is... UR less after 80 dollars~ I do manage to get more than one SR in scouts though, so my luck really isn't that bad.   If I got the account, I really would use it.

SchoolIdolFestival,3ce8ah,vivisuke,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:28:57 2015 UTC,"Oh man I don't usually apply to giveaways but I have been playing for almost 8 months and have still not gotten any of my best girls and this account has my three biggest faves. So a little backstory, I've been playing since late December. I actually started before I had even watched the anime, fell in love with the game, then went back to watch everything. Fell in love even more (idol hell is an amazing and terrible place).  So in regards to bad luck... Nozomi and Nico are my best girls (followed by Hanayo). Since I joined right before the New Years Nico event, I had to spend a lot of my loveca just to get the basic card. When the Nozomi event rolled around right after, I worked really hard and spent a lot of loveca - woke up late about 15 minutes before the event ended and missed out on T2 by about 150 points. I have spent quite a bit of money on the game but I have only gotten 1 Nozomi SR and no Nico SRs outside of events. (I missed the Hanayo event because it was my last semester in Uni and I was taking a bunch of courses to be able to finish). I'm over Rank 100 and only have one UR, initial Umi. Shoot as far as luck goes, even outside of the game I spent money on figure gacha for Love Live and got Honkers. I can't get Nico, Nozomi or Hanayo to save my life. I love this game so much and enjoy playing it so much, but I am really getting discouraged at my inability to draw my faves. ;A;  I would love to take care of this account because it has my favorite Nico cards - the UR AND idolized wedding Nico (omg precious baby she looks soooo cute!!). It also has unidolized wedding Nozomi which is my favorite Nozomi card and initial Nozomi - and unlike most people, I adore that card to bits and I would be thrilled to get it even once. And then you have Hanayo too, which is one of my other faves because she reminds me of myself - because we both love food too much, especially rice! (Her voice is so cute and her seiyuu is adorable too.)  Honestly, I would love to have this account because I would really treasure the cards because it's basically my dream account - you have all of the cards I've oogled at, longed for, and prayed would be in my 10+1s but never had the fortune of getting. I've never posted a luck post because of all my 10+1s (and I've had many), I only ever got 1SR+10R except one time I got 2SR+9R. The only UR I have was a soloyolo I paid IRL money for (and it took a few of those to get that, and it was because of limited time scouting with Nozomi but I didn't even get one from that box). So I would love to have an account with my faves so I could make it my main, build on it and hopefully get more awesome cards to go with the ones already on it - and finally tier in some of the events I've been anticipating for months.  No matter who you decide to give it to I'm sure it will be someone who deserves it. Thank you for your generosity because it's a really amazing account. I hope you enjoyed your trip to Japan (I will be going there soon myself!) and good luck on your second job! :)"

That spring Rin is basically my dream UR (and ofc best girl) and I've been on the hunt desperately looking through all the threads to find it to no avail (I made wayy too many threads and posts trying to get it lmao). I recently bought myself a $50 google play gift card for my JP but turns out I can't use an english gift card for JP (and I already gave away my EN to my friend) so this account would be absolutely PERFECT for me (this was my attempt at breaking out of being a F2P player). I absolutely love SIF it's ruining my life. My siblings and my parents always mock me by imitating me tapping on the screen haha! It's essentially my dream account and I would be over the moon to take care of it and treasure it. 50 dollars is a lot in my book and many other's, especially considering I'm a poor college student so I would really love to spend it on an EN account I care about and love instead of letting the $50 go to waste.

I would have never buy any love gems (i want to but unfortunately, i am financially impaired), however, i will always aim for T1 in any event, and would never waste any LP by not playing for too long"
SchoolIdolFestival,3ce8ah,DearAny,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:06:36 2015 UTC,"i'd like to enter, if that's okay! i've been playing ensif for a few months now (maybe five), and jpsif a month less. i feel as if my luck is terrible since i've only solo-rolled the SRs i have on my ensif main. my friend has scouted me three URs before, but i never have scouted one myself. (i've done about five 10+1 scouts, on several accounts, and i've only gotten one SR out of them) i would take care of this account dearly, since one of my favourite sets is on it, the march set. sadly, i joined right when the march set was released and i had no idea how to play the game at the time, so i missed out. thank you for hosting and good luck to everyone entering!"
SchoolIdolFestival,3ce8ah,Nishigayno,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:12:25 2015 UTC,"<3 I would love this! My luck is horrible.. I scout only a SR Every month.. (I have been playing for like.. 3/4 of a year.) I love the Spring Set and you have it! I would like this account because  *With your teams, it's easy to get event SRs! I always try to T2 for events but seemliness I always get kicked out! I should tell you I don't like playing on because the last time I scouted a SR for myself on the EN Version was 3-4 months ago  *If u look in my ""Summited"" Section you will see that I have no Luck posts. Why you may ask? Because I am so unlucky and when I get SRs, they are always on rerolls. Again, As I said earlier my luck is revolting. If I got an SR I had before, I WOULD SCREAM BECAUSE ITS SO UNEXPECTED!  *About Luck and Event SRs, You already know my luck is terrifyingly sad. Plus since my luck is bad and your teams are amazing, I can easily get Event Cards and not cry on my rares! Also even If I was lucky, your account probably won't achieve it because of all the AMAZING CARDS YOU HAVE!  *Hanayo is my favorite! I have to Ship HanayoxMaki! But a lot do MAKIxNICO and some do RINxMAKI. *This is a spolier if you didnt watch the anime. When Hanayo found Maki's journal where she found out that Maki wrote a lot of songs.  After she goes to her house, Maki didn't have friends (for some reason) until she met Hanayo <3 (Basically Her First Friend! I find it cute) When Hanayo found the music journal, she started looking in the book to find songs.. Then she goes to Maki's House. Then her mother is suprised that someone was looking for Maki! She told her to come in the thats basically when they started talking. (P.S Her house is a mansion!)  *Hanayo's voice is amazing! Yes it is high pitched but doesn't ""PrintTemps"" sound amazing with her? Her duets with Kotori have a beautiful tones, as well as her solos! (Nawatobi and Kodoku No Heaven)  *Hanayo kinda reminds me of myself.. when I get scared. She is so cute and she says she isn't (which makes me cry). Her love for Rice is stunning! She loves food and when you look on the LOVE LIVE WIKI it says she has No ""Least"" favorite food!  *I hope you pick me but good luck to everyone else! I hope you enjoyed your trip!"

SchoolIdolFestival,3ccafo,HPxGunshot,2,Mon Jul 6 21:41:08 2015 UTC,I play mine at my desk.  My cat tends to not jump onto the top so for the most part I'm completely safe but sometimes he just rubs against my arms and blocks the view of the entire game.
SchoolIdolFestival,3ccafo,Marith_,2,Mon Jul 6 21:59:41 2015 UTC,My cat only just wants to sit on my lap. Sometimes rubbing up against my phone but overall not too bad as long as she has a spot to sit

Whenever I start playing, my cat decides it's a good time to climb onto my lap. And since I play with earphones on, she also decides that's her favorite toy. I have to play and twist my body in the weirdest ways so she won't reach the cord (it's the third one already)  Also, if I start playing when she's not next to me, she magically appears. Trust me, they know."

The file, if renamed, allows you to basically start a new profile and you can do this as many times as you want (basically how rerolling on bluestacks works)"
SchoolIdolFestival,3cebwv,GL1TCH3D,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:39:21 2015 UTC,"as far as I know you can't do that on iOS, you would need 2 iOS devices to use both. You can do it that hard way, switching it in 1 device but I wouldn't recommend it. The only way is on Android/Bluestacks I think, since you can stack as much accounts there just by renaming the GameEngineActivity.xml!"

SchoolIdolFestival,3cebwv,CrazeeeSkyhopper,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:43:14 2015 UTC,Why just not to use transfer codes on one device?
SchoolIdolFestival,3cebwv,CrazeeeSkyhopper,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:48:23 2015 UTC,I'm afraid I'll lose my main account by accident XD

SchoolIdolFestival,3cebwv,EnecoKamex,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:16:09 2015 UTC,I guess I can keep the new transfer code just in case it does die! Or something haha..having two accounts is a lot of work o_o

SchoolIdolFestival,3cdnq3,RagingAlien,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:32:26 2015 UTC,I am absolutely confused. 2 scouts give you 10 now?

SchoolIdolFestival,3cdnq3,killerjamesbond,2,Tue Jul 7 03:52:44 2015 UTC,"Person has 40 pts remaining, but the minimum for a multi-""Scout Again"" is 200 pts since 2 pulls is 200 pts. :)"
