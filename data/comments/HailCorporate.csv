I'd think if there were money behind this, the plug would have been pulled by now.  It does sound like he's got some kind of personal investment in it though, so maybe he's in the industry or something.  You can never tell.  I doubt it's some kind of paid shill account though."

HailCorporate,3e1jnr,lichtmlm,22,Tue Jul 21 12:48:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that's just one of his posts-strings. Every single time he posts it seems to be a strident pro-copyright post. Every. Single. Time. Literally all of his posts are purely and simply advocating for the financial interests of a particular industry. I mean, just read the next couple of pages of post. They are seriously strange. Now, it could conceivably as well be some random crazy person, perhaps one who works for the MPAA or something, who just has a really unhealthy and disturbing personal obsession about this kind of stuff. But that would be one seriously unbalanced and obsessive individual. And either way, regardless of who or what is behind this account, it's unarguably some kind of an amateurish attempt at an extremely blatant corporate propaganda account, and thus pretty fucking on-topic for this sub."
HailCorporate,3e1jnr,TheBrainSlug,6,Tue Jul 21 13:36:18 2015 UTC,"I think you're holding onto some common misconceptions about copyright. And as a disclaimer, I work with copyright owners, but many of the owners I work with are independent artists, photographers, businesses, etc., so it irks me when people automatically assume pro-copyright = pro=corporations.  Copyright is not simply about the financial interests of a particular industry. There's a variety of industries that rely on copyright, including film, music, software, tech, visual arts, and journalism and media. Large corporations rely on it, but so do independent artists, and, depending on the industry, some have way more independent artists. For instance, if you look at photography, most photographers work freelance, as their own independent business, and make a living by licensing their images for others to use. Ironically, it's large corporations like Google and Microsoft, whose search engines now frame and in-line link full-size images, who are doing the most harm to independent photographers, because it takes traffic away from the photographers who created the image, while reinforcing the idea that you never need to license images. So if you want to argue against copyright in this case, you're really taking the strong corporate side, because you're arguing for a large corporation's ability to monetize a small business's work while taking away from their business.  Just to be clear, I'm not defending this user; I'm simply pointing out that this user doesn't deserve to be highlighted in /r/hailcorporate just because he's stridently pro-copyright. He may not be going about it the best way, but for all you know he could be an independent artist whose been unable to recoup the investments in his work while seeing his work getting shared online. I'd probably be annoyed too if I saw people sharing my work and Internet platforms monetizing my work, all while I don't see any money coming in. There's large corporate interests that favor strong copyright laws and there's large corporate interests that favor weakening copyright laws. And there's independent businesses, creators, consumers, and others on both sides of the spectrum as well."
HailCorporate,3e1jnr,lichtmlm,5,Tue Jul 21 14:23:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah well, I already very clearly said that he could just be some crazy dude with a wierd personal obsession (which is all you seem to be arguing, e.g. your disgruntled artist example), but that even if this was the case he is still blatantly devoting his account to the purpose of propagandising on behalf of a particular industry, and thus is entirely eligable for inclusion in this subreddit. Your other points all relate to the various pros and cons of the viewpoint he repeatedly expresses. But these of are of course neither here nor there: e.g. Coke might actually be really awesome, but even so if you have an account that spends all day and night shilling for Coke then you are gonna get called out for it eventually, and rightfully so."
HailCorporate,3e1jnr,TheBrainSlug,2,Tue Jul 21 14:33:51 2015 UTC,"My points are that he's advocating for a viewpoint regarding a law not an industry.  That the law helps a particular industry has absolutely nothing to do with hailing a particular corporation, product, or company.  You can just as easily suggest that someone who blatantly posts about how content should be free is propagandizing on behalf of large technology companies that monetize said content rather than for ""democratizing"" culture. Or that someone who ardently supports the First Amendment is propagandizing on behalf of Conde Nast or News Corp rather than an individual right of expression.  Again, I'm in no way suggesting that his viewpoint is good or bad, I'm just trying to illustrate and ameliorate a very clear bias that assumes strong views in support of copyright protection automatically equal support for a particular industry. It just means support for a perceived intellectual property right, nothing more nothing less."
HailCorporate,3e1jnr,lichtmlm,2,Tue Jul 21 14:47:01 2015 UTC,"My points are that he's advocating for a viewpoint regarding a law not an industry     Read his posts. He's not arguing points of law.     That the law helps a particular industry has absolutely nothing to do with hailing a particular corporation, production, or company.     But that particular legal framework supports particular industries. Industries made up of both (0.1%) small struggling artists and (99.9%) monolithic, rent-seeking multi-billion dollar corporate behemoths, who deny both impoverished aids sufferers access to life saving drugs and impoverished students access to research papers, and many other things besides. Not one particular company, for sure, but definitely particular industries with mindbogglingly gigantic advertising and lobbying budgets at their disposal. So pretty on topic huh?      You can just as easily suggest that someone who blatantly posts about how content should be free is propagandizing on behalf of large technology companies that monetize said content.      Are you fucking serious? You are seriously one of these dudes who argues that Google should have to pay you for linking to your page, and pay you twice for putting a thumbnail in the image search link? Strange that you don't just use robots.txt to tell Google et al to leave you the hell alone! They'd be happy to if you asked. Bet you'd start crying real fast if some day they did without you asking them. No one is propagandising as you suggest. No industry is advocating for this. There is some grass-roots activism (e.g. pirate parties and such, maybe the odd open source software activist) but that really and truly is it. The tech companies you seem keen to demonise want more than anything to do business with the MAFIAA et al (since they are absolutely drooling over the prospect of an itunes-style 30% distribution cut), and utterly abhor the idea of any kind of conflict with them. More's the pity, since they are only too ready to do drastic damage to the public's rights and capacities regarding access to information both in their eagerness to keep IP companies happy and in their jostling for position for control over public access to information (particularly legacy information, see e.g. Google books) in a future of never-ending copyright terms.    Oh, for fucks sake. I really did not want to have to engage in this discussion. It's frankly just off-topic. The fact remains, even if you were somehow 100% on point with everything you've said, OP's post would remain perfectly on-topic for this sub. The real point we should focus on here is that the account OP draws attention to is an utterly blatant and obvious shill account. You seem to agree philosophically with some of that shilling. Well, that's fine, but for the purposes of this subreddit it really and truly is neither here nor there."

First, do you have any source to back up these statistics? Second, you're confusing copyright and patents. Which just goes to show that there's more than one industry that relies on intellectual property and more than one mechanism for going about it.   Are you fucking serious? You are seriously one of these dudes who argues that Google should have to pay you for linking to your page, and pay you twice for putting a thumbnail in the image search link?   You seem to be blatantly advocating on behalf of Google. Maybe there should be a post highlighting you on /r/hailcorporate. Just to make another point though, I never said anything about thumbnails. The courts have generally held this to be fair use in Kelly v. Arriba Soft and Perfect 10 v. Google. I very specifically said full-size images. It used to be quite easy to find the source of an image. A thumbnail could be helpful in that respect because it both helped consumers in finding images and helped visual artists by directing users to those artists. The new interface for image search though now both provides a thumbnail, and embeds the high definition image such that there's no reason to ever find the source image.

Not once have I demonized tech companies. The user highlighted in this post has demonized tech companies. The entire point of my original post was that bashing a company is not the same as advertising for a company. Additionally though, there's so much misinformation here, and you're so clearly biased in favor of supporting tech companies that I don't think it's worth the time to engage you any more. You've shown your true colors and are clearly as angry about copyright protection as the user highlighted in this post is about lack of copyright protection. You've pretty much illustrated my point to a t."

They are both, in part, messed up in this whole intellectual property rent-seeking fiasco, so I am conflating them. And fair enough, too.     You seem to be blatantly advocating on behalf of Google.     Honestly, I spend about half my time on this website advocating against Google and explaining in gory detail how dangerous companies like Google are (e.g. from earlier today). My reference to Google was what you call an ""example"".      There's so much misinformation here, and you're so clearly biased     My thoughts also. I'm pretty sure I'm not the one peddling an ideology here, though. Like I said, I really did not want  to get dragged off on this tangent, but you just kept insisting. The main point, once again, is that OP was drawing attention to an obvious and blatant shill account, and that it is well within the scope of this sub to do that.     Anyhow, I am tired and have to get up early (2 am here!). So the only other thing I'm gonna say is keep on trippin', you crazy ideologue you. Shine on, you crazy diamond!"

HailCorporate,3e1jnr,Esco91,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:52:09 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but my point is that this is not an advertisement. Just because you support copyright protection does not mean you are advertising for a particular industry, company, or anything else any more than supporting freedom of religion supports the Catholic Church. At the end of the day, you may simply be advocating for your own rights.   Again, I made a disclaimer that I do work with copyright owners because so much of the prevailing bias is harmful to them. Many of these copyright owners work completely independently and don't give a crap about corporations. Ironically many of them dislike large corporations in general. Many of them are simply trying to make a living selling and licensing their works in the online marketplace and think large corporations like Google are stealing their content. Whatever the merits of their viewpoint, my point is that having that viewpoint does not make you a corporate shill just because your interests happen to line up with a corporation's interests."
HailCorporate,3e1jnr,lichtmlm,3,Tue Jul 21 15:58:55 2015 UTC,"You appear to know a lot more about copyright than me - I don't work with copyright, I work with and have done my studies in Online Marketing, particularly with a political aspect.

HailCorporate,3e1jnr,Esco91,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:20 2015 UTC,"Of course, and I do understand what you're saying. But again, my point is that his actions and intentions merely suggest voicing a strong, somewhat obnoxious support for copyright protection and that should not be conflated with corporate shilling. Just because that viewpoint may be held by a large corporation does not mean that he is advertising for that corporation. It's like saying that you're a corporate shill because you voice strong support for H1B visas. Just because a corporation that sponsors a lot of foreign works supports H1B visas and benefits from those visas doesn't mean that you're advertising for that corporation by also supporting the visa."
