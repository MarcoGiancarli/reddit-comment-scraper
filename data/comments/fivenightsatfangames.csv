fivenightsatfangames,3c3g55,DespondentDynast,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:41:01 2015 UTC,"Alternate reality game:       An alternate reality game or augmented reality game (ARG) is an interactive networked narrative that uses the real world as a platform and uses transmedia storytelling to deliver a story that may be altered by players' ideas or actions.  The form is defined by intense player involvement with a story that takes place in real time and evolves according to players' responses. Subsequently, it is shaped by characters that are actively controlled by the game's designers, as opposed to being controlled by artificial intelligence as in a computer or console video game. Players interact directly with characters in the game, solve plot-based challenges and puzzles, and collaborate as a community to analyze the story and coordinate real-life and online activities. ARGs generally use multimedia, such as telephones, email and mail but rely on the Internet as the central binding medium.  ARGs are growing in popularity, with new games appearing regularly and an increasing amount of experimentation with new models and subgenres. They tend to be free to play, with costs absorbed either through supporting products (e.g. collectible puzzle cards fund Perplex City) or through promotional relationships with existing products (for example, I Love Bees was a promotion for Halo 2, and the Lost Experience and Find 815 promoted the television show Lost). However, pay-to-play models are not unheard of.

fivenightsatfangames,3beugn,Risemack,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:32:01 2015 UTC,"If you want modelers, you might want to tell what your game is about, or show your game making abilities. People will offer their talents when they see a project they want to be made."

fivenightsatfangames,3bczc4,Peacemaker250,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:30:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I noticed :)   He's a person, not an animatronic, because I wanted to try to make my game a little bit more unique I suppose. The only problem I thought this might cause is that criminals wouldn't normally stare at an enemy for 30 seconds before trying to kill them, they'd most likely do it immediately. I thought of a solution though, so I hid it in the game somewhere :P"

fivenightsatfangames,3bc9mq,doaler4,4,Sat Jun 27 21:14:15 2015 UTC,"its either for attention so they can magically feel motivated again and continue making it (a.k.a. lie to the people so they shower you in unnecessary support) or they genuinely feel that they have no proper driving force behind its production and just give up (which tbh can be changed by support from the people, go figure i guess)"
fivenightsatfangames,3bc9mq,squashue,2,Sat Jun 27 21:17:05 2015 UTC,..The Flumpty's thing is rather uncalled for. Not sure if you're referring to our project but c'mon now. If you're just gonna take shots without seeing actual in-game stuff..
fivenightsatfangames,3bc9mq,Nanori0,3,Sun Jun 28 01:14:24 2015 UTC,Your comments on some of the canceled games were uncalled for 100%
fivenightsatfangames,3bc9mq,SSB4Decoder,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:26:22 2015 UTC,"I know right? After Jonochrome cancelled the official OWAF, some people just stopped making the game and cancelled it, which if it was worked hard on makes cancelling feel a little overdramatic and silly. Here I am trying my best to make mine the best fangame it could be without cancellation as I know that people will be disappointed if I don't finish it. I think and remember that there was a massively hyped fangame and next thing that happens is that it flies off the face of earth like nothing happened."
fivenightsatfangames,3bc9mq,Advamco,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:55:34 2015 UTC,"Some fangames (more specifically OWaF, even stated by Jonochrome) were driven off of FNaF 4 hype, so when the hype died down, they felt unmotivated/ran out of ideas."
fivenightsatfangames,3bc9mq,angrygreenpigs,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:23:06 2015 UTC,"Whoa, no need to be mean to the kind developers of those cancelled games.  But other than that, I agree 100% that cancelling a game that you worked hard on is kinda silly."
