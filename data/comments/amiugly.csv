You have quite a nice figure.  Bottom line, I would date you in a heartbeat and your ex doesn't realize what they've lost.  I don't see you as overweight, but if you want to lose those 30 pounds you may want to cut back on the carbs and make sure to follow a daily exercise routine.  As far as makeup, my suggestion would be to go simple and accentuate your natural beauty. The recommendation to hit /r/MakeupAddiction is your best bet though.  They can tell you better than I (and do it without interjecting their personal preference). Don't stress it too much.  You are entering one of the greatest times of your life.  Be yourself, trust in your judgement and be confident in the fact that you are a beautiful young woman."

Imo get regular glasses or contacts none of those progressive sunglasses lenses. The frames don't look bad, but you could find I think you could find something that would make you look a lot hotter? You've got good skin and I dig your body, even with the little bit of extra weight. Nice smile and good teeth. The makeup is really heavy looking so I think you'd look better with either lighter application, more natural colors or no makeup at all. You've got nothing to worry about as a whole."

There's nothing that's going to motivate you more than going to school and meeting new people in a couple months so now's a great time to try to lose weight.  You could easily lose 10 pounds by then.  Just start counting your calories, have 1500 calories per day and never go over that.  And you're probably only going to get fatter in college like most people do.    Having said that, you're not exactly fat.  You look pretty good.  You look better without glasses so maybe get contacts too."

Your eyelids are really tall and they make you look permenantly sleepy to me. Makeup conceals the effect, which is good.   Your chin is a little bit bumpy.

It was taken shortly after a shower, it normally looks somewhat better (but still absolutely tragic).

amiugly,3e2ba8,nblack02,4,Tue Jul 21 14:25:40 2015 UTC,"Yo! You kinda look like you started chemo, but it's better than the hair in the before pics! Maybe you went a little too short haha, grow it out a little imo.  I think if you had stubble rather than goatee/mo it would look a lot better and you still wouldn't look like a 12 year old, but even going completely shaven would look good too I think.  The only other thing is the glasses, I just think the shape isn't right for your face.  The balding is unfortunate but it's not the end of the world.  You're a good looking guy, you just need to find what suits you."

Notice what you like about other people's clothing..get a sense of what you want..then, slowly start to try out different things.

amiugly,3e2ba8,smallsmallness,2,Tue Jul 21 13:45:03 2015 UTC,Starts hurting the back of my ear after a few hours of wearing them. Before moving to a different city I went back to the optician 10-15 times to have them readjusted to no avail.
amiugly,3e2ba8,Velocirater69,2,Tue Jul 21 14:27:23 2015 UTC,pro tip: you can adjust them yourself by using a hand dryer in any mens restroom to slightly adjust the plastic.   i'm sure you find similar glasses pretty easily. cheers!

amiugly,3e1pdm,MistressCelius,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:33:59 2015 UTC,"i think you look a lot better! but here are some tips I can give you on what you can improve:   first of all, if you want to help move along the process for improving your skin and etc. start having a daily routine for cleaning your face; remember to wash your face every morning and night, and if you can, buy a few face masks to try out! one that works wonders for acne prone skin and is super cheap is the Queen Helene Mint Julep masque, and another that I use is the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Mask. Both are great and I highly recommend them! also, try and exfoliate your skin at least once a week in order to freshen up your skin and get rid of any dry skin cells.  when it comes to makeup, if you don't want to risk breaking out or getting things in your pores, opt for mineral makeup.  it's light, it is less likely to get into your pores, and it works well for acne prone skin! (trust me, I have acne prone and sensitive skin and mineral makeup has been my savior for not breaking out)  I think your hair will look great after you grow it out (form what I can tell, it looks pretty healthy, just remember to trim the ends every 3 months or so in order to grow out your hair in a more healthy manner)  other than that, keep up the good work! I am glad to hear that you have a loving boyfriend, and it's great to see your progress as well as the effort you are putting in!"
amiugly,3e1pdm,kalliasolti28,2,Tue Jul 21 08:04:03 2015 UTC,Thanks!  I've been asking my friends who's a specialist in makeup but I haven't told her how prone I am to breaking out. I'll keep the mineral makeup in mind and ask her for her advice on what kinds to get.  I'll definitely look at the face masks too. Are the ones you mentioned natural?
amiugly,3e1pdm,kalliasolti28,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:09:24 2015 UTC,"I know the Aztec Indian Healing Clay is natural, but i'm not too sure about the Queen Helene one, I just know that it works wonders as i've used it before, and you can definitely feel a difference. If you do want other all natural masks though, I would recommend looking into The Body Shop face masks, they sell a tea tree oil mask and a seaweed clay mask as well.  and asking her advice is definitely a good idea! I use makeup from bareMinerals and i've come to love their products, but there are many great options out there for mineral makeup!"

It feels like this can be a gradual thing where after a few weeks I'll end up breaking out even worse. I'm so hesitant when it comes to that.  I think my friend's very familiar with bareMinerals, and it was all she could really rave on about. I dunno if she knows anymore, but I'll do more research. Thanks!"

amiugly,3e3y2k,mythical_legend,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:54:40 2015 UTC,Thanks man. What kind of style do you think would work best?
amiugly,3e3y2k,Tokemonbattle,2,Tue Jul 21 20:18:49 2015 UTC,"Idk where you live but in my country (Australia) the undercut is the look to have, you'll feel dorky for a day or two but once it's set in it looks fantastic, especially with a bit of stubble, and one you get sick of cutting it each fortnight, grow the top out into a man bun. Trust me, you're not like 10/10 amazing or anything but a new haircut would for sure get you more female/male interest. Good luck :)"
amiugly,3e3y2k,gargats,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:50:02 2015 UTC,cut your hair
amiugly,3e3y2k,ElSaborAsiatico,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:52:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unfortunately at first glance I thought ""moderately attractive woman."" Your hairstyle is simply not flattering so definitely get it cut, at least past your jawline. Otherwise you look fairly handsome. It's hard to tell from the camera perspective but you look like you have a large head in proportion to your body, so bulking up your physique some would provide balance. You are not ugly, but definitely do something about that hair."
amiugly,3e3y2k,ElSaborAsiatico,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:22:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm planning on cutting the hair. But I just don't know what would work best for me hairstyle wise
amiugly,3e3y2k,magagoo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:46:52 2015 UTC,"As /u/Tokemonbattle said, the undercut is probably the style of the moment, and I think with your strong chin and longish facial structure you could totally rock that. But if you're not comfortable going that far from where it is now, maybe some kind of feathered style would work for you."
amiugly,3e3y2k,tempoacco,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:06:43 2015 UTC,"Haircut - short on the sides and back (like, short. as in, a 2 clipper), longer on the front.  Body - eat better, lose weight, work out.  Your facial structure is good, man, and you're young. Get started now and you'll be a stud in a few years. Or don't get started and you'll still be a skinny long-haired nerd :)"
amiugly,3e3x2z,holy_wars,4,Tue Jul 21 19:36:09 2015 UTC,Yeah you need to cut your hair. No need to go short. Just not that long. Good looking face completely ruined by that haircut
amiugly,3e3x2z,Cookiebookie1,3,Tue Jul 21 19:37:36 2015 UTC,They're all correct - cut your hair dude. Really bad look that makes you look like you're stuck in the 80's. A modern haircut would be a huge improvement.
amiugly,3e3x2z,canucklepuck,2,Tue Jul 21 19:37:53 2015 UTC,Most guys are going to tell you to cut it.  A lot of girls will tell you to keep it.  It also won't help you in job interviews and stuff like that.  It depends on what matters to you.    Your real problem lookswise is your style.  That tshirt is too big.  And it looks like you might need to lose weight too.  Those are your bigger problems.

I urge you to reorient your perspective to respond more positively to short hair, because with your face and physique I think you'd look pretty damn handsome with a short cut.

amiugly,3e3x2z,ElSaborAsiatico,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:18:21 2015 UTC,"Well, you're posting in /r/amiugly so I'm assuming you're looking for advice on improving your appearance.  The core is - you might 'love this look' but to most people (girls, potential employers, friends, etc), your look is not good. Here's what I would suggest:   Seriously, listen to your friends that have your best interests at heart. Cut your hair. Look at pictures of guys that have similar facial structures to you and hair you like, and show them to a good barber. Learn to smile. I don't know what sort of weird smirk you're doing in both pictures, but go to the bathroom, look in the mirror, and practice your smile until you feel comfortable. Do it every day. Throw away all your oversized graphic T-shirts and get better-fitting more stylish clothes. Go to the gym. Work out."
amiugly,3e3rgo,Halber_Mensch,2,Tue Jul 21 18:58:07 2015 UTC,"You look mostly fine! Well proportioned features, good face shape, good posture, expressive eyes, and you look reasonably fit. The only negative factor is the bags/darkness underneath your eyes. Since you have a prominent brow to begin with, it throws a bit of shadow onto your eyes, and if the area underneath is also dark, it makes for a somewhat unhealthy appearance. It's not terrible by any means, but I'd look into some creams or serums to help with that."

I wouldn't try to get much skinnier but more muscular. Are you already doing strength training? If not I would recommend it to you.

Water fasting is a terrible idea, r/loseit has a lot of tips for weight loss. Also r/fitness if you want to bulk up.  Friends that tell you you'll never find anyone aren't real friends. Punch him in the face.  You need to gain some confidence, your expression is really reluctant and kinda off putting. Smile more.  There's nothing terrible or that can't be solved about you. You look like an average teenager, these are awkward years both with looks and confidence. Don't let bullying get you down, bullies latch onto emotionally vulnerable people, not onto ugly people. Good luck."

amiugly,3dz9jo,dinaaa,10,Mon Jul 20 21:38:33 2015 UTC,"For skin, you can fix it cheap. Check out /r/skincareaddiction as they have a huge amount of resources. Basically, change your pillow case every few days. Start washing your face daily (once after you wake up, Once before bed). Don't touch your face during the day. your hands touch everything and that is gross. Also, clearing up acne takes a long times (6 weeks - many months/years) so if you see no change, don't stop daily routine of washing. Keep doing it and eventually it will look a bit better. And don't forget about changing pillowcases!   Edit: all these people say you are super ugly, but I can't believe they are so harsh about it! Sure, you're no model but almost no one is. You have things that can be fixed. Your facial structure (except the overbite) is just fine. You just need a haircut, acne treatment, and braces. I'd say the braces should be your top priority. Anyways, you aren't as horrid as people are saying. Good luck"

Im not ugly but im not great looking in my opinion but what i did for the acne was pretty simple, all i did was wash my face with nothing but water every morning and dried it off with a clean towel. I started changing my bedsheets and pillowsheets and that helped clear me a ton.   As for the teeth i eventually got braces and the experience was not horrible just annoying. So whenever you can go, to the dentist. As for the hair you can either cut it and find a style/look you like or go to a profesional and tell them you want to keep it long and to style it or something.  My 2 cents from experience."

amiugly,3dz9jo,PurpleMurp,2,Tue Jul 21 02:49:32 2015 UTC,"I respect that, but I've seen some really ugly people on this subreddit, and you can't make them look hot with a haircut. That comment just seemed really damning, so I wanted to make sure OP understood he's not terminally unattractive."
amiugly,3dz9jo,tetsuoignition,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:08:17 2015 UTC,I can see that point.
amiugly,3dz9jo,ThoroughlyAgitated,-7,Tue Jul 21 15:39:40 2015 UTC,"I would love to see your mug.  A quick glance in to your Post history, and anime and Pokemon is what you find the most. Let play the odds here and roll the heavy majority that a CS major whose interests are Pokemon and Anime isnt cream of the crop in the physical appernce department either. I would wager you aren't that far away from the OP either  ""Extremely Ugly"", did you lose a few brain cells and forgot to learn basic etiquette? I know this is a bare all forum, but if anonymous mongoloids who probably aren't very good looking anyway start using the same type of obnoxious verbiage like you than what exactly is the difference between this  subreddit and the assholes who bully this kid  I understand that the whole mantra here is to be laissez-faire with the commentary but a little contextual understanding goes a long way. The kid obviously has insecurities, and is obviously not that physically attractive. So instead of just giving advice on how to improve; why is there is incessant need to associate potentially adverse labels and call him ""the ugliest guy on this subreddit"". Really if your imbecilic brain can come up with one positive remark on why you thought that had any relevance or significance I wont actually rip you a new one for not being able to destroy data structures, it is a weed out course for the morons who don't understand how to think fundamentally..   Here is a tip for the future, you want to be an asshole go the fk right ahead. When a kid who obviously deals with a lot on his plate and in his own words gets persecuted for how he looks; Lets try to take  it a peg down and understand that not every stupid thing that comes out of our mouth needs to be posted."

amiugly,3dz9jo,CharlieTwist,8,Tue Jul 21 06:50:23 2015 UTC,"Dude, you need a haircut. That's half your battle done.  Otherwise, you will grow into yourself. Your skin will clear with time."
amiugly,3dz9jo,Genrok,3,Mon Jul 20 19:10:05 2015 UTC,Guys can wear makeup now too. I wear it sometimes and I think a light coat could help you. Also maybe try to see if a dentist can help with your teeth positioning at all
amiugly,3dz9jo,tempaccountlolz,3,Mon Jul 20 21:30:30 2015 UTC,"I read your other comments and here's what I've got  Use skin care products   Don't keep your mouth open if your face is at rest - make sure it's closed. If it's open it just looks odd and would do for anyone   Try fixing your teeth w/ braces or whatever the dentist recommends   Get a haircut    In general try and find a style that shits you and stick with it. Half of being attractive is just the persona you put on the outside whether that be real or feigned. If you're u confident, feign confidence and that will be more attractive"
amiugly,3dz9jo,boredperzon,3,Mon Jul 20 21:41:43 2015 UTC,"in general guys, Could I ask you to specify each and every detail that you have an issue with, rather than just stating i'm ugly. this is more directed to the people who didn't."
amiugly,3dz9jo,Starylain,3,Mon Jul 20 22:08:55 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christmas. I feel bad for you man.. My acne used to be bad and it is clearing up now.  Invest money in treatment, it is so worth it. Everything in the world is do much better with clear skin."
amiugly,3dz9jo,arb10280,5,Tue Jul 21 01:10:48 2015 UTC,Maybe try getting some braces through the process too?
amiugly,3dz9jo,arb10280,2,Mon Jul 20 19:25:21 2015 UTC,Do something with teeth
amiugly,3dz9jo,Biteitliketysen,2,Mon Jul 20 20:43:26 2015 UTC,ugly but somewhat fixable

amiugly,3dz9jo,drinkit_or_wearit,2,Mon Jul 20 22:06:18 2015 UTC,"Just what everyone else said, acne will clear up, teeth can be fixed, haircut, better clothes"
amiugly,3dz9jo,drinkit_or_wearit,2,Mon Jul 20 22:32:05 2015 UTC,"Fix the teeth,  get a hair cut,  and get some accutane for the acne"
amiugly,3dz9jo,Dariaslike_,2,Tue Jul 21 00:36:11 2015 UTC,"Your features in general really aren't that bad. I know you already made a point of saying don't mention the hair, but some basic grooming or a different hair cut could do you wonders. As for your skin, there are some very simple and cheap options out there, I know personally that acne can be a pain. As for your teeth, I hope you can one day get treatment for your overbite, been down that path as well. But overall, you have reasonably attractive features, such as your eyes and eyebrows, that could really be accentuated by just taking some more time on your appearance."
amiugly,3dz9jo,KaliniaRose,2,Tue Jul 21 01:09:06 2015 UTC,"Def need some skin care. Don't worry about what others might think, get out there and go full on GIRLY about it. Try and buy anything you can. If you are poor (no shame there, I have been poor most my life) then do research online. Find something.   Otherwise not easy to tell, the teeth stand out but that could be lighting, something you acknowledged. You asked not to mention the other obvious things so I wont talk about your hair :D other than to say that hair is dirty and greasy and is probably half the reason your face stays broke out that way."
amiugly,3dz9jo,cantstopmetonight,3,Tue Jul 21 01:11:04 2015 UTC,"interesting. I wash and brush my hair every day(yes, I can tell how rediculously messy, and gross it looks. same with my teeth and acne). although as mentioned above, I haven't slept much lately. and i've been spending alot of time in bed in general. (and yes I know that sounds strange.)"
amiugly,3dz9jo,iredditi,2,Tue Jul 21 01:24:32 2015 UTC,"Naw bro, I don't mean your hair is greasy and dirty. I mean all hair is, even washing it everyday (which is actually bad for it)."
amiugly,3dz9jo,iredditi,2,Tue Jul 21 01:29:07 2015 UTC,"Hey your post really caught my eye as I also struggle with acne. You're facial structure isn't bad, which means there's hope! If you don't have the money for prescription acne treatment try buying a gentle cleanser, like cetaphil. Do not over wash your face! This will make it worse. you should only wash a maximum of twice a day (morning and evening). Please research over-the-counter benzoyl peroxide treatments. This has made a world of difference for many people. Make sure to use fresh pillow cases and face wash cloths every night/every other night, if you can (sometimes I use a clean shirt over my pillow). Also, regular exercise will help your complexion somewhat. The sweating is great for your pores if you can wash off shortly after. These are inexpensive/free things to start you off, so you can at least try! And an easy fix to the hair is to just shave it all off. This will also help with the acne because hair in face= greasy, and you won't be playing with it as much and keep your hands away from your face. Stop touching your face if you already do, just leave it alone! Grow out your hair when you're ready to tame it. As for the overbite, I recommend saving money any way you can so even if you can't do it now you can do it eventually. The key to better skin is being consistent. Every single day and night otherwise your situation won't change. Better to do some trial and error. Anyways, I hope this helps. Feel better, there's hope!!!"
amiugly,3dz9jo,iredditi,2,Tue Jul 21 01:40:26 2015 UTC,"I honestly think if you get your teeth fixed and acne cleared, you will be very attractive and feel much more confident."
amiugly,3dz9jo,iredditi,2,Tue Jul 21 01:49:37 2015 UTC,"Your facial features aren't bad. Plastic surgery isn't even something you need to consider and that's a good thing!   All the issues that lead you to being considered unattractive are so easily fixable and temporary it's insane. I know what it's like to have poor facial features and trust me you don't have that problem at all.  If you're serious about looking more attractive you seriously need to consider hopping on towards a hair salon. I know you don't want to hear it, but if you want anything to change that's the easiest and quickest step. Getting rid of the acne takes longer, but it will fade eventually with the right regime. The teeth is a simple trip to the orthodontist and a couple years wait. Dude all your issues are superficial and so easily fixed all you have to do is take the first step. Good luck man."
amiugly,3dz9jo,PurpleMurp,2,Tue Jul 21 03:20:53 2015 UTC,"Please consult the male hair subreddit.   That acne looks pretty painful...and cystic, which SUCKS. Can you afford to treat it now, in any way?   Truth--I'm not sure I'd post your face on dating sites right now (I'm assuming that's why you asked for a rating). You might be surprised, and people can see past acne, but I have to admit...I personally would wait until I was successfully able to treat the acne before I started posting online.  I'm sorry, because the acne in particular sucks in live with."
amiugly,3dz9jo,cardbroad,2,Mon Jul 20 20:43:48 2015 UTC,"Nah, I asked for a rating simply because I wanted one. I know i'm not in dating condition, nor did I expect to be.  and I can't afford to treat it, honestly I don't think it will ever go. same goes for my teeth. they're pretty fucked up, and I doubt that those could be fixed either.  as for the hair. i'm not confident enough to get it cut at the moment, haven't been for a long time. I know what I want done with it, but it's not something I can deal with at the moment. that's why I asked if people could try their best to ignore it and pay attention to the face instead.  What i'm looking for are other issues. like my face proportionings and such, like tell me what parts of my face are unflattering. do you think for example I need heavy plastic surgery? because that's what i'm most concerned about. i'm being serious, i've been bullied heavily since I was 6 and i've never had friends. so this is obviously a serious problem.  and i'll never be able to move on until i'm atleast partially attractive or acceptable and i'll dedicate my life to that until it's achieved, because otherwise, I give up."
amiugly,3dz9jo,wowkilledmylife,8,Mon Jul 20 21:03:40 2015 UTC,"No. Your nose, cheeks, and chin are fine. (Man, if you think plastic surgery is cheaper or easier than a dermatologist....plastic surgery is often the creation of new problems, because you are permanently changing your bones, cartilage and nerves, or removing them. Once something goes wrong, you can't just put things back together again.)   If you focus on something, focus on treating the acne and teeth. Your facial structure itself is fine.  I'm sorry you've been bullied. No one deserves that unless they're assholes. No one chooses how they look. And you are normal, even with the bad skin. Being bullied and being alone at 20..that deserves resolution, but you're not going to fix that here.  Do you have any skin regimen at all for the pimples?"
amiugly,3dz9jo,wexfordlad1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:12:03 2015 UTC,"No I don't at the moment. my mums tried getting me into some a couple times, but due to motivational issues among others, needless to say not much happened. we also don't have alot of money for worthwhile products."
amiugly,3dz9jo,sievehockey11,4,Mon Jul 20 21:41:09 2015 UTC,"Work on those.  If you have $30 you can get a salicylic acid toner and spot treatment with benzoyl peroxide or sulfur, but really, unless a treatment is giving you more acne....focus on it. (I mean something like Accutane, btw, but admittedly it can affect mood and fatigue so be aware of it.) Not antibiotics, which lose efficacy after a while.  You need to ask yourself why you'd commit to plastic surgery when you can even stick with an acne regimen (and they suck, I know, but...easier than plastic surgery.)"
amiugly,3dz9jo,boobmuncher,3,Mon Jul 20 21:55:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly I didn't mean plastic surgery in-place of these other things, but rather with as a long term goal.   when seeing my reflection I've always felt nauseous and disgusted, so I can empathise with those who had to put up with my presence."
amiugly,3dz9jo,LeRubsBubs,2,Mon Jul 20 22:05:35 2015 UTC,You are a human being and no one deserves to be treated any less unless they BEHAVE inhumanly.   You have my advice. Good luck. I'm sorry for what you're going through.
amiugly,3dz9jo,novemberbrain,2,Tue Jul 21 01:25:50 2015 UTC,"Seriously man. Your bone structure is fine. all you need to do is get your teeth fixed and clear up the acne a bit, and you will be attractive.  Trust me I know it is hard, but if you stick with it, your face will clear up. Which will improve your looks and maybe give you a confidence boost that it sounds like you desperately need."
amiugly,3dz9jo,novemberbrain,2,Tue Jul 21 03:50:53 2015 UTC,"as for the hair. i'm not confident enough to get it cut at the moment, haven't been for a long time. I know what I want done with it, but it's not something I can deal with at the moment. that's why I asked if people could try their best to ignore it and pay attention to the face instead.   Just get it cut. Yes, you might feel shitty for a little while, but nothing is going to change if you don't make any changes. You can't expect your confidence to reappear if you don't work at it."

amiugly,3e1yde,WitheredSedge,5,Tue Jul 21 09:37:51 2015 UTC,Sadly no...  You look like generic hipster. I hope you are in the band otherwise you are trying to hard   Whats wrong on Lannisters? I like Jon Snow :(
amiugly,3e1yde,PM-ME-IF-YOU-WANT,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:10:56 2015 UTC,"Do you mind elaborating, which picture do I look like a generic hipster in?"
amiugly,3e1yde,PM-ME-IF-YOU-WANT,2,Tue Jul 21 10:15:08 2015 UTC,1st and 3rd.. You have the same outfit on both pictures so yea. I dont mean it like you are ugly or anything. Its just that every single hipster dress like that and I feel the hat is overkill.   You can try all black everything with leather pants with that hat and without  necklace.
amiugly,3e1yde,Genrok,3,Tue Jul 21 13:13:22 2015 UTC,You look a bit like Tyler posey with a beard in some of the pictures  You're obviously not ugly at all

amiugly,3e1yde,bubblybeeboop,2,Tue Jul 21 10:43:24 2015 UTC,"You've tried to look good in the pictures so it's difficult to give an accurate evaluation. You have a look of a chubby Kitt Harrington, though no Lanister influence."
amiugly,3e1yde,bubblybeeboop,2,Tue Jul 21 11:29:31 2015 UTC,"You are really cute and handsome. You seem to have a consistent style - hipster-ee. Which is totally ok! It suits you. The hat/necklace stuff looks good on you but also gives me the impression you are gay? Fine if you are, but if you aren't, just thought I'd mention it."

Your hair, however, while it's styled well is not particularly flattering for your face shape. It elongates your already long face, you could check out male fashion advice and they may be able to direct you towards an even more flattering cut. Perhaps something with bangs? I dunno it's not well within my wheelhouse. Certainly not ugly though and congrats on the improvement overtime. Oh and maybe try to smile in your pictures."

amiugly,3dz5ce,thatgirlspeaks,3,Tue Jul 21 04:20:06 2015 UTC,"Why are you insecure? You're someone that could get all the girls if he just showed a little confidence. Keep your head up, buddy! :)"
amiugly,3dz5ce,thatgirlspeaks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:36:28 2015 UTC,I dunno tbh i just feel like I'm way uglier than everyone else. And I think I'm bad at socialising because of that.
amiugly,3dz5ce,thatgirlspeaks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:09:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's your lack of confidence. I don't know what everyone else is thinking but you're definitely not 'way uglier'. You're adorable. I love your eyes and your hair! I know it's impossible to just immediately feel confident, but there are steps towards it. First step is recognizing that not everyone is going to find you attractive, but that doesn't mean you aren't attractive. :)"
amiugly,3dz5ce,thatgirlspeaks,2,Tue Jul 21 05:36:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for the kind answers :) I really appreciate those. any tips on how to build up that confidence  ? I mean I kinda get desperate pretty fast if something isn't going according to plan. :/
amiugly,3dz5ce,tempoacco,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:55:07 2015 UTC,"That's your biggest problem right there! Women can smell desperate a mile away. If things aren't going according to plan, then you just have to roll with it. You're not going to catch every girl in your web, and you don't want to. You just need to be more easy going, being nervous is normal but overly nervous behaviour is a turn-off. It will take practice and time, but the more pressure you take off yourself, the better.   Hope this helps!"

amiugly,3dz5ce,Firamis,3,Tue Jul 21 00:47:58 2015 UTC,Thank you for the nice answer. I'm really insecure about myself and how i look. I'm definitely not well built since I'm really below the weight for my height. Sorry for my bad English aswell.
amiugly,3dz5ce,carl2k1,6,Tue Jul 21 04:34:21 2015 UTC,Grow a beard. It changes EVERYTHING. Believe me.
amiugly,3dz5ce,nerdpuncher420,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:13:29 2015 UTC,Tranks for the answer. Would actually do that but I really struggle growing growing a beard and I kinda dunno why.
amiugly,3dz5ce,asparagas,2,Tue Jul 21 04:14:46 2015 UTC,You're fine. Grow out your hair a bit
amiugly,3dz5ce,arb10280,2,Mon Jul 20 19:02:09 2015 UTC,Thank your for your answer. Are you talking about the actual hair or about facial hair like a beard or a mustache?
amiugly,3dz5ce,princemephtik,2,Tue Jul 21 04:21:51 2015 UTC,"NOT UGLY. Potential is there. Everybody is going to say it, but try to build up your body. Also, change your hair."
amiugly,3dz5ce,Kristen6,2,Mon Jul 20 19:09:30 2015 UTC,Thank you for the anwser. I was trying to do that but I kinda struggle with gaining weight and building up muscles but I will try to do that. And in which way would you change the hair?
amiugly,3dz5ce,Kristen6,2,Tue Jul 21 04:23:53 2015 UTC,I would say that you look a little bit young but apart from that you look very good. Would give you an 8.
amiugly,3dz5ce,Reddyh,2,Tue Jul 21 03:35:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your answer:). As i said in another response, I really struggle with looking like a 21-year-old. Do you have any advice on how to change that ?"
amiugly,3dz5ce,drmajor840,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:38:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's such a bad thing, maybe practice more regularly to build some muscles. But you're still 21, you don't have to look like a 30 year old, fully grown, bearded man - everybody has different genes and because of that different face structures, so don't worry. For me, the outside is not that important, it's definitely the character what makes a man attractive (not saying you can only count on that in your case! You look nice as well :) ).  Just be you and trust in yourself and, as I said practice some more if you want to and everything will turn great."
amiugly,3dzut9,amuglythrowaway2175,7,Mon Jul 20 21:38:24 2015 UTC,you look like a fun guy and give off a kirk hammett of metallica vibe. i would not cut your hair.   you look burnt to a crisp in one of those photos. you should take care of your skin.
amiugly,3dzut9,twenty8twelve,5,Mon Jul 20 22:23:39 2015 UTC,Not ugly. You look like a fun guy. The hair works for you. Keep it.
amiugly,3dzut9,Cambium29,4,Mon Jul 20 22:59:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, not bad at all, actually pretty cute. I dig the hair. The only thing I'd suggest is that you shave off the stubble. Also, the black suit jacket with white cargo shorts is a little questionable, but you do you! Overall, pretty attractive."

amiugly,3dzut9,ScissorStar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:19:16 2015 UTC,I would say don't chop off the length of your curls but get a better haircut that gives your curls a nice shape. Look for some pics of dudes with curls on  r/curlyhair.

amiugly,3e00xv,Jonpj,4,Mon Jul 20 22:23:49 2015 UTC,"Your hair is too puffy at the sides so it kind of gives your head the shape of a mushroom. I think if you left the length on the top and got the sides cut pretty short, or even clipped/shaved, it would be a big improvement."
amiugly,3e00xv,Cambium29,3,Mon Jul 20 22:31:56 2015 UTC,you look kind. the first photo looks like your groomed your brows a bit too much.   you'd be on the road to being attractive once you lost a bit of weight.
amiugly,3e00xv,twenty8twelve,2,Mon Jul 20 22:25:54 2015 UTC,Haha I never groom my brows
amiugly,3e00xv,tempoacco,3,Mon Jul 20 22:27:43 2015 UTC,"You honestly aren't that unattractive. You have very nice , well rounded features and overall look pretty good. The only thing I'd suggest is maybe change up the hair, it's kind of obscuring your face which generally isn't a good look."
amiugly,3e00xv,enhancedmuppet,2,Tue Jul 21 01:15:54 2015 UTC,Cut the fat! Exercise and eat lean this will get rid of the baby face. Also you have baby face. Nothing seriously wrong with you just maybe a little to much baby stuffed in your face. r/keto.

That's a powerful hairstyle. 11/10!  The circles under your eyes are VERY noticeable, definitely get more sleep. I think there's a cream you can put under your eyes to get rid of those, I don't know for sure on brands and things though.  That's the only ""flaw"" I really notice about you. Your nose is not too big at all, that was not even a thought in my mind when looking at your face.  You want to know that will definitely help you in pictures? Smile.

amiugly,3dzpdp,DylanFTL,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:59:20 2015 UTC,No I am very active. I think it was because I was leaning back to take the photo.

amiugly,3dyt5x,oylooc,2,Mon Jul 20 17:26:50 2015 UTC,Not much of a selfie person. This was not too long after a shower so it usually settles down except around my cow lick I have to gel it down. Not sure what kind of 'swoop' I should go for.
amiugly,3dyt5x,oylooc,4,Mon Jul 20 18:34:25 2015 UTC,"Don't use heavy gel that'll make it look greasy, you want a matte finish, I don't know how to find a picture or video to explain, so I'll try to explain as if you're using your hands. Okay, so put the gel on your hands and rub your hands together so its all over, grab the front of your hair and push to the right but pull up as you're pushing it, only do with one hand as to not get an over zealous amount of gel in it, then 'pat down' the all your other sides of hair, and then go back to the front and just keep push it to the right (or left honestly whichever way you part your hair). I hope this helps! Sorry if its confusing."

You're allowed to like metal but you gotta respect a girl who is nice and awesome as a person but may not share that taste (or even likes stuff you find loathsome).

amiugly,3dywe2,Lavenders2,3,Mon Jul 20 17:35:52 2015 UTC,"Keep your hair pushed to the side instead of forward. Keep your face cleanly shaved, I think I can see some little scraggles. As far as clothing, it's never a bad idea to stick to basics like plain tees and jeans. Consider getting some button ups for a more mature look. I never recommend graphic tees or anything with a big ol logo on it. In the provided pictures you dress like a slumpy teen. Im going l give you the standard advice of ""hit the gym"", you appear to be skinny fat. All this being said, you aren't doing too bad. I'll give you an alright out of ten."

amiugly,3dywe2,zorlot,4,Mon Jul 20 17:56:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you look overweight in the pic. You have a kind-of round and chubby face. I would recommend getting a new hairstyle; your current one isn't very good. Changing the way you dress can also help. You seem to be wearing baggy clothing, but I think you would look better with more normal clothes, like just a normal t-shirt and jeans."

amiugly,3dzqm0,Genrok,4,Mon Jul 20 21:20:36 2015 UTC,"A couple things. You're a young guy but already losing your hair, you're overweight, and you look like you haven't slept well in a very long time. Any one of those things on its own may not mean much but together, they could point to some underlying health problem. I suggest seeing your family doctor about sleep apnea (especially if you snore a lot or never dream), or a thyroid issue.  As far as appearances, because you are losing your hair, a very short style is going to work best. Don't attempt to grow the sides long to make up for what's lacking on the top--it never works and it looks awful. Just get to a stylist and crop that stuff super short.  You have a fairly small chin and mouth area, growing out a mustache and beard will give that area more bulk, and balance out your wide forehead.  Your eyes look really tired; some eye drops may brighten them up.   For wardrobe, try to stay away from the t-shirts; try collared shirts and heavier fabrics that skim over the body and create a smoother line. Stay away from over-sized anything because you are already a bigger guy; get things that fit you well. Ask for help at a men's shop or larger department store if you don't know what works best for you.  You have potential, but you also currently have some issues that need addressing. Work with that and repost in a while."
amiugly,3dzqm0,Cambium29,3,Mon Jul 20 22:52:53 2015 UTC,"Your BMI is 33.     Technically, you are obese.     To have a BMI of 23, you need to lose 70 pounds. It's ok, you don't have to be ashamed because you are fat, the only shameful thing is to do nothing about it. This is why I recommend you give a chance to /r/loseit      Your hair doesn't look too good either. You need to avoid the ""Krusty the clown"" hairstyle. Hair on the top and sides but not inbetween. Keep your hair short. Like maybe half an inch short.      If you can grow a good beard, give it a try and see if it suits you.      Your facial expression indicates sadness. I am not going to tell you to smile and cheer up but try to open your eyes a bit more. Don't appears emotionless.        Good luck."

amiugly,3dzlcq,Sanis_,2,Tue Jul 21 00:39:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly dude, I don't see any problems with your mustache but I think you would look good without it as well, its your choice!  As for the gf, you've never had one, possibly for several reasons, but how good you look is definitely not one of those reasons.  One BIG reason I can see here is that you look like a tough guy to approach when you have that mean look.  An easy fix would be just to smile way more, girls love happy guys, it makes you look more outgoing/approachable and you will love yourself way more every time you look at that happy face in the mirror. Hope this post helps your self-esteem so you can be happier and its just a positive feedback loop from there!"

amiugly,3e1ufu,ElSaborAsiatico,8,Tue Jul 21 19:22:22 2015 UTC,"Because our whole lives are determined by how we look. It's the first thing people notice when they see you, and the first thing they base their impressions on. Most of us are attracted to the same type of the other gender. Nobody wants to date an ugly person. You generally do it because you can't get better. There isn't a guy in the world who would happily date an ugly chick thats 100 pounds overweight without thinking what things could've been like if he was born a model.  It's important because we see ourselves in the mirror every day, and if you hate what you see, you drown yourself in misery and self pity. If your feelings are reinforced by a lack of friends or a partner, you go from disliking how to look to actively hating and and bordering on a full-blown depression. Posting here gives people that outside view. People who don't know you. Random strangers on the internet. Let's hear what they think. Am I truly the abomination I seem to think I am, or is there a way to unlock the beauty that I've just been hiding?  The desire to feel wanted, needed, is strong in everyone. But how can you ask anyone to love you if you yourself hold nothing but contempt for how you look every day? People don't spend 5 days in the gym because it's so much fun to limp down the stairs every day with sore muscles, they do it because they want to appear attractive. Our uglyness, or lack thereof, determines a large portion of how our lives will go. Take the same ugly kid with the same parents and the same school, but go back in time and turn him into something handsome, and his/her whole life would've been different.  Looking good isn't guaranteed to grant you happiness. Looking bad isn't guaranteed to grant you misery. But they really help set you on the path at least."

You have a nice jawline which is hidden by your beard which looks neck-beardy in some pictures (not attractive). Wouldn't hurt if you cleared up your skin a bit.   First impression? You look like a cool dude that likes to have fun, maybe more on the hippy side. You don't look bad but not my type, but don't let that discourage you because women's types in men are way broader than men's types in women."

Your smile is beautiful and you have a good sense of style.   The bob would look cute but I think your long hair looks great so I would keep it. As far as your weight (I say this as a woman who has struggled with eating disorders) you are thin but you look healthy, just eat good foods when you are hungry, stop when you're full,  and don't worry about what people think. You're young and most people tend to get a little heavier looking when they hit early 30s so you're doing fine."

amiugly,3dvioc,Kristen6,3,Sun Jul 19 22:23:45 2015 UTC,"I think you look cute in both the before and after pics. And you could use a little more weight, but you're small-boned and have a great shape, you're not like a stick-skinny anorexic girl. I used to be about your size (5""6/105 lbs) and I was teased a lot too and called anorexic and it made me feel really bad about myself! (I never had an eating disorder). But looking back now, I'd love to be that size again! And TBH you'll be glad when you get older because most people start gaining weight in their late 20s/early 30s and you'll still be slim. (I'm 135 lbs now which is considered average size). I think it's more important to be healthy, so I hope you try to gain weight the healthy way rather than loading up on carbs or something (really, really bad idea and your body will pay for it later). As long as you're healthy, enjoy being petite! I'm sure a lot of ppl who say that stuff are jealous anyway. Also, good fashion choices."
