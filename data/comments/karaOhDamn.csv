karaOhDamn,3b9c0a,pursuitofhappy,5,Sat Jun 27 01:07:48 2015 UTC,Watch the shopkeepers mouth drop and him shake his head to do a double take when the kid first starts belting.
karaOhDamn,3b9c0a,FormulatingDuck,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:39:40 2015 UTC,I love this sub. It needs bigger.

karaOhDamn,3b53nq,pilvy,2,Sat Jun 27 21:57:07 2015 UTC,Yea! I watched it last night. Pretty cool.
karaOhDamn,3b53nq,cchristel,2,Sat Jun 27 22:24:13 2015 UTC,Amazing. I hope this sub keeps it up. I vote more street music!
karaOhDamn,3b0iv8,carleyFTW,7,Thu Jun 25 00:06:22 2015 UTC,Definitely puts a smile on my face! :)
karaOhDamn,3b0iv8,beermeupscotty,5,Thu Jun 25 00:08:39 2015 UTC,How awful would this have been if sam couldn't sing...
karaOhDamn,3b0iv8,searine,3,Thu Jun 25 02:03:56 2015 UTC,"I think it was roughed-out before the show. But, to answer your question: this bad."

karaOhDamn,3aziy3,DeyTa,6,Wed Jun 24 19:29:55 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, those high notes that get so close to belting - sounds exactly like him. Amazing."
karaOhDamn,3aziy3,Itsthejoker,3,Thu Jun 25 04:29:00 2015 UTC,He just needs to learn all the words/English haha but amazing!
karaOhDamn,3aziy3,Semyonov,2,Thu Jun 25 16:55:39 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more.  He seemed kind of shy, some people just don't know how talented they are!"
karaOhDamn,3b0gj1,beermeupscotty,2,Wed Jun 24 23:46:46 2015 UTC,"I always felt she wasn't particularly nice to listen to. She just has an overdramatic vibrato and it sounds like she's mimicking a layperson's idea of generic ""opera."" Her tone really isn't pleasant.  The audience was just surprised because she's dumpy and weird but has a youthful voice. This whole thing was too manufactured for me.  EDIT: It certainly is appropriate to label this ""karaoke,"" though."
karaOhDamn,3ax0d6,beermeupscotty,8,Wed Jun 24 04:33:23 2015 UTC,That's Hollie Cavanagh. She got 4th on American Idol a few years ago.
karaOhDamn,3ax0d6,MrMet86,3,Wed Jun 24 13:43:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, wow, really? No surprise. Who beat her?  EDIT: Oh, this guy. I've heard that song. I thought it was the Lumineers or something!"
