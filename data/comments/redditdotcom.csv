redditdotcom,3dxs3h,PostNationalism,15,Mon Jul 20 12:20:09 2015 UTC,Spain really hates itself.
redditdotcom,3dxs3h,finnurtg,3,Mon Jul 20 13:48:45 2015 UTC,"I thought England would be very self loathing, as they're generally taking the piss out of themselves so much, but Spain, France and Italy are surprisingly less favourable to themselves.  I understand where Spanish people are coming from, as the political climate over the last few years has been fairly anti government. Also you have Catalonia, who will say they dislike Spain."
redditdotcom,3dxs3h,Purdy14,8,Mon Jul 20 19:13:23 2015 UTC,So everybody likes Germany... except for Greece. Greece HATES Germany.
redditdotcom,3dxs3h,phunbabag,5,Mon Jul 20 13:59:54 2015 UTC,It's the opposite for Russia. Nobody but Greece leans in Russia's favor.
redditdotcom,3dxs3h,tysoasn,2,Mon Jul 20 16:08:42 2015 UTC,Greece is the weird cousin who ends up getting arrested in Florida.
redditdotcom,3dxs3h,tipher93,8,Tue Jul 21 00:08:25 2015 UTC,Why does Greece hate the US?
redditdotcom,3dxs3h,eng_pencil_jockey,3,Mon Jul 20 14:04:56 2015 UTC,"I just cant go a day without hearing someone say   ""wow... Greece is such a piece of shit!"""
redditdotcom,3dxs3h,Nevera_,3,Mon Jul 20 17:42:33 2015 UTC,France likes Germany more than Germany likes Germany and a LOT more than France likes France.   The French: we wish we were German.
redditdotcom,3dxs3h,Hyperdrunk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:34:12 2015 UTC,What beef does Italy have with Russia?
redditdotcom,3dxs3h,Tigeris,2,Mon Jul 20 20:59:27 2015 UTC,Wait…I want to know what the US thinks of itself
redditdotcom,3dxs3h,compto35,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:50:48 2015 UTC,"""England"" in not an independent country. It's like listing ""Texas"" instead of ""US"".  Edit: I now see that that's a hotly debated issue:   England is Not an Independent Country England is a country"
redditdotcom,3dxs3h,1Davide,-3,Mon Jul 20 20:11:15 2015 UTC,"Except England is a country....as is the United Kingdom.  The first sentence when looking up England is literally ""England ￼i/ˈɪŋɡlənd/ is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.[2][3][4] "" It is not comparable to a state."
redditdotcom,3dxs3h,ImAzura,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:41:08 2015 UTC,The United Kingdom is not a country
redditdotcom,3dxs3h,TylerD87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:29:12 2015 UTC,"An excerpt from Wikipedia  The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom(UK) or Britain,[nb 5] is a sovereign state in Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, the country includes the island of Great Britain—a term also applied loosely to refer to the whole country"
redditdotcom,3dtkuw,Keelbolt,6,Sun Jul 19 09:18:33 2015 UTC,A place for anything and everything that feels like a place for a specific agenda. This guy/propaganda machine is a plague in more than one small sub.
redditdotcom,3dtkuw,opticon,4,Sun Jul 19 16:25:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's my issue. He seems to flood many smaller subs, making it difficult for true content to come out."
redditdotcom,3dtkuw,PostNationalism,-2,Sun Jul 19 16:28:28 2015 UTC,true content? nobody posts anything here.. ever.. its a dead zone
redditdotcom,3dtkuw,ohthereyouare,3,Mon Jul 20 01:17:58 2015 UTC,"I downvote everything you post, FWIW. You're a spammer, clearly. And not only on this sub, but a few others I subscribe to. You'll get my down arrow every time."
redditdotcom,3dtkuw,dylanrush,6,Mon Jul 20 03:11:18 2015 UTC,"Here's an idea that might help: next time you post something that's OC, and might be kind of interesting to other people, post it here too."
redditdotcom,3dtkuw,ryumast3r,3,Sun Jul 19 23:37:58 2015 UTC,"This is definitely something that I've noticed and I think a lot of others as well (in fact I think I saw several saying they were unsubscribing in comments because of this). The only solution I can think of is to drown out his submissions with other content, but obviously that's not ideal."
redditdotcom,3dtkuw,ryumast3r,3,Sun Jul 19 16:57:22 2015 UTC,"Technically the moderators have the ability to ban him/manually remove his posts if they were so inclined to, so I think that should be the next port of call"
redditdotcom,3dtkuw,PostNationalism,2,Sun Jul 19 16:59:46 2015 UTC,"They could, but considering the description of this sub I doubt it would happen."
redditdotcom,3dtkuw,TheDabbyDabby,-3,Sun Jul 19 17:00:42 2015 UTC,not to mention before i came the last submission was like 6 months ago....
redditdotcom,3dtkuw,silentmage,3,Mon Jul 20 01:18:18 2015 UTC,"This has been a problem for what seems like months. I ought to unsub but I really like the idea of this sub and it was good before, if only occasionally. Haven't seen a mod around here but presumably they should ban him for spam?"
redditdotcom,3du0ln,PostNationalism,0,Sun Jul 19 13:32:11 2015 UTC,Good to finally see a politician concerned with national security. The current regime is intent on destroying the US.
redditdotcom,3dis81,PostNationalism,2,Thu Jul 16 16:39:50 2015 UTC,"More like Angela Jerkel.   Seriously though, why even pretend. ""We're sending you back into hell, young lady, but don't worry we feel reeeally bad about it. Let me stroke you.""  Either have some compassion or don't. Jesus."
redditdotcom,3dis81,SteveCFE,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:11:38 2015 UTC,What would that look like? She's not wrong in saying that thousands are in the same situations and we can't host them all. The problem that refugees are staying in Germany for so long before being send back isn't one that she produced. Of course it shouldn't have come to this and - at least in my opnion - the girl should get German citizenship because she's spend her whole life here and speaks immaculate German but we can't offer citizenship to everyone who wants it. I don't like Merkel or her party but in this instance she made the best out of a terrible situation. She can't offer the girl citizenship so what is she supposed to do? I would go so far as to say that her empathy is just played but what is she supposed to do?
redditdotcom,3dd1e4,PostNationalism,3,Wed Jul 15 08:54:59 2015 UTC,EU Politics seems to be pretty cut-throat.
