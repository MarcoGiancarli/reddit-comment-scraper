UIUC,3e5389,earlobe7,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:01:30 2015 UTC,"It's most likely dead, ""fixing"" probably now takes more money than it's worth.  SD cards have a lifetime ranging from several months to several years depending on well they're made and treated.  Your priority should be evacuation, not fixing.  There's a lot of data recovery software online, and a quick search made it seem like ZAR is a reputable option.  If that doesn't work, I'm sorry, the same has happened to me."

ALL sushi in the US is required to be frozen for a specified time to a specified temperature to kill any potential parasites by the FDA. There is no such thing as ""sushi grade"". Some fish and cuts are better for sushi because of fat content primarily (especially salmon and tuna). There are so many misconceptions about sushi in the US and that store WAY overcharges for fish. I find it predatory how much they charge because they can only get away with it due to most peoples ignorance. You can usually go to Schnucks and get a decent cut of tuna which is perfectly good for sushi. I mean it's tuna. It's almost all caught by boats that stay put for weeks at a time. It's all frozen on the ship. I've yet to find a place down here that has decent salmon so buy it a couple times a year when I'm in Madison."

I took 325 and 435 with Makins and Thaler and they're the ones teaching it next semester as well. 325 with Makins is hard. The homework sets take a while. 435 isn't too bad if you're okay with 212 stuff and vector calculus. I took 486 with someone else so I can't speak to how good/bad Beck will be. But last semester, somebody mentioned that Beck got to the 8th chapter of Griffith's, which is ridiculous (most professors get to/finish chapter 4).  The problem sets for 325/435/486 will take a very long time and if you get unlucky, you might have the deadline for all three on the same day. Additionally, CS 450 isn't too hard but the MP's take a while. Unless you've already done a lot of numerical analysis, you will take O(10) hours to finish one homework (which is assigned bi-weekly, I believe). STAT 400 is pretty easy.

Do you think dropping/switching 435 or 486 would be a lighter load on my shoulders than dropping CS 450? In addition, would the relief of one of these courses give me a good chance in doing well in all of them (A's/B's) or is that still out of the question with this courseload?"
UIUC,3dzmkq,falafellll,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:36 2015 UTC,"CS 225 is easier than 450 but requires about the same work imo (maybe even more if it's your first time with C++); plus, it has more midterms than 450 will probably have, so you'll definitely have a few hellish weeks during the semester where all the midterms collide.   CS 450 is a great class but you have a lot of time left to take it! If you're taking 325 next semester, I'm assuming you're a sophomore? And if you really want to take a numerical methods class, look into 357 as well. I believe it's less work and may be more suited to you. 435 isn't too bad. 486 really varies a lot by professor. I don't know what Beck's like. If you're good with linear algebra, 486 (in principle) shouldn't be too bad. But the homework sets can get really hard. If you were to drop 486 and take like an advanced comp (419's pretty easy) or something, then this would be a good schedule.   I mean, you can get A's in your current schedule, but you'd have very little free time and a lot of all-nighters. It's doable but I'd recommend against it. Take a fun class! Explore other areas and stuff."
UIUC,3dzmkq,McVomit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:18:09 2015 UTC,"You're gonna have a lot of work ahead of you. I took 325 last semester and it wasn't too bad, but you'll have to put in a decent amount of effort. I'm taking 435, 486, & 401 next semester. I've heard mixed things about 435, either you're good with vector calc and it's really easy or it's really hard. Everything I've heard about 486 is that it's hell on Earth, so good luck to the both of us!"
UIUC,3dzmkq,versaceblues,2,Tue Jul 21 21:44:18 2015 UTC,"That is probably one of the most difficult schedules I can imagine. Also if you you aren't good a 3D vector calc (which at the end of the 325 you should be) 435 will be awful.   That being said I took 325, 486 and CS374 last fall. I manage to pass them all with C's putting in about 6-8 hours/week each, and maybe 20hours each during midterms. However if you really want As/Bs you are going to have to probably at least double that."
UIUC,3dzmkq,versaceblues,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:56:55 2015 UTC,"I did a quick calculation and, with this course load, I'll have about -4 hours of free time every week. Would you recommend leaving out 435 out of the trifecta and taking that next semester?"
UIUC,3dz5z0,Venom1000,4,Mon Jul 20 18:42:09 2015 UTC,"Talk to a ChBE advisor, their office is in Noyes or you can use Google to find their information. Off the top of my head you need a 3.1 to transfer in, but I don't know any specifics besides that."
UIUC,3dz5z0,pjurski,5,Mon Jul 20 19:39:15 2015 UTC,"They've been seriously over admitting students the last few years, and the department is already overfilled. I honestly think you'd need better than a 3.1 to get in, especially since the current sophomore and junior classes won't be able to fit into the unit ops labs."
UIUC,3dz5z0,chimpfunkz,3,Mon Jul 20 20:06:12 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be a senior and my class seems pretty small, at least compared to freshman year. I think the requirements should be harder to get into, ChBE is one of the hardest engineering majors and the 3.1 doesn't really reflect that."
UIUC,3dz5z0,pjurski,3,Mon Jul 20 20:27:35 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be a senior too, and while our class is small, the freshman class is huge. Last year's freshman class was 270 students or something, while ours was only 170. The year above us was only 130 or something. The unit ops lab was basically at capacity for the year above us, and is going to be burst at the seams next year."

UIUC,3dz5z0,chimpfunkz,3,Mon Jul 20 23:56:12 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about transferring yet. The Spec Chem sequence is practically the same as that for ChBE in the first year. Both majors take CHEM 202/203/204/205, Calc and Physics in freshman year. The only real difference is that the ChBE students have to take Engineering 100 and ChBE 121 instead of LAS 101 but those courses are not required for transfer students and you won't miss much anyway. You can talk to one of the SCS advisers (I recommend Todd because he's been there the longest) to find out more about transfer requirements for later.   Check out the ChBE RSOs at Quad Day -you can start getting involved with the ChBE clubs before you officially switch majors."

If this is the case, I believe you are technically not allowed to ""officially"" join RSOs of the U of I without being enrolled.  However, most of these things are just mailing lists that students put together to coordinate hanging out or doing an activity, so who cares.

UIUC,3djbps,Vega5Star,5,Thu Jul 16 20:35:05 2015 UTC,"Don't be.   I honestly believe that you have to actively try to shut yourself out to be completely alone at the university. Which means making an active effort against doing something. I'm by no means an extroverted person, but by simply saying yes when people asked to do something the first few weeks of school, you start to pick up a group of friends.   RSOs and other social groups are good too."
UIUC,3djbps,crappyoats,4,Fri Jul 17 01:14:05 2015 UTC,"I mean if you just expect to meet people sitting in your apartment, you'll probably be lonely. If you feel uncomfortable around large groups of people and prefer to spend time by yourself, you'll probably spend a lot of time by yourself. If you want to go out and meet people you have to be willing to actually do the work of going out and meeting people. It might be super scary, it might be easy as shit.  Personally I spend a lot of time on reddit because I'm not really a very social person. I would hazard a guess that a lot of people on here are the same. Not very social people tend to not meet a lot of other people and therefore might feel very lonely.  That or people hear it's a party school and just expect to constantly get invited to parties, or think it's like a movie or something. It's not, and your university experience is what you make of it."
UIUC,3djbps,snakesarecool,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:15:42 2015 UTC,"This is great advice, and I'd like to add to it. Meeting people and making ""friends"" is a skill you have to practice, just like any other skill. The people who look ""naturally social"" actually practiced when they were younger and in grade school. There are lots of self help books about this topic, but most of them center on getting out there and talking to people.  More specifically to students, in 4 or so years you and all of the friends you make here are going to scatter to other cites. It sounds depressing now, but don't worry they'll still be your friends. However you are going to have to meet new people in whatever city you end up in. If you are a professional of any kind it's a good chance you'll have to move and meet new people several times in your career. Since I finished undergrad about 10 years ago I've moved to 4 different cities and had to adjust. This moving and adjusting is why I put friends in quotes in the first paragraphs, there is a difference between the people you hold closely and remain in contact, and the locals who are nice to grab a beer with but are not your closest of buddies. You'll need both kinds of relationships and building the skills to maintain them is worth investing some effort.  Best of luck out there!"

Meeting people at Parkland is easier than UIUC because your classes are smaller and there are more centralized communal spaces.  E.g. chances are you'll be eating lunch in the same place as your classmates.  A smaller population means you'll recognize people more.  Parkland is only limiting if you make it that way.  I have more friends from my Parkland days than I have from my 4-year university days.  Also, meetup.com has some great groups."

There are a lot of older buildings and I would assume that the rent prices will be the same as downtown champaign/grad student areas, but be in walking distance to both campus/class and downtown champaign.

I don't think I've ever seen anyone get hate crime or anything. It's more like people won't really be rude at you but they won't necessarily take the time to get to know you as much... I take that back, its kind of hard to explain until you see it yourself from a minority's perspective. It's not like civil rights era racism but there is still some ignorance. It's not because people want to be rude, it's just the way this country is.  There was a study done a few months ago that show that our generation ranks the highest in that we believe that we are so open minded...but when tested we are just as closed minded as our parents and grandparents.

May not seem like a big deal to some but if you are e.g. gay and someone scrawls ""f*ggot"" on your door you're not really gonna feel safe.

We were unlucky enough to experience a spat of 'Polar Bear Hunting', over ten years ago. This is now referred to as 'The Knockout Game' by the violent black youths who commit such crimes for their sick entertainment.  It wasn't always this way. The HUD Hope VI initiative (and others) has taken its' toll on C-U. When Blacks prey on law abiding Whites, it's not racist to harbor disdain for them."

But you do have a certain small amount of people like the guy above me is who are fairly racist. I think part of the reason is that some people (especially some in-staters, but some international students and out of staters are also offenders) on campus have never actually experienced any diversity or adversity in their life. They experience one hard class they don't do well in, or see one homeless person, or hear about one crime, and the first people they blame are the minorities.  There is definitely animosity here, but it's confined to people you probably wouldn't want to interact with anyway.   Also, this subreddit (and reddit in general, imho) brings out those type of people, so I would take the amount of racists on this sub with a grain of salt.  Honestly though, most people at uiuc are not racist, and there is a huge community of tolerance. (Who serve free lunch!)  tl;dr Uiuc is fine, but some students have been coddled from diversity and adversity their entire lives and have never been taught to value multiculturalism."

I think this is a state school that has a very homogenous student body in the sense that most kids here are white kids who grew up in Illinois and lived here all their lives, and this school feels like a very local bubble vs other schools like Harvard were its rare to have kids that went to high school together. I really don't think this campus is racist in the skin-color type of way, more in the cultural way. If you're not very caught up on midwestern american culture, few people here are going to make an effort to include you, which is why the campus is so strongly segregated. In my opinion the out of state students are much more open minded culturally, but i've got a small sample size. Youre fine"

I have met people who are misinformed or uninformed, but they have always been open to corrections and different thoughts.  International students do tend to hang out with people from the same place.

You don't have any reason to fear 'hate crimes' more than anyone else. You should be fine. However, you will notice a clique culture motivated by race. Lots of Indians and Pakistanis hang out with other Indians and Pakistanis. I don't think this is purely a race thing though. It is a personality/culture thing. Indians and Pakistanis just relate better/interested in similar things/hold similar values. So it makes sense these cliques will exist. If you want to make friends outside your race/culture (which is partly what I think college is about), you can. You need to be open minded and when people of other cultures see you can relate to them and their values, they will not let race come in the way.

As far as I've experienced, the clique-forming that exists largely among racial lines is really more cultural and about people sort of gravitating to others with similar shared past experiences. When you say you're Indian-American, did you spend most of your life in India or in America? Did you go to middle and high school here? If you did then you'll probably not have any issues except for the occasional subtle stereotyping that happens, and that you've probably been exposed to by now. Not to downplay the negative impact that being regularly stereotyped, even subtly, can have, but I doubt that's unique to UIUC.   But absolutely stay off Yik-Yak.

This may be coming from a white male, but in my opinion, racism is at a mild level (and in fairness, I am a more politically-incorrect person than many).  My best advice... just try to be extroverted with others from different cultures. As far as I can see, the problem stems from people wanting to stick to their own comfort zones (both socially and in terms of culture). By doing that, you will be able to interact with all the different cultures without any problems."

UIUC,3dh1xd,gorilla_monster,3,Thu Jul 16 07:16:51 2015 UTC,Do as many case competitions and consulting projects that you can.   There's a wide selection of consulting groups on campus. IBC does various projects. It's also 200+ members and pretty difficult to get in.   OTCR does tech consulting. I heard they like go take younger people and they are quite successful.  EntreCORPS is relativity new (started in 2013) and does start-up consulting. PM me about this if you have questions.   SCNO does non-profit consulting. I actually went to one of their training sessions and really enjoyed it.   There's also IIP. I'm not sure what they do but if you can for sure scope them out if you are interested.   Those are all the consulting orgs I am aware of. IDK how much management consulting experience you will get with these orgs but I have learned a lot working on projects. I have mostly done marketing type projects. Keep in mind that consulting can be challenging and not very structured at all. Communication between PMs and clients is key...something I am just now learning.

I could definitely see that boring the hell out of someone who wants the hustle and bustle of a city.   Again, not to confuse you, OP: you won't get hustle and bustle anywhere.

UIUC,3de1c6,Moruitelda,3,Wed Jul 15 18:54:37 2015 UTC,"That's about a mile from downtown and is one of the rougher areas of town. It's close to a lot of businesses, but that's more like a commercial zone than a city center. Bloomington and Prospect has a lot of payday loans, check cashing stores, fast food restaurants, gas stations, and rental car places. I would not personally recommend living there.  The best rental complex options near downtown are going to be in the area around West Side Park (Church/University and State/Elm). You'll be a 2-3 minute walk from downtown, have good access to the best roads for biking westbound, and so on. Here's a map of apartments in Champaign for you to look at: http://www.trulia.com/for_rent/Champaign,IL/16_zm/40.11194811508307,40.12167887502959,-88.25743660308837,-88.22990640975951_xy/map_v  If I were you, I wouldn't look anywhere in the square bordered by University, Orchard, Windsor, and Neil. That's going to be very heavy with student population.   I would also not look North of University between Neil and Lincoln, as that's a fairly sketchy neighborhood. Same goes for everywhere between Vine Street, Neil, I-74, and Mattis.   Your best bets are going to be in the following areas: Columbia-Neil-John-Prospect, which gets you the best non-student apartment options close to downtown Champaign, and University-Vine-Pennsylvania-Orchard, which gets you the best options close to downtown Urbana. Of the two, Champaign is the bigger city center with more stuff going on.   If you're really feeling like you want to have the downtown experience, you're talking up to $1,300-1,500 for a nice two bedroom apartment inside the Champaign city core (White-State-Columbia-1st), but some of those apartments are really nice and there may be less expensive options. Around West Side Park, you're looking at closer to the $600-800 range."
UIUC,3de1c6,notaflatlander,5,Wed Jul 15 20:59:50 2015 UTC,"Just to add on here -- it takes five minutes to walk from West Side Park to the ""city core"" of downtown Champaign.

As far as I know, you have to take it the same time as you take CS 125.    could I potentially take over 18 hrs   You can always get permission to take an overload. Don't do it this semester. It takes time to adjust to being a college student, and this is your best chance to make friends in your major/in the dorms/wherever else. Don't make your first semester too difficult.  If you really want to add something else, do CS 196. (especially if you already know how to program). But the schedule you gave is perfectly fine for a first semester (I think).     When I went to campus, I got an LAS advisor that, while helpful in many ways, didn't really understand how CS classes work.

The section restricted to 173 students is the honors section of CS 173. You can take any/all of those during the semester you're taking the associated class.

I think the most bonus points you could earn over the whole semester was 15 or 25.   Your quiz score is made to be worth 100 points. The bonus points you earned from lecture are then added to this score at the end of the semester, with the caveat being that you cannot have a final quiz score over 100. So, if you aced every quiz, the bonus points wouldn't help you at all.   I didn't know my final percentage (they only give letter grades at the end of the semester) so it's possible that you can get a quiz score over 100 via bonus points in 211.

Unfortunately, the conference has on many occasions been scheduled for the same weekend as a home game in the past, however it has continued to be very popular and has grown despite the scheduling conflicts. We have not gotten any kick backs from hotels in the history of the conference, including this year.  Football is not the only schedule we are trying to work around. We plan around other UIUC career fairs, major holidays and major conferences. This year, our number one priority was to avoid conflicting with Grace Hopper Conference and give us at least a weekend between the two events.  This greatly increases the number of women speakers able to attend our conference, which has been our main criticism in the past, especially after having no women speakers last year.  I apologize on the behalf of conference for the inconvenience. This is not the first conference held over a home game, and it unfortunately won't be the last. We have a wonderful line up of speakers and companies, and we hope you are able to make it."

UIUC,3denxf,gorilla_monster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:10:13 2015 UTC,That's actually pretty disappointing that they would schedule on a home game weekend when 10/10 is road and 10/17 is a bye week.
UIUC,3denxf,RunisLove,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:49:41 2015 UTC,"I would say it is a major oversight. Not sure if it still can be changed. Hotels around the Chambana area for that weekend are going $200+ a night, Hyatt and Hampton are already sold out. It is making very difficult for visiting delegates (like us from ACM@UIC) to cover cost for everyone who wish to attend.  The week after, hotels wide open with $70 nights available."

UIUC,3dd60m,DerpStar7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:01:19 2015 UTC,"It's similar to jerky.   However, current US jerky (unlike what I remember from my youth) is made with huge amounts of strong flavoring like sugar, soy sauce, artificial smoke.    Biltong is lightly spiced, i.e. largely tastes of meat.    It's also sliced thicker and not as dry.     In South Africa, biltong is made from game meats (e.g. impala) as well as beef.    The US biltong makers seem to do only beef not e.g. venison."

Psychiatrists aren't always the best professionals to go to for this type of thing, a psychologist may be helpful to you.

UIUC,3dbkqy,AmazonSnuSnu,0,Wed Jul 15 04:06:19 2015 UTC,"I also second this.  I met with a psychologist at McKinley for my entire first semester at UIUC to deal with OCD and depression, and she was fantastic.  She really helped pull me out of a painful downward spiral in ways that my previous two psychologists weren't able to.  Scheduling was extremely simple and we made amazing progress together.  OP, I'm so sorry to hear that you live your life feeling like this.  I hope that you please seek some help dealing with these issues.  As someone who has faced many of these same issues and has pulled out of it, life can be such a beautiful thing.  I hope that you see it as such one day."

Talking to a good counselor that you find a connection with can help, mainly because you hear yourself telling the truth out loud and that enables you to face it more fully. But the only way I've ever gotten around, over, or temporarily out from under clinical depression is 1) anti-depressants (ones that worked for my body chemistry -- it can take trial and error with different formulations) and 2) incremental daily action.   That could just be a 1 hour walk each day. Or a forced phone call to a potential friend. Or getting some work done early. Or cooking a healthy meal. You've got to start lifting the weight of the world once a day to do what seems impossible. That could just be taking a shower. It doesn't matter. When you do whatever that is, every day, one thing, until it's two things, then three, you tell yourself you are doing it because you take care of what matters to you. Eventually, you might believe it. And then you'll find you start mattering to other people, too. It's hard work, but it can get better."

UIUC,3dbkqy,Spooler2,2,Wed Jul 15 03:52:02 2015 UTC,"From experience, the McKinley psychiatrists are just your typical psychiatrists: nod and prescribe. I've visited multiple psychiatrists before (1 at McKinely and several back home) and they are generally like that. Generally not too helpful and solves problems by throwing pills at you. Not saying pills are bad because they worked for me, but I think in your situation you should find someone who can give you counselling rather than a psychiatrist who like many other psychiatrists just like throwing meds at patients.   I already had a depression diagnosis back home and in my first visit to McKinely, it literally was 30 mins and I walked out with a month long prescription for Lexapro and Wellbutrin (though I was already on it before my visit). They are great at providing super budget cheap psych meds, but for counselling etc, my experience was pretty BS. It was like walking into McD's for an order of chicken nuggets, but I got prescription meds instead."

The counseling center here is bullcrap. They only offer 8 sessions during your undergraduate years TOTAL. I recommend seeing an outside therapist. Try Kevin Elliot Counseling in Downtown Champaign. As for a psychiatrist, try Albert Lo or Cindy Sundeen by County Market. Things CAN be better. And they WILL be. Just put the work in to find someone who can help you. You are clearly suffering and want to get better. That's the first step and that's good. Just put some effort into trying to find a good therapist and psychiatrist. If one therapist doesn't do it for you after a couple meetings, find another. I personally see Renee St Clair at Compass Counseling (she used to be at Kevin Elliot). She knows when I'm anxious I don't eat, so she always brings me food and coffee. She tells me that WE are going to get me through my anxiety. The medication is important for severe cases too. That's why I recommend Cindy Sundeen. She's an APN, but works alongside an MD. And she's freaking amazing. Not only does she prescribe me medication, but she actually listens and works with me. She's like a second therapist. Please do yourself a favor and find someone who works for you. You WILL get better."

Campustown is also cool, and looking through the buildings around the quad can definitely be a good time. They're big, old, and beautiful. But there's not much going on.   In the area around us, there are interesting things to see. Homer Lake is nice; so is Lake of the Woods. Chanute Air Base in Rantoul is worth a look. Monticello is nice, and also features Allerton Park.   But there's not much in terms of sightseeing. Most of what makes this area nice is food and events. In terms of restaurants, there's enough to keep you buys for weeks. My personal favorites are, in rough order:   Black Dog (Barbecue) Pizzeria Antica (Neapolitan Pizza) Radio Maria (Tapas & Upscale American) Maize (Mexican Taqueria) Pekara (American Sandwich/Coffee) Farren's (Burgers) Sun Singer (Sandwiches & Wine Bar) Bacaro (Upscale American)   There are many, many more delicious options in and around the area, and also a ton of great dessert options:   Jarling's Custard Cup (Frozen Custard) Cream and Flutter (Cupcakes)"

UIUC,3dcoaz,mtlyoshi9,4,Fri Jul 17 03:30:22 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the class. It sounds like you're an incoming freshman, so here's a protip: in college, homework takes a much less direct influence on your grade. You will be assigned homework in most settings, but much of it may not be graded or even collected. It's purely for your own learning.  For the purposes of your question here, what class(es) are you talking about in particular?"
UIUC,3dcoaz,apschmitz,6,Wed Jul 15 06:29:06 2015 UTC,"This is definitely true, but also a more specific answer to the question: you will generally not get homework from both the lecture and the discussion. Some classes will assign homework in lecture, some in discussion. Some will collect it in lecture, some in discussion, and the collection doesn't necessarily match where it was assigned (although it usually will).  If you're the type of person who leaves homework until literally the last minute, then: 1: cut that out; sometimes your homework will take unexpectedly long, so that might not work, and 2: yes, some space before your discussion might come in handy.  If you plan ahead a bit more than that, you can do your homework in the afternoon/evening beforehand, and not worry about your schedule. That's probably best, because you may want to batch your classes during the day, so you're not in class or waiting for one all day every day."

Have an absolute and clear understanding and agreement of who pays what.  If a responsibility doesn't have to be shared and can be handled as 4 separate individuals instead (cell phone bills, grocery shopping, laundry, et cetera) - keep the responsibilities separated.  If you each are paying a portion of a bill - each of you should submit the payment to the billing company, not each hand a pile of money to one guy who will make the payment.  If the bill is in your name, keep a safety net large enough to pay it off and close the account in case they flake on you.  Have every resident's name on the lease.

Also, if you guys are buying groceries together, I highly recommend using the Splitwise app. It makes tracking who owes what so much easier. In terms of chores, clean up the dishes right after you eat, vacuum the apartment at least once every other week, and KEEP THE BATHROOM CLEAN. Can't stress the last one enough.

Sometimes the term is used when the large depth of field is simulated with digital post-processing; the name may derive from a perspective control lens (or tilt–shift lens) normally required when the effect is produced optically.  ""Tilt–shift"" encompasses two different types of movements: rotation of the lens plane relative to the image plane, called tilt, and movement of the lens parallel to the image plane, called shift.    Image i - Example for a creative photograph taken with a tilt-shift lens. The lens was shifted downwards to avoid perspective distortion: all vertical lines of the skyscrapers run parallel to the edges of the image. Tilting around the vertical axis resulted in a very small region in which objects appear sharp. (The depth of field is actually not reduced but tilted in reference to the image plane.)

Get it somewhere else now (if you've already graduated).  Below is a data management exiting brain dump...  Presuming all your crap is really just your own crap:   Absolutely make a backup local copy on your own or copy all your crap over to another cloud service. Having physical and cloud backups is a great solution as well.  1 and 2 TB harddrives are cheap as hell on amazon.   Maybe some of your crap is team research crap:   Connect with your PI to see what you can and cannot take with you.  Do not delete any of your content until you confirm that they have their own copy.  The IRB may have opinions on what data you should have access to or move out of box. Encourage your PI to get a 'team' box account to store project data and materials.  The university and PI/faculty are co-owners of the folder, so there's no issue of it going away after a student leaves.   Maybe some of the crap is your personal research crap (likely most relevant if you are/were a grad student):   Consider depositing presentations, posters, papers, etc. of note (e.g. conference materials or publications) into IDEALS (ideals.illinois.edu/browse). Contact Research Data Service (http://researchdataservice.illinois.edu/) if you have significant research data you'd like to archive.

UIUC,3d6cnm,jhett93,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:50:31 2015 UTC,A lot of RSOs have media or publicity VPs and part of their role is taking photos of club activities.
UIUC,3d6cnm,qqqyqnz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:34:16 2015 UTC,Definitely check out 50Diamonds. They'll give you different jobs at private events or just the bar scene in general.
UIUC,3d6zt5,lilyaintaG,3,Tue Jul 14 00:37:38 2015 UTC,"Yes. You can check out keys from the front desk. There's a stove, microwave, and refrigerator (although it's not wise to store anything in it)."
UIUC,3d6zt5,tychomarx,2,Tue Jul 14 00:42:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is a shared kitchen on the first floor of Wardall. I believe you have to check out a key from the desk to use it."
UIUC,3d6zt5,bromine799,2,Tue Jul 14 00:43:10 2015 UTC,yes
UIUC,3d6zt5,sweet_dolla_tea,2,Tue Jul 14 04:26:36 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to add that we have a bunch of bowls, pans, and spoons and stuff at the front desk as well to be rented out along with the key :)"
UIUC,3d4bpx,AlmostGrad100,6,Mon Jul 13 12:26:05 2015 UTC,"A lot of items are overpriced and are way more expensive than at county or co-op, even for identical items. I found more than a few items that were double the cost online"
UIUC,3d4bpx,kesselvon,2,Mon Jul 13 16:23:04 2015 UTC,"Double the cost of what could be purchased on line factoring in shipping costs?  One should generally expect standard items to cost more at a stand alone shop versus a chain like County Market. If one can afford to - one shops at smaller local retailers/shops to keep some businesses anchored in the local community rather than elsewhere. Coop, SF, World Harvest and Sun Singer and other locally based shops are, from a business perspective, often the antithesis of Walmarts and such. Shop at these smaller places to keep local businesses in business, to get specialty items, to buy a wider range of locally produced good, or to maintain solidarity with local workers/owners but don't expect them to be hitting the price points the big stores achieve via bulk buying and leverage.  They generally can't for standard items."
UIUC,3d4bpx,bubrahucize,2,Tue Jul 14 15:37:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed. That does not justify why Strawberry Fields should be priced higher than Coop, and still expect to be in business."
UIUC,3d4bpx,domasai,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:02:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, but when the markup is ridiculous you can't use that excuse. The co-op has more reasonably priced items than strawberry fields, even with the markup included."
UIUC,3d4bpx,kesselvon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:04:08 2015 UTC,I have not been there yet so I can't comment on specifics. Is it many items? A few items? All items? A business owner can price things however they wish. They have no obligation to you to price them where you want the price to be. The result may be that they do less business or go out of business if they are out of touch with their customers. But since this is not a monopoly situation their prices do not deprive any one of products. I'm just saying their reasonable prices may not be yours so you vote with your feet (as domasai said above) and shop elsewhere.
UIUC,3d4bpx,bubrahucize,3,Wed Jul 15 19:15:10 2015 UTC,I'm happy it's back and happy they retained so many of the former staff - but I'm a little nervous about the new management.  Given World Harvest's track record and attitudes towards expiration dates - I'd be much more reticent to shop in a place where freshness is a bigger issue.
UIUC,3d4bpx,TheFirstAndrew,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:44:22 2015 UTC,"I worked there for three years,. Trust me, management can't possibly be worse than it was before."
UIUC,3d4bpx,yobkrz,3,Mon Jul 13 19:19:04 2015 UTC,"Given what happened, I don't disbelieve you - but I never saw expired products on the shelves there.  In World Harvest, expired products are proudly advertised."
UIUC,3d4bpx,TheFirstAndrew,2,Mon Jul 13 19:30:02 2015 UTC,It aint expired if it is from this century.
UIUC,3d4bpx,aniseikonia,2,Tue Jul 14 20:14:02 2015 UTC,What's a year or 15 beyond the expiration date?
UIUC,3d4bpx,domasai,2,Tue Jul 14 20:58:09 2015 UTC,And is so expensive in the new avatar that the loyal customers vow never to return...
UIUC,3d4bpx,melatonia,3,Mon Jul 13 15:30:59 2015 UTC,"Is it more expensive than before? I only shopped the bulk food aisles there, hopefully those prices are the same."
UIUC,3d4bpx,lapiz-es-azul,2,Mon Jul 13 16:11:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's more expensive than it was before, but it is pretty pricey. On the few items I was able to do a direct comparison for, it was invariably more expensive than the co-op. It does, however, have a wider selection of some items."
UIUC,3d4bpx,fiendskull9,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:18:55 2015 UTC,We'll be waiting with open arms for you if you decide to return and join the hoardes of loyal long-term customers that never left :)
UIUC,3d4bpx,bubrahucize,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:04:44 2015 UTC,"Just for info sake - this taken from webmd (other sites have similar notes) (it's generally not a safety issue):   ""Sell by"" date. The labeling ""sell by"" tells the store how long to display the product for sale. You should buy the product before the date expires. This is basically a guide for the retailer, so the store knows when to pull the item. This is not mandatory, so reach in back and get the freshest. The issue is quality of the item (freshness, taste, and consistency) rather than whether it is on the verge of spoiling. Paul VanLandingham, EdD, a senior faculty member at the Center for Food and Beverage Management of Johnson & Wales University in Providence, R.I., tells WebMD the ""sell by"" date is the last day the item is at its highest level of quality, but it will still be edible for some time after. ""Best if used by (or before)"" date. This refers strictly to quality, not safety. This date is recommended for best flavor or quality. It is not a purchase or safety date. Sour cream, for instance, is already sour, but can have a zippier, fresh taste when freshly sour (if that's not an oxymoron!)"
UIUC,3d4eh1,stop_snoopin,21,Mon Jul 13 12:55:18 2015 UTC,its going to be loud as fuck  some of your roommates are inevitably going to be assholes  20 way split on utilities could be annoying  good luck finding fast enough internet for 20 people to use  also pretty sure there's a law about more than four unrelated people living in the same dwelling but that may just be urbana
UIUC,3d4eh1,rhinowing,2,Mon Jul 13 13:06:57 2015 UTC,"Good points. I want to clarify that the location we have in mind has 20+ bedrooms, so it's not like we are cramming 20 people into a space that is supposed to fit 4. It wouldn't really make sense if the law you mentioned applied to this house, but I'm glad you brought it up, I'll look into it"
UIUC,3d4eh1,umenthum,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:17:30 2015 UTC,"Just postulating, but I think the way it might work with these places is they actually are constructed and leased as many separate apartment units with <=4 residents/unit, they just lease the whole building to a large group at once. The logic being that if the market for leasing 20+ bedrooms fails, they can always fall back to renting the building as separate standard size units."
UIUC,3d4eh1,the_reddit_intern,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:05:41 2015 UTC,"So I ended up doing a fair bit of research into the building/Urbana zoning laws. The building in question is classified as a ""rooming house"", as opposed to just a normal 4 person house. This is the same classification I think Urbana frats and sororities have. That being said, I looked into the city ordinances, and it said that rooming in houses can have a maximum of 15 people, but I'm not sure if I read that correctly. So instead of sending myself on a wild goose chase through the ordinances/Illinois constitution/ whatever, I just emailed the landlord and asked the legal max capacity of people living there. While I'm waiting for a response, I'll keep digging. I'm really thankful for your guys' feedback as I would have not even known to check this out"
UIUC,3d4eh1,historeee,6,Mon Jul 13 16:39:40 2015 UTC,"I have lived in my fraternity house for the past 2 years. Its gonna get dirty, especially when dishes/bathrooms don't get cleaned. Luckily we have Evans Scholars do our dishes (like they do for many fraternities/sororities) and have a assigned house manager to assign chores so that they get done (eg vacuum floors, straighten up the living room, party cleanup etc.). We have the business level internet and just upgraded our routers. It gets expensive, but we never see the costs. Since it is certified student housing, we may be able to get certain other benefits on utilities etc, but also have to go through compliance checks (which you will not have to go through).   Another thing, its gonna get loud, be prepared to never do any of your homework your house. People will eat your food. 2 or 3 is easy to manage, but more likely than not, with 20 people unless it has a name on it, it will be eaten by somebody that isn't you. Best to have a pantry that you all can share.   Also if you are all women, look at the laws to make sure that what you will be living in would be considered a harem according to the law (One of the cities have a stupid law of more than 6 unrelated women under a roof is a harem or something like that)."
