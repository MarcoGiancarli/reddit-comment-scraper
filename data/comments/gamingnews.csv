gamingnews,3dviab,savejustincarter,10,Sun Jul 19 21:41:23 2015 UTC,Half a million dollar bail for a Facebook comment.  Pretty sure the 8th amendment has something against excessive bail.
gamingnews,3dviab,luvmilkshakes,11,Sun Jul 19 22:39:56 2015 UTC,An anonymous donor posted the entire half million.
gamingnews,3dviab,EverGlow89,0,Sun Jul 19 22:47:51 2015 UTC,I find that so hard to believe. I'm sure they realized that was an unconstitutional amount and the money was miraculously donated to avoid legal troubles.
gamingnews,3dviab,amazingmrbrock,2,Mon Jul 20 16:19:50 2015 UTC,"I found it hard to believe too, but I assure you that a real person, posted that bond."
gamingnews,3dviab,mrmodeste2,7,Mon Jul 20 17:14:43 2015 UTC,Article title plays the pronoun game. Include the actual subject to get clickthroughs.

gamingnews,3dviab,DeewaTT,4,Mon Jul 20 22:24:17 2015 UTC,"Jul 6, 2015 — Just an update that the DA's office is still pursuing the case against Justin Carter. It was been over 2 years, and due to his bond conditions, he is essentially under house arrest. Which basically means his life has been on pause for the last 2 years. He couldn't even celebrate his 21st birthday due to his bond conditions. So please keep it up, sign the petition, and let the DA know that you haven't forgotten him! Thank you!"
gamingnews,3dviab,ad88,4,Sun Jul 19 21:42:02 2015 UTC,FYI the relevant case is Watts vs The United States not Brandenburg vs Ohio.  It should be an open and shut case in court.

gamingnews,3dviab,internet_man_415,5,Mon Jul 20 22:08:49 2015 UTC,How can this be real? It is so immensely absurd that I cannot even believe it.
gamingnews,3dviab,Harv23,7,Mon Jul 20 00:35:00 2015 UTC,My son and I have been living this nightmare for 2 years....I still can't believe it either.
gamingnews,3dn6hi,VideoGameNewser2015,4,Fri Jul 17 17:07:52 2015 UTC,"It's kind of nice to see the gaming community rally in positive support.  I still don't understand or comprehend GamerGate and as of late, gaming seems to be moving a direction I don't exactly agree with, but at the end of the day, it's nice to see that there is still so much common ground."
gamingnews,3dn6cn,VideoGameNewser2015,3,Fri Jul 17 17:06:59 2015 UTC,"This Kickstarter makes a joke of the whole system. Anyone who actually does game development knows that the amount they asked for is super low. The result? A team requesting a real budget will have their project compared to this one, and pressured into asking for less. It's now a race to the bottom.  All legitimate Kickstarter campaigns will suffer as a result.   EDIT: I fully expect to be downvoted into oblivion by fans of the game that don't understand what I'm getting at. It has nothing to do with the game, and everything to do with Sony using Kickstarter as an ad campaign."
gamingnews,3dn6cn,Scorpinock,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:16:52 2015 UTC,"And yet it still didn't get enough funding for it to be open world, also it's confirmed that Sony will be funding it a considerable amount... It's a damm expensive game that's for sure."
gamingnews,3dn6cn,Tocoe,2,Fri Jul 17 18:34:23 2015 UTC,"Nope. Shenmue 3 will already be ""open world"" at the current funding level. At least in the same style that Shenmue 1 and 2 were. Their definition of ""open world"" differs quite a bit from modern sandbox-style games. With more money, more bells and whistles would be added to the game, and its three locations expanded with various extras.  Also, Sony is not substantially funding the development of the game. That's what the kickstarter is for, plus contributions by Shibuya Production (co-producer of the game) and a few other unknown investors. Sony will mainly handle marketing for the game."
gamingnews,3dn6cn,rokama,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:56:19 2015 UTC,"Oh, but I thought they said it wouldn't be ""truly open world"" unless they reached 10mil? But I agree, I can defiantly see the world being similar to how it was done in the first two with the budget they have."
gamingnews,3dn6cn,Tocoe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:33:29 2015 UTC,"Here's the direct source that started this ""open world"" confusion. Given that he doesn't really speak English, something might have been lost in translation there. Anyway, in the Twitch stream today he said the game world would be at least as open as Dobuita (Shenmue 1)."
gamingnews,3dl6q9,ipadianfallout,7,Fri Jul 17 04:07:58 2015 UTC,The game's success underscores why developers like Konami are abandoning big budget console games to focus on the mobile space.
gamingnews,3dl6q9,BadMrFrostySC,2,Fri Jul 17 05:40:39 2015 UTC,"It also helps that this is not a competitive game, you're paying micro-transactions on a single player experience. It's hard to make a single player pay-to-win, rather you're just giving players an option to purchase more items for themselves."
gamingnews,3dl6q9,zerow6789,2,Fri Jul 17 13:21:03 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a ""free"" game."
gamingnews,3dl6q9,charlestucker3rd,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:51:26 2015 UTC,In game purchases or donations I guess
gamingnews,3dl6q9,Red_Rubber_Ball_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:21:13 2015 UTC,Which proves than you can just throw on the market whatever game (as long as it has popular franchise skin) and earn a lot of money. Seems Konami was right after all.
gamingnews,3dl6q9,NekoiNemo,3,Fri Jul 17 08:19:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is just throwing whatever game up there with a popular skin. It's a single-player game that allows for micro-transactions that give you more items to keep building. Because there is no competition with other players, you can't really ""pay-to-win."" I think it also helps that this may just be a mobile game, but it is made by professional game developers rather than the usual small indie teams, or large cash-in companies like Zynga, or the Candy Crush people."

Surely that's incorrect, the prize money is split between the Top X teams."
