design_critiques,3e5hkp,R2DJones,2,Wed Jul 22 02:46:56 2015 UTC,"ok here goes,   displays all wrong for me (1920x1080). the width is much wider than my screen and it loads to an entire black screen.  scrolling to the right reveals empty white space.  the section for track listing seems completely unnecessary.  the song that stays statically at the top while scrolling, doesn't play. i don't understand the point of the down arrow button on the second section.  you used a cursive font that looks a lot like comic sans. i dont think it actually is, but its close enough to warrant a lashing. everything is just way too big.  you have links to their social media pages, but none work. album cover at the bottom doesn't load.   i would keep it to one page. no scrolling is needed. there just isn't that much information there to warrant scrolling through 3 pages. form follows function. think of what info you would want to see and have access to first if you were visiting an unknown musician's site for the first time. your main focus should be the preview track. then album art. then social media links. then extra stuff like track listing and about the band (person). hope my opinions and suggestions will help!"

design_critiques,3e3pn0,Pchiit,4,Tue Jul 21 18:45:55 2015 UTC,"hi Pchit,  Here are my 2 cents on your design. I like the color choice. However I think the triangles in the background and the triangles in the logo don't mix well.   I also don't think that they should be touching each other just barely. Either go all out and combine the triangles or let some space between em. I made some quick sketches for you.  Also the interlacing on your background is kind of fucked. (The white lines between the triangles.)  I think you can add the name under your logo, but only if you don't have the upper space G in it. Upper space inside of a word always makes me think of a Gamertag not a serious Channel. (13-year old vibe)"

design_critiques,3e3pn0,SteamPunk_Devil,-1,Wed Jul 22 07:25:46 2015 UTC,It looks good the logo is simple yet pretty unique and recognizable but I would put you name bellow it. I believe the general rule is if you can't get a name from the logo you add your name
design_critiques,3e26vt,Mediaboy13,6,Tue Jul 21 11:34:08 2015 UTC,"My only criticism would be that I don't think you need the logo to exit the screen after it's been displayed. It seems like needlessly added time. Having the logo stay in the same place once it's enter the composition would be much more effective and memorable. Then you can simply cut or fade to your content.  Edit: also, once the background has gone darker, I think it should stay darker rather than lighting back up again"

design_critiques,3e26vt,JakeWinfred,2,Tue Jul 21 19:41:43 2015 UTC,I dunno what  op used but this could be made with After effects (the animation) and illustrator or Photoshop for the logo.

design_critiques,3e26vt,YourFloorIsLava,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you. My channel actually revolves around pranks, challenges, vlogs and comedy in general. So maybe it doesn't exactly relate directly to the style of logo."
design_critiques,3e2i7b,BollickPorridge,4,Tue Jul 21 13:29:40 2015 UTC,"I agree: lose the outline around the horizontal line. Try using wood-ish colors for the ""V"" image. Also try replacing the black lines in the picture with negative space. Might make the whole thing look cleaner and more professional.  Something kinda like this. Just my 2 cents."
design_critiques,3e2i7b,closer2thelung,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:27:39 2015 UTC,"second this. it also adds a bit of depth and meaning to the logo when the texture represents the craft of the company. the colors are just overall bad, bad, bad."
design_critiques,3e2i7b,mistershmi,2,Tue Jul 21 22:46:35 2015 UTC,Nice. I'd lose the border around the horizontal line beneath the name.

Dont have any outlines around any of the buttons - it doesnt add much Give your feed, liked, and profile icons a little more space around them. They're too close to the edges.  Why is there a camera icon top right on the feed section? Seems out of place. Lose the 100% free to use and replace it with something about what the app does   Good luck!"
design_critiques,3e0ut8,maybewrong47,2,Tue Jul 21 02:23:22 2015 UTC,"The header/nav section is gross.  All the white text on black background is also somewhat difficult to read.  This simply lacks any sort of professional sheen.  Most of the graphic tiles should be changed - tons of little text that is almost completely unreadable.  Is this a store?  If so, where are the products?  There's a giant picture of a truck above the fold... which is cool... but aren't you supposed to be selling stuff?  To be honest, the website just feels like it has too much design.  Keep it to the basics - focus on the products and the form will follow.  Soooooo... if you get the job, do I now get a cut?"

design_critiques,3dzvob,notkristina,3,Mon Jul 20 22:33:56 2015 UTC,"I'd like to second this. You don't need to see the album name (or cover) while you're building a playlist. You can put the number of likes on the heart button instead of above it. Share and Add can both become icons. I'm not sure why you'd need scrubbers on every song...can't you have just one scrubber at the top or bottom, since you're only listening to one song at a time? Unless this music streaming site is about creating mashups of course! :)  I don't necessarily mind the blue, I don't think, but personally I'd need to see the interface simplified in order to be sure."
design_critiques,3dzvob,notkristina,2,Tue Jul 21 00:42:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know why I haven't thought of this, but all the scrubbers make it look repetitive and complicated.

design_critiques,3dz8q6,mtgentry,2,Mon Jul 20 20:29:04 2015 UTC,"Fun idea : )  A couple thoughts:   Have you tried limiting the color palate? A lot of times simply reducing the number of colors can make something stand out more graphically. If you do an image search on google for ""aesthetic apparatus poster"" you can see what I mean. I wonder if the orange bar can be removed. My eye wants to go up and down the stairs but the orange bar stops it from doing so.  Maybe try the font without an outline? Generally that sort of thing is frowned upon because it slightly hinders the readability of the typeface.   Good luck!"
design_critiques,3dz8q6,manys,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:33:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your answer!   I read on zevendesign about the color palette. In fact my first idea was to use only red, blue and yellow. But then I couldn't put a red, blue or yellow background, it couldn't fit. So I used a purple background. I couldn't figure out how to use only those colors. Maybe with just two of them? The bar is where I put the date and the place of the gig. It's okay if it keep your attention on it, I guess. I didn't think about it! I'll give it a try."

design_critiques,3e0m0u,HAND_HOOK_CAR_DOOR,2,Tue Jul 21 02:33:39 2015 UTC,"what was your initial concept? It's hard to read the message you're trying to get across. Needs a more focused direction, even to be broad."

design_critiques,3e0m0u,HungryMoon,2,Tue Jul 21 02:56:46 2015 UTC,"Well using your initials is a good idea. What you trying to say about yourself by using your initials? When using this kind of imagery it's usually a very personal statement. I understand where o are coming from. you try keep in the spin of it straight and flipping it? Did one of your iterations use a break or something of the sort to further separate the B and S? It's a little too flat, I feel that a little dimension would help."

design_critiques,3dyaja,Samurr,3,Mon Jul 20 15:00:19 2015 UTC,"Taking a quick look at your site, I really don't like that the project info is in the sidebar. I was scrolling up and down thinking you hadn't added any until I noticed it. Also, the project description causes the sidebar links to float over your social icons.  You have a typo in ""Don't Quote Me on This"" in the hover thumbnail.  For the projects with video only, you should add some stills because not everyone looking for a graphic designer is willing to sit through several videos.  I'd add some more description to your project pages. For example, the iPhone app just has a column of very similar-looking images lined up. Speak more about your thinking behind the design, what you were trying to accomplish, what using the app is like (for example, why the Orsen Welles quote? Does the app generate a random inspirational quote everyday?)."

If you want to have your face present when the user is viewing your portfolio, then I would suggest making your photo much smaller.

design_critiques,3dyaja,ChevronCat,2,Mon Jul 20 16:53:48 2015 UTC,"Hey, I quite like it! I think the nav could be a little hard to read, let me put my glasses on. Okay, I think the fonts are good, but on your portfolio, they're the same font, just differ slightly, it's hard to see the definition clearly. Lato might be a font worth looking into or Open Sans for titles.   On your 'About' page, I'd recommend spacing the links a little, they're quite condensed. It might be worth hitting up /r/resumes for help on the bio, it doesn't feel person and feels bland. Resumes will help as they did for me. Though, I use a (ex) as a copy writer.   I really liked the information displaying on the side bar, though, maybe enlarge it by a few percent to give more readability.   I noticed odd urls, I'd recommend having it /iPhone-Project or /COMPANY/BRAND name.   It doesn't work properly on the mobile. I'd reduce the front image, move the navigation above the image.   The information on the sidebar on mobile doesn't use the correct font, it defualts to a web-safe. It's like no CSS is being active (not checking dev tools).   On motion graphics, I'd space out the videos.   I provided some CSS for you for iPhone 5 at least.   .logo {     float: left;     width: 50%;     margin: 10px 30px; }  I can't check for other pages, but yeah, smaller logo is a must and show off your projects quickly. :)"

design_critiques,3dyaja,razzmicberry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:52:03 2015 UTC,"As said before, bad idea to use the nav section both for navigation... then switching it out entirely for information.  TBH, you don't really even need a nav section - there are only two pages there...  The information for the portfolio items should be grouped with the items.  It doesn't make sense to have to look back to the nav sidebar to read about it.  Try to improve the typography, text doesn't look very nice.  Would be nice to have the previous/next controls closer to the content.  Feels like I'm moving all over the place, would be nice to have it more focused.  In general, it's not very 'browsable'.  I have to click on anything I want to see, can't just scroll through a bunch of it.  On the flip side, all the images are very large, such that I can only really view one at a time.    Rather than just talking shit about it, what should a good portfolio look like?  It should be simple, where content is first and foremost.  it should be very easy to browse - keep it lightweight and not too many pages.  Don't make the user work to view your stuff.  Portfolio items should presented in such a way that the viewer fully understands and can appreciate the project."
