WaitingForATrain,3axqpq,Jetblast787,2,Wed Jun 24 13:20:56 2015 UTC,I've actually been on this one!  It was pretty neat.
WaitingForATrain,3axqpq,TheKingMonkey,2,Wed Jun 24 17:49:09 2015 UTC,I'm surprised its only a return journey of about 5 mins.   How is it powered? Surely that flywheel can't get it through the day?
WaitingForATrain,3axqpq,TheKingMonkey,3,Fri Jun 26 22:16:36 2015 UTC,"It's the shortest branch line in Europe as far as I'm aware.  It really only still exists because it's in the West Midlands PTE so it gets subsidised by the taxpayer.    As for how it's powered, I'm not 100% sure on this but I've caught the damn thing enough times and I have been paid good money to do railway related work at Stourbridge Jn as recently as last week so I've got a little bit of experience. In fact if this picture was taken on the day it was submitted then I was actually on the station at the same time.    The line has a steady downhill gradient towards Stourbridge Town station so it can coast most of the way once the flywheel gets the thing moving and the line speed is 20 mph throughout so it doesn't use much juice.  The PPM will run out of electricity at some point, obviously, but there is a two litre diesel engine from a Ford Mondeo on board.  That's connected to a generator which charges a battery which the flywheel and electrical motor can tap into."

In recent years, the depot had been serving as a rather run down storage building and tack shop, so it is welcome to see the current maintenance levels.   Historically, the station was a primary (though not terminal) stop of the famed Del Monte Express, a daily train from San Francisco to Monterey that was among the earliest of named trains in America, running between 1889 and 1971, when it died on A-Day.   Today, though no passengers have boarded at Monterey since 1971, and no trains at all have run here since the early 1980s, the right of way is in public ownership and there are unfunded plans to restore the corridor to service as a diesel light rail line"

The Center sits atop a hill connected to a visitors' parking garage at the bottom of the hill by a three-car, cable-pulled hovertrain funicular.  Located in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, the Center is one of two locations of the J. Paul Getty Museum and draws 1.3 million visitors annually. (The other location is the Getty Villa in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.) The Center branch of the Museum features pre-20th-century European paintings, drawings, illuminated manuscripts, sculpture, and decorative arts; and 19th- and 20th-century American, Asian, and European photographs.  In addition, the Museum’s collection at the Center includes outdoor sculpture displayed on terraces and in gardens and the large Central Garden designed by Robert Irwin. Among the artworks on display is the Vincent Van Gogh painting Irises.  Designed by architect Richard Meier, the campus also houses the Getty Research Institute (GRI), the Getty Conservation Institute, the Getty Foundation, and the J. Paul Getty Trust. The Center's design included special provisions to address concerns regarding earthquakes and fires.    Image i     Interesting: J.

WaitingForATrain,341nhq,alexfrancisburchard,4,Mon Apr 27 17:00:14 2015 UTC,Almost all deep level tube stations (as opposed to sub surface tube stations) have suicide pits in them - the idea is that if someone jumps (or is pushed) they go into the pit rather than getting trapped under the train. It doesn't always work but it improves the odds of survival.

It was installed a couple of years back when the WCML was closed out of Euston the weekend Crufts was on at the National Exhibition Centre and Chiltern ran additional trains to Birmingham International.  I guess the theory was that the extra dogs are probably going to want to do their business somewhere so all trains to International went from five and six and a giant ""litter tray"" was built in a relatively out of the way location.

The new Scotrail franchise may use HSTs when they are displaced from the East Coast, so some of the trains may get the modifications yet."

I don't share /u/crucible's expectation that the modifications to comply with access requirements will prove prohibitive. I'll be surprised if most of the fleet doesn't stay in use with other franchises."
WaitingForATrain,32d6ig,vln,2,Mon Apr 13 14:54:38 2015 UTC,"my perception of that being unusually old is probably another case of the ""North American Railroad Regulations makes things suck"", given that  the replacement for the 23 year old GE Genesis locomotives are already in the early stages of construction. Older power has mostly been rebuilt and sold to commuter agencies.   The flip side of that being that the cars keep on trucking forever"
WaitingForATrain,32d6ig,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,2,Mon Apr 13 16:45:16 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of recycling of stock in this way in the UK, too. New freight locomotives are always on order, with the older ones being passed down to secondary use. There's loads of Class 47s still chugging around, and even some Class 20s (their main duty is now with nuclear fuel/waste trains).  Similarly, passenger stock often gets replaced within 20 years, with the older ones passing to secondary duties. Hence HSTs freed up from cross-country services now in use with East Midland Trains, and the trains replaced by Pendolinos on the WCML now operate in East Anglia.  That said, if it hadn't been for the lack of electrification out of Paddington and north of Edinburgh, I suspect HSTs would have been replaced on those routes much earlier. In particular, the GWR would almost certainly have been electrified by now, if it hadn't been for the paralysis of innovation which existed from the late 1980s onwards due to impending privatisation, and other 125mph diesel trains would have been put into service much sooner than happened. (Am I right in thinking that the HSTs were the only diesels regularly running at that speed until the Class 220 Voyagers were introduced?)"
WaitingForATrain,32d6ig,vln,2,Mon Apr 13 17:24:47 2015 UTC,"Any power roaming the rails on this side of the atlantic of the 50s-60s is almost certainly not in regular revenue service and is probably a tourist or excursion train. The oldest regular passenger power you'll likely encounter would be F-40 units likely purchased from Amtrak in the last few decades and re-engined. The very oldest F-40s would be 40, but most of the units still in service are probably much younger. Amtrak even de-engines some of them to use as Cab-Baggage 'cabbages'.  Electrics have lasted longer, with the AEM-7 on their way out between 27 and 37 years old.   On the other hand, those stainless steel VIA coaches I linked to were built in the mid 1950s and run daily service, with VIA expecting to be able to maintain them indefinitely into the future. Most Amtrak rolling stock is from mid 1970s or early 1980s orders, with no replacement plans put forward yet for Superliner or Amfleet replacements.   As for British Diesels timelines, I don't know."

The irony here is that the HST was so good that there was no need to continue with a rolling proigramme of electrification after the West Coast and even the East Coast lines were completed.   Now we're playing catch up in my opinion. We're only now starting electrification work on routes like the Great Western, South Wales Main Line and Midland Main Line. Which would have been done decades ago in most other European countries.   In particular, the GWR would almost certainly have been electrified by now, if it hadn't been for the paralysis of innovation which existed from the late 1980s onwards due to impending privatisation   BR practically had to fight the Thatcher Government in the 1980s to be allowed to spend its own money and electrify the East Coast Main Line. I doubt provitisation stopped any further electrification programmes.

As for the ECML, every time high winds damage overhead cables, you can blame Thatcher: penny-pinching forced the design to use larger spans between supports than was ideal.

That's a fair point.

Yeah there was an energy crisis in the 70s but was there no political and financial will to get stuff off the roads and on to rail?  We seem to be very good at interim measures: Deltics, the HST was only supposed to be a stopgap until the APT was ready, we're now getting 'bi-mode' electro-diesel SETs.   As for the ECML, every time high winds damage overhead cables, you can blame Thatcher: penny-pinching forced the design to use larger spans between supports than was ideal.   I was reading somewhere the other day that Network Rail have some new lightweight span for supporting the wires across two tracks that is much more robust and will be installed on the ECML going forward. I can't find a link now though.   Looming privatisation certainly did kill off all sorts of long-term planning and development - and research.   The research department in Derby was one of the world's leading centres for railway R & D in the 1960s and early 1970s I believe.

BR had to flog the embryonic tilting technology overseas, rather than continuing to develop it into a commercially-viable model. We could have been selling Pendolinos across Europe...   Agreed. The way APT was killed off at the prototype stage still annoys me. Couldn't have put it better myself. Yeah, the railways are a global market now but BR designed locos like the 58 and 60 were quickly sidelined come privatisation and the 68s are the first non-EMD loco purchase by a railfreight company in something like 20 years. Meanwhile Hitachi must be laughing all the way to the bank with the IEP specification.   With the specifics of electrification, we could play what-if games all day long, but wires up to Aberdeen were certainly considered, and even if the HSTs were too good to justify electrifying the GWR, a properly-run railway would have joined up various gaps. Peterborough to Ely, for example, which would provide a diversion for ECML trains when the southern stretch is closed.   BR was being pretty well run when it was sold off though. There were clear business sectors and Intercity were running more trains at over 100mph daily than many European nations - and making a profit, too.  Yes, we can play electrification what-if, but the gaps you mention as being suitable for wiring are only being considered for electrification now.  Maybe I can look forward to cascaded 170s on my local line in 15 years or so, with electrification as part of Merseyrail having been turned down once again on cost grounds..."

There was an energy crisis, but it was also when North Sea oil fields were being found. It was hard to sell electrification to politicians, let alone the electorate, when that was happening! The oil crisis was (hoped to be) short term, but electrification (as with renewables today) was something which would only show any benefits ten or more years from now, with the full return on investment being decades away.  This was doubly problematic when we still had a pioneering train to be proud of. (The gas turbine APT-E fits into this context, too.)   We seem to be very good at interim measures: Deltics, the HST was only supposed to be a stopgap until the APT was ready, we're now getting 'bi-mode' electro-diesel SETs.

Scotrail want to take a fleet of HSTs from 2018 (I struggle to see how the timing of IEP introduction and HST refurbishment / cascade will work there but that's another matter entirely!)  Accessibility isn't the only issue that needs sorting on HSTs though. The toilets would need upgrading to have retention tanks, the alternators and traction motors on the power cars will probably need a good overhaul soon and finally there's the thorny question of trying to retro-fit ETCS to a fleet of 40 year old trains come the end of the decade.

Electrification is limited to rapid transit projects and a couple of commuter lines through a tunnel in Montreal,  but we could get a hell of a lot more bang-for-buck for the rest of our diesel powered passenger rail if we could get more of the trains up to their 90-110 mph design speeds more of their time on the line.

WaitingForATrain,32d6ig,edgeorge92,1 point,Wed Apr 15 08:32:11 2015 UTC,"IMO the GNER pre-1999 livery was the best post-privatisation livery, but it is hard to produce an attractive livery which complies with the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations (which require contrasting door colours - the Chiltern blue and white was probably the best compliant livery).  Still, I would have used the pretendolino livery used on the WCML, rather than that one, which is rather ugly (although it is still better than some of the horrible 90s liveries)."

WaitingForATrain,32d6n2,vln,2,Mon Apr 13 15:41:57 2015 UTC,"For me it's the more angular design of the Class 91 that makes it look dated, compare it to the HST in the other thread.

WaitingForATrain,32d6n2,crucible,2,Mon Apr 13 19:02:47 2015 UTC,"I agree that 91's look outdated. I can't help think the livery doesn't do it much justice though. Especially the yellow at the front, presumably thats a safety thing and not an aesthetic choice? If the front was completely red, it would have looked much nicer"
WaitingForATrain,32d6n2,edgeorge92,2,Wed Apr 15 08:28:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah the 91 would look better if the front was red.  The yellow colour scheme on the front of trains in the UK dates back to the 1960s or so.  When electric locomotives were first introduced they looked like this. Track maintenance crews complained because the trains were a lot less visible than the older steam trains.  So when British Rail drew up its corporate image, the 'Rail Blue' livery featured full yellow front ends on all trains.  In the 1980s the rules were relaxed and liveries like this featured less yellow on the front.  Today the rules governing the visibility of trains stipulate a minimum surface area of 1 metre square at the front must be painted yellow, leading to liveries like this.  Of course today most modern trains are built with LED headlights, and older stock is being retro-fitted with them during overhauls."

Lillooet is the northern terminus of the Kaoham Shuttle, a wee-little DMU train that runs south to Shalalth, Seton Portage, and occasionally D'Arcy.  Prior to the end of BC Rail passenger service in 2002, Budd DMU trains ran from North Vancouver through the area to Lillooet and Prince George. Communities along Seton and Anderson Lake, unlike most of the rest of the route, are very isolated outside the railroad. It was seen as necessary for the that a minimal amount of passenger service be retained after BC Rail was sold to CN. Trains run six days per week (and on Friday if enough tickets have been sold) between Seton Portage and Lillooet, and intermittently to D'Arcy  Today, the route is operated as a partnership between CN and the Tsal'alh Band."

Under what circumstances do they switch the power off past a certain point, and why?"
WaitingForATrain,2uviyh,SRPToronto,5,Sun Feb 8 22:19:19 2015 UTC,"The power is switched off during engineering hours. Engineering hours are times where the entire underground is shut and this time varies depending on the last timetabled train to pass an area. The cutting of juice allows workers to safely go on track and do their works.   The loco I was on is a battery locomotive which does not need juice to run and can hence run while there are workers on the track for them to utilise the use of this train. The posted picture however was taken after the works for the night have been completed and the train was waiting for its timetabled slot back to West Ruislip depot. In this case we had to wait a while after the timetabled slot (which is a time before the first passenger train of the day) because of late handback further down the line.   It is not ideal to run this battery locomotive train on batteries on a section of track which doesn't have juice as it can be a safety hazard for any remaining people or plant on the track and that this degrades the battery quite a bit, especially the route we took that night because there are a number of steep climbs the train has to do. Also running past a lit cherry can energise the section behind or in front of the train as it can gap it, potentially powering up a section of track that isn't supposed to be juiced up again putting safety of workers in danger."

It's only got four platforms, only two of those are through platforms and the only one of the two north facing bays can access both northbound exits from the station (towards Warwick or towards Coventry) so I consider the layout to be quite restrictive given the level of service the place gets.    It would be much better if there were four through platforms but it's virtually impossible to do (ie, prohibitively expensive) as the entire station is elevated above the town centre."
WaitingForATrain,2t5ipw,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,1 point,Mon Jan 26 21:44:49 2015 UTC,"For scale, this is what they're building right now in San Francisco. the new Transbay Terminal, lauded as the 'Grand Central Station of the West', and it's only being built for six platforms.  Jack London Square, the central station for Oakland across the bay from SF, has two platforms.   Relatively few cities have any commuter rail service, and  there are significant cities which lack rail service at all, places like Phoenix which has 4.3 million people and no intercity or commuter service.  If a city has any rail service, outside the North East Corridor, it's quite likely to be a train-a-day Amtrak long distance route, or perhaps a few state supported trains. This site has maps of every American railroad passenger service operating today.   At one time, of course, there was an abundance of passenger service, but after that went away, a lot of the now surplus station capacity in significant cities was removed because level platforms and platform bridges restricted loading gauge of passing freight.  You had places like Cincinnati Union Terminal, which today has a single platform for the 6 trains a week that pass through after midnight, with the original platform bridges being torn out to accommodate double-stack containers.    So that's the environment - not a lot of train service, and historical capacity being removed because it was both surplus to requirements and actively interfering in profitable railroading"

We were the first in the world to build a network and it was built at a time when the UK was the richest and most powerful country on the planet so we kinda had more money than we knew what to do with so the railway was built in a grand and spectacular fashion, even in smaller parts of the country.  Some of that has gone but what remains is still very impressive (places like London St Pancras, Paddington, Bristol Temple Meads) but of course a lot of it is 150+ years old now and showing it's age.    The San Francisco terminal looks like something which might pop up in London as a Crossrail station, but it would be one of many rather than a focal point.      You look at somewhere in London which is crazy like Clapham Junction to see what would be considered busy here.  The departure board is ridiculous.

In the case if San Francisco, the station is arguably under-built. It is much closer to the downtown than the current terminal, and is generally expected to attract more commuters. Then you tack in the new high speed line to Los Angeles planned to take up 3/4 of the platforms, future services planned to run into San Francisco from points South, and the potential for a new tunnel under the bay at some point, which would redirect a huge amount of connecting traffic, and the terminal seems to be less than current, much less future needs"

The rather stroad like arterials surrounding it on two sides and disused rail spur on another make it somewhat inaccessible.   Lastly featured is a shot of the platform of the disused 'Olympic Line', a tram line converted from the False creek connector some years ago, which once temporarily connected Main Street-Science World and Granville Island. During the olympics, it hosted a demonstration bombardier light rail vehicle, and for some years hosted a historic-society run historic trolley run in the summer, though it wasn't a terribly useful service and the city ceased supporting it a few years ago.    Light-rail fanatics will tell you that this was a plot against light-rail, but the reality of the matter is that there isn't that much demand along the corridor this old rail line served.

In the old images the platform is medium wide, tracks look like they are broad (I believe they are/were), the tunnel seems to be the same diameter as the size of the platforms and the gradient of the westbound approach (heading east) looks all wrong.   In reality the platforms look wide (no modifications could be done to the walls either side without destroying the history), the tunnel looks narrow, not able to hold broad gauge tracks and the gradient on the westbound approach (heading east) is so steep down that the signaling system has to force the trains to slow down, if not stop, to approach the station; there's even a trainstop 3/4 the way down the eastbound platform.

WaitingForATrain,2qqlhq,Lol-I-Wear-Hats,2,Tue Dec 30 03:27:33 2014 UTC,"Basical layman's answer, there were certain national rail routes/franchises which were severely underperforming (North London Line / Silverlink) so TfL was able to ""capture"" them and buff up the service to proper standards.    New rolling stock, stations cleaned up and staffed, unified branding/wayfinding/etc, improved frequencies, and so on.  Since then they have added several more routes to the system including a few strategic bits of building to (re)connect bits of track so as to achieve a full orbital loop around zone 2-3 ish.   So, it's part of the general rail network, but managed by TFL as opposed to some Network Rail concessionaire?   In terms of governance if you want to be really technical about it, it's actually quite distinctive.  In apparently the same way that National Rail franchises are actually run by private sector bidders like Arriva or Virgin, to National Rail's specifications, the Overground is run by a LOROL which is a joint venture of Arriva and MTR (the Hong Kong metro operator), to TfL's specifications.  However the details of the contracts are different, the Overground is run as a 'concession' rather than a 'franchise'.  I'm not an expert, but it has something to do with TfL bearing more of the financial risk, and in return being able to specify the specified required service levels in a different way, and enforce them more meaningfully, or something.  As far as I can tell the gist of it is that the passenger tends to gets a better service -- so I hope NR franchises are switched to this model in future!

WaitingForATrain,2qqlhq,alex17595,2,Tue Dec 30 22:05:45 2014 UTC,"Indeed.  While the coverage areas are comparatively spartan, passenger rail service in the United States is almost entirely owned by various levels of government. Amtrak, which is a de-facto public corporation controlled by the Federal Government operates the Boston-New York-Philadelphia-Washington 'Northeast Corridor' at a profit, and those profits, along with Federal contributions fund long distance routes over 750 miles (like New York-Chicago or Seattle-Los Angeles). Amtrak contracts service to State governments to operate routes under 750 miles (like New York-Buffalo, or Seattle-Portland), and commuter services and more local routes are managed by state and local governments. Most cities lack commuter rail services, though this has been changing of late  The physical rails are mostly owned by the seven big railroads, like Union Pacific, CSX, Canadian National or Norfolk Southern, though Amtrak owns the North East Corridor and many local governments own much of their commuter rail trackage. The railroads are oriented towards moving the massive amounts of freight that American railroads move, and passenger service is mostly seen as a nuisance by them.    As a whole I'd say the system works. Amtrak has become an increasingly efficient operator in recent decades, and they're services are increasingly popular, even if they only see 30 million riders in a year.  Commuter services are increasingly popular as well  Here's an amtrak route diagram  here's a diagram of NY commuter services"

Of course there are some days where things go to hell (like last weekend's chaos) but usually it's ok.  With that sentence I meant more specifically the way governance and management happens behind the scenes, like the West Coast franchise bungle, and on a deeper level, things like the way ROCs are dis-incentivised to invest in long-term upgrades as they may not have the franchise by the time the investment generates a return, or how if my local ROC is terrible I have no way of voting with my feet/wallet, etc."

The station opened on 1 March 1909 with the opening of the original section of line 6 from Place d'Italie to Nation (although part of line 5—some dating back to 2 October 1900—was incorporated into line 6 on 12 October 1942). It is named after the Quai de la Gare on the south bank of the Seine, which was a wharf opened in 1770 and serving the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. Nearby was the location of the Barrière de la Gare, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished in 1819.  Nearby are the Ministry of Finance and Palais omnisports de Paris-Bercy.

Before his presidency, he was the eighth Vice President (1833–1837) and the tenth secretary of state (1829–1831), both under Andrew Jackson.  Van Buren was a key organizer of the Democratic Party, a dominant figure in the Second Party System, and the first president not of British or Irish descent—his family was Dutch. He was the first president to have been born a United States citizen,  since all of his predecessors were born British subjects before the American Revolution.  He is the only president not to have spoken English as his first language, having grown up speaking Dutch,  and the first president from New York.  As Andrew Jackson's Secretary of State and then Vice President, Van Buren was a key figure in building the organizational structure for Jacksonian democracy, particularly in New York. As president, he did not want the United States to annex Texas, an act which John Tyler would achieve eight years after Van Buren's initial rejection. Between the bloodless Aroostook War and the Caroline Affair, relations with Britain and its colonies in Canada also proved to be strained.

They are staffed and operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers. Travelers pass through Immigration and Customs, Public Health, and Department of Agriculture inspections before boarding their aircraft, ship or train. This process is intended to streamline border procedures, to reduce congestion at ports of entry, and to facilitate travel between the preclearance location and some U.S. airports that may not be equipped to handle international travellers. However, the US and other countries who engage in the practice have been accused of being motivated also by the desire to prevent the arrival of asylum seekers, who are protected under the 1951 Refugee Convention's non-refoulement provisions once they arrive at their destination.

The original station was built in 1867 by the Midland Railway on the extension of its Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway which became its main line to London from Manchester. Originally, the Midland had planned to extend through Buxton, but the LNWR already had a line, so the Midland built a line through Chinley and Buxworth to join the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway at New Mills, in an association which became known as the Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies' Committee.  From Millers Dale the line crossed the Black Brook valley at Chapel Milton. This became a double viaduct when the Dore and Chinley line was built in 1894, with a north curve forming a triangular junction.

Twice daily service on a slow running line shared with mile long freight trains. I love the service on Amtrak compared to driving. I work for an airline actually, so I fly a lot, but If I have the time I'd much prefer the train for service and comfort here.  There has been a lot of interest in building a new intercity rail network with high speed trains but the political climate is frosty for large new spending projects. HSR in California is having a tough time getting the first rail laid, and projects in the northeast are plagued by high land values and antiquated existing infrastructure.  There are a lot of other issues why Americans don't ride trains as much, but probably the biggest reason is that most of our cities are just too far apart for conventional rail to be a competitive mode of passenger transport when its competing with cargo trains. Generally speaking, places with high population density have better rail service. The UK is extremely dense compared to the USA, that is my personal hypothesis at least, though as I said, there are a bunch of reasons."

WaitingForATrain,22btr5,scared_little_girl,2,Fri Apr 11 01:15:08 2014 UTC,"Football matches are great fun, even if you're not that into football. If you can get to an English Premier League game then they atmosphere will be electric. There will be 70k people packed into a stadium all singing the same songs, cheering, shouting and all sorts.  The difference is that German football is 10x more intense and 10x louder. In English football if the opposition team scores your fans usually shut up for a bit. There are times when the stadium will be nearly silent. In a good game where the home team is winning this won't be often. But if the home team is losing, or if its a bit of a dull game then there will be times it goes quiet.  At the Dortmund game the fans never shut up. When Wolfsburg scored first there was silence for about 30 seconds then the fans piped up twice as loud as before.  Whenever there is a foul or a free kick near Dortmund's goal the whole stadium starts whistling. 70k people all whistling at once sounds absolutely awesome. I can't imagine how scary it is for an away team to play at Dortmund with 70,000 fans all whistling and shouting at you. I'm sure that the fans contribute to their success.  I think its testament to how the fans are treated as well. I follow Ipswich Town who are in the English Championship League (Premiership is the first league, for the best teams (and Norwich) and the Championship League is the next league down). A season ticket costs about £600. At Dortmund (currently 2nd in the German Bundesliga - the German equivalent of the English Premiership) you can get a similar season ticket for £300! That's half the cost for a technically much better side.  Plus when you're waiting for the game to start the way that they pump you up and get you excited really gets the crowd going. They play very emotive songs with the words replaced with the team's name. They show montage clips of the team winning and it really gets the adrenaline going before the match. I've never seen that happen at English games, its all a bit more stately.  I hope that goes some way to understanding the difference. :)"

WaitingForATrain,21yf9t,vln,1 point,Wed Apr 2 17:17:45 2014 UTC,"Yep. Islands also offer more limited options for building entrances. They tend to end up having stairs at either end, which means that when the platform is crowded, people are trying to work their way past those waiting for a different train.  Including step-free access is a bigger issue, too, with a lift shaft potentially becoming another problematic barrier when the platform is busy.

(The photo is from 5 years ago and I hadn't taken any notes, I had to flick through Google Maps to make sure I had the correct station.)   The train pictured here is a 700 series train operating a Nozomi service that came through the station while we were waiting for our train (JR Pass holders are not able to board this class of service as it is intended for business travellers).  During the week were stayed in Osaka, we also went on day trips using the Shinkansen (free travel with JR Pass) to Himeji and Hiroshima.  As for riding in the train itself? To be honest, it was almost unremarkable. It was quiet, with a smooth and comfortable ride and airline-esque reclinable seating (except it had actual leg room, even for a tall-ish foreigner). The only way you would know the train was travelling at 285+ km/h or special in any way would be by looking out the window."

WaitingForATrain,212mdw,androidgirl,1 point,Sun Mar 23 01:02:33 2014 UTC,I miss the Tokyo Metro. Chiyoda line!!!
WaitingForATrain,212a6k,scared_little_girl,1 point,Sat Mar 22 07:33:34 2014 UTC,Nice signage.  Do the trains run when it gets insanely cold? SEPTA in Philly kind of seizes up when it dips below 20 degrees. The new Silverliners are a nice ride but the doors weren't intended for ought but a sunny day.
WaitingForATrain,212a6k,nmac_mpls,3,Sat Mar 22 10:26:19 2014 UTC,I was on the METRO Blue Line this frigged morning and the train was running like normal. The train has a nice feature where the doors don't open at stations unless a button on the door is pressed. This helps to keep the inside warm since there is a stop almost every two minutes on the route.
WaitingForATrain,212a6k,scared_little_girl,3,Sat Mar 22 15:23:42 2014 UTC,"Yep, we had full service on light rail and buses even one day when it was -22.  The commuter trains tend to get bogged down though, mostly because they share tracks with freight trains and those have to go slower in cold weather, or something like that.  Snowstorms, on the other hand, will really impact bus service, and the light rail tends to get some delays, but it keeps running.  I don't think it's ever been entirely shut down for snowstorms."
WaitingForATrain,21270o,wzhkevin,1 point,Sat Mar 22 06:25:03 2014 UTC,Tack! I can see the 2:17 is right on time.  Where were you going? Do you commute by train every day?
WaitingForATrain,21270o,scared_little_girl,1 point,Sat Mar 22 10:21:50 2014 UTC,I was on exchange in Stockholm at the time. Had a student apartment at Flemingsberg. That's probably where i was headed. Yup. Everyday.
WaitingForATrain,211ghb,cl1352,1 point,Sat Mar 22 00:12:56 2014 UTC,Thank you for the x-post. These are wonderful.
WaitingForATrain,211ghb,scared_little_girl,1 point,Sat Mar 22 00:40:51 2014 UTC,So many tracks. I love this station.
WaitingForATrain,211koo,macroclimate,1 point,Sat Mar 22 01:04:59 2014 UTC,Is this line open already?
WaitingForATrain,211koo,vanisaac,2,Sat Mar 22 04:15:21 2014 UTC,"Yeah, this station is on Central Link, which has been in service since 2009. The extension to the U District via Capitol Hill is opening in 2016."
WaitingForATrain,211koo,scared_little_girl,1 point,Sat Mar 22 05:08:17 2014 UTC,Is that giant weird glowing purple thing art or is it doing something?  I wish Philly could have more nice things in their stations. We're not to be trusted with nice things. Someone usually takes a leak on them.
WaitingForATrain,211koo,richardjohn,2,Sat Mar 22 10:32:42 2014 UTC,"Haha yeah, it's just art. The whole station is sort of decked out like some undersea scene, so there are lots of weird sea creature-looking things hanging from the ceiling."
WaitingForATrain,2112ug,strcrssd,2,Fri Mar 21 21:39:13 2014 UTC,Great pic. I would love to see more Texas rail pictures.
WaitingForATrain,2112ug,nmac_mpls,2,Sat Mar 22 00:14:22 2014 UTC,"I've posted one other so far, the other side of my daily commute."
WaitingForATrain,2112ug,scared_little_girl,1 point,Sat Mar 22 00:56:33 2014 UTC,It might sound boring to you but I'd be happy to see a new photo each day from both ends. I was hoping folks would use this sub as a daily photo journal. The different days and nights and weather make each one a meaningful variation on a theme.
WaitingForATrain,2112ug,scared_little_girl,1 point,Sat Mar 22 10:35:21 2014 UTC,"Thank you, This has the excellent lonesome platform feeling i so love.  Where were you going? Where were you coming from?"
WaitingForATrain,2112tq,scared_little_girl,2,Fri Mar 21 21:38:59 2014 UTC,looks like their shed roof needs some maintenance
WaitingForATrain,2112tq,vanisaac,1 point,Fri Mar 21 23:15:05 2014 UTC,"Hah.  Septa actually did a complete station overhaul a few years back, cleaned the place up nicely (it'd been a wreck but the part of town it's in has 'come up in the world' so I guess they figured it ws time) and just took off most the platform canopy. There's still plenty of covered space and I like the way the remaining beams look, like the bones of some long dead creature, remaining in place as mute testament to way of life which no longer is and perhaps never was."
WaitingForATrain,20y5wl,nmac_mpls,1 point,Thu Mar 20 23:23:05 2014 UTC,This is the functional but not very friendly Montrose CTA station in the center of the Kennedy expressway. I don’t usually use this station but on this day I had to connect to a metra train that was a few blocks away.

WaitingForATrain,20xchk,lucasjv,2,Fri Mar 21 05:12:15 2014 UTC,"Yah, they still run a lot of those old trains here too. I took a picture in another station and put it on this sub with one of those. The newer Regionova however is much, much more comfortable."
WaitingForATrain,20xwg6,nmac_mpls,1 point,Thu Mar 20 21:51:10 2014 UTC,Thank you! This is what I was hoping for! What station is this? Where were you going?   Please post again even if it's the same station. I'm hoping to see the seasons creep Around and around as we all wait for our trains.  But also I'd love to see more CTA stations.
WaitingForATrain,20xwg6,scared_little_girl,2,Thu Mar 20 22:14:34 2014 UTC,"This is the California station on the O'hare branch of the CTA blue line. The station was original constructed in 1895 and is set for a major overhaul during the next four years as part of Chicago transits ""renew blue"" project. I just moved to Chicago and I will post some more CTA pics."

WaitingForATrain,20wg6z,scared_little_girl,1 point,Fri Mar 21 10:04:31 2014 UTC,Wow! Thank you.   Do passengers wait on the edge of the yards or actually between tracks?
WaitingForATrain,20wg6z,scared_little_girl,2,Thu Mar 20 22:17:53 2014 UTC,"There is a station enclosure before track 1. Passengers generally wait there but since I am always transferring through this station I just walk directly to my train. Sometimes people are waiting between tracks though, but you aren't really supposed to."

WaitingForATrain,20uer0,scared_little_girl,2,Thu Mar 20 00:49:46 2014 UTC,I was curious how well SLC's light rail worked and had no particular destination in mind.  I wound up going downtown then taking it all the way to the university.  Draper area maybe? It was the furthest station to the south that was open (although there was a significant extension that was nearly complete at that time that had yet to open).
