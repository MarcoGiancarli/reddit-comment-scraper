With a little houseruling they could function just fine as Stand users (I've done it in regular games before to hilarious effect).   I would recommend doing something about making stand powers a little more prevalent as you go this route such as incorporating free Eldritch Heritage feats for the Stands themselves."

StardustCrusaders,3e4856,huzaifa96,12,Tue Jul 21 20:52:24 2015 UTC,"Most of the entire series isn't even available for Western fans legally; Part One is just now coming out in manga format for us to read and purchase, while Part Three had been available previously (and they're not even available in color, so anyone who wants to read the colorized manga has to look for fan translations). For anyone who wants to read the rest of the series, we have to rely on fan translations, though most of us still support the series and its creator by purchasing merchandise.  We don't endorse pirated anime, as it's available legally, and that's why we don't list it (if you look in our sidebar, we link only to Crunchyroll)."

StardustCrusaders,3e4856,SlimeStack,7,Tue Jul 21 21:40:08 2015 UTC,Because there's 90 or so volumes that haven't been released in English? I buy everything I can of JoJo (I even have a couple of Japanese volumes) but it's obvious that the main reason for all the piracy is the fact that you simply can't buy 90% of the franchise in English. Anyone who uses legal channels for the first three parts (or will be once Viz finishes releasing 1 and 2) then reads fan translations for the rest is doing just fine in my books.
StardustCrusaders,3e4856,levilee207,3,Tue Jul 21 21:06:32 2015 UTC,"Because iirc, Viz has only done parts 1-3. This leaves more than half of Jojo untranslated, unscanned, and unreadable for those who can't read Japanese. The more dedicated and knowledgeable fans put in blood, sweat, and tears to make the rest of Jojo enjoyable to everyone. However, I believe it is considered infringing copyright to do this without author permission (don't quote me on this), so we put things in Torrents or Mediafire (In InvincibleTrio's case). These ""illegal"" actions however have given Jojo much more publicity and the community has grown as a result. Until mid-2014, Part 4 (Diamond is Unbreakable), didn't have an actual full scale translation. All we had were Duwang. But the lovely fellows at InvincibleTrio took time out of their lives to bring Part 4 to English readers.  Tl;Dr, It technically is illegal, but do you really want Jojo to not be available to everyone?"

StardustCrusaders,3dwmce,cluckay,8,Mon Jul 20 05:06:01 2015 UTC,"Er, right. I totally knew that.   There is always the possibility of it not happening, though. I would not enjoy that."
StardustCrusaders,3dwmce,Zangam,25,Mon Jul 20 05:09:08 2015 UTC,"I feel like English VAs would bug the shit out of me, since they would be using the altered names like the infamous ""Filfthy Acts at a Reasonable Price"" and it would only really delay the time at which the game arrives to us anyhow."
StardustCrusaders,3dwmce,Delret51,25,Mon Jul 20 05:35:22 2015 UTC,"Filthy Acts at a Reasonable Price is hilarious imo. Does that bother people? That one does its best to stay true to the source, unlike some shittier ones like ""Zipperman"", ""Six Bullets"", ""Smack"" or ""lil Bomber""."
StardustCrusaders,3dwmce,Bobthemightyone,7,Mon Jul 20 08:40:17 2015 UTC,"It's hilarious, sure, but it's really awkward and directly contradicts ""D4C"".  But when it comes down to it, it was just an example."
StardustCrusaders,3dwmce,Delret51,14,Mon Jul 20 08:44:44 2015 UTC,Because getting a VA to yell FAAARP is both dumb sounding and hilarious at the same time
StardustCrusaders,3dwmce,OmegaXis8009,2,Mon Jul 20 12:04:57 2015 UTC,I shouted this to confirm and it is both hilarious and ridiculous.
StardustCrusaders,3dwmce,MrOneHundredOne,11,Mon Jul 20 19:41:58 2015 UTC,"I know this isn't your point, but ""Filthy Act at a Reasonable Price"" wasn't D4C's name in All Star Battle. D4C's name was just the abbreviation D4C. ""Filthy Act at a Reasonable Price"" was just something he said at the beginning of battles to replace the full phrase ""Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheep"". To me, that was a joke by the translators that only Jojo's fans would get.  I actually don't mind a lot of the localized names, I mean you gotta do what you gotta do to not get sued. They really tried to keep true to the original by turning them into more obscure references (Although I still don't get Polnareff to Eiffel, or Echoes to Reverb). The exception being Part 5, where I think they just got lazy. I do hope they change the names for those Stands into more reasonable ones."
StardustCrusaders,3dwmce,ATB_WHSPhysics,4,Mon Jul 20 15:57:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah seriously I liked ""Filthy Acts at a Reasonable Price"" as a little reference to people who knew better."

I recommend doing what pretty much everybody else who fandubs does and removing the original audio entirely and re-mixing your own sound effects in with the original music. Your volume was a little wonky with Dio when he was falling as well.

What he wanted to say is that we, several(two and a half, to be precise) fans of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure have long envisioned a new arc of this glorious saga, created in best traditions of first three parts and with us as lead roles - because the only thing better than reading the masterfully crafted manga or watching the skillfully drawn animated adaptation is actually creating and living through such wondrous adventure ourselves! We have vaguely worked out the setting, it being the post-soviet 70-80's Russia, and several interesting stands, three most developed being ARYA, King&Jest and Cinema, but as always with this fandom, are open to suggestions and would warmly welcome anyone willing to participate - especially brave souls with developed Original Characters and those who might be ready to take up the uneasy task of a Storyteller! Do you think you are cool enough to start your own Bizzare Adventure?!"

As to the system - we have one in mind (a Fate RPG hack), but that is, ultimately, for the potential storyteller to decide. As well as when and where the game is set, I guess?  When - depends on the schedules of people that are interested."
StardustCrusaders,3dzqns,knightlybrigand,3,Mon Jul 20 22:49:22 2015 UTC,"Most probably we will play via Skype, using voicechat or text, and the question of ""when"" will be answered when we figure out the timezones of players and the Master and the hours during which we can gather together."

StardustCrusaders,3dwfqd,rock61920,16,Mon Jul 20 02:34:23 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly, I thought he was male off the bat. I guess it's because it didn't look like he had breasts despite his low-cut shirt?"
StardustCrusaders,3dwfqd,ultibman5000,8,Mon Jul 20 03:01:46 2015 UTC,Same. I was surprised to hear people thought he was a girl (well...a little surprised...).

The target is aware of the intense feelings coming over them, but is no sure where it comes from. 「Slave 4 U」 cannot force actions on the part of the target, but gets their will to bend enough that they are very prone to suggestion.

This is possible after 4 minutes of sustained conscious manipulation on the part of the user.   This stand also has the ability to use a small wire to garrote opponents, but using this will immediately break the lovestruck effect.  Appearance: A slender figure with a very pretty face, 「Slave 4 U」 has markings around its torso similar to a two piece swimsuit. This stand appears to have less sense of personal space than the user, often appearing directly in front of an adversary. It has what looks like a ponytail, but it is not hair.

StardustCrusaders,3dr0vz,ArabiaFats,4,Sat Jul 18 17:27:06 2015 UTC,"You'd know what would be a pretty cool naming convention? If the stands names were both references to western music, AND the Tarot. For example, let's say if there was a new stand to represent the Wheel of Fortune card, it'd be called ""Wheel in the Sky""."
StardustCrusaders,3dr0vz,AlphaBenson,2,Sat Jul 18 21:37:21 2015 UTC,Star Platinum is already a reference to a Mike Olfield instrumental.
StardustCrusaders,3dr0vz,ChronicRedhead,2,Sat Jul 18 21:48:59 2015 UTC,"Araki ran out of colours pretty quick so he just kept things simple when he got to Dio. He also might have thought ""The World"" had a simple intensity that changing the name would take away."

The name for DIO's stand is THE WORLD because that card represents such things as ambition and stuff. There's also the fact that the four beasts around the centerpiece of the card represent something divine, which might be a reference to the translation of DIO's name which means god.   Here's some more info on it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_(Tarot_card)"

There's all kinds of cool stuff you can do, like take Avdol's place in the first Hol Horse fight. It's a bit basic and does include some amount of grinding, but I think it's worth the effort, and this is coming from someone who doesn't usually play JRPGs. It's also got a lot of references to other parts, like Kira and Diavolo as bonus bosses.  Here's a link.  PS: specials best"

StardustCrusaders,3drxcq,PikaCommando,4,Sat Jul 18 21:41:48 2015 UTC,What gave you the impression that Araki coloured them? They have teams at Shueisha that colour series like JoJo and One Piece.
StardustCrusaders,3drxcq,SlimeStack,0,Sat Jul 18 21:45:58 2015 UTC,What I mean by that is I've never heard of full-colored manga before. When did they start to colorize JoJo? Are they separate volumes or books or?
StardustCrusaders,3drxcq,SlimeStack,3,Sat Jul 18 21:55:39 2015 UTC,"No idea when they started, but they're digital exclusive (imagine how much 100+ volumes of full colour print manga would cost!). They're split into the same volumes as the original monochrome series except the start and end of each part is rearranged (e.g. the first couple of chapters of part 3 are in the same volume as part 2 in the original, but in the colour version they were moved to the next book)."
StardustCrusaders,3drxcq,SlimeStack,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:03:01 2015 UTC,Digital exclusive? So those are eBook versions or something? Where does one normally buy them?
StardustCrusaders,3drxcq,PilariousD,3,Sat Jul 18 22:10:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah they're eBooks. Kindle has them if you're willing to get around the region restrictions (it's not hard, just saying you'll have to do it), and I think Honto's eBook service also carries them. I'm sure lots of stores carry them."
StardustCrusaders,3drxcq,SlimeStack,2,Sat Jul 18 22:17:21 2015 UTC,It was for 25th anniversary. At first in 2012 they released parts 1 and 2 in digital stores. Soon after other parts showed up. Later first three parts in colored version were released as JoJonium.
StardustCrusaders,3drxcq,PilariousD,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:51:08 2015 UTC,"Not sure if I read this right or not but Jojonium most certainly is not full colour. Jojonium is the monochrome manga in hardback form with interviews and stuff. The only colour pages are the ones that Araki originally made when they were published in Weekly Shonen Jump, which are different to the pages in the full colour one."
StardustCrusaders,3drxcq,SlimeStack,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:02:45 2015 UTC,"I don't own any of JoJonium volumes (yet), but as it is said in the Internet: ""In 2012, the first three Parts of the series were digitally colored and released as digital downloads for smartphones and tablet computers. A physical version of this re-release was collected under the title JoJonium (ジョジョニウム Jojoniumu) beginning December 4, 2013.""  I don't know if american release is different than japanese."
StardustCrusaders,3drxcq,eigenwert,2,Sat Jul 18 23:09:50 2015 UTC,"Not sure which site that was, but it's wrong.  http://livedoor.blogimg.jp/jyojyo_soku/imgs/2/b/2baea931-s.jpg  It's really hard to find pictures of the inside of the book but you can see it's Jojonium by the cover."
StardustCrusaders,3drxcq,SlimeStack,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:18:05 2015 UTC,Are any parts other than 6 full colour?

StardustCrusaders,3dnxq8,King_Krabz,18,Fri Jul 17 20:30:01 2015 UTC,it may just be me but Jonathan on the cover looks nothing like the original. He looks more like Josuke8
StardustCrusaders,3dnxq8,Homer_Hatake,14,Fri Jul 17 20:53:13 2015 UTC,I suppose it's because of Araki's art style change. He probably just can't draw Jonathan the way he used to.
StardustCrusaders,3dnxq8,Hero-Sloth,19,Fri Jul 17 21:00:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's so much that he can't.  I think that Araki probably just thought it'd be cool to reimagine the old characters in his new style.  I quite like it personally, even if it doesn't really match the rest of the Phantom Blood art."
StardustCrusaders,3dnxq8,MetallicKaiser,20,Fri Jul 17 21:07:48 2015 UTC,"As he put it in Jojonium 3, ""If I wanted to draw him exactly as he was, I could, but characters are living things."""
StardustCrusaders,3dnxq8,Ahh_forget_about_it,16,Fri Jul 17 22:18:47 2015 UTC,Araki would say that.  What a crazy guy.
StardustCrusaders,3dnxq8,Xciv,14,Fri Jul 17 22:44:28 2015 UTC,"His interviews are sometimes as bizarre as his manga.  I love reading the little ""author's thoughts"" blurbs in his manga. His thought process is really absurd at times."
StardustCrusaders,3dnxq8,Ahh_forget_about_it,21,Sat Jul 18 02:46:55 2015 UTC,I like the one where he talks about how imagining someone calling him when he's not there to answer the phone gives him an existential crisis because the little red light blinking alone in the darkness is the saddest thing imaginable.
StardustCrusaders,3dnxq8,DioBlando,3,Sat Jul 18 02:52:53 2015 UTC,"Araki in true Rohan fashion puts the art above evrything. Yes it'd be awesome to see some new 'classic' JoJo art but the main thing that makes Araki great is he doesn't want to live in the past. The fact he keeps on moving forward is what made JoJo so good. More power to him, even if it does sometimes make people do a double take."
StardustCrusaders,3dnxq8,ATB_WHSPhysics,9,Sun Jul 19 15:48:15 2015 UTC,"He definitely can mimic his old style. The control artworks from ASB prove that. I really like these two, but for some of the later covers, I wish he made some of the characters look closer to the original."
StardustCrusaders,3dnxq8,BlastRose,2,Fri Jul 17 22:13:57 2015 UTC,"What artwork from ASB are you referring to? I don't have ASB, so I'm super curious."

StardustCrusaders,3dotz8,trashygray,10,Sat Jul 18 01:29:49 2015 UTC,Monster was pretty much shot-for-shot as well.
StardustCrusaders,3dotz8,The_Queen_in_Yellow,9,Sat Jul 18 04:45:59 2015 UTC,Hellsing Ultimate and FMA: Brotherhood are close to the manga.  But both the first hellsing series and FMA were super not like the manga.
StardustCrusaders,3dotz8,runnerofshadows,4,Sat Jul 18 07:35:03 2015 UTC,"Also if you like JoJo you'll love Hellsing: Ultimate. Hellsing is about super vampires and has a lot of musical references, and it's completely over-the-top violence. One of my favorite anime/manga."
StardustCrusaders,3dotz8,Nowhere_Man_Forever,2,Sat Jul 18 12:12:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely, both are heavily character driven, set in the real world and are based around tightly scripted character confrontations/battles. There's also some thematic similarities such as the Vampires so they're a good fit."
StardustCrusaders,3dotz8,DioBlando,13,Sun Jul 19 15:59:16 2015 UTC,Hunter x Hunter (2011) was pretty close as far as I remember. Shokugeki no Souma was also pretty close until the most recent episode where it skipped a mini-arc (they did it because the timing with it included would make the next arc cut in half or they'd need filler for the remaining episodes so it makes sense but skipped none-the-less. I'm reading through the Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso manga as it comes out here and after the 2nd volume it's still panel-for-panel but that might change. Usually unless I really like the story or I read the manga first I don't read the manga so I don't have very much under my belt and I'm probably not the best to answer this but HxH (2011) and Shigatsu are the closest I can think of.
StardustCrusaders,3dotz8,Doublethree1,15,Sat Jul 18 02:06:35 2015 UTC,it helps that Hunter x Hunter and Jojo's Bizarre Adventure are both ridiculously long-running manga and that the Hunter x Hunter anime ended cleanly on the manga's hiatus- lack of a fear of outpacing the manga or vice versa means that there's no filler and they can clean up/pack in more content in each season/episode
StardustCrusaders,3dotz8,LiteTheIronMan,7,Sat Jul 18 02:46:01 2015 UTC,"Hajime no Ippo is definitely an anime you should check out if you like Jojo! I was the person to hold off on this manga just because I don't like sports manga, and boxing sounds really lame. But I was wrong, this anime is amazing and very truthful to the manga. I wish I had started it earlier. Not to mention it's already achieved legendary status, and the manga is one of the longest running of all time, like Jojo."
StardustCrusaders,3dotz8,Von_Stroheim,3,Sat Jul 18 18:48:41 2015 UTC,Gintama is very close to the manga.

StardustCrusaders,3dotz8,Fruitspunch_Samurai,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:50:13 2015 UTC,"Nah, it has massive additions and arcs of complete filler. And the good type of filler, like the kind where they explain what filler is for a whole episode in the most comedic way possible."
StardustCrusaders,3dotz8,chadwaters,2,Sat Jul 18 11:07:49 2015 UTC,But the arcs occur in the manga though.
StardustCrusaders,3dotz8,Fruitspunch_Samurai,2,Sat Jul 18 11:52:55 2015 UTC,"Right now it's looking like Ushio to Tora is going that route. The issue is that most anime are made as promotional material for manga and LN's as they are being released so they don't have a full story to work with, leading to gaps in content, inconclusive endings, and filler."
StardustCrusaders,3dotz8,chadwaters,2,Sat Jul 18 11:10:24 2015 UTC,"Monster Musume is pretty close, but the anime censors parts."

StardustCrusaders,3dmyou,VicePresidentFruitly,4,Fri Jul 17 18:57:37 2015 UTC,Maybe it could do something like take the appearance of someone on the enemy team and be like a decoy?
StardustCrusaders,3dmyou,Bobbybutts,7,Fri Jul 17 19:00:26 2015 UTC,"Well, in that one PS2 game, Abbachio could record his own combos then have Moody Blues repeat them. That would be an awesome power, if not perhaps a little abuse-able. You can even expand it to record your opponent's combos or special moves as well, or create distractions by cloning yourself. I think Abbachio would make an amazing character, they just have to stray away from the source a little bit to make him work."

For part 4 characters i'd enjoy Mikitaka in some form and maybe highway star i'm sure they could work around those two to make them interesting.  Part 5 add Trish this time i feel she doesn't get enough love out of villains White Album and Metallica would be amazing love those two.  Part 6 Just add F.F and Weather Report (before regaining power) no more stands that would really translate well in this type of game  Part 7 Go crazy with the characters there are so many good stands and characters in part 7 : In a silent way , Mandom (obviously), Oyecomova and just add hot pants and Mountain Tim for fun.  Part 8 well im close to reaching the last current chapter but so far Just add Yasuho and i'd be satisfied"

StardustCrusaders,3dowx5,DaRedMage,2,Sat Jul 18 06:12:30 2015 UTC,That is a very good question! A few years back in 01 there was a tournament in the US that did. But its been so long since ive heard of the game being in a tournament that it might not due to the fact that Pet Shop is broke but need skill to for him to be unfair. As most people don't know how to use him in a unfair way. But hell of a good question and points to you for remembering that about him!

In reality, this is what happens:  [------------(mudamudamudamuda)--------]  During an instance of Za Warudo, everything that DIO does acts as it normally would, it's everything else that acts differently than normal.

StardustCrusaders,3dn6mf,Phob05,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:59:56 2015 UTC,really just moving around at all would create a nuclear reaction if time was stopped. dio finding out he could stop time should have began and ended with a mysterious nuclear blast in cairo
StardustCrusaders,3dn6mf,haymakers9th,4,Fri Jul 17 22:45:37 2015 UTC,"The more I see it come up, the more I think ""The World"" is a little more complex than just stopping time.  When DIO activates Za Warudo, he's functionally moving in a time frame infinitely faster than everything else. For all intents and purposes, time has stopped. But what about the air? DIO doesn't need it to breathe, but he does still have to move around. Taking into account basic physics, the air around DIO should create pressure pockets so massive due to what essentially amounts to infinite force. When time flows again, DIO should explode, but he doesn't. His knives should melt from friction, and basically everything should be dead. The result would be a little more akin to DIO setting off an atom bomb than slicing someone in half.  I think what happens is DIO's World is more akin to warping time infinitely than stopping it (I'm basing this on a realish scientific theory, and also maybe an episode of an internet show I like). As DIO gets close enough to touch something, it's pulled into the warped time, and as DIO gets further it's pushed out. I think this would also make sense of Jotaro being able to follow DIO, despite the fact that Jotaro didn't stop time simultaneously, yet moves after DIO gets close.  Or, you know, Anime Magic. Either one."
StardustCrusaders,3dn6mf,ibbolia,2,Fri Jul 17 20:31:19 2015 UTC,I'd chalk it up to anime magic.
StardustCrusaders,3dn6mf,YouLikeFlapjacks,3,Sat Jul 18 22:12:08 2015 UTC,"It's not really time stopping per se, it's more like freezing everything temporarily."
StardustCrusaders,3dn6mf,Urist_McGamer,3,Fri Jul 17 18:26:16 2015 UTC,It just works
StardustCrusaders,3dn6mf,levilee207,2,Sat Jul 18 03:52:47 2015 UTC,"When Dio stops time he's not stopping it completely, its stopping it for everyone except himself. During that short period of time he's still affected by physics the same way it is when time is flowing normally.   A better question would be asking how Dio affects his surroundings when he interacts with them during a time stop. When Dio threw knives at Jotaro and Joseph they dramatically stopped before they could make contact and when Dio first stopped time in front of Jotaro the parts of the cat and the people he knocked over stopped moving faster than if time wasn't stopped.  I think we can explain this as the entire universe being at a state of zero energy. When he interacts with something he is supplying force onto something with zero energy but because of The World's ability they are quickly slowed down until they have reached a complete stop again.   I guess you could say that Dio is actually the only person following the laws of physics when he stops time and everything else is constantly being drained of its force."

StardustCrusaders,3do8xn,Tholkor,16,Fri Jul 17 21:58:29 2015 UTC,"OVA? It's pretty un-recommendable. I'd advise watching it AFTER the new anime as it skips out way too much cool fights, and kinda screws up one of the most iconic moments towards the end of Jotaro VS DIO.  Give it a shot later.  Also they made a second OVA series that covered stuff from before the crusaders arrived in Egypt as well, (they just made it later on) so maybe you should finish the new anime, watch the Second OVA series, then watch the first one.  I'll search around for the subs of them for you, (If I remember)"
StardustCrusaders,3do8xn,PictoShark,4,Fri Jul 17 22:16:10 2015 UTC,"finish the anime, then go back and watch the n'doul, cream, and dio fights in the OVA. every other episode will just be the same thing you already watched but not as good, and with a lot of stuff missing and changed.  i personally really enjoyed the OVA, and even thought that those 3 fights were done BETTER in the OVA than the anime, but thats not exactly a widely held opinion (so you'd just have to see for yourself). the style is something that turns a lot of people off, so it's good that you like it. the style is a bit weird, but the animation is REALLY nice, imo. the basic main differences between the OVA and the anime is that the anime handles the humorous scenes better, while the OVA handles the serious scenes better."

StardustCrusaders,3dhzm9,Mopziii,2,Fri Jul 17 05:14:17 2015 UTC,Nice. Would you consider doing some of the other characters or even putting the design on redbubble (without the background colour so the shirt would look consistent)?

StardustCrusaders,3dhzm9,highestDIO,2,Thu Jul 16 18:32:29 2015 UTC,That looks great. Do you think you could make a version of that but with DIO and THE WORLD centered to the right and with a yellow background? Because that would be awesome.
StardustCrusaders,3dhzm9,Hero-Sloth,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:28:15 2015 UTC,Looks great!  Do you have any plans to do similar wallpapers for other characters?
StardustCrusaders,3dhzm9,LockedAndClush,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:41:53 2015 UTC,"That's really great, I love such simple, minimalist images.   Would that be exportable in a bigger resolution for you? If you don't mind, I'd love to use that on a poster/shirt (undecided yet), for my personal use, of course.   Also, do you plan other characters? Maybe the rest of the JoJos?   EDIT: nevermind the resolution request, the browser on my laptop downscales large graphics files. I downloaded it and it's huuuge. Should do great!"
StardustCrusaders,3dlm87,thekillerstove,7,Fri Jul 17 07:05:30 2015 UTC,"Just read it, the translation isn't THAT bad. Also, parts 7 and 8 are in a completely different continuity, they have nothing to do with the events of part 6."
StardustCrusaders,3dlm87,lakelurk,3,Fri Jul 17 07:13:11 2015 UTC,"If you want to skip, ok, but don't skip Part 6. You won't get spoiled on Part 5 like you would if, for example, you skipped part 3 and saw that in Part 4 Jotaro could stop time. Nothing from Part 5 comes over into 6."
StardustCrusaders,3dlm87,Mr_Flippers,3,Fri Jul 17 10:22:49 2015 UTC,"I recently read it and I really enjoyed it, it's one of my favorite Parts even if the translation's not great. There's some really cool Stand designs, and the battles are really intense. Plus, Gio's a cutie~  Honestly, I'd say read it. You can always re-read through the entire series, and by the time you get back around to Part Five, there will (hopefully) be a more complete translation."
StardustCrusaders,3dlm87,redheaded_robot,3,Fri Jul 17 12:37:34 2015 UTC,"I was fine with reading part 5, I could read, understand, and enjoy it. Some of the scans weren't great and looked like they needed to be cleaned up, but they were decent and they worked."
StardustCrusaders,3dlm87,AlienWarhead,3,Fri Jul 17 14:59:46 2015 UTC,"No seriously, read it. Translation is bad, but it's not so bad it completely ruins the experience. If you're going to be THAT purist you might as well wait until the full colour versions are all released before reading anything, but you'll be waiting so long that eventually you'll stop thinking."
StardustCrusaders,3dlm87,VicePresidentFruitly,3,Fri Jul 17 19:17:41 2015 UTC,"this is a pretty widely debated issue on stardustcrusaders, haha. i say skip it. i was someone who skipped 5 and 6 to go ahead and read 7, and it worked out pretty well. i'd recommend skipping 5 but reading 6, then going on to 7 and 8 and only reading 5 when the new translations come out."

StardustCrusaders,3dl3ln,Mr_Flippers,6,Tue Jul 21 04:11:04 2015 UTC,I feel like there's a bit of a difference between skipping Parts and reading them out of order. Part 5 I can understand and some people want to get thrown in without 20 years of history (e.g. Starting with SBR) but reading parts out of chronological order is just weird
StardustCrusaders,3dl3ln,Phob05,4,Fri Jul 17 04:35:41 2015 UTC,"I almost skipped part 5 but was convinced otherwise. I kind of get why some people didn't really get into it, but as of now it's probably my 2nd favorite part competing with DiU (though this might change when I finish SBR)"
StardustCrusaders,3dl3ln,ParadiseLost34,5,Fri Jul 17 09:48:47 2015 UTC,There is no real reason to not read it in order. Sure the part 5 scans aren't great but they make sense.

StardustCrusaders,3dl3ln,EarWorm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:38:58 2015 UTC,"Since I watched the anime for parts 1 and 2, only started reading the manga from part 3 onwards and initially skipped part 5 because I was hoping it'd get better scans (I eventually caved and read the shitty ones), my reading/watching order ended up being something like:  (Anime 1 > 2 >) 3 > Anime 3 > 4 > 6 > 7 > (Manga 2 > 1) > 5 > 8  Honestly I feel like the only parts you could read out of order would probably be 5, 2 and maybe 4. But reading Part 3 without knowing Part 1's story makes it lose a lot of its impact, reading Part 4 without knowing who Jotaro and Joseph are would be weird (ditto for part 6), and reading the SBR-verse Parts without knowledge of the previous ones is kind of unthinkable to me."
StardustCrusaders,3dl3ln,cherrydoughnut,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:01:01 2015 UTC,"Um I also read jjba out of order.

The Boom Boom Family could all do different things with their Stand. For example Benjamin Boom Boom could use metal to take the appearance of other people. Magnetism was just another effect. Boku no Rhythm wo Kiitekure I believe had pins on the things that were meant to explode, so they didn't explode til the pins popped. In A Silent Way used 3D kana whereas Echoes would place the kana on the ground or other things as a sort of trap. This is why the kana could be turned into dinosaurs by Scary Monsters.   The only Stand I can think of that's almost exactly like it's original universe counterpart is Part 8 Spoiler"

StardustCrusaders,3dfx90,Ramiels,4,Thu Jul 16 00:47:32 2015 UTC,Slapping existing translations onto them*  Typesetting and cleaning is their real work.
StardustCrusaders,3dfx90,SmurfRockRune,4,Wed Jul 15 23:42:55 2015 UTC,They are doing Part 4 and are currently in Yoshikage Kira Just Wants a Quiet Life.
StardustCrusaders,3dfx90,SmurfRockRune,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:31:04 2015 UTC,They also have some chapters done for every other part. Here you can get an idea of where they are at.
StardustCrusaders,3dfx90,Tobinounet,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:19:32 2015 UTC,Really? But the coloration in french is done since a long time already.
StardustCrusaders,3dfx90,razorbeamz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:44:30 2015 UTC,France gets special treatment when it comes to manga.
StardustCrusaders,3dfx90,Tobinounet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:52:52 2015 UTC,It's not official though. I just thought they had translated it from the english version but apparently no.
StardustCrusaders,3dfx90,razorbeamz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:58:00 2015 UTC,France cares more about manga than any country except Japan. Doesn't surprise me.
StardustCrusaders,3dfx90,Tobinounet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:58:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's the country that buys the most mangas and all right after Japan so..."
StardustCrusaders,3dfx90,Mr_Flippers,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:25:14 2015 UTC,I thought they were currently doing Part 5
StardustCrusaders,3dfx90,SmurfRockRune,2,Fri Jul 17 18:04:50 2015 UTC,Both. They're doing all 7 finished parts. I think they just have different people working on each one.  I believe 6 is the only finished one. Here you can see their recently updated list.
StardustCrusaders,3dfx90,Mr_Flippers,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:29:49 2015 UTC,That seems like the likely case. Also they've gotten a lot further with Part 5 than when I had to switch over to the awful but completed scans. I feel like checking them out (though I'm still reading Part 1 manga)
StardustCrusaders,3dfx90,SmurfRockRune,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:35:25 2015 UTC,"The older scans don't seem that awful to me right now. There are some noticeable grammar issues, but it's pretty easy to tell what's going on."
StardustCrusaders,3dfx90,Mr_Flippers,4,Thu Jul 16 08:22:00 2015 UTC,That's their problem. Duwang was written so poorly that there was humour to it and you could tell not to take it totally seriously. Part 5's scans are written well enough that you can tell what's going on but you can't realise when the translators make shit up (except when they say Venice is Vienna) or they write the characters incorrectly (e.g. Abbachio is a funny character).
StardustCrusaders,3de7mr,ParagonofMasculinity,23,Wed Jul 15 16:06:02 2015 UTC,How fresh are we talking?
StardustCrusaders,3de7mr,shubwub,0,Wed Jul 15 18:20:02 2015 UTC,whoever this is beat me to it.
StardustCrusaders,3de7mr,Maruhai,5,Wed Jul 15 18:34:01 2015 UTC,And their version is better
StardustCrusaders,3de7mr,cheeseuh,29,Thu Jul 16 14:49:48 2015 UTC,This tastes the same as yesterday's potato salad
StardustCrusaders,3de7mr,MollyTheMoopy,8,Wed Jul 15 16:10:00 2015 UTC,damn I like this comment better than my video.
StardustCrusaders,3de7mr,BlastRose,12,Wed Jul 15 16:42:08 2015 UTC,I didn't see that one coming
StardustCrusaders,3de7mr,CorinahDeficiency,6,Wed Jul 15 16:20:50 2015 UTC,"I saw it coming, but it was still very enjoyable.  Very good potato salad."
StardustCrusaders,3de7mr,CorinahDeficiency,3,Wed Jul 15 16:45:14 2015 UTC,Jesus Christ.
StardustCrusaders,3dedxk,DejWoSWK,10,Wed Jul 15 16:51:30 2015 UTC,"I've read the raws for Part One a handful of times, and it includes all three forms - there's some furigana (hiragana on the side/or above a kanji), but it's not on every kanji; words like '永遠' and '生命' have furigana, but words like '手' do not. I've got a moderate grasp of Japanese, so that coupled with how well I know the dialogue from Part One makes it fairly easy to understand and read; however, I still use my dictionary and programs like KanjiTomo to help me get through certain words or phrasing."
StardustCrusaders,3dedxk,redheaded_robot,3,Wed Jul 15 17:03:24 2015 UTC,Thank you for your info.
StardustCrusaders,3df97a,coma987,5,Wed Jul 15 20:26:55 2015 UTC,PS4 only. Just like the last demo.
StardustCrusaders,3df97a,ChichenJ,3,Wed Jul 15 20:50:11 2015 UTC,"I need to learn enough Japanese to navigate those menus. I'm not even sure how I managed to download the first demo, and not just a bunch of porn."
StardustCrusaders,3df97a,Phob05,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:03:11 2015 UTC,"Last demo was only PS4. I'm guessing this will be as well.   I mean, two days of good work is like, 3/4 of a PS4. Go to a tree farm or something."
StardustCrusaders,3df97a,Goodbye18000,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:50:45 2015 UTC,"Listed on both the jojo wiki and wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure:_Eyes_of_Heaven  It'll be for ps3 and ps4.  On the previews for the game there is also a ps3 logo in addition to the ps4 logo"
StardustCrusaders,3df97a,SolvoAmoveo,2,Thu Jul 16 10:39:37 2015 UTC,I know it will be for PS3 but will the demo be?
StardustCrusaders,3dcnw9,roronoapedro,50,Wed Jul 15 05:58:14 2015 UTC,"Something that I think is super cool, but I only noticed because of the anime: How this concept relates to The World.  When Jotaro finally challenges DIO to a fist fight, the fighting styles of both characters are fully reflected in their stands. The World, in particular, shows off some cool boxing moves, from basic guards to a fake-out followed by a quick jab. It reflects on DIO's boxing origins in Part 1! This is something the manga couldn't show off entirely."
StardustCrusaders,3dcnw9,MrOneHundredOne,15,Wed Jul 15 06:26:44 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched the anime yet because I'm waiting for the blu-ray, but I hope that's purposeful. It sounds really cool and it would fit extremely well with canon.  Also makes sense of the fact that Killer Queen isn't the strongest on a fistfight. Kira doesn't like fighting, so he probably never had a fistacuff with anyone. He doesn't know how to punch efficiently!"
StardustCrusaders,3dcnw9,LetterSequence,19,Wed Jul 15 06:38:50 2015 UTC,"Plus, punching becomes a bit redundant if you're going for the kill and everything you touch explodes."
StardustCrusaders,3dcnw9,BlazingSakura,17,Wed Jul 15 11:58:40 2015 UTC,"I like to imagine that stands are born to fit the person with the user. Take Gyro for instance. His stand completely caters to his skill with Spin. If anyone else got a stand like that, they would kind of be in some trouble, wouldn't they?"
StardustCrusaders,3dcnw9,Fenrirr,8,Wed Jul 15 07:54:12 2015 UTC,"Part 7 had a different dynamic with Stands, though. They were directly linked with the circumstances on which you acquired them. You sleep in Devil's Hand next to a fossil, you get dinosaur powers. You practice Spin long enough, you get Spin-related powers.  Stands are manifestations of the user's might and soul, but I was wondering specifically about things that the users probably do not know how to do and their Stands do."
StardustCrusaders,3dcnw9,cyberbloney,31,Wed Jul 15 17:29:58 2015 UTC,"Stands are psychic manifestations of oneself in some manner. Do not think of them as separate entities, but as /you/.  That means anything you are capable of, that can be reasonably replicated with your stands limbset, is possible. Hence why Jotaro could sketch out something he saw.   You have to remember that Stands are invisible to non-stand users, why? Because Stands are psychic constructs. When two stands punch each other, it is in reality a contest of wills between the two - but instead of the typical ""stare at eachother and grunt"" it is abstracted as a fist fight between two personal angelic-type beings.   Your stand can grant you new prowess in fields (such as Jotaro being able to extract the flesh bud despite not being a surgeon), and you already grant your stand prowess in your own fields."
StardustCrusaders,3dcnw9,SP_Rock,9,Wed Jul 15 10:58:02 2015 UTC,"This isn't exactly what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about Stands that develop practical abilities that their users probably never knew. Does the fact that the Stand is a master at X mean that the user, although having never practiced it, is now a master at it too?   I'm basically asking if Silver Chariot's expertise with a sword came before or after Polnareff's. The fact that Chariot is a personification of his will and that his will takes the form of a swordsman is not necessarely dependant to this swordsman already knowing how to wield a sword.  Plus Jotaro kinda just pulled that flesh bud out. The reason why surgeons couldn't do that was because it attacked whoever tried. That's not as much as skill as much as not flinching.  ninja edit because words are hard"
StardustCrusaders,3dcnw9,MorganTerror,9,Wed Jul 15 17:32:27 2015 UTC,"I thought a stand was the manifestation of your fighting spirit, so naturally if you were a fencer, your stand would fence too. for SBR johnny's stand got better as his spin abilities grew. kinda like how there is mini polnareff as a child and mini hierophant green as a child. weaker in skill but manifestation of the spirit."
StardustCrusaders,3dcnw9,MorganTerror,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:13:05 2015 UTC,"As I was saying to Sakura up there, Part 7 had a different dynamic with Stands. They were linked to the situation, and how you acquired them changed how they worked. It's not like in Parts 1~6 where it was linked to you specifically as much as it was linked to what you were doing when it first manifested, like Oh! Lonesome Me and Scary Monsters."
StardustCrusaders,3dcnw9,MorganTerror,3,Wed Jul 15 17:33:51 2015 UTC,"I imagine it varies depending on how autonomous the Stand is. In Polnareff's case, I think that Silver Chariot is naturally quick and precise, but it's skilled at fencing because Polnareff trained himself to use it for fencing. It looks like he had it most of his life (I think I remember Alessi saying if he didn't have his Stand as a child, he would've lost it), but he probably wasn't able to use it as skillfully until he trained with it after his sister's death."
StardustCrusaders,3dcnw9,MorganTerror,2,Wed Jul 15 21:28:47 2015 UTC,Drawing the fly in the photograph with enough clarity that Avdol would be able to look it up in an encyclopedia would take years of practice sketching. Is Jotaro that good of an artist by himself?
StardustCrusaders,3daccy,BagoBeefcake,25,Tue Jul 14 19:01:48 2015 UTC,Glorious.  Just glorious.

StardustCrusaders,3dby0a,BryanCV,18,Wed Jul 15 02:48:05 2015 UTC,"seconded, araki is the kind of artist to go against his own ""canon"" per say in order to make a picture the way he wants (and in this case, its to show off the birthmark).  i'd say to just get it done in the general upper shoulder/back of the neck area, i dont think you really need to worry about getting it completely accurate."
StardustCrusaders,3dby0a,arittz,7,Wed Jul 15 02:57:45 2015 UTC,"I love you guys, I'm a little less mad thanks to both of you.  I didn't think that way but you're right. Sometimes it's not even there even though it should be."
StardustCrusaders,3dby0a,BryanCV,4,Wed Jul 15 03:11:59 2015 UTC,;) no prob
StardustCrusaders,3dby0a,Mr_Flippers,8,Wed Jul 15 03:59:31 2015 UTC,"Araki has drawn it much more forward now, but traditionally it's further back. I was talking with a guy who got one and we all had various examples of where the star can be, all drawn by Araki.  Also, consider that there are no canon colours either. Is Kakyoins hair red? Is it silver? Is it pink? Is it blue? I don't know, but it all works well."
StardustCrusaders,3dby0a,MrOneHundredOne,4,Wed Jul 15 05:41:11 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, Gappy in Part 8 has it on his shoulder blade (generally the same place s your first two pics). Araki does what he wants for his art book stuff, but you've got the location right!"

StardustCrusaders,3darjs,SinCama,11,Tue Jul 14 20:44:49 2015 UTC,"Something I found interesting was that individual enemies can still have dialouge with each other, like Jotaro (probably) asking N'Doul why he serves DIO.  And while my understanding of Japanese is basic, I did notice that Dio had much more to say in this vid than he usually does. It turns out that Dio and Kars now have special dialouge when they face each other. Rough google translate below. Kars: ""自ら食料になりにくるとはな…吸血鬼(Do not and themselves come to become a food ... vampire)""  Dio: ""このディオをエサにしようというのかッ！やってみる！(Is it that you try this audio to bait ~Tsu! Try!)""  So I assume its something along the lines of ""You will become my food...vampire."" ""You wish to feed on I, Dio? Try it!""  Personally, I love that there's now interaction between the two big villains of Pre-Stand JoJo, which was noticably absent from ASB."
StardustCrusaders,3darjs,LuizPSC,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:56:22 2015 UTC,"Nice! i hope to see more interaction between characters not only fighting against one another, but i wonder if there is any about parthers interacting somehow."

StardustCrusaders,3darjs,marniconuke,2,Tue Jul 14 23:11:15 2015 UTC,the fact that you always know where your enemy is totally ruins the idea of being n0doul. this is game breaking for me :(
StardustCrusaders,3darjs,Khliyh,2,Tue Jul 14 23:14:17 2015 UTC,"Actually, now that you mention it, I think it'd be cool if they came up with a tagging system where if you tagged an enemy, you know where they are even when they're standing still. And if you didn't tag them and they're standing still you won't know where they are."
StardustCrusaders,3darjs,JustSmashh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:31:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah but from a gameplay / game design perspective N'Doul would become super OP because he could just hide in places throughout the map, and sort of being given a lot of consequence-free hits.   Although it sounds interesting, it might make things very frustrating / bullshit (at times), it could work if they went for a system like /u/Khliyh suggests, but at this point, it may or may not be too late in the development to create a system like that. (but what do I know)"
StardustCrusaders,3darjs,Khliyh,2,Wed Jul 15 13:15:34 2015 UTC,"Actually, after posting that comment I thought about it a bit more and I don't think it'll work, to be honest. It's only a 2v2 and as shown in the manga/anime N'Doul can track a lot more than 2 people. So either way, it'll be so that you can see both opponents at the same time anyway.   And as for N'Doul being able to just hide in a corner, that may be the case in a few maps, but from the gameplay I've seen, I don't think it's easy to find a spot.  Although, knowing the community, once it's found people are just gonna cheese that spot so idk"
StardustCrusaders,3darjs,marniconuke,2,Wed Jul 15 13:49:29 2015 UTC,"but for what i've seen maps aren't really that big, so playing hide and seek shouldn't be something THAT frustrating. the ideal situation would be for you to hide, strike with your stand and then move position, like a sniper. but since you are slow you always risk the chance of being spotted. i just don't think is THAT OP. the players on the video were pretty static but if a pro hits you with a couple of well done combos then you are done for. If you get teamed with n'doul then you should always be obligated to protect him? i just don't think those are really good mechanics, but i guess we are gonna get mor einfo when the demo launches."
StardustCrusaders,3darjs,ChichenJ,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:49:00 2015 UTC,"This looks really fun, I can't wait to create some absurd combos. Really hope the localization gets announced soon. I can't wait to see the full roster.  I might make a Japanese PSN so I can play the demo..."

The Black Lagoon episodes about the neo Nazis, the ones about the creepy transexual sex slave kids, and some of the Japan arc ones would work perfectly. Probably one of the Roberta ones too."

I'll go through and credit the artists as best I can, since it appears they're not credited properly by dorkly.  Edit: Looks like the rest of them are more or less credited properly (most of the pixiv links are to the artists' main gallery, rather than the direct piece); the Eobard Thawne image is hard to track down, but it appears to have come from someone on 4chan, according to Danbooru."

StardustCrusaders,3d7ure,king_awesome,2,Tue Jul 14 05:31:59 2015 UTC,Were you the person here who recommended Kaiji right when the Gambler D'arby episodes first aired? I watched and then read all of Kaiji and Akagi right after that. They are both fantastic series.  My only criticism is that the author has to be the undisputed king of dragging things out. There's a mahjong game that takes place entirely in one night that goes on for at least 20 volumes. Even the 26 episodes of the anime is mostly spent covering this match and it ends maybe a third of the way in.  I actually don't even know if that match ever ended. I know the series is still running so it's possible he's been writing this match for two decades. I kind of admire the author's sheer audacity.
StardustCrusaders,3d7ure,Von_Stroheim,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:55:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. I only started watching the anime after D'arby the gambler aired.   I know exactly what you mean. The scans are still going on with that fight. Or the scans are, at least. There is nothing more frustrating than reading a couple of chapters, getting really into it, then there are no more chapters   Also, apparently Fukumoto doesn't want Washizu to be the last fight. So expect an even more dragged out fight in the future!"

It did something that made the series jump in popularity and become extremely well-known, and that makes people think it's the best part.  Part 3 is very good, but parts 4-8 are all better I think. But most people haven't experienced them, either because they think that part 3 is the epitome and don't bother, or because it's just hard to access them (no anime for 4-8, and in English no official manga either), or they simply don't like JoJo all that much and only have the most well-known part to go on."

I know that part 7 is very emotionally intense (I hear that it's got a very mature story line and heartbreaking deaths Spoiler ) and I've seen it be compared to Evangelion, but Part 7 just seems like the Bee's Knees. Someone give me a little nudge or maybe show me a few more different aspects between the two?"
StardustCrusaders,3d4mjg,Guterman50,3,Mon Jul 13 23:59:09 2015 UTC,"Part 7 is a completely new universe. Jotaro won't appear in it. Personally since 7 is my favorite I would recommend that.  It has lots of fanservice cameos of previous characters. You'll see ones that looked similar to Avdol, Stroheimer etcetc but that's not the main point. Moving to a monthly format it allows for better story structure within each chapters. It took the journey aspect of 3&5 and put in another goal in between the stands battles. Nearly all the stands are ability heavy and acts as aids for the people instead being the ones doing the ORA. They are more ones that carry emotional themes that aims to reopen the old scars. The dynamics between the main two protagonists is superb as you can't really separate them. It's a reimagining of Part1 with a lot more emotional weight. The personal journey for Johnny is just fantastic as he matures throughout the ride across America.  On top of that, Part 7 also has a highly satisfying ending. It's also further away than part6 so it has less chance of being animated. I'm sorry if I'm not giving Part6 chance here, because it does have the most memorable moment towards the end, but personally I just love Part 7 so much more."

Araki's style changes quite a bit around part 4 and 5, and part 6 onward are much more developed to his current drawing and writing style. Part 3 was just the basic introductions of stands, everything onward just gets cooler and more bizarre."

StardustCrusaders,3d4mjg,PinkGoldJigglypuff,5,Tue Jul 14 00:03:25 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to convince my friends to read past part 3 because in my opinion parts 1-3 are relatively weak to the rest of the series. But besides that opinion I have many different arguments to argue for why you should continue.   First every Jojo part has a different feel to it. Part 3 was very much this epic adventure to fight Dio. There was a goal from start to finish and the people in between we're just users trying to stop them. Now from that you go to part 4 which is very much a slice of life Jojo. The stand users they encounter are not exactly bad. In many cases some of the stand users start from a villain to an ally. Moving from part 3 to 4 is a bit hard cause it starts slow as it builds the town and people but then it moves to become a community of stand users working to defeat an enemy.   Now going to part 5 it moves away from the solo battles you've seen to more group team battles. Multiple users working together in a fight. This is very much a mafia story and every fight is a fight to the death. Unlike part 3 where some of the users survive and get hospitalized after their fight, every fight will end with someone dead. The translations are a little poor but you still can read it and it's amazing. Part 6 is a prison story and holy shit is it one of my favorite. It's very much a story of dealing with the past and you get some of my favorite characters of the series in this one. I don't want to say much because I feel I can accidentally spoil it. Part 7 is a combination of part 2 and 3 where it's this grand epic adventure but instead of a group you focus on the relationship between the two mains. It has one of the most amazing character development of the series and is debatably the best part of the entire series and I can easily see why. Finally part 8 is still on going and all I can really say is holy shit is this weird. It's probably the most bizzare part so far from the Jojo to the characters and fights is just so weird but really good.   Moving from story and plot the stand fights are so much better in the future parts. In part 3 it is very much to people fighting like a normal shounen fight at times. But in the future parts the stand users have a lot more creative and sometimes weaker powers. For example to be vague you have a user whose stand power is to put sounds on people and if you don't think he can defeat people with that then your wrong. These powers create a lot more creative and methodical fight then two people fighting it out. There is a lot of thought and strategy that goes into fights. I really love all the fights after part 3 cause even if someone has a shitty power they use it in such a good way that they become super powerful.   My final point is that you learn so much about the events of part 3 in parts 4, 5, and 6. You learn about the origins of stands, motivations of villains, and many of the events of 4-6 spiral out because of the events of part 3. There are many consequences that come from the events and you see what they are in the future parts. As well the future parts aren't as straight forward as 1-3. In 1-3 you know who the villain is right away and they are fighting to get to that villain. In 4-8 the villain isn't revealed to the characters and they are constantly working to figure it out. Hell we are 44 chapters into part 8 and it's still super unclear who the main antagonist is.   Sorry for the longish post hopefully this helps you read the future parts. They are amazing and you will have a great time. Have fun!"

StardustCrusaders,3d4mjg,Shrimpolacola,3,Mon Jul 13 15:59:04 2015 UTC,I loved part 3 but it's my least favourite part to be honest.
StardustCrusaders,3d4mjg,ultibman5000,2,Mon Jul 13 19:40:48 2015 UTC,"As someone who has read through Parts 1-7 and is currently reading Jojolion, I feel the series has a lot of draws that keeps it consistently fresh. But to answer your question, I feel the series has its highest peaks Part 4 and beyond.  Also, for there to be a stronger correlation, these are my ranks: Steel Ball Run > Battle Tendency > Diamond is Unbreakable > Stardust Crusaders > Stone Ocean > Phantom Blood > Vento Aureo  Diamond is Unbreakable to me is a part that I consider to fix a lot of flaws that I had with Stardust, being the main villain being seldom incorporated into the story sans the finale and issues with a lot of filler. I feel that Part 4 villain spoiler. Don't think it's anything major but just to be safe is a really interesting main villain because he has a lot of backstory given to him on why he is the person he is and by the end, you understand all of his character motivations and why the people of Morioh should care about him. It also does the really good job of making most of the fights interesting and relevant to the plot and characters.   One issue I've had with Stardust was that there were a lot of filler fights that ultimately led to nowhere outside of the group getting closer to Egypt while some were outright solved with Jotaro just overpowering the foe. Part 4 fixes the issue by making a lot of fights based on Josuke outsmarting the enemies with unorthodox tactics (reminiscent of Joseph) and makes the fights stronger based on thought than might. This compliments Josuke's stand really well, where it's clearly defined as being able to heal or fix anything outside of healing himself or bringing the dead back to life. A lot of the best moments were Josuke coming up with tactics that were completely out of nowhere but made sense in the context or scenes like Part 4 It's very exhilarating.  I think Part 4 stands really high in the series because of Josuke's persona being really strong. He has the Joestar spirit but he's a scheming teenager who's kind of a jerk (just like Joseph). So a lot of his personality bleeds into the manga and makes Part 4 really stand out. It also helps that Part 4 is a slice of life, which is already an absurd concept for JoJo's that works surprisingly well.  Vento Aureo (I'll keep this one short) has the displeasure of having a lot of good ideas that just don't feel well fleshed. It may be that I read the poor translation, but Giorno himself is a very boring character and his stand works too broadly, practically being a McGuffin to all of the fights' solutions. The Part also has the worst villain in the series for having a very boring presence and just never being there. However, there are a lot of well fleshed out fights and Bruno is one of the best characters to come out of the series, making me wish that he was the main character and Giorno being reduced to a side character. This of course varies from fans, but the flaws of Part 5 mixed with some plot points that contradict earlier Parts and ruining some of my personal favorite characters sort of makes me feel lukewarm compared to other Parts. It's still pretty good and there are some good draws (mainly Bruno and his gang), but the flaws push down the parts that I really liked.  Part 6 is really good. I really liked Jolyne, who I felt was a much more believable and fleshed out delinquent than Jotaro (and her just being a better character). Just because she is kind of a punk doesn't necessary mean that she's awful, as later chapters show her more sympathetic side and why she was thrown in prison to begin with. I really liked the side characters and main villain in this part as well. FF and Hermes worked as great sidekicks while the setting felt really bizarre (pardon the lack of a better word), probably the most unique that I could think the series delved into. Being a prison, Jolyne is practically surrounded by stand users and the tight confinement and rules makes it very hard for her to defeat her enemies while remaining under the radar. Speaking of enemies, Father Pucci is a great villain and his intentions are very interesting (not going to say what). Speaking of plans:  Part 6 ending spoilers  So yeah. Granted I rank it lower, I think it's still a really well written Part. I just enjoyed reading Parts 3 and 4 slightly more, but that isn't to say 6 is bad at all. In fact, it's great.  Part 7 is my personal favorite and feels like a culmination of everything that the series led into. Araki's improvement in the back stories was apparent and gave almost every relevant character a strong motivation to pursue their goals. Johnny Joestar and Gyro Zeppeli are also the best written Joestars and Zeppelis in my opinion, and their relationship shows how they went from having a same goal to becoming outright close friends. It isn't just a chapter or two of them realizing how much each means to the other, you get an entire manga with many moments that range from them making fun of each other to clashing over what they feel the right thing to do is or figuring out how to defeat an enemy together. Even characters like Dio Brando aren't just ""evil"". They have reasons for wanting to pursue the race and aren't simply settling for a one dimensional goal. In fact, none of the protagonists have a reason that's broad like for ""the good of humanity"". It's all constrained in prior events in their lives that shaped them into their current character. It feels really natural and nothing they do is out of the Part's logic.  The fights also rely very little on Stands throughout most of the Part and in fact, some of the best fights barely have stands. The True Man's World is probably in my top 3 fights in the entire series for that reason alone, along with excellent characters backing them up. Aside from characters, the art is absolutely gorgeous (thank Araki for moving the series to monthly) and the setting is fantastic and leads to some great fights. Not to mention Funny Valentine, whom i will refrain talking about because it's just best for the reader to find out his quirks on their own. Honestly, Part 7 just feels like the perfect JoJo's part. It has great action, well fleshed characters, the spirit and creativeness the series is known for, all wrapped in a giant journey across the United States. It's just fantastic.  So the very short way of saying it is, yes, Parts 4-7 maintain what I feel Part 3 did best and even more. I feel that JoJo's as a series manages to be different with every Part but keeps what fans love in its core. They all have the action, comedy, and spirit as to what makes the series so great and it remains consistent throughout. I would honestly recommend reading the manga to at least get to experience Stone Ocean and Steel Ball Run (it will be a very long time before either gets adapted). I feel Diamond is Unbreakable will eventually get an adaptation (I really hope it does), but if you're antsy for more JoJo's, the Invincible Trio just finished retranslating Part 4 (and did a fine job at that) so you don't have to deal with awful (but slightly charming) Duwang. So yeah, you have plenty of reading material if you can't wait for an anime confirmation.  Sorry for the super long post. It's hard summing up 4 Parts of JoJo's in a single post.  On a side note, I'm not very comfortable comparing Part 2 to the rest of the series (as it's really high on my list). I feel post-Battle Tendency, the series shifts dramatically in its format with Stands, so it feels a bit out of place putting Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency on my list to compare with other Parts. I think part of my draw for Part 2 is just how over the top the Part is along with Joseph Joestar being one of my favorite anime/manga characters in general. It has its draws as to why I place the Part so high, but yeah, just a side note."

All parts are definitely worth the read and hopefully worth watching as well some day."
StardustCrusaders,3d4mjg,Goldprint,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:19:24 2015 UTC,"I think the series gets a lot better after part 3 but its up to personal preference. Part 3 is an iconic classic and even though its only just finished being animated the anime managed to capture that classic feel. Its a really simple story, with relatively simple characters but its done incredibly well. Part 3 is the most accessible to anyone who just wants a great shounen. Later parts have a lot more nuance to them. They have deeper plots, more slow moments of non violent character interaction, and more character development. I'm not sure I can say they feel more ""epic"" but personally I enjoyed them a lot more. As you know by now each part has a very different feel to it so maybe there will be some you rate higher than part 3 and some you rate lower but overall I think Araki's creativity and writing style improves a ton."
StardustCrusaders,3d4mjg,PictoShark,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:55:40 2015 UTC,"The expectations along with the focus change drastically for each part going forward. Sadly in terms of sheer world scale epics, Part 3 is the only true globe trotting adventure. Each part just builds up to its own epic-ness in it's own special way.  Part 4, is more chill with a focus on daily life. Think Persona 4 if you ever heard of it.   Part 5, really tries to bring back the team dynamic of Part 3 with a lot of focus on the side characters  Part 6, while a bit contained in scope branches out and applies all the lessons learned from the first 5 parts culminating in a finale that is unexpected  Part 7, is Araki's best work  Part 8, has an insane amount of focus on mysteries and lore"
StardustCrusaders,3d4mjg,lilianalight,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:58:21 2015 UTC,"The majority of JoJo fans who've read Parts 1-7/8 seem to be of the notion that 4-8 is better overall than 1-3. Parts 1 and 3 tend to skew near the bottom of most people's lists, but Part 2 tends to skew near the top. However, most people seem to prefer Parts 4 and 7 in particular as their favorites. With Part 5 skewing near the bottom alongside 1 and 3; and Part 6 being the wild card that you either love, hate, or find to be completely average. It seems Part 8 is fairly popular with fans so far, but it's not over yet. I've personally read Parts 1-7, and I think you're in for a real treat compared to what you've seen so far."

While Part 1 to 3 may have brought Jojo to popularity, Parts Four and Seven are what defines Jojo. It's not that the earlier parts are worst, but Part Four and beyond helps set Jojo a part from other mangas (or animes, with the most recent series.)."

Part 4 isn't as action oriented or journey oriented as part 3 it's kinda slice of lifeish i guess in a weird way... except with some of the best characters and most hilarious writing of the series and probably the best villain of the series. and is overall my favorite part  Part 5 Has my personal favorite side characters but one of the more boring (i guess) main character (although i've heard part of that can be blamed on the translation), it has amazing battles it feels alot like part 3 for me in terms of the journey and battles although not too many battles where they have to outsmart the enemy more so full on fights.  Part 6 Has one of the coolest and most badass (more badass than Jotaro in my opinion) but has weak side characters other than one or two i guess i went into part 6 expecting the most but got the least i feel. The main villain is really badass but the ending is somewhat good and bad the thing about part 6 is the stands kinda get ridiculously OP and i feel that was a huge issue i had with it.  Part 7 is AMAZING the main character feels original throughout the part the main characters stand get more and more awesome and probably the 2 best characters of the series the battles are fun the journey part is there the Villain / smaller villains are probably the most memorable in the series as they have unique stands and most have an actual entire backstory or personality to them.  Part 8 can't say much yet as i'm only on the 10th chapter but good so far."

StardustCrusaders,3czidv,ArabiaFats,35,Sun Jul 12 05:33:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, he used his ass to create ripples."
StardustCrusaders,3czidv,Seboy666,19,Sun Jul 12 05:34:28 2015 UTC,"It's kinda poetic, really."
StardustCrusaders,3czidv,DiabolicGnome,32,Sun Jul 12 05:46:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know why, but now I'm imagining the ""SONO CHI NO SA-DA-ME! JOJOOOO!"" scene only he's mooning Dio and unleashing rippes out of his ass."

StardustCrusaders,3czidv,kingofthrowaway,20,Sun Jul 12 07:55:00 2015 UTC,The lesser known ability of Wamuu's Wind Mode.
StardustCrusaders,3czidv,lilianalight,10,Sun Jul 12 15:29:41 2015 UTC,it's the Passing Wind mode.
StardustCrusaders,3czidv,Mr_Flippers,10,Sun Jul 12 16:25:23 2015 UTC,If he eats enough Mexican food he can do the Holy Shitstorm
StardustCrusaders,3czidv,EtrianDemifiend,6,Sun Jul 12 18:15:16 2015 UTC,It's the rip-ple!
StardustCrusaders,3czidv,Dragoryu3000,23,Sun Jul 12 15:30:29 2015 UTC,That's not exactly what I was expecting
StardustCrusaders,3czidv,megatauntaun,22,Sun Jul 12 07:08:55 2015 UTC,I was expecting to read the typical things about breathing powers that are quite easy to learn and get used to.  I didn't expect farting by willpower.
StardustCrusaders,3czidv,Lenoh,9,Sun Jul 12 08:03:20 2015 UTC,I don't know whether I should be pleased or disappointed.
StardustCrusaders,3czidv,Callinicus,8,Sun Jul 12 12:14:34 2015 UTC,Yes.
StardustCrusaders,3czidv,awesomeman23,6,Sun Jul 12 15:30:50 2015 UTC,...You did not mention the rectum.  Currently imagining the opening themes played by fart.
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,MegaLlamas5,16,Sun Jul 12 23:21:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, read part 4 and the others. Part 4 is my favorite part. The protagonists and villains are all so interesting. Part 4 has my favorite villain in the entire series. The stands are all really unique and fun. It only gets better after part 3. Read at batoto.  Only real thing I can note is that Part 5's translation is not amazing. It's being updated right now and will hopefully be better when it's done. I consider it currently one of my least favorite parts but I'm guessing a lot of that is due to the translation. I think the stands are fucking cool in part 5 though, a lot of them are really powerful and creative."
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,ChichenJ,3,Sun Jul 12 23:25:31 2015 UTC,Are the translations by 'Jojo's colored adventure' bad as well?
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,shauryab98,9,Mon Jul 13 06:03:37 2015 UTC,"Nope, those are the guys doing the accurate translation, but it may take a while since they are working on all parts simultaneously."
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,thekillerstove,3,Mon Jul 13 06:05:33 2015 UTC,No. The colored adventure ones are great.
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,ChichenJ,28,Mon Jul 13 06:06:11 2015 UTC,"As good as Stardust Crusaders is, it's probably the worst out of the parts that have stands in them. The rest are extremely good. The sidebar will tell you everything you need to know about reading JoJo."
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,SlimeStack,10,Sun Jul 12 23:25:24 2015 UTC,SDC is my least favorite part of JoJo. Please read the manga.
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,mrminun,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:15:14 2015 UTC,"any particular reason why and are those reasons fixed? I had problems about how it stared to drag and how all the battle began to last two episodes but i still enjoyed it, also jotaro was too strong but from what ive read so far he seems to be only a supporting character and josuke is the lead."
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,mrminun,6,Mon Jul 13 00:36:51 2015 UTC,"Josuke is the lead, and Star Plat takes a serious nerfing. Jotaro just isn't nearly as compelling as any of the other JoJos. (Except Giorno, but even he's still interesting.)   The battles aren't nearly as lame as well, because for example, there's a lot more little stuff. Like events surrounding a certain Italian restaurant or a certain house fire will probably only be one episode, due to their simplicity.   Also, Josuke doesn't just Dora Ra Ra his way out of situations, like Jotaro tended to do.   Another thing working in part 4's favour is the fact that almost all the heroic characters are compelling in some way or another. It's really nice to see chapters where stuff happens without the protagonist present, where we still get progress/events occurring.   Also, the villains are way cooler, just as characters. The fact that we have Part 4 End or Part 5 End it's just way more interesting as a fight."
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,ArabiaFats,8,Mon Jul 13 01:26:21 2015 UTC,"I've read up to part 7, and they're all very good and worth reading, with 4 actually being the standout, IMO. Edges out Stardust Crusaders in my book for the methodical pace, suspense, tactics and overall atmosphere.  The stand fights in 4 and 5 are superb. 4's are good because there aren't a lot of powerups, and the powers are neither so straightforward as to be repetitive, nor so open-ended as to allow a lot of victories through finding new uses. This forces the characters in part 4 to really fight smart rather than simply tough or clever.  The fights in 5, on the other hand, require some iffy innovation to work, but they leave a big impression nonetheless for their intensity. The minor baddies often feel like real human beings, so at times you may actually find yourself sort of rooting for them (the first two enemy stand ""team-ups"" showcase the best of this)."
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,Dat_Bass1,3,Sun Jul 12 23:57:00 2015 UTC,Have you finished SBR yet?
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,ArabiaFats,3,Mon Jul 13 06:49:10 2015 UTC,"Yes indeed. I'd call it probably my third favorite overall, and its strength probably has to be its plot and character development. Every stage in the race became white-knuckle material, since A) I never really knew what was going to happen next, and B) I grew attached to the Johnny/Gyro combo."
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,vyhox,9,Mon Jul 13 12:57:35 2015 UTC,This accurately describes my response.
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,PochoChorizo,7,Mon Jul 13 00:55:53 2015 UTC,"Part 4 is pretty good. A little different from SC but it has a bigger cast with more entertaining characters, some really interesting Stands and with better Stand fights than SC. It's not too long, I'd say the length is barely bigger than SC's.  The afterward parts are all varying levels of good:   Part 5 has ridiculously good Stand fights, desings and powers (some of the best in the entire series in my opinion) but suffers from a subpar translation and a rather flat JoJo. It also has an underwhelming ending but it's not as bad some people make it to be.  Part 6 is odd, the story is better than previous parts but the fights tend to be kind of forgettable with some notable exceptions. It has a really interesting villain and the supporting cast is amazing but aside from that this part tends to be pretty hit or miss. Some people really love it while others really don't. Both this part and Part 5 have a similar length to Part 4. Part 7 is perfect. The story is superb, the characters are amazing and most of the fights are incredibly well thought out. The Stand desings differ a little from previous parts since now they take the form of objects rather than humans but they are still pretty good. It's the longest part by far but you won't even notice it while reading. It goes by incredibly fast. Part 8 is unfinished so it's hard to make any comments about it right now other than saying that it's good and worth reading   I think batoto has all the parts but I could be mistaken, either way it has the best scans and translations. I suggest you use it over other sites."
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,SiberskEsto,5,Mon Jul 13 03:19:09 2015 UTC,it only gets better from here
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,Rainbolt,4,Mon Jul 13 01:49:12 2015 UTC,Hell yes everything from part 4 on is amazing.
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,EtrianDemifiend,5,Mon Jul 13 02:41:03 2015 UTC,"Part 4 is usually agreed to be the community's favorite part, right next to part 7. So yes, go read it, Josuke and the rest of the crew are totally awesome, so are their stands and battles."
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,Von_Stroheim,5,Mon Jul 13 03:26:48 2015 UTC,"Every part after is better than Stardust, think of it that way. Part 3 was like a prototype to the awesomeness to come."
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,FatiguedWalri,6,Mon Jul 13 04:50:18 2015 UTC,7 and 8 might be the best parts of the entire series
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,Mr_Flippers,4,Sun Jul 12 23:50:13 2015 UTC,"4,6,7 and 8 are better than Stardust Crusaders, so yes it is damn worth it.  I read on Batoto, in the subs sidebar under the manga and anime banner it says ""where to read JoJo's Bizarre Adventure?"". Follow that up and you'll make it to Part 4. For Part 4 either the coloured scans or the Invincible Trio scans (black and white) are great so you're all good."
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,Von_Stroheim,7,Mon Jul 13 01:11:46 2015 UTC,"but you see, all of the battles in part 5 are better than stardust"
StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,Dat_Bass1,7,Mon Jul 13 04:52:00 2015 UTC,"And it has better villains.  Yes, I'm serious. La Squadra di Esecuzione + Diavolo > DIO. Fight me."

StardustCrusaders,3d2bcw,Akrinu,6,Thu Jul 16 09:25:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, After Stardust Crusaders stands become A LOT more interesting and unique! Also part 4 has the best Jojo."
StardustCrusaders,3czdzz,Bambime,18,Sun Jul 12 04:09:28 2015 UTC,What would John Cena's stand be?
StardustCrusaders,3czdzz,halalpigs,21,Sun Jul 12 04:22:32 2015 UTC,A stand for JoJo Cena. He already got the pose and the catchphrase down.
StardustCrusaders,3czdzz,Katamori777,5,Sun Jul 12 14:52:54 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's awesome!"
StardustCrusaders,3czdzz,Mister_Doc,2,Sun Jul 12 15:31:51 2015 UTC,I mean we already knew it was gonna be a Star Platinum type anyways.
StardustCrusaders,3czdzz,highTrolla,20,Sun Jul 12 17:37:06 2015 UTC,"Potato Salad*'s stand would probably be called ""You Can't See Me"" and it would enable him to turn invisible."

StardustCrusaders,3d0ewq,TSprite,23,Sun Jul 12 13:25:55 2015 UTC,didn't Joseph use spaghetti noodles and improvised weaponry before ? to me that seems more impressive
StardustCrusaders,3d0ewq,Zouledge,22,Sun Jul 12 13:42:11 2015 UTC,But punching spaghetti though.

StardustCrusaders,3d0ewq,SP_Rock,6,Mon Jul 13 13:14:15 2015 UTC,"So in other words, you enjoy creating situations where people want to murder each other? You sadistic bastard!  Jolyne is best jojo because of how much growth she displays over the course of Part 6. She starts out immature and bratty, blaming others for her problems. By the end, she's an independent badass that becomes a master of using her Stand in incredibly creative ways. Of course, Johnny has lots of growth too, which is why he's the second best Jojo, but I prefer the way it's shown in Jolyne."
StardustCrusaders,3d0ewq,Arquinas,8,Sun Jul 12 19:40:13 2015 UTC,"My favorite Jojo is definitely a tie between Jolyne and Joseph, but you know what? People here have already explained what makes Jolyne so great, and everyone, literally everyone, already knows Joseph is magnificent. So I'm going to talk about Jotaro.  You could say that Jotaro is the Jojo. The ""ORA ORA ORA"" and ""Yare yare daze"" may not be exclusive to Jotaro, but there's no doubt he's the one they ""belong"" to the most. Stardust Crusaders is probably the most famous of the Parts, with Jotaro being its most iconic character (except maybe for Dio, but then, Jotaro killed Dio, didn't he?).  But does he deserve to be? I didn't think so at first. For a lot of Stardust Crusaders, I wasn't sure I liked Jotaro. He seemed to much like a character who was just conceived to be ""cool"". But then I got to D'arby the Gambler, and suddenly, I got it. Jotaro, is tough, clever, and determined, but all the Jojos are. Star Platinum is powerful, but it isn't Jotaro's real super power. No, that's his stone cold demeanor. He keeps a cool head and puts up with Steely Dan's abuse, he's so hard to read even a mind reader couldn't figure out what he was up to, and he's got the nerves of steel to force his own heart to stop beating.  And that's why Jotaro is the best Jojo."

Araki could pull some sort of crazy twist or something.

StardustCrusaders,3d0ewq,FeenieVonKarma,6,Mon Jul 13 02:37:31 2015 UTC,Jolyne because I love her character arc. She starts as a girl who has a few delinquent tendencies because of her issues with her father and she gets thrown in the deep end way over her head but she actually manages to keep focus and improve herself and her relationship with her father through all of that. Also I think it is ridiculously refreshing to see a girl in Japanese media who is able to have a somewhat normal healthy view of sex. She's neither a shy prude nor a crazy slut just a teenage girl. Oh and her stand power is a perfect example of JJBA making a simple power amazingly useful in the hands of someone intelligent.
StardustCrusaders,3d0ewq,megathrasher,3,Sun Jul 12 19:17:55 2015 UTC,"Joseph is a really fucking strong contender. I'm particularly fond of how you see him at different stages of his life, and you're shown how he matured, but also how he stayed exactly the same in some regards. The Empress(? think it was Empress) fight was a perfect example of this. And when you look at Battle Tendency, it was a great shift in tone from a super heroic, serious protagonist, to a cocky trickster asshole.    I really like Josuke but I only just learned about him a couple weeks back. However I can say this, give it time and perhaps a re-read and he could well be my favourite. He's like Japanese young-Joseph, and he manages to outshine the supporting cast, which is difficult. (Not saying they're bad, on the contrary -but Josuke manages to remain the leader!)  That said, on a side-note, I like Jotaro as Josuke's partner, they work together well and Jotaro didn't overshadow him like he could have done."

Stealing someone's stand, stealing someone's identity Part 8, stealing an emotion/memory from someone, stealing the earth's population, etc. I think the funniest application would be stealing a building's ""structural integrity"" to cause it to collapse."

StardustCrusaders,3cz9o9,megathrasher,12,Sun Jul 12 04:12:05 2015 UTC,"They're my top 2 favorite series, but I recognize Araki and Togashi as two different artists. I see more of Toriyama's influence on Togashi than anything. Jojo's is so unique that not much can successfully pull off what it does and succeed... Hunter is a shonen, but more serious than Jojo's comedy-centered escapades typically. Even if the ""magic power"" ideas are silly, they are still presented in a serious tone most of the time (giant bugs being interesting)  But sure, how could Togashi not be inspired by Araki? Jojo's is one of the oldest and most influential mangas. And it drew heavily from FotNS."
StardustCrusaders,3cz9o9,Miti-Mumway,9,Sun Jul 12 03:37:59 2015 UTC,"I've heard that HunterXHunter's fights of outsmarting rather than overpowering was very similar to JoJo but I've not seen it so I can't say.

StardustCrusaders,3cz9o9,Mr_Flippers,11,Sun Jul 12 03:30:07 2015 UTC,"The first statement is very accurate. Also the guy who wrote Hunter also wrote YuYu Hakisho so theres some similarities to that.

StardustCrusaders,3cz9o9,BLAHxBLAH,3,Sun Jul 12 07:19:17 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen the anime, but based on some of the anime/manga differences I've read about, particularly in regards to the ending, it really does sound like the manga is a big improvement, wrapping up the main plot and certain character arcs in less typical ways. It's up there with certain parts of JoJo as one of the best shonen I've read, IMO."
StardustCrusaders,3cz9o9,ArabiaFats,3,Sun Jul 12 07:43:25 2015 UTC,"One other big regard by which HxH drew inspiration from JoJo is in structure - though it's a consistent duo of protagonists throughout, every arc has them fighting alongside different allies in a different location, often in a different genre altogether.  Yeah, the series starts out with a couple of rather simple shonen trope arcs, but by the end it's also had some extremely dark and surprising stories in crime and war drama genres, there's an arc that takes place inside an MMO, and one arc is even about political campaigns. They're all tied together by the same overarching story and the two main protagonists, but every arc is drastically different, much like JoJo's different parts."
StardustCrusaders,3cz9o9,enragedmanatee,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:46:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly, outsmarting is the word for both series, and I'm only half part 2 yet.

The anime doesn't cover the entire HnK manga, so if you haven't read the manga, I'd highly recommend it!  Plus, in the beat-em-up games HnK: Ken's Rage (1&2), Koyasu voices Rei, Sugita voices Shin, and Ishizuka  voices Kaioh, so you've got Dio, Joseph and Oldseph!"
StardustCrusaders,3cz9o9,Khliyh,3,Sun Jul 12 17:17:59 2015 UTC,"Jojo pretty much inspired anything shounen after 1989 so don't really think too bad about that.

Like complete opposite, one wants to kill of the main character cause of fear from their undying spirit and will while the other HxH Seriously if Hisoka had a spin-off series the perfect name would be Battle Tendency.

And I'm glad for that, because I love series where unique powers are pitted against one another in strategic ways :D  I fell out of love with Naruto too, but not because it ripped anything off. Because it stopped being about interesting matchups of skills, and started being more about ninjas making huge shuriken/energy constructs that nobody but other high tiers can do shit about :P"
StardustCrusaders,3cz9o9,ArabiaFats,2,Sun Jul 12 06:04:53 2015 UTC,"One of the things I really love about Jojo is how it was deliberately scaled down in Part 4. Until then, every arc had gone ""bigger"", just like you would expect. But Araki recognized that just continuing like that was self-defeating, so he chose a more personal theme for Diamond is Unbreakable, and sure enough, it's (in my opinion) the best Part."
StardustCrusaders,3cz9o9,enragedmanatee,2,Mon Jul 13 01:53:15 2015 UTC,"My opinion as well, and I agree on the point about scaling it down. Quite a few manga series suffered for their refusal to do that. Not only Naruto, but Yu Yu Hakusho, Dragon Ball, and I'm sure others made the battle powers of their heroes and villains skyrocket until techniques and tactics were mostly a moot point."
StardustCrusaders,3cz9o9,xmunstaaa,2,Mon Jul 13 01:55:16 2015 UTC,"Bleeeeaaaach.  At the start, Ichigo is a normal human who has weirdly high spirit energy and is given Shinigami powers by Rukia. So far, okay.   By this point, he's mastered Bankai, the ultimate technique so powerful that only ~13 other living Shinigami currently know it, become one of only three Shinigami ever to have a second sword capable of Bankai, and stolen the powers of no less than three other factions of supernatural being. And BEFORE he got many of these extra powers, he managed to almost single-handedly defeat a man who could and did beat every other high-ranking Shinigami in a single battle."

Of course the two series/stories went different ways...but the beginning of one of those is too similar to the other in many ways..."

Correct me if I'm wrong but it was one of the first mangas to introduce a unique ability system in the way that it did. Countless manga were influenced by this.

The stand is capable of letting out a battle cry of 「ZEFU ZEFU ZEFU」 while attacking. Die Antwoord can also activate a special power when the user is injured, 「Ugly Boy.」 When activated, the stand automatically leaves the user's side, and looks for suitable corpses. As quickly as possible, the stand can replace the wounded/lost parts of the user's body with the found corpse parts. (But not ""The Corpse Parts"" from SBR.) The newly attached parts will assimilate to the user's body, and can behave like a regular body part that is still alive. However, it is very apparent that it is connected to a new host, and any non Stand User will possibly note something incredibly ""off"" about replaced/healed parts. 「Ugly Boy」is only considered in effect while retrieving/attaching body parts.  Weaknesses: 「Ugly Boy」 causes two for the user. When in effect, the user is completely vulnerable to attack until 「Die Antwoord」 returns with whatever it retrieved. Another weakness is that when a limb is replaced, the stand must do so with another limb once a day, or the powers will wear off, and the limbs will start to decay.  Man this shit is creepy. One AM stand making sure is one hell of a ride."

But, usually it's better to buy figures online, as vendors will mark up prices at conventions.  If you see figures, make sure you do your research first! If you've got a smart phone/tablet/laptop, be sure to check MFC for pricing points (as well as counterfeits, if they exist) and check other retailers, like AmiAmi, HobbySearch, etc. It can be really fun to buy merchandise at conventions, just check around online first to make sure you're not overpaying!  I'm always happy to help you check online as well, figures are a hobby of mine~"

StardustCrusaders,3cwj75,sgtsnowman115,2,Sun Jul 12 00:39:23 2015 UTC,"Recently went to MCM London back in May, they were very difficult to find and I had to ask around a few stalls, those of which I did ask ended up saying they were quite hard to come across and it would cost them too much to get them imported over. In the end I found one stall which had a few and managed to pick a couple up there but it seems they aren't as popular as DBZ and Naruto just yet."

StardustCrusaders,3cvyim,highTrolla,15,Sat Jul 11 05:55:23 2015 UTC,"Some people abstain from reading it due to the loss of characterization that it suffered through the translation, but that in no way means it's not worth reading. I highly recommend reading it, as that would open up even more opportunities for discussion(which I'm sure is the reason you're here) of Jojo.  TL;DR, Read it, it's worth it if only for the in-jokes"
StardustCrusaders,3cvyim,levilee207,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:43:11 2015 UTC,"I say this and would add: even if it's not especially good, whenever they do make a better translation, you can be surprised all over again. I forgot the chapter number but I'm a ways after the White Album fight, and yeah it's not the best, but it's still OK. I just try to imagine how they might sound based on their expressions and it helps a bit."
StardustCrusaders,3cvyim,FeenieVonKarma,22,Mon Jul 13 14:13:44 2015 UTC,"It's translated well enough that you will understand what is going on. From what I've read on this sub the only thing that was lost was some characterization. You can totally read through it as well as understand, and than just keep up with the revised scans as they come out.  That said, you could skip part 5 and be able to read 6 without any issues."
StardustCrusaders,3cvyim,BLAHxBLAH,8,Sat Jul 11 06:05:08 2015 UTC,"Just got done reading part 5 yesterday, you can totally understand everything just fine if you're used to reading the previous parts trust me. Just part 5'll require more of your imagination than the previous ones and it takes a while for the story to pick up compared to the previous ones. But when it does, woo boy. Though I'd suggest you read up about the characters once again after you've read the manga to get their characteristics and personality. Asb's story mode was good enough for now for that purpose.   Don't skip it though no matter what, it's the best part I've read yet. My mind's still collecting it's pieces after being blown away by the end. God damn Araki."
StardustCrusaders,3cvyim,tokiwatomare,8,Sat Jul 11 10:30:35 2015 UTC,i think hes actually asking if the part 5 chapters after 484 are translated and available for reading.
StardustCrusaders,3cvyim,RexicTheKing,4,Sat Jul 11 11:57:47 2015 UTC,"Depends what you like about the series and how interested you are in it. People here will tell you to read it because you're in the JoJo subreddit but honestly if you try reading it and hate it there's no reason to force yourself unless you really care about getting the full story. Part 5 is very detached from the rest of the series you won't miss out on any details in part 6 if you skip it. Personally I really like the series and I thought it was worth it but it was still really tough to get through. It has some really crazy creative fights probably some of the best in the series and this is up to preference but I thought sticky fingers had one of the most interesting powers of any stand. The story and characterization are really lacking though, it's pretty bad.   TL;DR read it if you want to just see a series of really cool fights, if you want something deeper with good characterization and story then look elsewhere for now."
StardustCrusaders,3cvyim,ShamelessHipster,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:06:58 2015 UTC,"I loved Sticky Fingers, it's like the part 5 poster child for the Jojo theme of 'smart beats broken' imo. Zippers?? Fucking zippers? Really? Damn right, zippers can be badass."

StardustCrusaders,3cvyim,Yamazaru90,3,Sun Jul 12 02:22:14 2015 UTC,It's definitely better than nothing. Especially considering 484 just stops near the end of the arc.
StardustCrusaders,3cvyim,Berserker_Punk,3,Sun Jul 12 03:48:50 2015 UTC,Many thanks I was having the same problem
StardustCrusaders,3cvyim,Von_Stroheim,9,Sun Jul 12 12:12:29 2015 UTC,"Dont skip, read part 5 with its translations like everyone of use. It's worth."
StardustCrusaders,3cvyim,shauryab98,3,Sat Jul 11 06:02:42 2015 UTC,Just checked Batoto. The coloured ones are currently only available till 484 although Jojo's colored adventure is still working on them. You can read 485-594 by Ignition-one in black and white are there. Although I don't know if the translation is good enough(I'm currently on part 4).
StardustCrusaders,3cvyim,Mr_Flippers,2,Sat Jul 11 13:10:29 2015 UTC,"No, you'll have to slog through the rest of it whilst the coloured team keep working on it.  IF you want to skip, you won't miss out on anything in Part 6."
StardustCrusaders,3cvyim,Mykath,2,Sat Jul 11 15:32:19 2015 UTC,I read part 5 last exactly for this reason. I don't regret it but the bad translation does really deter from some of the enjoyment.  I still liked it but i read story for characters and fights and it feels half baked with the translation.   You can easily bypass it for now and keep up with the translation team as chapters come out. The biggest problem may be running into spoilers while you wait.
StardustCrusaders,3cvyim,enragedmanatee,7,Sat Jul 11 19:46:03 2015 UTC,"What you are about to read is an exceedingly unpopular opinion, and you probably had to dig it out from under at least 10-20 downvotes.  You really should just skip Part 5. For now, at least. Giorno is terribly uninteresting. His stand is constantly used as an excuse to arbitrarily ""raise the stakes"" by nearly killing almost the entire team every fight, only to have Golden Experience bring them back in increasingly implausible ways. Hell, thanks to this Giorno rarely even fights, he's always relegated to healer duty. Bruno does all the fighting, and admittedly Bruno is really cool but he cannot save clumsy writing and bad setups. Most of the enemies and even some of the main party members are horribly designed and very dull, and the main villain is alright but still probably the bottom ranking JoJo villain simply because all of the others are better.   There's maybe two things that happen in Part 5 that are wonderful, and it starts out pretty strong actually, but all in all it's a tiresome slog and a rare miss from Araki. It's not worth sitting through WHEN YOU STILL HAVE BETTER JOJO PARTS TO READ. It's still worth reading later, but it's completely irrelevant to parts 6 and 7 (and 8 if you count unfinished parts) and so much worse than both of them that you should really finish those and then backtrack. You don't gain anything from reading Part 5 first. There's no reason not to delay it.  And then, by the time you come back to it, perhaps a better translation will be completed."
StardustCrusaders,3cvyim,ArabiaFats,8,Sat Jul 11 08:55:48 2015 UTC,"I didn't downvote, because I like that you shared your opinion despite knowing how unpopular it would be. However, I disagree.  So Gold Experience can heal the party. So could Crazy Diamond. Araki's often gone as far as he plausibly could in hurting team members while still keeping them alive for the next fight. Giving an in-story answer to their being healed doesn't cheapen the fact that Bruno's gang gets banged up a lot during the part 5 fights.  I like SlimeStack's answer as to why Giorno doesn't fight as often as most JoJos. I personally enjoyed the fact that he was more behind-the-scenes - it was refreshing to have a character dynamic in which no one was explicitly labeled ""strongest."" The story isn't always dependent on the main character either.  Also, Giorno still participates in more fights than anyone in the part - Part 5. And Mista is tied with Bruno for second. The only one who really gets shafted is Fugo.  However, the biggest disagreement I have is that the enemies are dull. Compared with a great majority of part 3's baddies, as well as a good number of enemies from 4, the rival mobsters from 5 actually have a personal drive to carry out their mission, and display human emotions in doing so."

That being said, I feel in general while I love 4 and 5, 4-6 feel to similar and after reading them in a row I felt the same formula was being used over and over again. Leading 7 and 8 to be my favorites due to a different feel to them."

Minus Anasui, I like pretty much all of them and find them fairly dynamic and developed characters. Ermes and Foo Fighters are awesome sidekicks, Weather Report and Pucci have good characterization (although I think Pucci is too overpowered and consistently lucky to be one of my favorites), Emporio is just bizarre enough to be interesting, and Jolyne is probably my number 3 favorite Jojo."
StardustCrusaders,3cvyim,sorendiz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:00:36 2015 UTC,"I think Emporio just kind of blindsided me for the arc in general, i never really found myself enjoying him, but i guess he was there and i guess it made the ending pretty badass. I thought Weather Report and his whole arc + hidden ability + hidden hidden ability were rad, Ermes is top class, and while Anasui is a creepy bastard i absolutely loved Diver Down (probably because i'm a sucker for intangibility/phasing fights). My favorite thing about Jolyne is she has the ingenuity of Joseph, but she has to grow into it and i think her arc is second to only Johnny's or arguably second to none in terms of character dev."
StardustCrusaders,3cvyim,Khenir,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:59:20 2015 UTC,"I mean, why would you want to read glorious part 6 before you read what you think is the worst one though?  I really enjoyed part 5, the other members of the crew don't mill about being support characters that can't fight [like in part 3, where Jotaro is the winning factor of an overwhelming factor of the fights].  The bad part I could think of is a singlew plot hole with the Arrow, and what happens with Fugo [which is completely understandable]."
StardustCrusaders,3cvyim,sorendiz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:58:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly I would have enjoyed part 5 more if Gold Experience's powers were more clearly defined because I got tired of Giorno's fights being 'SURPRISE I KNEW YOU WOULD KNOW THAT I WOULD KNOW, SO HERE'S A THING GOLD EXPERIENCE DID OFFSCREEN'. Bruno was killer though, absolutely my favorite supporting fighter in any arc (some would argue he's the main hero even if Giogio is protag). My only regret is not enough Fugo, although understandable given Purple Haze."
StardustCrusaders,3cvyim,FeenieVonKarma,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:28:57 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I was kinda agreeing with this when I started to read it, but I stuck with it and I think it's one of my favourite group of characters in Jojo so far. Giorno is perhaps not 'uninteresting' but just super quiet. He hardly says anything, and in this way he just reminds me a lot of Jotaro. It doesn't bother me so much because I am always more interested in the supporting cast anyway.  But it's interesting to see how differing the opinions are on this part. I wonder if that would change if the translations were improved? I'm just happy there's a translation at all, and will also be happy to go back and read up on anything weird that was lost in translation."

StardustCrusaders,3csst7,Bobbybutts,8,Fri Jul 10 14:10:30 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll try a few. This is going to get really forced, but try to bear with me, if you want.  The rats with Ratt could work, and you could even be able to make a real character out of them, as in a character that has more than just ranged attacks. With both of the rats, you could have biting and stuff, or possibly using the Stand as a heavy object to shove people with.  The second most sensible one is Ken Oyanagi, with Boy II Man. The Stand looks like it could hit people if necessary (I mean, hell, Heaven's Door fought in All-Star Battle), and it could work as a Shang Tsung or Impostor Shinnok type of character with its specials. Maybe it has special moves that let it steal enemy moves, and its supers let it copy whole movesets, possibly with a buff or something.  Angelo with his Aqua Necklace could work, if he throws bottles of water at people or something.  Toshikazu Hazamada with Surface might sort of work. It would probably just work as Hazamada and Surface (imitating one of the other fighters in the match) double-teaming enemies and using all kinds of dirty tricks, and the specials could use the whole forced movement ability.  The last one I can think of is Mikitaka Hazekura with his Stand(?), Earth, Wind and Fire. He'd have a really funky-looking moveset, I imagine. Turning into various objects and flinging himself at people and doing all kinds of weird shit. In addition, they could really make him a team player sort of character, where he can turn into shoes or something and buff the other character, but that wouldn't make for very interesting gameplay for Mikitaka, even if there was some trap functionality there, where he could transform and attack at any moment.  Those are essentially the only ones that I can think of that aren't already in the game or mentioned in the OP."
StardustCrusaders,3csst7,VerryVerrynpoika,2,Fri Jul 10 14:34:23 2015 UTC,Wow I can't believe I forgot about Angelo since it's been so long!

StardustCrusaders,3csst7,VerryVerrynpoika,2,Fri Jul 10 16:10:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they could either have it be an actual game of rock-paper-scissors, or they could just have it be an automatic win for him. Or maybe it'd be like the clashes from Injustice, where both players have to bet a certain amount of their super meter to the match.  But those might come across as very gimmicky, so just having it be an automatic success for super moves might be a better choice, but I'm not a game designer so I'm not exactly an expert on this kind of stuff."
StardustCrusaders,3csst7,Tiresieas,4,Fri Jul 10 16:30:10 2015 UTC,"With the game being a 3d arena co-op fighting game, I maintain the stance that it would be cool to see more ""Support"" style characters (like the supports for the story/campaign mode in ASB). Someone who will change the flow of battle in their own unique way. I know Mariah and Bast were in the Capcom game as fighters, but I would see her and her Stand more as one of the support types instead of a combat type.  If we open the possibilities laid out by Echoes (Gravity effect) and Heaven's Door (""You cannot attack Rohan Kishibe"") in ASB and look at support style Stands and even Stands that confer an effect (Bast's magnetism), we could see characters like Hazamada and his Surface busting out the forced movement and mimicking another character's (non-Stand) moveset. So, I'll go through the characters of Duwang and see how they would fare, either as combat or support characters.  Angelo & Aqua Necklace (Combat Type, if anything) - Honestly, with N'Doul making his appearance, Angelo would just be a clone. Aqua Necklace's only gimmick was that it was bound to ""water"" and thus could take a steam (and presumably ice) form and that it otherwise had a humanoid form, unlike Geb. Unless there was something I misunderstood, Aqua Necklace was better at infiltration, but Geb was better at actual attacks, as Aqua Necklace could only really do damage from inside. In addition, Geb was closer to what became known as an automatic Stand, so it also has a huge range advantage over Aqua Necklace  Keicho Nijimura & Bad Company (Combat Type) - Unlike Angelo, Keicho wouldn't be a clone of Fatty, though they would probably have similar playstyles. Bad Company having a range of armaments, ranging from guns that can punch through human flesh, tanks and helicopters with weapons that can shatter The Hand's arm, means that they can have the standard lanes of attacks (low, mid, high). He would probably have a unique combo with Okuyasu as well.  Tamami Kobayashi & The Lock (Support/Effect Type) - To be honest,  The Lock would probably just be a Support version of Echoes ACT 3. Maybe he could lay down bags of (fake) kittens or some other trick to create guilt when someone runs them over, but then it slows the target down. I don't see him being included.  Toshikazu Hazamada & Surface (Support/Combat Type) - I already touched on Surface's use; copy a Stand user, gain their (non-Stand) moveset, movement mimicry, etc.   Tonio Trussardi & Pearl Jam (Support Type) - Pearl Jam isn't a combat Stand at all, and it would probably only serve to be a ""white mage"" archetypal Stand. Which isn't a bad thing, necessarily, but I can't see Tonio being a fighter in EoH.  Shizuka Joestar & Achtung Baby - dear god no  Ratt (Combat Type) - Well, we have a dog that can control sand, a bird that can generate and fire ice, why not have the rats that control Ratt? Firing the melting barb could be a long range attack, and have the rats do hostile rat things at close range.  Aya Tsuji & Cinderella (Support Type) - I think her ability could be pretty unique; buff her ally with a ""face change"" and debuff her enemies with another ""face change"".  Yoshihiro Kira & Atom Heart Father (Support/Combat Type) - If good ole' Daddy Kira got in, he could just float around in his photograph, shooting enemies with arrows, and buff his ally with the Arrow. Otherwise...? We could merge the two Kira variants by introducing him as a transformation ability, though with Kosaku-Kira's appearance change, the devs might have to be creative if they decide to use the David Bowie-Kira, otherwise we might have to settle for a Kosaku -> Bites The Dust Kosaku deal. But that would mean combining the two Kiras and doing weird things with the moveset (two separate ""GHAs"", Sheer Heart Attack and Bites the Dust, with the primary bomb of Bowie-Kira being a shared ""HHA""?), which would mean dropping Stray Cat and the ""I'll drive that into him like one of Joe Montana's touchdown passes!"" attack, which I think is pretty iconic of Kira.  Ken Oyanagi & Boy II Man - Unless his moveset is entirely ""counter"" moves (kind of like a lot of Diavolo's moves in ASB) that result in janken games, I can't see him making an appearance. Though, it would be funny, Ken would probably the Delibird of EoH, unfortunately, if he did make it in, since Boy II Man only seemed to do things during RPS.  Mikitaka Hazekura & ""Earth, Wind, & Fire"" (Combat/Support Type) - He seems like such a unique choice that the devs could have fun with, due to his shape shifting, but as a result he'd have a very obtuse moveset, which isn't a bad thing. He would probably be loads of fun.  Yuuya Fungami & Highway Star (Combat Type, Vampirism???) - Yuuya could be an interesting addition to the cast, and he might even have a unique form of vampirism (decreased health restore, but no ""silver health"" mechanic?). Definitely a long range user, protecting himself by using the distance between him and his target by having Highway Star attack and slow them down.  Toyohiro Kanedaichi & Superfly - no  Terunosuke Miyamoto & Enigma (Support Type) - Having ""fear"" as the driving factor behind Enigma's ability is the only issue, I think. Enigma lends itself to being a very active Support type Stand, actively punishing enemies by forcing them into paper, but the issue is how. I also like /u/ArabiaFats's ideas for Engima boy.  Cheap Trick - (Support Type) - I think Cheap Trick would lend itself more as a ""minigame"" where someone is ""it"", and the goal is to get someone to ""look at their back"", and last one standing wins. I don't see it being very good or balanced in the actual game; then again, we do have Stands like Heaven's Door and GER in the game, who are we to talk about balance    On the topic of Support Stands, we can open the doors to the Stands of other parts that didn't have much representation in ASB, particularly Steel Ball Run. And, with Pet Shop returning, we might also open the doors to unique movement methods, like Part 5"
StardustCrusaders,3csst7,battle777,3,Sat Jul 11 05:46:08 2015 UTC,I didn't follow the news but I'll be surprise if they didn't add Koichi and Kira.
StardustCrusaders,3csst7,noex1337,6,Fri Jul 10 14:28:15 2015 UTC,"Koichi was already added actually, but I was talking about NEW characters such as ones that weren't in ASB"
StardustCrusaders,3csst7,Starman-Deluxe,3,Fri Jul 10 14:32:34 2015 UTC,Didn't part 4 already have the most characters?
StardustCrusaders,3csst7,Delret51,8,Fri Jul 10 17:24:25 2015 UTC,"Stardust Crusaders had one more character than Diamond is Unbreakable.  Jotaro, Joseph, Avdol, Kakyoin, Polnareff, Iggy, Hol Horse, Vanilla Ice, Dio (9)  Josuke, Okuyasu, Koichi, Rohan, Shigechi, Akira, Kira, Kira (8)"
StardustCrusaders,3csst7,Starman-Deluxe,3,Fri Jul 10 19:47:52 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair Vanilla Ice, Iggy, and Oldseph were all DLC released at a later date."
StardustCrusaders,3csst7,ArabiaFats,3,Sat Jul 11 00:09:39 2015 UTC,"So were Kira and Shigechi. So overall:  Jotaro, Avdol, Kakyoin, Polnareff, Hol Horse, DIO (6)  Josuke, Okuyasu, Koichi, Rohan, Akira, Kira (6)  Welp."
StardustCrusaders,3csst7,MANSTA8,3,Sat Jul 11 00:20:12 2015 UTC,"I think Terunosuke Miyamoto and Enigma could make for a cool entry. He could attack by throwing traps stored in paper, or floating around the stage in a sheet of paper and firing his gun. His GHA could be doing something that scares the opponent, forcing them to show their fear tell, and getting them stored in paper/torn up."
StardustCrusaders,3csst7,trashygray,2,Fri Jul 10 15:08:34 2015 UTC,Kanedaichi and Super Fly would be the best addition to Eyes of Heaven by far.

StardustCrusaders,3crlkk,akeyjavey,17,Fri Jul 10 06:57:35 2015 UTC,"It's especially funny because the ""genderbended dio"" is a character named Eliza, who is based off of egyptian mythology, and uses it as part of her fighting style. Just like a certain other immortal egyptian. That isn't her standard colour palette though, it has to be unlocked.  ""neko-aigis"" is ""Robo Fortune,"" a robotic version of the character Ms. Fortune, who is a standard character in the game. The colour palette again is making a direct reference to Aigis. (Both Robo Fortune and Eliza are DLC."

The thing is, it's made by people who just absolutely love fighting games, and it shows. They put a ton of care in to every little detail on the gameplay side. Along with that a bunch of really good ideas that we can't tell you why it's a tiny indie studio coming with them."
StardustCrusaders,3crlkk,Nowhere_Man_Forever,-7,Fri Jul 10 14:40:32 2015 UTC,Ah. So it's sort of like Touhou project?
StardustCrusaders,3crlkk,WellComeToTheMachine,2,Fri Jul 10 14:51:00 2015 UTC,"Not really. Skullgirls is kinda hard to compare other games to.

Plus the music is great, same composer as classic Castlevania"

StardustCrusaders,3crlkk,SubstantialBliss,2,Sat Jul 11 11:34:58 2015 UTC,"I never understood this phrase. People have said ""Deviantart-tier/level"" so much I think it has no meaning, like they just use it to describe the art of something they don't like. What does that even mean? Does it mean it's bad, because it most certainly doesn't look bad. I notice people cry ""AH DEVIANTART"" just because it's not realistically painted or whatever. What makes it ""Deviantart""? It's like something has to be uber-realistic or painterly-looking and can't have an animesque style or it's supposedly bad."
StardustCrusaders,3crlkk,Nowhere_Man_Forever,-2,Sat Jul 11 02:04:26 2015 UTC,"I say ""DeviantArt level"" because all sorts of kids who are starting out use deviantart. After looking at it you're right the style is just ugly to me. At first glance it looked like low effort/ really early digital drawing mostly in the way it is colored and shaded. Either that or the singular art style furries seem to use. After looking at it for a bit it looks like there is indeed a lot of detail and effort, I just really dislike the art style as it reminds me of way more low budget animation."

StardustCrusaders,3cpzcx,BlazingSakura,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:01:56 2015 UTC,That's the lowest I've seen anyone rate part 4. What don't you like about it? Not judging just wondering.
StardustCrusaders,3cpzcx,Nowhere_Man_Forever,3,Fri Jul 10 12:46:36 2015 UTC,"Oh, I don't think it is judging at all! I think the more simplistic and toned down conflict didn't appeal to me quite as much as the three parts I put before it, and I thought the story was a little slow and disconnected until Kira showed up, and even then it still broke out into some kind of random stand battles that amounted to nothing. I should point out though that it is less of a matter of not liking it, as simply not liking it as much. I still love the characters and the fun set-ups and stand users, I just thought 2, 6, and 7 did their tales a touch better."
StardustCrusaders,3cpzcx,BlazingSakura,3,Fri Jul 10 18:20:58 2015 UTC,8>7>4>2>1>5>3>6  I love all the parts but 6 and half of 3. Stone Ocean was the only part I genuinely didn't like and read it fast to get it over with
StardustCrusaders,3cpzcx,FatiguedWalri,7,Fri Jul 10 04:33:41 2015 UTC,"8=4>7>6>3>1>2>5  8 and 4 are too great to go into detail without ranting  7 is also fantastic, but is only beaten by 4 due to having more parts that I wasn't as interested in whereas the only time I felt anything was kind of ""filler"" (and not the amazing SoL way it usually is) in Part 4 was the Superfly fight.  When 6 upped the ante it did it better than most other parts; and Jolyne is one of the better JoJos and her learning her stand felt really organic.  Stardust really only gets up here because of the Egypt Arc and its characters.  I love Jonathan and his personal drama with Dio. Whilst the usual JoJo format of outsmarting to win is more enjoyable to read, Jonathan's moral victories are just beautiful to see. Even Speedwagon cries.  I love Kars, I love Joseph, I love the Whammu fights, but Part 2 doesn't hold up as well for me. It's by no means bad, it's just that I find a lot of other parts better. I never really got Caesar and Joseph's connection and the Pillar Men are poorly written characters. That being said there are some very, very creative fights in here and that deserves a special mention.  Part 5 has a lot of problems and I've spoken about them many, many times"
StardustCrusaders,3cpzcx,Mr_Flippers,3,Fri Jul 10 01:23:08 2015 UTC,"That's pretty confident to put part 8 as number one when it's not even finished yet. I rated it second as a tie with part four, mostly because who knows Araki might fuck it up next issue or something. I really do love part 8 though, and I do predict it will be at least tied for part 4 for me. I think it's pretty cool that not only has this manga been going on for nearly 30 years without becoming shit but that it also has managed to get better."
StardustCrusaders,3cpzcx,Nowhere_Man_Forever,6,Fri Jul 10 16:17:34 2015 UTC,"I really, really like Part 8. Gappy is one of my favourite JoJos; and perhaps this is a silly bias but I feel really connected to this part since I'm finally reading a part that is set in today's time. But again, it is tied with Part 4 so far and probably will be even when it's finished. I loved the close-knit suburban camaraderie feel that Part 4 gave and the really close to home horror of Yoshikage Kira, but I feel like Part 8 will go for an over the top Stone Ocean kind of ending. I could wind up liking Part 4 more in the end because of those things though and it's gonna take a while before its done (didn't Part 7 go for like 7-8 years?). Part 4 and 8 connect with me personally, but Part 8 has a bit of an edge due to being set today. Again, it's why I have an equal sign because so far there really is no telling which is better yet.  Also I put 8 at the front so that if you wanted to discount it you can and it doesn't mess up the flow."
StardustCrusaders,3cpzcx,Mr_Flippers,5,Sat Jul 11 02:48:44 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, this got longer than I expected.  ""Which part is the best?"" is a pretty loaded question since it ultimately comes down to personal taste. Also I assume most people in the west haven't had access to a good version of Vento Aureo (the only good translations are the official French and Italian releases), so people's opinions about that part tend to be skewed thanks to the mishandled translations and weak scans.  Personally, for me it's:  7 > 4 > 6 > 3 > 5 > 2 > 1  I excluded 8 because although it's been interesting so far and I've enjoyed the more creative stands and alternate universe aspect of it, it hasn't progressed much so I don't really have that strong an opinion.  Focusing on the finished parts:  7 is the pinnacle of the series for me in terms of art, characters, story and pacing. It was an experience to read from start to finish and there's practically nothing I'd change about it. 4 is close behind - creative stands, great battles, great cast. I know a lot of people dislike 6 but even for its weak points (slow start and a few boring battles) I still loved it, Pucci best antagonist.   3 has that very grating 'Stand of the Week' setting but I grew to love the characters and that made up for it. 5 has an interesting cast, but I wish I could reread it with better scans and translation - I'd probably appreciate it more. 2 has my favorite Jojo and seeing Joseph bullshit out of things is a joy, but as much as I like the characters I don't think the plot is that great or relevant to the series as a whole.   Part 1 is great only because Dio is such an asshole and that pretty much carries the whole story by its own - but the battles are boring and a pain to get through.  With that said there isn't a single part I actively dislike or would recommend skipping over. They all have their merits and I don't think the JJBA experience is complete if you haven't read them all."

StardustCrusaders,3cpzcx,arittz,3,Thu Jul 9 21:53:35 2015 UTC,I just like SO more because Jolyne is a better JoJo.
StardustCrusaders,3cpzcx,mrminun,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:17:15 2015 UTC,I loved Giorno's stand ability way more than Jolyne's but his character was just so bland.
StardustCrusaders,3cpzcx,HattyMikune,6,Thu Jul 9 23:40:47 2015 UTC,"Well, I think that it wasn't a matter of Giorno's character falling short, but rather Araki focusing on other characters more. It really was less about the JoJo than other parts. Giorno's personality is rather interesting to me, when his backstory is taken into account: He's cold, calculated, and blunt. This doesn't mean that he's emotionless, though, since he does show Passione in what he does, and devotion to his allies. Probably because his father left him and his mother, so Gio had to deal with a lot more growing up, especially since he was in a particularly gang-y area of the country. This caused him to wear less emotion on his face. Not because he has ""Jotaro Syndrome"" where he wants to be edgy and rebellious, but because you could literally be hunted down for having the wrong look on you. You could also say the same caused him to be so focused. If you leave a job half-done in a gang-y area, wouldn't that signal to the criminals that you aren't someone that ""deserves their protection?""   However, a point working against Gio would be that his premise (JoJo, but DIO'S SON??? WHAT? INTRIGUING!) was sorta ruined by the trio of degenerates DIO'S sons in Stone Ocean. They made Giorno's existence less cool than it was initially. (Is it possible to retcon awesome points?)  And on the topic of stand abilities: I think that you're mistaking usefulness for variety, here. Giorno's stand is extremely varied, with many possible uses. He can literally turn anything into any animal that exists. With the exception of humans. Part 5 Ending Spoilers Jolyne's powers are limited to string, which is still useful, sure, but it isn't as varied or interesting as Giorno's stand. Stone free isn't meant to be a fighter, really. Remember that Giorno intrinsically knew to fight with Gold Experience, but Jolyne had to willingly manifest Stone Free's body. This means that Giorno was more familiar with his stand right off the bat at his part's events. This might contribute to the ""better than Stone Free"" aspect.  This got long. Oops."
StardustCrusaders,3cpzcx,mrminun,2,Fri Jul 10 01:16:16 2015 UTC,Possibly humans too. He was regenerating peoples' organs all the time.
StardustCrusaders,3cpzcx,ArabiaFats,2,Fri Jul 10 01:41:48 2015 UTC,"Well that doesn't count as a full on human, since Gio's power was technically accelerating life's speed. While it worked on generating animals, I suppose it works to heal. I like to think that his power is limited, so he can't create people, but bits and parts of people. Giorno for Frankenstein confirmed"

Part 7 is high on my list due to both the different style of the story and stands in it which are a refreshing touch to the series to say the least. Probably the best for an overall, consistent quality.   Part 6 would probably be higher if it didn't loose intensity during the middle of it. Jolyne is a great protagonist and one who we genuinely get to see develop during the course of the part.    While being a fantastic part by itself, Part 2 for me really has a nostalgic value to it. Part 1 was what got me interested in JoJo but Part 2 made me fall in love with it. Joseph is easily one of my favorite Joestar's yet and his fight against Whammu is still one of the best in the entire series for me.   Part 3 and Part 5 are both incredible parts however they both have glaring weaknesses. Part 3 prior to Egypt was fairly enjoyable but managed to get a little tedious after a while which wasn't helped by the relatively mediocre enemy stands. It was boosted up though thanks to the Joestar group who were fantastic and also by DIO who still is one of my all time favorite villains. Part 5 on the other hand was weak for me mainly thanks to the main antagonist and protagonist. Buccellati's Gang made up for them though with characters like Mista and Buccellati being personal favorites of mine. The fights were amazing to read through although they could get confusing at times which is a shame given the sheer creativity of them.   Part 1 is of course great but for me it just doesn't really stand up next to the other parts. The battles are a bit boring at times and Jonathan isn't all too fantastic compared to the other Joestars.   Favorite Antagonist: Yoshikage Kira. Funny Valentine and Pucci would be second and third respectively.  Favorite Joestar: Josuke (Part 4). Joseph and Jolyne are a close second"

StardustCrusaders,3cpzcx,Seligsuper,2,Fri Jul 10 05:13:03 2015 UTC,"7=6>2>8>4>1>3>5  Steel Ball Run and Stone Ocean are my favorite parts by far, their story is interesting, it keeps a nice pace throughout, and watching both Jolyne and Johnny grow as people is really interesting to see. The supporting cast is really solid and the fights are a spectacle in their own right.  Battle Tendency is enjoyable for Joseph's goofiness and how he bullshits most of his fights but still comes out on top anyway. An enjoyable protagonist with enjoyable antagonists, and a gut-punch in the form of Ceaser's death makes this one of my favorites.  Jojolion I'm enjoying so far. It has this air of mystery that hasn't let up for a second in the time it's being published. I fear however that the part will hinge on the actual reveal and as a result subsequent reads will be less effective. I'm holding out for the antagonist doing something amazing once he or she appears.  Diamond is Unbreakable I like and dislike. While it has some interesting characters and arguably the best Jojo villain to date, it focuses too much on filler for me to stay interested. There was barely any plot until Kira came along and even then later chapters still found ways to goof off and do things that aren't plot relevant and will never be brought up again after its done.  Phantom Blood I give some slack because although it is generic and has stereotypical characters throughout, it's also the starting part to all of this madness so I can't be mad at it. As a starting point it works fine, as a part by itself it's generic and forgettable.  Stardust Crusaders I didn't enjoy until the Egypt arc. The inclusion of Iggy screams too little too late since he dies after his one major fight. While the other characters are nice and varied you have Jotaro as the main character which as far as main characters go he isn't terrible, but once you see the other Jojos and their personalities Jotaro sticks out and not in a good way. He works better as a side character in my opinion. Again, he's not a bad character, he's just not interesting enough to keep me invested.  Vento Aureo has one likable character and almost nothing else. I like Giorno as a character and I think he got shafted for imo the least interesting characters in the whole series. A bunch of stereotypical anime characters that leads to nothing interesting by the end (except for Polenareff getting turned into a turtle.) I like Diavolo as a villain but he wasn't enough to save the part for me."

StardustCrusaders,3cpzcx,StarNomad,2,Fri Jul 10 21:41:10 2015 UTC,"First 5 I love the fights in part 5 and how the main group are really good friends and you can see that trough out the part. I didnt really have a problem with the translation either because of my dyslecsia i have problems noticing mistakes in texts so the mistakes wasnt noticed before people pointet it out for me.  Second 7 I love part 7 also but i dont feel it reaches part 5 from my perspective, but one of my high points with part 7 is how johnny and zeppelies relationship grew trough out the part. and how they came over challenges since johnny wasnt the one that had every thing under controll and he doupted himself, and i found that refreshing.  Third 6 I like this part since i think jolyne is a great character and i liked seeing how she handeld herself when she was put in situatuions she didnt know much/anything about. But the bad part about part 6 is that i feels slow at some points compared to the other parts.  Fourth 2 I love joseph and the pillar men in this part, but my mi uses with the part is that it is a bit short for my taste or it feelt a bit short, and i didnt really like the artstyle to much at that part in the manga since it looked somewhat dirty.  Fifth 4 I do like part 4, but i dont find it as memorable as the other parts before it.  Sixth 3 I found part 3 slow and boring most of the time exept at the end of it since i didnt enjoy the new week new bad guy aspect of it.  Seventh 1 This is my least favourit part. Im not saying its bad it just feels like the most generic one, but i guess thats because Araki was still toying with ideas from how he wantet jojo to be from what i understand."
StardustCrusaders,3cpzcx,potetman123,2,Sat Jul 11 00:30:09 2015 UTC,"2>4>7>3>5>1>6 (Doesn't feel right to rate Part 8 until it's finished)  Battle Tendency may be short, but goddammit I love every single part of it. Joseph is incredible, the Pillar Men are terrifying, Lisa Lisa and Caesar are awesome, and the fights are all insane.  Diamond is Unbreakable has a really lovable cast of characters, both good and bad, and I love the more slow feel of the part. Also has my favorite final battle.  Steel Ball Run has two of my favorite protagonists, a lot of great fights, and the most interesting plot so far, but it loses points for the last act following Valentine's death. The whole alternate Diego thing was dumb, and the ending was unsatisfactory.  Stardust Crusaders is the middle of the road. Main characters are likeable but kinda bland and underused at times. Some of the battles are really awesome (D'arby the Gambler, Vanilla Ice, Anubis, and of course DIO), while others...not so much (Ebony Devil, Wheel of Fortune).  Vento Aureo is really similar to Stardust Crusaders, with similar strengths and weaknesses. I think a lot of the battles are actually among the best in the series, and most of the Stands are really great, but the plot leaves a lot to be desired, and the characters (save Buccelati) are flatter than warm soda.  Phantom Blood certainly comes off as simplistic nowadays, and the first few chapters are an utter slog to get through, but its not without its high points. Namely Speedwagon and all of his awesomeness.  I freaking love Jolyne Kujo and everything about her character and fighting Style, but the rest of Stone Ocean kinda falls flat for me. The rest of the characters are boring, the Stand battles drag on for way too long, and goddamn Pucci is the worst villain JoJo has ever had."

Part 8's position is based upon where it is currently and where I predict it will go, and it might change. Part 3 and part 6 are nearly on the same level for me but Part 3 is just slightly ahead due to DIO, and it makes me sad to put part 6 in the bottom half of the list because I really love it. Part 2 is really good but too short to be higher. Part 5 is better than most people say, but I didn't like it as much as other parts. To me, it got a bit too ridiculous even by JoJo standards. Part 1 is lowest because it is so different from the rest of the series. I like it, but it's not as good as other parts."

Well, at least 7 had AMAZING artwortk, while 8 is kind of average. Maybe Araki is busy with other projects, or just wants to take it slowly as he is getting older and probably can't keep up the pace after so many years, and I can't blame him.

For those few seconds he can have anyone he wishes entirely at his command without them having the slightest chance of stopping him.

That, and it does kind of allow him to turn any urban vessel into his own personal ""jungle."" It has no personality because Forever is insecure about his own intelligence in comparison to that of humans.  J. Geil is ugly, to the point I believed he was a vampire or another sort of monster when I looked at artwork of him before reading the series proper. Hanged Man residing in a mirror, I guess, might be a manifestation of J's spite for people admiring their own good looks. In addition to his obvious killing instinct.  The D'Arby brothers, just like Alessi, seem to truly enjoy making people feel weak in comparison to them. And even moreso than turning enemies into children, turning them into possessions allows them to hold on to this feeling of superiority for an indefinite time. Also, I imagine they developed their stands, like Tonio, out of mastering their skill of choice (games)."

Another Stand like this is The Hand, the stand of Okuyasu Nijimura. The whole reason that that the Nijimura brothers were going around making stand users was to kill their father, who had been transformed into a nigh unkillable monster by Dio. And this was the desire of Okuyasu, and his stand was able to do just that. But when push came to shove, he was unable to pull a Polnareff (see Judgement fight) and become a badass. Such tragically wasted potential."

StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,SiberskEsto,38,Tue Jul 7 20:02:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they've done really well and it's very obvious they are big fans of the series. Only problem I have with them is it seems they didn't spread their budget out well enough and somewhat wasted it in earlier episodes rather than saving a bunch for Dio's World. Dio's World was good but there were definitely some QUALITY shots that shouldn't have been there."
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,_meppz,18,Tue Jul 7 20:36:41 2015 UTC,"Now that they're done animating, I'm hoping they go over the top on redrawing for the last bd's"
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,MetallicKaiser,50,Tue Jul 7 21:19:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like DP did the best that anyone could do, and I can't think of any studio that could have done it better. I do think Bones could have done really well, though."
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,Ganmorg,16,Tue Jul 7 20:10:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe the later few. I can see them pulling off bishounen Jotaro very well, and just imagine how they might animate Part 6!   Bones is fantastic when it comes to lithe, young men..."
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,The_Queen_in_Yellow,13,Tue Jul 7 22:23:32 2015 UTC,part 5 would be their bread and butter then
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,bitcheslovedroids,6,Tue Jul 7 23:18:36 2015 UTC,"I think MadHouse could do a pretty good job as well, adaptations seem to be their thing"
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,LastElemental,15,Wed Jul 8 01:36:57 2015 UTC,"This is more of an aside, as I believe David Production has successfully adapted JoJo, but the art style of the series is not as faithful as I would have liked it. I feel like it would have been incredibly impressive to have created Araki's style full-on, yet that may be more of a technical limitation.  Either way, like I said, David Production did a super job in creating a current Day JoJo anime. Hope they get the chance to go beyond Part 3."

StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,redheaded_robot,4,Tue Jul 7 22:44:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for reminding me that DD Hokuto no Ken still exists ;_;
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,Jetsfantasy,2,Wed Jul 8 05:03:47 2015 UTC,I liked it! Have you heard about Ichigo Aji?
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,redheaded_robot,3,Wed Jul 8 05:08:10 2015 UTC,"No, I haven't... reads link Oh god, Souther going where he doesn't belong, that sounds way too funny. I may need to check that out.   I may have to look past the shift in artstyle and try DD, that art style just made me very uncomfortable, going from the source art style and then seeing the super deformed style was just so offputting."
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,Jetsfantasy,2,Wed Jul 8 05:18:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was a little weird at first, but the humor is pretty good, and it's enjoyable if you treat it for what it is, a silly spinoff ^^ IIRC, Kenshiro's voice actor plays Ryuuken in DD, which is kind of neat!"
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,redheaded_robot,7,Wed Jul 8 05:22:38 2015 UTC,"I think it's insane that this adaptation was so well made, and included so much detail, for such a small studio. Obviously, different studios have different styles, and a bigger studio could have had a bigger budget to work with, but JoJo has been one of my favorite shows to watch when based on the actual technical details, not just because I love JoJo -- David proved themselves worthy when they finished Part 1. It's been a wild, amazing ride since then."
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,MrOneHundredOne,9,Tue Jul 7 21:44:49 2015 UTC,"I can't think of anyone that could have done it better. My only criticisms are the pacing being all over the place in Part 3, as well as the fact that they somewhat blew the budget early on. Hopefully the BDs will correct some animation mistakes.  tl;dr: Yes, they certainly have."
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,TheRealSlimSaiyan,3,Tue Jul 7 21:51:40 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, definitely, after watching Phantom Blood I went back to the manga and it is very impressive how close it was, same goes for the rest of the parts they did. And they were able to rake in a ton of new fans."
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,Metotaku,5,Wed Jul 8 00:33:42 2015 UTC,I genuinely think we're blessed that the stars aligned and brought David and JoJo together. I cannot think of an anime so god damned fateful and full of spirit. From the sound effects to the alternate color palettes to the gorgeous openings and endings. It's just all too perfect.   Only adaptation that comes close is probably Death Note. Another expertly adapted show with incredible attention to detail.
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,snailord,4,Wed Jul 8 02:12:56 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah. So so many studios have butchered great mangas for one reason or another and there hasn't been one point where I thought DP wasn't giving JoJo the respect it deserves. It did everything right, and it is beautiful."
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,BlazingSakura,4,Wed Jul 8 02:49:10 2015 UTC,"I thought it was pretty good, since I came into the anime before the manga. My only issue is that a lot of episodes that were 2-parters didn't seem to need to be split up for any reason other than matching as many scenes as they needed to. D'arby the Gambler seems the most notable of this issue, but a few episodes did it. Of course, I'm sure if some details were cut for time there would be people upset their favorite part was removed, so this probably worked out better."
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,ibbolia,5,Tue Jul 7 21:04:44 2015 UTC,Same. I really feel like the pacing was way too slow and iffy for the egypt arc.
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,Pistachiothenut,2,Tue Jul 7 21:32:29 2015 UTC,I was okay with D'arby being a two parter because it's my favorite fight in part 3. The most notable offender that I can think of is the Lovers fight.
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,Wellhelloat,10,Wed Jul 8 04:49:34 2015 UTC,"I still think ""ROAD ROLLER"" should have exploded. It's iconic at this point, even if it doesn't make any sense"
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,noex1337,19,Tue Jul 7 21:23:53 2015 UTC,"Didn't happen in the manga, though. The exploding Road Roller was a feature from the fighting game (in order to clear the screen of the special move after it was complete); I think in the OVA they used an oil tanker because they wanted an explosion, and a road roller wouldn't make sense?   Anyway it doesn't explode in the manga, and I honestly think it has much more tension with the idea that Spoiler"
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,MrOneHundredOne,-7,Tue Jul 7 21:59:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it exploded in both games, the old school flash animation, and the OVA (kinda). Didn't need to make sense, it's jojo"

StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,Pistachiothenut,3,Tue Jul 7 21:46:10 2015 UTC,"You kid but that is actually how the physics involved work. Enough kinetic energy transferred to an object will heat it to extreme levels and cause the atoms to tear themselves free of each other as they generate extreme friction.  You, the puncher, blow up too though. Sucks to suck.  TL;DR if you punch shit at high enough speed it really does blow up."
StardustCrusaders,3cgrn6,Wellhelloat,4,Wed Jul 8 04:47:58 2015 UTC,Sure. I don't think I can think of a studio that would do a better job.

StardustCrusaders,3chabl,Luxferres,3,Wed Jul 8 04:00:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you! And yeah, more or less. Before I took up this hobby I had learned at least basic sewing from a very young age; part of being a girl in a rather traditional family. Most of what I knew was quite basic (simple mending, embroidery, aprons, etc) though, so early cosplay taught me most of my garment making skills, and I only started seriously challenging myself (and therefore improving fastest) in 2007 when I started making JoJo designs."

StardustCrusaders,3cifuw,OpenStraightElephant,2,Wed Jul 8 07:04:01 2015 UTC,"It probably is intentional. Like, you're naming an Arab. Name it with the most common arab name you can think of."
StardustCrusaders,3cifuw,Zekromaster,10,Mon Jul 13 10:29:46 2015 UTC,"It's supposed to be ""Abdul"" because of the music reference to Paula Abdul. ""Avdol"" is generally used in official translations to avoid issues with copyright, but I think his name miiight be spelled like that in one of the art books. I'm not sure."
StardustCrusaders,3cifuw,Shoyren,7,Wed Jul 8 04:25:42 2015 UTC,"Are we sure it's to avoid copyright? ""Abdul"" is a common name, it'd be really hard to claim copyright over it.   ""Avdol"" could just be how Araki wanted it, like with Wammu and Straizo."
StardustCrusaders,3cifuw,Seamus_McSuperfly,2,Wed Jul 8 06:22:56 2015 UTC,It either references Paula Abdul or Muhammad Abdu
StardustCrusaders,3cifuw,Metotaku,2,Wed Jul 8 11:29:59 2015 UTC,"Given the official kana and this, it seems like the name is Avdol but a reference to Paula Abdul.  Similar to how ""The Hand"" is a reference to ""The Band"" because, in writing, the only difference is a diacritic."
StardustCrusaders,3cifuw,TheLoneJack,7,Fri Jul 10 22:40:10 2015 UTC,The official kana is アヴドゥル/Avdul apparently so everyone's half right. :P

StardustCrusaders,3cifuw,MaxIsAlwaysRight,3,Fri Jul 10 04:40:04 2015 UTC,It's spelled with a V in Japanese. Anyone translating ヴ as B is objectively wrong. I swear half of these translators don't even look at the Japanese name when translating.
StardustCrusaders,3cifuw,SlimeStack,-1,Wed Jul 8 12:04:36 2015 UTC,"Well, they don't have B in Japanese. But Abdul is a real surname, and Mohammed Abdul is like John Doe or Mario Rossi. Alias, A FUCKING COMMON NAME."
StardustCrusaders,3cifuw,Zekromaster,2,Mon Jul 13 10:28:57 2015 UTC,Where on earth did you hear that there's no B in Japanese? Of course there's a B. There's 5 of them in fact.  I don't know why you're so set on Avdol having a common name either. Is Zeppelli a common name? Is Joestar a common name? Since when does Araki use common names?
StardustCrusaders,3cifuw,SlimeStack,-1,Mon Jul 13 10:52:45 2015 UTC,"The B part was a misconception on my side. But fact it, ""Mohammed Abdul"" is the most common Arab name, and considering who he references, it's logical to say his name is Abdul."
StardustCrusaders,3cifuw,Zekromaster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:13:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you're acting like there's a debate. If Araki wanted it to be Abdul, he would have spelled it Abdul. He chose Avdol because he wanted it to be spelled Avdol. It's the same as how Zeppelli is not spelled Zeppellins, Wamuu is not spelled Wham, or Straizo is not spelled Straits."
StardustCrusaders,3cifuw,SlimeStack,3,Mon Jul 13 11:15:34 2015 UTC,Yes! I am!
StardustCrusaders,3cifuw,BlackbirdSR71C,4,Wed Jul 8 17:28:59 2015 UTC,"For me, it's not even a choice. Abdul is an actual name while Avdol is a broken engrish version of that name."
StardustCrusaders,3cifuw,Newsuperstevebros,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:18:00 2015 UTC,"Absolutely this. I've met several Abduls in my life. Some (very) quick research into censuses from the mid-to-late-20th century seems to show that Avdol didn't (or doesn't) even seem to exist as a surname. Take that how you will, I guess."
StardustCrusaders,3cifuw,PiGreat,2,Wed Jul 8 16:04:56 2015 UTC,Here's your answer.
StardustCrusaders,3cifuw,PilariousD,2,Wed Jul 8 17:25:23 2015 UTC,"I'd take it as Abdul. I think it's written as Avdol because of the way Japanese people would pronounce it more like Abdul (at least that's what it sounds like in the anime). I think that goes the same with Telence D'Arby, because Terrence is an actual name, while Telence isn't really."
StardustCrusaders,3cifuw,SmegmanHoarder,2,Wed Jul 8 21:55:30 2015 UTC,"Abdul is an actual name, so it seems like it should be Abdul, but I can't call him anything but Avdol because dammit that's what I'm used to."

StardustCrusaders,3cedzy,Ganmorg,17,Tue Jul 7 20:08:15 2015 UTC,"I don't like this Joseph. I never really actually picture him with an english accent. Obviously he would have one, but I always pictured him having more...of an outstanding tone to his voice. This is a voice I could picture with Jonathan, but not Joseph. But hey, just my opinion!"
StardustCrusaders,3cedzy,VictorShade1,34,Tue Jul 7 07:40:46 2015 UTC,I feel like there's no playfulness with his voice and that's my beef. The focus was too much on his accent and not enough on his personality.
StardustCrusaders,3cedzy,Scoodlebap,17,Tue Jul 7 14:41:07 2015 UTC,I agree. He just sounds too bored or calm. The Japanese voice is full of emotion and it really fits Joseph.

Speedwagon invited them to America, I think it was to tell them about Santana but idk. It wouldn't make sense for him to have an American accent unless they weren't using accents at all."

StardustCrusaders,3cedzy,Scotsman333,6,Tue Jul 7 11:58:01 2015 UTC,maybe! Though my dad is 67 and he still has his accent

StardustCrusaders,3cfio6,razorbeamz,47,Tue Jul 7 14:48:24 2015 UTC,Kakyoin and Polnareff communicate using sign language.
StardustCrusaders,3cfio6,fellatious_argument,10,Tue Jul 7 18:56:09 2015 UTC,"""Sign Language"""
StardustCrusaders,3cfio6,MedicMelvin,29,Wed Jul 8 04:07:00 2015 UTC,I would say English since it's the only language that every character could feasibly speak. Most foreign words they say are in English too.
StardustCrusaders,3cfio6,SlimeStack,20,Tue Jul 7 14:52:35 2015 UTC,"I assumed English:   Joseph explicitly greeted a man in Arabic at the beginning of Justice, but other than that we can only assume he knows English because that's what he'd speak in the US/UK. We know Dio speaks English for the same reasons as Joseph. He seems like he'd want people to speak his language, rather than bother to learn another. Abdul could know some of a number of languages from working as a fortune-teller in Khan el-Khalili (which is a tourist attraction in Cairo according to wikipedia) but met through Joseph & understood Dio, so I assume he's almost fluent in English. Holly know English, being Joseph's daughter, but the prison guards at the beginning complimented Holly on her ability to speak Japanese. Holly's unseen husband is also Japanese, so let's assume Jotaro is at least English/Japanese bilingual. Next is Kakyoin, who we know is Japanese too. We all know English is more popular in Japan than Japanese is in the west & he does speak directly with other characters that we know speak English, such as when Dio spoke with him on his family trip to Egypt. Polnareff is probably a similar case as Kakyoin, but speaks French natively rather than Japanese. The Speedwagon foundation is their biggest resource. While we know little about it, it's international & could have easily determined the route the group took from Japan to Egypt. This would allow the SPW to provide them with resources & possibly had prior knowledge of places that would have someone who could speak either English or Japanese to a useful degree."
StardustCrusaders,3cfio6,FriendFrog,11,Tue Jul 7 19:30:44 2015 UTC,"Kakyoin is also implied to be an honors student destined for a good university. He's very smart, and I assume this means that he's studious in his English classes. He met DIO in Cairo when on a trip with his family, showing he's well-travelled and could talk to DIO."
StardustCrusaders,3cfio6,whisperHailHydra,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:05:22 2015 UTC,I can't think of a reason of why would Polnareff speak Japanese at all.
StardustCrusaders,3cfio6,mudamudamudamuda,11,Sun Jul 12 04:19:16 2015 UTC,Canon-wise I'm certain they spoke English. Although I did see a pretty interesting video of the OVA where they took all of the different dubs and put them together so that everyone spoke their native language. (Polnareff had the French dub) (Avdol had the Arabic) (Joseph had English) and (Jotaro and Kakyoin had the OG Japanese). EDIT: Added Video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgz0Lvn2d8I

StardustCrusaders,3cfio6,CMAX10,3,Tue Jul 7 19:18:48 2015 UTC,Avdol wasn't speaking Arabic at all in that video BTW. At least not in the first lines he was speaking (I stopped watching after that).
StardustCrusaders,3cfio6,iKsaGAM3R,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:28:18 2015 UTC,"I am not sure they had an Arabic Dub, in the video I watched they switched his dub every time he stopped speaking."

StardustCrusaders,3cfio6,ArabiaFats,2,Tue Jul 7 19:46:48 2015 UTC,It's definitely not spanish might be Portuguese.
StardustCrusaders,3cfio6,BryanCV,7,Tue Jul 7 22:35:23 2015 UTC,"Could be either English or Japanese, but probably mostly English since I highly doubt a Frenchman like Polnareff learned Japanese. It is possible Jotaro and Kakoyin also spoke Japanese to each other or Joseph while speaking English in other instances."
StardustCrusaders,3cfio6,BlazingSakura,3,Tue Jul 7 16:16:44 2015 UTC,I always they were multi-linguistic and spoke the language of wherever they were. Maybe just Abdul and Joseph were and the rest spoke english but it seemed like they knew a lot about the cultures beforehand.

StardustCrusaders,3cfio6,wolfguardian72,2,Tue Jul 7 15:41:53 2015 UTC,"I'd say English, Joseph and Dio know it for obvious reasons, Avdol is a learned man so he probably knows it, and Polanerff, Jotaro, and Kakoyin all probably learned English in school."
StardustCrusaders,3cfio6,jalford312,2,Tue Jul 7 20:05:51 2015 UTC,"Assuming they all speak one language, it's probably English.

If you take a dollar from a stack of bills, the stack of bills would be full again, but you would still have taken that dollar and would be holding it.

StardustCrusaders,3cen93,cerulis,7,Tue Jul 7 15:36:26 2015 UTC,"Name: Mr Self Destruct. But thanks to his nature, it goes for many names  Power: D  Range: It doesn't matter where the 'victim' is as long the lie is told directly to them.  Speed: Acts instantly.  Durability: C  Potential: A  The user can only lie. If he sucessfully deceive a person 3 times in a row, this person will become the users puppet. Once this happens the user gains information of the puppet memories, stand, and can give it 3 orders that (must be related to his lies) and be followed without judgement.  If a person hear a 'truth' from him, his stand will have no effect on that person whatsoever.  It is worth noting that just comentating a lie isn't enough, he must directly deceive his victim.   For example:  Saying to somebody that his bank password is 1234, if the person just ignore him his stand will have no effect nor start acting."
StardustCrusaders,3cen93,cerulis,2,Tue Jul 7 11:38:04 2015 UTC,"I really like that concept. Mainly the second balancing factor, the idea that the lies have to be connected to the actions the user wants the victim to commit.   I have this idea of slowly introducing this power by first making the players suffer very minor consequences. At worst one of them would  try to kiss the other or whatever, something seemingly harmless. Then, as the team decides that this opponent is just a comic relief pushover, hell will be unleashed and they will find themselves in big trouble.   This is really great, thank you very much! If you have any further ideas, do share them with me. I'd also love to hear any naming ideas you'd have. I'd like to personally suggest ""Mr Self Destruct"" from a Nine Inch Nails song (I think it fits nicely), but it's up to you."
StardustCrusaders,3cen93,cerulis,2,Tue Jul 7 12:10:05 2015 UTC,"Edit - Another one:  Name: Therapy  Power: D -> ???  Range: A (100 meters or so) -> ???  Speed: B -> ???  Durability: D -> ???  Potential: A -> E  It acts like a parasite, slowly 'eating' one's sanity. This stand will act as a copycat and mirror his last victim stand ability. The more it leeches the stronger the copy or 'image' will be, up to a maximum of 100% of the original one.  The ammount of time it needs to leech I will leave up to you to balance at your RPG pace but let me give you an example:  One day: Victim starts to feel dizzy, sees weird images while he sleeps. (25% or 33% stand power leeched)  Two Days: Dizziness increases, starts seeing weird, faint images in the day light (50% or 66% stand power leeched)  Three days: Nightmares. He clearly can see the enemy stand in action, inside his mind (may or may not remember such vision depending of one's mental resistance). (75% or 99% stand power leeched).  Four Days: Can't distinguish friend or foe, in worst case scenario: everything will be interpreted as a imminent threat. (Therapy equals the enemy stand capacities).  After the leech is complete (end of the day) the 'side effects' will slowly drift away (couple days, maybe more), leaving the person vulnerable. Therapy can return to it's onwer at any given moment (similar to Lovers) but if it is done before the 100% leech the victim will recover much faster.  If alone, the victim biggest hope is to find a way to deal with Therapy on the 3rd day while it still remembers the nightmare. Another possibility is to find the user himself by following the stand range rules."
StardustCrusaders,3cen93,MrMagmaneos,3,Tue Jul 7 12:17:46 2015 UTC,"Also, I would like to use this chance for you guys to critique some ideas I already had, here are two of them:    Digital Sea    Destructive Power: D  Speed: B  Range: A  Durability: C  Developmental Potential: C  The Stand (and it's user) interpret the world around them as computer code. They can freely alter its elements (think of it as ""hacking reality""), but require a lengthy windup period for every hack, because they have to de-compile whatever it is they want to interact with before any damage can be done. The weakness is the Stand's inability to distinguish objects of similar shape. The Stand user makes up for it by being very perceptive - he is capable of deducing what the object is from its speed, aerodynamics etc.    Big Blast Sonic    Destructive Power: C (A in Blast Sphere)  Range: D   Speed: C (A in Blast Sphere)  Durability: A (E in Blast Sphere)  Precision: D (B in Blast Sphere)  Developmental Potential: E   Big Blast Sonic can create what is called a ""Blast Sphere"" around himself and his opponents in the 10 meter radius. Inside the Blast Sphere, the Stand can multiply actions or reactions of every event that takes place. For example, if Big Blast Sonic was to punch an opponent, he could either multiply the action - causing a single punch to hit multiple times, or the reaction - making that single punch more damaging. Both effects cannot be attained at the same time and switching between them quickly, while possible, is very tiring for the Stand user. To everyone outside the 10 meter radius Blast Sphere, it appears as a transparent-dark red sphere, in which two people simply stand in place, gently twitching their bodies from time to time - signifying (and hinting to the outside) the motif of every action/reaction ""inside"" being a multiplication of what's going on ""outside""."
StardustCrusaders,3cen93,Mzmonyne,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:56:41 2015 UTC,"I liked both these stands.  Now for Big Blast Sonic: what would be it's weakness, simply raw power? And how could somebody from the outside interact of help a stuck ally?"
StardustCrusaders,3cen93,Starman-Deluxe,3,Tue Jul 7 17:05:19 2015 UTC,"I haven't thought of a name yet.  Power: B   Speed: C   Range: C   Durability: D   Precision: A   Developmental Potential: A   This stand can touch one object with it's right hand and one with its left and whatever happens to the one touched with the right, will also happen to the one touched with the left. This will last until the stand claps it's hands together. Also the user can choose whether or not to use something the stand touched for the power or not, so it can punch someone without using its power on them.   An example of this would be touching a box with the right hand and then a user with the left. The stand could then punch the box and the user would get hurt. Or if the user touches something that say will explode with the right, then anything they touch with the left may also explode. The user will have to be able to predict what will happen to objects in order to use this stand to it's full potential."

It can bring any moving object to a complete halt, or make a non-moving object shoot off in the desired direction. (the speed of this varies with weight: it can bring very small objects to the velocity of a bullet, but cannot increase a persons speed enough to cause any major injuries) This ability is unable to affect other stands, but can affect users.  This power can be used in a number of interesting ways. Random objects can be used as projectiles, the user can be sped up to quickly move a long distance, bullets fall harmlessly to the ground as soon as they touch Misery Business, punches appear to do nothing because the force behind them stops upon contact, enemies can be launched away, and as long as contact is maintained enemies can be completely frozen."

It has no abilities other than physical combat. The upper half is dormant when summoned. To activate the stand, the user must feed a sacrifice to the lower mouth. The more valuable the sacrifice, the more its stats will increase. Additionally, the stand has a set timer before becoming dormant again, the more valuable the sacrifice, the longer it has. However, the value of the sacrifice is determined by how much the user values it. For example, the last picture of their lost parents will make it stronger than Star Platinum, even though it is just a photo. If the user values money, things like jewels and gold would work. If the user is starving, a cheeseburger could work. sacrifices are limited to what the user can throw into the mouth, meaning the user can't just sacrifice a car.  I see the user getting desperate, and start sacrificing their own body parts to provide the stand with a massive boost, and may even end with throwing them-self into the mouth."
StardustCrusaders,3cen93,Ganmorg,2,Tue Jul 7 14:21:22 2015 UTC,"Here are some stands from a JoJo RPG I ran once.  『Ｓｕｐｅｒ Ｆｒｅａｋ』 Power: A Range: D Durability: B Precision: B Potential: D A stand that resembles an artillery platform, Super Freak is capable of raining down long-range bombardment upon foes, creating widespread devastation. It is weak at close range, and does not automatically protect its user.  『Ｍａｎｉａｃ』 Power: C Range: C Speed: A Durability: D Precision: A Potential: B  A stand that resembles a humanoid with long, pointed blades in place of its arms, legs, and head. It is always spinning on one of these blade-limbs and lashes out with its others to attack, contorting itself in an unpleasant manner. The stand itself has the power to localize gravity on itself, drawing foes closer to it where they will be sliced to pieces upon its blades.  『Ｐｒｉｖａｔｅ Ｅｙｅｓ』 Power: B Speed: B Range: D Durability: C Potential: A A stand that mimics the appearance of its user, Private Eyes has the power to make its user invisible while it assumes their appearance. The user can speak, see, and hear from Private Eyes, but its low range limits its ability to act as a scout. Acts somewhat independently from its user, and likes to ""team up"" with its user to fight foes.  『Ｅｕｒｙｔｈｍｉｃｓ』 Power: D Speed: D Range: D Durability: E Precision: A Potential: B Eurythmics is a stand that resembles a cross between an octopus and a human heart. It has the power to sync the rhythm of its ""heartbeats"" with other objects. It can influence the ticking of a clock, the tempo of someone's feet as they walk, and even induce cardiac arrest. However, it is a weak stand in most other respects, and can be easily defeated with a single punch.  『Ｒａｄｉｏ Ｇａｇａ』 Power: C Range: A Durability: D Precision: D Potential: B A remote stand that resembles two winged beings with empty audio jacks for faces. It can transform itself into radio waves and travel over long distances in the blink of an eye. The two work as a pair and can transmit sound from one to the other if an object is plugged in to their faces. A pair of headphones will allow the user to hear what the other being is hearing, while something like a loudspeaker and a microphone will allow them to project their voice to the other."

He can control his bones like muscles or appendages, such as bending his ribs or arms without breaking them, and he can 'hop' into people's bodies, eject their skeleton, and act as their skeleton as if their body was a suit of armor. Spooky Scary Skeletons acts somewhat independently, only wishing to further its user's goals, but will deliver commands. Although Spooky Scary Skeletons can take control of the person's movements, the person can still use anything that isn't part of their skeleton, excluding tendons and muscles (excluding heart). Spooky Scary Skeletons can hop from body to body if one would expire or die, and once it has exited it's victim's body, if they're still alive, they will be reduced to a blob-like state due to the absence of their skeleton and die shortly after. Spooky Scary Skeletons can also ravage the person's insides, such as :   using their jaw to bite off their tongue. Who needs help anyways? moving his ribs to devastate their lungs.

The only downside to this stand is it's speed. The knights are weighed down by their armor and have to be commanded and moved by their stand master as a unit.  The archers are very accurate and the swordsmen know exactly where to strike to do immense damage. The stand user is strong and thinks himself as a king.

Destructive Power: E  Speed: C  Range: A  Durability: D  Precision: B  Development Potential: A  Power: Manifests itself as several small crickets with the ability to distribute sound from one to another.

The stored force can later be transferred out of the stand to any object in which the stand's hands are in contact with.  For Example: A car is barreling towards the user and 70 mph. [Forces] reaches out and puts a hand on the car, the car immediately stops (assuming this is a bad guy, the occupants of the car would not stop and continue forward at 70 mph and probably die from breaking through the front window and crashing). Later, the user needs to get through a very thick wall; [Forces] reaches out and puts its hand against the wall. [Forces] then releases the absorbed force onto the wall and, just as if that car had ran into that wall at 70mph, the wall breaks.  You can mess around with it by making the force it exerts be a percentage lower than the original force or limit the stand by having it only be able to store one event of force (no matter how big...or little ;) ) within it."

StardustCrusaders,3cen93,AlmightyTritan,2,Wed Jul 8 14:49:13 2015 UTC,"I have a couple, and these are both animal stand users, as I feel that only human stand users could get a bit boring:  Stand Name: Hive Mind  Stand user: Sting (a bee)  Stand Ability: Mind control, Staphism  Power: C  Speed: B  Range: D  Durability: D  Precision: D  Potential: A  Description: A bee which has a piece of amber on its thorax, where the arrow shot it. When the stand is activated, a honey-like string will come down from the amber, and wrap it around the stinger.This will also keep the stinger attached to the bee, preventing death from the loss of it. When a victim is stung, Sting not only places the stand in the victim, but itself goes into the victim. Slowly flying up the blood stream, it also creates honey that will cause the victim to become ill. Once Sting reaches the brain, it stings the brain, gaining control of the victim, allowing it to force the victim to do its bidding. While it can make the victim move around and make regular attacks, Hive Mind can't make it do Any complex actions, such as spells or control a victim's stand. Once Sting is done with the victim, it will leave the way it came, then spread a pheromone that both attracts insects, as well as add more honey into the victims body, which the insects will feed off of, as well as the eventual corpse of the victim.   However, with high enough perception, a Stand user can find a bump, or a sweet scent that will give away Stings location. Then, the boys stream can either be frozen or heated up to make Sting escape. Then, it's a simple matter of defeating him. Also, once Sting enters the victim, you have 10 minutes to save him/her. More specifically, 5 minutes to get Sting before he reaches the brain, and 5 minutes to get him before he leaves the victim. Trying to get Sting while he's at the brain will cause brain damage and possibly kill the victim."

It's only existence is a whisper in the victims ear. It will only whisper demands to turn on your brethren. Hungry is a test by Like, measuring the loyalty of man to his fellow man. When it's first activated, or will test the victim, by constantly begging you to kill them, as well as giving him reasons to kill them. If the user agrees, he fails. If he persists and says no, he passes.  Whether or not the victim passes the test, it will then take control of the victims mind. The victim will then take turns asking his comrades a simple request:  ""Let me test your loyalty; I will strike you and miss. If you are loyal to me, you will not flinch, nor dodge,  nor block, nor attack me.""  If the friend refuses the request, they have failed. If they flinch, dodge, block, or attack the victim, they failed.  If they stay perfectly still, even if at fault the strike hits them, they pass. If all pass, Like will appear, a battle-battered, yet beautiful white wolf,  nod,  and gift them fresh spoils from a hunt. If any one if them fail, Like will appear, baring his fangs, and bring his pack, as many as those that failed the test, and make them attack the failiures. They can be beaten, as well as Like, but will it be a true victory?   Hungry has two weaknesses.    The first one involves a party member with high enough charisma. If someone can persuade the victim out of their mind control, Hunger will leave.   The second one involves inventory. If you have an amount of food equivalent of a whole adult buck and present it to the victim, Like will appear, then leave with the food."

The stand must touch the object, which it can do in a short radius. Special rules about this power: It can not duplicate stand users, or people aware of stands in general. One Time must take all living things by surprise in order to duplicate them. When touched, the user can refrain from duplicating it until it becomes useful. The user can also duplicate it as many times as they want, until they touch another object with it.  *Weakness: This stand doesn't have a weakness, but it can be defeated with either pure violence, or by destroying every duplication made in the surrounding (let's say... 5m,) area.

StardustCrusaders,3ccxea,WhompWump,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:07:12 2015 UTC,I'll go back to it when the translations are done.
StardustCrusaders,3ccxea,razorbeamz,2,Tue Jul 7 16:12:21 2015 UTC,"I don't get that. I have a fully translated version on my computer and I've read all through part 5 no problem. Unless I'm missing something, I don't see a problem with that translation"
StardustCrusaders,3ccxea,levilee207,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:20:23 2015 UTC,People who have read the Japanese/Italian versions say that the current English translation leaves out a lot of the characterization. I remember someone saying that Abbacchio is actually more of a joker.
StardustCrusaders,3ccxea,davesoon,5,Thu Jul 9 00:13:41 2015 UTC,"I've actually got one drafted up! It still needs work and a bit more input, so I haven't posted it here yet (and I got kind of distracted reading the manga).  But yes, it will hopefully cut back on easily answered/repetitive questions, so please look forward to it!  Some of the other items covered include ""Why is this sub called /r/StardustCrusaders and not something else?"", ""What is Duwang and where can I read it?"", and ""Where should I start reading the manga/where should I start watching the anime?"".  I'd love to hear more suggestions though!"

StardustCrusaders,3ccxea,redheaded_robot,2,Tue Jul 7 00:10:23 2015 UTC,"Good idea! I have little experience buying from English-speaking websites, have any recommendations?"
StardustCrusaders,3ccxea,Fleerate,2,Tue Jul 7 00:12:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about general merch, but for translated manga, I would say Barnes and Noble is pretty good to buy from.  btw, sorry for the unrelated question, but what's the latest on the banner contest?"
StardustCrusaders,3ccxea,Fleerate,2,Tue Jul 7 00:39:34 2015 UTC,I'm working on the thread simultaneously while typing up the FAQ ^^ Give me a few minutes to post it!
StardustCrusaders,3ccxea,redheaded_robot,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:42:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not a US resident, so I can't help you with that :(  Oh, depending on where the FAQ will be posted you might want to add the wallpaper thread to it (I'm updating it right now)."
StardustCrusaders,3ccxea,_meppz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:57:39 2015 UTC,"No worries, we'll get it all sorted out, one way or another!  Sure thing, I'll try and add some more fanart wallpapers too (maybe some less silly ones); most of the other walls I have are all from here originally, and I think they've been posted in that thread already."
StardustCrusaders,3ccxea,redheaded_robot,2,Tue Jul 7 01:01:30 2015 UTC,"It might also be prudent to update the spoiler policy with what does and does not need to be spoiled (past the most recent episode?)  Also don't worry about it. If there's a good reason to be distracted, it's the manga."
StardustCrusaders,3ccxea,redheaded_robot,3,Mon Jul 6 23:38:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed! I was kind of thinking ""anything past the current chapter discussion"" (at least until they announce a Part Four anime - they will!).  We should have a community-wide discussion and/or poll to ascertain what is the appropriate course for spoiler tagging now, as previously it's been character deaths, lineage, upcoming fights, etc.; we've had a lot more subscribers since we initially laid the spoiler rules down, so a refresher is a good idea!"
StardustCrusaders,3ccxea,_meppz,2,Mon Jul 6 23:46:51 2015 UTC,"Some subs have filters based on thread flairs, it could be a nice addition to the sub. (At least one to hide manga spoilers, and maybe some others to look for content about a specific part ?)"
StardustCrusaders,3ccxea,Dragoryu3000,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:11:29 2015 UTC,The 'Sort by Part' tab in the sidebar does just that! We're working on a more detailed spoiler sorting system as well.

Before I watched/read JoJo, I liked slender guys with long hair - muscles were definitely not my thing, and short hair was completely out of the question. But then, it was like this amazing transformation occurred as I progressed through the series, and seeing this 195cm, 105kg English gentleman with thick short hair that you just want to run your fingers through, hnnngggg, I became a different person with totally different attractions.   Jotaro would be a close second, he's still rocking that 195cm height and he's got a decent amount of muscles. Plus, the whole delinquent thing and his standoffish nature is pretty hot.  Giorno is definitely a cutie though~"

Then it's Joseph, because his personality is sexier than Jonathans. That's all really.  Then it's Josuke because he's got a well built upper body and he's fab af  Then it's Jotaro because he's well built but not as fab as the Josuke with the Mostuke  Then it's Giorno, because unlike Johnny most of the time he's not an asshole. I'm sure when he's an adult his muscles will build in. One day...  Then Johnny, the ragdoll cat of the JoJos. You just want to pick him up and throw him around your shoulders and wear him as a fancy scarf, he looks like a teddy bear. Even though he's actually a bit of a shit.

StardustCrusaders,3c83y1,SuperBattleFranky37,9,Sun Jul 5 23:21:26 2015 UTC,Rohan just hates Josuke. He's chummy with everyone else.
StardustCrusaders,3c83y1,ACoolSkeleton,36,Mon Jul 6 00:17:06 2015 UTC,He punched a third grader
StardustCrusaders,3c83y1,SuperBattleFranky37,15,Mon Jul 6 02:39:59 2015 UTC,Pretty mild all things considered.
StardustCrusaders,3c83y1,VictoryRaptor,10,Mon Jul 6 02:43:43 2015 UTC,"That kid had it coming, though. What with the spoiler"
StardustCrusaders,3c83y1,ACoolSkeleton,7,Mon Jul 6 06:33:34 2015 UTC,"Come on, it was one time"
StardustCrusaders,3c83y1,arittz,10,Mon Jul 6 06:52:19 2015 UTC,"hasn't he been shown to be kind of an asshole with everyone else too though? he just hates josuke the most, and koichi the least"
StardustCrusaders,3c83y1,AxionAtelier,5,Mon Jul 6 00:48:47 2015 UTC,OH YEAH MR. JOSTER (caution loud)
StardustCrusaders,3c83y1,rockman_welost,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:51:37 2015 UTC,what the fuck was that
StardustCrusaders,3c83y1,xmunstaaa,3,Tue Jul 7 16:18:36 2015 UTC,Now I'm trying to make connections with JoJo and Spongebob....Fatty kind of reminds me of Mr.Krabs. Jotaro's wife should be Krabs daughter Pearl ahaha.
StardustCrusaders,3c8vhu,PNBJND2,11,Mon Jul 6 00:06:42 2015 UTC,Yessssssssss. I've been waiting for a bass cover of this since I first heard it. Good stuff.
StardustCrusaders,3c8vhu,PiGreat,11,Mon Jul 6 00:13:44 2015 UTC,Is that a man?
StardustCrusaders,3c8vhu,Kaalcite,10,Mon Jul 6 01:22:00 2015 UTC,Yes.
StardustCrusaders,3c8vhu,xeniera,20,Mon Jul 6 01:25:59 2015 UTC,Hot.
StardustCrusaders,3c8vhu,Kaalcite,10,Mon Jul 6 01:27:06 2015 UTC,And I was going to post my guitar cover of Sono Chi no Kioku.  Now I'd just look like a copycat.  Granted I lack the sex appeal of this video.  Fun watch.
StardustCrusaders,3c8vhu,xeniera,6,Mon Jul 6 01:20:47 2015 UTC,"Do it anyways, and toss me some tabs or something if you have 'em. I want to learn some of it. :O"
StardustCrusaders,3c8vhu,Monosentence,2,Mon Jul 6 02:58:54 2015 UTC,"It has been posted!  I learned it by ear and don't have tabs readily available, but I'm sure I could put together something basic over the next few days, if you'd like."
StardustCrusaders,3c8vhu,xeniera,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:07:26 2015 UTC,"I'd love it mayne, good deal! Imma checkitout"
StardustCrusaders,3c8vhu,Monosentence,9,Mon Jul 6 04:48:34 2015 UTC,He has some really nice legs
StardustCrusaders,3c8vhu,RATDandy,5,Mon Jul 6 03:34:57 2015 UTC,"I saw a few of his band cover and gotta say, that's very brave of him when most musicians choose to cover their face/identity while he is perfectly fine to demonstrate his entertainment value.  Would love to know more about him, is he actually a professional? Or online celebrity ?"
StardustCrusaders,3c8vhu,GonTheDinosaur,5,Mon Jul 6 10:02:32 2015 UTC,HJFREAKS yeeeees. I found him by searching for senbon Sakura covers. He is very talented. If you enjoyed this you will love his other stuff.
StardustCrusaders,3c8y92,X-JIDE,7,Mon Jul 6 00:31:39 2015 UTC,"I'm am Dio!   Its shit   Just kidding though, great compilation"
