rally,3cu828,seacucumber3000,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:52:56 2015 UTC,I'm glad I wasn't the only one who saw the S1 Quattro in that render.
rally,3cu828,Jay911,15,Sat Jul 11 19:33:18 2015 UTC,"Full details from the FIA meetings:    Powered increased to 380hp 36mm maximum diameter for the turbo restrictor Maximum 2.5b absolute turbo pressure Free zone defined around the body shell of the production car to create a maximum WRC car width of 1875mm and greater overhang front and rear Greater freedom on the lateral parts of the front bumper, with potential for additional aero devices ahead of the front wheels. Openings may also be cut-out on the fender surface Bigger and more visible fixed rear wing   The overall weight of the car will be reduced by 25kg, there will be a return to an electronically-controlled centre differential and the overall homologated length of the car must be greater than or equal to 3.9 metres."
rally,3cu828,sirnicolai,17,Fri Jul 10 20:39:22 2015 UTC,"What the hell is with the FIA and their constant cost cutting and then cost increasing ?  Weve been down this road before, cars got incredibly complex and costs sky rocketed, manufacturers dropped out, rules were changed, simpler and cheaper cars were reintroduced, costs were cut, slowly manufacturers started coming back. And just as the series looks its most stable in years, with new manufacturers coming onboard, they increase the complexity which will drive up costs again.  So now we are going back to full WRC spec cars like in the early 2000's with electronic centre diffs and paddle gear changes and lots of fancy aero parts that are going to get smashed up. How long until manufacturers start dropping out again ? And then how long until the FIA dictate the cars are too complex and drop them back to 1 litre 4 cylinders with simple aero and manual gear changes ?"
rally,3cu828,NachoManSandyRavage,9,Fri Jul 10 23:47:45 2015 UTC,I agree. at this point they should keep the class as is and bring back Group B. Saftey equipment is now up to par for the speeds but they should make the limit something like 400 horsepower with the same old homologation rules to keep the manufacturers from going too crazy and doing something like a rally spec Veyron.
rally,3cu828,Lefthandedsock,7,Sat Jul 11 01:57:29 2015 UTC,a rally spec Veyron.   Please stop.  I can only get so hard.
rally,3cu828,Buck-O,10,Sat Jul 11 11:40:15 2015 UTC,"To be honest, this whole rules change is just a big FIA pander to PSA, and little else.  Citroen/PSA has been allowed to dictate the rules directions for the last several years. When the S2000 regs came out, and VW brought their A-game to get a car that worked right, Citroens competitiveness dropped out, losing Loeb probably didn't help either. Now after their long run of victories, suddenly playing second fiddle, they start to whine like a highschool girl, talking about how they are going to leave the WRC for good.  And then just a couple weeks later, the new 2017 WRC reg proposals come out, and suddenly, they are talking about moving to the WTCC engine spec, and an aero package that sounds suspiciously like a WTCC aero package. I mean, read their aero package direction, and then look at this picture, and tell me its not the same concept? http://i.wheelsage.org/pictures/c/citroen/c-elysee_wtcc/citroen_c-elysee_wtcc_19.jpeg  So now we have WTCC rally cars, effectively. And who won the WTCC last year under the new regulations? Citroen, winning 13 of 15 race meetings. And they are on form to do the same this year. Out of the 7 rounds, and 14 races run so far, Citroens have won 12 of them. Its caused quite a stir among the other WTCC teams, as many feel that Citroen has been skirting the regulations a bit. Talking about how they are making way too much power, and pulling cars on the straight, even with their weight penalty, and even with a tow, others are getting dropped. Which was no where more evident than at the Nurburgring race. Likewise other drivers have said, quite literally...""Citroen have brought a rally cross car out here to bang and shovel anyone out of the way."" And quite literally, if you bang fenders with one of the Citroens, you are bound to lose.  So when these new regs come out, Citroen will already have a solid engine program. Already have a solid aero direction, and will likely start testing WRC parts on the WTCC car...oh, and Loeb can run the development feedback on it, how convenient.  Quite frankly I think this has more to do with Jean Todt giving PSA a pat on the back, and less to do with improving the show, or cost cutting, or whatever else they try to use as an excuse. French team, French governed series, that happened to have a French President, who worked for 10+ years for the parent company of said French team, yeah, no potential collusion or back door deals there."
rally,3cu828,k_of_ni,6,Sat Jul 11 05:49:29 2015 UTC,"Citroën's main problem isn't the engine nor the aero package, but drivers and maybe budget. Some interesting observations, nonetheless, I for one believe that politics are strongly involved in all major motor sport series, sadly even WRC."
rally,3cu828,Buck-O,2,Sat Jul 11 11:40:25 2015 UTC,"While I agree that isn't their problem now. They will be coming into new rules with a SUBSTANTIAL advantage. Because they have, arguably, the strongest engine package in the WTCC, and no other current rally teams have any involvement with those regulations. It gives them a significant advantage. Especially when you compare that to someone like Toyota, who is currently evaluating whether they even continue with their current Yaris program, and evolve it to the new regs, or start from scratch. Citroen already has the two biggest parts of a new program, well sorted out. They will be at a distinct advantage to everyone else."
rally,3cu828,ccx806,3,Sat Jul 11 20:47:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be at all surprised if Citroen renege on their previous statement of halting involvment in one of the series that year. Hell, I can completely see Loeb returning to their rally program full time"
rally,3cu828,k_of_ni,2,Sun Jul 12 00:27:26 2015 UTC,"If only they would do something about their ""thoughts"" and ""announcements"" sounding like threats and ultimatums, it's not constructive, but again, let's not forget Volkswagen's whining over the infamous shootout powerstage ""idea"" not long ago."
rally,3cu828,Buck-O,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:02:04 2015 UTC,"Totally can see Loeb coming back. And with the WTCC regs the way they are, I can see Citroen doubling down on using the WTCC cars for a strictly development platform.  Or, maybe this was their plan all along?"
rally,3cu828,ccx806,2,Sun Jul 12 04:04:36 2015 UTC,"With the way politics work, nothing is certain. All we do know is that the new rules are a little too ideal for Citroen to simply be a conincidence"
rally,3cu828,Buck-O,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:03:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, WAY to coincidental to be purely happenstance, and just a natural progression of the rules."
rally,3cu828,k_of_ni,2,Sun Jul 12 19:05:21 2015 UTC,"Perhaps they will and perhaps that's not such a bad thing. I don't see Volkswagen and/or Toyota being stuck behind for too long. You're definitely right about their WTCC programme giving them more knowledge and ready-made tech to use sooner than others, but I cannot help myself thinking that Citroën probably would not be in the position it is today if it had drivers capable of consistent podium finishes. Volkswagen is practically giving stuff away with Latvala's crashes, yet Citroën is not always there to make the best of it."
rally,3cu828,Buck-O,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:06:21 2015 UTC,"Your not wrong about why Citroen is where it is. Their driver development leaves much to be desired. And I honestly can't understand why teams keep putting money into Latvala. He was prone to bone headed mistakes in his first years with Ford, and nothing changed. He should have been swapped out a lng time ago, IMHO. But, u think its just a case of when VW needed a driver, anyone else who was anyone else was in the IRC, and no one wanted to race Loeb. So you take what's left...Latvala. He's not Colin where its either win, or crash trying flat out. He just makes dumb mistakes, and usually off the podium when he doesn't.  Anyway, I dont imagine VW, Toyota, or Hyundai, will rest on their laurels, but being ahead of the curve sure does help. Just look at F1, Mercedes got it right, developed well before they put it on track, and help with regulations. In comes Honda and...yeah."
rally,3cu828,k_of_ni,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:12:59 2015 UTC,"Ah, but Honda is new to the game and the F1 engine development, or should I call that thing a power unit, actually?  In WRC I don't suppose engines will be so different between now and 2017., who knows how much of that extra power comes just from the increased turbo flow.  IMO, Citroën's biggest step would be getting a driver capable of fighting Ogier and Volkswagen, and that would have to be someone who is very familiar with the car, very involved and also very very consistent. Any other advantage, from rules and such, would just evaporate after few silly crashes and missed opportunities.  Good points about Latvala. Very similar to Meeke. When planets align, they're unstoppable, but in the meantime Ogier has won two titles and he's after many more."
rally,3cu828,Buck-O,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:11:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it's fair to call it a power unit, its way more than just an ICE.  Generally, no, not much will change fundamentally with the engine layout. I would imagine there is an awful lot in common with the C'Elyse(sp) and the C3 engines. That said, however, getting more CFM of air, along with more boost can change a lot of engine parameters all to improve efficiency, and make the most of it. Improvements to the intake, combustion chamber, etc.   For sure they will need a good driver, but having an assured performance advantage is a great way to bag one."
rally,3cu828,ccx806,2,Sun Jul 12 23:49:06 2015 UTC,"You make some very good points, especially regarding the closeness of the aero regs between WRC 2017 and WTCC (something I didn't notice until you brought it up).   Do you think these new regulations would have been brought forward had Citroen faired better against VW over the last 2 seasons? (Being reasonably competitive vs. getting pooped on)"
rally,3cu828,k_of_ni,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:24:30 2015 UTC,"When VW drivers crash, and they do that (except Ogier), Citroën should definitely be there to jump in and take the points and positions, yet they often are not because their drivers are either struggling or crashing. Some say it's because they must push extra hard to make up for the car not being as competitive as Polo, but I'm not sure that's the only reason. Meeke has massive speed in him but he is not there in his head, so to speak. Perhaps he is close to sorting out his bugs, but season is only so long."
rally,3cu828,Buck-O,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:09:48 2015 UTC,"I have no doubt that the regulations would have been changed, just to further the sport such as it always does. But I don't know that they would be so closely related to the WTCC regulations, or played so well into Citroens favor, had they not been in the position they are currently, and with the threats of leaving like they have been."
rally,3cu828,austex_mike,9,Sun Jul 12 02:31:00 2015 UTC,"I am most interested in any changes that bring back Subaru, Ford and possibly Mitsubishi. I would kill to see a WRX, Evo and Ford Focus fighting it out in WRC events again. Until then, these changes just kind of make me wish things were different."
rally,3cu828,black_pepper,6,Sat Jul 11 06:12:51 2015 UTC,Mitsubishi killed the Evolution. I think they are mulling over bringing the name back for a mini van or some nonsense. The people in charge have no aspirations for anything remotely exciting.
rally,3cu828,cantpee,8,Sat Jul 11 13:06:50 2015 UTC,Still spec transmission? Subaru is never going back to top class rally.
rally,3cu828,TheRealIntern,5,Fri Jul 10 23:21:12 2015 UTC,"So, I'm a bit confused. I thought that Subaru couldn't compete because of the engine limitations. Are there transmission limitations that are stopping them as well?  Also, why doesn't the FIA simply limit the power of the cars to the WHP/FT LB instead of the size?"
rally,3cu828,cantpee,5,Sat Jul 11 00:00:06 2015 UTC,"When S2000 regulations were introduced, it required the use of a spec gearbox manufactured by Sadev, which was built for a transversely mounted motor. Prior to leaving WRC, they had pressure from Prodrive to ditch the boxer motors for a transverse four, but Subaru was relying heavily on boxer motors and awd for their marketing, so were unwilling to change their motors. The other regulation changes didn't seem like a huge deal (no electronic differentials, no center differential, 1600cc turbo motors, no minimum length, etc.) , but the transmission issue could be considered the final nail in the coffin for Subaru and WRC, some other big ones including chronic reliability issues, lack of competitiveness, and the 2008 economic downturn that really hurt a small manufacturer like Subaru."
rally,3cu828,Buck-O,5,Sat Jul 11 02:59:28 2015 UTC,"Beyond that, Subaru doesn't have a car that can compete in the S2000 class on size alone.  Now, true, they do have the BR-Z, but that runs into the same engine issue location issue, and AWD packaging would be difficult.  Likewise, they also have the Trezia, which is in fact an i4, however, its also a Toyota, much in the same way the GT-86 carries the heart of a Subaru. To further complicate the problem, the Trezia shares the Yaris platform, which is exactly the same platform that Toyota will be using for their WRC return, and I hardly see Toyota being OK with Subaru using their platform to go rallying, despite their recent technology sharing.  And all of the Impreza models are simply too big to be worth trying to comply with S2000 specs anyway."
rally,3cu828,Calamity_Jesus,3,Sat Jul 11 05:27:40 2015 UTC,"Also, why doesn't the FIA simply limit the power of the cars to the WHP/FT LB instead of the size?   Because you can't police whp/ft-lb.  A team could simply have a method of turning up the boost that's buried within the ECM.  For instance, Ford could set it up so that their codrivers would only need to flip a few seemingly random switches within, say, 5 seconds to access a high boost mode until the car is restarted.  The FIA would have to test every car on the dyno at every event and those secret high boost modes wouldn't even show up in testing.  A standardized restrictor plate on the turbo inlet of a standardized turbo will limit HP the same for everyone.  The limit is how much air can flow from ambient air pressure into something approaching a total vacuum inside the turbo compressor's inlet.  No software can alter it and it can be checked for compliance by any official with a simple template or micrometer."
rally,3cu828,CyberianSun,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:03:36 2015 UTC,damn toyota for forcing standardized turbos.
rally,3cu828,DragonDragon_,2,Sun Jul 12 13:04:35 2015 UTC,"Iam guessing its because Subaru doesn't make, or develop straight-4 motors, and transverse-gearboxes?  And why they just don't set a HP limit, its properly because of the mystique that some manufacturers can do little thing to get the extra 2HP, and things like that. There is also more to engine power then top HP/FT-LB."

rally,3bzuog,kstyler,4,Sun Jul 5 18:31:41 2015 UTC,"Did it seem like Ogier was on a PR drive this weekend to anyone else?  First, the wave from the moving car in the SS on Thursday and then signing that kids picture in his car right before leaving the maintenance bay?  The way that WRC filmed the portion with the kid, it came across as possibly staged and/or oddly emphasized.  All of it makes me wonder if he isn't trying to rebuild his PR from some of the previous rallies.  Either way, I have to give him credit and respect where it is due.  He definitely dominates for a reason (I tell my wife that I think he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for driving ability)."
rally,3bzuog,dwkGravey,2,Mon Jul 6 13:56:33 2015 UTC,"The last-second autograph signing definitely felt staged or forced, and it should take a lot more than that to turn around those critical of Ogier.  I don't have a problem with Ogier winning when he earns it, even if I'd like to see more drivers up front (I'm a Hamilton fan too, but I was sure pulling for Williams last weekend)—but that's up to the other drivers and teams. My problem is Ogier's attitude and sportsmanship: he's cocky when he's winning (fine), and petulant when he's not—irritatingly petulant, and not just moaning about the road order, but any time he's not in front.  Contrast Ogier with Latvala. No matter how bad things go, and they've been going pretty badly for JM, when Latvala pulls up to stage end—like SS19—he always takes the time to talk: what happened, what went wrong, what he thinks. To me that shows maturity, and respect, for the fans and for the show. The only time I can think of that JM didn't talk, he wasn't sulking, he was crying (full disclosure: I only started watching WRC in 2013).  To compare Ogier with Hamilton again, Ogier has the skill but he still has a lot more growing up to do. That's where Latvala far outpaces him."

I'm also happy that Paddon is hanging around in 5th.  So far he is following up pretty well after Rally Italia.  And Meeke just can't catch a break...."

I know he was having brake issues but why were his tires getting eaten up? At the end, what a surprise result for him. Meeke's save on Day 2 from the flip, man, he got lucky. It was weird seeing Abbring from ERC running a WRC event (not in a bad way, just odd seeing him there!) It seems like Mikkelsen has been improving suddenly over the last couple events. Does Jost Capito look really ragged after the last couple rallies or is it me? /u/kstyler mentioned it, but I also agree it seemed really odd showing Ogier signing that photo for the kid.

During that time they did nothing to groom a successor or develop a team of more than one. It's entirely conceivable that Ogier would still be there had they not constantly pushed him aside in favour of Loeb for nearly his entire tenure."

rally,3bvbzq,ZchmeKko,2,Thu Jul 2 20:14:42 2015 UTC,Pretty much. He made that car while most of the other drives struggled with it (one exception being Richard Burns). Mitsubishi's performance dropped off dramatically after Makinen left at the end of 2001  They sort of just faded away after that
rally,3bvbzq,ccx806,3,Sat Jul 4 01:26:37 2015 UTC,"Well they did groom Ogier,  but they screwed up holding him back and he went elsewhere to win championships."
rally,3bvbzq,HerpDerpenberg,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:20:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed. IIRC, the conflict between Loeb and Ogier came to a head in 2011. Loeb (i think) threatened to join VW if Ogier was not dealt with (pretty much saying ""it's me or him'). Citroen responded by releasing Ogier from his contract (he was signed for 3 years, 2011-2013)"
rally,3bvbzq,ccx806,2,Mon Jul 6 23:57:17 2015 UTC,I feel it's tough with WRC and VW have the car and the driver (Ogier) that it is hard for anyone to compete.  Thierry Newville seemed as a hopeful contender but went to Hyundai. Meeke at least pulled a non VW win this year. JML has the speed but lacks the consistency.   I would have loved to see Loeb and Ogier go at it with Citroën vs VW and Ford/Hyundai to mix it in.
rally,3bvbzq,HerpDerpenberg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:10:37 2015 UTC,"It's strange. By 2011-2012, I couldn't wait for Loeb to retire and was constantly on the lookout for any news related to his departure. 3 years later, I wish he would return, if for no other reason than to give Ogier a run for his money.  Ultimately, I think Neuville's decision to go to Hyundai was a prudent one, since having the backing of a factory team provides more stability than a privateer outfit like M-Sport"
rally,3bvbzq,ccx806,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:49:05 2015 UTC,"since having the backing of a factory team provides more stability than a privateer outfit like M-Sport   Kris Meeke probably was thinking along those same lines, 'till MINI pulled out after half a season. Still, surely Citroen would be a safe bet. Oh wait...  I think Neuville would have done way better over the past two years if he'd stayed with M-Sport. And he would have been their #1 driver after Mikko retired."
rally,3bvbzq,Buck-O,3,Tue Jul 7 08:08:38 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately manufacturers are allowed, all too often in the FIA, to steer the rules far more than they should be allowed. Lancia did it in the early days of Group-A, and then Toyota did it for a while, until Mistubishi started to do it through the 90's bookended by Subarus, and then Subaru did it with the WRCar spec through the late 90's (no thanks to David Richards), and then when PSA started to with Peugeot, and then with Citroen, they were left to do it for years, unlike the 3-4 every other manufacturer was given (some might say that being a French car company with a French driver in a French governed series who is overseen by a Frenchman who used to work for their French parent company might have played some significant part in this). And now VW is steering the S2000 rules, and Citroen doesn't want to play anymore.  Sadly the exact same thing that was happening in the WRC is now happening in the WTCC, with Citroen heavily steering the rules and regulatory changes, and making a car that is always competitive within them. Its pretty disgusting really. And honestly kills the racing.  As much as I hate to say it, I think Citroen just needs to leave motorsport for a while, and PSA should let Peugeot come back to the forfront of world motorsport, instead of playing second fiddle in the S1600, and S2000 class cars."

The biggest thing you want to avoid with hooning on those nice dirt roads is injury, to others or yourself. A lot of the better dirt roads (in Washington at least) are on federal land, or places where there might be hikers or cyclists. Worse still they're usually flanked by very steep drop offs. Or huge trees. Or boulders.   So you kind of have to look at it and say is the fun I'm about to have here worth a big ticket, jail time, someone getting hurt or dying? How about if you total your car? Probably not.   Also, what happens when you debead a tire? Or get two flats? Or punch a hole in your oil pan and you're 80 miles from civilization or cell service?  At the end of the day the safest, least illegal way to have that kind of fun is rally cross or amateur stage rally.   If you're in New Hampshire (iirc) or Washington state try a rally school; either dirt fish (Seattle) or team oneil (New Hampshire). They're a blast, you're in a controlled environment with a highly trained teacher and best of all its not your car you're flogging.   I dunno, food for thought."

rally,3bq5ne,bacon8,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:58:34 2015 UTC,RBR? And as far as I'm aware a lot of the events were Gymkhana-focused.
rally,3bq5ne,PerfectHair,2,Wed Jul 1 20:27:34 2015 UTC,"RBR = Richard Burns Rally. Considered by many to be the definite rally simulator game. Realistic physics and damage modeling. Stages are varying, they are narrow and uneven which is something most rally games don't capture well, some quite long stages too. The game is 10 years old so it feels very dated, but there is a serious modding community which has made tons of mods like new real-world stages and of course just about any competitive rally car you could think of. When I played it myself I used the RSRBR mod, which works like a platform for other mods (car and stage packs). Also visual mods and the voices of real-life co-drivers.  Of course the mods can only do so much, and you notice it's an old game. Rally sim fans have been waiting for a modern successor, and some say that Dirt: Rally might actually be it. I haven't played it myself but from the clips I've seen, it looks promising.  Yes, there were Gymkhana events, but it was still said the relative amount of rally was higher in DiRT 3 than previous games, as previous games had more of the other modes (rallycross, trailblazer, rally raid and land rush). DiRT 3 had those too, but not as much as rally I think. The other game modes were OK, but it was because of the rally mode that I bought the game.  I found the trailblazer mode kind of redundant though. Stages were the same as in the rally mode, but with more powerful cars and no co-driver. You still had to push just as hard to win as in the rally mode, so you had to rely on the little map in the middle of the screen instead of a co-driver. A map which also was present in the rally mode where you actually had a co-driver, why do they show us a map then? And if I remember correctly, the map couldn't even be turned off."

rally,3bcjm8,Lotete,2,Sat Jun 27 22:46:32 2015 UTC,That is the quietest rally car I've ever heard.
rally,3babfc,wilof,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:51:58 2015 UTC,I last went in 2003. Although I didn't go camping I stayed in a small converted barn bunkhouse in Ystradfellte which was quite cheap. Not sure if the route goes near there this year.  The weekend is worth it if youre really into rallying and want to get a fair few stages in with different view types and also the service park. However if you are not a full on rallying buff then a couple of days should do it.  Also note that it doesn't take long for all the WRC level drivers to pass you on the stage and you are then watching the rest of the field. For me it was always worth waiting for any classics to come through. The RWD cars are the best to watch.

rally,3babfc,BigHowski,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:46:17 2015 UTC,"Camping ..... in November ..... in Wales?  Are you soft in the head?  Book a B&B close to the action, you will need some space to dry your wet gear between the days .... which sort of answers your other question: go for the weekend.  Try and take the following day out of it too do you can enjoy the atmosphere, rally fans in the Ireland and the UK like to party pretty hard.  Nothing heats you up after a day on the stages than a night on the beer.  If you want some fun find some Irish fans .... they tend to congregate together and are just there for the fun.  This was 'Irish corner' on last years Rally GB.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvppWKAO22A"

If you're planning on this, try AirBnB as well. All the hotels and B&Bs I looked at a  few months ago were either booked up pretty good or really expensive per night. IDK what it is looking like now. I got lucky and found a nice cottage in Corris close to the Dyfi Stage for relatively cheap."
rally,3babfc,Weiner_McDingle,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:33:16 2015 UTC,Went two years ago and with the recent move to the north car parks get full very quickly! Would recommend arriving early and walking through the stages to a good spot. Can guarantee you'll enjoy it the speed is immense. Wouldn't rely on camping in a tent unless you can guarantee the weather won't be freezing cold. Can snow at that time of year in Britain!
rally,3b6rhu,draws_your_car,3,Fri Jun 26 12:45:04 2015 UTC,Awesome works as always!  Have you done any more like this? I mean the more famous motorsport cars.
rally,3b6rhu,Nomnom_downvotes,2,Fri Jun 26 20:19:23 2015 UTC,Thanks!  Here's Mansell's Williams FW11  Senna's McLaren MP4/4  And the Ford Sierra Cosworths of Dick Johnson and John Bowe

rally,3b6nmi,y4m4,5,Fri Jun 26 12:05:36 2015 UTC,"Subaru, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Mitsubishi. Oh, a Mk2 Golf. And Ford Focus. What? A Ford Ranger? Ha! Props for even attempting what must have been scary as hell in a shed like that.       ""Hey Cleetus, let's go teach them pussies what a real off-roader is!"""
rally,3b6nmi,scramtek,3,Fri Jun 26 15:14:48 2015 UTC,That ranger was a ton of fun to watch.  He was moving pretty good too.
rally,3b6nmi,gpain83,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:02:45 2015 UTC,I had more of a giggle at the Dodge Neon. Never would have expected that at a rally :p
rally,3b6nmi,waluigithewalrus,2,Fri Jun 26 18:03:17 2015 UTC,There were a few Dodge sponsored SRT-4 rally cars that were very active in the Rally America series a few years ago. Doug Shepard won a few championships in his. They were great FWD rally cars.
rally,3b6nmi,barre_chord_reality,2,Fri Jun 26 18:44:01 2015 UTC,"The SRT Neon is a great entry to any clubman Motorsport. Cheap, light, relatively powerful and plentiful replacement parts available at every parts shop in the U.S. It has no pedigree but is a perfect candidate for cheap racing."
rally,3b6nmi,scramtek,-1,Fri Jun 26 19:16:39 2015 UTC,"Well, if a Neon can do well at rally, then I think I can do well with my PT Cruiser... :P"
rally,3b6nmi,waluigithewalrus,3,Fri Jun 26 19:44:38 2015 UTC,"Well, I'd definitely applaud your bravery. And you'd certainly provide some light relief for spectators. But, at no point would I recommend a PT Cruiser for any task. Even driving to the corner shop and back.      Out of interest, how do you reconcile your love of Rallying with the ownership of the worst vehicle Chrysler has ever produced? :)         Also, do you even centre-of-gravity bro?"
rally,3b6nmi,scramtek,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:24:54 2015 UTC,The Datsun was my favorite (240z?). I'd love to get one of those and turn it into a rally car.

rally,3ax4q4,jonny-five,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:19:01 2015 UTC,"Subaru pulled out in 2008, though there are still Subarus in WRC2. Fords are run as part of the M-Sport team, with the official Ford branded team withdrawing in 2012.   Also Peugeots are only found in the WRC2 and WRC3 divisions."
