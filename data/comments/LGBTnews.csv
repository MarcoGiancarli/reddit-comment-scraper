There is no choice at all in it.  I have also known people who can choose to engage in sex with either gender, but who can only fall in love with one gender.  And I have known a few genuine bisexuals who find individuals attractive from both, with and without romantics.  Sex is definitely a spectrum, but the fact that it is a spectrum does not mean that it is fluid for all people.  It is fluid for some people.  Others are born with very narrow bandwidth of expression."

Many gay rights advocates hold that whether being gay is a choice is irrelevant to the question of whether gays should have full human rights -- and Walker agrees.  Except his view is that, in either case, discrimination and false portrayal of gay people as a threat to children are justified.  After all, he's a ""values"" candidate.

Recognizing same-sex marriage does not advance this interest because same-sex unions do not result in pregnancy.”   Pretzel logic at its finest.

LGBTnews,3cek66,InconsideratePrick,5,Tue Jul 7 11:09:34 2015 UTC,"My priest back in college was an honest man.  He always said that in the original languages the relationship between David and Jonathon was unequivocally romantic and sexual.  It is undeniable about the Centurion and his ""servant"".  The word of the original text is that of a younger lover.  No doubts at all, and Jesus called the Centurion the most righteous and faithful man in all Israel.   It is also true that modern people just don't get the pervasiveness of the sex magic rituals that were the basis of religion in that pagan era.  The Paganism of the times was based on the worship of the regeneration of life.  The people of that time thought that all life was in the male and his seed.  You literally could not walk out onto the streets without running into occult sexual acts being openly performed in public.    It is obvious how Christianity with it's strict morals would come into direct conflict with this world view, but what has that to do with two modern gays falling in love?"

Actually we don’t need more conversations.

When I love God and I know that God created other people regardless of their color as much as he made me, I don’t have a problem with racism. It’s solved!   Given he thinks racism doesn't exist anymore, even in the light of a half dozen black churches being set on fire and a white nationalist nutjob shooting up a bunch of people in a black church, he is pretty much as wrong as you can possibly get on all social issues.

However: they have absolutely no right to have been doing what they have done for centuries, and no right to demand special privileges to continue to act as morally incapacitated sociopathic bullies.  Maggie Gallagher (founder and former president of NOM) says the Christian right:   failed to establish lasting political institutions to channel social conservatives' influence. failed to put a humane face on its opposition to same-sex unions failed to communicate the message that ""Evangelicals don't dislike our gay and lesbian neighbors, and we don't mean them harm.""   Part of their lasting political legacy is the current bigoted batch of Republican presidential hopefuls, the entire Tea-Party wing of the GOP, and a number of other ""hate groups"" (including NOM itself) who wouldn't know a ""humane face"" from a death's head.  And that's been their problem: they went public after they tied their wagon to Nixon's Southern Strategy, and the age of the Internet (which they didn't see coming) has exposed their hatred, and the old ""it's God's will, not mine"" ploy doesn't work anymore.    Indeed, they don't ""dislike"" gays and lesbians; the conservative homophobes just want the religious freedom to stone them to death so that they can (in the religious imagination) get an early start at burning in hell for all eternity. While their legal freedom to commit literal mayhem (as they did to Alan Turing, for example) has been shrinking over the last century, they have continued to do what they could -- legal measures to imprison or forcibly silence (e.g. CA Prop 6 in '78); turning a blind eye to bullying, assault, or even murder when possible; and, of course, denying the rights granted to other parents and spouses by marriage. Now that they are reduced to asserting a religious privilege to act like utter asses in government offices and the public market (as long as they can get away with it), they will cry up a storm that they are denied the praise they think they deserve as martyrs for their faith.  They have convinced themselves that they are merely acting in accordance with the will of their God, and so they really do believe that their actions and influence, no matter how great the suffering they cause, are loving, humane and harmless by definition. I have wondered for almost 50 years what it would take to make these people recognize and take responsibility for the evil in what they do.  At long, long last, it has apparently become clear to a majority of the rest of the public, but the perpetrators continue to praise themselves and expect sympathy for their loss of public support.  Apparently, it will take at least another 50 years to sink in."

LGBTnews,3bcsc6,drewiepoodle,4,Sun Jun 28 00:11:57 2015 UTC,They seemed so eager to link Pride to ISIS. Shame nobody could recognize a butt plug.
LGBTnews,3bc98m,drewiepoodle,5,Sat Jun 27 21:10:47 2015 UTC,Suuuure they do.
LGBTnews,3bb90d,drewiepoodle,5,Sat Jun 27 15:47:14 2015 UTC,"Wow that writer really accused her of stereotyping men right after she expressed how happy she is with her girlfriend and her sexuality?! Then decided her smile was some sort of agreement? That's...really uninformed. I can imagine politely giving a ""you're an idiot"" smile right after that kind of comment."
LGBTnews,3bb3v6,drewiepoodle,2,Sat Jun 27 14:57:50 2015 UTC,"Seems silly to think this is the end of it.  The SCOTUS affirmed the right to abortion decades ago and we're still wrestling over it.  How do you expect they won't keep making silly laws to infringe on this right, followed by years of court rulings slapping them down and repeat?"
LGBTnews,3bb8v9,drewiepoodle,2,Sat Jun 27 15:46:00 2015 UTC,I have met him. Super nice guy
LGBTnews,3bb08t,drewiepoodle,3,Sat Jun 27 14:21:00 2015 UTC,"This is good. Enjoy the celebration, but point out there's still work to be done."
LGBTnews,3bb08t,jaycatt7,2,Sat Jun 27 14:37:53 2015 UTC,Nor is the work done for LGB activists. The next (and hopefully final) step is full inclusion in legislation as a class protected from discrimination.
LGBTnews,3b9x6b,drewiepoodle,2,Sat Jun 27 04:40:57 2015 UTC,Clearly excluding gay people from things is more important to him than the institution of marriage.
LGBTnews,3b70n8,volatile_chemicals,6,Fri Jun 26 14:10:40 2015 UTC,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LGBTnews,3b70n8,megloface,4,Fri Jun 26 15:09:57 2015 UTC,Love wins!
LGBTnews,3b9jx4,mtrai,2,Sat Jun 27 02:23:55 2015 UTC,We had it for 10 years...
LGBTnews,3b9jx4,AiwassAeon,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:39:51 2015 UTC,Clearly they hate gay people more than they love America.
LGBTnews,3b9jx4,QueerandLoathinginTO,2,Sat Jun 27 11:22:39 2015 UTC,That or they are truly morons and do not realize that Canada has had same sex marriage for a decade at this point.
LGBTnews,3b9jx4,QueerandLoathinginTO,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:46:26 2015 UTC,That doesn't contradict what I said.

LGBTnews,3b9ssw,drewiepoodle,2,Sat Jun 27 03:53:11 2015 UTC,"Sure, they've got to establish their credibility with the theocratic thugs and bully-boys of the Republican party base; but the key question is: can they maintain the required level of apoplectic stupidity for the next 12 months until the convention, and then rapidly pivot to appear sane enough to fool a majority in the general election?"
LGBTnews,3b5ys9,drewiepoodle,2,Fri Jun 26 06:20:29 2015 UTC,"I don't the state intervening into the ritual of churches and their church services, but when it comes to church owned businesses, heck yeah.  If you take government money you may not discriminate against anyone, period.  If you want to be a bigot, do it on your own dime."
LGBTnews,3b60fy,drewiepoodle,2,Fri Jun 26 06:41:18 2015 UTC,Kevin Tsai was outted himself in the early 2000s... I think we live in a facade of acceptance (those who subscribe to this sub probably are pro-lgbtqa) that we forget the other half of the world still have a VERY strong anti-gay agenda.  Asia is still 20-30 years behind on gay rights.
LGBTnews,3b5wst,drewiepoodle,2,Fri Jun 26 05:56:15 2015 UTC,"The AG and other Republicans argue against accepting the Court ruling based on federalism, and that the lower jurisdiction should have authority.  So how in the world does the AG interpose himself as the authority over the counties?  Does the Constitution expressly reserve the power of Supreme Court implementation to states attorney general?  Shouldn't that power be reserved to the counties and the people respectively as federalism requires?"
LGBTnews,3b5wst,corathus59,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:24:00 2015 UTC,"So, when it comes to liberal or progressive initiatives, the Texas State Government literally imposes its will onto the counties. Earlier this year after Denton County passed a fracking ban the legislature made it so bans could only be issues on a state level. The congressmen routinely bring up bills to make City Non-discrimination Ordinances illegal. As a Texan it is something that I witness regularly.  EDIT: Not that I think a ""ban"" on Same sex marriage would hold up or even be followed by the counties. There's gonna be one final cry and whine from conservatives after its legalized so that during the next election cycle they can have a ""though on gays"" star on their resume."
