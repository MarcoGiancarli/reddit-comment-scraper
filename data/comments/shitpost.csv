I am a single, 22 year old female, and would consider myself to have a healthy sexual appetite. That being the case, I have had partners in the past tell me that I tend to be a bit more on the aggressive side compared to other women they have slept with. Yesterday my friends and I decided to go out drinking and dancing. We entered a club we have never been to before, when I spotted this dude sitting at a table with a bunch of other guys. I noticed him almost right away since the hanging light over their table illuminated his face like a beam of light from heaven; this guy was so painfully attractive it hurt. My friends and I grabbed a table and a few drinks before hitting the dance floor. It wasn't long before the guy and his friends entered the dance floor from the opposite side of the room. I shuffled my way though the crowd and ""haphazardly"" started dancing with him. After he offered to buy me a drink, it was pretty obvious were things were headed. I don't go home with casuals very often but when I do I like to see the surprise on their face when I initiate fun-times, especially when its obvious they are used to making the first move. It was obvious this guy liked the power struggle of it so we ended throwing each other around a bit. Skip forward to this morning when I'm woken up by this guy in bed beside me absolutely freaking out about not being able to see and retinal tears and degeneration in his eyes. So I called the ambulance and went with him to make sure he was ok. I could feel my face go beat red with embarrassment while he is giving the paramedic information about how he thinks the throttling we gave each other caused the degenerative holes in his retina to tear and cause blindness and that he should have had laser surgery sooner.  I am currently in the waiting room of a hospital waiting to hear back about a guy I honestly can't remember the name of. :S  TLDR: Fucked a guy's retinas off  UPDATE: Reddit you saved me from an awkward situation!! 40 mins after being in the waiting room, Good-Girl-Gina-Nurse saved my ass! 30 mins or so after, she brought him out to the waiting room wearing a padded eye patch on the right eye and was surprised I hung around for so long. He seemed in relatively good spirits and said he could really go for some sherbert, so we went down to the hospital's cafeteria. I told him he was internet famous and asked if he used reddit, which he did not, but we spent the next hour laughing at all your comments.  He wanted to keep his name anonymous but thanks you from the bottom of his heart for all the concern and shared laughs. He also wanted you to know that his retina's are doing good, are on the mend, and will regain complete vision again.  He said the whole ordeal kinda went down like this.  Update#2: Dear u/Lostzilla815 who wrote me a message titled ""You are a slut"" and saying ""You should only sleep with a boyfriend"" You are a basement dweller and you should really shave your neckbeard. <3"

Also, 10 years ago, if one of your crew of friends had some beard, it'd be fine, but since then it's become a uniform worn by every second white urban male to go along with their handlebar moustache, ironic tshirt and incessant harping on about craft beer.

shitpost,3d2za4,Humperdink34,52,Mon Jul 13 08:25:16 2015 UTC,"This is probably the worst type of submission on here. Every time a notable celebrity dies, you can expect a flood of ""RIP"" posts with the first Google result for when his name is searched. 90% of the people who are ""mourning"" barely knew who we was before he died. Now, we have dozens of cheap karma grabs, and everyone will forget about this in a week, just like every other dead celeb. Of course, if I said this in that thread, I'd get hounded with the typical ""different ways to grieve"" spiel. Because I heal by getting sweet link karma. Besides, IMHO I don't really care about him dying. Shigeru Miyamoto will be the one I'll be sad about. It's just annoying to see people acting like he was some sort of god."
shitpost,3d2za4,Sleevepup,52,Mon Jul 13 03:55:12 2015 UTC,My favorite will always be the Paul Walker circlejerk. Nobody gave a shit about him before his passing but right after his crash he was suddenly everyones favorite actor and everyone had some bs story about him.

However that didn't stop hundreds of people falling over themselves to pretend they were his friend and reap sympathy points over such an event. Funny how everyone had a ""story"" about him after he died, but not many people truly talked to him in depth before he committed suicide.  Honestly it makes me sick."

Iwata was an incredible man with a good heart and artistic vision that was directly responsible for millions of hours worth of fun around the world. It's just that sometimes your life is cut short, or, in the case of Iwata, it comes to end. There is a difference. I don't find myself actively lamenting the latter anymore. People are saying 55 is way too young to die, but one can only hope to live so long. 55 is plenty of time to play your part, and Iwata is proof of that.  So rest in peace, Iwata, you did a great job."

shitpost,3d2za4,REDNOOK,2,Mon Jul 13 17:08:38 2015 UTC,"It's a damn shame to think most people are creating shitposts like this without actually recognizing his accomplishments. Miyamoto's a big icon for Nintendo, but I think it's important to acknowledge what others in that company have done as well.  Case in point: Iwata not only compressed Pokemon Gold/Silver enough to fit the Kanto region in there (when Gamefreak was struggling to add one more town beforehand), he reverse-engineered the Pokemon battle system in just one week for Pokemon Stadium (N64), apparently without even any specification documents.  In that light, losing a talent like that is pretty rough. But I'm a videogames-guy more than anything; I wasn't terribly moved by Nimoy's or Robin's deaths, so to each his own."

shitpost,3d2za4,BoxMacLeod,16,Mon Jul 13 15:29:33 2015 UTC,"What you need to put into perspective is that Satoru Iwata brought a lot to the company table that simply won't be the same now that he's gone, or cease to exist.  He's the one responsible for how fun and self-aware Nintendo's been these last few years. He also brought us the Nintendo Direct, personally presenting the content himself.  Then there's Iwata Asks, where he basically goes in depth with the game developers of Nintendo games.  The dude was a very personable CEO. I don't think I've seen anyone else quite like that."

So now I'm on a quest for the ultimate proof, and I think I've got it.  How about I repost my ID, leaving my initials to view.  I can then go into my bank account, print screen, cover all the important info except my initials and a balance.  You tell me how much to transfer from that balance.  I do that and then print the new screen.  This would show that the person who's ID says DOB 1959 (me), is also the person who just went and made changes to her bank account.  Unless maybe people would think I got my mom to do all of this just for my entertainment?  Or maybe you have another suggestion?    But then if I do find a way to prove things, people would have to accept that I am actually a 55 yr old grandma who smokes (and grows) that dank weed, reddits like someone much younger, and likes that my grandson is into gaming.
