TheFacebookDelusion,3dq40b,5quirrel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:34:52 2015 UTC,"Your ""Uber Christian Friend"" mentions how the athiests tried to rewrite the history of FDR's speech and, at the same time, tries to rewrite the efforts of Thomas Jefferson to separate religion from government.  Jefferson wrote, what became, the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom and was the basis for the first amendment which explicitly states that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion   Jefferson's original bill ""for establishing religious freedom,"" drafted in 1777 and introduced in 1779, was tabled in the face of opposition among powerful members of the established Church of England. Then, in 1784, a resolution calling for a tax to support all Christian sects excited such opposition that James Madison saw an opportunity to reintroduce Jefferson's bill. It passed both houses of the General Assembly with minimal changes to its text. One of the most eloquent statements of religious freedom ever written, the statute influenced both the drafting of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the United States Supreme Court's understanding of religious freedom.   And let's not forget that Jefferson also rewrote the New Testament to exclude any mention of miracles or other illogical accounts.   Much of the material Jefferson elected to not include related miraculous events, such as the feeding of the multitudes with only two fish and five loaves of barley bread; he eschewed anything that he perceived as “contrary to reason.” His idiosyncratic gospel concludes with Christ’s entombment but omits his resurrection. He kept Jesus’ own teachings, such as the Beatitude, “Blessed are the peace-makers: for they shall be called the children of God.” The Jefferson Bible, as it’s known, is “scripture by subtraction,” writes Stephen Prothero, a professor of religion at Boston University."

I dated this real cute girl when I was 16,  she was same grade as me from another high school.   She was attractive, wild but not too much so,  and generally a blast to be around.    Fast forward to 20.   She and I end our high school relationship.  She gets married about 4 weeks later to her best friend's brother.   He'd always had a crush on her,  but he was a bit overweight (well more than a bit) and I wasn't so I'm sure I stood in the way of anything he may have ever thought of.   But when we broke up,  I suppose he just jumped to snatch that up soon as possible.   Anyhow,  this isn't a problem really,  he was an okay guy,  just thirsty as hell, awkward,  and crazy weird.  So his best friend is a good buddy of mine at my high school.    A guy I'll call Chet.  So fast forward about 2 years.   Apparently religion become her sole focus.   Chet went over to their house and was trying to get the guy to hurry up cos they were going fishing.  He was taking a bit of time and chet is a hilarious guy but impatient,  and starts prattling off all sorts of silly insults,  peppered with profanity.   She comes out and calmly tells him to leave the house and never come back,  because she will not have him tainting their home.    They didn't see each other much after that,  Chet and him had been friends for almost 15 years at this point,  but being as the guy was, he'd do anything she said.  I just found it crazy when chet told me cos really,  she NEVER seemed like she'd go that route.  Weird."

In 2012, images were released showing five of the six Apollo missions' American flags erected on the Moon still standing (the Apollo 11 flag was accidentally blown over by the takeoff rocket's exhaust, but is still there).

The only reason you put in that caveat is the ministers in the news being sued for refusing to host a gay wedding run a for-profit chapel.    It has to be a nonprofit because those people and institutions are not and never were in danger of being sued for not performing weddings, which is an extremely easy concept to grasp. Nobody is suing an actual church/synagogue/mosque or an actual minister/rabbi/imam for refusing to perform or be party to a gay wedding, or any ither type of wedding they don't wish to participate in.   The reason I put in that caveat is that caveat determines whether a case has merit or not to begin with.  The federal government, the IRS, and the courts do not care how much religious frippery someone drapes on a for-profit endeavor, because simply by being for-profit they are public accommodations, and public accommodations have to serve everyone equally.  The bakery, as the judgement showed in the court case, was, in fact, brought to task for disseminating information that led to harassment and death threats of two private citizens. Their discrimination brought them righteous condemnation from the court of public opinion, but our legal system was only concerned with the aforementioned destruction of the safety if two people who did not ask to be threatened with bodily harm because they asked for a cake.  The pizza place was a failing business who bilked gullible morons out of thousands of dollars for pretending to take a stand against something they were never in danger of encountering."

Saul (who would later become Paul) imprisons many Christians Jews plot to kill Paul King Herod (believed to be Agrippa I)executes James and imprisons Peter Paul and Barnabas driven out of Antioch of Pisidia. Jews and Gentiles attempt unsuccessfully to stone Paul and Barnabas  Paul stoned nearly to death Paul and Silas are flogged and imprisoned in Thessalonica. Paul and others are chased out of successive towns Paul is made to appear before the Roman proconsul Gallop in Achaia, who dismisses the case as an internal dispute. Paul is then beaten Worshippers of Artemis in Ephesus riot against Paul and his companions. In his final journey to Rome, Paul is taken by Jews in Jerusalem to be killed, but is rescued by Roman soldiers who imprison him. He testifies before the Sanhedrin, and the governor Felix at Caesarea before using his power as a Roman citizen to have his case heard by the emperor.   Yep, checks out. Exactly the same."

TheFacebookDelusion,3cempg,warriormonkey03,8,Tue Jul 7 12:21:02 2015 UTC,Bake a cake for them? Sure. Bake a cake with hate speech on it? Nope. You can be forced to offer your services to everyone. You can't be forced to offer a specific service.
TheFacebookDelusion,3cempg,odoyle66,11,Tue Jul 7 12:24:05 2015 UTC,"No, so long as it's a normal cake. You cant refuse service because you don't believe the same things they do. You could probably refuse a cake that contained Slurs like God Hates Fags or whatever so long as you wouldn't make it for anyone else, and you would make them a cake you'd sell to someone else.  Edit: read that wrong. Yes a gay bakery should be forced to bake a cake for WBC for the above reasons."
TheFacebookDelusion,3cempg,warriormonkey03,12,Tue Jul 7 12:24:34 2015 UTC,I would sell them a plain cake and tell them that they can write anything they want on it after they purchase it.

There have even been preachers in Canada who have been fined for saying gay marriage is against the Christian faith (spoiler- it is).  I used to support gay marriage, here in South Africa it’s been legal for a long time, but the people who disagree being forced to participate or face a fine, or bizarrely being labelled “not true Christians” has put me off supporting gay rights."
TheFacebookDelusion,3cempg,not_shadowbanned_yet,13,Tue Jul 7 13:49:32 2015 UTC,"If it's a photography business and not a freelancer than yes. Public business should not be able to decline service based on protected classes (including religion). A freelancer can turn it down as they aren't the same thing as a business but just do weddings on the side.  I can't speak to how Canada works as I'm from the USA. Had that preacher been in the US I would defend him as that's a violation of Freedom of Speech. The government government can not and should not ever fine anyone for their opinion no matter how offensive.  Sorry you feel like you are being attacked but the truth is that Christians in first world countries are not persecuted. You enjoy any and all freedoms available to the public, you just have to hear people bitch about ignorant views from the church. Gays are denied services and freedoms while also getting the brunt of verbal abuse. So any time you feel persecuted just remember that your business is welcome at any establishment and that people will stop saying stuff to you if you quit harassing LGBT."

You’d probably say something about how churches get tax breaks and you can’t promote hate speech against protected classes, or something.  You assuming I believe in sky fairies, or worship a bronze age hobo just because I don’t go along with forcing Christians to do things they consider immoral is very revealing. Christians are blatantly persecuted in some Western countries- for example, in the UK burning a Quran is hate speech, but burning a bible isn’t.   You guys accuse these people of being bigots, but at this point you’re the ones being intolerant of different ideas. Forcing someone to take part in a ceremony they believe they will be tortured forever for participating in, telling them they shouldn’t be allowed to pursue their careers of choice for this belief, and then writing off their objections as paranoia."

Just because I think someone is a racist or a bigot doesn't mean the government should be able to fine them over those ideals. Freedom of Association is an interesting subject and very telling. As it turns out, in the public sphere your Freedom of Association is controlled entirely by you. You become the responsible party. If you do not want to associate with other people in that public sphere, you are to remove yourself. By attempting to limit public options and deny service to a group of people, you are infringing on their freedoms. You do not get to participate in the public and have people removed because you do not like them, instead you should remove yourself."
TheFacebookDelusion,3cempg,warriormonkey03,-8,Tue Jul 7 14:31:38 2015 UTC,"I can’t believe you don’t see the inherent double standard here. You’re the one advocating for people to be removed from the public and denied their rights.   “Nobody’s forcing you to do anything, but if you don’t do this thing we’re forcing you to do you have to go out of business.”  None of the gays I know are exactly monogamous. Even Dan Savage advocates for a system he calls “monogomish”. I’m becoming more and more convinced that this whole gay marriage thing isn’t about equal rights at all, but another passive aggressive bit of spite against the religious, like the ground zero cross or christmas decorations in public spaces."
TheFacebookDelusion,3cempg,not_shadowbanned_yet,7,Tue Jul 7 14:39:04 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not. You have every right to remain in the public sphere so long as you treat each and every member of the public as equals. If you are not willing to treat everyone as an equal, you should remove yourself or business from the public and become private. The same goes for any person or business who wants to refuse service to religious persons.  Human rights come before religious rights. If your religion is going to force you to deny human rights then there is an issue.   As for Christmas decorations and a cross at ground zero or whatever, if you want it in the public sphere then you must be willing to accept equal representation of all decoration. Christian privilege is the idea that you get cross and decorations wherever you want but no other religion can do the same."
TheFacebookDelusion,3cempg,warriormonkey03,-6,Tue Jul 7 15:11:17 2015 UTC,"Then atheists should petition to allow other religions to publicly celebrate their holy days, rather than trying to ban Christian decorations. They should support people of various faiths mourning their loved ones, rather than protesting the display of an artefact that gives Christian grievers some comfort.  What do you think of certain stores no longer stocking the confederate flag? If a business sells historical flags, it should be forced to sell the confederate flag too. What about a tattoo shop refusing to tattoo a neo-Nazi? He doesn’t want a swastika, but the tattoo shop is really good at doing eagles, should the artist be forced to draw an eagle between two pre-existing swastika tattoos? What about a banner printing place that has a standard “love isn’t a crime” design for gay pride parades, would they be forced to print the exact same design for a NAMBLA group?  Imagine you lived in a society where something you consider immoral has been legitimised. Imagine you’re an abolitionist while slavery was illegal, forced to take part in an anti-abolition rally. Imagine a society where child brides are allowed, an Islamic country or some insane future where “marriage is about love, not consent”.  You know what, I don’t know why I’m wasting my time. None of the examples I provide will convince you. You believe that people should be forced to adhere to your morality, and that theirs should be undermined. All in the name of “secularism”. This is the problem with any religion, and I don’t care if you scoff at me saying this due to a technicality, but at this point atheism is just another fucking religion. You don’t want a truly secular society, you want one based on your own progressive ideals and morals. Those who disagree? They must be removed. They have no right to differ. They’re idiots for even thinking they should have such a right. They’re hateful because they have a different opinion and want to choose what they’re involved with."
TheFacebookDelusion,3cempg,Yakukoo,3,Tue Jul 7 15:28:03 2015 UTC,"Atheists do petition. Have you ever heard of the Satanic Temple? They are a group dedicated to erecting monuments in public space anywhere a religious monument stands. Whenever the religious fight them putting their religious monument down and get it banned, they also inadvertently get theirs removed. The government and public needs to have equal respect for all religion, end of story.  If a store wants to stock the Confederate flag they should be allowed to, like wise if they don't then they shouldn't have to. You cant force them to purchase a specific item to sell, that isn't comparable to any point you are even arguing. If a store DOES choose to stock the Confederate flag, or any flag for that matter, they should be required to sell that flag to any person who comes in to purchase it. For your tattoo example, yes, if you already do tattoos of eagles for other people, you get to do them for everyone, neo-nazis included. For the banner place same rules apply, if you sell something to Joe down the road you must sell the same thing Joe bought to NAMBLA. It's an easy concept. If you would do something for one person, you do it for all persons. If you deny someone a specific request, it must be denied for all people. It's a pretty simple concept.   I do live in a society where things exist that I do not like. I deal with them and try and see them objectively. I think it's ridiculous that Christian holidays are used for federal holidays but no other religion. I think it's ridiculous that parents deny their children health care based on personal belief while ignoring science and medicine. I think it's insane that in 2015 race is still an issue and a decent portion of the population doesn't believe racism exists while saying some extremely racist shit.  I'm sorry you think this is pointless but I'd really like you to explain the double standard you see more clearly. How would you feel living in a society where you are denied service because you where a cross necklace? Is that not discrimination and an infringement on your rights? Is if not discrimination if I serve Joe a cheeseburger but refuse you the exact same order because of your religious beliefs? Do I have the right not serve you as a public business all because of your religion? Even if I'm already providing that same service to Joe? Doesn't this all sound insane? My point is you need to treat all people the same no matter what makes them different. Someone's religion, race, gender, orientation, whatever can not hurt me. Selling a Christian a cheeseburger and selling an atheist a cheeseburger are the same thing. It's the same service. Making the same T Shirt design for NAMBLA or an LGBT event are the same as making one for a church camp. It doesn't take me more energy, or increase costs, or any other bullshit reasons to make NAMBLA a shirt just because I disagree with them. So treat people as equals and you'll be treated as one as well."

I’d similarly defend the rights of Christians willing to participate in a gay wedding, but their interpretation of the book would be less accurate with regard to what it actually said.  Let’s pretend you’re right, and they just refused this lovely gay couple a cake they would have sold to anybody else just because they’re gay. If that’s part of their religion, and they can no longer practice it, their way of life would be under threat, so you could call them immoral, you could call their behaviour a violation of someone’s rights, but you couldn’t call their belief that their way of doing things was under threat ""paranoid"".

Why can't we just open restaurants where we only serve blue eyed, blond hair individuals because serving anyone else would be against my Nazi beliefs. As a public business, you are obligated to serve anyone who is also within their legal boundaries as a customer. In your scenario, the ""God hates fags"" shirt is a removable article and can be considered in offense of the companies dress code, and it is therefore permissible to ask them to step out of the store and change before coming in to order. I do agree that the WBC should be served by the gay baker, but if they ask for something obscene, such as writing ""God Hate's Fags"" on the cake, the gay baker should be allowed to decline to produce the cake because they don't produce cakes with offensive language regardless of religion/belief. They can't, however, decline to make a cake that says ""God bless the WBC"", because they would surely make a cake that says ""God bless America"" or anything along those lines.  We have freedom from religion as much as freedom of religion. Any christian, or muslim, or jewish person's religious freedom ends at the line where civil rights begin. That's not totalitarianism, that's common sense. If the lesbian woman had asked for a wedding cake that was in the shape of a vagina that said ""Homosexuality FTW"", the Christian baker is in every right to refuse that cake as long as they wouldn't make a vagina cake for a christian that says ""Christianity FTW"".

But, at least in the state of Oregon, homosexuals are a protected class; and, whether you agree with it or not, refusing to bake them a wedding cake on the grounds that you disagree with them getting married is discrimination against them.  If I told someone ""Sorry I don't bake cakes for weddings that take place in churches because I think religion is an abomination upon society"" then proceeded to pull out a Hitchens book and start reciting passages on how stupid religion is until they left my store, that is discrimination.   I think the issue your dealing with is that you are confusing the owner's rights with the obligations a business must partake in as part of an agreement with the community upon opening.  A business is an institution that offers a public service, and they must offer said service indiscriminately regardless of the owner's or any of the employee's beliefs."

Any individual is free to not participate in gay weddings or interracial weddings or anything else they want to not do.  A person can bake cakes all day long. They can not bake gay wedding cakes all day long. Nobody gives half of a flying shit about that. But when you open a business you agree to serve the public according to the laws of the state.

It should accommodate everyone and not discriminate according to the anti-discrimination laws in the state they're in. As someone already pointed out, it's the same law that prevents people from putting ""No blacks allowed"" signs in their windows.   I'm sure the lesbian couple can find another bakery...   This is nothing but blaming the victim. ""Oh she could've find another bakery ........................""   Yes. She COULD. But she doesn't HAVE TO. She has rights just like everyone else and she shouldn't be expected to go from bakery to bakery to bakery to bakery to find one that doesn't discriminate against her.   Even if it was the case, what if this would've happened in a deeply religious state like Louisiana for example or any other in the Bible Belt. Is it reasonable to ask the lesbian to go cross-state to find a bakery that would bake her a fucking cake?    Why where they so butt hurt about this bakery being douches. I mean acute loss of confidence and wight gain because someone doesn't want to bake a cake??   Because not only the Christian owners refused to bake her a cake for the simple reason that she's a lesbian and they didn't like that, but they also pulled the Bible and started quoting Leviticus and whatnot, yelling at her and calling her an abomination on top of it all. She left the bakery in tears because of these 'persecuted victims' as they portray themselves as.   US isn't a theocracy and Christians need to learn that. It's why they got such a high fine. To set an example for others who might want to ignore the laws. Not that they had to pay any of it from their own pocket ... 60k+ were already crowdfunded via GoFundMe before it was shut down by the site, since it's in their rules that you can't use it to pay for criminal activities and other law breaching fines and the rest is probably more than covered already with all the media attention they got over this.

It was probably the first time you heard the story.

I was clearly seeing it wrongly, like if you called a bakery and asked them to make some NSFW cake and they simply didn't want to.   No. No one can be forced to decorate the cakes or their creations in obscene ways, as long as they won't do it for anyone. If they'd be willing to bake a NSFW cake for a straight couple, they're required by law to bake it for a gay couple as well if they request it. If they wouldn't bake it for anyone, then it's not discrimination if they refuse to make it for a gay couple either.   I still think they got way too hurt about it but that's just me   She had a lot on her plate ... The lesbian had a rough time for being gay even before that, as for 2+ years, she's been persecuted, called names and even received death threats for it. It's entirely justified to burst in tears and feel sick when you're happy for finally being able to get married to the person you love, only to be met face to face with the bigotry you had to put up for years.   Damn you, I didn't want to read that last paragraph, I was hoping they'd had to close up shop...   I understand the sentiment, but it's for the better that it happened this way. There's a precedent set in court without putting the Christians out of business so that other Christians can point fingers at it and fuel their persecution complex. Furthermore, it's a win-win, since they can call it an act of God that they didn't have to close shop / pay an enormous amount from their own pocket."

Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. 4 For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. 5 Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.

Children lack the capacity to give meaningfully informed consent to such relationships.  That we are not permitted to engage in relationships that lack meaningfully informed consent from all involved parties is not an inequality between us and non-paedophiles.  It's just an unfortunate situation for us to have desires that lack the capacity for ethical expression.  I'm more interested in facilitating simpler access to a mental healthcare system with the funding and research necessary to address the struggles we face and support from the non-paedophile community in being a proportionally respected and productive part of society as a whole.  That some nutbags, or groups of them (NAMBLA for example) seek to legislate their nonsense about fucking children into existence does not alter my position one whit.  NAMBLA is like our Family Research Council, Westborough Baptist Church or Islamic State.  However fucked up things are normally, they'll be there trying to make it worse.  I oppose them as much as I oppose anyone else advocating things that shouldn't happen.  The ""kill the gays bill"" that got thrown out of Californian courts recently.  The ""register the atheists"" bill that got thrown out in Florida a few years back.  And so forth.  Equality or fairness doesn't mean everyone gets everything they want all the time.

For example: I voted to legalize marijuana in my state but I have no desire to use it because I think what you should be permitted to do and what you should choose to do are often very different things.  I suspect similarly about pornography in general.  I don't condemn it, I still indulge in adult live action pornography and various animation which can be helpful for its, ahem, ""intended purpose"", but I lack the data points to make any concrete claims as to its overall health.  I think masturbation and general self-love is an important part of a healthy sexuality but I'm still uncertain on the safety of fiction (of any genre) in the formation and growth of thoughts, beliefs and behavioral patterns.  I've found important insight for my own life in the fictional works of great minds, and not so great ones, but I know horrible things have arisen from their inspiration as well.  I enjoy much of the allegory and rationalist philosophy in supremely broken stories like the Sword of Truth and Atlas Shrugged but don't agree with many of the overall conclusions of Ayn Rand or Terry Goodkind or the way such philosophies are used to justify unethical conduct by others.  So I'm in somewhat of a quandary about fiction in general."

Surely it's better for it to endure several minutes of slight pain than to be killed and never live again. Hell, I bet most people would rather be raped than killed. How is killing animals (or humans) not cruel? Also, would it be cruelty if you put it to sleep first, then did your thing, and then released it into the wild, blissfully ignorant of anything that happened? What about fisting a cow? Surely that's rape, but it happens daily to billions of cows. And animal cruelty isn't legal for all animals - cows, pigs, bulls etc. live in stress and suffer daily and almost no one gives a shit, and it's legal. And then the main point, which was consent.

It wasn't sexual intercourse, so it wasn't rape? What happens to the male offspring of those cows (outside of factory farms, which is a tiny percentage of all farms)?

Being in a body that doesn't suit you isn't a mental illness anymore than having legs that aren't of even length.  When that happens we don't teach people they need to walk with congenitally defective legs we correct the physical defect.  We shouldn't try to teach people to live in bodies that don't work for them when we can so simply, with hormone therapy and corrective surgery, make their body how it should have been from the start.  The mind is who one is.  The body is just what one wears.  If it doesn't fit correctly they have the basic human right to put on something that does and thus be comfortable in their own skin.  Whether transgender or transhuman we have the technology to help people be more who they wish to be and I, for one, support that wholeheartedly."

TheFacebookDelusion,3blstt,FlamboyantTurd,2,Wed Jul 1 06:21:41 2015 UTC,"Homosexuality was considered a mental illness by the same soft-science that you're using to classify transgendered individuals.  Psychology has come a long way but much of the field is still mired in that past where hypotheses were given more weight than they had earned with evidence.  Until psychology rests solely upon evidence based research and classification it's not science whatever you want to say about it.  By the way.   Evidence suggests that people who identify with a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth, may do so not just due to psychological or behavioral causes, but also biological ones related to their genetics, the makeup of their brains, or prenatal exposure to hormones.      Many transgender people and researchers support declassification of GID because they say the diagnosis pathologizes gender variance, reinforces the binary model of gender,[9] and can result in stigmatization of transgender individuals.[8] The official classification of gender dysphoria as a disorder in the DSM-5 may help resolve some of these issues, because the term gender dysphoria applies only to the discontent experienced by some persons resulting from gender identity issues.[8]      In December 2002, the British Lord Chancellor's office published a Government Policy Concerning Transsexual People document that categorically states, ""What transsexualism is not ... It is not a mental illness.""[62] In May 2009, the government of France declared that a transsexual gender identity will no longer be classified as a psychiatric condition.[63]   So even the soft-scientists acknowledge that it's not exclusively psychological and that the dysphoria refers exclusively to the discontent rather than the validity of such.  I'd be discontent if I had a body that didn't match the gender I held myself to be.  Which leads governments and even the DSM itself away from the classification you use."

This is what I posted on the image that showed up in my feed:  Straight pride:  When those homos are getting the same rights as me and I as a straight person need to establish that I am superior because I am the majority.  See also:  white power."
TheFacebookDelusion,3biqr1,GavinSnowe,8,Tue Jun 30 04:01:43 2015 UTC,"Your friend is likely posting that for all the wrong reasons but I think it does kind of touch on the ridiculousness of pride. I'm not a fan of gay pride parades, black history month, affirmative action etc. because I think we should just treat people as people. I don't look at gay people any different to straight people, so I don't think they need an annual event to march through the streets and parade the fact they're gay. I don't look at black people or Asian people any different to white people so I don't think we should have a month celebrating the history of a certain race or have to meet quotas of racial diversity in the workplace. If society ever truly evolves to the point of accepting everyone as equal and people don't feel their sexuality, ethnicity or even gender are a cause of negative treatment then things like this won't have a place anymore. But that's just my opinion, probably gonna get called a racist, misogynistic homophobe because reddit."
TheFacebookDelusion,3biqr1,JimmyT91,8,Mon Jun 29 18:18:40 2015 UTC,"I agree. In an ideal world people would just be people no matter what colour their skin, who they sleep with, etc. Unfortunately, this isn't an ideal world, and there are still a frightening number of people who view others as lesser human beings because they fall into a specific sub-group.   For people who for a large part of their lives hid a part of who they were, because they were ashamed of it, because they were bullied for it, abused verbally and physically, things like the pride parade are a life changing thing; an opportunity previously unimaginable, to celebrate who they are and not be afraid.   I think that's why stuff like ""straight pride"", or "" white pride"" leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I'd be willing to wager no straight person in America has ever been made to feel like they weren't good enough, that they're a lesser human because they are attracted to members of the opposite sex, so celebrating ""straight pride"" is completely superfluous, and just makes a person look like a petulant child, crying because they have to share the swing-set at the park.   Yes, pride parades might be slightly obnoxious, and too many people attend them because it's another excuse to get drunk and be loud; but for a lot of people it isn't. Hopefully one day we won't need pride parades, but as long as Kidd's are getting bullied in school to the point of suicide, we do."

As I thought, just a lot of baseless assertions and a quote from William Lane Craig, the biggest liar and manipulator in apologetics.   For example, some time ago I had a debate with a professor at the University of California, Irvine, on the historicity of the resurrection of Jesus. He had written his doctoral dissertation on the subject and was thoroughly familiar with the evidence. He could not deny the facts of Jesus’s honorable burial, his empty tomb, his post-mortem appearances   Absolute horrible bullshit. First of all, not even Jesus' life has any evidence, but is merely assumed by most historians because it's a trivial event - and that's fine. But a resurrection is not trivial and requires a bit more.  But most idiotic of it all, his post mortem appearances? Seriously? If him appearing to people after his death was a fact, then no one would dispute his resurrection. That's the same thing. This is just plain presupposition."

For those who want it without Google:   ""I am certainly not an advocate for frequent and untried changes in laws and constitutions. I think moderate imperfections had better be borne with; because, when once known, we accommodate ourselves to them, and find practical means of correcting their ill effects. But I know also, that laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy, as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors."" - Jefferson to H.

The story of 'Noah's Ark' did not happen: seems like a reasonable claim, because when we look around at the world we do not see evidence/proof that the descriptive content of the story actually happened. And although we cannot prove that it definitely didn't happen with 100% accuracy, we can show, with science, that the Bible's description of Noah's Ark's occurrence is/was extraordinarily low.  The story of 'Noah's Ark' did happen: seems like an extraordinary claim, which needs extraordinary evidence/proof since we can show with extreme certainty that it most likely didn't happen. So where is the one shred of proof for it's occurrence? There are many many shreds of proof for the claim that the descriptive content of Noah's Ark did not occur, and not one for the claim that it did.  So if we looked around the world and the evidence/proof pointed towards Noah's Ark's occurrence, then to say that it did not happen would be the extraordinary claim; and then that claim would require extraordinary evidence/proof. As we live in a world where we do not see evidence/proof for it's occurrence, the burden of proof lies solely on the people claiming that it did happen. That's how evidence/proof and extraordinary claims works."

TheFacebookDelusion,3askwp,Spartan448,5,Tue Jun 23 20:30:44 2015 UTC,"Oral sex is just as important to cover as anal or vaginal sex. Every curriculum I have seen have incorporated education on safer decisions regarding these behaviors. I have never encountered one where these three were separated into distinct units. No, we don't need a demonstration on how to give a blowjob, and we're not giving a demonstration on how to insert a penis into a vagina. Sex ed is all about teaching decision making skills, such as choosing to refrain from vaginal sex and instead partake solely in anal or oral sex for reasons of celibacy or pregnancy prevention."
TheFacebookDelusion,3askwp,SpiritOfFi,-2,Tue Jun 23 20:51:40 2015 UTC,"But that's not the point of what sex ed classes is. They are supposed to be informative, educational courses. They should not be encouraging any kind of behavior, especially not sexually. The only time oral or ansl sex should be covered is a brief mention during the STIs/STDs unit mentioning that they are in fact valid transmission methods for said maladies. Beyond that there is no need to cover sex except in units on relationships and reproductive health, and in the case of the former there is still no need to cover oral or anal over sex in general (for most jurisdictions any kind of intercourse is illegal anyway for 4th graders), and in the case of the latter there's no need to cover them at all.   I know of no curriculums that devote any more than a passing mention of oral or anal intercourse. And that's a good thing. Given how short class times in the US are,  classes need to devote as much time as they can to the most important parts of the curriculum, and I think basic first aid, proper education on the reproductive process, proper education with regards to the consequences of intercourse and how to safely avoid those consequences, and proper education on maintaining positive relationships and exiting abusive ones, are all decidedly more important than learning that sucking dicks is a thing, something most 4th graders will already know about from the Internet anyway."
TheFacebookDelusion,3askwp,Spartan448,3,Tue Jun 23 21:10:30 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna be saying ""you"" but Im using it as a general pronoun for an instructor.  Sex ed uses information presented in an educational format to teach safer decision making. That is the comprehensive model. Kids are going to have sex. We provide all of the information they need to make an individual decision for themselves. To ignore oral and anal sex is to assume that your students will not be partaking in these activities, which is a very dangerous assumption when discussing STI prevention.   in the case of the latter [pregnancy prevention] there's no need to cover them at all.   The whole point of discussing oral and anal sex outside of STI prevention is to provide an alternative to vaginal sex, which is the only activity which can result in pregnancy. Moreover, some may feel that oral sex does not violate their concept of celibacy, and providing that information is incredibly important to the spiritual well-being of your students.  I agree with you to an extent about short time allotments, but that's a whole other issue which encroaches on this particular one."
TheFacebookDelusion,3askwp,SpiritOfFi,-2,Tue Jun 23 21:36:49 2015 UTC,"To ignore oral and anal sex is to assume that your students will not be partaking in these activities, which is a very dangerous assumption when discussing STI prevention.   But we've already covered that it should get a mention during a unit on STI/STD prevention as it is a valid method of transmission. If that's your only objection, I've already shown that it is covered under most existing curricula (in New York at least).   Moreover, some may feel that oral sex does not violate their concept of celibacy, and providing that information is incredibly important to the spiritual well-being of your students.   It is not the job of public schools to care for the ""spiritual well-being"" of students. Catholic schools maybe, but all a public school should be concerned with and dedicating time to is the physical, mental, and educational well-being of the students in attendance. If some poor Christian kid gets cold feet when his girlfriend offers to blow him, it's not the school's responsibility to say that's okay - if he really wants to know about that, he can either wait until his book says it's okay or he can look up on the internet that it doesn't violate celibacy. It's not the prerogative of the school to comment on such religious issues.   The whole point of discussing oral and anal sex outside of STI prevention is to provide an alternative to vaginal sex   And why may I ask should the school be doing this? Apart from the already twice discussed fact that at the level the article is discussing, intercourse of ANY kind is illegal in most jurisdictions, it's not the schools job to give kids ideas for how to fuck each other. If they really want to fuck that badly, there's condoms or birth control which would have been covered in a good sex ed class, or they can just look up on the internet ""how do I have sex without sticking it in the vagina"" (and most likely get linked to German dungeon porn but that's a whole different ball of wax at that point). Regardless it's not the school's job to inform the students about alternative ways of having sex."
TheFacebookDelusion,3askwp,Spartan448,5,Tue Jun 23 22:18:57 2015 UTC,"physical, mental and educational well-being   Spiritual well-being falls under mental well-being. It has nothing to do with any religious institution. Some people choose to be celibate and have no religious affiliation. One's personal concept of what is celibate and what isn't is subjective. We provide clear, objective information to allow an individual to form their opinion.   condoms or birth control   And what about those who are unable to get condoms or birth control?   not the school's job to inform the students about alternative ways of having sex   Although I realize that I did use the word alternative, that was in the context of that situation. Anal, vaginal and oral sex are all perfectly viable pinnacles of physical expression in an intimate relationship. Vaginal sex is no more ""real"" than anal or oral, and likewise for the others in reference. By separating them, you are saying that Vaginal sex is the only legitimate type of sex. There are relationships where a vagina is not present, and for people who are a part of these relationships the model you are supporting is inadequate.  Moreover, sex ed isn't a one time experience. It starts young with a foundation of information which will be further expanded on throughout a student's time in public schooling. I don't believe that teaching a 4th grader about vaginal sex is going to have any sort of long lasting impact, but opening subtle connections for future instruction to expand upon is a major part of sex ed, at least for the comprehensive model."

TheFacebookDelusion,3aki3t,Homsar98,0,Mon Jun 22 04:58:59 2015 UTC,I wish they'd quit reading the Old Testament.
TheFacebookDelusion,3aki3t,_Zeppo_,51,Sun Jun 21 19:19:30 2015 UTC,"Matthew 5:17-19 (KJV):  17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.  18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.  19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  Also, it does not matter if the NT somehow negates a lot of the OT. The same god that is supposedly the same as Jesus and at the same time is not (but why quibble on that part) is the same god that flooded the planet killing off nearly all life. It is the same god that allowed for slavery in Egypt (historians question the presence of Jewish slaves there but even as a story it doesn't help the god character)."
TheFacebookDelusion,3aki3t,NeoMegaRyuMKII,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:34:25 2015 UTC,"Sort of. After Jesus dies, there's this question of whether converted non-Jews needed to become Jews (i.e., circumcision, no pork, etc.) before they could join the Christian sect. They have a council to talk it over, and St. Peter has this dream showing a table of foods forbidden under Jewish law, with a voice saying it's no longer a sin to eat it.   So that's been interpreted to mean there's been some kind of divine amendment, one that's a bit slim on the details, obv.  Which leads to the real problem: the interpretation these fanatics are insisting on is inherently contradictory, since things that even the New Testament still forbids aren't considered to be a big deal these days, but gaysecks?!?!

It counts just as much, even if for only a pre-Jesus history lesson like some want it to be. Abrahamic religions as a whole do not have a happy past, and /u/NeoMegaRyuMKII gave you a very relevant verse."

Genesis 22:2: ""Then God said, ""Take your son, your only son, whom you love--Isaac--and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.""  Exodus 21:2-6: If you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve for only six years.  Set him free in the seventh year, and he will owe you nothing for his freedom.  If he was single when he became your slave and then married afterward, only he will go free in the seventh year.  But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife will be freed with him.  If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master.  But the slave may plainly declare, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children.  I would rather not go free.'  If he does this, his master must present him before God.  Then his master must take him to the door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl.  After that, the slave will belong to his master forever.   I can keep going. Believe me there is ALOT more."

He must be a racist bigot!"" Because I did in fact say that, but it can mean basically anything without its original context. I said it to make a point, but you took it (hypothetically!) as a reason to write me off as a hateful person.

Your kindergarten theology of ""well I'm sure it doesn't MEAN that."" Or ""There must be another answer!"" Is very disgusting.

There are rules dictating how much money should be given to a father by his daughter's rapist because her bride price is now worthless, I think it's 50 pieces of silver and her subsequent marriage to him. And there's plenty more, I just don't feel like being more depressed tonight.  FWIW, I'm Catholic. I'm not digging out verses from the Skeptic's Annotated Bible, I go to my NIV study bible. This is shit I have read multiple times and have had to come to grips with. Abrahamic religions have an ugly past, and it's really better to just accept the OT for the horrific glimpse into the past that it is. ""Apologetic"" pleas for ""context"" (like you can somehow make mass slaughter and the Jewish equivalent of jihadi brides sound better?) just lend credence to the fact that a lot of believers either haven't read the OT thoroughly, or that they can't accept that their religion is just as brutal as the other Abrahamic ones. No, Christians and Catholics might not have an equivalent to IS, but they are doing a lot of damage in other ways."

Born with bad eyes, have a thyroid issue, have a cleft lip? We better fix that stuff because it doesn't fit in with my idea of what god has planned.   Is someone born gay? That is definitely not part of gods plan and we should try to fix that, too.  A racist kills 9 people during a prayer meeting in a church and they still don't want to recognize that it must be gods plan. Instead they want to fix it.  And of course the ridiculous illogic of it all comes into play. If god knew it would happen, why did he allow it? Did god make it happen? If so there is no free will. Etc. Etc.  Meanwhile, children are starving to death and they think god works in mysterious ways or he needs more angels. Or some shithead gets his appendix removed and PRAISE THE LAWD, IT'S A MIRACLE!!

TheFacebookDelusion,3a6as5,diamond,32,Thu Jun 18 01:11:19 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the very premise of the article is absurd. We're supposed to believe that Christians working in Hollywood have to meet and pray in secret because their adherence to ""traditional values"" would get them blacklisted if the liberal elites in Hollywood knew. The problem is:  1) There are plenty of Christians in Hollywood, and not all of them are conservatives. Martin Sheen, for one, is a devout Catholic who talks openly of his faith in interviews. He is also a very outspoken progressive. Stephen Colbert is another one (not Movie Hollywood, but still a big name in the Entertainment industry).  2) If that's not enough, some of the true giants of Hollywood are openly and unabashedly conservative. Clint Eastwood and Arnold Schwarzenneger come to mind immediately. Last time I checked, their careers were doing just fine.  The simple fact is that the people running Hollywood care about one thing, and one thing only: Money. If you can make them plenty of it, they don't care if you're liberal, conservative, Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, Atheist or Satanist.  The persecution complex on display here is just so sad and painful to watch."

I asked her why I, as an atheist didn't care or was bothered by it and could she point me where people were outraged and got zero response. Me and another cousin started discussing Carrie and my other cousin loathes country music and was saying kill it with fire lol. So we go back and forth on the first cousins status and I'm telling her what good songs of Carries I like and she should listen to and the original cousin gets on her status and says that she loved us both but we had to stop attacking her beliefs. 8 fucking people liked the status when neither of us mentioned Carries religion. I asked wtf she was talking about but got no response. The other cousin went off on her and told her to actually get reading comprehension because neither of us even discussed religion. It was really bizarre. But it made me understand more that if you don't wholeheartedly agree with someone and their Christian beliefs, even if you have zero opinion, that amounts to attacking religion.

One day his boss wanted to humiliate him before the clerks.  He called the young man and said: - Young man come here, take this uranium and go to the fission generator and turn it into energy.  The young man replied: - I cannot convert matter into energy!  The boss said: - Well then ask for assistance of your Science!  Show us that it exist!  The young man takes the uranium and walks to the fission generator and begins the scientific method... ... ...  He converts the uranium PERFECTLY well into energy as the boss wanted.  The young man came out of the reactor and saw them all crying.  They all said together: - We want to study your science!  The young man was astonished, and asked what was going on?  The BOSS crying opened the reactor by showing the young man there was no energy in the reactor.  Then the boy said: See?  This is the Science I study, THE SCIENCE OF POSSIBLE AND TESTABLE, the Science who gives explanation to that which is in nature.  You may think there are things still impossible BUT WITH SCIENCE EVERYTHING HAS AN EXPLANATION.  To the person reading this, I pray that Science confirms A SUPER HYPOTHESIS in your life today in Science Name I Study.  Write 'QED' to claim this hypothesis."
