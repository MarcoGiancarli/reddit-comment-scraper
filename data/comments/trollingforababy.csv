trollingforababy,3ati9e,BabyNewf,2,Tue Jun 23 22:16:54 2015 UTC,I don't know. They haven't even called me with my appointment yet. I called to ask if I should have my SO's SA sent there since he is doing it tomorrow morning and while I had them on the phone I asked when I might expect to hear from them and they said right now they are booking for October appointments. Once I actually get my welcome package and intake call I will for sure ask about a cancellation list. That's a great idea.

The only appointment not in my fertile period was in a surrounding suburb this past saturday. SO got drunk the night before and was hungover in the morning, then drove all the way there and realized he forgot his lab requisition form and they refused to do the test and couldn't reschedule for weeks. I freaked out, sobbing on the phone when he told me. He felt terrible and promised to do better on this the next time. It is very unlike him to fuck things up like that, and apparently he didn't even realize he shouldn't have drank (although I swear I mentioned it) but it took me all weekend to recover. It would have been weeks before I would be able to make another appointment in the public labs system but this morning I called my new RE office and explained and they connected me to a private lab they use that bills the public health system so there is no private pay and they have way more flexibility, so it is now just a week and a half to wait.

This month I'm frustrated and annoyed and trying to not give a damn, seem to be doing OK so far since I think my hubby is an idiot lately and I don't want to be pregnant with him being a dumbass (he's probably not, like I said my head is effed).

I get positive opks, like, stealing colour from the control line frickin' positive wondfo opks and don't get temp rises. Looking back at March my temp didn't rise on one chart until a week after my + opks (and I hadn't BD'd and then got my 5 days later) and sometimes it doesn't rise at all. So, either I ovulate like, a week after my surge and have a 4-5 day luteal phase (in which case I am fucked right?)... or... I ovulate when I get my + opks and my hormones are messed up causing my temp not to rise and which is probably why I don't get full periods, just spotting for a day or two (in which case I am fucked right?). Blerg. I was feeling so positive about this cycle until this morning.  On top of this my doctor says I AM ovulating because I get + opks and gives zero fucks about my temperature or even seeing my chart. She thinks I am making it a full time job for myself and I need to relax.

She has tested my FSH and says things look okay :( At this point I am just waiting to get to the one year mark so I can get a referral.

It bothers me because, admittedly, I am cynical and bitter and have had so many negative tests I could build a bridge, but also because our sex education system teaches girls that pregnancy JUST HAPPENS, leading us to expect immediate results when finally we are trying to become pregnant, and therefore causing women to jump straight to ""THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME WHAT DO I DO"" when the first cycle yields negative results.  Don't even get me started on the ones who are trying for number 3 or 4 who complain about going on cycle 2. That's another rant altogether.  [Side note: I am not a miserable and unsympathetic human being-- I get that any negative is a disappointment, especially when you start off with high hopes.

While I put on normal picnic clothes (jeans, cute top, cardigan), he gets all dressed up. Sometimes he just wants to wear his fancy clothes and overdresses, so I didn't say anything.   I ask him where the picnic is and he gives me a cross street, near a park in the city. The park is full of winos but I figure, okay, rock and roll wedding, wino park, whatever. I ask him what time we should be there and he says, ""it doesn't really matter, we weren't invited to the ceremony, we can just show up."" So, rock and roll, cool.  We get there, and it's not a picnic, it's at a fancy restaurant CALLED Picnic that's across the street from the wino park. Everyone (except me) is wearing fancy dresses.

trollingforababy,309e38,flip_a_couch,3,Wed Mar 25 15:25:44 2015 UTC,This is what I went through when I had my Mirena pulled out after having it for 4 1/2 years.  I was fine for three days after it was removed. No spotting or anything. Then the flood gates opened. I bled heavily for 10 days. I also had an infection. A fever. And those 10 days were a blur because I spent pretty much all of it in bed. My bleeding did not taper off. I bled just as heavy from day 1 to day 10. Then it just stopped. The last few days I started taking medicine for the infection I had (It was some vaginal infection. I don't know if it had anything to do with the IUD or just shit timing.)  My doctor told me it could take up to 3 months to have a period and he recommended not getting pregnant in the first month after removal because the uterine lining might not be thick enough for the egg to attach to.   I tracked my cycle. Ovulated on time. Started my period on time. Got pregnant the next cycle. I know I was one of the luckier ones.
trollingforababy,309e38,Drusylla,4,Wed Mar 25 17:55:39 2015 UTC,"Holy shit this is literally happening to me right now. No bleeding at all Monday, tiny amount of spotting Tuesday, and today it's the fucking Shining in there and I'm cramping like a mofo. Do you know if all the bleeding threw off your cycle when it happened to you?  The RN who took mine out didn't say anything about avoiding getting pregnant for the first cycle, she was like 'congrats, maybe we'll see you back here in a couple of months!!! :D :D' meanwhile I'm like 'OMFG what have we done', lol.  According to my tracking app I should be ovulating right around now so in a couple of weeks perhaps I'll have a regular period?"
trollingforababy,309e38,Drusylla,3,Wed Mar 25 21:04:54 2015 UTC,"I did A LOT of research about what to expect after my IUD removal. I had read so many stories about it taking women 2+ years to conceive after their Mirena removal and all the issues they had. There were others who conceived right away but didn't stick and others who conceived and it stuck. I started tracking my cycle after the 10 day bleeding to make sure everything returned to normal. I had never had problems coming off birth control.  The 10 day bleeding was pretty much the hormonal ""crash"" my body went through. When I had the Mirena inserted, I bled constantly for 3 fucking months.  Anyways-This is how my doctor explained it to me. The Mirena thins out your uterine lining and/or makes it so you don't produce a lining. That's why your periods get lighter and you can end up with no more periods. No lining, no period. After removal, your body needs time to build back up that lining. How long varies person to person. So yes, you could get pregnant right away but if you don't have enough lining, the egg won't stick. He said it could take up to 3 months for the lining to build back up and to wait at least a month to start trying.  I started tracking my cycle the second I stopped my initial bleeding. I did NOT count that first blood after removal as a period. I had a normal 29 day cycle so we started trying in cycle 2.  'OMFG what have we done' was my reaction after I started bleeding. I told my husband that we needed to get pregnant ASAP because I did not want to deal with periods like that. Fuck that nonsense. After not having periods for 3 years, you definitely don't miss that shit."
trollingforababy,309e38,Drusylla,2,Wed Mar 25 22:57:02 2015 UTC,"It never occurred to me to do reading about what would happen after I got my Mirena out! It's my second one and I've been using it as bc for almost 10 years, I forgot what normal periods are like. The first one I had in I spotted on and off for about 6 months but didn't have any significant bleeding, with this second one it's been smooth sailing generally (until today!).  I'll make a note in my tracker app and see what happens. I'm totally fine with things taking a couple of months to sort themselves out."

But I don't want to start somewhere and leave immediately on mat leave (had a coworker do that and it was kinda annoying to immediately hire a temp for her position). I also really like the people here, they are like family, and I want to spend my pregnancy with them. Yo know, if there ever IS a pregnancy.   Ok, so that's what's going on in my life right now.

trollingforababy,2fvgt2,Fauxie,8,Tue Sep 9 03:20:19 2014 UTC,"Every post in reddit regardless of what subreddit it's submitted to can be seen if you sort by all subreddits and just look at newest posts. There are redditors (some trolls, some not) that view these newest posts and vote/comment on them whether or not they know/care anything for the subreddit. It is likely that one of these trolls hit you because I doubt anyone in the TFAB sub would have downvoted you! Like you said, it is a very supportive community!  One time I posted in /r/tfablineporn and got a comment from some random redditor asking what it was a picture of. I viewed his history and it was all porn related so I figured he must have seen it in 'new', seen the word 'porn' in the subreddit, and decided to comment. It felt weird to realize that redditors outside of our little TFAB bubble can also see what we post!  Also, because most of the posts we post are text based self-posts, not image or link based, they don't even get factored into your total karma so a lot of people don't even upvote text based posts, so if one or two trolls downvoted you, it could have negated the few people that upvoted.   Sorry you got downvoted! Just know it likely wasn't because of anything you did, just troll redditors being trolls!   Loved your gif too btw!

trollingforababy,2ejjly,LetterBoxx,4,Mon Aug 25 16:44:22 2014 UTC,"To be fair, the reasons I was crying included ""Because it's the second day of my period, my commute home was a clusterfuck, my whole body hurts, I'm gassy, I just bled all over my legs and the toilet, there's blood clots in the bath water, I'm not pregnant, I don't want to try again for another month, I saw a new pregnancy announcement and a gender reveal today on Facebook, my old friend is pregnant with her third, I hate that it seems so easy for her and for everyone else, I'm afraid I'm never going to be able to make us a baby, and I miss my Grandma.""   ""I'm gross"" seemed to sum that up most concisely, but apparently he missed some of the nuances of my response..."

trollingforababy,2efnrr,el_nynaeve,1 point,Mon Aug 25 02:50:40 2014 UTC,Well after 30 days of nothing and wirh a history of them I just took an educated guess.  Ofcourse it could still happen!

trollingforababy,2eaxhv,batswantsababy,1 point,Sat Aug 23 17:30:35 2014 UTC,I have a week to wait so I am right there with you. Although I've been like that for the last 3 months waiting fir my cycle to come to an end...so I have like brain damage now from banging for so long :P

trollingforababy,2eaxhv,HazMat68W,1 point,Sat Aug 23 04:08:22 2014 UTC,I got 11 days and I'm already that way.....I need to keep myself busy...
trollingforababy,2eaxhv,theotterisntworking,1 point,Sat Aug 23 13:12:48 2014 UTC,I've told myself that I'm waiting until I have serious symptoms or CD40 (I have very irregular cycles). But I know that I have a few strips sitting in the cupboard...!!!! It's hard not to test even though I have NO reason to think that this was the one!
trollingforababy,2eaxhv,el_nynaeve,1 point,Sat Aug 23 19:34:16 2014 UTC,"Me too!! At least, I'm currently 5dpo as well, but it looks like you submitted this a few days ago.  I used up all my internet cheapies and only have a clear blue digital that I don't want to waste on a 12dpo test, so I'm not going to use it until my period is actually late. If I literally start vomiting without reason, MAYBE I'll go get a dollar store one.  Also, have to say, I'm jealous of those women who apparently start ""feeling things"" on 4-5dpo. I'm like, how the hell do you have symptoms already?? It has me thinking I'm already out because I'm sitting here feeling totally normal at 5dpo :P"
trollingforababy,2eaxhv,el_nynaeve,1 point,Tue Aug 26 18:39:44 2014 UTC,finally at 9 dpo.  im entering tempting territory for testing.  now im starting to symptom spot like an idiot. nipples feeling like sandpaper was scratched on them. loooads of cm thats not normal for me. usually creamy is. this stuff is.. idk just different.  this morning i woke up feeling very very sick.   but i think im chalking all this up to dehydration and chugging water all day today.
trollingforababy,2e92um,el_nynaeve,2,Fri Aug 22 05:12:17 2014 UTC,Sorry :( Maybe you O'd earlier than you thought you would & here's hoping the little swimmers from Monday's BD were extra patient for you!
trollingforababy,2e92um,starrwith2rs,2,Tue Aug 26 04:38:06 2014 UTC,"Thanks :) we did get one last bd in on Thursday which turned out to be o day. Which also put our Monday session within the fertile period, and I had a ton of ewcm Tuesday and Wednesday to keep those suckers alive so I'm hopeful. Not the greatest odds but not really bad odds either either.  The fact that I didn't expect to o until Sunday or Monday didn't help the whole opk thing :P"
trollingforababy,2e92um,starrwith2rs,1 point,Tue Aug 26 17:56:56 2014 UTC,That O date is w wily thing! Also I just read somewhere that the BD'ing in the days prior has a better chance of conception because the sperm are there to meet the egg when it gets there so I think you have better odds than you might imagine! I'm pulling for you! Keep us updated!
