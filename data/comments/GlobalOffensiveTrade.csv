GlobalOffensiveTrade,3e28x3,Ozz123,2,Tue Jul 21 12:03:59 2015 UTC,"cool, didn't even know that existed, will do in my future giveaways :D"
GlobalOffensiveTrade,3e28x3,Ozz123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:05:27 2015 UTC,Yeah it's quite awesome done a couple of giveaways and 99% of the people are quite nice. Plus you get dank points for your giveaways which shows as flair.
GlobalOffensiveTrade,3e28x3,AverageSliceBread,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:06:45 2015 UTC,"sounds great, I love dank points"
GlobalOffensiveTrade,3e28x3,Paulmania,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:08:03 2015 UTC,"Hehe, plus the people who join have mostly small inventories with big amounts of hrs spent on csgo instead of the people joining here with 50+ keys :p"
GlobalOffensiveTrade,3e28x3,syn999,5,Tue Jul 21 12:10:02 2015 UTC,"Good luck to everyone and good on you for doing this! Not entering cause I am happy with my inventory and it's not about how big it is, it's what you do with it.  Also, some of you guys have really good inventories, I can't make you drop out, but if you have an inv over 10 keys, in my opinion, that's a lot. I mean, going through 3 trade links, I found 1 TigerTooth Karambit on one, 51 Keys on the 2nd account, and the last account I checked, AWP Asiimov, Kara Fade, Wasteland Rebel, a blue 5-7 CH and Desert Eagle Blaze.  And for anyone who trades their stuff to an alt, screw you."

Also if you have just a random number between the 2 points instead of a commonly guessed number it will take aprox 2500 comment for there to be a good chance someone guessed it already :P and thats not counting people guessing the same number twice.

GlobalOffensiveTrade,3e247j,Tacoparty87,0,Tue Jul 21 16:57:23 2015 UTC,Theoretically CHs are only worth what the buyer is willing to pay so if nobody will pay 700k then it is not worth 700k
GlobalOffensiveTrade,3e247j,WhyYouNoSmokeMid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:35:29 2015 UTC,"You can say that about every prices then -_-, but if the b/o is set for something, and there is no set prices, its still a lowball because he offers so much less than b/o and i know a guy who just sold one of these bayos for 740k, so the price is good."
GlobalOffensiveTrade,3e247j,Tacoparty87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:58:59 2015 UTC,All I'm saying is that it's not like slaughters where a specific pattern adds a specific amount of keys to the value. Lately CH prices have been getting harder to sell with the new knives. You could get that much if u find a lucky buyer but I have talked with a lot of bayo Ch owners and they had been trying to sell it for like 8 months. They wanted 500k for it but ended up selling it for 240k. So don't get mad at a guy for offering when I do not see any other offers or and c/os on the thread

GlobalOffensiveTrade,3e3mic,crowcl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:28:42 2015 UTC,"For CH generally the more blue the more expensive and this goes double for stat because of the rarity. The most expensive is a clear blue or ""sky blue"" followed by a blaze which is a mix of clear blue and crimson. After that is a gold and the least valuable being a steel gunmetal.   The next thing you might want to look at is quality and float value. The higher the float value the darker the colours will be. Personally I like a darker clear blue but you should figure out what you personally like before you spend money on one.   Last is pricing. Steel and gold mostly go for market price or close in all qualities. A blaze depending on the coverage can get upwards of 200 keys on a minimal (last time I saw a good one). Clear blue is by far the most expensive with the number 1 pattern on minimal going for 1300+ keys.   Now one warning, over market Ak CH usually take a long time to sell for close to their true value. So FIND ONE YOU LIKE since chances are you'll have it for a while. Good luck with whatever Ak you get!  wrote on mobile please forgive any spelling and formatting mistakes"
