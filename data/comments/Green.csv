Things that bring us more food, better health and  more comforts. our issue lies in that there are many unforseen, delayed costs (""externalities"") to modern technology. The human brain is not developed to consider such long term side effects, which is why we continue to make decisions and create technologies which treat the symptoms and neglect the root cause. There will be a point at which society will be very interested in cleaning water systems and preserving their environment, but that will only be once there is enough pollution and destruction to harm or inconvenience the people of means who currently drive society. I don't think the problem of the environment is one of total destruction, it's of increasing inequality. When the rich are inconvenienced, the poor are suffering terribly. We've spent the entirety of our existence trying to better ourselves, and I think it's time to view our society as a unit worth improving as a whole, since that's what has brought us this far .   Personally, I believe that's the reason we should have governing bodies. leadership that eschews common reasoning and studies, analyzes and deliberates with the goal of bettering the lives of everyone/the most people.

When I saw someone about to throw away a bunch of stuff, I would offer to help them sort their recycling, while explaining why we do it that way. I also did some research about waste mgmt in my city the psychology of recycling in general and used that to make a poster that I presented at a colleague meeting.
