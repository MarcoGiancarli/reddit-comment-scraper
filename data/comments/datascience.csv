I realized that the later exams were not valuable for what I wanted to do.  I started to go down MS route a few times, but abandoned each time because I was not learning shit.  It was a waste of time of money.  The only time it has ever hurt me was when applying for jobs -- once I made it through HR pre-screen it was never an issue.  That WAS 10 years ago.  The field has ballooned by now, so you'll have to make your own call.  If you do get your MS I would recommend doing it part-time and not leaving your full-time job."

datascience,3e3e75,idlecool,5,Tue Jul 21 17:28:02 2015 UTC,"This is a very long and in depth attempt to answer a question that doesn't actually exist in the real world. Statisticians aren't being left out of the data science revolution. It's just that the data science revolution is essentially a rapid expansion of things a subset of statisticians (and computer scientists) were already doing, along with a rebranding. There isn't a statistics program worth its salt these days that doesn't emphasize the computational parts of data science. And many of the ""data scientists"" I know considered themselves statisticians, and really only consider themselves data scientists because that's the buzzword these days. Their actual job responsibilities haven't change much, except in scope, which is the result of the amount of data produced today as well as the number of companies looking to hire them. The reason the author is struggling to find statisticians in the field of data science is because the line between the two fields isn't as demarcated as he/she thinks."

I also see some commentators suggested Open Intro book for Stat. It's a quite a good book however it too shuns Calculus. I too believe there is hardly any avoiding Calc. and Lin Alg. however some authors made the subject matter (Mathematical Stat) too obscure by introducing too many proofs and sacrifice intuition. Currently, I am referring to Mathematical Statistics with Applications (Tsokos) and Probability Statistics for Scientists and Engineers by Devore which are a little more accessible. But I am not sure if at all Mathematical Statistics (and all these proofs of the theories) will ever come to any use or not.

From there you can regress on 0-256 values.  edit: See Information Visualization chapter 4 for a ton on color mappings.

The field is known as spectroscopy. You'd then look at the salient features of the spectrum, like where the peaks are. See how those change.  A digital camera has got three kinds of sensors in it. If you shine a particular spectrum on a particular sensor, it will output a single number. Three sensors gives you three numbers (e.g. RGB values). That's way less information than the spectrum, which might be thousands of numbers, depending on how good your equipment is."
datascience,3do1jr,hugrate,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:16:44 2015 UTC,"I've had to deal with this kind of issue with GIS raster images. I think I can give you a better answer than use RGB or the color model.    1) What color frequencies are your instrument/sensor actually picking up? Unless you're picking up multiple frequencies of the 'same colors', you may only have to sample your data as a vector of those frequencies your instrument is actually detecting. (so usually as a 3D vector)  2) How many quantification bits for capturing light intensity (or energy)? Are the bits scaled exponentially like float point numbers, or are they incremental, representing a fix-range of intensity?  3) How much exposure time for capturing measurements?  These three questions are usually asked for transmitting data by imaging satellites from analog instruments as digital formats.  If your measurements are analog, you can force them to be standardized for a digital format via the above three questions. (i.e. only using set ranges of frequencies and intensities)    If your completely unsure of what frequencies to use for plotting, I would suggest creating a matrix for samples where each cell entry represents a range of frequencies (like 5 or 10 nm wavelength ranges, but do it across the entire visible spectrum) which contain intensity values (min or max or average for that range, if no range than just use zeros and ones), and each row entry is an averaged measurement for a certain time.   Perform PCA on this matrix and get two eigen vectors (possibly associated with the two largest eigen values, it depends. You should play around with the eigen vectors). The justification: each unique component of a substance has its own spectral signature and can only vary along the vector of that signature, so with enough samples PCA will reveal all spectral signatures via eigen vectors of the substance changing over time in composition.  With these two vectors, you can dot product any sample (where the sample is standardized as intensity values for frequency ranges as mentioned above) and plot them on an x and y axis (where one eigen vector is associated with the y axis and the other with the x). This plot can be created for each time step. Thus, compile and show them as an animation to display changes over time. Or time-label the changing points, showing connected points as a moving average. The dot product is basically a weighted sum of color intensities.  If you already know the crystal composition in terms of ranking of material rather than finite amounts, you can completely side step PCA and just dot product using the spectral signature of the major components, or most relevantly changing components of the crystals. Obviously you'd have to standardize the vector in a way mentioned above, but a lot less calculations on your part.  You can also make time the x axis and just plot each sample-vector-dot-product as its own time series.    Hope this helped. I know from having to do spectral and GIS work that 'a color model' is completely arbitrary and loses meaning in most rigorous physical and geographical contexts."

People do degree programs to get a network, to get a job. I'm doing a certification program now, but that's because I research full time and I need the skillset for that job, not to get a new one.    Data science is the kind of thing you learn best when you are applying it. You'll learn faster in the workplace and you'll have a well tailored skill set. You'll get a github repository that will mean magnitudes more than a line on your resume.   Don't worry about being soft on stats. All the information you need is on the internet, and you'll have to re-learn half of it anyway every time you are solving a new problem. I guess that's really what I'm trying to say. DS is about becoming a reliable, creative problem solver. You have to find answers in piles of things that usually haven't even been sorted for you before you start.

Web development and data science are both hot fields so it probably comes down to personal preference. If you're looking to be a web developer, I can't see the MSA program being more helpful than working full time as a developer.   If you want to be a data scientist then yes, the MSA program is going to get you there by providing the statistics background you lack while building on the programming skills you develop in the bootcamp.  Take into account your career goals as well. Would you rather work on the west coast or the east coast? The MSA program has a lot more relationships with east coast firms whereas your bootcamp likely has a lot more placement opportunities on the west coast. In five years, the MSA might bring your resume more respect than the bootcamp (especially if at any point you're considering going back for an MBA or PhD), but otherwise, employers really only care about your educational background when you're looking for your first job. After that, you rely on your professional work experience and portfolio to land your next job(s)."

I suggest starting with matplotlib since there are more resources for learning and it is more powerful, and then switch over to seaborn when you're making your presentation since seaborn looks alot nicer.

On one hand, you'll never get good at data science unless you actually try to work with data, do it all the time, and ask your own questions. On the other hand, it's just as important to be able to model small data sets well (stuff you can hold in memory) as it is to analyze large data sets (stuff you need spark or map reduce procedures for), and to model small data sets well you need to have mastered the model assumptions around common machine learning techniques and bayesian hierarchical modeling.

You mentioned that an imperfect solution is acceptable in a cloud environment since servers can be easily replaced. Have you considered biasing your clustering parameters in such a way that your detection system will increase false positives but reduce false negatives? It appears that your method defines an outlier as a server that does not fall within a cluster. How does your method deal with a cluster of outliers?

Maybe a data scientist will throw in an A/B test with some bootstrapped experiments but that's as complicated as the statistics get.  The people working on modified support vector regressions and tuning random forest classifiers are software engineers / AI people. So yes, it's pretty easy to switch into data science, especially if you have a PhD in an empirical science."
datascience,3d82h6,somkoala,3,Tue Jul 14 08:30:58 2015 UTC,If a data scientist can write ad hoc scripts they can also modify algorithms. You wouldn't put those algorithms into production but that's another discussion. I think your definition is quite strict for a position where nobody really knows what a data scientist is and ML / AI can also be part of their work.
datascience,3d82h6,alexgmcm,2,Tue Jul 14 12:13:14 2015 UTC,"Well at my work (I imagine we are one of the bigger players in data science - we have PB's of Data and like 50 Data Scientists who are completely separate from the data warehousing people) we do ML sometimes but it's uber basic compared to my Masters courses - like a random forest or something, not convnets.  The thing is most of it is to do with marketing or user prediction and most of the time there it is quite clear that you will have a linear model (because you are predicting long-term retention based on short-term retention or something) and if you do more complex stuff then often you are just modelling noise.  But most of the work is writing reports, not models - because the Data Science department just gets contacted by every other department and asked to look at various things so you go to loads of meetings and pump out queries, graphs and slides and then sometimes there is cool modelling work.  Being amazing at SQL/R/Python and understanding HDFS/MapReduce/Spark etc. is far more important than knowing the intricacies of tuning a neural network or how to design the best SVM etc.  I like the work though - declarative programming is always challenging and even more so when you are using truly huge data sets (literally billions of records) and have to really consider join efficiency and trying to query on the partition variables in HDFS."
datascience,3d82h6,somkoala,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:30:00 2015 UTC,"I would agree that being able to process the data is more important than the models, but that's also because 60-80% of data scientist's work is spent cleaning data, which you have to do regardless of whether you are doing a methodologically simple analysis or advanced machine learning. Most of my time is spent writing reports / coming up with simple insights rather than sophisticated ML. Also finding (aggregating/cleansing) the right features is often much more effective than tuning the model. I work at a smaller company, so as the team would grow you'd get more and more specialization in terms of tools and tasks, but I am not sure that is the case with most companies."
datascience,3d82h6,alexgmcm,2,Tue Jul 14 18:07:13 2015 UTC,"My company has a separate team for data cleaning etc. - which I LOVE!!!!! Because my masters project was a nightmare of cleaning 20 year old data pulled from magnetic tape that was full of corruptions that would freeze my whole machine so I had to use awk and sed etc. to clean it as my advisor was adamant we interpolate over the corruptions even though it fucked with the DSP so much we had to get rid of it in the end anyway... ughhh...  I really like the data engineering role even though I come from Physics/Comp. Neurosci. so I don't know that much software engineering - but those guys make some really cool shit and get to learn how to set up the HDFS etc.  It's weird being at such a massive firm as like you say it does mean we are really specialised - we get the cutting edge tools and hardware to do our work, but we lack that sort of jack of all trades experience I suppose."
datascience,3d82h6,somkoala,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:18:09 2015 UTC,"In my company we are just at a point where we are going to separate the data scientists and data analyst team, so it is a long way to go from there until we would have a separate data cleaning team. It is hard to judge what the ideal model is. On one hand more specialization is better since you can focus on the things you enjoy doing / are better at, on the other hand, unless the data cleaning was generic and standardized I can't imagine not having a feel of how dirty the data was and what I've had to do to clean it in order to make conclusions out of it. Again I might not be able to imagine it because I simply haven't experienced it."
datascience,3d82h6,alexgmcm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:28:10 2015 UTC,Well our data is generated by Java or objective c events in the games so in that sense it is clean as opposed to when I was reading MEG data from hospital sensors so really they handle the daily massive ETL jobs and transforming it from event data to semantic data (but we still have access to the event data)   The semantic data is better because it has commonly needed derived fields there for you already and combines many of the separate event tables that just mean the same thing   What is data analysts? Is that just using qlikview and excel?
datascience,3d82h6,somkoala,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:12:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, data analysts use excel and different reporting tools and dashboards."

datascience,3d82h6,WallyMetropolis,2,Wed Jul 15 00:31:17 2015 UTC,"Not just those things, but also a familiarity with a business domain. A data scientist is fundamentally not a junior position."
datascience,3d82h6,jackmaney,2,Tue Jul 14 14:59:16 2015 UTC,"Because there's no real consensus on what a Data Scientist is. A couple of years ago, I was switched and baited into a ""Data Scientist"" position that consisted of prettying up reports in QlikView (a beefier version of Excel--and much, much more annoying to use, if you can believe it).  Unfortunately, your answer to ""what does someone in Profession X do on a daily basis (in detail)?"" will vary about as much as the folks whom you ask. Without going into inappropriate levels of detail, right now, I'm working on an exploratory analysis project and am also working on a separate R&D project. I write Python and use quite a bit of SQL."

I feel that ""junior data scientists"" can get by with very limited ""depth"" but still need some basic familiarity with the subjects you mentioned and an ability to understand the business domain. As other have replied, the definition of data scientist is still unclear for most people, including the ones hiring for such positions.   This confusion causes the day-to-day work to be very much dependent on the skill-set of the individual, and the flexibility of the position. We have people doing more simple BI reporting type analyses, and have people writing advanced variational bayes models to improve the quality of our models."

But again excel is pretty much where my knowledge of data science begins and ends.  2) I didn't fuck anyone. They know about my background, but perhaps they've underestimated my work as an assistant researcher (mostly edited writing and reviewed monographs). I realize what a long shot it is for me to EXCEL in this position. The interview can end in 5 minutes, I could be hired and be out of a job again in two weeks, or maybe I might stumble into a career of data science for the next 15 years.  I don't know. I can't think that far. I just saw an opportunity and I'm trying to capitalize on it. And I was hoping I could come to the veterans here for a little help.

datascience,3d0pbc,maxToTheJ,22,Sun Jul 12 15:50:59 2015 UTC,"reddit is no different than quora and datascience101 and in some ways has a better format for asking questions. CS has /r/learnprogramming for instance or /r/cscareerquestions but they work only because they have hundreds of thousands of readers/subscribers.   Compare that to /r/datascience which has only 9,000 subscribers, and a far less active community. So a /r/askdatascientist wouldn't work because it would have no active user base.   I guess if you don't like the questions, just ignore them/hide them. There's really no harm being done, and there's no where else for them to go."

How hard is it to not participate in discussions you aren't interested in? Do you really feel compelled to force other people to stop having those discussions because they don't interest you? Is it hard for you to find non-career posts just because there happen to be sometimes several of them a day at the most?  The reason career questions have and always will persist in any forum about this field is because it is a huge umbrella term for a new field, and advice on where to start and where you can go with data science entirely depends on your education, experience, interests, pre-existing skill-set, etc.  It is totally, completely logical for somebody to say ""I know there's a ton of knowledge on data science tools out there and things a 'data scientist should know', but here's my experience and interests, how should I approach the field?"" is an entirely fair question to ask that will not be answered by a wiki. The details matter in getting quality advice, and there's no reason that this can't be a place where people can get quality advice tailored to specific details of their skills, experience, and aspirations.  Drop the elitism and stop trying to stifle discussion that people are obviously interested in having on this forum."

You can't make a Wiki to answer questions that rely on those specifics as relevant factors.

datascience,3d0jws,jackdoesketo,0,Sun Jul 12 14:40:19 2015 UTC,"1) Easier = Less pay. I think this is untrue - for example, if you go work your ass off doing monkeys work in finance (excel models and doing powerpoint decks for 50-70 hours a week) the rewards are I believe are the highest out of any industry if you work at a top firm - if this wasn't so why would so many people from top tier universities still be working in finance?  2) I think it is a lot easier to determine if you prefer web development or data science than you give credit for. If you don't at least test the water you could set yourself up for failure soon in your career from burn-out/mid life crisis.  3) I don't get why you'd mention that you certainly won't get rich from doing IT, people have before and it the point doesn't matter anyway. What about the explosion in tools to automate the data science process?

Yes, doctors can make $$$, and average is like $200,000 as you mentioned in high COL areas, but a good data scientist with about 5–10 years of experience could hit $150,000+ I think.

You cant just conclude bias because the rate is smaller.   What do the distributions of the MCAT and GRE scores of the applicants look like for the different groups? Are they really gaussian so that an avg is a reasonable descriptor of the distribution? Is it bimodal? If so what is the distance between the modes?   It also seems to be the case that it is easier to get into a “big-name” company like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Tesla, etc. as a Data Scientist rather than as a web developer.    This is simply not true. There are enough STEM PhDs with machine learning experience for them to have PhDs working on Ad analytics. Those same people are also very interested in working for those top companies because of how academia is setup. Startups are more likely to take a chance if you come cheap and they have someone to onboard you."

The structure of the assignments thus results in a gratifying amount of payoff for a small amount of work. You don’t need to be fluent in python–far from it–in order to complete the labs, and can likely pick up what you need along the way if you have experience in some other programming language.  I did find the labs to be much more time-consuming than the course estimates, partly because:  Error tracebacks in Spark tend to hit you like a great wall of angry text, and are hard to parse (to the uninitiated, at least). I was more hesitant to experiment/test freely in the IPython Notebooks out of a fear that some unsanctioned code would cause problems with the tetchy lab Autograder. However, it never did freeze on me, although it did for others who were too liberal in their use of collect() statements. The instructors were extremely responsive to student questions and nimble to implement improvements in real-time. I’m sure the course will continue to improve over the next iterations."

I do happily work on smaller projects that use already-processed data, however.      I use Linux, and I don't honestly know if there are any advantages to using a Macbook over a Linux machine. Linux (Ubuntu in particular) is super nice because of how easy it is to set up a workable development environment (way easier than on Mac).

If overall ease of usage  with ""just works"" is desired then better to for Mac. Mac is also good in most other aspects as described above. The only caveat is costs more. With a non-gaming laptop, less desire to spend money and if one wants a better of both worlds ( 1 and 2 above, may not be quite as good as Mac) then Windows dual booted with Ubunutu/MintLinux is good. The caveat, who ever buys it must be willing to do some tinkering if needed.Also, before buying the laptop one needs to check that the specific model has most of the stuff working.

You'll end up paying a premium for any of those because they're certified for X Y or Z CAD package, whereas you can get a gaming laptop with 2x the specs for the same price. My last laptop was a monstrous Lenovo W700, and I never really felt it was powered enough - my new one is an Alienware M18 gaming machine, and it cuts through anything like butter.  I'd also suggest going for CPU speed over cores if you're working with python, unless you have some specific parallel uses already established. My laptop is overclocked to 4GHz with quad cores, and my desktop is a dual Xeon 2.8GHz hexcore, and the laptop still wins out on any single threaded tasks by a large margin. And to address the *portable bit above - I don't consider this laptop to be portable, it's more of a workstation that I was allowed to leave the office with!  And of course, get a fast PCIe SSD if you can, if not then definitely SATA SSD and make sure the controller is 6GB/s. Some PCIe SSD speeds up to to 2000MB/s now!

To your question, ""How could he use this experience to his advantage"" - the fact that the person knows how the business works, what are the business needs, what are not the business needs, and all the nitty gritty of the job - then allows this person to ask the right question. It also allows the person to know what kind of results are required - i.e. do we care about directionality correct answers, or are we in a case where improving algorithm accuracy by 1% will give us millions/billions of dollars, in which case serious resources should be spend getting that 1% edge.  It also allows the person to have a nuanced point of view on things which is always always always surprisingly more helpful than someone who picked up the subject last week.  To your question, ""What should he avoid?"", - the fact that the person is coming from the business side rather than the hard science academic masters/phd route, means that they will be weak in the ""math & stats"" part of the data science work.

Try to learn about data collection by strengthening your marketing data. You could download the Tableau Public version and play around with publicly available datasets. Take a Coursera class, they've got an entire data science class. Find a mentor or shadow people who are working with data more often.  Learn how to present data by being smarter about how you communicate. There are plenty of podcasts out there about data science and don't forget about just simply Googling shit you're interested in.

Regardless, since you have clusters of elements now, you can just run standard statistical analysis on each cluster. You can find which cluster is correlated to which feature by running chi-square/t-tests for each feature for each cluster. Alternatively, you can find which variables have the highest variance across all clusters by performing chi-square/anova/kruskal-wallis across all of the clusters simultaneously for each feature."

datascience,3cpnfr,pndur,12,Fri Jul 10 01:18:08 2015 UTC,"IMO the best way to learn SQL/python/pandas at the same time. Is to install SQL Server express on your local box, Add Adventure works DB to the server.  use Ipython notebook then connect to the Server with pyodbc and query the data into a pandas dataframe and then manipulate the pandas dataframe to do simple transformation and aggregation on the Data. ALSO do the transforms directly in the sql script to so you learn how to do it in both SQL and PANDAS.  Then use matplotlib to graph the data. AND BAM you have a good enough skillset to do exploratory data analysis with SQL/Pandas/Matplotlib.  Now if you want to do more complex sql stuff like temp tables/stored proc's/etc then I'd install SSMS and use that. I feel Python/PYODBC is not really ideal for using sql like that."

If that is the case, hands down, in my opinion, you should learn relational first.

You're going to get bogged down with a lot of random public health stuff not even remotely related to your end goal. If you are going to be learning a stats package don't waste your time with STATA (or SPSS). R is probably your best bet data science wise (out of the ones you listed, I'd highly recommend learning python as well if you are serious about data science), but I can't really knock SAS.

datascience,3cppjk,DrLionelRaymond,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:20:38 2015 UTC,"A couple of different things going on here so I'll try to address them one by one.    I am actually more interested in epidemiology and health intervention efficency, international work, even policy, so I'm thinking of ""data science"" as more of a backup.    Practically speaking, these two things are wildly different. Data science is going to be very heavy (almost exclusively) on pure statistics, calculus, linear algebra, programming, etc. The international/policy work and intervention evalution stuff is going to pull you in a very different, much more ""high-level, big-picture"" direction. Granted, being at a place like Hopkins you're much more likely to encounter big-picture people who are also very capable at stats and/or programming, but the emphasis on these skills will almost certainly be minimized.   Though I have certainly heard the idea that it's easier to go from biostats to epidemiology than the other way around..   Having worked both in academia and industy, I can say that this has definitely been my experience. MPH's in general tend to be dismissed much more quickly than MS's in biostats (even if the person took a biostats track during his or her MPH). Many with a quant/physics/math background see an MPH as more of a social sciences degree. I often chalk that up to them just not understanding what an MPH really entails.    I still often wonder if biostats is a better route, however..   My $0.02 (which is an optimistic valuation), if you are really interested in the epi stuff, but want to do evalution research AND not close any doors for yourself regarding data science, I think you would be best served getting a biostats degree and looking to get a certificate in policy, intervention evaluation, etc. I'm not too familiar with the options available at Hopkins, but I can't imagine they would be very limited.    It looks like you have a graduate degree in biostatistics. Would you mind telling about your background a bit?   Sure. Will PM."

The coding, visualizations, algorithms can be learned as you go. understanding the dataset, be able to identify patterns and able to formulate a solution is what a data scientist does every day (at least for me). For e.g. majority of my day goes into data munging where I use Pandas and scikit to sample and identify patterns. I then ask questions (from product mgmt point of view) and then identify what algos to run on the datasets. Often times (especially early days) I am biased towards the solution I want (overfitting). So be wary about that.  One other thing, most people are attracted to data science (probably because of the rage) but it is a tough field because the success of the job is heavily dependent on how good is the dataset. So be paranoid (or use Bayes :)  Hopefully one day, all datasets will be tidy and correct and we can consume without the ETL hellhole."

If you are just trying to expand your skill set in the Big Data environment in general, and not Hadoop necessarily, maybe you should try Spark.  Edx: Introduction to Big Data with Apache Spark    Edx: Scalable Machine Learning  Anyway, the videos in the Udacity course are a good introduction to Big Data in general, either you do the practical parts or not.  The practical parts on the Edx courses are very good as a starting point on Spark and as today I didn't find any other courses on Spark with a learning curve so soft.  Edit: as /u/dman87 points out, you can also use R with Hadoop streaming, but as he says I don't think R is the ideal language for this task. I'd prefer python (because I know it) or java.

I took a few CS classes- through Software Development Methods, all in Java, so I'm finding learning Hadoop (via that Udacity course and Hadoop: The Definitive Guide) to be productive.  I feel like there's a chicken and the egg problem with it comes to gaining experience in Hadoop. There isn't any way to use Hadoop in my work, so I can't apply it to my current job- although I want to demonstrate knowledge and experience in distributed computing.   I know the alternative is to just find large amounts of data, write programs using the Hadoop ecosystem, put them on Github, and say ""see!"", but I feel like getting my Cloudera Certified Hadoop Developer certificate could bolster my CS street cred and show that I've done more learning than required to simply write a couple of programs.

I'd rather use my time to specialize in different things or get dirty with the data/program I'm actually working on and learn more. And if you ask me, I'd prefer to have nice uploads on github, rather than have a certification on my Linkedin.

datascience,3cgka9,dman87,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:55:30 2015 UTC,"That's a big question! There are a lot of options.   About 2 years ago, I started learning Hadoop. But, I learned it the hard way. I already had linux and java experience.   I just started doing things. I looked at code examples to figure out how they worked. But, it's important to understand the basics of the underlying architecture.   You can use R in Hadoop streaming, but not ""natively."" It is, in my opinion, more difficult and offers less performance than native Java Hadoop applications.  The Hadoop ecosystem is very large. You need to do some research and define exactly what you want to learn first. Identify tasks that you want to be able to accomplish with Hadoop. Then, figure out which tools can help you to accomplish that. Finally, figure out how you can write code that interacts with those tools.  I do a lot of Hadoop development making MapReduce programs. I even manage our test Hadoop machines at the office and teach lab sessions on Hadoop at the graduate level at my university.   Don't expect that you can just take a course and really understand how to best utilize it--you won't. You need to get your hands dirty!  If you don't have the prerequisites for some of these courses, that is telling you something. You lack the supporting knowledge to really dive into Hadoop. You need to understand those things before you can really get started in Hadoop."
datascience,3cgka9,der_luke,2,Tue Jul 7 19:22:21 2015 UTC,"Hadoop, as in map-reduce jobs written in java are pretty much outdated by spark these days. And since spark 1.4 there even is an R API for it. So my suggestion to OP would be: download spark, (on windows the easiest thing might be to try a virtual machine image, e. g. from cloudera) and have a go at that. Excellent machine learning tools readily available and you can start right away in R, although I would recommend the scala API.  So go for spark, it probably 'counts' as hadoop these days anyway, the rest of what ppl usually expect is for you to know hive, or impala which is basically SQL. Also playing around with linux will definitely help."
datascience,3cgka9,dman87,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:31:36 2015 UTC,"Hadoop, as in map-reduce jobs written in java are pretty much outdated by spark these days   That is simply not true. This is only the case where your data volumes are such that they can fit into RAM. At work, we process data that far exceeds what you can place into RAM. Spark is ideal for systems where performance is key or response time (latency) is very important.   To say that Spark has pretty much outdated MapReduce is not true across the board. There are data loads that cannot be done with Spark without very expensive hardware. This leads to another issue: cost. In the purely academic world with no cost consideration, sure you can say that it is possible. But, in industry, that is not practical nor is it possible when you have to consider a budget. My company couldn't purchase the hardware to do what we do on Spark.  Spark does count as Hadoop--it absolutely does (at least, in my book). It shares a lot of the underlying infrastructure and requires some of the same Hadoop services. This is why I said he really neds to define what he wants to do with Hadoop first. It makes a world of difference."

Most of this stuff comes from Doctoral research and I don't have the time to explain even the core stuff at the moment--I shouldn't even be on Reddit lol. Trying to bring our algorithms to MapReduce was like fitting a square peg in a round whole. Though, we are targeting Spark for certain applications where the limitations don't apply or we're forced to make compromises in order to reduce latency.  We are not doing your typical Data Science work though. So, maybe we're an outlier. We also target the lowest cost hardware when possible. This means fewer machines and definitely less memory than your typical Hadoop cluster."

Or DS engineers who specialize in building out systems.  The reason why you want DS who specialize in, say, engineering is so that data isn't misused downstream in some product.  They need to understand the nuance of the output - for example, if I'm making cost predictions for the purpose of ranking members based on risk then I definitely do not want my predictions to be used somewhere downstream as a forecast of cost (and I assure you these types of things will happen because to the untrained, a prediction is a prediction)."

Anyway, this was partially motivated by the fact that I couldn't find any good word2vec tutorials/explanations/demonstrations for those with no background in NLP, and it seems like most word2vec tutorials only talk about how to implement a model using modules/packages/libraries and how they behave rather than how the algorithm works.

Soccer players aren't getting taller even though one would think it would help them head the ball...  The interesting thing here is that there is a quantifiable correlation and that we are apparently seeing the average height of pro tennis players increasing over time.  An important part of data science is supporting ideas with data rather than assuming the obvious. Indeed, while the height difference between the average of the top 10 players and the average of the top 100 is notable, the effect is clearly far from the most important factor, the variance is large. It's interesting to get an idea of how important height is from this data.  The 4th round Wimbledon Murray vs. Karlovic match yesterday was a perfect demonstration of how a skilled player can defeat one almost a foot taller than himself; makes me wonder whether the only practical advantage afforded by height is serve speed (and maybe high smashes, though most smashes are unreturnable regardless)."

Soccer:  again, more size without sacrificing speed.

At a lot of startups and companies in smaller markets (where it's hard to find good developers), the main problem the business has is there aren't enough developers. In a large company, there's a lot of developer support: a DBA spins up new machines and installs new software (and optimizes databases) for developers, a business analyst meets with management and writes detailed requirements so developers don't sit in meetings all day, a project manager tracks the work they do and deals with the effect changing requirements has on deadlines, etc. If the typical data analyst roles have been taken care of (ETLs all written and run smoothly for data coming in, reports automatically generated, the database model is logical and everything runs fast) you may find yourself filling a support role.    Unit testing is good practice for a data analyst- especially if you didn't do any scripting in the last 9 months (were you really manually downloading data, manually cleaning it up, and manually loading it into a database?) it will help you start to develop your programming skills.

datascience,3c7ltu,EatingCake,4,Sun Jul 5 19:15:44 2015 UTC,"Statistics is basically the core of Data Science (though it touches some other disciplines too like Information Technology and Database Management). But to progress in this field, first get the basics of core Statistics:  Statistics   Measures of central tendencies: Mean, Median, Mode, etc. Nowadays, many tools are available like Matlab and Libreoffice that does this work for you. These measures help you in estimation. Probability and Sampling: These are some basic tools and their application varies everywhere from stock markets to the NASA space shuttles. Probability is a method of finding the likelihood of a certain event happening and Sampling involves the estimation of a larger population subject, based on smaller samples of it. Correlation and Regression: As a data-analyst, one of your task is about making sense of your big data, and correlation and regression are going to be helpful here. Correlation is about judging the statistical relationship between two sets of data. Examples: the relationship between sales and stock prices, salary hikes and performance, rainfall and grain output, etc. Correlation itself doesn't imply a dependency or causal relation between the variables, however, its just a statistical relationship. Regression is the prediction of data based on established correlation.   Information  Technology   Databases: Once you have studied basic statistics, you are ready to apply that knowledge in the field on Information Technology and Data Science is just another magical phrase given to this simple application of knowledge! Learning the basics of how tables, primary and foreign keys, etc. work will complement your knowledge of statistics by providing you a way to model your analyses. Crawlers and Scrapers: Of course, Statistical tools like correlation and regression needs data. As a Data Analyst, where are you going get your data from? Until the so-called semantic-web integrates into the real world (could take at least a few decades), our only way of fetching data is through HTML crawlers and scrapers. Crawlers and scrapers act as data sources for Google, Yahoo and a multitude of other Data oriented companies."

So if your data set is 9 columns and 50k rows, it should be easily importable into excel.  Then what you can do is use excel formulas to add split up the data in the arrays.  For instance, if (in new sheet, new tab), I put in the following:  A1 => =""['20 likes','35 likes']""  B1 => =SUBSTITUTE(A1,"","","""")  C1 => =LEN(A1)  D1 => =LEN(B1)  E1 => =C1-D1  F1 => =FIND("","",A1)  G1 => =LEFT(A1,F1)  H1 => =RIGHT(A1,LEN(A1)-F1)  where  A1 -> original string  B1 -> take out all of the commas in the original string  C1 -> get the length of the original string  D1 -> get the length of the original string without commas  E1 -> Difference tells you the number of commas found in the original string  F1 -> Find the first comma in the original string  G1 -> Get the text that is up to the first comma  H1 -> Get the rest of the text  Obviously, you can clean up the G1 to remove brackets, single quotes, etc...  What you now have is the data split up.  Note, you can do pretty much the same thing with any other scripting language and maybe even easier .  In google spreadsheets, you can go up to 2 million cells. 50,000 * 9 rows => 450,000 cells, so you could even do this in google spreadsheets. :)  Good luck!"

datascience,3by2u7,steelypip,2,Fri Jul 3 04:46:23 2015 UTC,"Object oriented programming is useful in some cases but has a tendency to be massively overused, especially by those who first learnt languages such as Java or C# where it is the only paradigm available.  For many programming problems a functional programming style is more appropriate, or a combination of FP and OOP.  My personal rule is that if something doesn't have mutable state then it should probably not be modelled as a class, and inheritance should only be used as a last resort.  The sort of programming you describe where data is passed around and fed through pipelines for various transformations is common to data science and IMHO is not suited to a lot of OOP.

datascience,3by2u7,kevjohnson,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:37:28 2015 UTC,"It entirely depends on the context.  Generally if you're working for a large organization then it's better to spend the time to make your code more modular so it can play nicer with other pieces of software and be reusable for future projects.    Having a function that takes in an arbitrary dataset and does some common task is very useful to have and it would be unfortunate if it was buried in the middle of a giant script.  I do research so most of my work is done in scripts (though not all of it), but right now I'm working at a large organization and I'm focusing a lot more on making my overall system modular and my functions as general as possible in order to maximize the value of the code after I'm gone in a month."
datascience,3by2u7,kevjohnson,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:00:43 2015 UTC,But how would making your function a class help? Either way its takes something in and spits it out. Maybe the class would have a bunch of methods that help convert a number of data formats into a single kind?
datascience,3by2u7,featherfooted,3,Fri Jul 3 04:08:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah something along those lines.  Again it depends a lot on the context of what you're doing and what the rest of the organization is doing.  I have a separate module that I use for any function that I think could be useful outside of my project (several modules actually) and I make sure they have pristine documentation.  As far as object-oriented code specifically, I actually don't see all that much use for it in most data science applications, but maybe I just haven't worked on projects that need it.  Python in general can be a bit ambiguous on when you should use object-oriented programming.  One example is I have an I/O class that contains methods for reading and writing that are specific to our organization.  That's the kind of thing that everybody can use by just importing that instead of something like the csv library and people can add onto it over time.  There's also a lot of unnecessary OO programming out there as well.  Sometimes I'll just make an entire project one big class with a bunch of subclasses and so on for no real reason other than it's more interesting to switch it up."

datascience,3bsn4g,Mcmarlboro,3,Wed Jul 1 20:40:06 2015 UTC,Solving all those data analysis questions just require a little bit of creativity. Everything else is just knowing how to use Machine Learning algorithms.   Good news. All three of those questions are classification questions.  What I would do is just figure out how classification algorithms work in Machine Learning and guess which features you think may be relevant for each question.

All you'll need to do is select which features (whether to use customer IDs, orders, etc..) to use. I'm not too experienced in scalability, but since you have about 100,000 accounts, you might need to use something like Apache Spark for Python or something."

As a follow up question, (apologies if this comes off as dumb) would you mind telling me how you were able to categorize these as ""classification questions""? Is there some literature that talks about this that you would recommend for a complete noob , or is this simply something that you pick up from experience?"
datascience,3bsn4g,MusicIsLife1995,2,Thu Jul 2 20:10:36 2015 UTC,A problem is a classification problem if there exists a finite number of possible outputs.   Will a particular domain name/hosting package be renewed? ~ outputs: either renewed or not renewed  Which customers should we target for up-selling? ~ outputs:target for up-selling or don't target for up-selling  Which customers are likely to renew products that they bought at a discount? ~outputs: likely to renew or not likely to renew  A regression problem has a continuous output. Example: Predicting the price of a house given its surface area.

datascience,3bsn4g,MusicIsLife1995,2,Fri Jul 3 07:02:22 2015 UTC,"Classification. Regression problems generally have infinite continuous ranges.  I'll show you why. Logistic regression, returns a prediction of either true or false. Where true = 1 and false = 0. The fact, however, is that most predictions are actually between 0 and 1 (1 being 100%). Most people using logistic regression will round the probabilities. So if I get a probability of .8 back, it will round to 1 and be set as true. Vice versa if I got .3 back it would round to 0.  You can decide whether to round or not programmatically. In your case, however, you're going to be dealing with millions of data! So instead of rounding up and down, perhaps return 1 (true) if a value has a probability of say .9 (so 10% error) and return 0 (false) otherwise."

datascience,3bpzjf,Reiziger,2,Wed Jul 1 14:34:17 2015 UTC,"Here's a story from the other side of the fence. I work for a startup founded and run by MBA's, where corporate culture (even though we're small, and most employees are engineers) has permeated everything - from manager/employee relations, to unreasonable metrics, such as expectation to achieve 99.5% accuracy on predicting a rare event (minority class). As the only Data Scientist, I sit on the product team, populated and run by corporatey types, who have built a detection engine based solely on logic/rules and explicit weightings. I myself am tasked by management with producing ML models to ""beat"" this engine, that should, in essence, make my colleagues and boss look bad. Thus, I am always faced with hurdles, especially when something I need has to make it into a dev team sprint - my boss always de-prioritizes my requirements in management meetings. The only reason I'm able to do my job is because the VP of Engineering has realized that the current approach is not scalable, and has supported me. Finally, I've produced and released a model into production that does quite a bit better than the rules-based system. Instead of being glad we have a more powerful tool at our disposal, my boss has instructed me to manually review all 15K decisions produced by the model (thus far, on 200+ variables), in order to prove out what the differences between the two systems' decisions are - so he can tweak the weightings in the first system some more. Would leave from here in a heart beat, but am on a work permit sponsored by them, so am stuck.  EDIT: The model, although having a higher accuracy, is, of course, no good to my boss, as it ""rejects too many transactions"". Was also told that I ""seriously need to start earning my salary""."

datascience,3boymt,normee,2,Wed Jul 1 18:08:28 2015 UTC,"What do you mean ""which sample rate"" is correct? What are you trying to do? I think what you're observing may be that the sampling variability of the mean is lower than an individual observation. By aggregating over larger units of time, you're smoothing out variation that you may or may not actually care about.  Consider a simple process where you're measuring something each second whose true value is zero and doesn't actually change, but your tool gives random independent N(0,1) errors in your readings. When you take the average of your readings over each minute, those minute-level mean readings are now distributed like N(0,1/60), so your sample variance at the minute level is much lower than at the second level. Take averages at the hourly level, and now your mean hourly readings are distributed as N(0,1/3600), etc."

I waltzed right into this internship after a 30 minute interview at a bar where the most technical question I got was what text editor I preferred to use, but that's mostly because I have several years of experience doing analytics in healthcare.  Healthcare providers don't tend to recruit data scientists very much because they don't know that they need them.  We're just now getting up and running with every provider using electronic medical records, the industry is really far behind when it comes to technology.  Few hospitals are set up to handle the amount of data that a data scientist would want.  Anyway, the point is that it exists, but there's not a ton of recruiting going on.

If they can't, ask them for their internship placement info and what the range of pay is for those. I'd also recommend talking to recent graduates from all three programs that are placed in positions that you might like and get their perspective.  My bias would be to get a CS or Stats degree and create your own cognate but as poopyheadthrowaway stated, ""it depends on the program and connections."""

datascience,3bhqqi,FulyenCurtz,3,Mon Jun 29 18:39:19 2015 UTC,I went through the inaugural Data Science for Social Good internship at Georgia Tech last summer if anybody has any questions about that.  I worked on a project with the Atlanta Police about how dispatcher workload affects dispatch time (tl;dr: it has a pretty big impact).  I also helped set up a project for this summer involving a local educational gardening non-profit that my friend works at.  There's a lot of really cool stuff going on if you want to get involved.  If you're not a student then these types of programs are always looking for more professional mentors.  At the moment it's only available in Chicago and Atlanta but you could get with your local university and start a new program in your city.

datascience,3bhqqi,bendy_straw_ftw,3,Tue Jun 30 06:06:02 2015 UTC,"Somebody else linked the Chicago version, but here is the Atlanta version.  My undergrad is in Industrial Engineering and at the time I was about to start a PhD in Computational Science and Engineering.  I also had a couple years of experience doing analytics research going into it.   Most people in the program came from a CS background but some (like me) came from a more statistics background and there were a few humanities people as well.  From what I remember more than half of us were in grad school (either MS or PhD).  To start the program you spend a week or so learning about the various projects that are available.  Usually somebody from the organization comes and talks to the group.  Then you rank your preferences for a project and the coordinator assigns the groups based on that.  In my year everybody got their first or second choice.  Each group is 4-5 students and you work for the entire summer on whatever project you are assigned to.  Each project gets a mentor (usually a professor or sometimes an industry person) and you typically have weekly meetings with the organization and site visits if necessary.  At the end we presented our projects at the Atlanta Data Science Meetup group.  Hundreds of people attended which was pretty surprising.  A few of them tried to recruit me away from doing a PhD but I told them to shove it :)  You can get an idea of what projects are available from here."

datascience,3bk2yi,FulyenCurtz,2,Tue Jun 30 06:07:11 2015 UTC,"The problem with using ""he"" and ""her"", is that those words can refer to many different people (maybe, I don't know your data), which would introduce biases into your network. For the network to work, there needs to be some assumptions or knowledge about the structure of the data.  For example, if I knew beforehand that there were only 20 unique people in all of my data, you could simply count the number of sentences that two names, separated by some text, appear together.  For example, given a sentence such as ""Lisa works with Greg"", you can have your code look for the pattern ""Lisa"" ""some text"" ""Greg"". Or more generally ""Any name"" ""some text"" ""Any name"".   The approach above is rather simple, and completely ignores sentence structure. But it could work for your data."
datascience,3bk2yi,FulyenCurtz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:37:04 2015 UTC,"Most of my data is actually policy documents that explicitly states the actor; I could manually enter the cases where the actor is implicit.  Your suggestion works very well.  I'm a researcher, not a programmer, so I'm sorry if the question is very basic, but it's possible to create a little programme to code instances of ""Lisa"" ""some text"" ""Greg""?

datascience,3bejqb,vmsmith,3,Mon Jun 29 23:44:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I've been affiliated with a top-notch research laboratory on and off since 1987. At one point I was a sponsor. Later, a computer scientist on the staff. Later still, a technical support contractor.   That lab is populated with real scientists who do serious research and add to the body of knowledge in their chosen fields. And that is how I have come to think of the term 'science.'  This term 'data science' can, in fact, reflect real scientific advancement in the several fields associated with data analytics, such as math and statistics. And I am sure there are people currently operating at the level of the late John Tukey who can be considered 'Data Scientists.'  But take a look around at how the terms are commonly used. There's a guy at one of the local Meetups I attend who has an undergraduate degree in graphic design or something, and who somehow landed a job doing Pivot Tables and such in Excel for a non-profit. And his job title is 'Data Scientist.'  That is, admittedly, probably an extreme example. But just look at how many places like Coursera and Data Camp and the like are willing to bestow certificates with the term 'Data Science' on anybody who pays the small fee and makes it through the multiple-attempts-allowed multiple choice quizzes.  In short, I find the terms to be vague and pretentious, and I am immediately suspicious of people who describe themselves as 'Data Scientists,' or their work as 'Data Science.'  Take a look at Gartner's 2014 Hype Cycle. I predict we have another year or so of people scrambling to figure out ways to buy or sell 'data science,' and then reality will finally set in and a lot of dreams will be dashed."

Not sure if your program would cover this but econometrics is the very formal, economics approach to causal inference. Because you typically cant run experiments on things like economies, job markets, etc. much of economic inference is observational, so they have developed careful tools for doing observational studies. Learning to identify things like natural experiments, regression discontinuities, etc is a great tool for data science.  Microeconomics/game theory. As a data scientist, you will probably at some point build a system (or take data from a system) that interacts with selfish agents (i.e. humans) and they might not act in the way that your system thought they would. Game theory (and microeconomics more generally) is a formal way to think about how people will respond to the incentives created by your system. I wouldn't say its directly useful but I think its a nice mindset to have."

datascience,3bcsmp,sleepicat,4,Sun Jun 28 02:34:53 2015 UTC,"I say this as someone who has >10 years experience with SAS and who makes a living as a SAS programmer (all of my stats professors either preferred R or required it for their classes, I got better at R when I started wanting decent looking graphs and better still when I started using Notepad++ and NPPtoR so I could create stats-related graphics when I was teaching undergrad stats).   Learn R. Because of its large corporate clients, SAS is so focused on being backwards compatible to what they originally in the 70s that their parser, their logic, etc. is...antiquated (don't get me started on why you can't trust that %put &parameter is actually what SAS' parser is interpreting that &parameter to be).   Each SAS procedure seems almost proud of using slightly different syntax from all of the other procedures. SAS is such a monolith that they are years behind implementing anything close to what R offers. The only reason SAS is still holding on is because it offers itself free/low-cost TO ACADEMIC ENVIRONMENTS. If you want to continue learning/practicing SAS on your personal computer after graduation? A SAS license is several thousand dollars per year.  If you want to do data science, you'll go farther with R than with SAS (SAS will just teach you bad coding/logic habits.) Case in point: SQL is an foundational skill for data-science, and SAS is still stuck on a shitty implementation of the ANSI ~'92 standard. Because NOTHING important has happened in databases since 1992. They supposedly have a federated-SQL procedure in the new version of SAS, but once SAS implements a new procedure, it takes a couple of new SAS releases before the procedure's bugs are fixed enough to be usable.  If you look at job listings, R is making rapid gains on SAS and SPSS. Assuming you're still in undergrad, then by the time you graduate, R will have gained even more market-share in job listings/job hype.   And the ""enterprise"" (business) version of R (Revolution R) was just acquired by Microsoft. R is the future, SAS is the past."
datascience,3bcsmp,SmlCreaturesSuchAsWe,5,Sun Jun 28 05:40:44 2015 UTC,"Good points so far. I agree that long-term SAS will continue to lose market share to R. Newer data sciences certainly prefer R (http://www.burtchworks.com/2015/05/21/2015-sas-vs-r-survey-results/) and smaller companies are especially averse to paying for a SAS license when R is available for free.  In spite of that, there are still many companies that use SAS and won't be switching anytime soon because they don't want to update legacy code or replace entire teams of SAS programmers. Healthcare, banking/finance, and government are especially loyal to SAS.  For that reason I'd suggest you learn SAS while you're in school, while access is free. Once you leave school it'll be easy to pick up R since you can download it free at any time and use the plethora of educational resources that are already online. You'll have a much more difficult time doing the same for SAS, so this is probably the best opportunity you have to learn it.  You'll still have plenty of industry options if you never learn SAS, but I do worry that you'll end up closing some doors by only knowing R."

The breadth and integration of the SAS ecosystem far outstrips anything R can offer. Show me the equivalent of DI studio functionality in the R world. It doesn't exist.  A lot of companies have standardized on SAS because of the integration with their whole suite of products, their support, and the fact that there are tested and controlled features. Sure you can go download the latest package of XYZ from CRAN, but you have zero guarantee that there's not some implementation / logic problem (the biggest example of which I can think of is the ward.d dist implementation, which was not correctly implemented resulting in ward.d2 having to be added).

Yes, SAS has a lot of bells and whistles, but that a good software does not make! The fact that they have integrated all these tools into a monolith of a software package does not mean this is a useful software package. A lot of the data cleaning stuff that you do in SAS, one can do as one liners in sed or awk. R is free software so the packages are alive, constantly updated and very much reliable.

A good analyst or good programmer is flexible on the technology because the analytic approach is the same.  So my answer is to learn both because they will be different tools to accomplish similar tasks and demonstrating technological flexibility will give you a leg up in the entry/junior level job search. Even if you only pick one, as a manager I want to know that you know how to think and could adapt if we had a different tech stack than what you used in school.

It's a skillset that's extensively used in the wild; programming-wise, there's nothing else quite like it (so if you come across SAS code in the wild, it's hard to read without knowing some SASisms); and it's prohibitively expensive to learn in your own time.

datascience,3bekw2,BaronKillRage,4,Sun Jun 28 15:14:11 2015 UTC,"Hey, just replying because I want to put my 2¢ in, but I think you should go for the CompSci + Statistics route.  I did a Mathematics and Statistics degree and honestly, I went in with a similar mindset to you. I wanted to make money. Mathematics is a rigorous discipline, but with my degree there was very little application. The applications I did find were from my statistics courses. Applications of Borel measures to RVs leading to financial martingale models, etc. So, if you want to apply everything you've learned, I recommend statistics. The CompSci is what will make you a data scientist and not just a statistician. I was very interested in programming from before I started my degree, so I took all the courses that involved R and I'm better for it, because that's where my job search has become easier. But had I done something that was closer to CompSci and further from Mathematics, I think I would have had more exposure to programming syntax, thinking in algorithmic complexity and just more directed towards Data Science. I like maxToTheJ's suggestion, re: Compsci then Stats masters, but I think you'll have to work really hard to understand the material in your masters, because you won't have had the foundation  Good luck"
datascience,3bekw2,maxToTheJ,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:49:04 2015 UTC,Awesome thanks for the in depth reply. Its sounding more like the combined major in compsci/statistics is the route I should be going.
datascience,3bekw2,XTranspose,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:54:31 2015 UTC,A combined major wont let you get depth and require some classes that wont be particularly useful. With declared majors come required courses unless you go to particularly liberal programs. If you arent going to get a PhD it would be good if could simulate depth which I dont recommend if your long term goal is to go to industry.   I am maximizing for your ability to find work. Currently it seems like many places have CS grads doing data science which means they tend to hire other CS grads. Spreading yourself over courses which you might not need might lead to a drop in your grades.  It is better to be at the top of your CS program as an undergrad then in the middle of your masters Stats program as opposed to being in the middle in your undergrad because you spread yourself thin and top in your masters program.  Always showing an upwards trajectory is where you want to be

It's third to San Francisco and Boston in terms of how many openings I'm working on for the area. However, I think looking for a ""Data Science Consultancy"" is pretty limiting. Many agencies are bringing Data Scientists on board to tackle more advanced problems with bigger, messier, unstructured data. However, they do plenty of traditional analytics, higher level business strategy, etc. Often, Data Scientists work as internal experts that support the consultants when they get out of their depth. Basically, Data Scientists are too expensive and skilled to waste on a lot of clients and problems, so a consultancy that is full of Data Scientists is extremely pricey to run.    I'd be happy to get in touch and potentially discuss NYC area options (including a consulting startup that leans heavily towards DS).

datascience,3b596c,Noweightsatthegym,3,Fri Jun 26 02:05:34 2015 UTC,"I'm coming at it from a different side, I did a math major, and now I'm trying to pivot to data science and visualization by working on my own a couple days a week.  I feel for me, that my strong math and statistics background is ESSENTIAL. It makes everything else come more easily. I took online classes in big data and object-oriented programming/high level intro CS, watched some Python tutorials, and started cranking. I am really excited about what I'm doing and learning, and have a lot of confidence in my ability to self train everything I need to make my ideas happen. If I didn't know the underlying math and, more than that, problem solving heuristics, just the overall approach to analysis in general... I think I'd feel pretty lost.  I think you can't really self teach math. You need to do problem sets. You need to memorize proofs for tests. You need to go to office hours and ask questions. Maybe I'm just blinded by my own experience, but I just can't imagine getting the kind of rigor you need from online materials. The online courses I've taken were not very rigorous, I mean they convey some great information, but they don't really TRAIN you in the habits of mind that take you to another math level.  I do suggest going for an MS in the most math/stats heavy program you can find. There will always be jobs for people who can do that stuff, because it's hard, and not enough people really know how to do it. Being solid in fundamentals is very important.  Definitely make sure you choose the right program. If you can't get into your dream program, get yourself trained up to where you can. Don't just settle for a cheap program. You need really good professors and high standards, a well regarded program with a good track record. Otherwise, the other poster is right and it's just a waste of money. I fundamentally disagree with the idea that education has to immediately pay off financially to be worth it, but also, don't be a sucker. Hope that helps."
datascience,3b596c,77cruzviz77,2,Fri Jun 26 04:54:19 2015 UTC,"If you can't get into your dream program, get yourself trained up to where you can.   I think one of the hardest things to train up, and which is often overlooked by people making the ""leap"" into Data Science, is the business acumen and creativity necessary to solve everyday problems with data.  Coming up with interesting hypotheses to test and determining the what and where of the data source.  It's hard to teach in school, and I think it's what separates the ""really good"" data scientists.  Let's face it, the vast majority of business problems don't require cutting edge machine-learning techniques or complex programming work; most of the work is data munging.  So, math/stats, yes.   Programming, yes.  But a keen eye for problem-solving and domain expertise is at least as important."

My domain of most experience is environmental data and I can't tell you how crazy messy it has gotten. But, I don't feel that is hard to pick up along the way as long as you have a hands-on enthusiasm and seek out applied types of courses and projects.   I have a story that might be an example of why the math/stats background is so key. When I was working in consulting, we had some messy raw data that had to be fed through a prediction model. We only interested in min/max/average for the results. Because running the model was a bit dicey, my colleague suggested we just run the min/max/avg of our input data. But because of my math background, I was able to explain that this was implicitly assuming a linear model and independent normally-distributed inputs, which were clearly not the case on any of those points. I'm not sure this is even a story that will strike fear in the hearts of people without the math/stats background, but for me I literally got clammy hands just imagining how wrong our analysis could have been."

datascience,3b596c,DJ_InsideVoice,0,Thu Jul 2 23:48:10 2015 UTC,"I've given this advice out a lot.  The quick answer is, no enrolling in an MS is a terrible idea.  By joining an MS program you are going to spend 20k+ (40+ in California) getting an education for a job that in all likelihood, won't be paying nearly what it pays today when you are done.    In my mind you should continue the self study but also look at more immediate transfers you can make that round out your gaps and establish you.  Data Science salaries are primed to fall any day now, if you truly have a passion for analytics then pivot to something BI related now and continue to build your statistical acumen.  It's a safe bet career-wise that is already established and still gives you the opportunity to transfer into a Data Science role later.  BI roles as a ""Data Analyst's"" are great starting points.  EDIT:  I guess I should clarify, I would recommend against getting a Data Science or even ""Analytics"" degree.  If you were going to go for a Mathematics or Comp-Sci program both of those are solid choices."

There are a few data science/analyics programs that have an established recruiting/placement process and publicly post employment statistics.  Northwestern and NC state both come to mind.   If you get into an MS program that will get you into the field with a high starting salary, you'll be fine.  I wouldn't recommend doing any of the newer or online programs.  There will always be a demand for good data scientists, statisticians, quants, whatever you want to call it.

datascience,3b596c,DJ_InsideVoice,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:33:45 2015 UTC,"I think you disagree with some of this because we are talking apples and oranges.  Nobody is saying that the world doesn't need good quants and statisticians, that's nothing new and it's not changing.   Data Science on the other hand is part of a huge hype cycle.  The near term, like 1-2 years, for data science looks great.  Past that you are going to see end user tools encroach on the big data space.  Once SAS has completed their big platform solution (it's there already but very immature) they are going to eviscerate the salaries for big data scientists.  If tableau server could run in a distributed context a huge chunk of ""data scientists"" would become data analysts overnight.  Once this happens you would be better served having developed deep competency in either statistics or in data engineering, both of which are still necessary regardless of the tooling  I see many university programs equivalent to getting a Masters in Six Sigma.  You can skill up to get today's ""hot job"", but a few years down the road when the next big things comes along you are unprepared to switch to because your skills are too specialized and their are gaps in core knowledge needed to pivot within a field."

Regardless, I agree that statistics and data engineering /back end software dev can only be automated so much, and the demand for those skills is pretty much future proof...   I see it a lot on here that MS in data science/analytics programs are a terrible idea.. and frankly I think its just that people haven't done any research. I'm sure there are some garbage programs out there, but there are at least a few reputable ones... Industry speaks  http://www.analytics.northwestern.edu/current-students/career%20placement.html  http://analytics.ncsu.edu/?page_id=248  Not sure about northwestern's program, but NC state's is very stats heavy and I can speak confidently to the quality of the program..  Taking a quick look at northwestern's classes they offer courses on regression, optimization, OOP, etc... skills that will be marketable and useful for a long time, regardless of how the job title ""data scientist"" pans out  Just like ""web masters"" of the 90's had to learn new skills to transition to software dev, dba's, etc, the work that data scientists do will probably change and become more specialized over time.

For the former, you can look at ARIMA and SARIMA models. A common tactic is to forecast demand at the highest reasonable level possible (for a retailer it may be nation-wide) where there's less noise, and then to allocate that demand down. Once you have demand forecasted, you can plan supply according to how your business works.      For the latter, assuming you have many things you're selling and many possible customers, you can look into collaborative filtering and recommender systems. Once you're able to match your 'supply' to your 'demand', you can take the next step of trying to manage it."

datascience,3b3s5t,datasciencetemp,6,Thu Jun 25 18:59:43 2015 UTC,"I'm a Ph.D. candidate (4th year grad student) in political science and have recently transitioned over to a data science career. I'm still going to finish my Ph.D., but the opportunity to start work as a data scientist now was too tempting to put off for another year or two. Data science as a field is fairly diverse and the diversity and depth of expertise you will need varies largely across employers/industries. However, you will absolutely want the following:   Proficiency in a scientific programming environment. Pick one and become good at it. You can learn a second later if you need to. The big ones are:   R Python (and the Pandas, Scikit-learn libraries) Scala (less popular but hot for big data right now)  Some database skills. This is (in my opinion) a bit less important than point #1 since you'll be at the mercy of your employer in terms of what DB technology you'll actually use. That said, it will look good if you have some experience working with SQL databases. A passion for and understanding of statistics and machine learning. However, you don't need to be a statistician. What you need is to:   Demonstrate an ability to formulate a problem in such a way that it is answerable with data. Be able to research appropriate methods in academic literature. Be able to implement methods in the programming language of your choice. In some environments, you'll just find a pre-packaged version. However, in the fun data science world (especially for truly big data applications), you will often need to implement bespoke models that are tailored to your software and hardware environment as well as your data.  A demonstrated ability to convey, in pictures and plain language, the results of your analysis. Much easier said than done. You will also need to consider whether you love data analysis for the journey or for the result. Coming from academia, I have found that one of the harder transitions is that you just don't always care about the question you're asking. I'm in the fortunate position of having a social science-oriented data science career, but sometimes wonder if I'd be unhappy to find myself doing marketing analytics for Walmart 10 years from now.   So, those are the things you'll need to be happy and successful in data science. On to your other questions:     Bachelor's Degree? Online classes and then a Master's Degree? Directly into a Master's?   Depends on how bad your math & stats-fu is, I suppose. In my experience (in a weird part of data science that is not necessarily representative of industry as a whole), most data scientists are Ph.Ds who have left their fields and transitioned straight into data science. Lots of economists, biostatisticians, political scientists, etc. Their credentials, then, are a bit of coursework in stats and a demonstrated ability to solve hard problems with quantitative methods in research projects / papers. It doesn't hurt to have coursework in stats and computer science, but employers are really looking for smart people who can solve novel problems, not just coursework. Your academic work likely demonstrates this and so it is just a matter of transforming your academic CV into something that is more resume-like. For instance, I don't have a list of papers that I've written. Instead, I list research projects. ""Doe, John (2013) 'A Study of Such and Such'"" then becomes something like ""Implemented Bayesian hierarchical predictive models of such and such for some briefly-described goal or purpose.""      This is a terrible idea, fuck off!?   Nah. I've been much happier here (granted, I've only been doing it for a few months). Data science is fun.     The field is up-and-coming and the long term job prospects are good in all areas related to data science   Sometimes I worry that it's a bubble. But I don't have any actual idea. It is super hot right now, though.     I would have to learn programming, advanced stats/math, and lots of the other technical skills required to succeed in this new (possible) career.    Programming: yes! Yes yes yes.  Advanced stats/math: yes, but not quite as much. But still yes. If you're going to learn some math, start with linear algebra, then move on to real analysis, and topology. Linear algebra is by far the most important. The other two are important depending on how research-oriented your position is. They'll be less important in applied settings and more important in R&D settings. As for stats, here's some important stuff: probability theory, frequentist versus Bayesian paradigms, maximum likelihood estimation,regression analysis. Also, don't forget machine learning. Machine learning is what you get when statistics is reinvented by computer scientists. There is huge overlap between stats and machine learning, but the methods employed can vary greatly. lots of the other technical skills: sure, but not so many. Make sure you're at least comfortable with UNIX-like operating systems, ssh and command-line tools in general. Also, the concepts of cloud computing, Big O notation, parallel computing, and MapReduce. You don't need to rock at any of these starting out (nobody does), just make sure you can talk intelligently about them.      very strong teaching evals   Play this up on your resume and in interviews as a demonstrated ability to communicate complex and scientific concepts to a wide audience in an entertaining and enlightening way.     I don’t know how to program   Two ways to go about this one. Either take courses or start a blog and a Github account. What employers want to see is a demonstrated ability to code. You don't have to be a software engineer, but you should be sort of close to that. The line between software engineer and data scientist is nearly non-existent at times. So, coursework alone probably won't cut it anyways. It would have to be coursework with some nice final projects to show off. The alternative is to open a Github account and write some blogs about the projects you've worked on either for yourself or in collaboration with others. For instance, I found a few statistical models that aren't yet implemented in R and so I wrote short blog posts about them and included code to run them. I haven't put these on my resume, but suppose I could in the future if it was ever pertinent.     Finally, I would advise you to look for data science jobs that are in some way similar to the work you currently do. Presumably you have some expertise in social science already; are there private or government organizations interested in your area of research that also have data science positions available? For example, if you've written articles on or involving elections or polling, you could look for positions in political consulting firms.   Anyways, good luck! Data science is lots of fun if you're into problem solving, statistics, and some computer science."
datascience,3b3s5t,mil24havoc,3,Thu Jun 25 23:50:16 2015 UTC,"/u/mil24havoc hit most of the main points. I'm in a similar situation as yourself now and have been dedicating myself to really learning Python. Based on my experience as a complete novice (no programming knowledge) to now being able to solve some simple data problems, I recommend a path such as this (assuming you choose Python and not R - can't help with that decision, I just chose Python because I feel it has the added benefit of having wider applications in everyday life):   An intro course or two on Python as a whole. You can do something like codecademy or choose something from the learnpython wiki (new to programming section) Following an introductory knowledge to Python, I HIGHLY recommend this course: MIT OCW Intro to Comp Sci 6.00 The video lectures are extremely informative, it offers many problem sets and practice problems, and it really teaches the basics and fundamental theories behind using the language.   After that, there are tons of courses on Udemy (like this one), tutorials on YouTube and tracks on Coursera and Edx. I think after you do a general Data Science track and a Machine Learning track, you should be on your way.  As I mentioned before, I'm still new to this. I welcome any experienced professionals to weigh in on this advice (for my benefit as well as OP's).  Hope that helps."
datascience,3b3s5t,MJMarto,3,Fri Jun 26 22:01:15 2015 UTC,"Following up on /u/MJMarto, if you do choose Python, I recommend Learn Python the Hard Way. It's free online.  I am personally more fond of R for data science. /u/MJMarto is right that Python is more broadly useful, but R is much easier to jump straight into data analytics. The flip side of that is that R is a more difficult programming language to master. They tend to play nicely together, though, and most data scientists I know are experts at one and have some familiarity with the other.   To get started with R, download R Studio. To get started with Python, download Python and an IDE like PyDev or iPython. Don't stress over Python 2 or 3. Just pick one and stick with it. I recommend 3 just because it's going to be supported for longer than 2."

datascience,3b39du,timy2shoes,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:36:27 2015 UTC,"Well of course that depends on the nature of the data and the phenomena you are observing, it is not always a matter of accuracy. If it is something not very complex you will do fine with smaller datasets or just sampling to capture all there is to be known about it.  Now think about complex systems like social interactions, human health, etc, you can capture huge amounts of data just to characterize a part of the phenomena, and there's when big data starts playing a role to detect complex interactions and subtle signals that would be observable with coarser data.  I usually think about it this way. Imagine you want to detect cancer using a body scanner, current technology gives you images on the field of a few GB. Yet we can't detect small tumors. If we wanted to detect single cancer cells then we would need a much higher resolution (and other things) which would make the image size exponentially but would allow us to detect signals that were impossible to detect with less information."

It will be a lot of data but most of the data will be the same."
datascience,3b39du,ddttox,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:48:39 2015 UTC,"One of the dangers of big data is that you can reliably detect relationships or effects that are very subtle and small and it is easy to get focused those relationships as something important. And, nice models, reproducible effects and statistical significance can sidetrack you from grappling with practical significance.  Practical significance, is there a way to intervene or take action on this relationship? Are such actions ethical and affordable? Would such actions yield a better outcome than applying the same resources elsewhere? What are the ripple effects in the system if actions are implemented based on this discovered relationship? Are the relationships detected so small that even if we take successful targeted action based on the analysis and it actually works would anyone notice the change in the system?"

I had matlab, R, and Mathematica experience, but not much else. I did some PHP and eventually picked up JavaScript. Most of my work was web development, and on the side I picked up Python. I played with projects and machine learning libraries. I did kaggle competitions and so on.   I'm still fresh to data science, but I was a more attractive candidate because I had math as a background, as well as several years of software development in the wild, so I know about software development principles and how to work on a team.   Adding to that the data science side projects, that seemed to help ease the notion that I had abandoned math and gone full software developer, as well.   This may not be a great path for you, but maybe it'll help somehow."

If I were to do it all over again, I'd really pick up some web development and make some sort of web app based project for a math class in my last year. Then I would find local meetups for the technologies I used and start meeting people.  Kaggle is pretty cool. A big variety of problems, but it definitely favors the people that post the problem. ""Here solve my business problem for free so I can make millions off it."" But like I said. Fun. You might also just consider getting some inspiration from one of those projects and make a blog post about a problem and how you gathered, cleaned, analyzed, and visualized the data.   I think if you showed that you put up a site and talked through a data science project, A-Z, that would be tremendous for a portfolio."

I have a BA in Math and have been trying to decide what to do with myself after college only knowing I want to pursue something more technical while hopefully incorporating aspects of my degree.  Granted you are definitely more advanced than myself in the Math and Statistics department, which is already a strong plus.  For a few months now I've been trying to dive into Data Science and it's pretty overwhelming with all there is to know and it's tempting to jump from topic to topic without getting too deep into any of them.    Granted, I don't have too much in the way of advice for you since I am in the same spot.  I've taken bits and pieces of a couple of the Coursera courses in the Data Science specialization and they are quite useful and give you some experience with R.  I'm also looking to attending the Galvanize program in Denver in Data Science which is an intensive 12 week program in DS with a focus on using Python (hence why I haven't kept up with the Coursera specialization).  I also just started a Data Science internship with a startup, although I'm quickly realizing that it's not so much a DS internship as a marketing internship trying to pitch to Data Scientists.  Oops...  Hopefully I'll be able to ignore most of the inevitable marketing bullshit and actually get something useful out of it (can you detect my subtle distain for marketing? lol)  My own, admittedly naive, suggestion would be to become more proficient in Python and some of the statistical analysis packages that exist (e.g., NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn) as well as IPython.  Once you have a basic working understanding of some of that you can start diving into some of the IPython notebooks that others have created (YHat has some amazing ones) and, at the very least, get a little better of an idea of the kind of questions that are asked and generally how one could approach the problem.    Sorry, I know this probably doesn't help all that much since I am by no means an expert...  Hell, you're probably more advanced than me!    EDIT: On a side note, I love your username.

However, if the people who want access to the data are not technical, and if your company can afford it, you should get a BI tool like Looker. Looker sits on top of a SQL-dialect database and makes it easy for people throughout the company to access to data they need, while letting the more technical people handle all the technical stuff (db connections, access restrictions, data modeling)."

I found that switching to a more keyboard-centric workflow helped a lot.  The mouse requires a lot of small, precise movements that (probably) contributed to my pain.  Vim is way better for your wrists than Emacs, but Emacs has more of the features that I want (basically it's more like an IDE).

datascience,3aqbe1,34tendil,2,Tue Jun 23 00:56:01 2015 UTC,"Aside from the below tips, there are some great packages in python that have no equivalence in R:   Numba: write pure python code that is multithreaded and fast on the order of C Blaze and Dask: You can use this for on disk out of core/distributed dataframe and array processing over different backends   Pymc 3: This differs from stan in that you are writing your models, with more concision in pure python (vs C++) and by allowing discrete random variables. Bokeh downsampling: You can graph much larger datasets because bokeh server dynamically processes only what the current zoom level on the screen can handle. Also there is a roadmap for this to become  the future shiny for python.   Also make sure you use the anaconda distribution with it's conda package manager. Try seaborn and bokeh for graphing. Follow continuum analytics on twitter. Google groups are pydata and statsmodels. Also #pydata hashtag.

datascience,3ajq78,Xiphilius,6,Sat Jun 20 21:37:57 2015 UTC,"I have been taking various classes on all three platforms. They are more or less the same and it just depends on what you are exactly looking for. If you just want to learn and gain expertise in Data Science, just take any course. If you want to actually get a certification that shows you have completed the classes, you could pay for it. Personally, I think they are bit over priced but you are getting an education from a top university for fraction of a cost and they need paid subscription to keep the sites running. Initially, I started using this Trello Board, https://trello.com/b/rbpEfMld/data-science,  but also doing the specializations on each platform for free."
datascience,3ajq78,chiron90,2,Sat Jun 20 22:48:07 2015 UTC,"but you are getting an education from a top university for fraction of a cost    As a data science resume screener, I can tell you that MOOC certifications and classes do not carry even a fraction of the weight as an on campus degree from these schools. You get bragging rights for attending a top school because you were admitted through the rigorous application process, MOOCs do not offer this credential.  Going to Stanford means you're (usually) super smart. Taking Andrew Ng's machine learning class does not."
datascience,3ajq78,GoldmanBallSachs_,9,Sun Jun 21 00:14:00 2015 UTC,"The top 272 students in Sebastian's machine learning course were online students. Exact same Curriculum provided to both online and Stanford students.  There is certainly a high level of prestige in attending great universities, but that's a commitment many people can't make - particularly those making career changes (as OP mentioned).  Education is no longer a one time event between the ages of 18-24."
datascience,3ajq78,walesmd,3,Sun Jun 21 04:05:55 2015 UTC,I would hope to think that with a MOOC certificate and a portfolio of good work published on github should at least get you an interview - Isn't there a shortage of Data Analysts and Scientists?
datascience,3ajq78,UnderdogIS,2,Sun Jun 21 00:46:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Personally I think a degree is just a piece of paper, I have 4 of them (3 Bachelors and 1 Masters) and is only to gain credibility but that does not necessarily equate to being smart or actually being better then someone who does not have a degree. Some of the people I have worked with in the field of Data Science have no degrees, yet their knowledge and skills surpass majority of these graduates."
datascience,3ajq78,chiron90,2,Sun Jun 21 03:25:52 2015 UTC,"If your ability to judge someone's abilities is limited to checking where they graduated, then your passing up lots of great candidates. Let's say instead, that a degree from the right school in the right field is currently hard for anyone to put together online. However, the way things are progressing most middle rate universities are going to be hard pressed to compete with what you can find online."

datascience,3ajq78,chiron90,6,Sun Jun 21 03:22:58 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend our Data Science Nanodegree but I'm a bit biased (Web Dev Curriculum Manager at Udacity).  The program is quite extensive and challenging. You'll come out of it with a portfolio of projects that have been not only functionally reviewed but line by line code reviewed. You'll have access to a community of your peers and our coaching staff, all of which have extensive programming backgrounds.  Enrollment opens for a week on the first Wednesday of each month and if you complete the program we'll refund half your expenses.  If you have any other questions let me know. I can either answer them directly or find the right person for you to talk to."
datascience,3ajq78,walesmd,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:39:48 2015 UTC,"Awesome response Mike.   I completed the Front-End Nanodegree and can say it was completely worth it. I was apprehensive about doing the paid version at first. After completing the program I am glad I did the full experience and did not just complete the free courses. With the extra mentoring, resources and the group experience it is so much impact full. The 50% back upon graduation was not offered with the first Cohort. For me that is even more motivation to make it to the finish line.   Of course this was the Front-End Nanodegree and I can not directly speak about the Data Science Nanodegree. I would recommend taking the introduction course and decide after that."

Udacity has some very high quality courses, that are oriented around maintaining engagement throughout the lectures.  You even code in the browser, which is nice for using multiple machines.  That said, Coursera and edx both have some good options as well.    I think the Intro to Machine Learning course on Coursera is one of the best at doing exactly what the title says.    As far as edx, The Analytics Edge from MIT is a fantastic, applied approach to analytics that doesn't get too bogged down in the details.  It's also a wonderful intro to R and using a lot R's powerful capabilities from the get go."

The intermittent quizzes are good.  The ability to link from the lecture right to relevant spots in the forums is great.  However, the content seems deeper on Coursera.  It varies by course, but Coursera offers more which means they tend to have more specialized classes.  Some specific recommendations:  Sebastian Thrun's statistics course on Udacity was quite good.  The Johns Hopkins Data Science courses on Coursera are also very solid."
datascience,3ajq78,thornkin,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:28:46 2015 UTC,"I personally recommend:  EdX > Coursera > Udacity  Udacity is really good at starting you off with some ideas but it really lacks the depth.  Coursera is quite good, however I feel like some of their courses vary in quality.   I've been doing the EdX Spark course and it is fantastic - very nice balance between lectures and interesting labs. I haven't had a bad course on the EdX platform, but then again it's the platform I've used the least.  Is there anything in particular you want to learn? I could recommend some specific materials."

datascience,3ajq78,jackdoesketo,2,Mon Jun 22 09:07:26 2015 UTC,"Most data science courses are really focused on applications and are written for computer scientists, I feel like all you need to get into stuff like Ng's course is a first course in Linear Algebra (probably go through Khan Academy's stuff) and descriptive and inferential stats. Udacity is okay for the stats but honestly I have done a handful of STAT101 courses at both uni and online and have never ""gotten"" stats."

datascience,3al1po,dogssaygoodnight,2,Sun Jun 21 06:17:49 2015 UTC,"I worked in fraud prevention for an insurance company for about 2 years. The fraud/intelligence community is quite tight knit, at least where I live anyway, so we get to hear about the techniques they use. Most fraud analysts have an enforcement background (ie police, customs, immigration, tax, defence) and they move into private companies because they pay better. Out of probably 20+ fraud analysts or intelligence analysts I have met, NONE OF THEM knew coding. I think some knew a few basic SQL CRUD commands but they were a true rare exception.  Basically, they are not coders because the software they use dont require them to be. IBM i2 (which is what I used), Wynyard and Palantir (all counter intelligence tools, including anti-fraud) all are drag and drop style tools which dont require coding but of course, have a learning curve.  I am sure there would be some coders out there that are involved in fraud somehow but I can only assume they are hard core computer science grads implementing machine learning algorithms and systems that observe overall high level patterns or anomalies rather than investigate individual instances of fraud. If you are interested in the field of investigating individual instances, learning coding isnt required (although it certainly wont harm you).  My advice would be to get your courses and certs, blog your learnings and apply for junior roles (intelligence analyts) from enforcement agencies or banking or insurance companies (Anti Money Laundering analysts or fraud analysts) again and again. Of course, when you blog your learnings, make sure you put your blog's link on your resume so that you show the hirer that you are both passionate about the area and know a bit about it as well.   My intuition says the best approach would be police (you dont have to be a sworn officer) or customs because you have a legal background."

datascience,3aizgw,goldfather8,4,Sat Jun 20 17:32:21 2015 UTC,"I'm also a Math undergrad who wants to get into Data Science, but I have a background in Statistics. Given that, you should take my perspective with a grain of salt, especially since I don't know when your interview is. Here's what I've done:   All of Statistics by Larry Wasserman is a good reference book for Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics. (You can find a PDF of it online, somewhere.) If you have absolutely no background in either, I recommend you skim through the first two parts and do the exercises.  This is a great resource to learn about Statistical Learning. Download the book, read through parts of it, and do the  exercises.  EdX has a MOOC that's been recommended around here a few times before. It's called The Analytics Edge. It's Data Science-y. It's in R. They take you through linear regression, log regression, classification, etc. Udacity doesn't have the best reputation around here, but I thought their Machine Learning MOOC (the one taught by Sebastian Thrun not the GATech one), is good for exposing yourself to scikit-learn, a Python library for machine learning."

datascience,3aizgw,Nixonite,2,Sat Jun 20 20:14:54 2015 UTC,"If your interview is in 3 weeks, then you don't have the time to get deep in the stats book. I know this because that book is sitting on my desk right now and it took at least 10 minutes to get through 2 pages.   I'm assuming that you have at least taken a probability class - that's a good start. Might be worth reviewing some of that material.  For technical stuff, definitely look into SQL, and if the job description mentioned Excel then look into that as well. Data science jobs are often involving the Hadoop framework, which requires some knowledge of Java and other languages - this one cannot be learned easily.   Many data science interviews on glassdoor show that data structures and algorithms are often talked about - especially those regarding trees. Review that stuff.  Get a handle on either R or Python's scientific libraries - whichever one the position asks for. I'm not sure how far you can get in the 3 weeks that you have with all of the above mentioned material, but try and get a little bit of everything and a lot of one or two things."

datascience,3aizgw,will-stanton,2,Sun Jun 21 00:58:49 2015 UTC,"At this point, you need to ""hack"" the interview a little bit. I have a couple of posts on this on my blog: R and Hadoop hacking, general info about getting a data science job. There are probably three main parts of the interview that you should focus on:  Technical  If you are already proficient in Python, then you should probably do the quick-start tutorial on scikit-learn. Download the Anaconda distribution of Python to get all the packages you need.  You should also try a simple project, probably a Kaggle competition. The Titanic competition on Kaggle has a bunch of tutorials.   You also need to know SQL. It is very easy to pick up. Just do a tutorial on SQLZoo. It will only take a few hours.  Finally, you need to just sit down and read a bit about machine learning and stats. Just spend a few hours reading about machine-learning in general (the scikit tutorial and examples are pretty good for this). For stats, I am sure there are few simple youtube courses so that you can learn the basics, especially the terminology.  General Interview Skills You need to make sure that you actually know how to interview in general. Ramit Sethi has some great general interview advice. For example, you should know how to answer the typical interview questions, like ""Tell us about yourself,"" ""Why do you want to work here"" and ""What is your biggest weakness"". Practice answering them out loud and preferably with your friends. If you can't do these properly, then you will not get hired. If you are great at these, you may get a little bit of leeway on the technical questions.   Company Specific Prep  This is also super important, but people miss it all the time. You need to learn all you can about the company. Read the entire corporate website if you can. Find a couple of newspaper articles about the company. What is their strategy? How can data science help? What are their biggest challenges coming up? Come prepared with a few questions about the business.   If you can, ""stalk"" the people you will be working with on LinkedIn. What technologies do they use? What is their job title? What does that tell you about the team structure?  The most important thing about all of this is that they probably already know your background. You will really impress them if you've shown initiative and interest about data science. Don't spend hundreds of hours on prep and freak out. Do ""enough"" and then go into the interviews relaxed and prepared. If this one doesn't work out, there will be other companies in the future. Best of luck!"

datascience,3aizgw,patrickSwayzeNU,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:59:57 2015 UTC,Junior DS probably means something completely different depending on the company.  You should try to find out what the job will actually be doing.
datascience,3aizgw,PlaidPenguin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:01:19 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised no one else here has said this: your number one priority in any interview is to make sure you actually know what you put on your resume.  You got a callback. They liked you and your resume enough to see past the things you were missing (assuming you were honest about your lack of stats/ml experience). This most likely means they are assuming you will be able to pick up whatever extra knowledge you need on the job. No one with any stats or ml experience applies to a DS job without mentioning it, so that's a pretty safe assumption.  I wouldn't be surprised if the primary reason you got the callback was your experience with django, if it something they use regularly. How long ago was the SE internship? Have you interacted with django since then? I would make sure to brush up on that first, if you feel shaky on it.  Did you list anything else on your resume or cover letter that might have been a reach? Did you claim any experience with languages that you took one class in or worked on one project in a few years back? I would say those topics ought to be your next focus after django. (Unless the languages are fairly unlikely to be used at this job.)  Next, I would look up as many names of data scientists at the company as you can and see if you can find any of their blogs, technical twitter accounts, published research, etc. Any better grasp you can get on the actual machine learning techniques that they apply would be super helpful. And if they've posted a recent blog or tweet about a problem that they've recently solved? That's a gold nugget right there. Learn the concepts involved in that post as fast as you can, and be able to speak intelligently about them. If the concepts involved in that problem are vaguely related to the job description that you applied for, there's a very good chance you will be asked a question along those lines. If you can have a good conversation about their solution, that's awesome. I mean, don't just repeat word-for-word what they did, and don't treat any material you can find like this as the answer guide to the test, but just use it as a basis for spending your researching time very wisely.  If you had a couple months to really dig in before your interview, I think it would be great to do almost all of the things that have been listed here. If you have the time, it's probably a good idea to go over some general stats fundamentals. You can find good references for that all over the internet and this subreddit."
datascience,3ahjio,john_philip,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:09:27 2015 UTC,"As a fairly average guy, I'm always afraid of these kinds of articles - this isn't the first one to show that girls rate guys less attractive on the whole than guys rate girls. This one is almost kind of inspiring to the average Joe though.... Almost.     One sees that with the exception of the ratees in columns 10 and 16, all ratees had at least one rater who perceived her attractiveness to be noticeably above average and at least one rater who perceived her attractiveness to be noticeably below average.     This is pretty good news for most people - it's apparently pretty rare to be universally considered attractive or unattractive. So as long as they play the numbers game, most people should be able to end up with a partner who is subjectively a 10/10 knockout eventually. The only issue is that this part of the article is only looking at males rating females. I hope that the results would look the same for females rating males, but I don't think that's a sound assumption... /u/john_philip, did you write this?

It is very reasonable, and there are definitely GPU instances available. The cost only includes running time, so as soon as you're done processing, all it takes is a click to stop your instance and no longer be charged for procession, while saving all your data and configuration (as long as its an EBS storage instance). You still get charged for storage, but that comes out to $0.10/GB-Month  In addition to being convenient and cost-effective, it seems like a useful skill to know your way around AWS."

datascience,3a85r7,will-stanton,3,Thu Jun 18 16:32:19 2015 UTC,"how do you build your own w/o strong senior data science talent currently on staff?   That is a very good question. I'm not sure I would recommend hiring very junior people unless you have someone experienced on staff. Some companies go the route of:    Find (and pay for) a senior data scientist who likes people management and training. Fill out the team with more junior people with a lot of potential (e.g. people with great educational backgrounds, or open-source contributors, or great soft skills, etc.)"
datascience,3a85r7,elblanco,2,Thu Jun 18 16:43:26 2015 UTC,"That's harder. You almost always need somebody senior. It can be expensive since you'll want somebody good, but you can view the senior person as an investment who will likely change jobs/retire eventually and your junior person can grow into the more senior position at a lower cost. You'll also get productive work out of the senior person while they're there, so it's not a sunk cost."
datascience,3a85r7,WallyMetropolis,6,Thu Jun 18 17:51:22 2015 UTC,"Are you an in-house recruiter, or third-party. High skill, in demand employees get a lot of spam from third-party recruiters and unless they've gotten to a place where they're sort of desperate (which is rare, but can happen) will generally ignore them.   There's really no secret to it. If the position is actually attractive --- which means it's a good place to work, with interesting problems and good team and opportunity for advancement, that offers better pay and a good work environment --- then you'll have no trouble finding interested applicants.   Otherwise, you'll have to hire more junior people looking to get experience. To successfully home-grow a data science team is harder, but it's cheaper."
datascience,3a85r7,will-stanton,3,Thu Jun 18 08:14:33 2015 UTC,"Are you asking as a recruiter, or as a candidate trying to get contacted by recruiters?  Most recruiters I know are heavily into LinkedIn. You need to have a good profile, and you need to make sure that you have the appropriate skills listed so that your profile is searchable. You can also find recruiters on LinkedIn and friend them. Lots of them expand their networks that way, so a lot of them won't mind. Then, you will be the first to know when they notify their network of a new opportunity.   Also, a lot of recruiters are happy to talk and give you some advice about how to make yourself a more attractive candidate. Be cautious of some third-party recruiters that just spam everyone without any understanding of the position. Some unscrupulous recruiters use the ""shotgun"" approach to just collect resumes and throw them at companies. Really good recruiters will want to talk to you and find out if the position is really a good fit for you."
datascience,3a85r7,will-stanton,2,Thu Jun 18 14:24:52 2015 UTC,I ask as a member of an analytics team currently recruiting candidates.  We've worked with 3rd party recruiters w/o much success. Similarly fishing on LinkedIn hasn't been fruitful. Starting to think about more unconventional recruiting methods.
datascience,3a85r7,spalunk,2,Thu Jun 18 16:31:06 2015 UTC,"Okay, sorry I was confused. Our team recently hired someone, and we had a lot of luck with local data science meetups. My manager found three great candidates at a single meetup. Our theory is that meetups are so great for a few reasons:   People who come to meetups are either looking for a job, looking to sell something, or are genuinely interested in the topic. You want people who are looking for a job and are genuinely interested in data science. The type of people who go to meetups tend to be super excited about new technologies and methods, and therefore have a decent chance of being ""unicorns."" Meetups are a very casual environment, so it's easier to talk to candidates. You also get a sense of the candidates' soft skills, which are very hard to detect from a resume. Lots of meetups let you announce your job opening right at the beginning. Enthusiastic candidates will come to you.    We are in the Boulder-Denver area, though, so there are a lot of great meetups. Not sure where you're located.  Obviously, this is involves a lot of personal legwork, but in-person meetings are a really good filter. If you need even more exposure, try giving a talk at a meetup about something cool you are doing. This will help get you exposed to the right kinds of people."
datascience,3a85r7,will-stanton,2,Thu Jun 18 16:38:11 2015 UTC,"I consider myself a high quality candidate (have the right degrees, experience, companies on my resume) and I will pretty much never deal with a third party recruiter. Having a conversation with a head hunter is spammy and impersonal and makes me think negatively of the company even if they have cool products.  LinkedIn is hit or miss with me. Sometimes I check LinkedIn frequently, but because I have good profile I have constant messages and connection requests and it takes time to weed through it all. One thing I'll say here is that adding ""or if you know anyone else who might be interested let us know"" to the end of your message pretty much guarantees I wont respond.   Meetups can be great, but I think it's important to show up with the right attitude. I have seen companies show up to our well established meet up groups and act like they own it because they have an employee giving a talk (sales pitch in disguise) and are doing some recruiting. That's a guaranteed way to get the community talking negatively about your company and it's a damn small world."
datascience,3a85r7,Doc_Nag_Idea_Man,2,Thu Jun 18 17:17:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good points there /u/spalunk. There are too many spammy recruiters out there, and it makes people distrust them.  Also, totally agreed about Meetups. Nowadays, people are very skeptical of sales pitches. You can pitch your company as a cool place to work, but giving a supposed technical talk that's really a product sales pitch is pretty lame. I think you have to be super straightforward. When I am recruiting for our company, I am pretty much stupidly transparent. :)"

I know a couple data scientists consultants and they are people with a decade or more of career experience behind them - THAT is what makes them desireable as a consultant. They know the theory and the practice. From what you have said you don't seem to have any professional data science experience. Think about another case - lots of people are consultants as programmers. Who are they generally? - people who have come up through working for someone else and have the professional experience to allow them to jump into a task without any hand-holding, and know how to get things done. The companies that I know in my area that do (or would be likely to) hire a data science consultant don't want someone with potential - they want someone who has done the job before.  If you are truly interested in data science what you should do (or rather should have done) is find an internship for the summer as a data scientist, preferably with a smaller company / startup. Anyway, why are you doing things ""on the side"" when you are in a PhD programme? In the CS department at my alma matter (one of the top-ranked schools for CS) I didn't know of anyone doing things on the side. (Must be different in cognitive science but if you are keen on CS there are likely TA, RA or Lectureship positions you could apply for.)  By the way - it is incorrect to say that anything is ""most of data science"". It is an amorphous term that means different things to different people. I know DS who are really mostly engineers who keep the injestion, transformming and logging scripts running. I know a DS who spends her time writing SQL queries, creating interactive reports in Tableau and generally providing a conduit between metadata and the people in marketing/advertising/etc.  I won't go into detail about what I do exactly, but I do a lot more than just hacking data into another format. I do some things locally (in Python, R or Scala ... or Java if I absolutely must) for experiments, but a lot of work on a cluster (big data processing). I currently do all of that in Spark (on Scala), but used to work with Pig and MapReduce. There is a learning curve involved in doing such distributed computations that you probably couldn't just jump into.  I do NLP related things as a data scientist. I don't think anyone could jump in and do what I do without domain knowledge (either from education or work experience). If you are really interested in DS you should research how you can leverage your domain knowledge (your big, big plus) to offset all the stuff you don't (yet) know to get an (industry) internship."

Although I'm not sure if becoming a data science consultant is a great idea for a PhD student, anyway. Consulting can take a lot of extra work to develop business. I tutored in grad school and made good money, but even that was a bit distracting from my real work.  It doesn't sound like you have any experience in machine learning or big data, which would make a huge difference in your data science application. You probably don't need to work directly on your programming too much if you can do enough to build some machine learning models. I recommend trying out a Kaggle competition to see how it goes.

I'm not sure if you really need more education beyond a Masters, but an MA in Sociology is not a typical background for a data scientist. You may have to make up for that with a great resume and a good portfolio of personal data science projects. Please send me a PM if you have any questions."

For predictive accuracy you only need to do better than what is currently being done. If they still expect 99% accuracy then show why it can't be done in a format they understand (i.e., PowerPoint with majority of math in the appendix). If they still push back then I break out the math and that usually solves the problem. Obviously I'll still be on the hook for delivering a suitable solution but at that point am able to reset expectations away from ""perfection""."

datascience,3a0fhv,patrickSwayzeNU,2,Wed Jun 17 18:08:25 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I have usually found that the opposite is true: upper management is generally amazed at how well machine learning can perform on lots of tasks. So I often spend too much time perfecting a model, when it could actually be ""good enough"" earlier on.  As to your question, usually an explanation of how the method works is enough to stave off any issues. The challenge is explaining something complex like a random forest or a TFIDF document-term matrix to an executive. This is a skill that I have a lot of practice with, and it makes a big difference. I have found that most smart people, even if they have very little technical knowledge, can understand most general ML concepts with an appropriate explanation.   I also tend to reflexively set expectations about the limits of a modeling approach from the very beginning of a project, even during the initial planning and resourcing phases. For example, ""We need a text classification model"" ""Well, we can definitely do that. We should expect some edge cases around unusual keywords or foreign languages, but I think we can get something that works for the business."""

So, to your question of:   How do I become like Harry   The answer is that you need to read / work through lots and lots of different types of problems that use lots and lots of different types of data.  Hence, the line above about Harry reading a lot of ML literature.  By reading a good deal of literature (or blog posts where people go into extreme detail of what they did, how they did it), you'll get a good sense of what algorithms / approaches work with what kinds of data.  If the interviewer had asked a question about product disambiguation for all of their grocery stocks (e.g. whenever Doritos comes out with a new flavor and has a new SKU, make sure our database still uses it as Doritos, rather than a whole new product), then you'd have to be familiar with techniques like Record Linkage (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_linkage)...

I work with a few analysts who definitely are skilled enough that they should be scientists, but most companies will not promote an analyst to scientist without an advanced degree, which sucks.  I'm still learning the data science end to become more effective, but honestly, data analytics is a broad field and in my experience, brings you closer to the business and product testing side of things than data scientists tend to get.  I find the data analyst side exciting because I love to see how end users interact with the final product.  Someone else mentioned SQL and Excel being the building blocks of a data analyst's toolset.  I'd add to that Google Analytics (you can use the free version and just hook it into a website), Google Adwords, Facebook Analytics, Tableau, and PowerPoint/presentation skills.  You can try all of those for free, and it gets you a glimpse into how websites and e-businesses collect data on the back end that you can later report on.  Having a head start on understanding campaign tracking and how to report trended data will be huge in your favor.  Also, on Excel, definitely master the v-lookup and Pivot table functions, which I swear I use on a daily basis.  Additionally, if you know what field you want to work in, you really need to keep up on the news in the field and build up some industry knowledge.  I work in the music industry now, so it is a lot of HypeBot and other music/tech sites.  When I interviewed for my present job, having industry knowledge of Spotify vs. Pandora offerings or the advertisement model on ITunes Radio comes across as you speak to the people you are interviewing with, and they become more convinced that you have the knowledge and passion to succeed.  Passion counts for a lot, especially if you are short on experience or fighting against other entry level applicants.  The presentation skills help you convey yourself and will give you an interviewing edge.  Edit: here is a book that helped me a lot when I was brand new to the field.  It can help you understand the jargon used in web analysis specifically, and give you ideas on how to build up your career in data: http://www.amazon.com/Web-Analytics-2-0-Accountability-Centricity/dp/0470529393"

Even if you were to somehow beat one of these candidates at their own game with limited exams under your belt, it will not help you significantly in becoming a DS. Insurance companies move slowly and do not pick up on the latest technologies quickly. Likely you would be using a combination of excel/SAS to do extremely proprietary analysis.   You are better off applying for more general analyst roles at newer companies that are using R/python/hadoop and whatnot. Even if you don't use these technologies directly, you will get more exposure than you would at an insurance firm.   I have a bachelors degree in engineering and I don't have the resources to study any more.   You're on the internet aren't you?

datascience,39vlsp,MusicIsLife1995,7,Mon Jun 15 04:03:20 2015 UTC,"How to study and learn new things.  Seriously. It's a thing. Get to know yourself as a learner (WAY harder than it sounds), get to know how to google, get used to following blogs / articles / StackOverflow on areas you're interested in, etc.  With the field as wide and fast-moving as it is, THE most important thing is to be able to learn and adapt. No two problems are ever the same."
datascience,39vlsp,thefrontpageofme,2,Mon Jun 15 06:47:59 2015 UTC,I'm going to completely agree with this.
datascience,39vlsp,WallyMetropolis,3,Mon Jun 15 08:11:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/thefrontpageofme. But in addition to learning ""how to learn,"" there are a lot of technical things you need to know. For example, data scientists tend to be strong in statistics, machine learning, and (to a lesser extent) math. They also tend to be okay (but not amazing) computer programmers, especially in Python or R. They also typically are good at working with databases, so they at least know SQL.   One other important skill that most data scientists have is that they are good at understanding project requirements and the requirements of the business. Most data scientists write code on their own, but they collaborate extensively with business leaders and other data scientists.   If you are interested, I wrote a post about some technologies and skills that are useful for data scientists: http://will-stanton.com/becoming-an-effective-data-hacker/  As for ""selling"" yourself as a data scientist, you need to do independent projects, and you need to tell people about them. For online outreach, lot of people recommend starting a personal blog, but even having a Github page with code on it is a really good start. Kaggle competitions are a great way to get started (I have tutorial on one of those, as well). Do not be afraid to post a visualization to /r/dataisbeautiful.   For ""irl"" outreach, meetup.com is a great site for networking with local data scientists. Remember, they are the people who could hire you one day, so don't be shy! That's how I got my job, actually. Feel free to PM me if you have other questions."

It's definitely more a project management role, and I would be defining requirements, use cases and such. These would be tools like interactive visualizations and data-driven deliverables and not software. The issue is that there are no other technical people on the team, so I'm concerned that I will be bogged down by the project management side given large constraints in firm capabilities and team talent.   To give you a sneak peek, they mentioned the desire to make an interactive tool based on our unique datasets, and when I mentioned making a javascript visualization in d3 they were concerned about being able to put a chart on our website to be made accessible to clients, because the IT and tech side of the company is, literally, a completely separate entity from our business unit. We are basically at the mercy of an entirely different part of the company in the IT area. I'm concerned my hands will be tied and I will be working with non-technical people to boot. Kind of feels like even though it's a cool opportunity, the whole thing might be set up to fail and I want to make sure that possibility is worth giving up the research experience.  Also, I do aspire to be on the more business/consulting side of data science rather than the engineering side. Still, I feel like practical Quant research is good for that aspiration.

It sounds like your goal is to learn those techniques by applying them to projects -- which is the best way to learn in my opinion and also very motivating and useful to others.

Which domain - insurance versus agriculture could you best see yourself in 10 years from now?  I would advise you to gain domain expertise in addition to technical excellence.   Insurance is a huge industry but known for moving slowly. In addition they already have a class of high-end analytical specialists; actuaries. Anything new in the analytical department, data science, will run up against the issue of how it fits into the existing structure of the industry.   From your comments of being drawn to the agriculture as a problem space, I would suggest you go that direction.   I will admit I am a little surprised that the university RA position is paying better than private industry insurance company.    If you go for the university RA position you should make sure that you try to get face time with the agriculture commercial partner. In fact make sure that the prof understands that exposure and recognition for your part in the project is essential - you are not going to be the silent lab partner.  Second don't start looking for your next gig or FT slot at 10 months into the engagement. In reality you are thinking about relationships and opportunities as early as 3 or 4 months into the engagement.  I don't mean that you will short-change the university, only that you will be alert and proactive about making connections within the ag industry.  If security and surety of income and a long career, potentially in the same corp. is important to you - ignore everything I have said to this point and stick it out at the insurance company. Maybe in addition to the report automation you are doing, start studying for the actuary tests. This way you are well positioned if the ""data science"" movement fizzles out.  The second benefit is that it gives you something technical to focus on and keep your mind sharp. Third, it gains you respect of the entrenched high-end analytical personnel in the company.  As always be somewhat wary of taking advice from strangers on the internet."

datascience,39m9d1,nymeatball,6,Fri Jun 12 18:57:38 2015 UTC,"The problem you're working on is called Market Basket Analysis or Association Rule Learning. An association rule is of the form {apples, bananas} -> {pears} where transactions containing the left hand side are somewhat more likely to contain the right hand side. Some metrics for evaluating the strength of a rule include support, confidence, and lift. Real quick: support is the fraction of transactions containing a certain item, confidence is the fractions of items that contain both the left hand side and the right hand side out of the fraction that contain the left hand side, and lift kinda adjusts confidence for chance (lift > 1 if the items are more likely to occur together than separately). I've only ever used SAS Enterprise Miner to do this in a classroom setting, but almost certainly there are other packages to do this.   In your example, I'd have your association rules be something like {C} -> {A}, {C} -> {B}, and {C} -> {A,B} and look at the strength of those."

Here is a nice Stack Exchange post on implementations for recommender systems: http://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/834/recommending-movies-with-additional-features-using-collaborative-filtering  If you just want some exploratory stuff, I would just use Python or R (or really any language) to make a list of pairs of products purchased by each user. Then do a ""group by"" to sort them in order of frequency. You will be able to see some of the biggest stuff pop out immediately. You may need to normalize for very common individual products.  For fun: one slightly creative method (kind of similar mathematically to the collaborative filtering) would be to think of each purchase as a ""sentence."" So if a purchase was ""shirt"", ""shoes"", ""hat"", you can think of this as a sentence ""shirt shoes hat"". You can then use gensim to do build a topic model to find the most common combinations of products, which would be like the ""topics."" This would be a nice, easy to interpret method for exploratory work. Tutorial here: https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/tut2.html"

Mahout is even in the process of migrating off the Hadoop MapReduce framework and onto Apache Spark, to give you an idea of how these tools fit together.  Since you're dealing with purchase data, you have implicit feedback vs. explicit e.g. 4 out of 5 stars. Both links above walk you through building a model using both explicit & implicit data.   The Mahout example will have you up and running without even having to write any code (outside of your data import/export pipeline). Fortunately Hadoop is NOT required.

The only place where webdev and data science really intersect is with databases.  Dealing with databases is a core competency for any data scientist, and some web development applications require the use of databases.  Depending on how big the organization is it's possible that the asset management website has a decently hefty database behind it.  If you're feeling ambitious you could propose some sort of d3.js visualization to go on the internal website.  Maybe something like a data dashboard.  I would caution against it since that would be pretty damn ambitious for a first year undergrad who's just getting into coding.  I know CS PhD students who struggle with getting d3 to work right.  Once you get it it makes sense but it can take a while to get there.  Anyway, I honestly wouldn't worry too much about it.  Just focus on becoming a competent coder.  During undergrad I did 3 semesters at a manufacturing consulting firm doing mostly CAD drawings and now I'm getting a PhD in CSE.

A developer there put together a neat dashboard driven by google analytics and splunk that showed the current number of users logged on, broken down by faculty, and the most active pages.

This is, of course, more of a true data science problem, rather than just a data mining problem.  Another one that could be good would be to develop a clustering model to segment your customers into different groups with descriptive names, like ""frequent small spenders,"" ""holiday splurgers"", etc. You could attempt to use Google Analytics to track which acquisition sources (like which adwords keywords) lead to which type of customer.   There are so many different projects you could do. If you are just getting started, I would recommend going with something kind of small and low-risk, like the customer clustering.

Unless it's one of a very select few, or one that I personally know quite a bit about, they all get the same perception. Doesn't matter if it's from Harvard or Coursera, it's a certificate. I have no idea what the requirements are to get into a certificate program at Harvard, but I know it's nowhere near the same thing as actually getting into a degree program at Harvard. They could accept anyone as far as I know, so to me, a certificate is a certificate is a certificate.  I would tend to give more weight to someone with a MS + certificate than someone with a BS + certificate. For better or worse, the MS to me indicates a desire and capability to learn. A BS + certificate has a much higher population of the ""I'm just trying to get an edge on this job hunt"" people than those who actually cared about, and were interested in, the material.  The best would be the double MS degree, but the difference between MS + certificate and double MS (regardless of where the second MS is from) is far less in degree than the difference between MS + certificate and BS + certificate.

To be sure, a lot of the stuff that data scientists are doing now is going to be automated. Like data munging. And thank fucking god for that. It sucks and it's a complete waste of time for someone with the skillset of a data scientist. Another idea I've seen advanced, which I would also welcome, is that data science will become more specialized - so you'll have data engineers, data analysts, etc., instead of just a jack-of-all-trades data scientist.      Things are going to change, but honestly, I find it very hard to believe that a population of very tech savvy men and women with expertise in extracting meaning from data are going to be out of a job in 10 years.

First off, it starts with a ridiculously false context, that knowledge workers such as lawyers and accountants are being automated out of a job. The source? Some guy doing a unwittingly Letterman-esque top 10 list at a conference. While automation could certainly change (or improve!) specific aspects of either field, the implied premise betrays a fundamental failure to understand what a lawyer or accountant actually does.  And I would extend that to data science. The ambiguity over what a data scientist actually is hurts things a bit, but if we are willing to agree that it's someone along the Drew Conway Venn diagram lines, the idea that data scientists are just a 15-25 year stop gap until we can build good enough systems is just as absurd as the idea that robots are going to handle our litigation.   Again, the ability to automate certain aspects of the field could happen and help, but if you've listened to the people who really know what they are talking about, data science involves far more than Ronco Rotisserie ""set it and forget"" models."

I don't think that they will be unemployed per se in 10 years, but I think companies will realize they are less valuable or needed than say a programmer (of a software company).  Hopefully I'm wrong, but this is one reason why I decided to stick with CS/programming. Yes, the higher pay is enticing (but it's what like $10,000 extra? Not worth it especially with taxes), but there is more uncertainty involved (of course with risk there is chance of greater reward)."

The best (only?) way to really get into it is to choose research questions and see them through to the end:   Identify useful or interesting question. Identify data sources. Acquire data. Transform data to suit research question. Select appropriate modelling strategy. Interpret results and adjust modelling strategy if necessary. Produce real-world insights in layman's terms.   If you're totally lost in finding a useful research question (no shame there), try some of the challenges on www.kaggle.com.

Thank you so much for your insight, I'm very curious: What ""weird"" area of datascience are you in, at the moment?  I don't mean to take anything away from Kaggle, because it's a great platform with an awesome community, but after having done a couple of problems on it, I want to avoid Kaggle. It puts me into a 'This is the problem, this is the dataset, find a way to make the best csv to get a higher score'. As much as I appreciate that it takes a lot to make a great entry, it doesn't give me the opportunity to derive RESULTS from the data, only predictions. I'd like to perhaps explore the option of a BI problem, letting me make conclusions from the data and not just crunch numbers. Any advice?"

And depending on the domain, and goal, it will be very different.  Example 1   Domain:Medical Non-profit Goal: Increase donations to non-profit Data: All donation data of 1%'ers - when they donated, what they donated to, how much, text of all non-profit marketing materials other non-profits send out, etc.. ?????: Using the above, how can you use data science to ""increase donations"" Profit: get more donations! Real life example: http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2015/pr-crowdfund-donation-strategy-051815.html   Example 2   Domain: Professional Soccer Goal: Stop Lionel Messi from scoring against you (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=603JM1adqRA) Data: All data from all matches he has played in broken down by touch, by score, by side he was playing against, and have it all hand coded down to the number of touches before he shoots, what foot he shot with, who passed to him, who were the defenders, etc.. ?????: Using the above, how can you use data science to ""stop Messi"" Profit: less points scored by Messi against your team! Real life example: http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2014/01/features/the-winning-formula   Example 3  Your turn!  Note  To the ????? bit, and more pertinent to your question about   It's not enough to throw every problem into an ANN, sometimes (read: most of the time) you need to engineer features, prune results, and really work through the problem, the data and the questions you want answering.   Even though we assume that you have any / all of the data that you want, in real life, you will not and you will have to make some choices.  In example 1 -   we could do an NLP project to identify potential donors language on twitter / facebook to see if they have crossed some threshold of ""caring about something"" to ""caring about something enough to open their wallets"". Then we can send them targeted ads / messages. we could do a clustering project to identify donors who have a propensity to re-commit to a cause after a year of no donations we could build a predictive model to ...... etc.   From this, you can see that the sky is really the limit in the type of project you do and what you think / the organization thinks is the most relevant and would be the most helpful."

Start looking now at places you want to work in ""data science"" and start getting informational interviews so you can get an idea of what's really happening and find out what those hiring managers want to see.  That will really help you determine what's of value.  You might also plug into your local ""data science"" community.

Recruiters are understandably pretty literal-minded about job requirements. If the job posting asks for a certain degree and you don't have it, then they just won't call you back.  It's better to try to get an interview through the back door, by networking (and possibly by building an online presence). If you meet the data science manager or a team member at a meetup, then you have a chance to show your true knowledge to someone who will understand. They can directly get you an inverview, even if you don't meet the ""official"" requirements.

While doing the lessons, keep style in mind, as this is (from my experience) one of the failings of the courses; because of the array of authors, there is no standard style in use, and some best practices are ignored (you should be using ""<-"" instead of ""="" for assignment).  Check out http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html for an idea of what kind of standards are used.

Another poster said it's a lot cheaper for students, and I know a lot of the content is free.  If you bang through all the classes in a month or 2, that would be fine, but then you can't go back and reference the videos (if you unsubscribe).  I'll admit there are pros:     It grades your code, which is nice, and it has more ""hands-on"" examples. It shows how to integrate different packages into your process flow   But I think you could learn these skills just by messing around with a personal project.  Like I said, there's hardly any ""depth"" to the classes.  On the other hand, I think these 3 classes from the data science specialization on Coursera will make you a better R programmer for free: 1, 2, 3.  I did subscribe to datacamp for 2 months, and I completed some classes, and tried every class.  I liked it, but some questions were wrong or poorly worded, the answer checking engine was a little buggy at times.  It felt like a beta test, and I was confused why it cost so much.  I bet there's less than an hour of video content on the whole site.    All that being said, I would gladly be a long-term subscriber at $5/month, assuming they continually add content, and make improvements to the site.

Even if I set aside the fact that the site is obviously biased towards R (heck, all their tutorials are in R), let's look at some of the shockingly bad conclusions/graphs:  But first - Repeat after me - ""Correlation does not equal causation"".   1) Most of the plots and figures are meaningless. Sure, let's compare ""R"" as a search term against ""Pandas"" because that's a completely fair comparison /sarcasm. Because obviously everyone working on Data Science in Python tags their posts with pandas on SO right?  2) Salary comparisons are also completely meaningless, and I find that especially rich after the author states earlier in the article:    Comparing adoption and popularity numbers for Python and R is not that straightforward. Since Python is used as a general-purpose language, its applications are more numerous (mainly web development) which inflates some of the numbers.    Did it perhaps occur to the authors that because Python is a general purpose language and is used across multiple areas, the salaries will also be varied and looking at a mean/median value across the entire cross-section of Python v/s R programmers would be a dumb comparison?  Do you really expect a trained Statistician who most likely has a M.S. or Ph.D. to earn the same or less than a web developer who codes in Python? The R user base is largely dominated by statisticians, academics or data scientists and of course we'd expect them to earn well compared to a much larger and varied user base in Python spanning a whole range of salaries and expertise/skill sets.  3) Perhaps the most shocking piece is this:    In addition to the figures above, other figures indicate that more people are switching from Python to R, than from R to Python   Really? I'd really love to see these figures or a citation if you're going to make general statements like that with nothing to back it up. The only figure copy pasted from the equally terrible KDNuggets infographic shows 18% of Python users switched to R but 26% of R users switched to Python. How that equates to more Python users switching is anyone's guess :-/.  http://blog.dominodatalab.com/content/images/2015/06/RvsPython.png  Would seem to indicate that R popularity dropped in 2015 just as Python saw an increase. Taking a page out of the author's book, I could easily claim - ""The figure clearly shows that people are switching to Python from R"", but I know better than to draw bad conclusions from random correlations ;-)  I'll get off my soapbox now. Frankly, I'd be skeptical of trying to learn anything from a site that applies so little rigor in analyzing data and drawing conclusions."

There was a mathematician with a PhD at my interview who failed because he didn't know any SQL or programming beyond simple scripting.

I would imagine that it's because people just aren't familiar with what a RAship entails. They don't know that everything done has to be approved by a professor prior to going out. Even when I explained that to recruiters/hiring managers, they still weren't impressed.  Frankly, I think that it's sour grapes."

datascience,38a2bk,fortyninerbruin,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:59:49 2015 UTC,"So you have a PhD and a dissertation, and you say all of that is worthless, meaning you could've had a bachelors or a masters and you would be just as valuable?   That seems very dubious since many data science positions specifically seek PhDs."
datascience,38a2bk,dopadelic,3,Thu Jun 4 06:02:28 2015 UTC,"That's not what I said at all on several counts. (I did say that it's definitely worthwhile above and that I 100% disagree with industry.)  You're asking about work experience. Employers I've interviewed with and worked for see stipend work as part of the education side of the resume, rather than work experience. They think they know more about stat/analysis/BI/etc. because they have more years of experience doing real world work than tenured faculty at the university. Nevermind the fact that we tend to have more degrees and certifications than they have had individual classes in the area.  In many cases, these same people didn't know stuff taught in the first week of class/training. Very fundamental stuff...  I don't have the same level of exposure to DS as I do in the more traditional stat/BI career paths, but from what I've seen and experienced, the same sentiment is there though not as extreme. You are still going to have to make it past the HR filter (assuming that the companies have HR departments). Work experience in industry is going to beat work experience for a stipend.   I am a firm believer in training, education, and certifications over real world experience as far as making you better at whatever you do. However, your objective function is wrong. Instead of maximizing what would give you the best experience, you should be worrying about what will improve your chances at finding jobs."

datascience,386zn7,chimneyscout,2,Tue Jun 2 08:25:04 2015 UTC,"Strictly speaking, you probably don't have to be great at math to be a data scientist. Personally, I don't think about multivariable calculus very much at all in my job. However, being great at math gives you a lot of context and ideas, and it also makes it much easier to learn new machine-learning algorithms. I have a background in math, and I often do think about probabilitytheory and linear algebra. You have two general options:   Spend a few months to a year learning lots of math, especially linear algebra and probability theory. Use this base knowledge to pick up some statistics.   OR    Focus very specifically on job-related skills. For example, if you are using Python, learn scikit-learn, numpy, scipy, and pandas. Along the way, you may find that you need to pick up some math to really understand these libraries. Then pick up exactly the math you need to know. Use your knowledge of these Python libraries to do a few real-world projects or Kaggle competitions, and document or blog about your work.    I spent a lot of time studying math before doing any machine learning, and I do think it gives me some advantages. However, I recommend that you focus on Option 2. It's definitely the faster way to a job, and it will also give you a lot more context when you go learn the math you really need to know.   Let me know if you have any questions, and feel free to PM me."
datascience,386zn7,will-stanton,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:47:24 2015 UTC,"It definitely seems a good idea to mix both. Clearly rehashing maths knowledge helps me with programming challenges and digesting more difficult material seems also easier.  Getting a job is not top priority now. I want to get a good intuitive grasp of what's going on, hopefully a couple of years from now?  I have some books to help me: INTRODUCTION TO THE THEORY OF STATISTICS. Wonder if it's not too hardcore for a beginner? In addition, I have some undergrad maths preparation course books. It will probably take me about 6 to 12 moths to go through both. I will try to mix and match it with some MOOC courses to get some practical knowledge."

datascience,384vdc,PoachYellowElephants,0,Wed Jun 3 14:11:41 2015 UTC,"Definitely a good plan. I'm a DS recruiter (only DS, not even tangential stuff like data engineering or even predictive analytics), and when people ask me what degree they should pursue, this is my answer (one in stats, another in CS), but usually that's kind of a ""best case scenario"" answer - by the time someone is asking me about it, they're usually too late in their education/career to position themselves so well from the get go... Or maybe they have either a Stats/CS degree already but refuse to acknowledge that the best path is to learn another discipline. Usually CS grads are worse about this than Stats people: ie. I talk to a lot of programmers who are extremely analytically/statistically weak who try to argue that they learned a lot of analytics as part of their CS degree and could jump into a DS job even though they've barely ever touched a predictive model. Stats guys/gals at least are usually more self-aware when it comes to limitations and don't think they could just ""pick up"" programming on the job as a DS.    I agree with your reasoning when it comes to the order. That's the order I would go, but I also enjoy CS much more."

Then possibly pursuing a masters in either stats or data science? Assuming might as well get data science masters. Thanks for any input. I'm mid way through undergrad for electrical engineering but am seriously considering a switch to either CS or like I stated my university is now offering data science.

You won't get a data science position without proof of proficiency (in lieu of a more relevant degree) which means you'll need to do a lot project work and make a portfolio of sorts. However, you're at a major disadvantage to other candidates. Most have Masters and many PhDs anyway."

datascience,37zsu2,Squoobles,6,Sun May 31 22:20:40 2015 UTC,"I've discussed this with people before. Working in an field that requires an advanced degree is a testament to that field and not mechanism for filtering CVs like undergrads. There are people who can bridge the knowledge gap themselves, but very few. NASA wouldn't employ a rocket scientist without a PhD in rocket science. You wouldn't go to a doctor unless they had the proper qualifications. Data Science is an advanced field. Lot's of people won't agree with me, but I think this is a sensible point.   As a disclaimer though, I'm completing an undergrad in quantitative finance and have secured a role in the industry, but I will pursue a higher degree in time because I know I don't know enough!"

datascience,37zsu2,cYzzie,1 point,Wed Jun 3 08:06:26 2015 UTC,they are if you have abd can prove the skill level. thats just simply hard to obtain without a good education in most cases
datascience,37zsu2,LetsGoHawks,2,Sun May 31 23:13:17 2015 UTC,"For data & business analyst positions, a degree in a financial field will be a big plus. I wish I had one, because it shows up a lot. Go to Indeed.com or Dice.com and start doing some searches for Data/Business Analyst jobs in your area and read up on what skills they're looking for.  SPOILER: In no particular order: Excel/VBA, Java, Python, R, SAS, SQL. Make sure your Excel skills are really strong. Including building reports.  Know how to read and write data from common sources (data bases, XML files, JSON files, CSV), get used to cleaning it up and organizing it. r/datasets has a lot of places you can pull data, work with all types."
datascience,37zsu2,will-stanton,2,Sun May 31 23:18:36 2015 UTC,"There are two main paths that I could see you taking:   Become a data analyst or business analyst. You probably already have most of the skills for this, and your accounting background could be a big plus. You can utilize some stats and make lots of complex spreadsheet programs. This would typically not involve a lot of programming (except possibly some VBA and some basic database stuff), but could be super interesting and lucrative. The positioning here is that you understand business, but you can also wrangle data. This is the path of least resistance and could lead to a rewarding career. Another option is to boost your programming, stats, and machine learning skills, and go for a true data scientist position. You would need to learn R or Python, machine learning, and some big data skills. I have a couple of posts about it on my blog if you are interested: http://will-stanton.com/how-do-i-get-my-first-job-in-data-science/ and http://will-stanton.com/becoming-an-effective-data-hacker/   Let me know if you have any other questions."
datascience,37zsu2,will-stanton,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:33:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, I'd probably be more inclined to follow option 1 as it seems like a smoother transition.

datascience,37zsu2,greatluck,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:34:56 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! There are tons of resources for this kind of work, maybe too many. I would focus on trying to do some real-life projects and documenting your work. This is the quickest way to competency, and it will also reveal the skills you are missing. Try a topic you are interested in. For example, download some historical baseball data and make some interesting graphs about some surprising facts. Then make a visualization and post in on /r/dataisbeautiful. If you are ambitious, you can pick up some R programming and build a Shiny app. The technology is probably a little less important than your ability to prove that you can be creative and communicate about data."
datascience,37zsu2,RRFFBz,2,Tue Jun 2 13:52:08 2015 UTC,"As others said you'd be at a disadvantage compared to others that have either an advanced quantitative degree or a CS or stats degree.  I know because I'm in the same boat: accounting graduate who wants to transition into data science.  I'm lucky enough that I was able to find a series of non-accounting roles within my current employer where I can develop the skills I will need: I currently work as a CRM data analyst using a lot of SQL, SAS and Excel.  On my own time I have used online resources to learn Python and machine learning.  It's a lot of work but hopefully it will pay off in the end."

datascience,37xnlx,biobossx99,2,Sun May 31 06:47:16 2015 UTC,Depends how much time you haveavailable. What do you get with the subscription that you don't get with the free account right now? Everything that I see is free on datacamp for now that I have been doing. For reference I've gone through the first two full guides in about 8 hours of work which is about what was estimated.
datascience,37xnlx,xen0cide,1 point,Sun May 31 16:28:26 2015 UTC,I see.  I'll be doing close to full time on a project.  I'll probably use the estimated time.
datascience,37xnlx,paerb,2,Sun May 31 19:37:21 2015 UTC,"I have not completed (nor attempted) all of the courses, but the ones I did go through were relatively well done. The only thing that bugged me, and this is obviously just nit-picking, was the lack of style integrity. For someone just learning, switching between ""="" and ""<-"" for assignment might end up being confusing, but that was my only real criticism. Admittedly, different courses were created by different authors.  Also: Students can take advantage of a $9/month subscription."

In all, if you're totally new to R it's great, purchase the subscription, you'll learn loads and what's more important, you'll be taught the current best practices like maggrittr, dplyr, r markdown and ggvis. The pros of this are you'll be more proficient, quicker however you might miss/skip much of the base code syntax and functions that you probably require down the line.   If you already knew some R (or lots), it can be a bit tiresome going through the entire course. Anyway I definitely reccomend - the DataCamp team have created some great courseware."

It is not true that everyone has data science skills nowadays. A lot of people claim to have them, but most people cannot back up their claims with demonstrated experience. An ideal resume would have the relevant skills (R or Python, big data technologies, machine learning, stats) and some real-life experience or independent projects where you actually used those skills.

The most important thing is to do the projects, be able to talk about them, and include them on your resume.

We actually chatted around the second week of May (I'm a DS recruiter, though I don't want to broadcast my name for a few reasons). Great post; I may save that for a quick reference for candidates who aren't ready for market yet if that's alright with you!    Anyway, I'm surprised you don't mention a more general coding language under base skills. I usually say that the best way to start your DS toolkit is becoming extremely well versed in R and at least intermediate in Python and SQL then add in experience working with Hadoop (usually working with queries in Pig, Hive, etc. is sufficient unless you're looking for a more data engineer/architect/ETL job). Do you consider that to be overkill? IMO the generalized coding language is one of the big dividing lines between an analytics person and a DS.    PS. You open to relocation yet, buddy? :P"
datascience,37t4pr,dreyco,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:48:48 2015 UTC,"Good point /u/PoachYellowElephants. I think a general coding base is helpful, and even necessary for a lot of data scientist roles. I think there are at least a few levels of ""data science"" jobs, and they largely split out based on programming skills. There are a decent number of people with the job title ""data scientist"" who aren't great programmers, but it is a little controversial if they are ""real"" data scientists. I agree that most people with the job title data scientist are decent general programmers, but there are a lot of people doing ""data science-y"" work who are not good programmers at all. They usually have the title Data Analyst, though."
datascience,37rjf5,zerostyle,17,Fri May 29 20:32:10 2015 UTC,"Do you need to be a rockstar programmer? Probably not.  Do you need to be able to code effectively? Absolutely.  On the coding side, I think most people get frustrated with code. The good part is that solving something is satisfying to you. However, you need to be able to take in data, structure it, clean it, analyze it, and visualize it. If you can't do that, you are going to have problems. You can learn it though and the more you immerse yourself in it, the more you will be comfortable with it.  On top of that, you need to understand statistics. You need to enjoy finding trends in large amounts of seemingly non-trending data. You need to be good at explaining technical things to non-technical people. It isn't as simple as ""Do you know how to code?"" If that were the case, someone looking for a data scientist would just need to find a good programmer.   My advice to you (which may differ from the next person) is to jump in and try some machine learning. Do a Kaggle competition (but don't compare yourself to the top of the leaderboard or you will cry). Start a Github profile and upload your code. Go find and study the vast amount of literature and videos (MIT Opencourseware has a fantastic one) out there.   It isn't going to be easy. There is a reason why a decent portion of data scientists have Masters and PhDs. However, if it is what you want, go for it."
datascience,37rjf5,apollobanana,2,Fri May 29 21:47:19 2015 UTC,"As stated I have super limited knowledge of CS right now, and suspect that any kind of challenge would be way out of my limits.  Maybe I'm wrong and just doubting myself.  I love the idea of data science, finding hidden trends, etc.  I'm just not sure if I'm capable of it.  Stats, for example, was fascinating to me, but difficult."

But you learn from it. You said you can do loops and arrays. I am guessing that you can do can do conditional statements (i.e. ""if""). Go make something. By the time you are finished, you will probably look at your code and say ""I could have done that better"". Well...then you go and do it better.   I don't think stats is really ""easy"" for most people. You don't need to be a stats phenom.   Think of data science as really close to academia in a lot of respects. You have to want to learn. There are super smart people coming up with cool algorithms all the time and you need to want to figure out how they work.   There is no reason why you are not ""capable"".

datascience,37rjf5,griffin3141,2,Fri May 29 22:20:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it sounds like the gulf is too big to bridge given your background. A good data scientist will need a very solid understanding of probability and statistics (for which one really needs calculus and linear algebra) - several courses worth with some real-world applied experience to boot. In addition one needs decent CS skills - it's a specialized set of skills, but you will need to have a solid enough understanding of algorithms to understand the distributed implementations. Now, there are a lot of ""analytics"" tools coming out which provide out-of-the-box implementations, but you'll still need to know how to do the data cleaning work.

There are tons of data analysts out there who are not great programmers, but who have great hacking skills and great business knowledge. Lots of them are extremely successful. But to work effectively with data, you at least need to be able to hack together an R or SAS script to do something you can't do in Excel.  If you want to do ""big data"" or  hardcore data science, that usually means that you need to be able program decently well (typically in Python). The really hardcore data science jobs usually involve building high-performance machine-learning models that can be put in production.  I used to be a poor programmer, and I was still able to contribute a lot to the business, because I could hack. I have since transitioned to more programming-heavy work. If you have any questions, feel free to PM me."

datascience,37lp8f,dtelad11,5,Thu May 28 15:14:27 2015 UTC,"Definitely an interesting perspective. I'm not sure exactly what he's trying to say with this:     It was disappointingly easy and expensive ($13k per semester for 5 semesters for an online program). The level of comprehension required to do well was about that of a Coursera course. And this is not to say that Coursera is easy; it isn't if you really dig your heels in.     He says that the Berkeley program was disappointingly easy, about the same as a Coursera course, but then says that Coursera isn't easy if you really commit. Does he mean that the Berkeley program is as easy as a Coursera course that one isn't very committed to? Or does he mean that because you can commit to Coursera and get the same level of challenge for free (at your own, potentially faster, pace), it doesn't make sense to go through a paid program?    I think he's ignoring or underplaying some key factors. First, a kind of minor thing:     There is a higher level of accountability that comes with a structured program, but the incremental learning that came with the structure didn't make the degree worth it.     That accountability and structure is very important for a lot of people. He mentions those factors in a sort of throwaway clause and then immediately says they're not worth it. Hopefully most people know themselves well enough to anticipate how much structure they need to keep on track, but the way he presented it is a bit one-sided.    The main issue that he doesn't address is marketability. This guy has a very quantitative degree from The Wharton School that he used to land a few years of data-centric work experience at solid companies. He has the opportunity to pick up projects at his current positions at San Fran tech companies, and so even though he's learning independently, he's already has a network to draw from and (I'm assuming) access to potential mentors and job connections.    More importantly, he has a platform to prove that he actually has the skills despite not getting a formal degree. Even if you are extremely dedicated and push yourself to learn more independently than you could over the same period of time in a traditional program, it's very hard to convince employers of that fact. Some of the most passionate and clearly intelligent candidates I've worked with decided to go the independent route, and because of their intellect and drive, they built amazing skills on their own. However, these people are not picked up on by hiring managers. There are a few situations where they'll occasionally get some interest:     Like this guy, they are currently employed at a reputable company in the DS/analytics space that has allowed them to start applying their new skills in some way. (these candidates still have an incredibly hard time even getting initial phone screens) They already have an advanced degree in a quantitative field and were taking Coursera courses or doing independent studying/projects to put the finishing touches on their DS skillset.   Basically, if you're already on the cusp of being a marketable DS, independent learning can help push you in the right direction. But it is no substitute for a formal degree, and you'll need to have a very very strong resume in every other respect. I've placed one candidate who only had a Bachelor's (Econ) and he had graduated college at 19 and was hired out of undergrad at a National Lab that let him apply more and more advanced skills as he learned them independently. Because he was an exceptional genius who stood out in a major way, he got hired in a great DS job at an industry-leading firm. But his salary still suffered. And I know he still plans on getting his masters in the next few years because of all the difficulty he faced.    I know another candidate who has dual quantitative undergrad degrees from a top-tier school, a business certificate from an Ivy League University, 2 years of advanced analytical consulting experience at a big name firm, and is a very successful independent investor who put himself through school with his earnings and is currently self-employed... Know what he's doing now? The Berkeley program. Why? Because he needed to formalize his education - even with a lot of impressive things going for him, it became clear over a couple of years that not having a Masters degree was holding him back significantly.    Is it fair? Does it make sense? Probably not. Is it kind of a scam that simply shelling out the money for a degree will make that big of a difference vs. learning on your own? Yeah. But that's the reality of the market. I can't even count how many lengthy referrals I've sent out for brilliant candidates will less traditional backgrounds, I've had long phone calls with hiring managers trying to push back and get them to be a little more open-minded when a truly talented individual comes up. It almost never works. Keep this in mind. An advanced degree is worth a lot, especially from a school like Berkeley. It's not a bad program either. I don't doubt for a second that it's possible to independently learn more in less time if you're motivated, but it does give you a solid knowledge base as well as a formal degree.    Learning more skills or learning them more quickly isn't worth forgoing a grad degree. The grad degree and decent skills will get you hired."

Plus, it legitimately doesn't seem to be terrible, even if it's imperfect and overpriced. It still seems like it's much more on the right track than most programs out there. Does it have a really bad reputation in the Bay Area DS community?    Have you spoken with them at all, or have they just attempted to get a hold of you every day for 2 weeks? It's much more suspect and desperate if you've talked to them and they're still hounding you.

datascience,37ijji,Watchestelltime,11,Wed May 27 21:59:42 2015 UTC,"Right, like I'm going to tell you where I get all my clients.   In seriousness, I've found that 40% of the offers are for university cheating (do my assignment), 30% are for personal projects with a small budget/unclear goals/unreasonably short deadlines, and the rest are interesting projects that can be accomplished in a straightforward manner without too much trouble along the way.   The first group I refuse to deal with and have strung prospective clients along until they reveal their course code, at which point I report them to their TA/lecturer.   The second group tends to sneak up on people; scope creep, 'could you just do this too?', 'I need this entirely non-critical work done in a week rather than 3'. These are typically too low paying to really commit to extending frequently, and there's a reasonable risk that you won't get paid at all if you disagree too much.   The last group is rewarding work, and can potentially bring in rates above the time you actually spend on the work if you're good at it, you'll potentially get repeat clients here, and can eventually raise your rates once things get going. Finding these jewels in the rough can itself take up a considerable amount of time at the start. At the point I'm at now, with a moderate reputation and history, they tend to come to me. That takes time. If you're just looking for a few quick bucks you'll be stuck with the second group most of the time.   My advice; learn a language well enough that you are able to do just about anything with it. Have a look at the common projects being asked for in that language and try to mesh gears with the market. Treat people, and yourself, with respect and get a good reputation up.  Personally, I got really good at R, Python, PHP, MySQL/SQLite. Most of my work comes from R."

That description sounds typical; the sort of thing you might expect a business to invest a few tens of thousands of dollars in researching and constructing, except for a fraction of the cost/time (and in the end, quality and applicability).  It could be a business looking for an in-principle proof of concept, or a personal project, or a university project that they'll hand in themselves. Talking to clients before signing on is where the critical assessment of which of these things is true occurs.   Maybe you can analyse the data somehow in the time/budget. Depends on what they want.   My biggest hatred was when clients not only wanted the analysis done, but the software that does it. Trying to install R and specific packages on their machines via chat-window messaging is a nightmare. Oh god, then debugging their machines <shudder>."

How do you tweak level design to keep people playing? What makes people more engaged and likely to pull their friends on board, etc.    To orient yourself towards becoming a highly marketable Data Scientist, definitely research programs that give you some legit project experience with unstructured data and predictive analytics with a business focus. I would find a program where you can:     Learn how to perform predictive analytics using advanced statistics and/or machine learning algorithms (most marketable tools: R and Python) Learn how to clean, transform, and mine data, including unstructured and/or streaming data, and get it into a form that you can analyze with the methods above (preferred tools: Python, advanced SQL, Hadoop/Hive/Pig, AWS) Work on projects where you start with said unruly data and pull out actionable business insights, doing the whole thing soup-to-nuts on your own Get connected with internships and make good industry connections. This will make an incredible difference in your ability to snag a job. If the project experience that I mentioned in the last point comes from an internship, you're golden   You'll probably have to get a graduate degree in order to really snag a top-tier DS job, since the vast majority of practicing DS have at least a Masters. You're getting started early, so if you don't feel like grad school is for you, definitely get involved in local DS communities, do Kaggle competitions, do Data Science projects like I described above in your free time!

They must be the people with jobs in big pharma or big banking that just don't have other options.   This is my fav quote from the article that echoes my thoughts exactly: ""R hands down. SAS is for boring dinosaurs. Note: I have used both extensively. One of the main requirements of me switching jobs last year was to not use SAS anymore. SAS will die a slow, painful death. No tech company/startup in their right mind uses SAS and that is where the future is going (not to mention where the more exciting work is)."""

I live 15 minutes from SAS headquarters and one of the largest biotech hubs in the world. Between the CRO's, the pharma companies themselves, the health insurance companies, and the large tech companies (Lenovo, SAS itself, etc), I can tell you that knowing SAS is still a very valuable skill. NCSU even has an advanced analytics masters program completely built around SAS (and they have ZERO trouble getting their students placed into very well paying jobs year after year). If I have a choice then I'm 100% working in R. I enjoy Python, and Julia has piqued my curiosity, but being good at SAS is what gets me a constant stream of unsolicited job offers. I do think that SAS and its counterparts (STATA, SPSS, Maple, MATLAB, etc.) will face some difficulties as the adoption of open source statistical packages increases. That said, they will ALWAYS have a place in businesses who can afford (which is many) and rely on stable statistical software. The majority of the companies currently using SAS in production systems are unlikely to ever switch to something that is open source. The two big reasons are 1) legacy code, 2) when shit goes wrong, you can't just call up R and say ""fix it"". If you are relying on a non-base package you have zero guarantees that it will work in the future nor can you expect support of any kind (you may get it, but you certainly can't rely on it). With expensive commercial software you can realistically expect that the software will be supported fully in the future, bugs will be stomped out in a somewhat timely manner, and support will alway be available even if it isn't cheap.

I don't disagree - there are enough companies out there that are using SAS (and will continue to use it for the foreseeable future) where you'll be able to get solid jobs as a skilled SAS programmer.    However I think in the Data Science space specifically, open source solutions are much more marketable. Every here and there I have a Data Science role that requests SAS, and I've seen probably 2 companies in the last year who have required it. On the other hand, the majority of the DS roles I work on either strongly favor or flat-out require R and Python.    The opposite goes for our Predictive Analytics recruiting team. Nearly every one of their roles requires SAS. However, they're doing more traditional analytics in more rigid companies, and the pay is significantly lower than Data Science positions.    Mean base salary for individual contributors is $95K for predictive analytics professionals, $120K for DS. For managers, the mean base is $145K for PAPs and $170K for DS. (2015 Salary Study)     The majority of the companies currently using SAS in production systems are unlikely to ever switch to something that is open source.     I think it's more likely than you think. I have a handful of clients in the insurance and financial services industries, and they're working to transition off of SAS - or at the very least they're building Data Science teams that are moving away from SAS. Finance is certainly behind, but they're starting to make moves. The healthcare side of things is even further behind, and maybe they'll stay behind, but it'll be interesting to see what happens going forward.    TL;DR: SAS is still alive and well, but since this is the Data Science sub, it's worth mentioning that it's not very popular for positions doing the most cutting-edge Data Science work."

Gender serves as the least logical of the predictor variables, as no tool use or other factors explain the gap in pay – there seems no justification for the gender gap in the survey results.   A common retort to the claim of the existence of a significant gender pay gap in the US is that the most frequently cited report did not compare wage across similar positions, but average wage in general. The O'Reilly report made an effort to control for geography, age, experience, and skillset (using tool familiarity as a proxy) and still found a significant pay gap."

Even the professionals who are currently employed in an official ""Data Scientist"" position are nothing more than over-titled quants a good 1/3 of the time.    Read with a discerning eye, this study makes some interesting points - it hints at what tools are actually used by Data Scientists and how that can affect salary.     When looking at the Clusters and how they fit into the regression model we built from the data, we see respondents in Cluster 1 (Proprietary Analytics), with slightly lower salaries, while respondents in Cluster 2 (Hadoop Ecosystem) and Cluster 3 (Data Science) with slightly higher salaries relative to the mean.

datascience,37cse3,PoachYellowElephants,2,Wed May 27 12:45:04 2015 UTC,"Of course, I'm more than happy to define! A Data Scientist is a Predictive Analytics Professional who can derive actionable insights from massive amounts (ideally terabytes+) of unstructured and/or streaming data. Without the aid of Data Engineers, Predictive Modelers, ETL programmers, etc. they can tackle nearly any data source using custom code and their own utilities. They can approach unprecedented data sets because they can build solutions from the ground-up, and they have the combination of analytical chops and business acumen needed to identify the potential value in any available data and then extract that value.    My clients often don't know what Data Scientists are. Half of the ""Data Science"" jobs that we're approached about end up going to our Predictive Analytics team. Predictive Analytics has been around for a long time, but we're seeing a lot of roles that are erroneously labeled as Data Science even though they aren't anything new. And those roles tend to have much different salary bands and requirements (eg. a position that pays up to $80K and is open to MBAs).

datascience,37ajyz,flipstables,6,Tue May 26 05:40:58 2015 UTC,"Great questions.    Background? Education, training (formal and informal)? Previous careers if you had any?   I should have better anticipated this question in the original post and given some context. Well, a lot of that information can be found in my resume on my website, but let me give a quick summary. I started college at the Ohio State University as a microbiologist thinking I'd maybe go to medical school but later switched to chemistry because I liked it more. I have a PhD in computational quantum chemistry from the Ohio State University. I then held a postdoc jointly at Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago, still as a quantum chemist. During that time, I became disenchanted with academia and my career prospects there, so I transitioned into the tech industry by becoming a back-end web developer at a startup in Chicago called Signal. That was my last gig before becoming a big data engineer. Aside from my formal education, I have taken a number of online classes for the past 3 or 4 years from Coursera and Udacity, including the data science track (which I didn't actually complete) and machine learning. I have only ever taken one class on programming when I was an undergrad, but it was a total throw-away class. I have taught myself to program by reading books, doing tutorials, and forcing myself to use it during work.   Pitfalls? Did you spend time learning something un-useful? Spinning your wheels on tech that's not really applicable?   Ha, yeah, pretty much all my PhD research. But not entirely. I really learned a lot of tricky math, programming, and algorithms then which are transferrable skills. Quantum chemistry makes some of these machine learning topics look like baby stuff, though not all. I'm certainly no expert on advanced neural networks techniques, for instance, but none of the math behind it scares me. Also, I recognize that having the PhD has opened new doors for me. It has also trained me to know how to conduct scientific research and present complicated topics concisely (written and spoken). It has also humbled me a lot. I have rubbed elbows with some extraordinarily smart individuals that I will never measure up against. It's a great way to become afflicted with impostor syndrome.  Beside lamenting about grad school and academia, yeah, there are some other things I don't think helped me land a job. One thing that comes to mind is going to certain Meetups. I went to a couple data science related ones thinking, oh maybe I can network here and meet people like me. Meh. Some of the Meetups I attended might as well as have been relabeled ""Let's make graphs club"" or ""Political science majors with laptops"". Nothing really about learning data science techniques, programming, ML, etc. Also, these Meetups seemed to attract people who were overbearingly extroverted, which is something that tends to turn me off. I had very different expectations. That said, the best Meetups I attended, which were not a waste of time, were really about databases, where there was a cool mix of devops, back-end devs, and data scientist-types. Presentations were technical and deep. Plus these Meetups had free beer. Maybe other people have had better success with Meetups than me. I am pretty hesitant to attend them now. I think more traditional conferences are much better for exchanging ideas and meeting people.  For pitfalls more related to job searching, though, I would say beware of recruiters. I have had reasonable success having real recruiters find me on LinkedIn or through my website. In fact, that's how Apple got in touch with me. But the vast majority of things I get contacted about are noise. I admit it's encouraging to have somebody out of the blue ask if I want a job. Makes me feel valuable (more so than I did in academia). Having been in Chicago, I got a lot of slimy recruiters from the finance industry that I just plain wasn't interested in. It's a red flag when the recruiter doesn't tell you from the get go what company they are recruiting for until you give them your email and resume. Just avoid that. It's predatory recruiting.  I feel like there are other things I could gripe about, but I will stop there.   Most important topics? Technology/stacks/languages/concepts/etc?   Hmm, well, for landing the job and making the transition, I certainly had to know how to program. Every interview I had involved some degree of programming and algorithms skills questions. I highly recommend reviewing that kind of thing because, at least in my experience, most of the people interviewing me were not data scientists but were software engineers, even at big companies. If the majority of your interviewers are software engineers, you should know the basics of software engineering. Besides, you are going to be working with these people. You want them to respect you. So, yeah, programming is way more important for interviews than knowing the details about how support vector machines work. Second most important, in my opinion, is basic statistics. And I mean really basic stuff, like describing/applying mean, median, mode, probability, confidence intervals, p-values, Bayes theorem.  As for technology, I think it depends largely on the company. Generally, it seems that R and Python are the favorites of data science. But I don't think R or Python (or both) alone will get you a job. I personally have a background in scientific computing, so I have a good amount of experience with C, C++, and Fortran. Later I picked up Python. And I know Unix/Linux pretty well. As a back-end dev, I learned some serious Java. And, since working with the web, I know a fair amount of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I know how to write HTTP RESTful services/APIs. I also know about SQL and NoSQL databases. I think all of these things are important in different contexts. I mean, I don't really know any Microsoft stack stuff, and so I didn't get any interviews with companies who use that kind of tech stack. If I have to boil it down to a nugget of advice for looking appealing for jobs, I would say you need to know R and/or Python for scripting, a traditional workhorse language like C++ or Java, and basic SQL and a little about at least one NoSQL database. That's on top of all the stats and math and so forth. So, yeah, there's a lot to know. And believe me, I don't know all of these things perfectly. If you read my blog post, you'll have noticed that I failed quite a few times at these interviews. So it goes."

datascience,37ajyz,flipstables,1 point,Tue May 26 17:17:46 2015 UTC,"I don't really know at what point one masters certain technologies. I feel comfortable with the things I listed to varying degrees. I've been programming for over 8 years in different languages at different times. After a while, you just learn to carry the same concepts from one language into another and it just becomes learning the syntax. The language I'm most comfortable with currently is Java. Python second. But overall, I have spent the most time with C++. I'm just rusty with C++ because it hasn't been the language of choice for the work I've been doing. Fortran, I used to be familiar with, but now I don't think I can even write hello world in it. Ha! HTML and CSS are kind of not full fledged languages. You just kind of pick them up. JavaScript is an oddball for me because it has the C-like syntax I'm used to, but it also has some funkiness that I just haven't perfected yet, like closures or front-end wizardry or fancy node.js features or the coolest way to express a functional programming loop. R I am okay with. It actually feels a lot like JavaScript in some ways to me. With R, I kind of use it largely for quick data exploration and black box methods. It's handy like that. I just haven't used it a lot for major production-level analyses that eat up all my computer RAM. As for databases, I never really used one until I became a back-end web dev. (I learned about them beforehand, though) Then, it was all about learning the gist of SQL and some NoSQL concepts. Database query languages are not especially hard, in my opinion, but maybe using them effectively is. The thing is, I have never taken formal classes on any of these, with the exception of a cushy programming for science class in undergrad where we pretty much learned how to write a for loop in Java, nothing serious. I've pretty much learned how to program from books, tutorials, and reading documentation.   As for math, I did up through vector calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and numerical analysis. Anything else, I learned in reading books for chemistry and physics or online."

Yeah, I am not a expert on super advanced stats nor have I taken advanced stats classes (unless you consider some online ML classes in that category), but it's not like having a grad level stats class on your resume is going to get you hired anyway. For phone and in person interviews, you're going to get asked fairly straightforward stats problems that can be solved in a few minutes because that's all the time you have. It's like getting asked to program fizzbuzz or to reverse a string in place. If you can't do those, you are probably a bad programmer. I think the simple stats stuff is the same style question. Some interviewers like to pitch you meatball questions to get you warmed up. Assuming you knock those out of the park, you can move on to the meaty open-ended questions where you can maybe then start to suggest using advanced stats or ML or whatever else. This happened to me. But, again, you aren't even going to be asked that question if you have a hard time computing/interpreting simple probabilities. So, cover the basics and then go on to impress with advanced incantations if you know them. At least that's what I think."

datascience,37ajyz,srkiboy83,2,Tue May 26 05:46:56 2015 UTC,"Well, it's only been a few weeks so far. Maybe I can better answer this in a few months. For now, at least, my time is devoted to helping to build out a data pipeline so that in the future my team and others can more simply access and analyze our data for research and/or business purposes. Without going into specifics, the system involves a variety of components like what you mention. Some big batch processing with map-reduce, some big NoSQL database, some front-end services for viz and querying. Once our pipeline is more complete, there are more ML-style and analysis projects coming up. One project at a time."
datascience,37ajyz,cs1b,3,Tue May 26 15:48:56 2015 UTC,"Hi,  Congrats on the new job. From what you describe, this is exactly where I want to go. My master studies in computer science were mostly about AI/Data Science (with clustering, classification and such). My knowledge is pretty basic at this point of time because I've been working in web dev the last two years. Can you provide some insights on how to teach yourself the needed knowledge? I plan doing the MIT Data Analysis course on EDx and then from there develop a deeper knowledge in statistics."
datascience,37ajyz,ewrewr1,2,Tue May 26 05:49:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Sounds cool that you are wanting to go a similar route as I have. Truthfully, if you have a background in AI/Data Science as part of your masters degree, you will be in a better standing than me. I am a quantum chemist by training, and I strive to highlight the aspects of that research and experience that I think have to do with data science/engineering, not always with much success. I have been fortunate enough to have worked as a back-end web dev for the past 1.5 years, where I picked up a lot of new experience that I could more easily tie to data science. So, maybe you can do the same? Whenever I described my job as a back-end dev on my resume or LinkedIn or to people, I would avoid listing the mundane stuff that any old dev would do. Instead, I highlighted the special projects and personal work I did that related more to data science. Sure, I built a model around FFT for predicting future web traffic, but I only did that for about a week at my job as a special hack project. But that's way more interesting and applicable to what I want to be doing! Tailoring your resume and the way you present yourself, I have found, is extremely important. A piece of advice that was once given to me which I have found very useful is to look like you already have the job you are applying for. So, for me, this is why I stressed the data science-y aspects of what I did, even if it wasn't what I always did. Of course, don't lie. You will be sniffed out quickly if you do. Find that right balance of just enough pepper on something to not be dishonest but still make it attractive. Outside of that, I also did some online classes through Coursera and Udacity to try to brush up on some ML/stats/data science topics that I wasn't especially familiar with. These helped but they were also kind of too easy. I don't think anyone would just look at me having taken some of these classes and hired me just for taking them. I view them as just a little icing on the cake, showing that I have personal motivation outside of work to learn these things. So, yeah, do that EDx class, but I wouldn't view them to be the key to a new job on their own. I think your masters experience will carry more weight. Beyond that, keep sharp on programming. I mentioned it elsewhere in this thread, but most of my interviews were still software engineer style interviews because they wanted to make sure I knew how to program, not just run a CSV file through R. To me, I think it is actually a good sign that a company wants to hire you for your programming ability in addition to your stats/data science ability. If it were just the latter (which I did encounter in my experience), then the job is probably not that great, more like a boring business analyst position. Anyhow, from your short blurb, it sounds like you are well poised to make the transition into the data science field. Good luck out there!"

My coding is surely not the problem, it's rather my inexperience in real world data science. I will try to follow the advice on resume tuning and apply for some jobs in fall and see what happens. My hopes for the EDx class are refreshing of ancient knowledge and see some nice applications to real world data."
datascience,37ajyz,turbo_dude,3,Tue May 26 17:46:01 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! I hear you on how time consuming interviewing is. Now that you're in a data science role, do you get to use much statistics or other mathematical or computational techniques? My background is in AI and statistical learning, but my job mostly requires investigating what to count, counting it, then maybe productionizing a metric for it. Many of my colleagues have a similar background and also don't get to use much of what they studied."
datascience,37ajyz,turbo_dude,4,Tue May 26 06:40:28 2015 UTC,"do you get to use much statistics or other mathematical or computational techniques?   Yes and no. I am working with more mathematical techniques than in my previous job as a back-end web dev, but it's nowhere near the level of my grad school research. Yeah, I also do a lot of glorified counting, but it seems to be pretty important. Sounds a bit similar to your situation.   Many of my colleagues have a similar background and also don't get to use much of what they studied.   It's a job, right? I get it. I share the same kind of longing for that previous intellectual challenge and like maybe I'm changing the world. I recognized, though, that when I stepped out of academia this would be the case. But I stepped away from academia because a man cannot live on intellectual challenge alone. Not an easy decision I made to cast aside all those years of hard work and training for something that I can more easily do. But, y'know, life priorities change. I don't spend all my waking hours working. I have a family. I'm trying just like you (presumably) to strike the balance of life and a rewarding, challenging career, all while not feeling the harsh emotional stress that I did in academia. This is the best I can do for now. If I could achieve a similar balance while still working on the academic research I did, yeah, I'd take it. But that's just not how the world works.  So, if you or your friends figure out how to manage that nice balance while also doing AI and statistical learning, let me know because I want in too. :)"

In your results section, you talk about model accuracy, but I wouldn't even know what model you're referring to unless I really dig into the body and find it.

If you want to get into some technical questions though, center around some background like -    what's the biggest amount data infrastructure you have worked with to make sure they can handle your data ecosystem. You should probably ask your IT or data team what you are working with prior to.  What software do you use- to make sure it matches up with your business' software or perhaps industry standard (R/Python/SAS/SQL/etc).  A good one is to have them walk you through a recent data analysis bit they did. If you interview a few people, the real winners will stand out on that question.    I personally think the best way to interview a data scientist is to give them a data challenge or steal from Kaggle and pick the top 5 or so to do a personality assessment."

Less of an ""I wanted to play with cool toys"" vibe and more of an ""the business is doing X, and this thing I put together became a core part of how X is done"".

I know you want a magic bullet, but the only way to get an intuitive grasp on any of this is to start working with data.  Find some data, or collect it yourself (try starting with Twitter data because collecting it correctly is a bit of a challenge, but it gives you great access to some Python libraries, working with JSON if you choose, etc.).  Setting up automated collecting of Twitter data (I used a raspberry pi, Python, bash scripting....), cleaning the collected data (de-duping [hash tables oh fun!], validating the JSON, etc.), and then analyzing the actual data (temporal, spatial (location), sentiment analysis, etc.).  There is no shortage of ways to get into this, you just have to be creative, think about a problem, then solve it.

If that is not feasible, apply to a large corporation that needs people with your current skills and is at least starting to employ some higher level data scientists. Hopefully they will also have tuition assistance. Then pursue your Masters part-time over a somewhat longer time span - say 3 years. All the while seek advice and mentoring from the people already in that role.  You have lots of options and the SQL work you currently do will come in handy even after you learn the higher level skills.

datascience,371xqu,fitfifty,1 point,Sun May 24 21:18:15 2015 UTC,Masters in Statistics:  Statistics as a field has a longer more stable history and a Masters degree will open up a variety of opportunities in traditional businesses roles in addition to data science roles.   Data Science as a field is more multi-disciplinary. I love the multi-disciplinary aspect of it in practice but I fear that people who set out to do data science in an academic program will end up just getting an introduction to each discipline.  I think people are better off getting really expert at one aspect of data science and then filling in the rest at a generally competent level.  Because you already are a practitioner with significant SQL experience and are learning programming on your own - the discipline you are really missing is the statistics.  So I am inclined to say that you get your Masters in Statistics and really deeply learn R while there.  Meanwhile don't lose sight of maintaining your skills with databases and keep improving your knowledge of Python.

This couple of sets is used only for parameter tuning (in those classifers which have tunable parameters), selecting the parameter values which provide the best accuracy on the test set.   From this I take that parameter tuning was done with the whole dataset. Agree?   Then, using the selected values for the tunable parameters, a 4-fold cross validation is developed using the whole available data.   Then they train using the same dataset? wtf? Clearly the results should lean towards high-variance predictors. They also do some shady stuff in the preprocessing, making all categorical features numerical (they acknowledge this, but never say why).  They should have adopted the same procedure that other papers of this type have done."

The one I linked is older, compares less classifiers, and uses less datasets. But IMO it is more rigorous and careful. It tries to avoid using one perfomance metric in assessing the classifiers (unlike delgado's, which uses accuracy and friedman rank). It also does a cool bootstrapping technique at the end which is very intuitive for someone in data science who wants an answer to the question ""what are the top classifiers I should consider using on any arbitrary dataset?""  I would really enjoy seeing an updated version of this paper, using the exact same techniques. Haven't searched for it though."

They write    We used this methodology in order to keep low the computational cost of the experimental work   so maybe the justification is that tuning the hyperameters once per each CV fold would be too expensive. However it means there is an opportunity for overfitting.  I think we can assume the preprocessing was done so that all their classifiers work on each dataset. Some of the classifiers listed there no doubt cannot handle categorical values, although it definitely seems strange to use a quantization scheme rather than use 1-hot encoding.  There might be a few weird things going on, but IMO the results are still interesting and not completely invalidated."

Since you already have CS undergrad and SW industry experience - maybe you  could go for a Masters in Statistics and pick up grad level course or two from CS department on machine learning as part of your electives to round out that particular aspect of your learning.

I use Python for data acquisition and cleaning, and for simulation, and then I use R for analysis/predictive modeling/graphics/whatever.  I think that Python is catching up to R in the areas where R is good (just my sense).  Python is generally a better structured programming language in my opinion (much clearer objects and introspection) and so when the analysis tools are as complete and simple as they are in R, and when the graphics are as good, I think we'll see some mass migration towards Python.

Unfortunately, a more well known company almost always helps you more than a lesser known one; even if you learn more at a lesser known one. When I get hundreds of resumes for a position the ""brand"" of your prior companies is another data point I can use to filter through the noise.

datascience,36d0fu,thefrontpageofme,1 point,Mon May 18 13:55:01 2015 UTC,"I second Azure ML for clean production machine learning pipelines. For data scientists, they do a visual drag and drop approach to machine learning (including stuff like hyper parametic optimization as well as distributed learning). For deploying and ops teams, they provide a simple API that you can call for predictions. The prediction API is given availability guarantees (like 99.9%), scales as the traffic to your website increases. Plus, it takes a click of a button to convert the experiment into a production API. Takes a lot of headache from the engineering side.  Their price points are pretty good. Experimentation is free, so run all the heavy training jobs for no cost. They charge per API call, which was cheaper than had we run our own virtual machines on the cloud 24x7."

datascience,36d0fu,Levi_Data,3,Mon May 18 20:56:05 2015 UTC,"So I use R production creating predictions live per user request on a website.  I don't know exactly what kind of detail you want here, but here's generally how it works:   Our website uses C# code to call RServe upon each user request (which is effectively a service layer for R). The request calls an R function with a request ID. We take the request ID, then use an RJDBC connection to go live grab all related data and push into a data.frame. From the data.frame we run a secondary query which that tells us which models to run.  This queries a relational entity that I developed to store a massive number of contingent ML models. We run a loop (not ideal, but parallelism is limited) to load the models and create predictions. A bunch of cleanup code that bags, aggregates, and makes the ""decision"" from the prediction algorithms. Also pushes the data back to SQL, and simultaneously presents it to RServe so it can be used directly by the application.   I blog on using R/ML algorithms directly in production, here's a recent more thought out post on how we're using ML in production and challenges:  http://www.datasciencenotes.com/2015/02/r-in-production-diaries-rjava-made-me.html"

datascience,36d0fu,Levi_Data,1 point,Mon May 18 16:54:35 2015 UTC,"It runs in about a tenth of a second, from request to response.  At first it was quite slow (2-3 seconds), but we optimized each part of process.  The biggest performance gains came in pre-loading required R packages, and stripping down model files to bare minimums (R tends to save down way to much info in model files).  I've blogged on both with details on how those optimizations work.   Ironically, I work in an industry where the expectation of speed is quite low.  Executives told me they'd be fine if I just kept everything under 15 seconds!!!"

datascience,36d0fu,Levi_Data,1 point,Mon May 18 19:11:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That is some insight into how things work.  So, every time a request is made, in the backend you gather the related data from the live table and perform logic and reply. You do all the processing for each request? Do you use some kind of caching if the same request is being made again?  For example if a webpage displays some predictions and a user refreshes the page, would the request be sent again?  Also, could you shed some insight on the user_meta query that I asked?"
datascience,36d0fu,lilPnut,1 point,Mon May 18 15:27:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, we effectively do all processing for each request.  It's fairly lightweight so not a huge cost, but each request runs as a separate transaction.  We could do this asynchronously and process multiple simultaneously (every 5 seconds?) but currently doesn't make sense to hold up any transactions. There is an effective caching, which is held in a C# rules engine.  Basically, use the same response, so long as it's been less than x amount of time, and data is essentially the same.  If data changes on the webpage significantly, we will re-run the request. On the user_meta question.. I'm not an expert in MVC, but I think I get an idea for what you're talking about.  Essentially, you want to create additional data models that contain semi-aggregate data for ML prediction.  A couple of thoughts on this: first, for my example above, because everything is realtime and I have fast-running SQL to pull data, there's no need (or ability for pre-aggregation).  Second, in a prior application, I used something similar to what you're suggesting, but it was effectively offline (in an analytics sandbox) that ran through an ETL process and created a side data-warehouse, and then pushed back to production.  Since requests were not needed real-time (last night's values were valid all-day today) this was ok in this instance."

Ideally your tools belt should have: 1. R 2. Python (including exp with its machine learning packages) 3. SQL (advanced queries to work with multiple messy data sources) 4. Machine learning and statistical (sounds like you have the latter) predictive analytics methodologies 5. Experience with the Hadoop ecosystem (Hadoop, Hive, Pig, Spark)    If you do have all of those skills, look for a project (Kaggle is a good avenue) where you can tackle a business problem where you start with giant messy (ideally unstructured) data and combine your skills/tools to answer a business-relevant predictive analytics problem from start to end. Wrangling difficult/large data -> delivering business insight.    In most cases, I think that if you have all the right skills (and especially if you have any internship exp with the kind of projects I described), you should look for a job.

Whether he has an advanced degree in Stats/Math or CS (or other related quantitative fields), he'll have a much better shot at a career in DS than if he decides to learn independently and only has an undergrad degree. Saying that stats or CS is the way to go ignores way too many factors; he needs to find a program that will teach the correct tools and give him a chance to apply them to the right problems (ideally through industry partnerships), and there's definitely a range of degrees that can accomplish that.

I work with a few recent stats graduates (Columbia, NYU, Yeshiva) and I would like for those schools to refund their tuition.  You have taught yourself what comprises of 80% of data scientist jobs and that is to wrangle data (not taught to stats majors).  The stats part is relatively easy as there are many software to do the stats part.  I think you've set yourself up to be a very good data miner/data engineer to support data scientist and that would be your way in.  This will allow you to have great salary and perks and learn on the job...win/win.  I have a BA in economics, self taught SQL(fibbed a little to get my first analyst job), self taught python, and I'm doing advanced analytics and work with data scientists (not a big fan of stats but love the applications thereof).  My humble opinions below:  1.) I wish smart people like you would be dumber.  Meaning, I see so many successful people (even data scientists) where the strongest skills is the willingness to over reach their skillsets and experience and 'fake it till they make it'.  Most times it works, sometimes it doesn't but some opportunities will not come back around.  Stop outsmarting yourself and start believing in yourself.  2.) STEM jobs are the closet thing to a meritocracy that we have, unless you really like the subject matter, would like to teach, or go into research, advanced STEM degrees are not needed at all.  3.) Market yourself.  Post on every job board, go to networking events.  A lot of companies are looking for your data skill set and you could negotiate for a transition to data science.  4.) Try, fail, improve, repeat.  This not only should apply to your technical skills but your people skills.  I try to take as many interviews as I can.  I can tell you I've bombed a lot of interviews but you start to learn what people want to hear.  There is no class that can teach that.  I hope that helps. Good luck!"

If Matlab is your primary tool, it will hurt your job search immensely (unless you're looking in a few pretty specific areas... usually academia). In general, if you want to be relevant for the most Data Science positions, I'd say R is the #1 statistics program by far, and you'll need Python as well. Sometimes java or other scription languages can make up for a lack of Python, but Python is ideal. You absolutely need some kind of general coding language, so if you're starting from scratch, learn Python. After that, SQL is usually a must, and Hadoop experience will be a major advantage."

Maybe do some kaggle competitions to beef up that side of things, or if you can get an internship involving customer data, ad targeting, marketing, or other non-OR projects you should be in good shape. Make sure you learn R, Python, SQL, how to apply machine learning algorithms, and ideally get hands-on experience with Hadoop one way or another.

I found some of the techniques also helped me think of creative solutions other data scientists might not have--esp. simulation analysis, which can be usefully applied to many data science problems--and the econ spin has guided my work interests.  I'd just recommend you start thinking of where the gaps are and fill them in early, either in or out of the classroom. I'd expect this would include basic machine learning (e.g. random forests), R if they don't have you using it (my program only included one semester of Matlab), and web visualization (e.g. d3.js)."

datascience,367tx5,BScHolder,2,Sun May 17 00:25:41 2015 UTC,"This tool looks interesting. But, I'm a little concerned about how it works. First, I want to be clear that I participate in doctorial research in the area Information Quality.   Machine learning has been studied in the context of Information Quality, or more specifically data quality (quality inherent to the data--not from application). But, I don't want to argue about the semantics of the words. I've read a handful of papers regarding the topic of applying machine learning to identify data quality issues. It looks very promising.   Looking at the github page, there is a brief description of how it functions. My concerns come from that description. You need to have data that is already in good condition. More specifically,the conditional functional dependencies of the data need to be evaluated and confirmed as correct. This means that you are going to have to perform a rigorous assessment to ensure  that all of the defined conditional functional dependencies have been validated.  This could be accomplished in a couple of ways:   Sample manual validation Logical rule set check   This could involve creating sample data set. Though, it seems that this sample would need to be of a reasonable size if you have a complex set of conditional functional dependencies. Still, you risk in accuracies in the human validation (we have our own error rate).   The alternative, creating and applying a logical rule set, is much like data quality analysis is done today at organizations that implement them (a lot but not enough of them). You would create rules that the data should satisfy and check all of the records to see if they satisfy them. If not, you have to handle the unsatisfactory reasons according to the business processes they impact.   If you go as far as creating all of these business rules, you can just apply them. I don't see the value in using machine learning for D.Q. in this particular way. Regardless, it looks like an interesting tool and I will investigate further."
datascience,367tx5,dman87,1 point,Sun May 17 15:58:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comment. When I designed this project I tried to not focus much on discovering CFDs. There's a lot to check for a set of CFDs ; consistency which is NP-Complete, implication (coNP) and the idea of algorithmically discovering constraints is a another research area (if anyone is interested, I suggest reading ""Discovering Conditional Functional Dependencies"" by Wenfei Fan).   Instead, as you said, experts can also create these CFDs based on business logic. This approach can be expensive, but is still done today. The tool focuses more on what happens after you acquire a set of valid and consistent set of CFDs by the user, and how to repair violating tuples so that we are closer to a more consistent dataset in regards to our CFDs. The repairing part (determining what attribute to change and what's the new value) is done with machine learning.   There's room for improvement ofcourse. Incorporating user feedback, for example, can help with more accurate predictions for further rounds of the system, and so on."
datascience,367tx5,dman87,1 point,Sun May 17 22:47:42 2015 UTC,"It looks very interesting!   For most (all?) machine learning approaches to data quality, you have to have that baseline. It can be from manually validated sets and others methods. It's the main crux of this type of approach for data quality. But, the older, more traditional methods are not without their own issues in this regard either. They can take an extensive amount of preparation work. I don't think that your work is really penalized for that component. It is just the part of this type of work that I, and most practitioners, would like to minimize.  It looks like great stuff!

How is what you are doing as a data specialist not what you think being a data scientist would be? If you answer this I can give you a more non-generic answer.  Generic Answer:  I agree with tony about Cormen's book - being able to read algorithms is pretty important, try get to the level where you can implement this: http://www.cleveralgorithms.com/nature-inspired/swarm/pso.html (the Pseudocode for PSO bit) to solve a non straightforward optimization problem in Rn (hopefully you know what Rn is otherwise you will need to do some calculus and linear algebra). You don't need to know anything about particle swarm optimisation but you should be able to read an algorithm, understand what it does (i.e. what are its pluses and minuses) and write code to perform that algorithm.  After this you can do what I think the standard MOOCs are - CS109 from Harvard and ML from Ng and then apply for jobs."

Here is a good pet project to do, in my opinion anyway. You might think its shit or can think of something more related to your field:  We spend $Xm on TV advertising with a Call to Action (CTA) to visit our website. Various studies have shown that those who view ads with CTAs like this are most likely to visit the website within 5 minutes of watching the ad - but we aren't sure of this.  From our media buyer (the person who buys slots on TV) we get an Excel file with the following columns:   slot (the time our 30 second ad started) channel (the channel the ad was shown on) the cost of this slot($) the TARPS for this slot (this is an estimation of the number of people in our target market who are watching the advertisement)   From Google analytics, assume we can get the number of website hits hourly.

datascience,35xd29,bendy_straw_ftw,4,Thu May 14 08:34:15 2015 UTC,"Just a quick comment based on my experience.  These companies (Data Incubator, Insight) are not looking to teach you much.  They want people that already have the skill-set to create a project.   7 weeks is barely enough time to produce a minimum viable product that is actually impressive - including visualization etc.  Remember - they make money from marketing you after the program, and they can't make you into a machine learning expert in that amount of time.   I imagine that Ph.D's that did a large amount of machine learning in python in school are the primary targets for them.  I would recommend an educational program like Metis if you need to polish up your skill-set.  I went there this winter and it was a very positive experience for me.  About me:  Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience in December.  About to start a data science job in industry."
datascience,35xd29,agentsmyth,2,Thu May 14 23:21:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah I figured. I think I exaggerated about how disappointed I was in the OP. Sorry about that. I know I'm not experienced enough. I'm looking to rectify that though, and I'm taking a lot more MOOCs now and delving deeper into data visualisation. I would love to do the Metis program but unfortunately, I am not in a situation to pay that much. Thanks for the tips though! And congrats on getting a job in the Data Science field! :)"
datascience,35xd29,InvolvingSalmon,3,Thu May 14 23:38:09 2015 UTC,"I got rejected last winter, and plan on re-applying after I get some more CS classes under my belt. The data incubator sounds like a great program, but to all those who end up rejected: remember that a program like this is not necessary to get a job in data science. Especially to those of us still in academia, it might feel like this sort of program is the only safe way to make the switch. By virtue of getting through to the challenge questions of the application, you can rest assured that your CV/resume is impressive enough to land you some solid job interviews as well. Data science is a big market right now, and a negligible fraction of employed data scientists came out of programs like the data incubator.   I'm not trying to rail against it, because it's definitely a great opportunity, I'm just suggesting that people take OP's strategy of thinking about where they may have fallen short in the application, and improving those skills. Find the silver-lining rather than being crestfallen."

I've seen people who had a combination of self taught and some practical hands on experience put the ones with degrees to shame.......  College/Universities are meant to train you to think and solve problems.  I'd go for specialized certifications or certificate courses RELEVANT to where you want to go in the corporate world.  DBA demands some good money right now.  Search youtube for ""Shift Happens"".  One of the quotes is ""We are currently preparing students for jobs that don’t yet exist and teaching them to use technologies that haven’t been invented, in order to solve problems we don’t even know are problems yet.""  You have your degree, which satisfies the Human Resources resume gatekeepers."

And yes, like software engineering, one can reasonably teach themselves everything that's needed and gain experience through side projects/contests.  And yes, as of right IMO now it's basically purely to get past HR. Unlike SE, data science has not yet gained the same reputation/context amongst HR as being something one can pick up. And even for SE this is still mostly applicable in tech companies.  My 2 cents that build off of jeffrey_f's post: unless you're confident you can get into Google/LinkedIn/Twitter/Facebook with self-taught skills in statistics, data mining, machine learning, and others, then you should get a MS to get in the door. Outside of those companies (and those like them) HR will most likely want to see a degree."

Use Linked-In or other networking to find those people (even use your old college career center) and get an ""informal interview"".  They will be able to tell you what they value and look for in candidates and that will help you figure out if it's worth getting one of these degrees or another.

datascience,35w70s,PoachYellowElephants,1 point,Thu May 14 01:40:18 2015 UTC,"I think if you're looking to become a Data Scientist, it would very much be worth getting a Masters, especially because your undergrad degree isn't super technical (like Applied States, Comp Sci, etc.). I don't think BI or Data Analysis are the best bets though. Northwestern has a great MSiA (Master of Science in Analytics) program, not to be confused with their online Predictive Analytics program which is dicey.    I only recruit for Data Scientist positions, so this advice only applies if that's your end goal, but if you're going back to school, I would focus on a program where you can:    *Learn how to perform predictive analytics using advanced statistics and/or machine learning algorithms (most marketable tools: R and Python) *Learn how to clean, transform, and mine data, including unstructured and/or streaming data, and get it into a form that you can analyze with the methods above (preferred tools: Python, advanced SQL, Hadoop/Hive/Pig, AWS) *Work on projects where you start with said unruly data and pull out actionable business insights, doing the whole thing soup-to-nuts on your own *Get connected with internships and make good industry connections. This will make an incredible difference in your ability to snag a job. If the project experience that I mentioned in the last point comes from an internship, you're golden    Regardless of if this stuff can be learned on your own, hiring managers and HR departments will view you very differently without an advanced degree. If you do managed to get hired in a legitimate DS role, your pay grade will most likely be substantially lower without an advanced degree. I've even worked with candidates who have been working for 5+ years in relevant positions but get passed up on because they only have a Bachelors."
datascience,35w70s,DJ_InsideVoice,1 point,Fri May 15 18:37:00 2015 UTC,No... When data science is no longer a fad do you  want to be qualified to be a statistician or computer scientist?  A data science degree makes you underqualified for both.
datascience,35w70s,skywalkrncsu,0,Thu May 14 16:27:23 2015 UTC,I wouldn't waste my time or money getting any degree in BI.  Maybe the curriculum is different than what I am imagining but I would much rather get a masters in analytics or an MBA with a focus in analytics as they would be much more marketable.  That is what I did and it MORE than paid for itself in just one year.

As a hiring manager it's a huge plus when people post projects online and I generally ask them to walk me through their favorite one. The problem you'll have is getting your information to people like me. A lot then depends on your background and prior work experience. I'm not really a fan of the 12-week bootcamps unless you are coming in with a strong quantitative background (and in that case is it really necessary?).

As many others in this thread have mentioned - projects are really what they are looking for. They want proof you have skills, know what you are talking about, and will be influential.  The greatest challenge in not having a degree, is getting noticed by the recruiters/hiring managers. Thankfully, as part of your Nanodegree program you have direct access to our Careers VP and we've had considerable success in placing graduates in positions. For all intents and purposes, in job descriptions - the degree prerequisite is just there to ""thin out the crowd"". Most recruiters/hiring managers receive tons of applicants that are nowhere near qualified for the position, so this is just one way in which they try to preemptively thin out that crowd.  Unofficial, my own opinion: It's not Data Science, but I've been a Web Developer for over 16 years - I have no college degree (I went to FSU for 3 days). I've hired dozens of developers - your credentials, GPA, school name, etc. mean absolutely nothing to me. When I see your resume, I'm going to Google you and look at your blog, GitHub, LinkedIn, personal projects. If you have projects out there that interest me and are indicative of your skillset, I'm interested.  The most disappointing interview I ever did in my life was with a NASA scientist.

datascience,35prg7,n3cr0ph4g1st,2,Wed May 13 04:13:14 2015 UTC,"Hey guy,  Happy to give the run down!  Background: I've been working in marketing data for ~8 years (paid search, web/media/social/CRM analytics). It's been awesome! I actually almost never modeled anything in my career, as basic marketing analytics doesn't require marketing to make quick decisions or create reports for less number saavy marketers.  I have an undergrad in Math & Economics, but didn't go heavy stats or anything.  I wrote an article about why I choose Zipfian. Perhaps that can guide you weather those reasons are relevant to you. http://indigoinsights.co/2015/03/30/im-enrolling-to-zipfian-academy/ (Note: site in beta; article is recently written & back-dated, but content is accurate; I'm still tweaking the article).  For you: In terms of is it ""needed""?  I don't think for a recent college grad with CS & ENG is needed. The biggest reason I did this was I couldn't keep trying to teach myself outside of work and work on projects as ""proof"" of experience.  Could I model before this? YES!  Was I great? ehhh, I was ""OK"". Not bad, but not great by any means. Has Zipfian helped? YES! Learning the finer skills.  I wold love to continue the management track I was on down the line, however as a manager, I prefer having hands on experience in my field to share (rather than just manage others without having done myself).  It sounds like your best option is to find a job that you can go to, get paid & learn hands-on at. Consider larger companies for a first gig, rather than smaller, but sexy start-ups. While you work, seek to understand what role you want (data eng? math-y data science? marketing data science? data products? etc).  IMHO FWIW, data engineers will have higher salary potential & their skill sets should be in demand for years.   In terms of learning more DS concepts, I would say you're already on the right track subscribing to /r/datascience (and hopefully /r/machinelearning). Keep reading and playing with data science projects on your own. Find a dataset you like and explore it. Try to model a variable based on others. Try Kaggle competitions. If you find AFTER that you still feel you need to learn in a learning environment, only then consider Zipfian.  Happy to answer any additional questions about work experience or Zipfian. Best of luck with your masters!  Edit: Formatting; Grammar; Edited parts that were meant for private messages"

One question I did have is what salary level you were looking at that Zipfian enabled you to achieve? Also I have been looking at the data incubator fellowship program as it is made for people in academia looking to transition to private, I've heard good things, but do you have any insight as to how it would compare to the Zipfian bootcamp?

I will say that their business model is hinging on the employer paying the fees, which means starting salary is likely to be a bit lower (since part of the position's budget is being spent on employee search).  Salary touted on Zipfian's website for graduates is $115k (http://www.zipfianacademy.com/)  For comparison, look at Glassdoor: $119k nationally & $127k in SF (http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/data-scientist-salary-SRCH_KO0,14.htm) or AngelList. Zipfian's in line.  Caveat: Most of Zipfian attendees have experience, either in academia or work. Experience contributes to starting salaries."

I wouldn't say I know how to code in R, I know how to get it to do what I want.  I just saw something on Khan Academy about a free SQL class, I would definitely recommend checking something like that out and then just learn by doing.   I cannot reiterate enough how having problems to solve is the key to learning.  You can take a SQL class and still not really be a good SQL coder.

You will need a comprehensive set of skills that span both: business intelligence (data warehousing, OLAP, reporting, SQL, ETL, descriptive analytics) as well as data science skills (prescriptive analytics, machine learning, data lake, big data, NoSQL, statistics etc.) just to hold down an intro level data science job.  You may get a ""data science"" position that is masked as a glorified report writer or analyst.

She said he worked in IT and he was making about 42k with a Masters Degree in Computer Science.  The host simply said ""Is he any good?"" and the conversation went on how he needed to get certifications and some other nonsense.  In my opinion, the woman's husband was the canonical example of someone who should not be in IT.  Don't be that guy with 120k in debt and work a 45k report writer position...without seriously testing the waters and spending 2-3 years in the field.

datascience,35g7pt,maxToTheJ,12,Sun May 10 01:42:13 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing: a data scientist is not a glorified data analyst. The problem is that a lot of companies don't understand what the position really entails, so they hire people into data analyst roles and call them data scientists.   I'm a statistician. Literally. I have a masters degree in math and statistics. I currently work as a data scientist at a company that understands what that phrase means and I find my work to be generally compelling and engaging.   Before I had this job I worked as a data analyst/developer. My job was very different then from what I do now. When I started looking for work as a data scientist after grad school, because of my work experience a few places would try to recruit me to work as a data analyst. All of those jobs were very similar to the work I used to do. I know what a ""data analyst"" is and I know the difference between a data analyst and a data scientist.  Trust me: a data scientist is not the same thing as a data analyst. It is not a ""glorified data analyst.""   The danger is that there are an increasing number of job training programs that are training people to be ""data scientists"" that are really just giving them data analyst skills (I'm generally very suspicious of bootcamps), and consequently this confusion is aggravated by companies that are satisfied to hire ""data scientists"" to do data analyst work.  This does not mean that ""data scientists"" are overhyped or that the position will die. It does mean that the appropriate meaning/use of that job title may be (or rather ""probably is"") getting diluted. In a few years instead of calling myself a data scientist it may make more sense to market myself as a statistician or a mathematician, but the need for the job that I do isn't going anywhere. There was plenty of need for it before the position was called ""data scientist"" and there will still be plenty of need for it if that phrase loses its meaning.  The data science job market is strong and isn't going anywhere."

datascience,35g7pt,EatingCake,16,Sun May 10 13:18:56 2015 UTC,"A data analyst is basically a SQL monkey. They perform analyses by directly querying the data, and any numbers they return are generally just counts and averages. They may do some simple projections, but otherwise a data analyst doesn't really use statistics at all.   Data scientists build models that answer questions and generate predictions/classifications. A lot of energy goes into defining appropriate questions/hypotheses, feature engineering, evaluating the significance and accuracy of results, comparing and combining different models, etc. A lot of statistics and/or machine learning is involved.   The output of the work of both a data analyst and a data scientist will likely have a visualization/dashboard component to it. But a data scientist will deliver a model, whereas a data analyst will just deliver some queries and tabular reports.   The skillset of a data analyst is a subset of the skills of a data scientist. A data scientist could do the job of a data analyst, but would not find the work very fulfilling. The reverse is not true: a data analyst does not have the requisite skillset to do the work of a data scientist (and if they do, they shouldn't be working as an analyst)."

A few examples: if your team creates software, you need one good model. And then huge amount of time is spent on making it production ready with automatic data pipelines, logging, and scaling the model to M or B examples.   If your  team is different and needs multiple results of one-time predictive analysis, you need the predictions to be interprerable and therefore don't use models much more complex than average or generalized linear .  Can you share what is it you do at work and how your models are useful? Pm if needed.."

datascience,35g7pt,patrickSwayzeNU,1 point,Sun May 10 21:00:41 2015 UTC,I like your definitions. Can you please elaborate on the differences of working as a statiscian or as a data scientist?
datascience,35g7pt,iatowks,1 point,Mon May 11 14:23:34 2015 UTC,"Mostly I'd say it depends on who I'm talking to. Sometimes I describe myself as a statistician, sometimes I describe myself as a data scientist. Just as there is variability in what people mean by ""data scientist"", there can be a lot of variability in what people mean by ""statistician"". I've met people who held the job title of ""statistician"" at the US census who were not by a long shot what I would call a statistician: that job title at the census is a mathematical statistician (i.e. basically everyone at the census is a statistician, but only a few people are ""math stats""). I think as a rule though a statistician won't necessarily be expected to be as proficient at software engineering as a data scientist would.  Also -- and probably more importantly -- the kinds of problems a ""statistician"" works on are often different from what a ""data scientist"" works on. Statisticians are generally concerned with inference, which means they need interpretable models. Data scientists are generally more concerned with generating accurate predictions. They're often not necessarily interested in causality at all, just results. This can be dangerous in a business context (depending how a client uses the results), but it also means data scientists are often freer to build complex, completely uninterpretable models as long as the output performs well."
datascience,35g7pt,shaggorama,5,Sun May 10 18:08:32 2015 UTC,data science involves more computational type of work (predictive and numerical modeling) and using more scientific methods whereas data analyst roles are more or less data cleaning and reporting.
datascience,35g7pt,watersign,3,Sun May 10 21:08:39 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends on what the particular individual who works as a data scientist does.  To quote one of the articles you posted:   Don’t be the data scientist tasked with the crime-scene cleanup of most companies’ “Big Data”—be the developer, programmer, or entrepreneur who can think, code, and create the future.   I can confidently say there are many data scientists who can think,code, and create the future. As far as what you should do, do what interests you. CS or DS, if you enjoy it and are good at it you'll be able to command a pretty nice salary."
datascience,35g7pt,jmportilla,3,Sun May 10 14:47:22 2015 UTC,"They say that they are basically glorified statisticians who know how to code a little and ask the right questions.   Anything that is hyped also has naysayers, it's just the way it is. With that said, what's overhyped about a ""glorified"" statistician that knows programming, data engineering, how to ask the right questions, and how to deliver results and communicate insights? There's nothing overhyped about that.  Some in here that are hilariously suggesting 70k salaries for data science are just suffering very heavily from a pessimism bias that is more psychological than grounded in reality.  The hype isn't causing the demand, the hype is a consequence of the demand. Maybe it is overhyped, but the demand is strong and exists for good reason- the skill set combination of a data scientist is extremely valuable so that will lead to higher salaries. That isn't going away any time soon."
datascience,35g7pt,dinRdo,2,Sun May 10 06:17:07 2015 UTC,I think definitely right now CS is more valuable but I think in the future data scientists will become more valuable as companies realize the value of data. Also I think there will be a ton of supply of CS grads in the near future as everybody is going into that field. So probably just do what you like and are good at. Sorry that's the best advice I can offer you.
datascience,35g7pt,pybokeh,2,Sun May 10 17:14:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt worry too much about growth of DS career.  If I were to become a data scientist, I'd definitely go into consulting or a company that has a variety of different data domains.  Otherwise, I would imagine it would get old.  I'm a data analyst and the type of data I work with is pretty much the same and from the same sources.  Currently, I wish I could work with a variety of data.  Things only get interesting for me when we extract from new data sources or when we develop a new data warehouse.  But this only occurs every 5 or so years.    If you like to tinker with data and like the field of statistics, go for DS career.  As others have pointed out, do what you love doing."
datascience,35g7pt,awgl,3,Sun May 10 01:44:03 2015 UTC,"How about this question: Will Hack Reactor/App Academy or Zipfian Academy be around in 10-20 years? If you attend a trendy school that no longer exists, how will that look on your resume in the future? Will it even carry any weight? No on knows the answer to this since these hack schools are only a recent phenomenon. Also, these schools do not give you a real degree. I am skeptical of the long term benefit of these schools. On the flip side, will an established institution like Oregon State (or whatever university you had in mind for a CS masters or some other grad school program) be around in 10-20 years? I think so. Moreover, the masters degree will almost certainly involve a research project and/or thesis that will take a lot of work to complete, which, IMHO, is a far more meaningful demonstration of your skills and creativity than cranking through some tutorials in 10 weeks.  Since the question you are asking is about education, the point I'm trying to make is about associating yourself with a well known institution and meaningful work. While many of us in tech seem to believe that education doesn't matter as long as you have the skills to do the job, I find, in my own experience, that is only a half truth. Skills are absolutely important, yes. You won't get hired without skills. But if you are presented with two resumes listing the same skills and one has a masters degree from Big State University versus certificate from Super Cool Hacker School, which do you think is more attractive? Who will really have those purported skills?   On top of all this, I've seen a lot of postings for DS positions that state they require a masters or PhD. Those are the DS jobs that make 6 figure salaries, not the analyst with a hack school certificate. So if highest salary is your main motivator, the graduate degree will most likely pay off in the long run (IMHO). And it will open new doors."

I did learn a lot.  I had no statistics courses in undergrad, just up through Calc-3, so it was nice getting a stats class and a few predictive modeling courses under my belt.  I wish they offered a few Machine Learning for Computer Science type people courses.    However, I really don't know if the cost is worth it.  50K for what amounted to about 80% book learning, and 20% teacher learning.

NW's program had been up and running for a couple years at the time.  Looking at it now, I probably should have gone Berkley since it looks like their program has a bit more machine learning, which is my forte.  I really wanted to go through Northwestern's full time, in-person, program, but there was no way I could swing quitting work for a couple years.  That's when I started looking into their online program a bit more.  The NW program has changed quite a bit since I started too.  I think having a few graduating classes get through really helped them evaluate gaps in the program and what people enjoy/hate.  They used to require everybody take both a Leadership and a Project Management course.  Now you take one or the other, and they've changed the PM course into a Data Science specific PM course, solidifying the whole CRISP-DM method.  They also split up the two class predictive modeling sequence (Class 1 - Linear/Logistic regression; Class 2 - Econometrics/Time Series), into a three course sequence (Class 1 - Linear; Class 2 - Logistic; Class 3 - Econometrics).  They're focused on adding many more electives too.  They have Sports Analytics electives now (wish they had them when I was in).  They've said they plan on other domain-specific courses.  Additionally, they recognized that a lot of people didn't have a super strong math background when entering, and added a ""Math for Modelers"" course at the front end of the program.  Catching people up on some linear algebra and such (something I really could have used when I went through).  So what was an 11 course sequence is now a 13 course sequence.  At ~4K per course it went from 44k to 52k.  Plus a couple hundred bucks in books for each course.  I guess we'll see how much clout the Northwestern name comes with in the job hunt.  If the Data Scientist shortage numbers, and salary estimates are correct, I should see a sizable jump.  Here's hoping.  I do think we'l see a little bubble in the Data Scientist job market.  Big companies like Microsoft are already offering predictive analytics software meant for people without the fancy degrees.  I'm sure a lot of companies will decide that is good enough.  Northwestern also offers an advanced graduate certificate for former grads.  It's basically a program where you come back and take four more electives.  I might go back in a couple years for that, if I feel it'll help me stay current.  TLDR: Went with the established program at the time (early '13).  They've changed it a lot over the years.  I may go back for more.  I hope I can get a good job soon-ish."

datascience,35bxh9,MyDayJobSucks,3,Mon May 11 23:05:31 2015 UTC,"Overall, a 4/10 in difficulty from a ""How the hell do I do this?"" standpoint.  Really, the two modeling courses are what gave me the hardest time, from an understanding new concepts angle.  From a course load standpoint, I'd give it a 8/10 in difficulty.  Northwestern has 10 week quarters instead of your traditional 16 week semester.  Which means the courses are pretty condensed.  I also elected to take two at a time because I wanted to finish as fast as possible.  I was basically reading text books or working on course work 4 out of 5 weeknights, and most of my weekends.   I found it all very interesting (except for the project management course).  I'm was (still am) in a bit of a rut at my current job.  I don't really feel like I use my brain all that much.  It was exciting to turn my brain back on and learn new stuff, especially the machine learning given my CS background.

Gotta say, I wish I had take one in undergrad, along with a linear algebra course."
datascience,35bxh9,Wafzig,2,Fri May 8 22:35:49 2015 UTC,hypothesis testing is just easier to learn while doing which is why it is something people instill when they do research like in a grad program since research is a big component of a grad program.

datascience,35bxh9,MITranger,3,Sat May 9 01:25:44 2015 UTC,"I wish I could say that surprises me.  There were definitely a few people I encountered who were going through the program just because ""Big Data"" is the ""IT"" thing right now.  They had little math or computer background, and really didn't get what was going on.  I'm sure a few of them slipped all the way through the program.  I think the one area where the accelerated nature of the Northwestern program really hurts students, is that NW can't take enough time to really make sure that people know how to ""program"" in the stats packages.  I had to do the majority of code writing for my group projects.    Most students could interpret the results of some standard models on perfect data sets.  When it came time to do a project from the ground up with dirty data, they were mostly lost."

Now, they've made this better by adding a ""Math for Modelers"" course to the beginning of the curriculum, even before taking the ""Intro to Stats"" course.  I am a little jealous of the folks who get to go through their new curriculum.  They've addressed the gaps in the old curriculum pretty well by adding the extra math course up front, and splitting modeling 1&2 into a 3 course sequence.   They also make sure now that everybody who gets all the way through is exposed to: SAS, R, and Python.   When I went through you had a tiny amount of SPSS, two courses with SAS, one with WEKA, and then you had to make sure you took electives that used R to get any R exposure.  One piece of advice that I would give to prospective students is research the professors.  There seemed to be quite a bit of variance in student reviews.  Some profs were consistently in the 5+/6 stars.  Some were consistently in that 3/6 star range.  EDIT: I just realized you asked what I thought other people should have had as far as skills go.  I think some decent data experience would be good.  I think what helped me out a lot is that I've been working with data and databases for years prior to going in.  I'd advise even looking at some of the free online datasets that exist.  Just to get a feel for how people set up their data for analysis.  Some basic understanding of computers at a low level would help.  I had to carry one of my teams a bit because they didn't understand that our large dataset was running into memory issues on their laptop when trying to use some of the more greedy Machine Learning algorithms.  And then a little bit of math.  The people with STEM backgrounds did okay on math.  Econ backgrounds did okay on math."

The GT course seems really heavy on engineering which is, of course, a necessary data science skill set.  However, I find the programs that focus more on developing the business skill set in parallel to create more successful long-term data scientist careers (normal caveat around anecdotes, opinions, etc as this is only based on my own experience).  Being able to speak and move through the language and concerns of business leaders makes you seem like a wizard who can solve all their problems with math rather than the engineer who works on the recommendation algorithm for one of their products.  It's the difference between building products and software and deciding which products, software, and features to build, how to price it, how to market it, etc.  I generally don't work on production systems or models; instead most of the models I build are used for decision making and for documents and presentations with executives.   I don't think the GT course would have prepared me for that but that is also not the focus of their masters.  Of course, if you don't want present to executives and you just want to be a hardcore engineer then the GT masters seems pretty fantastic for the money."

I think the Georgia Tech one briefly touches on the topic.
datascience,35bxh9,fhadley,1 point,Tue May 12 04:53:03 2015 UTC,"At face value, I do find it upsetting that GA Tech (Top 10 in CS) can deliver an online Master's degree in CS for an eighth of the cost of Top 10 online Data Science MS programs.  I don't know enough about the operating costs of education, nor the differences in costs of teaching CS vs DS, but I imagine that delivering content on an online medium has to decrease costs somehow.  In that regard, I really do think that programs like Berkeley MIDS, at $60k, are over-priced.  On a side note, do check out Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree which is actually taught in part by Zipfian.  It's $200/month (PM me for a $30 discount), and I thought it was absolutely worth the value."

Looks like the next enrollment starts on May 28.  Did you take this curriculum? What was your background and what are you doing now?

I would advise that you ""test-drive"" a course (or the whole Nanodegree) first, to see if it's a right fit for you.  You can always watch the lectures for free or do self-study, if you so desire.  Paying for the Nanodegree gets you a whole lot of other stuff, including career services.  I was a mechanical engineer and have now moved into software after taking the Nanodegrees (took the FSND and FEND, also).  IMHO, the Data Analyst one was the best out of the bunch."

Sadly, the idea of ""data scientist"" is fairly new and a lot of places that hire such people are new at figuring these things out too.  This means they tend to fall back on simple heuristics like ""Ivy League Schoool?""  That sucks for people like me working full time among data scientists plugging away part-time at my PhD at a local state university.  I would suggest looking to where you want to work after you get whatever degree you get and find out what they look for.  My company likes Stanford and MIT, but maybe the company/industry you want to work in tends to work from other universities (e.g Kellogg, etc.).

If reading the material on your own is a pain how the fuck do you think you're gonna do it professionally? I reject ppl with PhDs all the time because they tout pedigree but can't walk the walk. Screw the fancy brand naming and develop some skills. Oh and programming ability trumps math chops. You better know python and hopefully a statically typed language.

datascience,35bxh9,recipe_bitch,3,Sat May 9 21:22:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's a valid approach, but IMO there's a big difference between being able to code up some stuff and throw it on github and a formal graduate school education.  Ultimately it comes down to the individual and their abilities. Knowing how to implement gradient descent in a neural net doesn't mean you can explain the conceptual ideas behind it or what it's actually doing. Similarly, describing PCA and the linear algebra behind it doesn't mean you can implement it in Python.  From my perspective, I just feel like the knowledge part is the more difficult side of the equation. Coding isn't very difficult, but getting someone to understand what a kernel/image is (imo) a bit more difficult. I would hope someone with a MS or PhD would at least have a handle on the concept of why/how things work, and teaching them to code, etc.. would be much easier than doing it in reverse.  Definitely understand your point though, and for some people that's probably a very good route to take."

datascience,35at2o,arvi1000,10,Fri May 8 19:51:29 2015 UTC,"Everything in R you can do in Python, but not vice versa.  Python is a general purpose, high level programming language.  You can make any type of program you can think of in Python.  R is a statistical language, and made for anything related to stats.  It hosts a large community for statistics and A LOT of packages to help you with data sets.  Python's statistical libraries are still relatively new compared to R, but that doesn't mean you cannot do analytics with Python.  It just means that the conventions that have come in the R packages are slower to come to Python.  For example, Rs ggplot2 library is one of the best libraries for visualizations out there.  Python recently implemented a ggplot library but still has some bugs to get past.  I do not see why you couldn't learn both simultaneously.  I am currently learning both and what I have learned is that both in conjunction supplement each other's weaknesses.  The syntax is not all that different.  The major thing you have to remember is the R is optimized for vectorized functions.  You can use 'for' loops in R, but most of the of the time you do not have to.  A function applied to a vector will automatically apply to all the iterations.  I prefer Python for 'munging' applications and when that is finished I turn to R for the statistical analytics.  Finally when I want to develop and deploy an app, I turn back to Python.  I recommend finding a project that requires you to utilize the strengths of both and see how easily they work well together.  Hope that helps."

datascience,35b12y,mgmuscari,1 point,Fri May 8 17:37:12 2015 UTC,"So I came into my undergrad essentially as a Philosophy/Chemistry double major with the goal of going to Med School. Over 4 years I've dropped Pre-Med, dropped Chemistry, picked up and dropped Computer Science, and finally settled on a Cognitive Science major with a minor in Phil.   I'm still in undergrad, and when all is said and done I put myself on a 5-year track, but I'm getting a really strong background in machine learning through Cog Sci and I get to learn and do research in a ton of really fascinating neuroscience environments as well. If I'd stayed with just Philosophy, or tried Comp Sci for longer than I did, I'd have graduated in three years or washed out (respectively) and in either case wound up with a B.A. and very few prospects for careers I'd have found personally compelling.  Point being; I traded an extra year of school (and a fair bump in my loan obligations) for a huge amount of quantitative background and experience, and exponentially more satisfying set of career options. The only conceivable reason I can find for not making this particular trade would be if my dad had somehow lost the ability to work, and I'd have needed to graduate ASAP to help support my family.  On the other hand, though; data science is a hugely multidisciplinary field (I'm researching DS methods under a Neuroscientists and a Physicist, studying microbio and genetics, using approaches mostly from CS with some Stats thrown in). You could probably get an adequate background for a Master's in Data Science, Stats, or some other field with as few as 1 to 2 specific DS courses, and a strong quantitative background from almost any other field.  If getting out a year sooner is valuable to you (and it can be very, very valuable), find a way to slip in one or two classes on the fundamentals, build on those with some personal projects, and go for a Master's if you know this is definitely your career path after you graduate.   If the year isn't as important as the background (or if you're not a self-directed learner) then take the extra year and [VERY IMPORTANT] try to get some relevant research under your belt. I have no professional experience in the field, but it's my understanding that a few impactful publications using machine learning and stats can make the M.S. requirements for a lot of jobs disappear. That saves you money and gets you in the door and up the ranks quite a bit faster.   Your call either way.  side-Note: I want to emphatically point out that the reason I left Philosophy and the poor prospects I would personally have had with it is NOT due to the subject itself. It's probably the single most underrated subject for professional skill-building, and when studied properly I sincerely believe it can open any door that isn't marked ""pure engineering"". I just developed my interests too late to do that properly."

You don't even mention what type of processors are being used. Are you limited to a single core? Secure connections? Any opportunity to run out of memory processes, which is pretty mandatory if limited to 2GB of RAM (I understand that you are aiming for a demographic that may not be very experienced, but I can't remember the last time I encountered less than 2 GB of data.

I've seen job postings saying that they would consider someone with a BS with very strong work experience. These are not entry level jobs, but analogous to senior+ positions.    I have a Masters in mechanical engineering, worked extensively in R/Matlab/Python, and have a year+ experience working with data. I've done multiple machine learning/big data/algorithms courses. I still feel like I'm underqualified until I do some more projects and applied machine learning.   I feel like to get a legit DS job, you need:  -MS/PhD with some experience in research or internships, BS in Computer Science with a couple years experience with data -Strong math background - calc/linear algebra/stats -At least some applied machine learning in a professional setting or a large portfolio of your own projects (school/kaggle/github) -Knowledge of big data technology: Hadoop, Map Reduce, etc. -Be able to be proactive in creating your own projects with little guidance. This is definitely where the experience comes into play.  -Effectively communicate the data in easy to understand visualizations  If you only have a BS, I feel like the likely route is Analyst or Data Engineer -> Data Scientist. Which would mean some stats and coding background."

datascience,35410j,arvi1000,2,Thu May 7 02:24:41 2015 UTC,"Major: depends on the field.  If the major provides a certain level of domain knowledge that can't be provided by some other means, it's a definite factor obvi. Internship: same as major, but also depends on where.  Previous experience should reflect where a candidate is looking to go. Level of knowledge: depends on the current team.  In general, advanced stats, machine learning, and operational fluency in R/Python.  Know a way to test a hypothesis and have the means to carry it out. Be able to prototype, iterate, and deliver quickly.  Integrating with a dev team also comes into play.  Personally I think divergent thinking (or diagonal, abstract, etc.) is hugely important.  There's a fine line between seeing all the solutions to a problem to consider and not knowing which one to choose, but if a data scientist can dance along that line comfortably, said data scientist is the unicorn.  IMO."

I like a 200 level Biochem survey course with a B more than a 100 ""Gen Ed Life Science"" with an A.  I want to see Logic 101, a few stats courses, and evidence of the ability to conduct library research and write a summary / abstract / 3 page research proposal.  Research Methods!  Coding --- good to know, but the world is evolving so rapidly I'd rather see someone with good coursework pedigree than an ace programmer.  I won't turn down a programming ace, but I don't want to hire an undergrad to do that.  Rather I hire experienced coders who know how to manage code libraries, very adept at macros, and can keep ahead of the business needs with regard to organization, documentation, and ability to repurpose code.  Be able to tell stories about what you've accomplished, and demonstrate that you are a continuous learner.  Internships are good but with the job market for the past 5 years I would put more emphasis on available to start next week without haggling over the funds to relocate you to my city.  I expect to pay a low starting salary and slope your compensation by performance.  I'll pay double to hire the PhD, but I will hold the PhD to a higher bar with regard to level of knowledge, and the annual percentage increase will be lower for the average PhD as compared to a heavy hitting newly minted undergrad.

Also it's 40 hours vs 60+ hours on the private side which makes a huge difference.   There are definitely jobs here starting in the low to mid $100k but most of them require you to be a cleared professional.

And what type of background you need for that type of job?   4) Do you think it's good idea to work in industry for a decade or so, and then go into government or do they tend to ignore that experience in favor of government experience.

I was in the military so I'm sure that background didn't hurt, but I also had an internship at Bureau of Labor Statistics so practical government experience with data as well.   Tough to say about govt to private or vice versa. My plan is to hit that retirement eligibility and then jump to the private side. Unless I can break into the upper ranks of govt along the lines of asst directors or commissioner. Or jump private if the right opportunity presents itself.   As for clearance stuff, it's all about access to secure data. No specific background needed you just have to pass a background investigation. They get more insense as the level increases (secret, top secret, TS w/ poly...).   That's where the real money is at, clearance level.

I have a very similar sentiment which I discussed in an earlier post in the sub, albeit phrased more sensitively to the community lol (that's another thing, obviously since data science is so 'special', there will be data scientists who feel especially as such.  I agree with you on the matter of a data analyst with strong domain knowledge being able to (or at least should be able to) accurately sift through messy data.  This obviously coincides with knowing what questions to ask.    However, I think that what distinguishes data science from your run of the mill data analysis is that there are tools that validate a data scientist's hypothesis.  Advanced statistics, natural language processing, recommendation systems - I can't imagine an analyst needing all those in a toolbox, whereas a data scientist (or someone hiring a data scientist) might want all those tools accessible.  Also, data science entails handling incredibly large datasets - TBs of data.  In these cases, R/Python and the like are so much more convenient than tools like Excel.  Personally, I think data scientists are slowly replacing business intelligence analysts, growth analysts, etc.  They're more 'what don't we know yet?' whereas analysts are more 'does what we know still apply?'  On the other hand, in companies that aren't looking to make room for data scientists - I agree, their data analysts should have the capability to do extensive analysis to leverage data.  As those companies aren't looking for Data Science, they probably look for analysts with broader capabilities.  Eventually, the aspects of ds that are 'exclusively ds' like language processing, machine learning - I believe all those will eventually transition into domain-centric areas where a finance company hires someone with a finance background and experience with language processing.  Essentially, the slope in the learning curve will start to lessen as the rest of the job market 'catches up to data science'.  Where is the art?  I'm trying to find the answer to this myself.  So far, I think the art is in the domain.  If you want to get meta about it, a part of data science is about digging through data to reach critical insights.  Obviously this is used in fields like medicine, finance.  Obviously.  I think the art lies in applying methods in data science to areas that haven't yet been disrupted by it.  Are works of literature, particularly poetry and lyrics, more appealing when the range of vowels used is more consistent?  Do certain fragrances sell better from brand to brand?  The weird questions.  That's where data science should be.  I think the art is in the questions asked - but not about the data, but about the data where the data hasn't been explored/leveraged yet."

Once you get past the basics like what's RAM, what are SSDs, how does L2 cache size matter, nobody will care.   Knowing the command linux and basic linux stuff will be much more useful, since in many jobs you'll actually have to log into linux servers and running stuff.

This whole episode gives me a really unprofessional impression, and makes me not want to recommend that my friends apply in the future. I mean, I understand that you have lots of applicants.

Not to come off too bitter, but it almost feels like they just selected the applicants who already had a super strong core in data science tools.    I know it took me working the entire 5 days to finish the challenge questions which was mostly spent on frantically learning how to get the huge csv files into a format I could work with and then scrambling to figure out a project idea and make some 'non trivial' plots.  My gf in an attempt to cheer me up told me that they probably just select people who already have the ability to get a data science job so they can make money off selling them to companies as easily as possible.  If that's what they're doing it runs counter with what they portray their program as.  I can't think of any other explanation for how they could have expected the challenge questions to only take 3-4 hours for a phd without a strong programming/data science background."

I mean, it's nice that they provided links to datasets, but it's still a lot of work to pick something and commit to doing it, then find something good to show and write about at short notice. I took a solid 12 hours (or more) total on it. But I guess the hecticness and challenge aspect comes with the territory? It put a bit of a damper on my holiday though.  I agree that they probably keep in mind how 'sellable' candidates are to their hiring partners. However, going on what I had seen others do for their analyses, the majority wasn't anything too sophisticated. Certainly nothing at the professional data science level, or even utilizing advanced machine learning. It seems they wanted you to at least be able to read in data into a database environment (be it within R/Matlab/Python/SQL whatever), and be able to slice the data and make simple plots of reasonable associations. And then write about it and make a confident elevator pitch. phew  I don't know what anyone's situation is, but for sure don't feel bad. Applying felt a lot like applying for grad school. They had 2-3000 applicants and had <50 fellowships? I guess you learn a lot from applying and are always in much better shape the next cycle. It would be nice if they were more on-to-it with letting people know they weren't accepted, but once again feels a lot like grad school apps.  Hearing from people who've done it (or Insight), it seems like a good time and a great learning opportunity if you can get through. But my impression is that it's by no means the only breakthrough into professional data science."

datascience,34x90k,srkiboy83,5,Tue May 5 09:14:54 2015 UTC,"I generally agree with the advice in this article, except the part about homework.  A lot of developers and data scientists do contracting work at between $100 - $150/hr.  If you require a homework assignment that will take a couple of hours, you're effectively asking them to fork over $300-$500 worth of work for a product nobody is actually interested in, just for the privilege of interviewing with your company.  I get contacted by recruiters for data scientist positions a few times per week.  They pitch me on their company and I talk about my background and skills - maybe answer a few technical-ish questions.  Around a third of them require me to do a homework assignment to continue in the interview process... while I could be interested in a job with these companies, I often don't have enough knowledge of the company and day-to-day work to make that assessment at this point in the interview.  So, you want me to commit over $500 worth of my time for something I'm not convinced I would even want.  A better approach, in my opinion, is to rely on questions asked during an in-person interview.  When I've been interviewing candidates, I've been trying a few basic ""fizzbuzz"" questions during the phone screen: really basic questions, where I'm not looking for any quantitative response but just a general understanding of data science concepts/methods/caveats (this came after we had an in-person interview with a data science candidate who legit didn't know what regression was).  For an in-person interview, ask the candidate to submit code samples from projects they've worked on, and try to test the candidate on why they made certain decisions (e.g., you used SVM for this project, did you evaluate any other algorithms?  Could decision trees have worked for this?  How did you choose your kernel? etc).  Alternatively, I've seen a few companies require you to give a presentation on a topic of your choosing to the entire data team (~10 people)... so, it's in a domain you're familiar with, and not a random problem you're trying to both wrap your head around and solve simultaneously.  This is in line with the author's suggestion, but instead of asking the candidate to complete new work for you, it just relies on work they've previously done.  After all, if they are intelligent people (as we're assuming given the guiding principles), we should give them every opportunity to shine."
datascience,34x90k,not-a-ginger,11,Tue May 5 14:17:44 2015 UTC,"I did a data science interview that involved a homework assignment, and I actually thought it was one of the better uses of my time in the interviewing process (in addition to being a good way to screen candidates in a more realistic setting than a whiteboard). Of all my interviews, the one with homework gave me the best understanding of what the work and the data would really be like at that company."
datascience,34x90k,bonniemuffin,1 point,Tue May 5 15:11:30 2015 UTC,"How did you feel it gave you a good understanding of the work and data?  The homeworks that I've seen are often using related datasets, but either the problem has already been solved by the team, is a set of basic stats/CS questions, or they're asking you to do free labor (I recall one food delivery startup which used to assign potential designers homework to write CSS for a different menu, then reject the candidate but incorporate their code into their product).  I, personally, haven't come across a homework assignment which I've felt to be more insightful than talking to the team about their work and style."
datascience,34x90k,not-a-ginger,8,Wed May 6 03:06:53 2015 UTC,"I mean, what's the difference between a 2 hour homework assignment plus an interview, and a lengthy interview that takes half a day?  I would be surprised to go through a process like that as a new grad, but a 30 something senior data scientist can't spare 2 hours for a job search?  They probably aren't very interested..."
datascience,34x90k,cubby13579,6,Tue May 5 14:48:02 2015 UTC,"I am a 30 something senior data scientist, not a new grad :)  There are two differences for me:  First, I'm not convinced that I'm interested in a position that a random recruiter has pitched me.  A job interview is a dialogue and, as the author stated, should reserve time for the candidate to ask questions.  An interview also provides direct insight into the kinds of people and problems you'd be working on.  I interviewed a while ago at a pretty well-known data company, and during the interview learned that 2 of my 5 interviewers were actively looking for a job... that greatly informed my decision about whether or not to continue to the interview process, and is something I wouldn't have gleaned from a stock homework assignment.  In a way, you're right - I'm not that interested in this position.  But YOUR recruiter reached out to ME, and it's very possible I COULD be interested in the job if I'm given the opportunity to really understand who you are and what you're doing.  If you put a few hour hurdle in front of me, I'm likely to just pass despite it potentially being a great fit.  Second, you can tell a candidate to only spend 1-2 hours on a homework assignment, but you can't guarantee it'll take only that long.  Executing a project well requires a lot of attention to details that discussing a solution in an interview doesn't.  If I really want to impress someone with a homework assignment, I want to actually fix problems with source data, fully evaluate models, and make sure my code sparkles.  And, having been on both sides of the interview table, while you can encourage people to only spend a few hours on a project, you will still be more impressed with the candidate who spend 12 hours and had a kick-ass final product than someone who spent 2 hours and only answered the core of the question.  At that point, you're no longer measuring their aptitude as a data scientist, but rather the amount of free time they have to commit to this project.  As I said above, I think it's better to use projects that people have done on their own.  Maybe it's a work project you're proud of (obviously not infringing on trade secrets), a school project, or a side/just-for-fun project.  That way you executed something you're interested in, you did it to a point that you feel comfortable with, and you're not just building something to discard after the interview.  It seems much more respectful of the candidate's time, and is likely to allow them to show off their capabilities and not be as confounded with how much free time they have."
datascience,34x90k,not-a-ginger,1 point,Tue May 5 17:58:48 2015 UTC,"All good points.  Considering how valuable your time is, your detailed input is appreciated even that much more!  As for the level of commitment, you'd probably have to use your own judgment to decide if you're interested enough in the role to do a homework assignment.  Sure, there would need to be a higher level of interest on my part to want to put in the time just for a chance.  But if it's the right place or the right role...."
datascience,34x90k,greatluck,3,Tue May 5 20:33:22 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to come off as sounding like I'm uber important, because I'm definitely not.  I just think that if you don't value your own time, nobody else will - and it kinda shows in interviews.  It's the same phenomenon as how the person who rejected you is always the one you're obsessed with :p.  I also have a job, and am generally happy with my position (but I've been here for a few years, and recognize there are new and exciting challenges out there).  So, if you don't have a job, are trying to switch fields, or need to leave your current position, and the new company seems interesting enough, then do whatever they ask.  For me, there are a couple of companies (and certain teams: e.g., Facebook data science team is not the same as Facebook's core data science team) where I'd kill for a job there.  So, yeah, I'll call in sick to my job to make sure I do an awesome job on their assignment.  But, for the thousands of startups out there that I've never heard of?

datascience,34x90k,not-a-ginger,1 point,Tue May 5 20:52:24 2015 UTC,"What is with the assumption that the process be the same for a senior data scientist position as a entry level ""data scientist""?  If a recruiter is sending emails/linkedin messages to senior data scientists for more junior ""data scientist"" position that says more about the cluelessness of the recruiter than anything else.  Shouldnt the process be different for senior roles where it should focus more on projects you have done since it is a fair assumption you should have had a project as an employee compared take home projects which assess your potential for doing projects.  Not every candidate is going to have a side project that is directly ""data science"" and not every candidate who has a side project will be better than one without. A small project isnt that big an issue especially if you emphasize that one shouldnt spend too much time on it and allow time to ask the candidate what he/she would do if he/she had more time so that it serves as an assessment and a jumping point to judge candidates on the same control set. Data scientist should be familiar with science and good science tries to control for variables one doesnt want to bias the result."
datascience,34x90k,maxToTheJ,4,Tue May 5 23:10:10 2015 UTC,"You make a really good point. I think a homework assignment matters much more for entry-level data science people, those who are just of out getting their Master's or PhD, or who don't have an advanced degree and have been in the field for under 5 years. Once people have enough experience, their time becomes too valuable to necessarily be able to complete a homework assignment for every job they apply to.   I like the idea that if you have previous research or code samples (ex. a project on GitHub) to ask about that. I think previous projects are a much better example of what someone is capable of than complex technical questions in a stressful interview setting."

I'm a little hesitant to just put my screening questions out there, as I have interviewed a few candidates sourced from reddit before.  On the other hand, if you're dedicated enough to figure out my username and read this comment, then I guess that says something too :p  I work for a electronic health record company (obviously, my reddit account is my own and doesn't necessarily reflect my employer's views), and we've slowed down hiring a bit recently so I've only asked a handful of candidates my latest iteration.  I try to ask health-related questions which a candidate could find interesting but they could answer with any data experience... and I don't ask for quantitative responses, just general ideas of how you'd approach the problem:  [edit: sorry, removing these because I'm using them in interviews]  Generally those three questions, a few get to know you questions (I really like asking who they look up to - and if anybody mentions their love of John Myles White or Tom Dale, you can bet they'll get my thumbs up :p), and time for them to ask questions takes up 30 minutes.

datascience,34x90k,not-a-ginger,1 point,Wed May 6 02:58:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer. I appreciate the time you took to write all this out.   I used to try to find a resume item and get them to explain it to me. A large part of what we have to do on my team is communicate technical work to audiences with varied backgrounds, translate from a business problem to a research problem and then translate results back to a business answer. So I want to see if they can explain something to me that they understand really well that I don't know anything about. But that was really difficult to use to compare between candidates and was also generally time consuming.   So now I ask something that's eerily similar to your #2 and I'm basically looking for any kind of concrete stats knowledge (I see a lot of data science applicants who know the scikit-learn api, but don't know any basic stats). I am also trying to work out a good question about validation. I feel like you can get a sense of someone's experience and depth if they have something worthwhile to say about the validity of their models. But I haven't really homed in on how to accomplish that. So I try to pose a simple classification question and the goal of that question is mostly to quickly get to the part where I ask how they check if their answer is any good. Then I say: ok, so let's say you do all that and the results are terrible, now what?"
datascience,34x90k,WallyMetropolis,2,Wed May 6 03:48:35 2015 UTC,"Interesting - I read a while ago about an interview technique where you ask candidates to explain any concept they want to you in 5 minutes.  You set a clock, and interact with them throughout... the signs of a good communicator are if they assess your base knowledge of the topic, if they assess if you're following their explanation, and if you throw out a question that's slightly off-topic they're able to redirect you back on track.  I've tried this in a few in-person interviews (particularly more customer-facing roles), and found it to be somewhat insightful (although, if the candidate doesn't pick a good topic, it can be of limited use).  I agree about assessing models as a proxy for experience/depth.  I've heard of some companies asking questions (more in-person than phone screen) about interpreting ROC curves - like, if you have two curves that have the same AUC, but they're shaped differently... when might you choose one model over another.  Also, the models that candidates choose to solve problems is somewhat interesting - I like when candidates understand that sometimes having an easily explained model (e.g., regression) that doesn't perform as well is better than a black box model which performs better, if only because oftentimes stakeholders want to know why a model is making certain predictions."

The trick is that you will never get anywhere going through HR. You have to do the hard work of figuring out what company you want to work with, who the hiring managers are, and who your colleagues would be. Then ask them specifically what it would take. HR will never bend the rules so if you're not a traditional candidate, you have to go around the rules. A hiring manager has a huge amount of pull if they really want you into their group. Use this to your advantage."

Equally important is how prepared you are to talk to them, how needy you come across, how much you make it clear that it's an informational informal interview, and what you can give them in return. Cold emailing is acceptable.  Any social network / blog / etc will have interesting people in it doing interesting things. As long as you are genuinely interested in what they are doing, have proof of your interest, and have a very small ask most people would readily reply to a cold email.  The key is to be on point, and have a tiny ask. Not give me a job.

By starting a business you are saying you want to run a business rather than doing data science. Sure it sounds sexy and doable, but you have to really understand what you are doing. For a very long expository explanation of this read the ""The E-myth"" books as well as any article related to it.  .  If you really want to start a company/firm of data scientists that can analyze data for ""customers"", then you have to find one customer.

Like /u/orangeoctopus mentions ""getting customers to actually want to work with you is the hardest part."" This is 100% correct. Doing the data science will be the easy part.

I still find myself reverting back to R even though I know python is for ""real"" programmers.  What I ended up doing was taking a few easy R tasks and doing their equivalent in Python. You might try doing the same in reverse just to work on your programming polyglot skills."

Most employers would appreciate knowing both, but I'm a python fanboy and I'm stubborn about learning new languages because I'm now more focused on deeper knowledge rather than breadth. I would do better to learn R sooner than later.   If you're asking about which is better, I think they're both well packed with features. I have the preference for Python because I already played with it a lot using beautifulsoup, making bots for reddit/twitter, making games in pygame, etc. it's just THE general scripting language.   I hear that R has some web scraping package too, and of course they're both professional toolsets of choice. The plotting module for python is oftentimes defaulted to matplotlib, but people can choose to use more fancy modules that build on top of matplotlib such as seaborn which I haven't yet used but it definitely looks purty.  Either way, open source is good."

You'd probably be better served either doing a survey of a topic or doing an applied project. I wouldn't expect an undergrad to be doing field-expanding research. Talk to your advisor to figure out a reasonable scope for your thesis. In fact, you'd probably be better served coordinating with a faculty advisor than just asking us since they'll have a better feel for your skill set and, if you've taken classes with them before, your interests as well.  Anyway, here are some contemporary hot areas you might be interested in researching:   Developing a language for analytics/visualization to standardize and simplify the process across platforms.    Grammar of Graphics Tidy Data Framework Predictive Modeling Markup Language  Model ""compression"" to reduce the complexity of large models  (i.e. the space on disk and time to produce results), particularly deep-learned models and ensembles   Geoffrey Hinton's Dark Knowledge  Technologies for abstracting data referenced in an analysis away from their physical storage, with an aim to generalizing analyses and making them more easily scalable/parallelizable.

Did you check those out? Let me know if you still have questions after thumbing through those a bit. It's an approach/attitude that Hadley Wickham in particular has been championing for a few years now.  No, I don't think undergrad is too soon to start learning about machine learning from an algorithmic perspective. Andrew Ng's machine learning coursera course is a great survey of important algorithms and topics if you have time for some self-study.   If you want to really get into the weeds, I strongly suggest taking linear algebra, probability and statistics as a foundation before studying statistical learning methods (aka machine learning)."

Another DSL for visualization you should include in your research is Vega, which builds (limited) interactive d3 visualizations using a declarative syntax. I don't know if any articles have been published about Vega, and unfortunately searching for them will probably be hard because of the star with the same name.  You should probably do some research on DSL design in general, but I don't have any choice citations to send your way in that domain.

For example, you use # of comments and # of votes to ""predict"" view count, but you would have no way of knowing these two features when the video is published. Those two features are actually very good proxies of view count because a video with a high view count is more likely to have a high number of comments and votes.  I suspect if you did a variable importance on your random forest model, you would see that those two features are the most important, and if you remove them, your model would not be able to predict nearly as well."

I generally look at the results, and if they seem too good to be true, they usually are. I've dealt with my fair share of data leakage too.  I think your methodology is fine, but I think your ability to get a good result is heavily constrained by the lack of good features in your data set. All you really know is the category of the video and the runtime, and I would imagine there is a whole host of other factors that would affect how many views a video gets. Looking at the dataset, my personal opinion is that there is not enough meat there to really make a solid prediction, even if you use some of the features that you eliminated."

I changed my conclusion and I too noted how perhaps there is not enough data here - features I mean. Porn stars i.e. actors/actresses in a video would probably help with the model, as would the hour of upload (only the date was available), and information about the thumbnail. I have thumbnail information for a separate dataset but I don't have nearly enough ram or space to process it.  At best, it is possible to infer which pornstar is in which video through the title or description by matching it with a database of names, but that's also more effort than it's worth."

You can use the number of votes/views as the ""true"" label (say three view categories, like: little, medium, a lot). That is, you know the ""true"" answer after many months or years. But you can't use these in your prediction, as you wouldn't know them right away. So you use the ""true"" labels to classify videos, then see if any combination of other variables (one that you would know right away) give you a good separation among these three categories.   For me, I used total posts and reputation as ""user quality"", then tried to see whether I could predict the quality of a user based on their first five posts only."

datascience,34d9wn,jc_315,9,Thu Apr 30 05:36:48 2015 UTC,"I work as a data scientist in a tech firm  There are essentially 3 things that they want to see in a typical Data Scientist.   Quantitative Skills Process Familiarity + Coding Business Knowledge + Communication Skills Quantitative Skills this is the bucket that i see everybody focus WAY too much on. Yes it's important to have a strong quantitative background but you have to understand that most data scientist roles are looking for outcomes that can be applied. In 99% of firms, their data, problems, and operations don't lend themselves to create problems that are only solvable or interpretable by people with PhD's or even Masters.     The results are also not rigorous.  no one's looking for a proof or precision.  A lot of the times, the problems they're looking for are actually very simple mathematically and statistically but just have to do with large amounts of data.   Process Familiarity + Coding This is usually understated. Companies have different ways of storing and collecting their data. It doesn't help them at all if you are really good at analyses once given a dataset. It matters to them that you know how to create those datasets in the first place. This process is called ETL ( Extract Transform Load ). You need to be familiar with the major data frameworks such as MongoDB, Hive, Pig, Map Reduce, etc.   Your skills are no use unless you have to data to operate on and nobody's going to hire an extra person just to do that.    Your skills are also useless if you cant apply them which is where coding languages like Python, R, Matlab, and SQL come in.   Business Knowledge and Communication Skills   This is the MOST IMPORTANT thing that I feel people don't understand about the data scientist role.  Yes, you code but you're not a software engineer. What does that mean? That means you don't have a product to show for your work you have analyses and results. This means that you need to be able to translate all your findings and stuff to people who are not technical at all.  Nobody cares if your model is 99% accurate if you can't explain to them how it works and what are the driving factors.  This point alone reduces the level of quantitative knowledge needed for a data scientist role.  Sure, you can use models such as SVMs, Neural Networks, etc to predict ARR and you may be accurate. BUT, the sales VP wants to have a model that is able to be inferenced so he can know okay, these are the driving factors of ARR, i just need to increase these or fix these and i'll have more.  My advice is to start coding more, worry less about quantitative knowledge, and get better at your communication skills.  You need to be able to explain to people who have a math background of no higher than algebra what your stuff means."
datascience,34d9wn,Serang,3,Thu Apr 30 17:14:26 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to follow up on this, because I agree SO MUCH that communication skills are essential, frequently overlooked, and even more frequently a cause of issues when attempting to find a job.  Serang is spot-on about the importance of being able to translate your findings to non-technically-minded people.    I would be willing to bet that the people who are interviewing for DS positions, but unable to actually secure a position, frequently have subpar communication skills."
datascience,34d9wn,Teigue,3,Thu Apr 30 18:17:01 2015 UTC,"Also agreeing with this.  I've made passes on hiring data scientists who over-index on the quantitative side because they can't effectively communicate and translate their ideas.  The way I think about it -- many data scientists these days are working in a team.  There's a whole breadth of skills necessary to ""cover the bases"" -- this is a solve for the fact that rarely do you have one data scientist that encapsulates all skills.  If these data scientists aren't communicating well with each other, that model breaks down.  Another area which is important is how that information is being communicated out.  Insights are products for some data science groups, so if this person can't drive an insight to action, there's a big problem."

Python is pretty vital so 3 years of that is a huge plus, and getting into R was the right move, but outside of OR jobs, Matlab usually doesn't sell very well. If you don't have any experience applying your skills to business, I would recommend getting into Kaggle - then you can get experience with business problems without having to get hired in business (which requires experience with business problems, and so on and so forth...).    Additionally, what types of databases and infrastructures do you have experience with? My more research/academic background candidates sometimes lack any experience with SQL, Hadoop, AWS, etc. Without solid SQL skills, that knocks out 90% of the job opportunities that I see. Hadoop and AWS will be requirements for at least half of them too.    Finally, I'm not sure where to turn for this (and I mean no offense), but I would try to find someone who can coach you on interviews or evaluate how you're coming across. If you've gone in for 6 in persons and aren't getting anywhere, there's a good chance there's something off about the way you're presenting. I don't know you, so I have no idea, but the few academics that I've seen go in for interviews have blown it by being... well... to academic. Businesses don't want to see academic rigor and 100% accurate results, they want to see someone who will get the most business value out of the data in the least amount of time and using as few resources as possible. The Pareto Principle is your best friend in business. I've had hiring managers tell me that all else equal, they try to avoid PhDs because of the rigor of their approach and methods. Be practical above all else. And good luck!"
datascience,34d9wn,RocketSurgeon85,1 point,Mon May 4 17:21:51 2015 UTC,"Hi,   First off thanks for taking the time to reply.  After reading your message, what I have found to be a common theme from both you and a friend of mine are that I have most likely been too detailed and focused too much on my work, rather than what I can bring to the business. In fact, the same guy said he'd run me through an informal ""mock"" interview. I've never had a problem being a good technical communicator, and an easy person to get along with, but I certainly lack a level of business communication style.   Working up your list, I work mostly in HDF5, which is a more academic type of file format. I do have some basic SQL experience, and am learning it more. As for Hadoop, and AWS, I don't know those systems. I'm not terribly sure how to get experience with either. I don't really have the necessary funds to purchase AWS time, and don't have access to a hadoop cluster.   I plan on starting some of the simple Kaggle problems soon, once a bit of a storm of work priorities pass by. I generally try to broadcast my python skills up front on my resume, and am very forward about python being 50% of my day-to-day. MATLAB stays on the resume, as I see it as a desirable on the occasional job posting, but I have nearly abandoned it entirely for python.   Datawise, I work with very large amounts of time series data which also has 2 spatial components (my group studies automotive fuel sprays with extremely high fidelity experiments), and larger amounts of image data of the internal operation of fuel injectors. We are looking to get very detailed measurements of how sprays break down and how the internal design of nozzles affects this. With the data, the end goal is to exploit novel geometries and the way the fuel is injected to maximize combustion efficiency (fuel economy), and minimize emissions.  Again, thanks a whole bunch for the tips. I sincerely appreciate it.  As a quick P.S., do you work with clients in the Chicago Area at all. My goal is to stay in the area if I can."

I believe you can do it online so you could stay in Chicago, and it's free (if you can get accepted) - they survive by placing graduates at partnered organizations.     P.S., do you work with clients in the Chicago Area at all. My goal is to stay in the area if I can     I work on positions nationwide. However, the Data Science market in Chicago isn't the hottest. I'm working with one firm in the area right at the moment. I'm not sure that would be a fit for your situation, but why don't you connect with me on LinkedIn (pm for more info).

Almost all of the technology is open source, and it's really hard to make any profit off the software sale and support. So it's all about the consulting services and generating demand.  To do Data Science right you need PhD mathematicians. You can do it wrong for a lot less money. The math that underpins DS is in eye-bleed complexity territory. If you think you want to study this for a career and big money...stop now. It's easier to become a Navy Seal.  Big Data and Data Scientists are the next iteration of something that has tried to succeed for 30 years. As long as I've been doing it since the late 70's. The difference now is that computers are cheaper and faster, and the software is mostly free.   People are still expensive and that won't change. CEO's tend to go ""non-linear"" when signing off invoices for nerds with C Level salary demands. They want to know what they are getting in return, and the reality is it's rocket science and the average MBA doesn't understand rocket science very well.  So they tend to reject it.

datascience,34anul,riders994,2,Wed Apr 29 17:11:16 2015 UTC,"What you did makes sense to me.  You defined your feature space as all possible words in your adwords campaign and for each observation (ad), set each feature (word) as 1 or 0 depending on whether that particular word was in the ad.  Then you regressed against a value metric that you defined.  Is that right?  If you want to add word combinations (bigrams, trigrams, etc.), just define them and add them to your feature space as well.  In other words, you would have variables to represent every unigram (which you already do), and in addition you would have variables to represent every bigram, trigram, etc. depending on how far you want to go.  This will result in a very high dimensional space though, so you will probably want to do some feature selection and retain only those variables that actually have predictive value.

I'll be honest, I might not have a full handle on what exactly ""data science"" is.  I've read articles on the field, reddit posts from data scientists on the stuff they are doing, even taken some courses from MOOCs like Udacity.  But still, I've never worked as one or under one, so maybe I'm just talking out of my ass.  But if I had to put it in one word, it's ""prediction"".  For example, in the legal field, one area where data analysis is being utilized is trying to predict settlement amounts companies end up having to pay out for specific wrongdoings.  This information would be useful for insurance companies.  I also enjoyed the stuff Nate Silver did with politics.  And sports analytics, trying to predict outcomes.  Basically my interests encompass a lot of different areas - sports, politics, economics, finance, law, etc.  But I am super intrigued by the possibility of using data intelligently to make predictions.

When you get to 500 candidates interviewed then you can be excused for telling me something that I already know, and that is immaterial to my prior comment.  When did you last conduct on campus interviews at Stanford?  For me it was near 10 years ago, because although it is a great program, their graduates are ""stickey"" to the west coast, and I can't keep my best west coast hires on the east coast for more than a few years.  How many letters of recommendation for high school students did you write in the last 5 years for Stanford, Harvard, and Princeton admissions review?  When your high school interns are gaining admission to Harvard and UPenn, and are competing for Thiel Fellowships, please let me know.  How many of your colleagues have you written letters of recommendation for as they pursue their advanced degrees at schools like Stanford?  How many of your peers from graduate school teach at schools like Stanford?   Are tenured there for life?  For Stanford, I count one of each, and they are the best in their domains, so I know where the bar is at Stanford.

It seems like it's the diploma mills that actually do the MOST advertising.  As far as the prereqs, 2 other online programs - Colorado State and Penn State have similar prereqs but those are applied statistics programs.  Maybe that's the rub with TAMU?

Data analysis is around 50% of your job as a plant process engineer. For process engineers working for an EPC contractor, it would be near zero.  You don't want to pull everything in at once and look for spurious correlations - as process engineers your skills are in understanding the underlying phenonomena, and building models of what is happening, in a way which is not possible with social sciences, genetics etc. So you can fairly easily reduce big data to just plain old data.

By looking at other flows and using temperature measurements elsewhere, missing data can be inferred, and if you're lucky you get enough to give yourself confidence.  There's a huge difference between time scales of phenomena. A reactor can respond to changes in feedstocks in milliseconds, while the temperature of the vessel takes minutes to heat up or cool down; the temperature of the cooling water in the jacket will vary throughout the day; and the composition of feedstocks will vary month by month.

datascience,33yvka,Nixonite,2,Mon Apr 27 09:21:31 2015 UTC,No answers but more questions. Great thread. I've been looking for books about feature generation/engineering everywhere. Unfortunately we are all mathematicians/statisticians so we get stuck in trying to automate the process and find the structured way and so there's tons of books about feature/variable selection - theories on how to choose among the variables once their constructed. That's like a 'get rich'-book explaining what to do with all the money. As we're not automated yet I think most would agree that what really gets the job done at this point is more intuition and experience.  So I'd want to read the lofty- experience- based books. More from a Zen-perspective than a mathematicians. Maybe someone can just record a rambling data-scientist and e-mail it to me?

I learned SQL from the Stanford online course which was considerably more difficult than their questions and I was familiar with Python, I learned R from Coursera.  The interview process was asking me about problems and how I would solve them (like how to recommend a product etc.) and asking me about statistics/ML stuff like bootstrapping - I'd used all of that in my Masters project in Comp. Neurosci. so it was fairly easy.  There were a few brainteasers as well to do with binary trees etc. but again that was much easier than Roughgarden's coursera course.

I only got 8 interviews and scraped in 2 offers at the tail end. I work in condensed soft matter theory, so I have a decent stats background and solid programming ability, but nothing amazingly data science oriented. I really think the reason I got offers towards the end is that I stopped feeling like an impostor and instead just acted very confident, even if I didn't feel that way. The fact is that you can learn on the job, but nobody wants to hear that you intend to.

datascience,33t7ya,remram,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:29:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed comments and suggestions. I will try to address some of the issues you raised below.   Why not make a fnameGen from prefix and suffix, so you can use the same code?   Because when at least one of prefix/suffix is supplied, I can do a glob, followed by a natural sort and jump over gaps. I cannot do that if the names are generated via a function.   Apart from the PEP8 violation, why rename import names? This is an internal module...   Valid point. Initially, all the code sat in __init__.py and I had to do this to ensure that these didn't get accidentally exported. When I moved towards testing, I had to refactor it out to a separate module anyway.  However, I was unable to work out exactly which PEP8 recommendation I was violating. Could you please point out the exact violation?   Why create a lambda you'll only use once?   Because I was using it again for the regexp matching here:   selectFilesRegEx = _re.compile(prefix + '[0-9]+' + suffix + '$')   However, since the backspaces in absolute paths led to incorrectly escaped regexs on Windows, I resorted to matching only the basenames, which should contain only regex friendly characters. That standalone lambda can be done away with.   numberedFiles = [ f for f in allFiles if _re.search(selectFilesRegEx, f) ]   You don't need to match that regexp with every single entry, since you only use the last one anyway. ... I don't think you need this _getStrBetween() function: you just matched what you need with the regex. Use the group() method.   Consider the case if you have files foo.1, foo.bar, foo.2, foo.4. All of these will be matched by the glob and foo.bar will be the last file in the list. We have to explicitly filter it out before finding out the largest element in the sequence. You are correct that I don't need the _getStrBetween() function and I could save the results of _re.search() and use that instead.   I'm pretty sure this should be TypeError.   That is an interesting point. I wasn't able to figure out which error it should be and resorted to RuntimeError as a safe fallback. Could you point me to an example where incorrect arguments raise a TypeError?   This looks kind of slow.   If a functional name generator is all that is provided, then we cannot do any faster than this. The recommended use is via the prefix and suffix arguments, when we can glob for the files.   But aren't you better off using one common generator from all your threads instead? In what situation do you concurrently generate filenames in the same folder of the same machine? (and can't you just use high-precision timestamps then, allowing for easy merging of different machines?)   I often run two separate interactive processes in different screens which do not share any resources explicitly. In that case, I am using the filesystem as the shared resource to acquire a lock. The filesystem continues to be a valid resource when moving to multi-threaded programs as well. That is what I like about this approach.  You are correct that this doesn't solve the problem when running the same code across machines and collecting the output. In that case, the prefix/suffix will need to contain some machine specific bits to ensure that files could be safely collected.   Also, this is definitely not unicode safe on Python 2.   This is also interesting and something I can definitely add tests for. Could you please point out which parts are not Unicode safe so I can test them explicitly?    Did I understand your questions correctly? Did I leave anything unaddressed?  And thanks again for the detailed critique. :)"

The biggest value, by far, is the network/access it provides (even if you could get a data science job without Insight it would still probably be worth going).  I don't think any of the other data science bootcamps compare in this regard.  Most of the learning is self-directed rather than structured, but it turns out that it's also really easy to learn when you are around a bunch of smart, motivated people.  However, it's somewhat more difficult to find good data science jobs now than it was when the program began.  At least a few of the partner companies that have historically hired a lot of Insight fellows are no longer actively recruiting through the program.

The office is always open to you, and you can ask for advice/feedback, socialize, study, whatever.  Working on projects is mostly done in the first 4-5 weeks of the program.

datascience,33k8bv,137point036,1 point,Sun Apr 26 04:41:18 2015 UTC,"I did the program back in 2013, so things may have changed slightly.  My general sentiment is that if you're experienced and talented enough to make it into Insight, you really don't need the program to get a job in data science. I didn't really learn much in the program, but having weeks to prepare for job interviews and focus on developing a project I could show off was useful. It's nothing you couldn't do on your own, provided you had some people willing to give mock interviews and to give you feedback as you work on some data project.  It looks like they don't even offer a stipend for living expenses anymore. Which I guess is slightly more honest than claiming to offer one, but only for people that accept jobs with certain ""mentor"" companies. But a lot of people got burned by that, since living in Silicon Valley is not cheap.  One thing I'll point out is they claim ""100% of Fellows who completed the job search found work in a data-related role within 3-4 months of completing the program"". First of all, 3-4 months is a long time to be searching for work when you add the additional 2 months you're in the program. And they don't say how many of those jobs were actually found with Insight's help. I don't have any more experience than my own group and some contact with other fellows, but a significant percentage (maybe 25%-50%) of those jobs were found without any help from Insight. If you have bad luck with the mentor companies, you're on your own and basically searching job ads.  I suppose the network might be useful, but I haven't tried job hunting recently to know.  As for finding a place to live, AirBnB was popular in my group. Just be prepared to move around a few times if you go that route."
datascience,33k8bv,csushant,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:06:45 2015 UTC,"Interesting, because we apparently attended around the same time.  Only a handful of people from my session took more than 1-2 months to find a job, and (afaik) almost all of the jobs came from mentor companies.  I know many people from the program who have changed jobs in the last 6-12 months, and in almost all cases they have gone to companies with at least 1 other Insight fellow.  The network really does have a ton of value."
datascience,33k8bv,csushant,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:25:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that answer. Can I ask... for those who did find a job directly through the program, how long did it take? Do you have a good idea by the end of the two months?"
datascience,33k8bv,csushant,2,Fri Apr 24 19:38:31 2015 UTC,"I'd say the fastest was something like 2 weeks after the end of the program. The longest ones were closer to 2 months. That's after the end of the program, so something like 3.5 months total from starting Insight to getting a job offer.  A large social network company, for example, really strung some people in my group along. Interviews were scheduled a week in advance, and it took the recruiter a week to gather feedback after an interview. Multiply that by 3 rounds of interviews, and that's 6 weeks."

I can't really say anything more than ""I like it.""  As for getting more serious about it, it was really all because one data scientist pm'd me after that makeup project, and was super inspiring.

Coursera and other MOOCs will be useful for this. Towards the end of your degree, you should look into doing a fellowship, e.g. Insight or Data Science for Social Good.      Data science is smouldering hot at the moment so provided that you develop the technical skills during your PhD, I'd be very surprised if you'll not be able to land a data science-related job. I think your key difficulty will be convincing employers, etc., that you possess these skills. If they have an applicant with a PhD in maths then they might be very inclined to go for them over someone with a cognitive psychology degree. Then again, there are a lot of data jobs at the moment."

The demand for people with expertise in understanding data is probably not going away any time soon. The thing about the tools that are being developed currently is that they have such broad application that their creators have no way of even attempting to apply them to all situations. A while back, for example, I saw a guy who trained a neural network to regulate a human bladder in a condition where voluntary bladder control was lost. These sorts of applications are endless, so I find it hard to imagine how data specialists are going to be out of a job any time soon (i.e. within the next 10 years; in 20 years I have no clue)."

datascience,335e72,geebr,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:07:20 2015 UTC,"I am a software engineer who is data science curious and have had the opportunity to employ machine learning in my day job, so my perspective comes more from the software industry.  Thus, take it with a grain of salt.  If your goal is to work for business, I would look to have a practical example of your skills in use through either contributions to open source projects or development of your own side project(s).  As you learn R or Python, be active in the open source communities of the tools you are using.  If you find a bug, fix it, contribute the fix back.  Or if you find you wish you could do something that isn't supported, implement it and contribute it back.  When you start to look for a job, make sure these contributions are part of your resume with links so that interviewers could see what you did.  For a side project, take some source of data (there are a ton of them, something like https://www.data.gov/open-gov/) and do something with it.  Analyze Seattle's 911 fire calls to find the patterns and what resources they need at given times of day, day of week, or day of year, make a fancy visualization of it.  This shows you can solve a business problem using what you know.  Make these side projects have a tangible artifact that an interviewer could see -- a URL they can visit, code available in github...  Again, include this on your resume.  Be ready to discuss the problems you encountered and how you moved through them in interviews.  Doing this is something that could really separate you from others looking to break into an industry.  At least that is something that I have seen work well for recent computer science graduates looking to move into the software industry."

Javascript is the language browsers use to make websites dynamic, d3 is a nice library that simplifies loading data and displaying these in an svg for example. I must say d3 takes a bit of getting used to, even if you knew javascript. That said, I've learned javascript and web development through playing around with d3, takes some time though."
datascience,330f5f,iamiamwhoami,2,Sat Apr 18 16:30:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for the clarification. Maybe I'll look into it when I've got some extra time to learn more
datascience,330f5f,SupaFurry,2,Sat Apr 18 17:35:59 2015 UTC,"d3.js visualizations take a lot of time to create and require a lot of CSS/JS expertise if you want a high quality and interactive product. If you have the skillset then it will work well, but you'll still invest a lot of time into the visualization.  Alternatively there's shiny, which leverages R plotting libraries and requires no web development skills. You gain a nice balance of production speed and quality, but you trade in the low-level DOM control you get with d3.js, which is basically just a means-to-an-end that you get with shiny anyway."
datascience,330f5f,SupaFurry,6,Sun Apr 19 06:37:59 2015 UTC,"Tableau software and here's why: 1. super optimized for a bunch of different database systems 2. the gui interface is much much quicker than trying to program a new visualization.  3. You can work with extracts (subsets) of your data to make it quicker  If you combine these, then you can experiment with your data relatively easily without, for the most part, having to worry about external libraries to ease the possible transition in your data, recompile a bunch of code, mentally worry about parameters in visualization, at a relatively fast speed ( there's some magic in the extracts though )."

datascience,332ibf,DeltaPunch,1 point,Sun Apr 19 05:01:24 2015 UTC,"A lot depends on what types of variables you have.  If they are categorical (yes/no, red/green/blue, etc.), you could actually look at a more general statistical approach like logistic regression.  The whole purpose of that is to take some predictor variables and come out with a binary outcome.  In more of an ML approach, you could look at decision trees, or the ensemble version of those, ""random forest"".  Decision trees have the nice benefit that they can be somewhat interpretable (e.g. if A=a1 and B=b2... then yes).  Others have suggested neural networks, and I suspect they would work well here, but the downside is that it's often difficult to figure out what they've done.   every variable is important   You might need to relax this.  As I see it, the whole purpose of these kinds of ML problems is to come up with a model that is simpler than the data itself.  That necessarily means some variables will be less important than others - otherwise, there is no simplification.

They were all fellows and didn't have to pay.  What is taught at Data Incubator can be found in any number of free resources (online courses,  books, blogs, etc). If you are dedicated, you can learn the same stuff on your own. People in the program do a data science project based on some sort of open data, but that is also something you can do on your own. The benefits you will get from going through the program are mostly the people you will meet who are also in the program and the introductions to companies from the people running the program. You would basically be paying for a network. But, a network is critical when getting into a new field, so maybe that would be worth it for you. So, if I were you, before paying for this, I'd be sure I was going to get the same advantages that a fellow would."

In terms of getting treated the same as a fellow: they basically said that if you're as good as a fellow, you have the same chance of getting a job as a fellow. This makes sense, since they get paid by the hiring partners to provide them with employees. So if you're good enough to be hired, it's in their self-interest to get you hired."

datascience,32q1pm,jimothy-,5,Wed Apr 15 20:11:17 2015 UTC,"Data Visualization is a great career choice  Data Visualization is growing as fast, if not faster than data science. Every report / dashboard / end-user-product that has data in it is a ""Data Visualization"". This includes text visualizations, scientific visualizations, maps/cartography, etc. Every company that deals with data (which is ~100% of them), needs someone to communicate what this data does, is, will do, has been doing to those who are not as data-literate as ""data scientists"", ""bi people"", ""data analysts"", etc.  Data Visualization is very popular  Here on reddit, you can see how popular it is by looking at /r/dataisbeautiful which has 2,827,544 readers as of this morning.  You're already a good portion of the way there  Having a graphic/interactive design would put you a leg up in terms of career as you've already had a very good grounding of how to communicate something visually. In the case of data visualization, you are communicating ""Data"" and relationships between variables where it can be a few points to several million data points (""big data visualization"").  Data Visualization is growing due to several forces  The first force is data-driven journalism. News organizations all over the world are moving to telling stories driven by data. This in turn is driving data visualization as a way to tell stories in these news organizations. Venerable institutions like the BBC (http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/in_the_newsroom_1.html) and The New York Times (http://www.nytimes.com/upshot/) are embracing data visualization and story telling like never before. Brand-spanking-new news organizations like 538 (http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/our-33-weirdest-charts-from-2014/) are also getting in on the act and making a big splash.  The second driving force is that very very smart people have been thinking very very hard about how to make very very powerful data visualizations. As a small example, Professor Jeffrey Heer (Berkeley, Stanford, U. Wash & Trifacta) and his lab and students have been thinking about how to make data visualizations. To his and his team and students credit they've developed tools like D3.js (http://d3js.org/), Lyra (http://idl.cs.washington.edu/projects/lyra/), imMens (http://vis.stanford.edu/papers/immens), Vega (http://trifacta.github.io/vega/), as well as a bunch of other ground breaking things.  The third driving force is that HTML5, Canvas, SVG, WebGL, and the web standards in general have allowed the development of data visualization tools to flourish. Thus we get incredibly powerful tools like D3.js (http://d3js.org/), P5.js (http://p5js.org/), and many many many many others (a tiny selection - http://selection.datavisualization.ch/)  The fourth driving force is cartography / map making. This is a giant, powerful, old, and super-useful industry and discipline. Some tools that have popped up are Leaflet (http://leafletjs.com/), Open Street Maps (https://www.openstreetmap.org/), CartoDB (http://cartodb.com/), Mapbox (https://www.mapbox.com/), Google Street Maps, and many many many others.  The fifth driving force is that many of these tools are open source. So you and I and anyone else can go and take a look not only how the library was constructed, but also right click on any web visualization and see what code was used to generated the visualization. D3.js, P5.js, Leaflet.js, etc....  The sixth driving force is that with the browser and DOM events, suddenly you can easily make some amazingly complex, responsive, event-driven, interactive visualizations. This makes it very powerful for exploring models, data, relationships, etc.  The seventh driving force is that since so many of the tools are front-end technologies and open source, many companies are building libraries on top of tools. So you get things like Mozilla building Metrics (https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics), Palantir building Plottable (http://plottablejs.org/), ShutterStock building RickShaw (http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/), and many many many many others.  The eigth driving foce is conferences. Due to the open source and web nature of data viz tools, conferences are a big hit. So conferences like Eyeo (http://eyeofestival.com/), Open Vis Conf (http://openvisconf.com/), O'Reilly Strata (strataconf.com), Malofiej (http://www.malofiejgraphics.com/), IEEE Vis (http://ieeevis.org/), and many many others pop up and help educate the population.  Where to find work, or see what people are hiring for  The general job websites work.  A hidden gem is the following email list => Data Viz Job Group - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/data-vis-jobs  Happy to answer any questions  About, any of the above, bloggers, researchers, tools, techniques, etc..."
datascience,32q1pm,seabass,2,Thu Apr 16 13:23:16 2015 UTC,"Phil Simon's The Visual Organization might be worth checking out, as it talks about visualization as a business need, and the additional need for people that understand data rather than just artists; your background might make you desirable in this regard.

Every office is a little different, but many handle things like enrollment management, which is building models to predict what types of students will attend the institution and how they can be swayed to choose one place over another. Many university admissions offices have positions for that type of work.   You may also look at the IT departments of universities. Data science is the hot topic right now and many IT departments are hiring data scientists. Many schools are integrating all of their data sources and are looking for people to help them pull meaning out of their newly accessible ""big data"".

I never saw much being done outside of the mandatory stuff. Not saying it doesn't happen, but from my experience, the NHS is more than a few years behind with regards to data analysis   That being said, you are completely right, and the potential for Data Scientists is absolutely massive - organisations like NHS England are receiving shed loads of standardised data from all round the country, if anyone is going to have Data Scientist positions opening up, I'd think it would be them"

Actually, one weird thing about this term is also that ""science"" already implies the use of ""data,"" doesn't it?  Since you asked for our opinion, I would group things a little bit differently :). E.g., in the context of ""Data science"", I would have an overlap between Computer Science and Statistics with Machine Learning in between (although it evolved from the field of computer science, it borrows so much from the field of statistics, however, machine learning applications have different goals in both fields). Also, I would  further divide computer science into    programming skills databases machine learning   and all are important for a ""data scientist"" in my opinion."

datascience,3226uf,TrueObservations,5,Thu Apr 9 23:51:53 2015 UTC,"Management science/operations research major here (a few years ago so I'm probably rusty).   Markov chains sound applicable here. Long story short, given a person is in a certain state (at a certain page in an app for example), what are the probabilities they do x, y, z, or whatever? Then now that they're at x, y, or z, what are the probabilities they do a, b, or c? And so on... With enough data you can create an equilibrium for your system (app). This would encompass every option and interaction within the entire app, show you how each person uses the app, define the probabilities that they perform each action, help you predict what people will do, and you can tie in expected values for each option (game purchases for example).  Each person could be considered an individual ecosystem then you could overlap the ecosystems and compare probabilities for each link on the chain to segment into the user groups you're looking for based on the way users actually use the app. Once segmented, A/B test given the probabilities of your predictions about how users will act (to see if you can get them to act in ways you want them to act). You could also forget about segmenting if the systems are too differentiated and tailor content based on each individual's profile.  Side note I should mention: Markov chains aren't supposed to care about history (if I'm at the home page it doesn't matter if I just bought something and returned home or if I returned home from settings, I'll act the same way since I'm on the home page), but you can get around that by defining different nodes/paths with built in history. There are also probably more complicated versions of Markov chains that I never learned about, but knowing about Markov chains may help you find that subject!  PM me if you wanna shoot around ideas. I love this kinda stuff. Good luck"

You also might not even need to ""solve"" your systems (that would help you figure out your most valuable customers are, but you probably already know that).  The probabilities, nodes, and expected values from each node are probably more important for prediction purposes. All that stuff could be gathered and calculated easily with no knowledge whatsoever. (That's the type of stuff that would be given to you on a problem on a test.)  I'd suggest looking them up on Wikipedia and finding some basic examples.

Check out pd.read_fwf(), that will set you right ;)  GL2U!"
datascience,31u96s,charliehack,2,Thu Apr 9 22:00:05 2015 UTC,"Pandas has its issues with fwf. Both data.table and pandas handle csv, xlsx, and sql like a dream. data.table handles fwf a lot better in my experience.  Column inference doesn't work if you have spool artifacts or other artifacts from where your data comes from. The skiplines option is nice, but it's just syntactical sugar since you'll have to assemble line numbers of bad lines anyway.  One of the biggest headaches you'll run into is with its type inference especially when combined with SQLAlchemy. If you have any columns of string data codes ""123.456"" or ""000.123"" you'll have to ""correct"" pandas with a fugly astype(str).apply(lambda x: ""{:.xf}"".format(float(x)).zfill) transform. Pandas will convert a million and one things to float (even commit float to database) when you don't want it to. It's extremely frustrating.  That's just to tell pandas that you want it to handle one column as a string. You have to babysit its type inferrer way too much. Wait until you run into IndexingError: Unalignable boolean Series key provided. That one's always a blast.   Compare to R where you just types <- rep(""character"", length(columns)) and it will happily treat all your data as a string unless you don't want it to (99% of the time I want it to).  There are lots of little differences between the two, some things pandas does better, some things R. In the end the biggest headaches are with pandas. Combined with how 1, 2, 3 easy it is to combine R with a web framework and dynamic visualizations and R wins imo. Nothing compares to ggplot2.  I did check out Talend Open Studio which I think is what I'm going to move big-picture effort toward as far as... well... ETL tasks go.

The I find the whole culture of the business world far more satisfying than academia with it's hollow promises that hard work matters more than results and if you keep your 70% below market rate salary long enough you'll eventually get one of those coveted professor spots.  If you are tempted to believe that, pick some random, mid level university, look at the faculty bios in your field and see how many got a Ph. D. in the last decade.  2) Yes, you would be doing yourself a disservice.  The postdoc won't make you more qualified for private sector work.  Would you rather be in your entry level position at 29 or 31?  Then, would you rather start managing people at 32 or 34?  Adjust those numbers up or down to match your current situation.  3) I actually think I have more freedom now than in academia.  The projects are shorter: idea, hypothesis, data collection, analysis, actionable conclusion, deploy new business strategy and see the impact takes 2 weeks.  You don't get locked in to projects for years at a time like you can in a lab.  I pick a lot of my own projects at this point, but that is earned.  Once they think your insights are valuable, they're likely to think your insights on what you should be working on are valuable too.  4) This depends a lot on the type of company you're working for.  Most startups don't really care what hours you work and many have unlimited vacation, plus freedom to remote when needed.  If you're doing DS for an airline, the experience might be different."

datascience,31oilq,Teigue,2,Thu Apr 9 12:56:59 2015 UTC,"I am defending my dissertation on Friday.  My degree is in Biomedical Engineering.  I received a job offer last November for a Data Science position at a large local company, and struck a deal with my advisor that I would write my dissertation while working, so this worked out great for me.  I love my decision, but it may be partially due to the following reasons:  1) I loved the coding and stats part of my job more than the biochemistry part (If you take a DS job, you likely will not have the same subject area, so factor that in);  2) My wife also has an equally-valued career, and works locally, so the idea of moving somewhere for 2-3 years and having to move again didn't sound particularly fun (If you are single, this is not necessarily an issue);  3) My job is in an R&D Department, so I have an unbelievable amount of freedom right now.  Sure, the projects have to be at least direct as toward some benefit to the company, but it's been a good deal.  4) I get 23 days paid vacation + 10 holidays.  Additionally, I can work from home whenever I want.  I have never envisioned such job flexibility, but it is apparently possible.  Just decide if you like the overall atmosphere/environment of academia, the grind toward Tenure, etc.  I couldn't picture myself doing that, so had decided that I wanted to go to industry quite a while ago.  I also have had over 10 publications in some pretty major journals, and I am fairly certain I wouldn't have had an issue getting a postdoc, especially because of my advisor's connections, so it isn't like I ""couldn't"" find a good postdoc.  Finally, I like to pursue a variety of non-work-related interests, as well, and I always felt during my PhD that I should be working, whereas I don't feel that way for my job (Aside from the fact that all of my freetime has been spent writing)."

If your projects don't move the needle then they have to empower someone else to move the needle, e.g. marketing analytics does not directly improve sales but by enhancing the marketing it could. If your work doesn't have at least a second order impact then you'll be shut down and put on something that does provide impact/value. In my experience this is where science and business butt heads.

The one thing I do though is make sure that people like you, who want to stay away from it, spend about 90% of their time doing actual research. It sounds to me like you are doing the work that your PM or manager or someone senior should be doing. You should talk to someone in your org about getting someone to fill that role for you if you feel your value is better off in focusing on research. Also a dedicated PM or manager will help push projects on your behalf and argue for your own research's value.  As for working on projects and then needing to switch based off business demand, that's par for the course.

If you aren't staying in academia I don't think it's too crucial where you go to grad school. So I'd say factor convenience and cost into your decision. Cast a wide net, apply to some top tier mid tier and lower tier programs, because you never know where you'll gain admission and where you'll be rejected. It's not the same as undergraduate admission. If you wanted to do a PhD, then you would typically pick programs by faculty you'd like to work with, but for MS you probably won't be doing research. As far as what you should study, I'd suggest statistics. You'll have a BS CS, that's great. Knowing more stats will give you the skills to actually do the work and it would set you up nicely for a data science role. Ok, internship or research over summer... They're both good. You're sure you don't want to be a developer when you graduate? If you're not sure then you could do the internship and have more information about what it's like to work as a dev.

My interpretation:   You have 50,000 time series, each corresponding to a person/household daily water usage. Each series holds up to two years of daily observations, meaning that the maximum number of observations per series is 730. You want to characterize each series by overall use, seasonality, and variance. After you've made these characterizations, you want to cluster them based on common profiles with respect to the characterizations.   That sound about right?  The first thing you might want to look at is ARIMA models (auto regressive integrated moving average) for characterizing overall use, trends, and seasonality.   If you think there's something to the variance -- e.g., clusters of variance that might be explainable -- you might want to consider investigating that withe the ARCH (autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) family of models.  I don't know what software you'll be using, but R has about eight time series packages that can help you, and there are four or five free online books about time series with R that you can find with some simple Google queries.

datascience,3111hq,Rbrogrammer,2,Wed Apr 1 12:58:08 2015 UTC,"As a quick and dirty analysis, why not just threshold every person's usage individually at like 80% and look at coincidences?    What I mean by this is: take each person's time series and individually compute the 80th percentile (for each person, very important).  Convert the time series to a logic array where each element is a day and has a 1 if that day was one of the high usage days.  Then you can sum them all up and give each day a score--something like 30,000 people had an 80th percentile day on July 6th, 2014 for example.    Your final output plot could be a bar graph, with day on the x-axis and number of people with high usage on y-axis.  This would perfectly capture the seasonality and spikeyness you want."

datascience,30zhzg,WallyMetropolis,3,Wed Apr 1 00:27:20 2015 UTC,You should work on figuring this out. There is a kaggle competition currently on the restaurant business that obviously has some benefit to the sponsor. Thinking about what probls you could help in if you had certain data should be an easier problem than what problems you could solve given some a certain data source. You seem to be having trouble with the easier problem of the 2 . start there

datascience,30sei8,urmyheartBeatStopR,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:40:05 2015 UTC,"Spark is all pretty hype up right now with good momentum.  I've been in a meetup with an OpenX talk and Spark couldn't help them because they had real Big Data and it couldn't fit everything in memory. The dude uses Hadoop instead. He couldn't go into details with it but they were getting 2TB a day worth of data.   What Felix talked about was that there are algorithms such as hyperloglog where you can use in Hadoop and it'll be in memory too, just like Spark. Because the hadoop data scheduler/whatever will decide whether it can fit in memory or disk.  My take away from the talk is that spark can do so much and you can probably prototype with a set of data (limited, deliberate chosen size data). But if you're getting 2TB a day and you want to do queries on years+ worth of data (265*2TB*#year) you ain't fitting that shit in memory unless you want to pay up yer butt. So  hadoop ain't going nowhere and that algorithm makes all the difference. But in general, personally for me I'mma wait to see how Spark and Flink mature before investing in anything. It doesn't hurt to learn it and I've seen companies that are using Spark because datastax, cassandra company, is bundling it with Spark now too. Not only cause of datastax, it's just a small drop in the bucket, but there are other companies that are looking into Spark and currently testing it out.  Worst case, that I can see, even if Spark is shit, it'll be like MongoDB or Oracle, so many companies would be stuck on it with the current momentum really that it'll be too costly to migrate out of it.  Note and fair warning I'm just a newbie that's trying to get into this field."

Graduate school is absolutely necessary. It's possible to get a job with just a masters (provided you have busted your ass, done a lot of learning outside of your program, and have the right combination of skills), but you'll find the majority of jobs require a PhD in a related and math heavy field (stats, physics, comp sci, etc). And based on my experiences, this is definitely a field where brand/school recognition matters. A lot. This may not be what you wanted to hear, but if you haven't even started undergrad yet (not sure how you transfer without having enrolled yet, but whatever).   tl;dr - Yes. A lot. A bunch of MOOC's and an undergrad degree won't cut it.   EDIT: Several straight out of undergrad data scientists have chimed in to disprove my point. I didn't make it clear in my original response, but part of my reasoning behind saying that a graduate degree is absolutely necessary is how far along the OP is in his/her education. Given how hot/buzz-wordy data science is, combined with the strong earning potential, I struggle to envision a future where the field doesn't continue to be flooded with data scientist hopefulls. While getting a very good data science job directly out of undergrad is certainly possible right now (or has been over the last couple of years before the ""boom""), I think it's very important to consider where the job market will be 4+ years in the future. The glut of applicants WILL have effects on the market. A few options: A) increased competition will result in only the most highly qualified/educated (education's relevance on being qualified is another conversation entirely) getting job offers. B) companies looking to cut overhead will hire less ""qualified"" individuals (again with the qualified/educated debate) who will undercut the grad school trained data scientists driving salaries lower industry wide (less likely I think, but merely speculation on my part) C) the majority of data science becomes automated and farmed out to your everyday BA, and a much smaller core group of data scientists is retained just to ensure that shit doesn't completely blow up.

datascience,30lgwu,DrLionelRaymond,5,Sun Mar 29 01:04:31 2015 UTC,"IMO, it depends on where you are and what you want to do. If you're somewhere like the Bay Area, you may find a start-up willing to go with someone without a graduate degree and possibly a bachelors + boot camp. If you're in NYC and have your heart set working in some sort of quant field for an investment firm, then you probably do not stand much chance without at least a Master's-level degree.  And since you stated that you're not enrolled in undergrad yet, I do want to clarify a point that sometimes younger people seem to misinterpret.. When a company ""sends someone to school"", that just means they are paying for your tuition, and usually just a portion of it and not the entire cost. That's it. It's not easier to get into a school because of the company (you still apply / interview / etc.. like everyone else) and you work full-time, as usual, then take classes at night and on the weekends. It's not (as sometimes people envision) you picking a school, and them just giving you $50,000-$100,000 and saying ""see you in a couple years when you finish!""   A number of companies offer tuition reimbursement (if you get lucky, like I did, some will pay 100% of tuition and books, with no yearly limit) though it's certainly not a common benefit. There are almost always obligations attached to that as well. For example, I'm under contract with my company for 4 years after the date I finish the degree. I can't go anywhere else (or if I do, I owe them money).  As far as GPA.. that's an unusual question (perhaps I misinterpreted it).. IMO, you should want to achieve the highest GPA possible regardless of if you go to grad school or not. That's one thing many companies will look at when hiring a new graduate without much work experience, or when considering them for internships.  There are exceptions to every rule, but in general, I don't think you'll find too many people in actual data science roles without at least a Master's degree in some quantitative field.   Just to give you an idea, many roles that would fall under the 'data science' umbrella have started popping up at my company, and for most of them a PhD is 'desired', while a Master's-level degree is a prerequisite to even get past HR and be considered for the position."
datascience,30lgwu,nameBrandon,4,Sun Mar 29 10:32:17 2015 UTC,"Among the dozens of data scientists in my department, almost everyone has some kind of advanced degree, probably split about 50/50 between MS and PhD. There are a couple of people with just a BS, but it's very uncommon to find someone without an advanced degree who has the skills we need.   For your undergrad planning, stats major + cs minor is a good choice. Getting a high GPA is good, but looking for data science or data analyst internships in your junior/senior year is what will really help your career."

Think of it more like Visual Basic (Tableau) would be to like C++ (matplotlib).  Tableau is mostly drag and drop, and can be used similarly to matplotlib (standard plotting, etc..).. I would say Tableau is much more focused on interpreting and sharing the data with others, where matplotlib is more focused on evaluating data for further analysis. You can use both for either, but if I wanted to look at a dataset visually and try and derive relationships, etc.. I'd probably use matplotlib. If I wanted to take that data and create a useful graphic for publication or a presentation, I'd probably go with Tableau.  I don't mean to come off as an expert in either, I'm certainly not (I mainly live in ggplot2), but to give a visual example.. I started with Tableau not too long ago, and this was the first visualization I did with it, and it took about 5 minutes (literally, 5 minutes).  https://public.tableau.com/views/Uptown2015Graffitti/Sheet1?:embed=y&:showTabs=y&:display_count=yes  I think that should probably make clear how matplotlib/ggplot2 and Tableau are focused differently."

A week in the life of.... Students take two classes a semester and each meet once a week for 90 minutes. Before showing up to the live session you need to complete the async material which is a combination of outside videos, pre-recorded lectures (high quality, recorded in a studio) and readings (academic papers and others). These usually take 6-10 hours per week per class. In addition some classes have weekly or monthly assignments. These assignments vary a lot from class to class. Some take 30 min, some take several hours.  It's definitely a lot of work (especially in addition to a full time job). Professors are usually pretty good about extending deadlines though. You have to decide between sacrificing most of your weekend or most of your weeknights to the program.   The live class experience varies from professor to professor. Everyone is required to have their webcam turned on.  Usually there is a group discussion of the topics of the week, followed by some small group work discussions/lab.  How is the level of instruction? Overall it has been good. A good mix of instructors from academia (UC Berkeley iSchool profs) and industry (Google, LinkedIn?, Trulia, IBM, ...). There are still creating new classes and tweaking existing ones to improve - they definitely have changed things based on our feedback. I'd say that the current suite of offerings is looking pretty good and continues to improve.  Job placements No one has graduated yet, but several people have already gotten job offers in the data science field. I imagine they will heavily publicize job placement results when they become available.   Admissions/Pre-reqs The program requires a basic knowledge of statistics, math and programming. They do a good job of reviewing some of the lower level stuff and offer smaller 'bridge' classes to catch people up who don't have programming experience. Python and R seem to be the languages of choice atm.  Schedule Rigidity The first semester you have to take the same two classes but after that it's pretty wide open. To begin with we were limited by the number of elective classes that had actually been created, but it seems to be opening up more now.   Overall If I had to do it again I would have waited to apply until about now. The not-so-stellar classes have been redone and fixed and there is a good and growing number of electives. I'm getting my employer to pay for a chunk of it as are most other people.

datascience,30gbda,sleepicat,1 point,Fri Mar 27 04:17:40 2015 UTC,"Curve fitting:       Curve fitting   is the process of constructing a curve, or mathematical function, that has the best fit to a series of data points,  possibly subject to constraints.   Curve fitting can involve either interpolation,   where an exact fit to the data is required, or smoothing,   in which a ""smooth"" function is constructed that approximately fits the data. A related topic is regression analysis,   which focuses more on questions of statistical inference such as how much uncertainty is present in a curve that is fit to data observed with random errors. Fitted curves can be used as an aid for data visualization,   to infer values of a function where no data are available,  and to summarize the relationships among two or more variables.  Extrapolation refers to the use of a fitted curve beyond the range of the observed data,  and is subject to a degree of uncertainty  since it may reflect the method used to construct the curve as much as it reflects the observed data.

Take the Bubble chart example:   Q2 is about 50% larger than Q1 The data clearly show that scaling by radius leads to a larger perceived difference than scaling by area.   Area scaling ==> 1.7 on 'Likert' scale Radius scaling ==> 2.7 on 'Likert' scale    But which of these is right? Maybe a 2.7 is exactly what you want for a 50% difference. In reality, this sort of Likert rating is probably different for different people. (You and I might both agree there's a fifty percent difference, but you might assign that a 1 and I assign it a 2.5.)  I'm not saying that I think radius-scaling is the right way to go, just that there's nothing in this paper that supports one or the other. So I think it's a little misleading to label one as 'Control' and one as 'Deceptive'."

datascience,303b83,dustrider,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:45:20 2015 UTC,"you're right, but the Jupyter approach to multi-user is that you each have your own notebooks... somewhat missing the point. It's really nice in one way as it allows for separate execution environments per user, which is nifty.  FWIW, I've since set up a server with beaker, it's much easier to get rolling than Jupyter thanks to a dockerfile.  I've got a small gripe with it though, it's hardcoded to run on port 8800 over https using a self-signed cert... just frickin annoying.   so not only could you struggle to get at the port (corporate firewall monkeys for the win!)  but you've also got to ensure to tell your browser to use https and then you've got to explain to your users that ""No the scary 'this site is not secure' message doesn't mean ISIS are going to run off with your datascience, and yes just click the proceed button that chrome has helpfully hidden under more scary text"".  What's so terrible about running on 443 like a normal ssl service!?!   Submitting a change request as soon as my ears stop ringing from banging my head against the desk.  Oh yeah and the password's randomly generated in the docker startup output, and can't be changed!  Rant aside, comparing Jupyter to Beaker: Beaker seems slicker in terms of finish and you can be up and running in minutes, Jupyters got more fidelity and certainly the go to option if you've got multiple people doing separate work. That said if you need more than one person to work on your notebook both can work for you and neither will tell you which person did what, so for me there's still a lot of itches that need scratching.   For now I'll continue on Beaker however still need to configure it to push jobs to a Spark cluster so may still run into blocking issues.   And of course I'm by no means an expert in setting up either, so if anyone can point out where I've missed the glaringly obvious setup that answers all my questions I'll be very grateful."

I'll be the first to admit that it isn't perfect. I run it on a Mac and I have to use the beta version (I think it's 1.2. Link can't be found on their FAQ page). It also isn't a full replacement for ipython/Spyder/rstudio etc. But I've found it really useful for on the fly exploratory analysis. Be it my own personal biases/comfort level with certain types of analysis in one language over another, one language actually being better that the other for a certain task, or just an imbalance in my skillset, I am constantly jumping back and for between R and Python and the switch doesn't always feel smooth. I also tend to get pulled into meetings and asked to showcase our data knowledge to clients or to add the stats/programming know-how to a brainstorming session with product developers, etc. The flexibility to jump to JavaScript or Ruby and back to R or Python on the fly while just piping data between cells is nothing short of awesome. I'm also very curious about Julia so having that in their allows me to tinker when I get bored. Not a necessity but I enjoy it. I still wouldn't rely on Beaker for doing anything hardcore. I have no reason to believe it isn't up to the task, I just prefer to stick to one language once I've identified an analytic plan and thus prefer to use a more specialized tool (PyCharm/Spyder or RStudio)."

datascience,301kw4,ragnarocka,3,Tue Mar 24 13:39:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with IPython, especially the IPython Notebook.  In fact, you can use R in an IPython Notebook.  RStudio is great but the ability to reproduce an IPython session makes it really valuable.  But, outside of prototyping small bits it starts to break down.  And that's nothing against it, the goal was a way to iterate quickly with fresh ideas.  So for an IDE, if you're on Windows, I would take a look at the Python Tools for Visual Studio.  Now that Visual Studio Community Edition is free, you don't really have an excuse. ;)  It has support for IPython integrated plus a lot more.  On the Mac you'll probably want to stick with PyCharm.  But the VS tools are open source (one of the most popular MS open source projects) and are being tooled to work with Azure and Azure Machine Learning Studio which has a free quota so worth looking into."

I was a ""business analyst"" for a while and it was nothing as glamorous as the article states by putting it side by side ds and ce. Also, with all the annoying cool titles companies come up with (""data wizard"", ""data ninja""), these roles are completely confounded. You have to really ask and dig during an interview to know what your role will be."

The 'business analyst' title is intentionally broad and I know some BA's that work for my company doing data analysis, others that gather requirements and still others that fill niche roles specific to our environment. All of them have varying levels of technical knowledge and expertise.  I think that the article did made some decent points about the 'data engineer' title though."
datascience,30050h,icedevil6,5,Mon Mar 23 16:11:39 2015 UTC,"I have worked in several startups in some kind of data* capacity, and I have noticed that there are big differentiators in these roles as well. BUT, instead of trying to separate these groups by skill sets, I think it makes more sense to separate them by their customers who consume the analysis. To co-opt the above terms, I would say these separate into:  Business Analyst: Employees who deliver analysis for consumption by their employer. This is used to direct the strategy of their company. Their customers might be sales, marketing, product, etc within the company they work for. They need to deliver analysis, not code, which is why they traditionally don't need/come from computer science backgrounds. That isn't to say they wouldn't benefit from CS skills. Nor does it mean having hacking skills necessarily makes them data scientists.  Data Scientist: People who deliver analysis for consumption by the customer of the business. In other words, their analysis gets directly built into the product the company is delivering. Since this built into product, you need the CS/hacking skills to put it into code that can be automatically computed on the fly.  Data Engineer: People who make data computable by either business analysts or data scientists. They build the infrastructure to integrate data sources, develop meaningful schemas, and process the data. Without them, you can't go much farther than data that fits in memory kludged together with python/R/matlab. Also, these happen to be some of the more difficult employees to find. It isn't made to seem as sexy as the other jobs, though most startups desperately need an engineer waaaay before they need data scientists/analysts.   Why do I feel it is better do differentiate this way? Because it seems that everybody I talk to, interview, or hire wants the second role (data scientist). Few people want to create powerpoint presentations with internal company data to present to marketing. Even if you call that a data scientist role, I doubt many graduating PhD students would clamor for that position as opposed to (for example) building a recommender system that gets directly implemented on a mobile app.  I like separating these definitions so nobody interviews/applies for work they don't want, and also so we can celebrate all three roles rather than keep parroting that ""data science is the sexiest job."" All that does is make people shoe-horn their skill-set into data sciencem which only makes the term even more ambiguous.  Finally, unless you are a large company that can explicitly make groups that fit these roles, they will always bleed into each other. I think it's valuable to know these differences so employees can position themselves for a career down the line, and businesses can think strategically about what skillsets to hire for."
datascience,30050h,fjeg,2,Mon Mar 23 16:55:48 2015 UTC,A lot of data scientist work on data for product managers/game designers/user acquisition especially in companies that are a bit bigger. Your definition would take away their data science title just because they feed into a product via a product manager instead of directly via an api? I'm sorry that definition only works for small startups imho.
datascience,30050h,fjeg,2,Mon Mar 23 18:16:38 2015 UTC,"Sure, I totally admit my commentary might be skewed towards startups :) That being said, any attempt to provide strict definitions of these terms is going to rule people in/out of those titles, so I am less concerned about letting people keep their titles than I am about providing clarity to an ambiguous term."

People come into data science jobs looking to do ""cool"" jobs such as recommender systems, classifiers, deep learning, etc. The issue is that data science roles are typically much more along the lines of what you just mentioned. The thing is, these two jobs are very different. It's like comparing front-end to back-end web developers because they both work on websites. As it stands, it looks like the term ""data scientist"" will end up similar to the term ""programmer."" Both are a very general set of methods with many sub-specialties.   As an aside, while we are literally arguing semantics, I think the fact that there are so many people trying to define this field shows that these discussions are more about the future of data science rather than categorizing for fun."

What I hear and experience constantly is that practical work in data science/analytics means being part of a team, and primarily serving a role as analyst, coder, or domain knowledge expert; this seems to be the main gist of his article.  But also (again, experience speaking here, YMMV) each member of the team needs to have some background/training in all three areas.  If my domain knowledge expert knows zero statistics, we're hosed, because she won't be able to meaningfully answer questions (fortunately, she knows a fair bit of statistics).  If I knew nothing about coding, I might be asking my coder for six impossible things before lunch.  Even if everyone on the team has good foundations in all three areas, it still takes some time to learn to work together effectively; I can only imagine how much worse that is going to be if the team members are highly specialized and share little common background."
datascience,30050h,NoMoreIdols,2,Mon Mar 23 12:55:45 2015 UTC,"I agreed with what you are saying, the author of the article does point out that a data scientist need to have all three skills to some degree (see graphic in the article).

Source: I know and work with a number of people that have gone through the NCSU program (I have even worked with several of them before AND after they entered/finished). I also interview  applicants for data analytics/science positions at the company I currently work for.   The NCSU MSA program is almost entirely SAS based (they are large sponsors - makes sense since SAS was founded/developed by three NCSU grads). That's not necessarily a bad thing as SAS has hired several graduates of the program into data scientist roles upon graduation, and the use of SAS is still relatively predominant in RTP given the large biotech presence (the FDA loves SAS!) and SAS being headquartered in Cary. Python, R, and Hadoop are ""introduced"", but are very, very secondary to the teaching/use of SAS. Earning a SAS certification isn't required, but definitely expected. Every student for the past several years (and 85+ % of students in the years prior) earned a SAS base cert at minimum. A quote from an NCSU MSA press release    ""To date, over ninety percent of the MSA Class of 2014 have completed at least three certifications: SAS Certified Base Programmer for SAS 9, SAS Certified Predictive Modeler Using SAS Enterprise Miner 7, and SAS Certified Statistical Business Analyst Using SAS 9: Regression and Modeling. Additionally, one-third of the student cohort has earned SAS Certified Advanced Programmer for SAS 9.""   The program is only 10 months, so in order to gain that level of SAS experience in such a short period of time basically requires that you use it almost exclusively (and the program does). There just isn't a whole lot of time or room in the curriculum to include R, Python, Hadoop, NoSQL, etc in any meaningful way.   What is your background? Are you coming straight out of undergrad or do you have a moderate amount of professional data analytics experience? Based on my dealings with numerous graduates of the program, I've noticed that those who have very little professional experience and those who are switching career paths reported having higher levels of satisfaction with the program and felt that they got more out of it or that the program was ""worth it"", but those who had other graduate degrees or greater amounts of professional experience (3-5 years +) were must less enthusiastic about the program and felt they gained very little from the program (relative to those without math heavy graduate degrees or significant work histories).   Lastly, a look at the NCSU practicum sponsor list is a bit interesting (though based on my knowledge I'm not sure if it's entirely accurate). The small number of repeat sponsors and the large list of former sponsors gives me pause. I feel like it says something, but not really sure what it is saying. Not bashing the NCSU program in any way. There's no denying that it is a very good and successful program. Just trying to give as objective a response as possible and provide you with some food for thought."

My main goals for a masters program is to expand my toolset and gain the recruiting advantages of a dedicated program. However, I'm not entirely sure how being a SAS expert could limit my career prospects down the road. I have little to no professional data analytics experience."

Definitely plenty of work for SAS experts, but it can be very location and industry dependent. I don't see SAS going away anytime soon, but they have seen significant drops in annual revenue as more and more organizations question the value of $$$$ licenses given the prevalence and support of cheaper alternatives. R support is being baked into almost all of the major big data and analytics systems and Python is just as, if not more widely supported due to it being a scripting language that can also do data analysis. You would be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't do a thorough review of your career goals and an evaluation of what skills would make you most competitive given current industry trends.

A lot of the employers who come to recruit say they are there because they were so impressed with the work their practicum team did 1, 2, 3, etc. years ago, so a variety of sponsors makes it easier to show more employers what the students are capable of.  Also, a few former practicum sponsors have been barred from future sponsorship due to things like taking too long to get data to their team or not providing a reliable point of contact."

The program is pretty much entirely SAS based - any other programming languages you will need to learn on your own.  It is heavy in statistics, not much or really any exposure to the CS/Machine learning side of data science. There is also a lot of emphasis on soft skills/consulting, with the program being almost entirely teamwork based.  The faculty at NC state is top notch and career placement really can't be beat. A major goal of the program is to have every student placed in a good paying job, and the salary reports show that they are successful in that regard.  Just FYI... the salary statistics are somewhat skewed by the consulting companies. Deloitte is a major recruiter and the huge base salaries/signing bonuses there bring the numbers up a lot. SAS, unsurprisingly, is also on of the biggest employers of graduates.   I don't know anything about the UT Austin program. I wouldn't base your decision on being limited career wise because NC State teaches SAS. You can learn Python/R/etc from google as you need them. You don't need formal masters education to learn different programming languages.  Shoot me a PM if you have any questions"
datascience,30166p,LucidChess,2,Wed Mar 25 03:33:29 2015 UTC,"DISCLAIMER: I am currently finishing up the MS in Analytics from NCSU and am biased.  I don't know a lot about UT-Austin's program so I'll mainly speak to NCSU's strengths and try to address some of the criticisms in this thread.  One of the big things NCSU has going for it is that it's the longest running program of its kind. Nearly ten years of relationships with employers and alumni out in the workforce has helped it build a strong brand among employers. Last year's class graduated with 100% full time employment and we're closing in on that number with a little more than a month until graduation.  Will you receive more SAS instruction than R & Python? Yes, this has been a complaint by former students every year and it's one that NCSU takes steps to improve every year. That's a benefit of being an older, more established program that has had time to implement student/employer suggestions while working its way through growing pains.  Over the summer you will have six full days (9-5) of SAS instruction that covers all of the material for the Base SAS certification exam. Over the fall you receive most of your R instruction, which basically covers how to do everything in R that you know how to do in SAS that point. There is some Python as well, but I'd say those who are comfortable with Python made an effort outside of class to learn it (including a student run Python Working Group). You spend most of the rest of your time in the program focusing on the different modeling techniques (with the exception being the big data course on Hadoop/Hive/Pig) with the tool a professor uses in class depending on the one he/she prefers. In our time series and survival analysis courses for example, we saw how to do each in-class example in SAS and R. For homework assignments, it's up to you what tool you want to use.  The practicum project also plays a big part in which tool people prefer because if your sponsor doesn't have SAS then it doesn't make sense to use SAS. Some of the students in our program haven't touched SAS since August because they're doing their practicums entirely in R.  As for your decision, is there a particular industry or company that interests you? Very few of NCSU's students end up in start-ups, since the majority of the employers that come to campus to recruit are in industries like banking/finance, healthcare, business consulting, consumer packaged goods, government/gov consulting, and insurance. That's probably because a lot of these industries rely exclusively on SAS. People from our program have interviewed with West Coast tech companies like Google and Apple but these are usually people who come into the program with a computer science background.  Another thing you might want to consider is geographic preference. This year's grads will be going to big cities like San Francisco, Boston, New York, Chicago, DC, and a lot are staying in NC. Some are going to the midwest but if you would prefer to live/work in Texas then you will probably have better luck making that happen from UT-Austin."

This means that you should know exactly what the difference between mean/median/P(random variable > some value) are, and when you should be looking at one and not the other (or just the entire distribution)  You should be very comfortable with things like Simpson's paradox and always be willing to dig deeper into data/slice statistics across various dimensions rather than take things at face value.  It's also very important to have a good eye for sampling bias/places where some assumptions you might have, like independence, will be violated.    2) If you work with experimentation or A/B testing, you should have a very good grasp of hypothesis testing, as well as some other related topics like the bootstrap.    3) You should understand basic regression modelling very well.    4) You should understand causal inference very well, if not at a super-formal level, at an intuitive level.    5) You should understand Bayesian statistics well, and 'think like a Bayesian', even if a lot of the techniques you use are essentially frequentist.    6) Depending on your job, you should know some machine learning techniques.  You should also understand things like the bias-variance tradeoff, overfitting, etc.  For your particular data science job, you may need to know a lot more than this, but every data scientist should know a little."

If Wasserman is your first stats and you did not have a serious intro stats course, you may want to pick up a copy of Moore & McCabe's text (get a 4th or 5th edition on the cheap).  (b) Be willing to do some background reading when you go into Bishop's book."
datascience,2zvsz3,sniperdogruffo,3,Sun Mar 22 06:24:13 2015 UTC,"I can't recall the name of the transformation, but there's one where you take something like what you have and concert it into a number of boolean features.  But I don't know if that's useful as an input into PCA.  The risk I see of you're encoding is that ""Never"" is ""Frequently"" + 2, which is not a meaningful relationship that you've introduced.  But that might not matter.  These are ""categorical"" variables.  Check this: http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/5774/can-principal-component-analysis-be-applied-to-datasets-containing-a-mix-of-cont  Edit: The scikit-learn docs call one way to handle this:  one-of-K or one-hot encoding.  One possibility to convert categorical features to features that can be used with scikit-learn estimators is to use a one-of-K or one-hot encoding, which is implemented in OneHotEncoder. This estimator transforms each categorical feature with m possible values into m binary features, with only one active.  http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#encoding-categorical-features"

datascience,2zvsz3,grandzooby,-1,Sun Mar 22 11:17:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think so.  Suppose you have a categorical feature that has 4 colors, red, blue, yellow, white.  You could assign those to the numbers 1,2,3,4 but that adds meaning that's not actually present in the data (i.e. yellow is twice as far from red as blue is).  Instead, you create 4 new binary features, IsRed, IsBlue, IsYellow, IsWhite.  The overall degrees of freedom haven't changed but you might have made the data more suitable for a particular analysis.  I suppose these could be dummy variables, but I've only seen that term in doing regressions and forecasting."

datascience,2zvsz3,kebabmybob,1 point,Sun Mar 22 12:58:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I'd only ever seen these called dummy variables when used in regressions and forecasting where they end up functioning as coefficients that essentially turn rows of data off (e.g. IsSalesPromo, NotSalesPromo), rather than being the transformation of a categorical variable into discrete binary variables."
datascience,2zvsz3,grandzooby,1 point,Sun Mar 22 23:10:27 2015 UTC,"Just a tip: typically when you code 4 binary features (with dummy coding), you need one less dummy variable, otherwise you would be over-specifying the system.

They all have different assumptions.  Do not arbitrarily assign numerical values 1,2,3 -- this will weigh some options more heavily than others. PCA is not scale-independent, and this will introduce distortions."

DS is far more than programming and I don't see CS as being a slam-dunk choice. Why not stats with a dash of CS, or Computer Engineering (which will give you a dash of CS and stats built-in)? Always opt for taking the coursework that is difficult to learn on your own (otherwise, why waste your time in school learning something you can learn on your own?) 2) Go for the cheaper school, caeteris paribus. A load of debt will be an anchor around your neck for a long time. It will affect how you chose a job and limit your ability to take risks. Seriously, do the math and figure out what your monthly payment will be after you graduate then compare that with your other expenses.  3) After going to the cheaper school get a graduate degree in a program that will pay you - In most engineering programs you can do a funded thesis.  4) Do real work in real companies or do real projects with other humans."

datascience,2zl3hm,DisagreeableDad,2,Thu Mar 19 15:52:50 2015 UTC,It depends on what he's done with the Microsoft stack;  There's plenty of statistical analysis and extrapolation that can be done with Analysis Services and/or data mining (for example).  Personally I would start looking at data science coursework or opportunities to utilize the tools in-house to gain experience.  I think BI is evolving into data science (or data science is a higher-end utilization of BI).
datascience,2zluq2,datakittenMEOW,3,Thu Mar 19 17:43:31 2015 UTC,"Hi, there!  I'm not a dyed-in-the-wool data scientist (natural science researcher in academia, here), but with regards to learning R, Python or SPSS on your own, it's absolutely possible do go about learning the basics independently (though perhaps with much teeth gnashing, if you're like me!).  R is my main tool, so I know those resources the best:  This is a quick, few-hour thingy that will get you set up with ""how do I actually do stuff in R"": https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r  If you end up liking it and want to dig in deeper, there is an excellent series of Coursera courses (free) on data analysis that is taught in the R environment, and the first course is an introduction to R: https://www.coursera.org/course/rprog  Just throwing two stand-alone R resources out there.  Folks who are in the private sector will probably have a better handle on what program it's most useful to be familiar with.  My understanding is that SPSS and Stata are the social science go-to programs and R and Python are the natural science/engineering go-tos, with engineering also having a lot of Matlab work floating around.  Just my two cents!  Good luck and have fun getting started!"

Data analytics doesn't really mean much.  The Berkeley program markets their program a lot. I don't know what the degree will mean in 10 years, but I get the sense that it is a profit center for them. It's an online program too.  Cornell is Ivy League and a degree in Operations Research, which is a well-defined field. Upstate New York isn't for everyone.  Carnegie Mellon probably has the best Computer Science program in the country, but the Master of Information Systems Management sounds like a business MIS degree to me. Is it a Master of Science and is it affiliated with their School of Computer Science? I don't care for Pittsburgh but it's become a good place in the past decade.  Northwestern is good. It's an MS, on-campus, and Chicago is great."

I'm kinda forced to interpret that as pure marketing, and it makes me even more uncomfortable about the program.  I mean, it is UC Berkeley, so I doubt it's a terrible program, but I seriously doubt it's the best bang-for-your-buck program out there."

datascience,2zi8cy,deeayecee,2,Thu Mar 19 12:19:27 2015 UTC,"I got the same vibe from folks in the NU program that others here got from the Berkley program.  My feeling is that analytics are really easy for somebody if they get really, really deep on something in hard computational science, like optimization. Operation Research/Optimization is a very, very solid bedrock framework for somebody to learn and my feeling is you'll be able to get a very good job if you emerge from that program.  On top of that, I feel like whenever these types of threads emerge, folks emphasize developing as strong of programming or software engineering chops as possible. My impression is you'll push your limits on that front more so in the Cornell program than any of the others."
datascience,2zi8cy,ml_ds,1 point,Thu Mar 19 12:45:13 2015 UTC,"Felt like I should comment on this, but Northwestern's on-campus MSiA is most definitely not one of the programs created to capitalize on the popularity of data science. It's a very technical program, arguably the most computationally intensive of all of these new Analytics/Business Analytics etc. degrees that have been popping up lately. Their acceptance rate this year was under 5%, if they were just trying to make money off the program the admit rate wouldn't be so low. My advice would be to look at the specific curricula of each of these programs and decide which aligns best with your career goals for afterwards, as each of these schools are on roughly the same tier. Either way, congratulations! Having to make a decision between these schools is a good problem to have."

This is unquestionably true IMO.  I do think we must be clear about what 'decentralization' looks like.  Software vendors want to sell us on the idea that it looks like putting BI slice and dice/predictive modeling tools in the hands everyone in the organization (definitely a bad idea in the latter case).  Proper decentralization is where data scientists are solving data problems that are informed by the organization.  I.E.

However I do personally rank MOOC's as the best thing in my education, it's for me the best way to learn and to learn things that I argue are more in the realm of what I actually want to work with compared to the curriculum set by my college. The fact that in some MOOC's I end up with projects I'm able to show case for someone just adds to this value from doing the MOOC..  Obviously I'm biased about MOOCs, but for me personally MOOC's are THE corner stone in furthering my agenda to get into the field of Data Science.

If your company can't find a physics phd who knows python and R, it's because your company isn't looking for one. If someone can get a phd and is still not able to figure out what you want from them, I'm going to say it's your fault. We grad students are exposed to research in the field, which is published mostly by other grad students or professors finding practical applications of their craft. When I first started looking, I didn't anticipate that the research I was so familiar with is decades ahead of what's actually being implemented. I didn't expect the actual industry to be so far behind that. Perhaps the problem is that graduate students are never exposed to how this or that company works or what they're looking for and companies aren't about to give away secrets like that. Yet, companies still expect candidates to know their workings intimately. I recently met with one company's HR who went on and on about these people and that structure of their organization only to find surprise when I did not follow. To fill me in, they printed off an organizational chart which had in large, bold, red, upper case lettering ""FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY"". I sincerely hope they weren't genuine in expecting me to already know any of that stuff.   I've had my resume critiqued by more than a few of professionals from both the industries I'm looking at and also the people at university that get paid to do it. I've built a website with a blog to explain what I do in understandable terms with code examples I've written (and yes, my website and linkedin accounts link to each other). I've attended gatherings by professional organizations like the IEEE and ACM. I've even made business cards. Despite broadcasting myself in every conceivable way, I've applied to upwards of 50 positions and have only had two interviews. To make sure I wasn't giving some misinformation, I've had professors fact check my blog.

ML can be considered an area in AI, so if the class focuses a lot on the ML topics, it might be less useful to you.  Is the database class a theory class, where you learn how to build a database?  Or is it a survey of the major types of DBs and how to choose the right type and use it?  Also consider which would be harder to get when you're out of school.    I work a lot with databases at work and it's practical knowledge to know how to build in them and use them.

I'd imagine the same would apply to mathematics and statistics as well. I know you said leaving the program is off the table but it does sound to me that you are looking more for a non-business MS in data science or comp sci or similar. Consider this -- the switching costs are lower now than they will ever be for the rest of your life but keep in mind that some of these programs will have undergraduate prereqs that you will need to complete if you don't have a STEM undergraduate degree.

Perhaps the focus of the program (especially since it's in the B-school) is to make you a manager, not a data scientist.  My boss falls into this category.

Right now I'm looking for a job for after graduation (August 2015), and I feel like I'm in a bubble--I don't have much interaction with anyone from the data science community other than the people I see at work, so I don't have a good handle on how ""legit"" I am or how prepared I am for a job after I graduate.

If you could fit in some real math, statistics, and programming classes in your second year, you'll be in better shape (e.g., a data mining course in the statistics department).

As for languages, R, Python, and Excel are sufficient for the vast majority of data analysis/statistics, but some places also want you to pick up SAS and SPSS. Oh, and of course you need to be proficient at SQL. You should probably learn MapReduce before you graduate, too. But for now, I wouldn't worry about it given what you've said.

datascience,2ypiuu,WallyMetropolis,5,Wed Mar 11 19:12:51 2015 UTC,"It's not so important that you learn a lot of different languages. It's more important that you get to be good enough in the ones you know.   Python, R, and SQL will be plenty for the most part. Specifically, you should learn Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-learn, and probably Pandas and PyMC packages in Python. Also, something like sqlalchemy is good to have in the toolkit. You'll want to be comfortable writing etl scripts, be able to prototype out models quickly, and make sure you can reproduce anything at any later time. So that means learn version control! What version of your scripts, and exactly what data did you use 4 weeks ago to get exactly this set of results?   You'll want to be really good at producing easy-to-digest graphs and visualizations. If you want to use matplotlib for that or R's Grammar of Graphic approach, it doesn't matter so much. But a large part of the job is communicating why your results should be used to make a business decision. And you'll need to communicate that to a non-mathematical audience; sometimes a completely non-technical audience.   What will really help you do this is to have a solid understanding of the business domain in which you want to work. Knowing something about retail, marketing, finance, insurance, health, or whatever field it is will be crucial. How else can you expect to do interesting experiments?  Finally, it's probably true that if you call yourself a Data Scientist, people will associate that with 'Big Data.' That means at least understanding how to be a consumer of NoSQL databases (Cassandra, e.g.) and understanding something about the MapReduce model. To this end, if you want to add a functional language to your resume, I'd suggest Scala. Spark looks like it's going to be the MapReduce killer and while you can interact with it in Java or Python, it's natively written in Scala. And it's just so much nicer to work with Spark than Pig or raw MapReduce."
datascience,2ypiuu,datakittenMEOW,3,Wed Mar 11 20:56:37 2015 UTC,"I want to second this. Nobody expects you go to proficient in R, Python, Java, C, C++, and Matlab (the languages you listed as knowing, or wanting to learn more about).   You should know one data-specific language well, either R or Python. It would be good to have experience with the other, but you only need to know one well. If an employer uses the one you aren't strong in, they'll know you can pick up the more advanced stuff b/c you know the other language.  You know SQL, which is great. Like others have mentioned, spend some time getting familiar with NoSQL databases. Udacity has some classes on NoSQL. You don't need to be an expert on NoSQL, a lot of it isn't super hard to pick up on the job.  Having experience with a language like Java, C, or C++ is a bonus for most positions. If you are gravitating more towards an analyst role (""Data Scientist"") you may rarely if ever write true production code, and therefore never need to know one of these languages. If you wanted to be in a data engineering position (""Data Engineer"" or ""Data Scientist Engineer"") knowing one of these languages would be more beneficial. I think knowing one is more than enough. If you know Java well, and an employer uses C++ for production, they know that by knowing Java you'll be able to pick up C++.  In short, I think you've already got a lot of the skills you need :)"

datascience,2yr3b3,mrDNA_1988,3,Thu Mar 12 02:33:22 2015 UTC,"There have been many long-standing applications of statistical techniques in manufacturing but they go by the name of industrial statistics. Also, these techniques require more specialized knowledge that the typical data scientist is typically versed in.  Examples:   The equipment failure prediction model is only one of a large suite of applications in the area of Reliability Engineering. Reliability engineering concerns itself with predicting not only failure, but also equipment life-time, up-time, and so forth. Staples include Weibull and Log-normal models, but there is more to it than just these. Applications include optimal scheduling of inspection/replacement intervals, budgeting etc. In pharma manufacturing, chemometrics is huge. This encompasses various data-based techniques for drug discovery, batch manufacturing, etc. PCA/PLS type models are commonly found here. There are also a multitude of techniques under the name of QSAR. Design of Experiments is also a staple. (the banner under which all of these are known is PAT - Process Analytical Technology) In widget making industries, there is statistical process control (SPC) for controlling quality. There is a huge amount of literature surrounding the use of data and statistical techniques to improve processes -- typically under the banner of Six-Sigma.  In the process industries, plant control are based on transfer function or state space models, all of which are data-based models. This goes under the name of ""System Identification"". These involve fitting time-series models like ARX, ARIMA, ARMAX, and so on.  There are also huge areas within Operations Research for manufacturing that are very data intensive, particularly data-driven logistics.    There may be opportunities for applying new modeling techniques. But finding these cases may require a bit of work because statistics has been used for a long time in manufacturing industries, and there is already a huge corpus of existing knowledge -- manufacturing has discovered data science long before the term ever existed."
datascience,2yr3b3,cdninbuffalo,3,Thu Mar 12 07:23:43 2015 UTC,"I work as a data analyst with industrial engineering degree at a major automobile manufacturer in the U.S..  I work with warranty data and track quality with simple metrics such as number of claims divided by number of vehicles sold (defect rate) to normalize when comparing one vehicle population with another. I look at defect rates by production months and also by months since a vehicle was released to the market.  I also look at geographical  trends because certain parts tend to fail quicker in hot or cold temps so I make choropleth maps a lot using defect rates by states as the metric.  I also do failure forecasting using Weibull or similar distributions like log-normal with right-censored data.    I don't work with machinery data which I would imagine would use a lot statistical process control, but we may start collecting certain vehicle parameter data collected by various control units installed in the car.  I know others in other departments mine social media data but I have not seen much benefit from mining unstructured data to find problems, but to gauge ""sentiment"" of our customers.  So I guess that would be more useful for market research people or design people but not people like me looking for quality problems.    I also make and maintain databases and make simple web frontends to interface with them.  I use Excel VBA, Python, and R.  We may also start using QlikView or Tableau.

datascience,2yfaba,begriffs,1 point,Mon Mar 9 08:43:57 2015 UTC,"One of the things I've found with social media is that LDA is rarely the best clustering algorithm. Mostly because it's difficult to know the ""correct"" number of topics beforehand, but also because there are extensions of LDA or other algos entirely that provide more information. Topics tend to change quickly, and emergent topics might be of more interest, especially if the goal is to 'go viral'.  I would challenge you to better defend your methodology against some of the statements you make.    What interests a large group of people today is what interested them yesterday.   I don't find this to be true, and your data doesn't support this. You shouldn't be scraping their web page when an access key is really easy, either.  I also don't get why you didn't generate a new document using LDA to try and create new tweets.  I think the major downfall of the article is the over-reliance on the algorithm. There's no guarantee that you have reliable results, either . You can cluster tweets all day, but we still aren't measuring a 'better' tweet. They may be focused on a topic (you did not prove this to be true), but I don't think we needed an algorithm for that."
datascience,2yfaba,chebyshev3,2,Wed Mar 11 00:11:58 2015 UTC,"Hey just noticed your response. Thanks for taking the time to point out the problems with how I did things. Would you recommend another way to get meaningful clusters (and find their correct number)?  Also what would be a sound way to measure better tweets? Maybe send out competing but similar tweets at roughly the same time of day and day of the week over time and see which gets more favs and RTs? It seems hard to control for all the factors that make people react to tweets, including that the underlying article being shared does get older as the experiment progresses."
datascience,2yfaba,chebyshev3,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:33:21 2015 UTC,"These are all great questions, and I don't think anyone has a correct answer. The important part is that you define the metric and create a methodology that can easily be judged against that metric.  You could define better tweets as those that are retweeted the most, which would probably align to your goal the most. Tweets could also be 'better' trolling (possibly defined by sentiment of replies?), or 'better' sharing information (defined through text rank or something? i dunno), etc.  How you record the results would be up to you.  As you mentioned, old tweets aren't that relevant and probably wouldn't get retweeted. So maybe 'better tweets' really comes down to how quickly they are posted in response to an event of some kind. I'd assume a tweet to be the first to reply to a popular tweet would also be popular, but maybe not. Maybe a few experiments are in order to explore these problems.   This is also why LDA tends to suffer in social media-- in some cases it's more important to define emerging topics rather than established topics. But then you need to figure out if it's better to be really relevant in a small topic or almost relevant in a large topic.   I've found agglomerative clustering to be better than LDA in some cases. Especially if you're dealing with just data science tweets, LDA may group tweets together that you think should be separate. HAC tends to let you see how groups are being created, and you have the ability to define the number of groups you want afterward. The biggest problem there is defining a good distance metric to use."

It's a data scientist's dream.  Also, the forums are also very supportive and full of people who know what they're doing. It really is a fantastic way to learn what data science is and get better at it."
datascience,2ydb0v,alexgmcm,2,Mon Mar 9 01:44:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with /u/Graydyn. You don't need any experience to get started. Remember that most of the code that you've probably seen has been from top Kagglers, and is therefore a bit advanced."
datascience,2ydb0v,patrickSwayzeNU,-1,Sun Mar 8 23:50:39 2015 UTC,Huh? I thought most of the time they just use ensemble methods with a crapton of weak classifiers - so it performs quite well but isn't practical in industry...  I don't really like Kaggle as a learning material as you don't really have the experience of data cleaning and so on. I think it's more beneficial to do something with a real dataset (and there are loads on /r/datasets etc.) - although some of the things on Kaggle are really cool.

I combine investigative data analysis - checking in with business users, translating their sometimes vague requests into research questions, finding data sources, vetting the sources - doing the analysis and making business recommendations.  Sometimes I build out predictive models - other times I investigate evidence to support or invalidate key business hypothesis. I do some database work (operations research), statistics, and combining data  and maps in a web app.   I have considered taking on one more client this year.  Will probably not look at anything less than $150 an hour.  If I were doing this in the context of a big consulting company the fee would be much more like $400 an hour.  Having said all that, I remember times working for $30 to $35 an hour - economy was bad and I need the money.  Pricing is strange and sometimes you cannot really wait for the right client to come along so you compromise and they get a great deal."

datascience,2yatjn,DeltaPunch,7,Sun Mar 8 02:26:59 2015 UTC,"Bokeh is higher level; you should be able to create usable, informative visualizations with much less effort. Lots of functionality is included ""out of the box"". And you can interact with it directly from Python, so if your data is already in Python it may be much more convenient in terms of programming interface and infrastructure (you don't have to set up a web server/ship data over to a browser/etc., Bokeh does that for you).  D3.js is lower level. I see it as essentially a toolbelt more than a visualization package; it's a great library for building your own visualization package though (or a set of one-off custom visualizations). The types of high-level charts that Bokeh can produce with a few lines of code might take more like tens of lines of non-obvious code in D3.js. But the upside with such a low-level tool is this: you have much better control over render target (svg vs. canvas), rendering itself (what elements get rendered where), styling and presentation, etc. And through those (and because D3 itself has no opinions or infrastructure for getting data to the browser), you have flexibility around the tradeoffs of performance, responsiveness, etc. whereas in Bokeh everything follows the same data-flow architecture and rendering path."

It's just a lot of GLMs run in SAS. There's also next to no CS or machine learning component.   I self-learned python in large part because we needed to integrate dynamic analyses of the data into a study that provided patients with real time feedback, which none of the biostats faculty knew how to do. So I think it's largely the broad skillset of data science that draws me in over traditional biostatistics."

They definitely do more advanced stats + machine learning stuff.   If I were you, I would spend some time honestly looking into biostats, I'm sure some of it is dull (just like some data analysis jobs are dull), but there's cool stuff to be found."

From what I recall, the top programs would require a Math GRE as well.   You should reach out to the professors at your prospective schools and discuss research possibilities and assess how well you'd fit in to their program. Put a face to a name, etc.  I've even heard of cases where the application is a moot point or can even be avoided if you have a faculty member vouch for you.

I accepted to several medical schools, but I have more or less decided not to attend.

I'll echo what others have said - do well on the GRE and you'll be fine. Write a good and convincing SOP. GL!  If you are interested in a PhD program, you can usually get a masters in another field concurrently (i.e. PhD in biostats, master in data science). Not sure if I'd recommend that, though, as many of the MS data science programs are geared towards being able to jump into industry after with the relevant skills."

Kaggle problems, very focused on AUC optimization and feature engineering. Real business problems, very focused on a specific type of technology (Hadoop, Luigi, Spark etc.)   The books you might want to look at are:   Programming Collective Intelligence Agile Data Science Data Science for Business/Doing Data Science   You should be able to get all of these from the online selection of your uni library.

I started reading the Hadoop O'Reilly book and it seems nice. Do you feel like reading the ""Python Data Analysis"" or ""Mining the Social Web"" and other books are useful? Specifically, I mean to ask if you think these books are dense with information.   I'm looking on Amazon at all of these cool looking O'Reilly books and I'm wondering if I should spend the time to read them or if my time is better spent with other books. I noticed however that reading through O'Reilly books is very fast and easy for me, it must be the density of information or the gentle formatting or wording of it all, but they seem kind of 'easy.' Is this also the case for you? That's why I was asking if they're worth reading."
datascience,2y6qzp,will-stanton,2,Sat Mar 7 11:42:44 2015 UTC,"They (and a lot of data science books) are very hit and miss. I use Pandas every day and I hardly ever touch Python Data Analysis - I would only recommend getting it if you don't use Pandas very much but expect you will in the future. The way that I work, is that I come across a problem i.e. Filter Groupby results according to a function based on Index, Google it for Stack Overflow results and the documentation (and sometimes mailing lists) then if I can't find an answer I might go to the book, or search Github Issues and notice that its something that a lot of people complain about and solve the problem in a less elegant way. I imagine the same is for most books on a specific technology - I do have a handful of O'Reilly books and the best ones for me are ones that are less focused on algorithms and technology, and more focused on ideas - unless it is a brand new technology which has poor documentation and bugger all written about it.  You can rule out about half of the O'Reilly books purely on their reviews - a lot try to be technology focused and aren't dense enough. I have found books by esteemed people in their field are the ones worth reading i.e. Stephen Few for Data Vis, Wes McKinney for Pandas - otherwise focus on books which use multiple technologies that you are interested in (i.e. Postgres + Redis + Python or something)"

datascience,2y34tr,chubbywuzzy,3,Fri Mar 6 00:55:22 2015 UTC,"So there's two issues at play that are inevitably intertwined - academics and social life. Academically and professionally, school choice usually matters for your first job, but after that it's not weighed heavily. I know of many companies that will likely not look at resumes unless it's a top school, which eliminates a couple schools on your list. Berkeley and Stanford would probably be the top choices for breaking into the Bay Area scene, especially for an internship. If you can manage to boost your GPA slightly, it will be much more advantageous than getting a better GPA at a lower tier school. Perhaps you need to work on your study skills? If you got into Berkeley, a 3.5 is likely very attainable while having a social life.  With that being said, just because you go to a middle/lower tier undergraduate school does not mean you can't get into a top graduate school. But, admissions will know that a Berkeley GPA will probably be weighted higher than your average middle tier. In the end, your hard work will be reflected in your application, which includes not only your GPA, but also your leadership positions, extracurriculars, research experience, and internships/work experience.   If you're not happy socially at Berkeley, then maybe there's other issues. Perhaps you're not seeking out social opportunities or your attitude needs adjusting? Or maybe Berkeley just isn't the place for you. I think first and foremost you need to be happy with your life in order to succeed academically, so I'd ask what you want in a school. Social life? Sports? Big/small student population? Many of the schools you listed are far different from Berkeley, so that may be a good or bad thing. For example, Notre Dame is in the middle of nowhere, and SMU will be on the opposite spectrum as Berkeley. Either way, there's no rush. Don't let anyone push you to go back to school if you're not ready. One option is to take a year off, work, and reaccess your options.   I went to USC and thought it was a good balance of academic and social life while being in a city. If I had gone to a more rigorous and challenging school like Stanford I'd imagine I would have missed out on many of the social opportunities."
datascience,2y34tr,CheesingmyBrainsOut,1 point,Fri Mar 6 01:40:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your thorough reply. Perhaps I'm doing something wrong. I mean my social scene is not too terrible, but I never really clicked with the school itself. Still feels foreign too me and all, and the people generally don't intrigue me that much. Bay Area is cool and all but I feel I would like SB, LA scene much better due to weather and all. But I still want to have the opportunity of having a city like SF where I can earn internships but I guess there are always summers. What is your recommendation? I mean I'm ready to go back to school, but if I were to take more time off, I will only allow myself one more semester. I will 22 as a junior and having friends your age seem better for me rather than being looked as that ""old dude"". Haha"
datascience,2y34tr,CheesingmyBrainsOut,1 point,Fri Mar 6 02:24:15 2015 UTC,"I actually grew up in the bay area and wanted a change, which is why I opted for USC over Cal. So it all really depends what you're feeling. Personally I loved LA for college, great weather and tons to do. Los Angeles and Santa Barbara have great schools - UCLA, USC, UC Santa Barbara, Loyola. I'd also look into San Diego - UCSD. The Claremont schools are a decent drive outside of LA, so it would have a different feel. I would definitely visit them and take tours before you make a decision. You mentioned the deadline passed for UC's, but perhaps waiting another year or for spring transfer (is that still a thing?) would be worth it?  As far as internships, you don't need to be in the bay area, though the networking would put you at a slight advantage. If you go to career fairs and do everything right, you'll be able to get an internship in the bay area.   I wouldn't worry about being too old, 22 as a junior is not that old. As you get older, age becomes less of an issue. For example, I'd classify 21-24 as basically the same age. Many people take a year off before starting in undergrad, so they would be at your same level. Socially, if you're interested in joining a fraternity, they're a great way to meet people despite what naysayers have to say, especially if you're a Junior transfer."

Do you want to study pure math like algebra and analysis for a couple semesters or do you want to go straight to the applied stuff? If you choose the math program then you will probably have to work on your own time to make yourself employable. I don't know if the same is true for Columbia. These are some things to consider.

As for commute, I walk to work, but it takes about 20 minutes, so I listen to data science podcasts (partially derivative, talking machines, data stories, etc) just to get a sense of the field and some techniques. I've also been trying to find any place that I can do data science related work at work. I've been somewhat successful with this."

datascience,2xzxhi,SamCuse,4,Fri Mar 6 04:36:49 2015 UTC,"I'm doing an online master's from Syracuse University - the name of the master's is Information Management and they have a Data Science certificate TBH, it is probably not as heavy into data science as some other degrees, but I think it gets the job done. I also work at the university, so the degree is very heavily subsidized, which helped me make my decision. So, I work all day, see if I can build in anything I'm learning into the work I'm doing, and then after my daughter goes to sleep I get to work on class stuff. Most times I do 2-3 hours of work a night, last night I had a big assignment due, so I essentially pulled an all-nighter. I'm definitely short of sleep, but I'm hoping the work now will pay off for later.  For podcasts, I listed to so many (nice to have about a 20 minute walk to work, also listen when shoveling/mowing lawn). The data related ones are (just search on iTunes for all of these): - Partially Derivative: overview of the week's data science stories. They do a good job of keeping things easy to understand but still explain well. - Talking Machines: All about Machine Learning with interviews of experts in the field. Sometimes this goes a little over my head, but good to hear from people who are the best at it. - Data Skeptic Podcast: interviews and overviews about data science related topics - Freakonomics: not necessarily data science, but good for remembering to think differently about the world, which I think is important when analyzing data and preparing to present results - IBM Big Data & Analytics Hub: They don't publish very often, but again good to hear from leaders in the field - Data Stories: Data viz & interviews with experts - Linear Digressions: From Udacity instructors, exploring machine learning concepts - O'Reilly Data Show: Just started with this one, but again talking about data science.    Non data science podcasts: Invisibilia, Serial, StartUp, Common Sense With Dan Carlin, Ted Radio Hour, Savage Lovecast, Slate's Political Gabfest, Radiolab, This American Life, Reply All  edited for formatting"

Independent projects do two very important things:   They show that you are super interested in data science They prove that you can actually do something, not just complete homework assignments.    Your independent projects could be nearly anything:   Kaggle competitions (the easiest way to get started) Download Hadoop onto your local machine and do the tutorial. Try running an analysis on a dataset you like. It really doesn't matter much what it is.

I wouldn't worry too much about LSA vs. LDA or anything like that right now. Most text mining approaches aren't really that different fundamentally. Often, if one method works, another one would also work, just maybe not as well. If you are using Python, you might consider using the gensim library. He has some nice tutorials here, including one where he does LSA on Wikipedia. It is actually really easy to use -- the hardest part is structuring your data smartly in advance so you it's easy to load the data into Python. The best thing about gensim is that it is super robust with regard to the size of the data, so you might not need that much computing power to get started.  I gave a recent presentation on one use-case of gensim that you can find on my blog. PM me if you have any questions."

datascience,2xvhuf,rishsriv,2,Wed Mar 4 06:01:57 2015 UTC,"Glad that helped. Was on mobile earlier, so couldn't be more detailed. Here are some things to keep in mind (based on my experience, might not be good advice in all cases):   Database design is extremely important. Give some thought to how you design your database classes so you are able to extract data without making more DB calls than necessary. Log everything! Given how cheap storage is, you should not be wasting any data. Log when a user logs into the site, what buttons/links (s)he clicks and at what time, the referral site (if any), everything that you possibly can. At the same time, design your log-plans well at the beginning and try to keep them as consistent as possible as time goes on. This will ensure that your future data-scientists don't have to spend most of their time in cleaning and standardizing data, and can be more productive when working for you. They'll love you for it. Use the right tech stack and cloud services. GAE with Python tends to be a bad choice because it can't handle anything that's not pure python. I've had to create RESTful API on Heroku for a few GAE-based clients because scikit-learn and NLTK don't work with GAE (unless you use Managed VMs, which are a pain). This created unnecessary latency in the system. Heroku and AWS are much better choices. Python-based tech stacks (generally) seems to be a good option as Python has an extremely mature analytics ecosystem that can play well with your apps. In particular, if you're going to use Natural Language Processing heavily, Python-based stacks are very very useful.   Good luck!"

I personally use R more because there are more cutting-edge statistics packages available when I need them. Sometimes you don't want to wait months for a port or to port them yourself.  In terms of knowing one versus the other, they're all (essentially) imperative programming languages and should have little to no transition time when alternating.  This isn't a c++ vs haskell conversation ;)"
datascience,2xn7x2,blank964,3,Mon Mar 2 16:41:45 2015 UTC,"So I'm using both R and Python quite regularly.   R is great for prototyping, testing different approaches or testing new methods. Because most researchers are using R, new methods are often first available in R before in other languages. But R is not a ""full"" programming language, so it is hard (and generally a bad idea) to write production code in R. The preprocessing in R is great if you already have your data in table form.  Python on the other hand is a full and very versatile programming language. I'm using Python for everything where R gets copious, e.g. web scraping, interaction with a lot of databases, transformation of raw and unstructured data. Depending on the requirements of the tasks it is mostly easier to write code that is ready for production and is better maintainable. Another reason to use Python is because there are a lot more interfaces to other programming languages and tools, for example to torch for deep learning or to openCV for image processing.  tl.dr.: R for prototyping of solutions and simulations, when you already have your data in usable format.

I do a heap of web scraping in R (HTML, JSON, XML), interfaced with databases (MySQL, SQLite) along with data manipulation and calculations.  R is a diverse language capable of a lot of different things depending on what you hope to achieve, but the leaning curve is steeper than that of Python.   The benefits of R are balanced by its lack of speed in certain things. Loops can be hundreds of times slower than the equivalent C++ code, though that can be mitigated by the fact that R will gladly interface with a variety of other languages (e.g. Rcpp).   The mantra I've heard is that if you need to do something, there's probably 0 or 1 ways to do it in Python, 20 good ways to do it in R, and 10 bad ways to do it in R.   My advice is to learn both if you can and be able to decide which tool is best suited to the job at hand when that time comes."

Since you're still in college do you have any friends / friends of friends who are going into data analytics?  Ask them first.  Then talk to the alumni office / career placement center at your university/college about their advice. They are paid to help students like you so by all means take advantage of their help.  Then look at some career websites for ""Data analytics"" jobs and try to find some that appeal to you. For instance - if you are into USA basketball, there are lots of companies and NBA teams who hire data analysts. Same with all of the other sports. Think of what you like to do / read / study / think about and search for those key words and then ""Data analytics"" afterwards.  For instance, you have a specialization in accounting/finance. You could look up ""finance data analytics"" - of which Google responds with ""16,200,000"" pages for you.  Advice specifically to your interest in data visualization  Data visualization is a huge growing field that is also moving very fast. There are lots of vendor tools (tableau, etc) and open source libraries (gephii, d3.js, etc)... The great thing about data visualization is that data analysts use it to communicate with non-data people, so regardless of what interests and areas you end up (from the broad advice section), you'll be able to use data viz.

I have a BS in Accounting but my career interest is more in data science.  Here is the path I took/am taking:  Financial Analyst -> Customer Insights Analyst -> CRM analyst -> Data Modeler -> ???  A background in finance/accounting sets you up for a financial analyst role pretty nicely.  You'd be working with data sets, financial metrics, etc.  You'll become an expert in Excel and analytical thinking if you aren't already.  I've seen several people in my company transition from FA to a customer analyst role, which measures financial metrics centered around customer segments over time.  This role requires pulling data from a database.  In my experience SQL wasn't required to get the job, but you learned it on the job.  After this I transitioned to be a CRM analyst (customer insights on marketing campaigns) where I had to learn Base SAS to do things like statistical A/B testing of campaigns, more complex data manipulation that SQL alone cannot do, and automated dashboards of customer data.  This is where I currently am.  Here is what I am doing to get me to the next step: I work with our statistical analysis manager to learn how he builds predictive response models. I am taking online courses (MOOCS) to learn new skills in Python, R, linear algebra, and calculus.  I recommend codecademy and teamleada for interactive learning.  Coursera and edX are good for learning videos.    The overall theme of this story is that each step leads to the next in a natural progression of roles.  In other words it's not difficult to convince a hiring manager why you're making these moves.  Although finance to data modeling is a career change, I see it more of a small detour since I am willing to make a few stops along the way."

The worst mistake I made was wasting time reading through books. There is too much to learn and not enough time to get through any of them.

Kaggle is a great place to start: https://www.kaggle.com/  If you are really strapped for ideas then I would start with the book ""Introduction to Statistical Learning"". Although it is meant to be a ""dumbed down"" version of Elements of Statistical Learning, it actually has labs and meaningful exercises, which EoSL does not. If you have a Stats background then you can skip a lot of the content quite quickly and go right to the end to work on the labs and exercises.

Upon completing the task you've grown from the experience, expanded your toolbox and hopefully discovered easier ways of transforming data etc.  Where to start depends heavily on your experience but more importantly the project at hand.  For a beginner I would recommend picking a personal project and figure out what type of data you want to store and how it might look. This doesn't have to be specific at first. Even though this is related to the second portion, transform, of ETL it's important to have a good schema or vision of your goals as this is the foundation of the project. Note this requires knowledge of data to be extracted which brings us to:  Extract, which can be as simple as opening a file to connecting a database or even scraping a website etc. Again this depends on the path you choose  Load: This can be as easy as a one time transfer of the data, or maybe run daily from a scheduled task, or even constantly synchronized with some form of replication.  This goes back to the projects needs.  If you have a specific project you're thinking of feel free to share it will probably be easier to break down than just a general overview."

I suppose that it's the project that I'm lacking... basically the only data I've played with is from kaggle.com, and it almost always consists of .csv files which I load with a line or two of Python. So I'm spending less than 1% of my time on cleaning/loading my data and know that this is far from the day-to-day realities of this type of work.  For instance, libraries like http://petl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ look great and I'd love to give them a try. I suppose I could do something silly, like try to predict tweets or something. But I'm lacking a project that has some challenging ETL aspects, or requires the building of a small data warehouse, to even get started with learning these aspects of the profession. Perhaps I just need a little more imagination..."
datascience,2xf5sf,patrickSwayzeNU,2,Sat Feb 28 06:35:46 2015 UTC,"Just because you can load it into Python in 2 lines doesn't mean it is clean. For example, I got a new dataset at work which was I think 3 lines to import (SELECT * In SQL and 2 lines of python to open the db connection and pandas.read_sql) but it took about 100 LOC to actually make the data useful. These 100 lines were things like applying filters, removing outliers and converting some variables to something actually useful which I'm not at liberty to discuss.  ETL is more for running automatic/scheduled jobs to clean data, for example downloading tweets, cleaning them, updating some metrics on them and putting them into a database. However, if you read some interviews with Kaggle winners, you will see that they generally load data into SQL databases so the data is more flexible on disk - for you I'd suggest SQLite or Postgres."

""Optimize"" here can mean many things - choosing the right ad units to display, or matching users to products, users to users, etc. Take those classes, they're important."
datascience,2x9ty5,mgmuscari,3,Thu Feb 26 23:38:04 2015 UTC,Thank you! This is the kind of direct answer I was looking for.
datascience,2x9ty5,cdninbuffalo,5,Fri Feb 27 00:10:37 2015 UTC,"Here's another opinion: if you're interested just the data science aspects of optimization, I suggest studying convex optimization. Many (most?) optimization problems in statistics involve either linear or convex optimization (rarely nonconvex nonlinear).   There's a free book here on Convex Optimization, and free online course out of Stanford. This course is EXCELLENT. http://stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/ https://class.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/CVX101/Winter2014/about  Remarks   If you really want to take courses, you might want to take the linear + nonlinear, but really, the part that will be relevant to your interests is the convex optimization part. My feeling is that your time is better spent taking a convex optimization course directly (see Boyd course above). Discrete optimization is rarely used in data science (at least not that I've seen), but is extremely useful in many other operations research related fields (optimal planning and scheduling, vehicle routing, etc.).  In statistical/learning algorithms, the optimization portion is usually the side show. It's good to know how to formulate an well-posed optimization problem, but you don't really need to know all the intricacies of optimization to use any algorithm.  That said, one of the concomitant benefits of taking a good (convex) optimization course is that you'll pick up bits and pieces of Real Analysis along the way (if you don't already have a background in analysis). This will aid you tremendously in  understanding machine learning publications.   My background: data scientist with Ph.D. in nonlinear optimization."
datascience,2x9ty5,sshank314,2,Fri Feb 27 23:42:33 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, with a Ph. D. in nonlinear optimization... what department did you do your degree in? And how difficult was it to make the transition to data science?"
datascience,2x9ty5,cdninbuffalo,2,Sat Feb 28 00:24:12 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, I got mine from the school of engineering instead of math; I was working on very applied problems that spanned optimization, statistics, and computer science.  I barely use any optimization in my job these days. A lot of data science problems aren't actually that technical.   For a technical person who wanted to learn lots of algorithms and apply them, this was the most disillusioning part. And also the best opportunity I've had for personal growth in a while.   If you want to have an impact you REALLY REALLY need to understand the business side of things so you can work on high leverage projects. Building data and algorithm pipelines and such is just a matter of execution -- any reasonably competent team can implement those. Finding the right business questions to ask in the first place is much tougher. I didn't  learn that in school.   Here's the perspective of Michael Hochster (former director of data science at LinkedIn and statistician at Google): http://www.quora.com/Would-you-hire-a-mathematician-with-limited-statistics-knowledge-for-a-data-scientist-role/answer/Michael-Hochster   I don't care that much about statistical knowledge, but I do care about demonstrated interest and ability in working with data. Strong math people don't always have that. Math is a tidy subject, while data science is often very very very messy."
datascience,2x9ty5,cdninbuffalo,1 point,Sat Feb 28 19:26:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your substantive answer and expertise! To be honest, I have never heard of convex optimization before, but I took another look at the course descriptions, and it might appear in in the non-linear optimization class?   Nonlinear Optimization: Maximization and minimization of nonlinear functions, constrained and unconstrained; nonlinear programming problems and methods. Lagrange multipliers; Kuhn-Tucker conditions, convexity. Quadratic programming.   Also, the linear optimization class (2nd in the series) does require Real Analysis 1 as a prerequisite, so I will be taking that.  So you're saying that it might not be worth it to take any of these classes? Perhaps do independent study on specifically what would be useful? I have to think about that.  One thing is that I need a certain number of math department classes in order to graduate.  I'm thinking that these might be the closest thing to useful, so i might as well use them to help fulfill that graduation requirement.  I am also taking a series of statistics classes on probability, and I was thinking discrete mathematical modeling, but I'm not sure how useful that is."
datascience,2x9ty5,cdninbuffalo,0,Sat Feb 28 01:26:02 2015 UTC,"Good for you. Well, if there are courses that are more closely aligned to your interests in data science (e.g. courses in statistics, visualization, databases etc.), take those. Optimization is really quite peripheral to data science -- if you really want to learn the skills specific to data science, study statistical modeling, databases and programming (R and Python). And try to get internships.  If you are truly interested in applied optimization, consider not doing data science; instead, look into Operations Research or Indsutrial Engineering. These combine statistics and optimization, and you will get to work on very applied problems.   Data science is far too overhyped right now, so everyone and their cousin is trying to get into it. There are number of peripheral fields that are much more established that might be a better fit.  The nonlinear optimization course description (if that is the full description) sounds like it's an introductory course, so you'll definitely benefit from that without getting into too much other stuff that you won't need.

datascience,2x4k60,fitnessdl,10,Wed Feb 25 16:43:11 2015 UTC,"Some models are found in both ML and Stats (Such as linear or logistic regression, PCA) and they sometimes vary in their implementation. The advantage of ML is that it doesn't always need to hold all the assumptions Stats does, but it also often is more of a black box compared to statistics, which is great if you only care about prediction, but it means your model might not always make sense from an interpretation standpoint.  I would say the two complement each other very well. You can do ML without Stats knowledge, but it helps.  While I come from a Stats background, this is a great video on the differences between ML and Stats in favour of ML:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dnw46eC-0o#t=49"

datascience,2x4k60,somkoala,1 point,Wed Feb 25 18:05:42 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say so I see techniques from both as valid on a case by case basis having their pros and cons you have to be aware of when deciding between the two.  Having said that some of the approaches coming from ML (or Data Mining which is kind of a middle ground between Stats and ML) make use of computing power that wasn't available when lots of Stats techniques were invented and thus allow you to sometimes come to much more substantial conclusions (think target shuffling vs p-values or measuring predictive accuracy vs pseudo R2 measures for logistic regression).
datascience,2x4k60,patrickSwayzeNU,-1,Wed Feb 25 18:21:15 2015 UTC,"I'm still at a loss for when you'd want to use PCA in ML.  I'm tempted to say it's worthless, but I'm holding out that someone can point out something I'm overlooking.  Need dimensionality reduction?  Perform feature selection.  Plus it seems silly to manipulate the feature space while completely ignoring the labels."
datascience,2x4k60,somkoala,1 point,Wed Feb 25 21:44:54 2015 UTC,"I think your PCA question is a good one. I have seen PCA taught as a part of ML (Andrew NG), but it wasn't said why it was that important. While you may be right, I will try to give you some reasons why it might be included in the tool set:   There is simply so much overlap between Stats, Data Mining and ML, that people tend to ignore the already blurred borders A modelling reason - it seems that if you are building a neural network, one way to achieve a good setup is to set up the number of neurons in the hidden layer equal to the number of components you'd get based on PCA. Sometimes performing PCA means the variance you lose is in fact noise which might help improve the model. This is just my speculation, but PCA comes with some loss in variability, but it might well be that in cases with lots of features there might be a tradeoff in which the loss of explanatory power through PCA is lower than the loss in terms of removing the features at the same number of features that might go into the model (or might even be lower in PCA and then we could go with Occam's razor) Lots of ML happens on images and one point I've just found through Google is that in such cases you might not always have all that many observations, but have lots of features and PCA is used a lot   So All in all I think the usefulness of PCA in regards to ML depends on your dataset. I however disagree with your point about manipulating the feature space being silly - isn't for example feature scaling also a manipulation that ignores the labels, but helps the model?"
datascience,2x4k60,bilateralconfusion,1 point,Thu Feb 26 07:27:32 2015 UTC,Overall pretty good but a few follow up points  For every feature you put into pca you get a component back out.  It's up to you to decide what components to drop and to understand the benefits and pitfalls of doing so  Alao don't use pca when the number of features is greater than the number of observations. You certainly can apply the algorithm but the results are less robust
datascience,2x4k60,NedDasty,1 point,Thu Feb 26 13:02:06 2015 UTC,"When the number of features is greater than the number of observations, your data necessarily live in a smaller dimensional subspace than your number of features initially anyway. PCA's not any less robust in this case."
datascience,2x4k60,patrickSwayzeNU,1 point,Thu Feb 26 19:17:18 2015 UTC,"Regarding the silly manipulation without considering the labels - excellent retort.  I stand by my point, but I lacked precision in my language.  ""Manipulate"" was far too broad since as you pointed out, scaling is a manipulation of the feature space.  There's significant difference, however, between PCA and scaling.  Obviously, I can describe the difference by defining these two things, but if someone can come up with an elegant description/analogy, that'd be great.  To point 3: I'm sure that it can mitigate some noise, but AFAIK there's not much theoretical reason to expect it to and since there are an infinite number of random things you can do to your feature space that can help it doesn't make much sense to single this out as a benefit.  Plus, if you happen to have a variable in your set that doesn't ""belong"" then you should absolutely expect it to add noise to your principle components, no?  Again, correct me if I'm overstepping any points here.  To Point 4:  Pretty much the same argument I had for point 3.  There are quite a few things that can work, but we need to narrow our ""bag of tricks"" down to things we expect to work (the degree of expectation obviously depending on how much time we have).  To Point 5:  Interesting, I'll have to check that out.  Edit:  I want to say ""twisting"" or ""transforming"" the feature space, but that still isn't good.  Someone help me out here."
datascience,2x4k60,somkoala,1 point,Thu Feb 26 14:42:23 2015 UTC,"I do not have a strong opinion either way, but I thought it was interesting to try to find the reasons why someone might include PCA in the ML toolbox - just to clarify my position. So let me reply to some of your previous points and add 2 more:   As for point 3: If a variable doesn't belong it would probably not have all that much shared variance with the remaining variables which means it would probably end up as a trivial component and you would exclude it based on the cut off point based on some of the methods. If there was a fair share of such variables your time is probably better spent trying to figure out how the variables got into the set in the first place and excluding them based on their predictive power or some other criteria, than trying to find a PCA solution that singles such variables out.   It might speed up a deployed algorithm and it reduces the space occupied by the data. Especially since the results of a PCA are uncorrelated and having too many correlated variables means you have too many unnecessary features carrying the same information. Granted, you are able to filter such variables out, but it might be easier to just go with PCA in some cases. If you k-means uses euclidean distances it assumes the features are uncorrelated, if you use other distance metrics you do not have to care so much. Interpretability - this doesn't have as much to do with the predictive power, but it we get interpretable factors / principal components and then perform a k-means with 5 factors, it might be much simpler than interpreting clusters based on 50 variables."
datascience,2x4k60,patrickSwayzeNU,2,Thu Feb 26 15:31:57 2015 UTC,"""If there was a fair share of such variables your time is probably better spent trying to figure out how the variables got into the set in the first place and excluding them based on their predictive power or some other criteria, than trying to find a PCA solution that singles such variables out.""  I'm glad you pointed that out.  This is a big key point IMO since this is exactly the situation I TRY to find myself in with ML.  For example, risk stratifying a healthcare population.  I do not know, a priori, what variables will be more useful than others in predicting HC cost, so the typical approach is to include all variable that can reasonably be extracted that seem to be of interest (usually informed by subject matter expertise).  BUT, I can see your point in a situation where you have a very limited set of available inputs, all of which have a theoretical reason for ""belonging"".  I think I am missing your point 3.  Doesn't PCA inherently create uninterpretable factors or am I defining ""interpretable"" from too much of a ""how they relate to the inputs"" perspective for your taste?"
datascience,2x4k60,somkoala,2,Thu Feb 26 16:06:44 2015 UTC,"While Factor analysis generally seeks more interpretation than PCA (you can use different rotations to see what makes sense), you can still interpret the components / factors based on their correlations / factor loadings on original variables. A very simplified example would be analysing user behaviour on reddit with the variables number of posts, number of submissions, time spent on site, number of clicks on headlines, number of clicks on comments. Now of course all of this would be correlated, but you might find a factor with strong loadings on the first 2 variables while a second factor would have strong loadings on the 3 remaining variables. You could then interpret the first factor as content creation, while the second factor would be content consumption. Of course this isn't a perfect example since the people who read more probaby also contribute more, but I've used it for the sake of argument."

The reason why it's not directly applicable is because the features are initialized in an unsupervised way, but are modified thereafter according to the signal that's back-propagated.  This is starkly different from PCA prior to, for example, linear regression.  BUT, I didn't specify and spoke broadly.  You correctly pointed out a counter example based on my lack of precision."

datascience,2x4k60,deeayecee,2,Thu Feb 26 01:33:43 2015 UTC,"There's actually a good bit on this in the wikipedia article on the history of machine learning:   As a scientific endeavour, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence. Already in the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed ""neural networks""; mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics. Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.[10]  However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.[10] By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.[11] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming, but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.[10]Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as ""connectionism"", by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield, Rumelhart and Hinton. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.[10]  Machine learning, reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory.[11] It also benefited from the increasing availability of digitized information, and the possibility to distribute that via the internet."

All models for non-trivial problems are inaccurate - though perhaps this was more of a segue than a point.  ""The problem starts with the industry’s appraisal model of valuation and becomes more acute as you automate the model with computer programs.""  Maybe it does and maybe it doesn't.  This is a question to be answered empirically, not theoretically.  We're certainly adding bias by excluding ""the flow of a home"" as data, but there is also certainly a reduction of modeler variance (appraisers).  At least with the algorithm, buyers/sellers can adjust the valuation based on perception of flow or other ""intangibles"".  They can't (without getting several human valuations), adjust for appraiser variance.  ""But how do you decide the dollar amount to adjust between a home 3,300 square feet in size and another that’s 3,100 square feet? How much do you adjust for the difference between four bedrooms and three bedrooms?""  Algorithmically.  I feel like I'm missing your point here.

datascience,2x0uz9,jtkme,7,Wed Feb 25 10:22:49 2015 UTC,"The Gartner curve is a good example of arbitrarily projecting data onto a mental construct. There is no reason to assume these phrases of technologies/buzz-words/whatever-the-fuck would all follow the same shape over time as measured in whatever-the-fuck 'expectations' are. And hence, no reason to believe 'data science' is about to go over a peak and 'big data' has.  That said, yeah terms go in and out of fashion. Data scientist is a more established position now (Microsoft, Facebook, etc have workers with this title) and it will just be renamed.

More to the point, the problem with Data Science is that it's such a broad umbrella that it was never really a well-defined buzzword, and so you had people wanting to hire data scientists without really knowing what they do. My guess is that as the field slowly becomes better understood, you'll see it fragment. Instead of looking for data scientists, people will be looking for statisticians and machine learning scientists and data visualization experts, etc.   In some ways it will look like the hype wave has passed and we've gone back to discussing the old jobs again. There will be a key difference, however. People in these fields will now be expected to know how to work with large data sets, whereas in the past working with large datasets was considered more of a specialty than a core concept."

A good software developer can pick up on the neccesarry stats knowledge for many applications, atleast regarding business applications. the real quants will always be able to get by with just scripting but many of these people are re-nowned researchers and such. so yeah..i expect it to require lots of programming skills on top of having the neccesarry data skills as well. i need to get my ass into gear, i really dont like programmming but i know its something i need to get better at."

Because of this, and because there will just be more and more data, I think data professionals are going to become more ubiquitous, not less. I avoid using the term data science/scientist because most companies are not going to pay a PhD $150 000 a year to rummage through their data. So while it's possible that the data science hype is about to crash and burn, people working with data as their full-time job I think is here to stay."

Everything else to the left of the peak is currently estimated at >= 5 years to plateau with a sizeable chunk at 10+ years. So while we may be hitting the wrong part of the hype curve soon, 'data science' is estimated to pull through much faster than anything else shown.  Yes, there needs to be a vendor shakeout. Yes, people need to learn how to better understand data so it isn’t left up to “magicians”. Yes, PR and marketing departments will eventually find a new shiny and 'data science' won't be the cool kid anymore. And yes, you might get a few eye rolls over the next couple of years.  But if something truly adds value just focus on the fundamentals and stay consistent. For better or worse, people seem to associate ‘data analytics’, ‘advanced analytics’, ‘data analysis’, etc. with ‘data science’ now. If you change your nomenclature, only to change back in a few years when it has reached plateau (see the first sentence), I’d question if you were just chasing the latest buzz because you kept calling the same fundamental topics something different every few years."

I'm currently completing the Data Science Specialization on Coursera, and I'm finding it a great introduction to data science. Coursera also just offered a CS track that delves into python programming which could be helpful too.  My advice to anyone trying to pursue data science is to create some sort of online portfolio. Find a group online or a meetup in person to do some data projects. Make sure that you can showcase your knowledge of how you approached a problem, upload your code and summary to GitHub, and ideally, have your own website.   There are so many resources online to begin programming and build simple websites. Since you already have a start web development, you should be in a great position."

datascience,2ww6do,fitnessdl,3,Tue Feb 24 09:37:40 2015 UTC,"I think you're right - they're supposed to have great job placement, and although I've still had some gigs, I think I could still benefit. My current jobs aren't on the same level as a professional datascience position. I'm mostly running regressions for social scientists, but I occasionally get to do something cool with R and develop my skillset.   Landing crappy freelance gigs isn't hard! Just do some small ones first for like $30. They'll be awful and take WAY too long, but if you do a good job, you can get a good rating. Once you have a few 5-star ratings and show that you're fluent in english, it won't be too hard to get some good statistics/datascience/visualization contracts.   Oh and also: find a niche.

datascience,2ww6do,b1eb,2,Tue Feb 24 04:12:39 2015 UTC,"Yes I was thinking of the data science Incubator. With your background you probably would not need a bootcamp. If you needed some more experience in specific technologies it may be better to do bootcamps in those areas, like a Python bootcamp for example. I did one on Hadoop and Spark and learned a lot of great ways to implement analytics on distributed systems. I just don't feel these data science bootcamps are worth the cost. It gives me that hypey vibe that turns me off.   I had a job interview for a data scientist position (a day after my son was born) but it turned out they were looking for more of a computer scientist / engineering background than in analytics.

datascience,2wo90c,icallshenannigans,2,Sat Feb 21 17:49:32 2015 UTC,"So I am not super familiar with this stuff, but I can tell you where I would start. I would definitely start by plotting distributions of scores (e.g. a heatmap with home team score on x axis and visitor team on the y axis). I don't know how much data you have available to you, but provided you have enough data, that should give you a pretty good feel for what's going on. Then you can collapse across dimensions, look at distribution of home goals and compare them to distribution of visitor goals.      Once you understand what's going on a bit better, you can start looking at the individual teams and modelling this stuff. A Poisson process might be appropriate here (at least it would be in football/soccer, I don't know how goals/scores work in rugby) and lambda, the rate parameter, will depend on the team. For example, a very good team might have a higher rate parameter than a bad team and so on. Maybe a GLM could work here too which would allow you to throw in a bunch of parameters. It's really hard to say anything sophisticated without knowing more about your problem (at least for me, maybe someone else has some deeper insight). I don't know if there are any really clever ways of modelling two simultaneous outcomes, but I would start with modelling them independently (i.e. in parallel). It's almost certainly not true that the rate parameters will be independent of one another, but that's a simplification that you're probably willing to make on your first pass of this problem.      EDIT: The fivethirtyeight link posted by /u/SamCuse seems to do something similar to what I suggested (which I'll take as a personal win! :p), but probably is way more insightful."

It turns out rugby is an amazingly erratic game by the numbers compared to the likes of soccer, american football, baseball ect. I remember a NZ game a few years back where they only had a small portion of territory, but were winning by a big margin. Looking at the numbers this makes no sense, but the reason they had such little ""territory"" was because they were receiving kick off into their half, playing a few phases and then running the entire pitch to score!  The best model I could find to predict outcomes was amazingly subjective - calling for experts' input to weight the positivity/negativity of aspects of a game.   Its complexity is something that I love about rugby, but makes it very hard to predictively analyse."

datascience,2wmush,dataschmata,5,Sat Feb 21 06:35:04 2015 UTC,"From a Product Manager:  A good product manager doesn't dictate features. Good product managers identify problems. I apologize if that sounds a bit like marketing speak, so let me clarify:  In my world (Product Manager at DataSift, I spend quite a bit of time thinking about what aspects of our own market suck. Then I spend a smaller portion of my time thinking about what aspects of our own product / offering suck. What I don't do is build delineated lists of features that I want to add. The reason being is that we've hired smart engineers and data scientists to decide how best to go after solving problems, and they're deeply familiar with our product. My job is to make sure what we want to build is going to serve our market better than our competition, that we can build and sell it for a reasonable cost (so we're not losing money or pricing ourselves out of the deal), and that it fits within the larger goal / direction / vision of the company and executive team.   In fact, Pragmatic Marketing and many folks I've spoken to agree: Product Managers don't need to be at the center of defining features - we need to be responsible for being experts in our market and our customers. This takes a bit of humbleness on our part, because historically people get into product management to become captains of their respective products / product lines, not just market experts.  So...how does all this answer OP's question?  I think it's important for product managers to define roadmaps at high levels - they're honestly going to be able to spend their time and energy getting to know the market and being able to answer more authoritatively (and usually, with data / customer input) whether the thing you want to build is just cool, or will actually sell. This is where product manager-defined roadmaps work really well: when they can be a collaboration between ""what we want to build / research"" and ""what the market will pay for"".  I don't think product managers defining kinds of analysis, deep topics, etc is terribly effective because even though they may be well versed in the field and even possibly ""subject matter experts"" - they're not actually experts in data science.  To be effective in a PM-led data science org  Ask ""why?"" a lot.   Enlightened teams build better products. Sometimes a PM will define a new product very tightly, because precision looks a lot like expertise. Asking ""Why are we building this? Tell me more about the pain we're trying to solve."" will give you both better insight into the decisions that are being made, and hopefully help you have a bit more direction over what's being built.   Don't push for detail if you don't need it  Product managers are in an odd position at most companies. They're expected to know how much of something will sell (and for what), how long it'll take to build, what the project risks are and what the competition is doing about it - all before it's built. We're constantly using our lifetime of experience to guess and we hope it goes pretty well. But if you push us for details - we're not going to have a better answer than you will (on your own work), so why do it? Team members I work well with often recognize that high-level detail is enough. I don't want to build you a task list any more than you want me to build you one.  Make sure your PM knows they can talk openly with you  Every PM knows the engineers on their team (or others) they can sit down with and talk about things they need to understand better without it compromising their effectiveness as a manager. We've all had that moment of asking someone ""Hey, can you walk me through how this works"" and the engineer scoffing (either directly or indirectly) that I should know it already. Similarly, we all have those folks we know we can admit our own ignorance to and can help us define things better. Being on good terms with the PM who defines your roadmap not only means you've got someone who you can safely and non-confrontationaly question on roadmap decisions, but it also means you're likely to be someone they take input from when building out that roadmap. This is a good place to be.  Accept that they have different information than you do  This is the hardest part about working in product management, and varies greatly depending on how transparent your company is or can be. Product managers typically fall into the circle in management where we know what's happening with the business before most of the rest of the company does. This isn't a benefit, in fact for me it's immensely frustrating. I might know the reasons why we're killing a product or shifting direction and it may have nothing to do with the team - but I can't talk about it yet because it's not been made public knowledge within the company. Roadmaps are often hedged against a combination of features that have nothing to do with what the team wants to build. When we can, we share it. When we're cagey about why things are happening, that's often because we know something we can't yet share. It sucks, because at best we're having to ask people to take on faith something we know the reasons for. Sometimes decisions are made because of financial or personnel restrictions you don't know about, or don't need to know about - so it isn't that it's ""secret"" it's that it relies on a bunch of financial knowledge that they don't want to spend time explaining.  Aside: Sorry for the delay. I asked and then had a work trip that took me from SF to the UK and this dropped off my radar. That's my bad.   Edit: Unfinished sentence."

I won't say that it's product managers in general but the director of product at my company clearly doesn't understand the potential value and impact of our data science team. This means that I have to spend an inordinate amount of time selling him and management on opportunities and cautiously explaining why the random report he's asking for is not worth the effort. Also data science is science so it's very open ended and exploratory, some experiments are successes but some are failures, I think leading a DS team requires an entrepreneurial sort of faith in your team that a few successes can 'pay' for the experiments that go nowhere.   Generally I try and build faith in our team by getting some small wins which will give us more leeway to set our own path.

On the product side, there's really not any tolerance for experiments or failure, and frankly, that's totally understandable when managing a team of engineers. But analysts and data scientists aren't really engineers in the traditional sense. So even for projects known to be exploratory, product is looking to 'box it in' and cap it at [insert some arbitrary number of days - usually 3 is the go-to]. It's counterproductive at best.  What sorts of wins have you had success with? How are you validating the fact they've been successful to your product team? Do you have any evangelists on the business side, perhaps?

Hopefully your list will give me a good reference to get my bearings. Also will likely have to start with really basic stuff here.   Your slides are great. Seems like most of what you refer to as pre-processing we deal with a lot in econometrics.

datascience,2wf23k,ajneo999,3,Thu Feb 19 10:39:17 2015 UTC,"Short answer: It depends on the job  Long answer: Given that you want to be a data scientist - one way to approach figure this out is to go out and gather data. What you can do is go and find 200-300 postings that are for data scientists. Then count how many times ""data warehousing"" comes up in the posting, if at all. Then you can have some summary statistics as well as an idea of which types of data science jobs ""data warehousing"" is something that is important for them.  Then as a bonus, you can write it up on a blog (if you do all of the above programmatically) and then submit it here. This will give you some street-cred for having done a project related to data science."

datascience,2wbbew,sporknumbergenerator,3,Wed Feb 18 14:37:18 2015 UTC,"Short answer:  It depends on your goal and what you want  Long answer:  One of the classes is VLSI Programming (Very-large-scale integration (VLSI) is the process of creating an integrated circuit (IC) by combining thousands of transistors into a single chip.) where as another class is Academic skills in English and then yet another is Physical aspects of digital security ... These are all over the place because as a department and a stream, the University needs and wants to make sure that as many possible goals are covered.  This is why these are part of the electives.  Looking at the ""mandatory courses"", they look reasonable enough. The key things to ask about any one of these classes are:   What does the syllabus cover What is the book or are the books What is the lab / homework / coding portion of the class Who is the professor Who is/are the Teaching Assistants If I take this class, what class am I not taking If I take this class, what class can I then take   Then, at a more meta level, before you even think about what classes to take, it's better (like in the short answer), to figure out where you actually want to get to.  If you want to do deep learning computer vision at a startup, it's going to be different than doing deep learning computer vision at facebook/google/ibm/microsoft/apple, and then it's going to be totally different from being a ""general"" data scientist at a non-tech-heavy industrial firm."

The courses you list are all in the 'free electives' part that covers the 'rest' of the electives that aren't part of the Data Science stream per se. The English course you an only take if you qualify (i.e. your English must be sufficiently horrible), for instance. I think the more important bit would be the mandatory ones (as you said) and the choice of stream electives.   So far I've been selecting courses based on what I think is fun, and on a variation of the list you outlined (using also my previous experience with the professors and friends' experiences with the courses). I'm not settled on where I really want to get to at all, I'm mostly hoping that I'll figure that out more as I touch on more subjects. What's more difficult to determine is whether there's anything missing from the offerings that would also be a fitting subject."

So - ""not settled on where I really want to get at all, and I'm mostly hoping that I'll figure it out...""  One way to start trying to figure it out is to put yourself in ""future you"" shoes when you are looking for data science work. You can go on anyone of these websites:   http://www.careerbuilder.com http://www.indeed.com https://www.linkedin.com http://careers.stackoverflow.com http://www.glassdoor.com   and look for data science positions. Then you can start reading through them to see if anything jumps out at you.  The goal here is not actually to find a data science job, it is to see if there is anything that interests you. If so, take a screenshot or save the web page and move on to the next job posting.  Make this a habit - for 5 minutes each day, go to each one and see what new data science job postings there are.  After a few weeks of this, you'll start to get a sense of what is out there, what types of things people are looking for, and what might possibly excite you.  Then you can start to figure out what subjects you want to learn more about and/or where you want to go from there.  The next step after you're doing this daily, is to start building a data science portfolio of data science projects. The idea here is to start doing ""data science"" - that is the whole start to finish process. This will help you understand different types of data, different types of methods, different types of tools, and more importantly different ways that the whole thing can blow up. Mistakes are the best teachers. :)  If you're interested in a good way to choose a project for your portfolio that is based on data, I've written about it here => http://getadatasciencejob.com/advice/how-to-choose-a-data-science-project-for-your-data-science-portfolio  Regarding determining whether there's anything missing from the offerings - you could try to talk to alumni of your program that are now in the industry and ask them what they wish had been covered in the program. Your profs / the alumni office should be able to help out here and you can get an unbiased view from those already in the field."
datascience,2wb30a,hypothesize_this,8,Wed Feb 18 13:05:09 2015 UTC,"People in general don't care about things outside of themselves. So for an 'elevator speech' / 'elevator pitch', make it about them.

That way you are using their words, their concepts, their worries, and their concerns to help them understand.  ----- An Example -----  My mom is a high-school teacher of history, social studies, and spanish.  Data she knows she generates / curates   student attendance in her classes student test scores in her classes student grades in her classes student homework scores in her classes student punctuality in her classes   Data she may or may not immediately think about   student attendance in other classes student test scores in other classes student grades in other classes student homework scores in other classes student punctuality in other classes student socio-economic variables student ""school-activity"" involvement student ""non-school-activity"" involvement   So a ""Data Scientist"" could tell her a short ""elevator speech"" about how she could help my mom to:   Model student grades to predict overall GPA for the year Segment / group / cluster student population into N key criteria and then figure out what those mean Use the key criteria to figure out how to help students who are falling behind Predict what students are going to fall behind Predict what students will do well with what teachers... Build a data visualization for the school Parent-Teacher committee / school board to make the data accessible Do a big project on data munging to get all the data into one easily accessible data source Do a big project on data cleaning... etc...

Then use statistical software to do your analysis (R, python, or even excel). Plus using something like R for exploratory analysis helps you visualize your data better with graphs and charts as opposed to SQL which is tables only."

datascience,2w7zc9,roptis,3,Tue Feb 17 23:09:05 2015 UTC,"Additionally, It depends on the volume of data you are working with. For instance, if you have a big database cluster from a vendor like Teradata or Oracle with hundreds or thousands of AMPs, and work with many millions or billions of rows, it can be very beneficial to do all possible in SQL. Then feed only the well summarized and shaped data into a Python/R routine for analysis or prediction.  When it comes to exploration, R(specifically open source R) can be great, but can easily run into memory limits, and or bandwidth constraints on getting the data from the database to your machine with large datasets. To get around these limitations, my current tool of choice is Tableau with a live connection to a table/view in DB. It can very quickly allow for charting, distribution analysis, and various summarization statistics while allowing the database to do the heavy lifting."

If your datasets are small and transient, and you only need to manipulate them in memory as part of your program, use Pandas. Pandas can be thought of as a DSL that extends Python's array type by adding a DataFrame object.   If your datasets are large (or potentially large) and persistent, do it in a proper SQL database. You will will have an easier time scaling up, and it opens the doors to functionality and performance optimizations you would not have had otherwise (e.g. indexing, query optimizations, nested queries, partitions, etc.).  If your datasets are small but persistent, use an in-between solution like SQLite."

datascience,2w5we9,srkiboy83,1 point,Tue Feb 17 07:07:36 2015 UTC,The machine learning course on coursera by Prof. Ng has a linear algebra review lecture series. Lectures about clustering are also available if I'm not mistaken.  But eigensystems are not part of it I think. If you knew at least some linear algebra you can grab a book an learn it. It's really not that hard.

datascience,2w66xm,wijagain,5,Tue Feb 17 07:21:46 2015 UTC,"Depends on what kind of data you have and what you want to use it for. It's really about choosing a database model (e.g., relational vs. document store) and then choosing a particular implementation (e.g., postgres vs mysql or mongodb vs couchdb).  You mentioned CSVs, so I assume you are working with columnar data. You also mentioned the data is ""small"" (which in this case I'll take to mean ""fits in memory"" and ""homogenous records""). So, unless you have an exotic use case, your best bet is probably a relational database.   Popular relational databases include sqlite, mysql, and postgres. Choosing between them depends largely on your operational requirements (what your application will be doing with your DB, what your expectations for data consistency and performance are). Local or on a server? One or multiple users? Fully ACID? Fully SQL compliant? High write/read ratio? Distributed? etc....  edit:   Here is a comparison of relational dbs: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/sqlite-vs-mysql-vs-postgresql-a-comparison-of-relational-database-management-systems  As one commentor mentions, key/value store is possible in postgres but not the others. I've never used postgres for key/value, but theoretically thats pretty awesome."

datascience,2w66xm,wijagain,3,Wed Feb 18 09:30:10 2015 UTC,"MongoDB was at the right time, right place with NoSQL solutions 5+ years ago.   Solid marketing, and initial ease of use made up for weak internals, zero security, lies on benchmarks, etc.   It's seriously called ""The MySQL of NoSQL Databases"" for this reason.  A few things to consider:   it's weak for analytics with poor reporting and sequential access performance its schemaless feature is an optimization of the writer's role at the expense of the readers.   Having dozens, hundreds or thousands of schemas within a MongoDB database is a nightmare for analytical data consumers. while it's easy to get MongoDB initially set up actually having it work well at scale - with working backups, a single schema, effective security, etc - is notoriously difficult."

Are you asking why is mongo popular at all? That is really more of a webdev question than a data science question. I don't know if mongodb is popular among data scientists, but I would doubt it.   The document store model is not really niche though. One possible use of document stores is unstructured data, which is a defining feature of ""big data"" and ""data science""."

Try to find the balance between the different types of students and have them work together so they can build a portfolio of projects that they can be proud of and have fun with.

datascience,2vv485,yggdrasilly,3,Sat Feb 14 13:07:48 2015 UTC,"There is no one size fits all term, but from what I see in the vendor world, the ETL term is now the ""cool term"" for the processes you run in the data prep pipeline. Yes, there is a database-y nuance -- the destination datastore for ETL tends to be a relational database or cube.    Data ingestion tends to be used more by Big Data, spark, hadoopy folks.  Data wrangling, munging, cleansing sound more informal, and tend to be used by hipster data analysts, but not exclusively. Data pre-processing is a catch-all generic term that covers everything. It's a correct and accurate term, but hipsters tend to avoid it because it sounds boring. It's usually found in algorithm descriptions, industry brochures, journal papers, etc.    At the end of the day, they all mean roughly the same thing, with nuances. You just have to pick the term that has  the right nuance that works for your audience.   This reminds me of a brilliant Quora post by Aleks Jakulin about the difference between ""machine learning"" and ""statistics"": http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-statistics-and-machine-learning/answer/Aleks-Jakulin   Machine Learning is AI people doing data analysis. Data Mining is database people doing data analysis. Applied Statistics is statisticians doing data analysis (mathematical statistics is mathematicians doing statistics, a meta-activity analogous to theoretical computer scientists investigating, say, PAC and convergence - which sometimes gets put into machine learning). Infographics is Graphic Designers doing data analysis. Data Journalism is Journalists doing data analysis. Econometrics is Economists doing data analysis (and here you can win a Nobel Prize). Psychometrics is Psychologists doing data analysis. Chemometrics and Cheminformatics are Chemists doing data analysis. Bioinformatics is Biologists doing data analysis."

Either way it doesn't matter--look at the job placement stats, talk to grads, and if they can't give you stats or access to past students don't enter the program.  Regarding the quality of education in these sorts of MS programs, I think it depends where you go. I meet PhDs I can run circles around, but also many who can run circles around me.

datascience,2vomul,ReformedPhysicist,4,Fri Feb 13 05:16:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the helpful post. I'm currently in grad school and I hope to become a data scientist, ideally once I graduate this summer (but more realistically it'll be an ""eventual"" goal to work towards).  I think the main issue now, especially for us wannabe data scientists, is whether a company would be willing to take us math/stats/compsci/etc. students and recent grads and take a chance on us. Clearly there are very rigorous requirements for a proper data scientist, much of which cannot be taught in a classroom, so it seems like the best way to actually become a data scientist is to gain some experience, leaving us in a catch-22 situation."
datascience,2vomul,Geckel,4,Fri Feb 13 01:26:50 2015 UTC,"Clearly there are very rigorous requirements for a proper data scientist   Maybe my experience is wildly atypical, but this kind of made me laugh :) My route was decidedly...different. PhD in 2010, worked in finance for 2 years, got laid off, moved to Austin and started working at startups.   At the end of the day, I'm not sure that I'm a prototypical data scientist, but I think that few people who do ""data science"" (whatever that means) are. When I hire data scientists, I want to know that they can answer questions. You don't have to be proficient in everything, because even I spend a fair amount of time on stack overflow. But you do have to be able to look at data and tell a story.   I also get the sense that people confuse ""data science"" (broadly speaking) with some platform or specific technology (which is what I assume you mean with ""rigorous requirements""). I saw Paco Nathan (look him up) at a conference here in Austin, and he said something like ""Chemistry isn't about test tubes"". Chemistry is about understanding the world at distances from an angstrom to a micron (ish). That sometimes requires test tubes. More often it requires intuition and curiosity--that's what makes a good chemist, not being really good at using test tubes. If you have to learn how to use a test tube, and you probably will, then do it.   So, if you find yourself in a Catch-22 like this, I think you need to try doing something that convinces people that you can solve problems and tell stories. We hired a guy who started a data science blog. Go fork some repo and commit to it (I know for a fact that twitter hires data scientists from people who commit to certain repos). Make sure you have some analytics on your resume, and that you can do stuff with Python and/or R, and that you know some SQL.   One final note: most companies (especially places like Facebook, Google and LinkedIn) do strong culture screens. We typically turn people down, not because they can't hack the job, but because they don't fit with the company culture--and we're a small company. This is an easy fix--you need to really understand the company where you're applying, and you need to be excited about that opportunity. And if you don't fit in, you don't fit in---that's ok."
datascience,2vomul,koobear,3,Fri Feb 13 06:35:08 2015 UTC,"I guess what I meant by ""rigorous requirements"" was:   A deep understanding of statistics. Many people say they know statistics when they really just know some hypothesis testing steps and get confused by basic concepts (which to be fair can be unintuitive) Proficiency in programming. I don't think the language usually matters, but sometimes you need someone who knows a compiled language like Java or C++ well, which is something even the most hardened statistician can trip up on. As for the actual programming itself, while I consider myself a proficient ""implementer"" (as in I'll take some mathematical algorithm and implement it in code that'll be both efficient and generalizable), I've never taken an actual computer science course and still have trouble with more lower level computer science concepts outside of algorithm implementation. I find that a lot of other people have an inverse problem--they have degrees in computer science but they have trouble writing, say, an optimization algorithm from scratch. Hacking and troubleshooting. I know a lot of developers and engineers high up on the corporate ladder who still can't diagnose and fix simple computer issues. And that's okay in some cases--they're specialists who are geared towards performing a small set of tasks accurately and efficiently. But I have a feeling that this won't fly in data science. A bunch of other stuff I'm neglecting.   In the end, I just feel that there's such a massive volume of things to know (or at least be familiar with) that unless you've either spent some time as a data scientist or working in a large variety technical fields, you'll always come up short. I've heard that there's no such thing as an ""entry level data scientist,"" which makes me think that maybe despite my degree and internship, I'll end up back in IT or something once I graduate."
datascience,2vomul,Geckel,3,Sat Feb 14 02:55:26 2015 UTC,"Ahh I see.  It all depends on what job you're applying for--you can't expect to get a senior level position out of school. I feel like you are reading a very thin slice of job postings to have this view.   And you're definitely wrong about ""entry level"" data scientists--look for job postings which require 0-3 years of experience. That's the definition of entry level--here's one from apple on linkedin. Typically the requirements will say ""MS/PhD in analytic field or commiserate industry experience""...for you, entry level.  Think of a job posting as a three-year old's letter to Santa. They want a pony, a diamond ring, a time machine and a dinosaur. That'd be nice, but they'll probably be happy with $30 worth of plastic, and possibly the boxes in which it was packaged.  In particular:   Deep understanding of statistics depends on the type of job, but typically means that you know enough about things like linear regression to be conversant and understand their limitations. Depending on where you're applying, proficiency in a programming language like C++ or Java shouldn't be necessary. Learn Python, and that should get you pretty far. Also, ""proficiency"" doesn't mean you're going to have to write 1000 lines of production ready code a day, it means you understand the general patterns and language structures. I took a (single) computer science course once, CS 1301. Then I forgot everything I learned and had to reteach myself C++ in grad school. That's how it typically works. Hacking/troubleshooting = solving problems as they arise. This is probably 80% of what you spend your time doing in grad school.   I think a lot of people decide ""I want to do data science"" without understanding what it really means, and then get confused/discouraged because their window into the field is a bunch of job postings that some HR person tagged on Monster, or (WORSE) some article written by someone who majored in English because they hated math. If you can tick most of the bullet points in the OP, you're probably as well-off as any other working data scientist when they were first employed."

Being able to put your data in the correct form can make all the difference in the world when it comes to accuracy and speed of analysis.   Adding to this, you need to know what methods are appropriate for the data. You need to have some understanding of theory-building and how it informs the research design process. This is a big problem I'm running into frequently with other analysts/data scientists in our company. I'm currently in the middle of untangling a giant mess of a project that was poorly designed -- the initial team seemed to just throw methods at the data to see what stuck.

To get the average of the first 500 eyepositions for all the trials in the above data frame (let's call it ""tidydata""), one only has to do this in R: (the %>% is the magrittr pipe operator, in case you're unfamiliar with it)  > library(dplyr) > tidydata %>%   filter(order <= 500) %>%   group_by(trialnum) %>%   summarize(avg_of_first_500 = mean(eyepositions))   The bad news: MATLAB doesn't really like this type of data because it doesn't have the same relational facilities that R has (yes, MATLAB has the join() function but... ). MATLAB's native data structure is the matrix type, and even its table is essentially a data structure designed around handling vectors, matrices and cells. I don't know what the rest of your dataset looks like, but my guess is your current setup probably already works fairly well in MATLAB. I don't see a compelling reason to make it ""tidy"" if you're going to be working in MATLAB primarily.

I think I'll leave the millisecond resolution data in matlab and just export columns with one value per trial to R. Especially since I also have a column with 25kHz resolution data. Thanks again."

datascience,2vkych,Noctambulist,2,Thu Feb 12 15:54:04 2015 UTC,"Hey there! I'm a hiring manager for a company that does a lot with machine learning, and can speak from experience about what I've seen in our industry.   Age/Degree level has got very very little to do with our internships. The cost is more but not that much more (its still intern pay). The biggest reasons I might pass on you would be:   1) Compliance. We can't have 'interns' that have been out of school for longer than a year, so unless you are in the middle of your program or just coming out, corporate policy prevents me from accepting you into a program. Since you describe yourself as already having the degree, I don't know how long ago you got it and that may be a dis-qualifier.   2) ""regular ol' summer internship."" Three month internships don't give enough time to get ramped up on a topic and contribute mean-fully in a way that provides utility to the student. Such interns usually get tedious grunt work with a healthy amount of shadowing rather than some real hands-on project work. This stuff would likely be a waste of your talents, so I'd be inclined to bring something like an undergrad or master's student into the 3 month project, and try to convince you come on with a longer term program if you are right out of school.  We get a lot of people who aren't typical ""data science"" guys, and honestly it doesn't matter: its an internship and we aren't expecting you to be an expert in our work anyway. All you have to prove is interest and desire to become an expert and start a career in the industry, and you will be fine. Anybody who comes in with ""well I don't know what I want to do, so I thought I'd explore this"" won't get the position regardless of what they studied. I'm not going to invest resources in a person who is going to switch gears and become a pig farmer next year anyway: the utility to me is the fact that I am actively investing in the future of our industry.  Some of the other commenters are saying you could probably just go straight to a salaried entry level position. Maybe, you could certainly look and see what happens. Entry level openings are hard to come by, and I would be suspicious of them anyway as few companies actually want people who aren't experienced. That's the whole point of the internship: to cross that bridge so that you are no longer inexperienced in industry."
datascience,2vkych,kokirijedi,1 point,Thu Feb 12 05:28:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the excellent reply. So you're saying I should definitely apply for an internship, but just not with your company? ;)  On a serious note, is it standard to not accept anyone who is out of school for more than a year? The picture that's being painted for me is that I'm extremely qualified, but there's just no way to cross over into the field because... I have too much experience? I won't do grunt work? I'd be very disappointed if that's true, because I'm quite passionate about doing data science -- I just don't know how to take those first steps into an opportunity that will build my experience."
datascience,2vkych,kokirijedi,1 point,Thu Feb 12 05:49:18 2015 UTC,"Our corporate policy is driven by legality: the state department is pretty particular about not abusing 'interns' as low paid workers (the program is supposed to have an education focus). The laws may be more lax for domestic interns, but we don't differentiate from a policy perspective.   I think you misunderstand my comment about grunt work. I'm not going to deny you an internship because I think you are too qualified for grunt work, I'm just going to pressure you into considering a longer term program, because honestly it really is a better experience for all parties involved.   Another thing to consider is that you aren't alone in this: every career fair we do we have dozens to hundreds of interns apply. Right now I'm looking at 3 post doctorate students in very similar positions as you. While I wouldn't deny you from the grunt work position, theres certainly somebody very excited to do a 6 month or 12 month program and we'll probably bring them on since they are more valuable to us."

My advice would be to spend some time thinking about your CV - it took a while for me to really get a balance between the technical physics jargon & emphasising relevant skills I had.

Just randomly apply, or did you have connections or know about the opportunity through some other way?  Right now, I feel like I have the qualifications, but I'm stuck in the middle of a desert with nowhere to go. I suppose at some point I'll starting sending applications to any tech company on SimplyHired that is looking for a data scientist, but I thought a summer internship would be better.

Do checkout insight and software carpentry, both of which were founded and are lead by people involved with academic physics.

datascience,2vkrip,EulerANDBernoulli,5,Wed Feb 11 20:56:03 2015 UTC,Stick with the degree.  Its tough to show competency in something like math without it.  Data science is a combination of overlapping competencies and Math fills one circle on the Venn Diagram.  Understanding how data actually appears in the real world and how to transform it into something you can analyze is another.   Having an ability to write computer code to link your data into your analysis fills out the last one.  The absolute best thing you could do is get an internship someplace.  Now is the time to be looking. Companies will be starting the process of looking for their interns in about a month.  Find a position that lets you fill in the other two circles.
datascience,2vkrip,ddttox,3,Wed Feb 11 21:15:35 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: not a data scientist. However, if you focus on your masters and find a job when you graduate, you will find you will have more free time to take up those side projects.

datascience,2vkrip,datacubist,3,Wed Feb 11 21:11:40 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar position a little over a year ago. I was working on my dissertation for my PhD in economics and my advisor was pushing me to finish my third paper along with clean up my first two. It was about that point I realized that I didn't enjoy academia and that I needed to find another route to pursue in regards to a career.   So, rather than finish a third paper and bolster my position to join the masses in the madness that is the Economic job market in academia, I spent a huge amount of my time learning R, SQL and how to mine data. I jumped into kaggle projects and read all of the material I could find. Honestly, those days I rarely took a day off (including weekends) and would stay up at the office for 12-14 hours.   In the end, I think I somewhat disappointed my advisor, but I found a job I enjoy at a very good company doing extremely interesting projects. I was a little lucky, honestly, in that my company has their own data mining challenge that I did very well at which prompted an interview. The vast majority of companies do not (which should change!) and thus I only had 1 other interview of the 77 places I applied to."
datascience,2vkrip,fitnessdl,4,Wed Feb 11 21:17:55 2015 UTC,Your comment baffles me. I keep hearing that there is a huge demand for data scientists so where are all the jobs? Why are companies not hiring??
datascience,2vkrip,ddttox,3,Wed Feb 11 23:12:10 2015 UTC,"I think the demand has been hyped a bit in the press.  Compared to say, Oracle DBA, there isn't much demand.  The hype comes from the fact that even though there is relatively small demand there is also a very small supply of qualified people.  The other thing to keep in mind is that in data science you specialize in an area like stats, machine learning, natural language processing, graph analytics, etc and a particular data science job may require skill sets you don't posses.  Think of it like surgeons.  Brain surgeons and heart surgeons are both surgeons but each work on very specific problems."

You appear to view potential model bias in a vacuum, as if we're adding bias to selection criteria when in reality we're likely replacing bias + large variance  with bias + lesser variance.  See decisions made by judges by time of day as an example or pretty much any of Daniel Kahneman's work.  Bias is unavoidable in ALL decision making (human or otherwise) outside of toy examples.  Obviously this isn't to say that since bias is unavoidable that we shouldn't be vigilant to mitigate specific unwanted biases."

datascience,2vg9bn,patrickSwayzeNU,2,Wed Feb 11 18:22:44 2015 UTC,"They're frightening because these biases can be amplified in larger ways than before. Not only can they be amplified, but pinpointing what those biases are and how you introduced them is difficult.  A classic example is Google's ads algorithm, which brought up more criminal records if you searched a black sounding name than if you searched a white sounding name.  Another example is Boston Street Bump. Using your smart phone's accelerometer to detect pot holes is a brilliant and cost efficient solution. But it excludes lower income communities where the average person cannot afford smart phones."

If you collect data that isn't representative of the population then the bias was introduced by the data collection, not the algorithm.  The same problem would exist regardless of whether the decision maker was human or not - the problem was not amplified nor obfuscated by the use of algorithms.  Seems to me like the Google ad problem is a bit blown out of proportion.  The professor's whole premise is that it's unfair for certain names to have ADVERTISEMENTS for background searches/whatever associated with them because someone might equate that with guilt.  Good god that's flimsy.  Additionally, she found that 80% of ""white"" names turned up ""crime suggestive"" ads compared to 92% of ""black"" names.  While the percentages are LOL high, wouldn't you expect the latter to be higher given per capita crime rates?  Bottom line for me - as we make more ""data driven"" decisions (whether human or algorithmic), and especially where much is at stake we have to be vigilant to make sure we mitigate bias introduced by the data collection or labeling method.  This is where the vast majority of the problem lies in the case of algorithms."

No. Ads which are clicked on are given higher precedence because clicks are a measure of quality. So the issue isn't whether or not African Americans commit higher levels of crimes, the issue is whether or not Americans give higher precedence to a black person committing a crime (I say black person instead of African American because a black immigrant is susceptible to racism in similar ways) than a white person committing a crime.

We score issues based on complexity, rather than time (wiki ""agile development"").  Our code base is stored in git, commit messages are tagged with JIRA IDs. JIRA is git-aware, so you can look up issues and then figure out what your thought process was with the commits.  trello is a new addition, we use it for hypothesis testing our product--i.e., this change was predicted to have this effect.

You added that ""jobs for mathematicians are becoming scarce"" - I don't see any mention of that idea in the letter. Frankly, I don't know of any mathematicians (which you use to mean ""people who understand theory"") who can't code well enough to put together analysis scripts. If you understand the theory, implementing it is never a big deal...and, more likely, you can just end up calling some function from a library instead - that's just downright trivial. What matters is knowing what kind of analysis to apply when and how to potentially modify it for the task at hand.  I'm currently a data scientist and am involved in the data scientist interview process where I work. And I can tell you, while we do have a coding interview, only 1 out of 5 interviews looks for coding proficiency, all others evaluate theoretical knowledge of machine learning algorithms, probability, statistics, optimization and general modeling approaches to a problem.

I try to set it up so that it's a huge feature space and they have to regularize, then I ask them what some common regularization penalties are (I'm just looking for l1 and l2 losses here) and then ask them which which one is used in what context and why they work that way? Also 9 times out of 10 people will say let's use logistic regression, so I'll check to see if they're familiar with GLMs more generally and iterative weighted least squares to fit them.  Some other folks ask other questions...Stats 101 stuff - power of a hypothesis test and sample size, basic probability questions, basic stream computation questions (like keep a running mean and standard deviation of a stream of numbers).

I want to add some signal to the noise.  I happen to be hiring for a Data Scientist or two as of this writing, and was thinking of doing a blog post on offering advice for those looking. But then I thought of something better and more insightful: It is a cut-and-paste of an email that I sent to our Director of Talent Acquisition last week when he asked me, “Can you share with me what you’re looking for in regards to your Data Scientist candidates?”  Here it is:  Date: Mon, 26 Jan 2015 14:39:10 -0800   Delivered-To: XXXX@ziprecruiter.com Subject: Re: Sorry for the mix up regarding Data Science candidates From: Andrew Parker XXXX@ziprecruiter.com To: Ron Miguel XXXX@ziprecruiter.com Cc: Nicole Prause XXXX@ziprecruiter.com  –001a113a9c2e9685c2050d95cea1 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8  Hi Ron,  Thanks for all your help on this. Nikky, please add your thoughts to this thread.  In general, for this Data Science position, the question is: Can this person teach us something, and do they bring to the table some core competency that is missing from the team? Are they senior enough to teach others when we hire more junior people in the near future?  If they are new PhDs: The thinking is that they’re probably smart, and really it’s a question of seeing if their interests and expectations are aligned with the actual projects we have to work on, and to gauge their willingness to learn the problem domain (SaaS business issues: LTV, Churn / Retention, etc.) and tools. Seeing extensive use of Python and R is most important. I want to get a sense that they were the “hacker” in their lab.  The nature of the data matters: specifically I like to see them deal with messy, noisy, incomplete, unstructured, human inputted or driven data. Examples are NLP and text processing, linguistic modeling, survey and clinical data, economic and sociology data, web scraped (or API) data from Twitter, facebook, etc. Less ideal is data that is highly structured, and precise or all theoretical.  If they are new Masters or BS graduates: Many of these resumes are over-inflated and key-word stuffed, and I really have to read between the lines to figure out what they’ve actually done. I find these the most difficult to read.  If they have industry experience: Anything applying analytical and data processing skills to problems relevant to ZipRecruiter where they were the lead developer is what we’re looking for. They have to be able to deal with raw and mostly unstructured data. E.g. “Go look in this Apache access log file for what you need.” I am yet unable to accommodate candidates that are accustomed to an IT team doing all the cleaning and curation of data.  On-site: I’d like to have them present something and do a deep-dive on the data, analysis, code, and insights. I think recent graduates and academics will have a huge advantage since they are likely working with data and code they can share publicly. So the on-site visit will be different from the usual software engineering visit. Maybe for those that don’t have data handy that they can talk about, Nikky and I will have to identify some data for them to do a sort of “take home project.” We haven’t gotten to that point yet though.  Candidate work-flow: We’ll wait for your process guidelines, but in the mean time we’ll score candidates and make more detailed internal notes.  Thanks! -Andrew   And that’s it.  Keep in mind that this is for a senior position and describes my team’s particular needs at this point in time. I sent this email well before I contemplated writing a blog post. I hope some of you find this helpful.  If you’re curious, we still have that open Data Scientist position here: https://www.ziprecruiter.com/jobs/ziprecruiter-bf882208/data-scientist-db7104a3"

datascience,2v1t9v,pwang99,3,Sun Feb 8 09:04:14 2015 UTC,"OK, you don't really have a database, because that implies an ability to query across tables and a system that can automatically join/pivot/filter/group those tables based on your query. You cannot do that in Excel, and even if you could whip out a bunch of VBA, you really don't want to be doing this in Excel, period.  What you have is a data store.  Instead, you should look at writing a simple Python script which will convert these into some kind of semi-structured storage, depending on the type of data you have.  From there, Python should provide access to all the querying and modeling capability you need.  If the data in each table is very structured and the columns are the same for all 3000 sheets, you should use Python to dump them out to CSV or something, and then you can extract columns and do group-by etc. with Pandas.  Depending on the total size of the spreadsheets (i.e. if they are larger than the total amount of memory of your machine), then you might need to do somewhat more sophisticated techniques.  If the 3000 spreadsheets all have varying column types and whatnot, you might also want to look at a document-oriented NoSQL database like MongoDB.  Python can easily talk to that, too, and then query to pull out individual columns for correlation analysis and modeling."

How I did it: I moved to Vancouver after grad school and worked at a financial software company (basically mid-office in an IB credit team). I got laid off, couldn't find a job I wanted in finance, and faced a...err...one-third life crisis.  So I sat down and took a month to write down what I really wanted to do, and what I was really passionate about. I went into physics, I realized, because I liked to develop a good qualitative and then rigorous quantitative understanding of how things worked, and then to predict how they'd behave in the future. Basically, I liked to solve problems with numbers and answer interesting questions. It turns out that, after using this mission statement as the basis for a week of google searches, there were lots of people who'd pay me to do this, and a bunch of other people who basically did the same thing, called data scientists.  Once I discovered that, it was actually kind of a breeze. I moved to Austin and started sending cover letters and resumes blindly to startups with pretty much the above text exactly. Within three weeks of getting in to town I had something like 4 interviews.   What I do now: a little bit of everything. I work for a startup that delivers business intelligence for a few very large clients. Projects involve understanding our clients' business and designing a metrics program to help them improve it, then finding and integrating the data into our production processes.  I also do a bit of product development work--I designed a monitoring system that sits on top of our DW and alerts business owners to changes/trends/patterns in their key metrics. That was kind of a side project that was integrated into our product offering, which I think is pretty cool.  Aside from that, I also am the engagement metrics owner for our (web based) tool. I'm in charge of measuring how people are interacting with our tools, which is also pretty cool. This means building reports, sending updates to the company, working with the dev team to design instrumentation, and working with the product team to develop/test product hypotheses. Also pretty cool, IMO."

I tinker with lots of language and read a lot about both without the extensive experiences.  From what I've read, R is better off for small subset of data and prototyping. If you really need the speed go for Python eventually. Kaggle, most teams do Python and optimize 10% of their code to C, there was a kaggle blog article on it.  I guess in general you won't really know if Python or R is going to ""win"". Mind as well pick one and learn the other later on, acquire your data science skill, which is the fundamental skill set you should have and move on to learning different technologies such as programming languages.  If you're people stuck with picking or bickering about which language when there is just 2 then you're they're kinda crazy. I've done more than 5 languages.

I used it a lot last year at work and now I am using the skills and concepts I learnt and converting the code to python pandas so it is more maintainable by my other team members and I don't regret starting with R at all.

SPSS and Excel are good tools, but for a lot of data science-y data analysis jobs, employers prefer R or SAS (maybe Python). I would focus on R, because it's the easiest way to go from zero to useful. I wrote a blog post about this exact thing: How do I get my first job in data science?.

I took the advice and immediately sorted out a Meetup account for myself. I was honestly surprised to see so many people in the area who were interested in the same thing as me--so that's a good sign (I think).  I've been hearing a lot about R in the LinkedIn groups I am a part of, so I will check that out right away. Since I am simply swimming in free time right now (not really as ideal as it sounds), I can dedicate massive amounts of time into learning the software.  Real quick: what would be some good key terms to use in looking for some entry level positions? I'm honestly stumped. I've basically been searching things like ""entry level data analysis"" and variations thereof. Are there other, industry-specific, words to integrate into my search?

Some of it should be on your own: take some stats courses on Coursera, Khan Academy, and MIT courseware, then move into R rather than SPSS as your statistical programming language of choice.

This same teacher also integrated the full shebang of testing, research, analysis, and presenting while learning the subject in each of his other classes.

I also had experience with psychological testing during my time as an undergrad research assistant. That said, so far none of my experience has translated well into the job search world.

Within that analysis domain there will be many algorithms to choose from, and the best choice will depend on your use case, data, and technical environment.   The most important trade off I run into in my day to day work is the trade off between accuracy and interpretability, and that is also described in the diagram to some extent. Some cases require high accuracy and don't require interpretability. For example, if you want to predict some stock prices for trading purposes. On the other hand, some cases require the opposite, like understanding what makes an effective marketing campaign.  Technical environment is another requirement to consider entirely. Can the data fit in memory, if not, does the algorithm have a good distributed implementation yet, etc."

If you need an example, look into how much perl/cobol programmers are getting paid right now (there are more systems in the wild right now that don't have perl programmers because no one knows perl). Personally, I make its very clear to HR and managers that I'm interested in negotiating salary by immediately saying as soon as they specify an offer timetable, asking to schedule time to ""discuss the offer"" i.e., negotiate salary.

It invested in a group of R experts to try to find ways to integrate the power of R into its software. The R language isn't going to change. The complexity of the language isn't going to change. The talk about ""democratizing R"" doesn't really make sense. If you don't understand what is going on under the hood then you aren't going to understand whats going on when something goes wrong and even worse you aren't going to be able to figure out when something isn't right. Microsoft might build a better R IDE (I like R Studio, but I'm open the the idea of improvements), Microsoft may make a point and click interface to load data into R or connect R to SQL Server or their Azure stacks. They may even try to create a point and click wrapper for R (a la SPSS) but this isn't going to make stats, programming, predictive modeling, or machine learning any easier. This isn't going to create a 100.000 new data scientists. Like it or not, everything related to R, data science, and ML is incredibly complex (you can learn the basics quickly but to move beyond can be brutal).

There is a great book called ""Python for Data Analysis"" which I found to be quite a fun read, although it assumes you already know the basics of the language, so you might want to start out with tutorials and doing basic projects first.  The anaconda python stack comes with all the libraries you need for data analysis work (well, not really, but you're just learning the ropes and dabbling it totally does).  You will also need to learn SQL as that is how all the 'big data' is stored.  TBH if you're just looking to communicate w/ them, then statistics is the most important language for that, followed by SQL (so you can pull your own data and double check things), and being pro-active about asking the right questions. Part of a data scientists job is to be able to explain their results to others, but a solid understanding of statistics is definitely mandatory."

I'm an ex-mechanical engineer that's dipping into data science, and for what it's worth, it's never too late to switch!  I'm sure that you've done your research already, but here are some MOOCs and online resources that I found absolutely fundamental to my learning.  These are hard, but as I'm sure you've learned from your stint with Mech-E, the best way to learn (and learn HOW to learn and HOW to think critically), is to get your ass kicked and bang your head into a wall until you tackle the challenge.   Learn Python and R using MOOCs and other online resources.    The Analytics Edge (MITx) Data Science Specialization (Johns Hopkins) Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python (MITx) Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science (MITx) Learn Python the Hard Way Data Analyst Nanodegree (Udacity) -- I think you can get the videos/lectures for free, but the paid route runs $200/month.   I'm not entirely sure what the best route is to do a B.S., but I think your head is in the right place.  I think that if you crush any of the previously mentioned courses and pick up a few certificates, it would look extremely favorably to any admissions committee.  MOOCs have horrible retention and completion rates, so following through would prove it to them (and to you), that you have what it takes.  Here are some M.S. programs or equivalents worth considering (mostly online), although many are popping up.   Complete a Masters in Data Science (probably online)    Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS) through U.C. Berkeley - $60k Master of Computer Science (OMCS) through Georgia Tech with a specialization in Machine Learning - $7k Zipfian Academy (Data Science ""Boot Camp"") - $16k The Data Incubator (Boot Camp) - I think it's free if you're admitted?

It is extremely flexible and you can choose whichever courses align with your interests (as long as your mentoring professor agrees to them). Here are some of the courses I have taken and I think they would align with your interests as well: Machine Learning, Big Data, Information Retrieval and Advanced Topics in Machine Learning. The big data course was especially fun as we got a hands-on project with spark and a free $300 access to amazon's distributed computing to test our ideas!"

Expect to work full-time (and extra) on your study if you want to succeed. Nevertheless, I would still recommend it. The people, the work, the environment, everything together makes for a great experience!  With regards to the living costs: It is definitely an expensive city but it is not impossible to live a frugal lifestyle over here. Everything included (rent, electricity, water, public transport, groceries, etc, etc) I am currently spending about 1000 - 1100 CHF (= EUR) per month. It's possible to go even cheaper if you get lucky with a room with cheap rent.

I really didn't have an insight in the costs for zurich, apart from the estimation given in the site (https://www.ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/welcome-center/services-and-downloads/cost-of-living.html), so I'm very happy to see that you're living at a relatively low-cost life.

datascience,2tttp5,slashcom,1 point,Tue Jan 27 17:26:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the cost-of-living from the ETH website is a good estimate if you live a lavish lifestyle ;)  For example the 250 CHF per month on clothes, shoes, hairdressing, leisure activities, etc is completely off the charts in my opinion... Health insurance is stated at 300 CHF per month, which is a good estimate if you need Swiss health insurance. However, if you are from a European Union country and you have health insurance in  your home country, you can get a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) and save yourselves a lot of money here in Switzerland. You should ask your health insurance provider for more info on this.  For accomodation: look early! My semester started in September and I started looking for a room in July and that felt late... I was very lucky to find a room within a week! There's several local websites where you can apply for viewings: wgzimmer.ch, woko.ch and ETH housing office. I had most success with ETH's housing office and got few replies on the other websites... Some even have waiting lists... It's best to book a stay at a local hostel here in Zürich to give yourselves plenty of time for viewings. If you are from outside Europe (USA, Asia, etc.) the university usually has several temporary (single-semester) rooms reserved for those students, but you really have to apply early for those (first come, first serve)."

datascience,2tsrhq,RedOrange6,2,Tue Jan 27 03:05:20 2015 UTC,"I work in the public sector, so please understand that my answers might be different from my corporate peers.  1.Skepticism - You need to be the biggest critic of your own methods and results. You're going to be spending the most time with the data (and thus become its expert) out of entire gigantic institutions.... and people are going to trust your judgement.  If you're wrong and make grandiose claims, you're going to get yourself and a lot of other people in trouble.    Clear Communicator - In my job, I am surrounded by people who have zero quantitative skills.  I have to distill extremely complex information into publicly digestible sentences.  My writing has to be clear, concise, and truthful.  Moreover, I have to be able to orally communicate everything too.  Your analysis is useless if people can't understand it.  Humble but confident - There is always the Day of Reckoning where someone may directly or indirectly call you out.  When that Day comes, you have to be confident enough that you did everything as best as you could (because you're the biggest critic -- see #1) but also humble enough to admit you may be wrong. Statistics can be an extremely ambiguous discipline... so when your answers are realistically ""maybe"" someone may have their own (usually unqualified) interpretation of your analysis.  It's up to you to tell them ""Well, that could be right, but it could be wrong.""  Many people in our profession are known for answering questions with a ""Well, yes and no....."" because so many results are ambiguous.  2.Whatever you do, make sure you do something quantitative. I personally started in political science (don't recommend for data science -- but made my writing and analytic skills amazing) and eventually jumped into doing epidemiology (emphasis on biostatistics) for my second masters.  Bear in mind that someone described data science like this: ""You're a programmer/coder who can do some statistics, or you're a statistician who can do some programming/coding.""  I would fall into the latter category (which is where I think you would fall if you pursued data science, according to you not wanting to be 100% a coding monkey)... but I imagine a lot of people on reddit fall into the former category.  3.Not sure. Keep your options open.  You're still only 16.  Financially, sure it makes sense. However, I'm still a firm believer that it's stupid to major in something that you aren't 100% passionate about.  Markets change.  Skills get replaced and become obsolete. There are plenty of other extremely marketable skills that you could learn and probably be more passionate about if coding doesn't seem too appealing.    As a side note, you should also recognize that a lot of highly respected 'quants' (like Nate Silver) scoff at the term ""data scientist"" because they say it's just a sexed-up and hipper term for statistician.  (statisticians have always done what the data scientist does: take data and turn it into interpretable information)"
datascience,2tsrhq,palbrcht,2,Tue Jan 27 05:16:31 2015 UTC,"If you don't want to take the CS path a strong background in mathematics is more than recommended. Majoring in a field such as Statistics should prepare you well for a career in Data Science. Mind you Data Science is a very new field and will most likely go though significant changes, but having strong mathematical background will help you in any STEM field you might wish to pursue. Many say that Data Science jobs won't be as common in 5 years. That this is another bubble, fad or whatever. The truth is, no one really knows. The tech industry changes fast and people in IT must adapt and grow with it or lose their jobs. It will always involve a great deal of self learning, but if you are like minded this is a big plus for many of us.   As you are in high school I would focus on getting the best background in mathematics possible, in any classes that are offered to you."
datascience,2tsrhq,alexgmcm,2,Tue Jan 27 09:05:49 2015 UTC,"One bit of advice would be major in Computer Science.   I major'ed in Physics and unless you are willing to spend 4-7 years in Graduate School (for a PhD) on poverty wages for a very slim shot at academia it's very hard to get jobs with a Master's in Physics.  I actually went back to grad school and got a second master's in Informatics and now I'm applying for jobs with actually a hope of getting them.  But as others have said make sure you keep your mathematics up to scratch - you have to know algebra, calculus, linear algebra, statistics and probability theory.  Obviously it's possible to be successful with any major - but CS really is the path of least resistance at the moment."

While I do agree that strong coding skills are important, I don't think majoring in computer science is a good choice for a career in data science. To me, you'd just look like any other entry level software engineer. From a hiring perspective I'd prefer a Math/Stats oriented major with some coding to a CS major."

Though I would argue that no one expects you to be a master of anything after graduation and that subject mastery is only expected later in your career.  I do agree that it is a disadvantage in the sense of, am I the best coder? No. The best data scientist? No. But I tend to work for places that can only afford 1 person for those 2 roles aka startups :)"

This might be crazy, but I would consider a major in some stats-heavy domain science (psychology or sociology?) with a math minor.  I'm personally wary of anything as ""hip"" as data science is right now. It's very hard to predict whether the demand for data scientists will continue to grow. What's not hard to predict is that there will be a lot of trained data scientists in the job market in 3-5 years. Honestly, it's conceivable that you're too young to catch this wave, but it's truly difficult to tell.    Random pontifications:  I second the suggestion to get involved in Kaggle competitions. It'll get you coding and familiar with the methods/software and let you know if it's something you'd enjoy.

However, a few big things I had to pick up while I was here:   SQL. This is probably number one on my list.  Any flavor is fine, though my coworker got me started on postgresql working on a local database. If you are working with python, learn pandas.  Its great for time series and munging tables sql like in memory in python, and pumping out quick descriptives and plots.  Familiarize yourself with a lot of the common machine learning models, including k-means, regressions, PCA, rec sys, and any others you come across.  The 2 best sources I've used are Andrew Ng's machine learning class on coursera (which uses matlab) and the book machine learning in action (which goes over implementing some of these models in python.  The statsmodels and scikitlearn libraries for python are also great for implementing these in python  Dive in more to the stats.  My stats background in college was basically quantum, thermal, and statmech, which does not nearly cover the range of stats required (in my opinion).  Brushing up on a real stats class would be helpful, especially when analyzing your models after they have been fitted.   There is also an O'Reilly book I heard is good called 'Doing Data Science', so I would try and give that a look as well.  Edit: While it seems like there is a lot missing, the math and physics background is a great jumping off point that should do great on resumes.  From my personal experience, my boss was looking for anyone with the right background who could learn data science.  He hired two physicists (MS and PHD) and a math Phd.  That being said, usually some kind of masters degree is recommended (I know that was a requirement for my position.)  So working a 2 year masters program may not be a bad idea."

datascience,2tq2bo,pm8k,4,Tue Jan 27 15:34:21 2015 UTC,"So there are a number of fellowships for people transitioning from the sciences into data, but most of them are tailored towards people with advanced degrees (master's or PhDs). You can always check 'em out: Insight, Data Science for Social Good and the Data Incubator are three that I know of. Data Science for Social Good accepts applications from undergraduates; I don't know about the others, but I don't think so. I think all of these are either free or provide a stipend for fellows.      Other than that, you can look into boot camps of various sorts. From what I gather, a lot of these are really good just for hooking you up with employers alone, not even considering the educational aspect (which I am sure can be very good). Boot camps have somewhat of a dodgy reputation in computer science generally, but my impression is that they're considered a half-decent way of breaking into data science. Most (all?) boot camps charge a considerable tuition fee, but given how hot the market is right now, that is probably a worthwhile investment.      You can do a master's degree if you want. In fact, there are lots of advanced data science degrees that are emerging now, which is something you might find interesting. This is obviously a much more comprehensive investment than a bootcamp, costs more and takes longer. I wouldn't be surprised if companies are lining up to scoop up these graduates.      There are lots of ways of going about this; probably many other ways than I have covered here. You don't even have to fork up money if you're happy just learning on your own, writing blog posts, participating in Kaggle competitions, etc. The idea behind this is to build a portfolio to show to employers that demonstrate that you can handle their data science needs. I would imagine that this is much harder route than doing a fellowship or a bootcamp, however.  Edit: Fixed some typos and formatting"

datascience,2tp93v,spalunk,2,Mon Jan 26 13:33:02 2015 UTC,"Impressions so far: As someone with limited formal education in data analysis, they do a good job of condensing topics into short segments, and do a particularly good job in terms of tools and best practice. The highlights so far have been R Programming, Reproducible Research, and in general their preference for using Git and Github to work on assignments.   What I don't like has been the teaching quality. It ranges from pretty decent (Roger/Jeff) to not so good (Brian). Like I said, the tools and best practice components are great, and the whole idea of the specialization as a way to either 1) get people started in data analysis, or 2) introduce data analysts to R, is great. They just need to shore up the execution. As an example, Brian's explanation of the Central Limit Theorem is one of the worst I've seen. I almost feel like just reading Naked Statistics would get you further than Statistical Inference if you don't have a strong statistics background.   Also note that this specialization is more data analysis than data science. Not a bad thing, just a branding issue. You won't be working with large data sets, or with databases in the class (beyond very superficial treatments), BUT, to their credit, you WILL be working with messy data sets. And for that, I have to give them a lot of credit, because many data analysis classes give you a cleaned data set, and then ask you to perform analysis, whereas there are many cases here where you will be expected to clean the data in R before analyzing it.   Should you take the first class now: As others have said, yes. If you have programming and data analysis experience, the first few classes should be easy. If you have R experience, even better.  I'm on the last half of the specialization, and I'm struggling as to whether or not to finish it. I think I am going to pause and take Andrew Ng' machine learning class, and possibly the Introduction to Statistical Learning class, before proceeding. I have heard excellent things about these courses. They may be worth checking out!"

I come from a different field that's very analysis centric, and am looking into this to see what techniques other data driven fields are using.  What would you like to see added to the course to make it more 'data science' rather than data analysis-centric?     edit: The machine learning class is a good one.  Some of the lectures are best watched on 2x speed, but others were very useful and a rare combination of clear and thorough."
datascience,2tp93v,emeri1md,1 point,Mon Jan 26 22:01:34 2015 UTC,"Andrew Ng's ML class is top notch. He teaches it in Octave, which is probably more similar to MATLAB, and in some ways, R (index 1).

Round 2 is a programming/stats problem set based on the skills that you endorsed. They email you with a link to your problem set about 3 days before it's due. I'd recommend that you have a well thought out plan for what project you'd work on while there, as that was part of the later stage of the application. Kudos to you for just going ahead and applying. I'm a PhD candidate in neuroscience and use a lot of programming and stats, but have little formal training in either.

I am working full time too and didn't have the time to commit to GMAT or writing letters and getting references - the Harvard course has a good model of anyone can sign up, if you pass you get the cert if you don't you don't get the cert.

As someone who has done an AMA, promoted my work (data science weekly), and not promoted some of my other work in the data science space - my feelings are as follows:   Self-promotion is okay if spaced out. I co-run a weekly newsletter, but post it here infrequently as this is a small sub-reddit, so I don't want to crowd the front page with weekly posts about it. The group decides what belongs in this group. The way I monitor my posts, is that if anything gets a 0 then I stay away from that topic. I learn and hope others learn as well. The group should ban people that don't learn. If you look at the history of /u/urinec, /u/vincentg64, and /u/livanalonso. They are all Vincent G from data science central. He even signs them - Vincent. The other thing to notice is that most of the data science central posts have a big 0. So not only our group, but others (machine learning, big data, text mining, etc) have found this content and this poster(s) to be outside of the scope of what they want to be present in their community. Posts from companies are questionable and should be held to stricter ""rules"". /u/SIGMAmarketing being a good example here. They have 1 post. It has a score of 0. Should they post again or comment, I would hope that it would something other than a self-promotional post. We are here to learn, help each other learn, and support one another. /u/chrisalbon is a great example of someone we can all learn from and who contributes back to the community. We would be hard pressed to find someone whom the larger community thinks that /u/chrisalbon is a detraction to the community.

datascience,2t7ozg,maxToTheJ,1 point,Thu Jan 22 07:44:30 2015 UTC,"Self-similarity:       In mathematics, a self-similar object is exactly or approximately similar to a part of itself (i.e. the whole has the same shape as one or more of the parts). Many objects in the real world, such as coastlines, are statistically self-similar: parts of them show the same statistical properties at many scales.  Self-similarity is a typical property of fractals. Scale invariance is an exact form of self-similarity where at any magnification there is a smaller piece of the object that is similar to the whole. For instance, a side of the Koch snowflake is both symmetrical and scale-invariant; it can be continually magnified 3x without changing shape. The non-trivial similarity evident in fractals is distinguished by their fine structure, or detail on arbitrarily small scales. As a counterexample, whereas any portion of a straight line may resemble the whole, further detail is not revealed.

datascience,2t1ur5,sng0691,3,Tue Jan 20 20:39:49 2015 UTC,"I think R is easier to learn, but Python is better for things that aren't strictly statistics/data analysis/machine learning, and as a data scientist you're going to have to do that inevitably."
datascience,2t1ur5,poopyheadthrowaway,3,Tue Jan 20 21:34:03 2015 UTC,I think Python is easier when you are learning it for the sake of learning programming i.e. When you try to learn a tool for a specific purpose (i.e. data analysis) I think you tend to skip important things because you want to get to what interests you quickly

Python has simpler syntax, better base performance w/pandas, and imo much simpler functionality with web inputs/outputs than R. All and all, they both have their nuance with subsetting and indexing. Call me crazy, but I like python so much I use pyper/rpy2 when i need statistical packages from R. The only thing I miss is the full glory of ggplot and its flexibility."

Let's assume you have 2 years left of college before you go looking for full time work. That means you have lots and lots of time to experiment and learn not only material, but also what blows your hair back.  I would suggest that rather than looking at companies, that you start looking at people and finding people you would want to work with this upcoming summer as well as in the future.  The field is evolving quickly so rather than looking at companies and groups, you want to start following the people who are doing the actual data science.  Here are a few lists:   https://twitter.com/InsightDataSci/following (Insight is a data science fellowship / bootcamp. This list is the people whom they follow.) http://www.insightdatascience.com/fellows.html (This is a list of PhD/PostDoc people who have gone through the Insight program who are now working as data scientists somewhere) http://giladlotan.com/2012/11/mapping-twitters-python-data-science-communities/ (Though a bit older 2012, this is a list and analysis of data scientists and their communities)   So find some people on there, figure out if their work appeals to you, and write them a short email with what you basically posted above. That you are a sophomore in college, that you are looking for a data science / data visualization internship, and that you'd love to to hear thoughts on how they think you should approach the problem.  This will do a few things   Get you in touch with real life data scientist It will force you to really consider what you are interested in It will enable you to start following their blogs/twitter/github etc to see what things / topics they are talking about and what is contemporary It will force you to write emails It will force you to start to build a very basic network of people in the field.   Good luck!"

datascience,2t2xic,seabass,2,Wed Jan 21 03:40:09 2015 UTC,Data science is a HUGE field - unless you really want to do #bigdata or machine learning anything is better than nothing (even data analyst/vis work)
datascience,2t2xic,seabass,2,Wed Jan 21 05:30:18 2015 UTC,"Like /u/jexm said, the Data science field is HUGE - so the most important thing is to get started and figure out what you like and don't like. Even Data Visualization is a HUGE field and it depends on the tools and data sets you are using.  For instance - check out some data visualization tools available here => http://selection.datavisualization.ch/ . A ton, right? And that's not all of them. Even for a popular library like D3.js (http://d3js.org/), there are about 20-30 other libraries that sit on top of it.  So, the best advice is at this point is to look up all those people, figure out whether you are interested in it, and reach out to them.  Being qualified at this point doesn't matter because you are so young (relatively speaking of course). What matters is that you care about something and are willing to learn it. :)  Good luck!"

datascience,2t2nsx,dsocma,0,Thu Jan 22 00:52:25 2015 UTC,"trust me. While the refresher linear algebra courses are necessary, they are still an effort in discipline.  Still, I'd appreciate any feedback on the actual classes / classes that you'd recommend adding"
datascience,2t2nsx,dsocma,2,Thu Jan 22 01:58:43 2015 UTC,"My advice would be to start with whatever course seems most appropriate, do that all the way through, and do all the coding assignments ect, and then after you have completed that, then you will have a much better understanding of what you want to learn and what the next step is.  Then do the next one and so on.  Because there may be a lot of reduncency in the courses you chose, and while in theory it would be ideal to take every course as a self-learner (in order to make up for the lack of rigor compared to a formal education)-- the reality is, its much harder to motivate yourself as a self-learner, so doing one good course is better and more realistic than dabbling in 10."

datascience,2srxmb,mrDNA_1988,8,Sat Jan 17 22:42:33 2015 UTC,"One way to think about it is the following: how long you could leave someone alone to do a task without checking in.  Example  That is - let's say you have been tasked (by yourself or others) with building a predictive model that your company will rely on. It needs to be delivered in 6 months. It involves combining external and internal data sets, it involves putting the data sets together, it involves fact finding for requirements, it involves working with various other groups in the company, it involves working with the company's biggest customer, and it has to work.  Which comes back to how long would you let someone tackle this project without checking in.   Senior Data Scientist - You give it to them and they take care of it. No need to check in. Mid-level Data Scientist - You check in probably weekly or monthly but don't get involved too much. You also pair them with a Senior Data Scientist. Junior Data Scientist - You check in daily if not twice daily and you pair them with a mid-level and senior data scientist.   Which means  That maturity, specific skills, tool sets (industry and company specific), years of experience, education level, and everything else all matter equally. Because each one will have to come into play with all the various moving parts of the 6 month project.  It also means that though the definitions can be fluid from company to company, if you think about it in the above terms, it's relatively easy to place yourself or others. If the money is on the line, how comfortable / confident would you be leaving someone by themselves.  Why PhD's can get to senior level faster  Which then points to why PhD degrees are generally wanted by people hiring Data Scientists.   Doing a PhD, forces you to do all of the above mentioned work by yourself, so maturity is developed. PhD degrees are generally 4-6 years of hard research experience where the person has to be internally motivated and has to deliver results. No results delivered, no PhD degree given. So although they aren't a Data Scientist, they have 4-6 years experience driving projects by themselves. Doing a PhD (for almost 99%) of students, involves amazing amounts of failure and then being forced to figure it out. So a PhD student will be resourceful. Doing a PhD requires you to do something novel (no matter how insignificant it might seem to non-academics), the whole point of doing a PhD is novel research and novel results.   Gets Sh*t done  Last, but not least, the difference between junior, mid-level, and senior data scientist is how much knowledge / experience they have getting sh*t done. A junior person may come up to walls and not know how to get around them (either institutional, tools, methods, data, math, statiscs, ect). A mid-level person will be somewhat battle hardened and have a pretty good feel for how to get things done and what ""short-cuts"" to take and how to shoe-horn one method into another one. A senior data scientist gets things done. Period. That is what they do - they will get the project done come hell or high water. Whether that means hiring new people, bringing in consultants, contractors, researchers, academics - they know what needs to happen, they know how to make it happen, and they do in fact make it happen."

datascience,2srxmb,WallyMetropolis,6,Wed Jan 21 16:52:38 2015 UTC,"My current title is 'senior' and I never finished a PhD. I would say the real marker of a senior level is if you can take total ownership of a problem and deliver the right solution without guidance. This may involve some management responsibilities as the problem may be larger than one person can solve. It also means interacting with people outside of the technical teams. Perhaps directly with customers. It means you have experience building more general, reusable solutions. It's very rarely a marker of the depth of your knowledge of algorithms or math."
datascience,2srxmb,Ambivalent_Toaster,3,Sun Jan 18 00:36:10 2015 UTC,"When comparing across the entire industry, the terms are essentially meaningless. I have met principal data scientists who don't know a fraction of what I do, and juniors who I have learnt a lot from.  It might help you to distinguish between two people within the same company, but the industry has a long way to go towards standardisation before an industry-wide consensus emerges vis-a-vis lawyers or accountants.  This is compounded, of course, by the fact the fact that who a data scientist is, and what exactly he does for a living, will vary dramatically depending on who you ask. People on this subreddit might be able to give you a relatively coherent set of answers clustered around ""something something statistics something something programming something something machine learning"", but ask people out there in the corporate world and you'll find that everyone from the secretary who enters data into excel to the consultant winning Kaggle competitions is a data scientist."
datascience,2srxmb,Xgamer4,1 point,Mon Jan 19 19:35:27 2015 UTC,"A prior company I worked for had gave everyone on the ""Data Team"" (which is exactly what they called it) a job title like ""Data Specialist"" or ""Data Analyst"". My title was ""Data Analyst I"".   My primary responsibility was technical support for the product (mainly via email), and whatever else needed done (I also adminned Jira and wrote product requirements).   This is just a long-winded way to underscore the point about how the title isn't even remotely standardised."
datascience,2srxmb,apor,2,Mon Jan 19 20:46:44 2015 UTC,"I think there is the theory and the actual practice behind this.  I'll give you both.  The company I work for has the following levels.  Associate, Regular (e.g. Data Scientist with nothing preceding level in title), Senior, and Principal.  In theory.  Associate: 0 - 2 years of experience.  Works alone only on small and basic projects.  Works in team on bigger and more advanced projects.  Regular: 2 - 5 years of experience.  Can work on all types of projects on their own, but typically does not lead big and/or advanced projects.  Senior:  5 - 10 years of experience.  Typically can do most projects on own and leads projects.  Principal: 10+ years of experience.  Expert in field.  Takes lead on advanced projects, especially projects in new subjects areas (e.g. a statistical methods not used much in past, advanced math, etc).  PhD a big asset.   In practice.  With exception of people straight out of college, titles are somewhat arbitrary and indicate leverage person had during hiring process or existing employee (a good one) threatening to leave jobs.  Title is more indicative of how much salary is paid since level determines pay grade.  Examples:  We had a person who came in from a well known company.  To woo them they gave them a high level and probably paid them a ton.  After 12 months person still could not handle projects on their own - have better associates.  Another quirk is with people who want Green Cards.  My company is decent with this and so people will join as Associate and Regulars to skip some of the hell other companies do in the GC process.  IMHO my company really abuses this to pay them less and put them at a lower level.  This title also doesn't line up with areas of expertise.  Somebody could be an expert in Hadoop or a statistical method (e.g. boosting) and they'll lead principal and seniors on projects.  If you want to move up, changing jobs every 2 years is probably most effective strategy.  Staying at same company will only result in HR BS and not getting promoted unless you show a competing job offer."
datascience,2srxmb,caughtinthought,3,Sun Jan 18 18:13:09 2015 UTC,"I think years of experience is the major contributing factor. In general, not limited to Data Science, companies like to give their employees a progression (Junior -> Intermediate -> Senior) such that there is a sense of fulfilment and progress. Similar to, for example, the consulting world where employees go from Associate -> Consultant -> Partner or whatnot.  I'm sure level of education (eg. PhD) may fast track you, but I think these tiers are more designed around experience."

datascience,2slpsv,ribfeast,2,Fri Jan 16 05:54:45 2015 UTC,"Two rather crude ways to think about data sets in ""data science"" terms.   How can I use this data set to make myself/others money? How can I use this data set to save myself/others money?   I know - crude. Just hear me out.  What a data scientist is and does  ""Data Scientist"" is an industry term - that is, it's a term being used by companies to hire people to do data science. One of the bootcamps (Insight) describes a ""data scientist"" as follows:   one job of a data scientist is asking the right questions on any given dataset (whether large or small)...After finding interesting questions, the data scientist must be able to answer them!  (source)   So a data scientist, in hyper-simple terms, is someone who works for a company that asks the right questions and then answers them.  Which leads to the two crude questions  A for profit business at all times is either trying to make more money or cut costs. So as a data scientist with any given data set, you should be able to answer those questions or at least come up with ideas for how to approach those questions given any data set.  Training your brain  With this, you can now play the following game - given a data set:   A) How would you make someone money with it? B) How would you save someone money with it? C) What companies would be interested in this?   Examples  I opened up (from the sidebar) /r/datasets ... here are the first three data sets I saw   87th Academy Awards Dataset New Vegetation Climate Data Record Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten publishes raw data (logs, gps-traces etc) from cell phone surveillance finds in Oslo   So now ask yourself - given these data sets a) how can you make money from them and/or b) how could you save money from them?"

datascience,2slpsv,cherryblossomlass,1 point,Sat Jan 17 03:10:34 2015 UTC,"There are strong elements I agree with here. In particular:   So a data scientist, in hyper-simple terms, is someone who works for a company that asks the right questions and then answers them.   The monetization first approach is how many energy companies, ads teams, and consultants approach data science. I work a bit closer to consumer products and have the philosophy, 'build a product that helps people, then monetization will follow.'  For consumer products and insights creativity, three approaches come to mind:   The most inexplicable approach is instinct. Not much I can say here other than instinct strengthens with experience. The most rigorous approach is research. While we are dealing with new datasets in a Big Data world, sociologists have been collecting small versions for centuries. When I started studying user behavior, I read Jane Goodall's work on studying the behavior of gorillas. Her research covered complex aspects of how chance meetings lead to modifications of behavior, statistics for whether or not something was significant, methods of dealing with sparse data, and much more. When I started studying how people got jobs, I read Mark Granovetter's work. While these prior studies of course differ, they often end with, if we had more data, this is where we would go. A template for data products is to take the questions that were asked by sociologists and personalize or answer those questions for an individual's sphere of influence. My favorite approach is to ask everyone around me, what do you want to know? It's not uncommon to get so stuck in the data and forget questions like 'How do movie stars get their big breaks?' are of interest."

datascience,2sh0rv,seabass,4,Thu Jan 15 15:08:38 2015 UTC,"""entry level -> ????? -> senior data scientist"" seems to be your question.  It depends on what you want to do. There are two choices - expert in 1 thing OR ""expert in all the things"". Which is pretty much the choices you presented 1) become very skilled at one thing or 2) expand skillset to many other things some of which fall into other job descriptions - data visualizer / front end developer / data engineer etc.  breakdown of comments  If you look at the other comments listed here, you'll see that their responses make sense in terms of advocating either becoming an expert in 1 thing: ( /u/caughtinthought :: reading bishop and owning the math) or expanding your skillset ( /u/jexm :: python to scrape website, postgresql to store data, CRUD application framework to do web programming, front end JS technology to present data).  The tricky thing with the data science field is that ""Data Science"" means so many things, that you can find people who are Senior Data Scientists whose jobs entail either track.  what do you want to do  So one way to think about it is - what job do you want to do and what do you want to spend your time thinking and reading about. If algorithms, statistical models, and machine learning get your excited, then option #1 of your list is the way to go. If you get excited at the possibilities of doing what /u/jexm said in the comments below, then the option is #2.  data viz is growing as fast if not faster than data science  One last thing - you mentioned moving into the data visualization engineer path. This is a very very very hot area right now (like others) and there are tons of opportunities right now because data visualization is mostly how ""non-data scientists"" interact with data science groups. That is - reports / charts / dashboards / presentations / etc. The more there is a need for data scientists, the bigger the need for data visualizers.  If you have specific questions about ""Data visualization engineer"" career path - respond here and I can try to answer those as well.  edit: spelling"

The data engineer gathers and collects the data, stores it, does batch processing or real-time processing on it, and serves it via an API to a data scientist who can easily query it.    and    A good data engineer is has extensive knowledge on databases and best engineering practices. These include handling and logging errors, monitoring the system, building human-fault-tolerant pipelines, understanding what is necessary to scale up, addressing continuous integration, knowledge of database administration, maintaining data cleaning, and ensuring a deterministic pipeline.   So for me - these seem to have an equal projected growth if not more in the near future. Now that most every company has an idea that they need to get with the data program they want to go out and hire data people.  What data people find is that the company has terrible or no data infrastructure. So the data person then either has to build it, convince the companies other tech people to build it for them, or to hire a data engineer / data architect to build it.  Which would point to me that there is considerable growth in the area..."

I'd like to point out the following specific fallacies.   1) Statisticians are not data scientists and this has nothing to do with the fact that they ""don't know how to program,"" or because the field isn't up with the times or because they failed to capitalize on the latest buzzword. Statistics is not exactly data science for two primary reasons. One, statistics was originally designed for small data sets. This is absolutely necessary for clinical trials, but not so good for, say, machine translation. Two, statisticians have a poor habit of finding solutions to problems that don't exist. This is the antithesis of data science.  2) It is extremely unfortunate that so many people legitimately believe that sklearn is a legitimate solution to all of their data problems. I mean, it's a great package, but is it really best practice to rely on models that one does not understand?  3) For data science work that goes beyond traditional statistics into ML, this is not simply something that can be ""picked up on the job."" This shit is hard, y'all. I know this, because I do it for a living.  4) I have no idea why this idea of formal training is so important.

Especially the latter is very convenient in Python: All you need to do is to pickle our scikit-learn model, put it into a web framework (e.g., Python's Django or Flask) and dump it onto your web server.

If you dive into machine learning, support vectors, and blah blah too early you won't be able to properly route your data to the right analytic techniques.  Also learn sql and a scripting language really really well.      As far as methodology just google and read the wikipedia pages but approach them with an eye to understand the algorithm, rather than just implementation.  Agresti's book, an introduction to categorical data analysis, is exactly what you are looking for if you have the cash.  The older versions are just as good as the newer ones.    The big problem of diving right into a data science boot camp style training thing is that they teach you a little bit of everything when being able to understand a specific use case and route it to the correct algorithm is more important.  Data Science specific training can only make up for years of experience in every area by taking shortcuts to your core knowledge.  Its the statistical equivalent a script kiddie.

From this you can look up Ridge Regression and read about it at the 1000 foot view.  If that's not interesting, then go back one step which leads you to ""SGD Regressor"". From this look it up in google and read about it at the 1000 foot view. If that's interesting, dig in, otherwise go back one step...  The goal of this exercise is to find something somewhat similar enough to what you already know that it's just a bit of a stretch to learn something new.  And of course, like I started the post - start solving problems that you care about. Don't learn math, statistics, machine learning, or anything else for the sake of it.

Deeper Data:   Basketball games happen on specific days and have happened on specific days in the past, which means you know what window to look for The day after games, there will be lots of ""monday-quarterbacks"" discussing the game, that means you can look at the day after as well You can conceivably find the names (first, last, nicknames) and twitter handles of all the players in the league, so you can find out what words they use, when they use them, and how they use them You can conceivably find the names (full and abbreviation) of all the plays that are run in basketball You can conceivably find the names (full and abbreviation) of all the rules in basketball You can conceivably find the names (full and abbreviation) of all the referees in basketball You can conceivably find the names (full and abbreviation) of all the cities that have basketball teams You can conceivably find the names (full and abbreviation) of all the fanbases and what they call themselves (for instance, the American NFL seattle seahawks fanbase calls themselves the ""12th man"" (http://www.seahawks.com/12th-Man/) You can conceivably find the names (full and abbreviation) of all the moves that are done basketball (dunk) You can conceivably find the names (full and abbreviation) of all the fouls that can occur in basketball (double dribble, 3 second violation) You can conceivably find the names (full and abbreviation) of all the colleges, high schools, and feeder teams that place players into the NBA basketball (duke, NBADL, etc...)

Winnow it down to people how are active, don't look like spam, have tweeted recently Make a list of all the reporters who cover the NBA as their beat   From this you can then go and to the dictionary list again to see what words they use.

datascience,2ryi35,dtelad11,3,Sat Jan 10 14:06:31 2015 UTC,You can use it for higher dimensional embeddings if you want to use it for dimensionality reduction rather than just visualisation - I remember the original paper says that you need to change the parameter of the t-distribution as I think by default the t-distributions are too heavy-tailed for higher dimensions.  But the original paper explains what would be necessary to use it for higher dimensional embeddings - it should be fairly simple to implement it or to modify an existing implementation.

However, if you ever going to do data processing at scale, you will be using Linux underneath, so understanding how that works is an advantage.   OSX is really a good compromise since it is based on Unix like linux and many things transfer especially well from OSX to linux, but OSX has much better user interfaces for most things. This is likely why they made the suggestion.   I recommend accepting OSX as a recommendation if you can afford it and installing ubuntu or fedora using virtualbox.

I have been using various distributions of Linux for several years now (Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat) and would certainly recommend checking Ubuntu out. It forces you to be a lot more computer literate than you would otherwise be. Also, using the terminal becomes second nature. The good thing about Ubuntu vs Linux in the 90s is that you don't have to do that; you can easily run Ubuntu as your primary operating system without ever touching the terminal (though you are certainly more limited by your GUI than on Windows).      If you do check it out, you'll come to find that things like package managers makes everything SUPER easy. Most programming languages work out of the box.

If I'm kind of on the fence between looking for a straight data analysis role, and software engineering for data science, should I go with the one that I think I'm weaker on/won't have much exposure to otherwise?   Data scientists are jacks of all trades. A quick look at the most recent survey salary from O'Reilly shows a pretty strong correlation between the number of tools a person is proficient in and salary. I don't think I'll ever tell someone NOT to learn something new or to improve upon a skill that they are relatively weak in, but the bigger question is what do you want to do long term? Do you want to be a BI/Analyst? Doesn't really sound like it. These days companies slap the ""analyst"" title onto just about anything even remotely related to data or business performance. You seem to want to do more along the lines of traditional data science or data systems engineering. Without knowing what types of things you'd potentially be doing in the other positioned you applied for, it's really hard to say one way or the other. Key point though, no matter what happens, don't let yourself end up with nothing. The first position sounds like its promising. Don't let yourself miss out on that by holding out in hopes of another position that you don't yet have.    Also, I'm interested in going to grad school for a PhD in applied statistics or OR (not counting on it, given my not-terribly stellar GPA and lack of published research; working on both, though). Would they possibly care about either kind of experience?   Look, I'm not going to lie to you, GPA's can be a huge drag when it comes to grad school admissions. That said, you still have the opportunity to do well on the GRE (which can definitely help). I wouldn't really fret about publications/research as an undergrad. They can help, but so can quality internships/work experience. So yes, graduate schools will care about your internships and work experience.   Based on the type of work that you seem to want to do, I think that getting all of your ducks in a row and working towards strengthening your resume (academic and professional) for graduate school would be a wise move. You way want to consider a masters as well if you aren't confident about your chances at getting into a PhD program right away. At least anecdotally I've noticed that about half of the data scientists  I work with have a masters and the other half have a PhD. There is the occasional person that only has a bachelors, but they also tend to have 10+ years of relevant work experience. I think that the best thing to do to move forward are to lock down an internship, get yourself some hands-on experience, and then evaluate your long-term career plan.  tl;dr: take the internship that will give you the most hands-on experience. Don't let it slip through your fingers and end up with nothing. Grad school."

But they work together.   Past interns have worked on building data pipelines with the warehousing teams, or prototyping code optimization processes (e.g. Cython), but the department and projects are expanding. I've tried pushing to get more specific details about projects, but it's still early out and I don't think they have specific projects in mind. They're very flexible about mobility, though, and I think I'd get a decent amount of input in pushing more towards the data sides of things.   eep, that was long - but I definitely was thinking of accepting the offer, just wasn't sure if I should keep looking around. I guess I hear less about people moving from SWE roles, than straight out of academia or from work experience in analyst roles.

datascience,2rav1v,hashbrohash,6,Sun Jan 4 14:26:19 2015 UTC,"So I graduated with a BSc in Psychology and have since moved into a much more technical field (computational and systems neuroscience). I am currently doing a lot of data science stuff on the side. I'll pass on the few pieces of wisdom I've learned.      First I want to say that this transition is hard. You really need to dive into the maths and just become incredibly familiar with it. I hadn't done calculus until I was entering my final year of undergrad, at which point I just sat down and solved simple calculus problems in my spare time. There is really no way around this. Not having a good handle on calculus will prevent you from understanding so many things. It will also significantly enrich your life. Spend some time learning calculus! At some point you should also start handling discrete maths and linear algebra (the former is definitively my weak spot). Linear algebra is more advanced material though so be careful with prematurely jumping into it. Calculus isn't strictly speaking a prerequisite of linear algebra, but the mathematical maturity you need to appreciate it often comes from doing some calculus first.      Okay. That's maths. Now, programming. Can you code and if so, how well? Although Psych graduates don't generally learn to program, there is ample opportunity to do so. I coded up the vast majority of my thesis research project (visual psychophysics) myself, albeit in Matlab. Otherwise, you need to get on it. Start doing side projects if you can't do anything degree-related.      I wouldn't recommend applying for a data science master's until you have a fairly good handle on the basic maths and are a fairly proficient programmer. The chances of failure in this case are pretty high, I fear.      Let me know if I can help in any way. Best of luck."

Stick with what you know, whether it's C/C++, Java, MATLAB, etc., and then once you've gotten a handle on the various methods and algorithms, apply that to other languages.

At the very least you need to understand the notion of a derivative and integral. That sort of stuff is just kind of necessary to appreciate the relationship between probability density and cumulative distributions and well, a tonne of other stuff. Depending on your area, you would also want this for stuff like Fourier transform (to at least understand what's going on or why it works). Ideally, you would want to know a thing or two about partial differential equations (especially for machine learning stuff). For linear algebra, knowing the mechanics of vectors and matrices (linear equations, as you say) is crucial. For understanding stuff like PCA you need to know about eigenvectors, bases, etc. You don't really need to understand much in great detail to apply prepackaged algorithms, but it will be hard to appreciate when it is sensible to use things like PCA if you don't know what it actually does."

The shorter version is the following:   Find a job posting From that job posting extract the programming languages they want From that job posting extract the data they use From that job posting extract the things they care about (visualization, modeling, prediction, classification, dimensionality reduction, regression, clustering, etc...) From that job posting see what other words pop up (in the article linked, the job posting talks about NOAA weather data) Put together a project that uses the data from #2, #3, #4, and #5 above.   In the link above, I looked at a capital one data science job posting. They mentioned NOAA weather data. They mentioned financial transaction data. They mentioned using APIs and external data sources. They mentioned R, Python, and Java. They mentioned predictive analytics.  So one project that I suggest was using NOAA weather in combination with a proxy for financial transaction data to do some predictive modeling and data exploration. The proxy for financial transaction data is the hashtag ""#bought"" on twitter. So you could do some API work with Twitter, some data munging work with NOAA weather, and then do some modeling.

datascience,2r9elz,reallyserious,1 point,Sun Jan 4 08:15:46 2015 UTC,There are two fundamentally different techniques for parsing xml. DOM and SAX.  If the DOM tree would fit in ram i would choose a DOM parser any day but if that is not an option then a SAX parser is the way forward.  Files often take 10 times more ram than they take on disk when losded into a DOM tree. So if you have a 10 gb file you're looking at 100 gb ram. That just doesn't work. Use a SAX parser instead for those cases. SAX uses streaming forward-only reading which results in practically no ram usage. It makes querying the xml much more complicated though since you will need to keep track of everything yourself but for large xml files it's your only option.

It really depends on what you want to do with it after you read it.   DO NOT use something like Etree in Python. YOu would need nearly 30 GB of RAM to parse it into memory and interact with it."
datascience,2r6egr,dman87,1 point,Sat Jan 3 15:18:35 2015 UTC,You can use iterparse in python. This way you can build a tree only for the relatively small subset of the whole xml and still get all the benefits i.e. easy conversion to dict and transferring to a database record...
datascience,2r6egr,nesicarh,1 point,Sat Jan 3 19:42:11 2015 UTC,"Sax parser for xml, parses xml without loading the file into the memory. you will find implementations for it in most of programming languages.  though it might be slower than normal parsers for some type of queries."

There are commercial products out there to capture mouse moves, hovers, clicks etc - but this may not be the way you want to go.  My gut reaction would be to suggest the use of a graph database - this may be more suited to the ""edges and nodes"" nature of your problem.  This may also give you edge ""weights"" (identifying the frequency of traversal between thing 'x' and thing 'y' on a page or between pages) more naturally/instinctively.  I'm moving onto shaky ground now (I'm not a web expert AT ALL), but I would suggest looking at session id and timestamp as a ""key"" to your data, if this is available."

But back then, a lot of consulting companies like Anderson Consulting (now defunct for a while), Deloitte, and Booze Allen were hiring industrial engineers like crazy for business analyst positions or programming positions.

datascience,2qjokh,fhadley,8,Sat Dec 27 18:04:06 2014 UTC,"I can help with both. I do consulting for data viz on the side (30 - 60 billed hours a month).  I also work as a procurement officer for the government in the area of IT, and specifically involving professional services.   I see a LOT of pricing. Here's what I'd say I see for pricing spectrum :  Talented amateurs or hobbyists: $65 - $100 an hour   Entry level professional, freelancer, or small business: $100 - $150 an hour.  Consultants with a good track record and multi-disciplinary skills, specialized consulting firms: $125 - $175 (much more heavily weighted to the $150-$175 range).  Companies that do this for a living - professionals who can execute complex tasks, have references, and can bring multiple viewpoints, professional backgrounds and toolsets to bear on a problem : $150 - $225  The A-Team - this could be some of IBM or SRI's insanely talented engineers - people who are so smart that its a little frightening. You find some very small, very highly specialized consulting groups here, people with a very narrow niche where they are the clear leader in the field (these are usually bought up by the big guys before they get here though). You also find the rare rockstar here, that one in a million individual who brings math skills, art skills, data skills, and people skills all to the table : $200 - $400 an hour, but the sky's the limit.   From a personal perspective, always be upfront about what you charge and be consistent. If you want to reward interesting or fun projects do it after the fact - bill the same rate but don't bill for the full hours. Just tell them you got it done with fewer hours than you thought.   Lowering your rate, in my opinion, is radioactive. It weakens your position and will follow you around wherever you go afterwards.   On a related note - your local state government probably buys tens (or hundreds) of millions of dollars in consulting and professional services. You, as a citizen, have a right to access this data. Call your state government and ask for the rates the pay. They'll just tell you."

I'm honestly blown away by the rates you're quoting, as I frankly had no idea folks were billing so high.   Are these rates for data science specific tasks or software engineering generally? I'm particularly curious about this distinction because I have a background that fits your ""consultant"" level pricing (published novel research, solid track record on big projects, some minor open source contributions, etc.), but I find myself quoting at the ""talented amateur or hobbyist"" level, mostly because I specialize in the mathier parts of data science and don't have much experience w/ deployment, etc. This is not to say I suffer from the netflix problem (overly complex models that can't be deployed), as I'm perfectly comfortable serializing my  model and deploying it as an API endpoint to get predictions, but I am just laughably bad at the rest of the web dev required to deploy. I suspect that this makes less valuable to clients looking for ""turnkey"" data science solutions, to the point that I've considered sub-contracting out the remaining parts of the deployment work. I have no idea how I'd start with that or if it's even a good move or not.   I entirely agree that lowering my rate is bad practice; I can intellectually grasp this fact, but in practice I struggle with its implementation. I'm particularly bad about maintaining rate consistency when I'm sympathetic to the client's cause (i.e. non-profits, start ups doing meaningful work, and, strangely, local gov't).   That's an excellent point on the availability of state data on this. I don't do much government (and zero state-level) work, so I wonder how these rates would compare to private sector numbers.  Thank you again for such a detailed answer, I sincerely appreciate it.  Edit: What are your thoughts on quoting hourly vs fixed rates?"

You'll probably have to produce a few tables and graphs for the exam.  If you're weak on predictive modeling, get cracking on this: http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Fourth%20Printing.pdf  If they ask you to build a predictive model, and you're strapped for time after doing a lot of exploration, throw a Random Forest at the data first."

datascience,2q7du8,watersign,3,Tue Dec 23 23:25:59 2014 UTC,"Well it's isn't always creating features as it is extracting the meaningful information from them. Or generating composite features.

I've worked with a lot of social media data, so features are things like natural language. There you have to deal with things like spelling, emoticons, slang, hashtags and all that, along with geolocation, user info, comment count/rate, the set of things that people have 'liked.' It gets messy fast.  The problem is, there's an abundance of possible features. Finding the ones that actually let you build a useful predictions is a challenge."

Since this is a gross oversimplification, it'll help you to understand some scenarios where this is true and some where it isn't.  Where it tends to be true:  You have 50 observations.  Doubling your N to 100 and using Linear Regression will likely work better than random forest (or whatever) on the 50 observation set.  Where it tends not to be true:  You have 50,000 observations.  Doubling your N to 100,000 and using Linear Regression will likely NOT work better than random forest (or whatever) on the 50,000 obs set.  Essentially, flexible methods need a larger N (in conjunction with regularization) to combat overfit, but once you've reached a critical size then the marginal gain from each additional observation becomes small..... to the point where it makes more sense to use the ""extra"" data for training a stacking algorithm."

I deferred for a few years, before letting go of my acceptance and instead applying and matriculating in to a PhD program in health informatics/CS/stats.  I currently work as a data scientist for a health tech company in the bay area, and am a part-time PhD student.  Your experience with medicine can be incredibly helpful if it's combined with the right experience with data.  Taking a few courses on coursera (or similar) is a decent place to start and evaluate if this really is something that interests you; however that's not sufficient to actually get a well-paying job.  Since you're already in medical school, you might consider taking some courses in epidemiology or biostatistics at your med school or public health school.  You might also see if you can do a dual MD/DO-MPH program.  In my opinion (and experience), those are the best courses to line you up for data science position specifically in the health sector.  If you're not interested in health at all, and would rather just do general data stuff for whatever company will hire you, then you should be looking at computer science (algorithms, machine learning) and statistics coursework.  Again, check it out on coursera to see if you like it, but don't count that as a substitute for formal coursework and experience.  Keep in mind that ""data science"" is not a well defined term, and that it varies dramatically from company to company.

At this point in my studies, I can finish almost all of my coursework online, and because I'm working in the same field I'm studying, I can tap my work for research projects related to my PhD.  Being remote means not having to worry about commute times.  So, it's working out really well in that regard.  I'm not in a rush to finish, and at this point I'm not getting pressure from the University to move along.  So, I'm just taking 1-2 courses/semester, and am thinking I'll probably do prelims in a year or so.  The best advice I can offer is to be open with everyone involved.  My work knows I'm still a PhD student, and they're excited about how my research can improve my work.  My school knows that I'm working, and appreciates the experience that it's giving me.

But in all seriousness: There seem to be questions floating around about how automatable a lot of data science is, and how operationally learnable (OL) it is.  If automatable: long-term job prospects may not be great.  If operationally learnable: By operationally learnable I mean that the field can be taught as a set of reasonably low-level skills that can be learned by many people (think codemonkeys).  This would mean that many people can then do most of the data science jobs, and suddenly wages won't look so good.  (Personally, I don't think that data science is OL; it is multidisciplinary and requires some experience to do right.  But I feel the same way about coding.  I think that there is a perception that coding is OL, and that has led to a glut of workers with some coding skills but little coding talent.  I think there is a growing perception that data science is mostly just coding, and so we seem to be heading for a situation where coders will be doing data science.  Everyone panic.)"

datascience,2prrxd,datakittenMEOW,2,Sat Dec 20 19:13:47 2014 UTC,"1) Internships aren't as critical in the data world as they are in high finance. I still think an internship would be helpful in getting your first job out of college (in general, internships are one of the top things employers look for in hiring for entry-level jobs). Note though that there are probably almost no internships where you'd be doing actual ""data science"" (if we define data science as either doing machine learning or working with large, unstructured data), more likely you would be looking into data analysis or business intelligence internships. Most true ""data science"" jobs (see above definition) are held by people with graduate degrees, whereas most (but not all) people doing data science with only a bachelor's are mostly doing data cleaning and querying and less of the analysis. This is purely based on anecdotes, if someone wants to disagree please do so.  2) Yes, by all means apply to internships for the summer. Don't limit yourself to internships with ""data science"" in the title, I think any sort of data analysis, research, or business intelligence internship will do. It's going to be really difficult to find an undergraduate internship where you'll be doing real data science (and those internships are most likely going to CS/stats majors who already know basic machine learning). But that's OK. Just get expose to real-world data. If you're able to say you ran a few SQL queries in your internship, that would give you a leg up over people who haven't gotten to work with real-world data before. Being a research assistant to an economics professor (or stats/CS) may also be a really good option, as likely you'd be preparing data for them.  3) Yes.  4) So you're about to be a second semester junior, and you're planning on dropping economics for statistics as a second major, and adding a CS minor? If this is all possible, go for it. Where I went to school this wouldn't be possible without staying for an extra year, or maybe taking a bunch of classes over the summer.   5) Trying searching this subreddit, or searching Google for ""data science resources,"" and you'll get good results.   6) Although statistics/CS are better majors for learning data science, why are you dropping your economics major? I only ask because you indicated that you are interested in using data to answer social science questions, which is basically what empirical economics is. The vast majority of data science jobs do not involve answering social science questions, I'm sure that some do, but if you want to use data to answer social science questions full-time I would consider going the economics professor route. Economists are admittedly behind the times in the computational department, but that doesn't mean you can't learn CS/ML on your own, and apply that knowledge to the discipline."
datascience,2prrxd,Please_Dont_Even,2,Fri Dec 19 13:35:40 2014 UTC,"Disagree with point #1 regarding data science internships. There are a good amount of them out there with some very good tech companies, and they'll do a lot for your resume. I just did one last summer (after my sophomore year) with some heavy machine learning aspects and working with lots of data. This helped me land an internship at Google on a machine learning team (though as a SWE).   Definitely look for actual data science and machine learning internships, as they are out there and will help you. The industry is starting to lower the academic bar for data science jobs more and more, so there will definitely be chances for undergrads to gain real world data experience."

He does work with a lot of data so that might help out, perhaps I can think about doing some sort of project to make his life easier with Stata?   I'm switching from econ to stats at my school because at my school stats is treated like a social science as well. It largely has to do with how to obtain unbiased data, and what to do with that data afterwards. I've taken the bulk of economics courses offered at my school (all the major ones, the only ones I have left are 3 field courses, kind of like elective econ courses) and I feel as though there isn't much utility left towards taking a few more econ courses. With stats I feel as though not only will I become better at analyzing data, but I will also learn a whole bunch of techniques and problems in data analyzing that I have never encountered before. I am also considering the fact that my current major (the math/social science one) will take care of a lot of my social science education.  Thanks for 2), I haven't looked for data science internships yet, but it seems like in general 2) is true for the undergraduates.   4) This is possible, given that things in my schedule line up pretty well.

datascience,2pmkwd,hahdawg,2,Wed Dec 17 23:27:55 2014 UTC,"R2 is used for determining how well your model fits the data.  0 means your model's no better than just taking the average of your dependent variable. 1.0 means means your model perfectly fits the data.  It's not really a useful statistic these days, because a lot of techniques are flexible enough to perfectly fit your data but do an awful job of prediction.  Probably, the only useful rule you can get from R2 is that if it's 0 or 1, your model's not going to work very well.  Before you tackle machine learning, I'd suggest reading a very basic textbook on regression.  Anything I recommend would be out of print, but I'm sure others have some good suggestions."
datascience,2pmkwd,hahdawg,1 point,Wed Dec 17 23:57:14 2014 UTC,"Isn't that the Pearson coefficient, which is just r, not r2 ?

datascience,2pmkwd,Cheese_Is_Great,1 point,Thu Dec 18 00:15:28 2014 UTC,"Pretty sure Pearson's coefficient is just correlation.  If so, I wouldn't think of regression in terms of plain correlations--especially when you have more than one predictor.  I would say that R2 doesn't matter much, but it's important to get comfortable enough with the math that you understand what it's trying to measure.  To answer your questions:    So, does this mean to say that, let's say Y is obesity and X is mass of cake consumed, any movement in obesity is 63% directly attributable to cake consumed, and therefore 37% is other factors?   Definitely not ""directly attributable"".  If you step back and think practically, obesity depends on a lot more than just cake consumption.  If you have one variable, cake consumption, and it explains 63% of obesity, it must be correlated with a lot of other things that cause obesity; for example, maybe having fat parents makes you more likely to consume cake, but your model is (mistakenly) attributing all the fat parent effect to cake.   Does this mean also that if you observe someone eating a certain amount of cake, you can calculate how much more obese he will get (using z-scores maybe? not sure how this would work)?   If you have a model for obesity, where cake is the only predictor, you can definitely use it predict obesity.  For example, if your model is   obesity = 1.5 + 3.4*(cake slices consumed per week),   just plug in cake slices per week for someone in order to predict his obesity.  But R2 is almost certainly not the measure of predictive accuracy you want."

But if you are a recent grad (less than 1 year) with no masters degree, I'd just hang in there at 50k for a year, and see it bumped up to 70-75 next year. They are billing the client at $100/hr, but you aren't the only one who worked to get that client. There's you in production, people in marketing, and even some investors doing nothing but got the company to the place where that client can exist. They all get a cut on that $100/hr. Most tech companies target a profit margin of 30%, so theres really only $70 up for grabs, of which you are getting $25. Seems pretty fair for all parties involved."
datascience,2piw21,UpDown,4,Wed Dec 17 03:04:11 2014 UTC,"So the thing about medians is that they include a full range of people. From entry level (yourself) to people with advanced degrees and years of experience. I'd agree that your pay is a bit lower than is expect especially if it is contract work (typically contract work pays better to offset the reduced benefits), but def not outrageous for a recent grad. The best thing you can do is to document what you do along they way. Build up your resume. If there are R, Python, data analyst or other ""user groups"" in your area make an effort to get involved and network. Are you on LinkedIn? If not, then you should be. I average 1-2 soft job offers a month based on my LinkedIn profile alone. I am no rockstar, I just make an effort to make myself as visible as possible to the people doing the hiring. You may also want to consider making your own website to showcase some of your abilities. Continue learning and adding new data tools to your skill set, and don't get discouraged that you aren't making the top dollar at your first job. Once you have some solid experience companies tend to be much more willing to pay you a competitive wage (an important part of that is going into your job search knowing what a realistic competitive wage is). When it finally comes time to start your job search, make sure you start your search early. Be ready to apply to A LOT of jobs. Don't limit yourself to a particular industry or job title.

Charging someone out with that ratio I would say is not uncommon. I don't like in US but I live in one of the most expensive cities in the world.  You say that you don't have any time to do anything impressive but your technology stack is extremely modern and extremely impressive. My advice for you is rather than trying to work on a portfolio, which seems like the direction you'd like to head down - work on networking.  I don't think that you will magically jump another $50k a year and start earning $100k a year in your current job - have a look at what positions are available elsewhere and see what they are offering. I can tell you that after working for 1 year as a data analyst I received offers from $50k-80k from other companies through networking/applying for jobs.

You aren't doing ""data science"" yet, you're doing business intelligence engineering (automating ETL, visualization, reports etc).  That said, I was in the exact same boat about 5 years ago.  I was in an BI engineering role (extremely similar to what you described) and was labeled a ""business analyst"" and was paid the same as you.  If you go in to your employer comparing your work to data science I do not foresee it going over well, but still you aren't being paid equitably for your work as a BI engineer (you aren't simply an analyst for god's sake).

I finished the MS Predictive Analytics program at Northwestern and that allowed me to get my foot in the door with a little networking.  Your programming experience is a HUGE boon in DS - now get the stats piece (if you don't have it) and then IMO, decide if you can on which DS path you prefer - there are data scientists who specialize a bit more in data management, some who focus on descriptive models and others who are experts in ML.  The idea that someone can be an expert in all of these things is absurd.

The main problems are:   how one infers high-dimensional structure from low-dimensional representations; and how one assembles discrete points into global structure.   The human brain can easily extract global structure from representations in a strictly lower dimension, i.e. we infer a 3D environment from a 2D image from each eye. The inference of global structure also occurs when converting discrete data into continuous images, e.g. dot-matrix printers and televisions communicate images via arrays of discrete points.  The main method used by topological data analysis is:   Replace a set of data points with a family of simplicial complexes, indexed by a proximity parameter. Analyse these topological complexes via algebraic topology — specifically, via the theory of persistent homology.  Encode the persistent homology of a data set in the form of a parameterized version of a Betti number which is called a persistence diagram or barcode.

For one, they have top 20 CS and Math programs, indicating that the environment there would be conducive to a strong Data Science program.  On top of that a degree from Columbia carries more weight due to the prestige of the school.  Here is the catch: NYC is a great job market but you'll still end up finding more opportunities with financial firms and hedge funds than anything else. SF might be a bit better of a location if you want a more pure tech firm.  I'd still pick Columbia though."

It looks like you have a quantitative background which is good. The one thing I see lacking is programming experience.  You said you have used excel. Have you used VBA at all (a programming language in Excel that can be very helpful to know). I use Excel everyday, but that is only because it is the lingua franca of data.   Typically the end product of all my analysis ends up in excel or Tableau (see below), but it is not the tool I use for analysis.  For all the analysis and data management I do I use SAS, R, and SQL.  Python is also a very popular language for many data scientists as well.  If you Google ""learn SAS/R/SQL"" you will come up with plenty of resources to help you learn.  Another program that would be worth looking at is Tableau.  It is a data visualization program that allows for dashboards to be easily created.

If you have many of the other skills they are looking for you may still be of interest to potential employers.   I just graduated back in may with a BA as well, so I am pretty in tune with ""the struggle"" of getting a job.  The University I went to had several career fairs throughout the year, and I ultimately landed a job through one of those.  It really helps if you can show a face and make a connection with recruiters.  Throughout my time in college, I applied to probably upwards of 100 internships in total, and I never heard back from all the employers that I just randomly applied online to.  Making a connection helps so much.    LinkedIn was a pretty great resources as well, if you are not already on there. It is a really great networking tool, and many recruiters are on the site.  If you put keywords about what you are seeking in your about you/description section (""data analyst"", ""big data"", ""analytics"", etc.) you may show up in some filters on there.   In LinkedIn, there are also a ton of job postings.  A quick search of ""data"" in LinkedIn pulled a hundreds of jobs. Granted, I did not look at their locations or requirements, but I assume there are some relevant jobs in there.

datascience,2pfqdo,xvtsx,1 point,Tue Dec 16 15:38:08 2014 UTC,Could you expand on the LinkedIn of your post? I'm interested in learning more about it.
datascience,2pfqdo,frisbee_hero,1 point,Thu Dec 18 21:38:10 2014 UTC,"Yeah for sure!  Sorry it took me a couple days to get back to you.    LinkedIn was a pretty great resources as well, if you are not already on there. It is a really great networking tool, and many recruiters are on the site. If you put keywords about what you are seeking in your about you/description section (""data analyst"", ""big data"", ""analytics"", etc.) you may show up in some filters on there.   There are a TON of recruiters on Linkedin that attempt to find adequate candidates for their companies respective programs.  As such, it is very important to really put time into your LinkedIn profile.  A lot a people simply list the job titles they have had and their education; however, I do not think that is an adequate approach.  If, for example, a recruiter went to someones page and they had the title ""business analyst"" but no description of what they did, then the person is not doing a good job of communicating the skills and expertise they have.  In my opinion, LinkedIn should be treated as a glorified resume.  On the LinkedIn page, describe who you are, your strengths, the type of work you are looking to find, specific things about your work history, relevant classes taken in university, etc.  Personally, I aim to not have anyone leave my page without having an at least basic idea of who I am and my experiences.    You can also attempt to find recruiters and introduce yourself to them on LinkedIn.  I don't have much experience doing this; however, the following article may provide incite: Link.  Doing searches such as ""recruiter data"" bring up a TON of recruiters in the data field.  Making connections with people is critical.  In my experience, it was extremely hard to even get interviews without establishing some sort of relationship with folks, but, as I said, I don't have a ton of experience making connections in the online medium.  Utilizing your network to introduce you to people can be very helpful as well.  For example, if you want to work at Company A, you can search your connections and see if they know anyone in Company A and ask to speak with them.  Personally, I don't treat taking with people at a company as anything more than an informational interview about the company. Those types of interactions are helpful to determine if the company culture is a good fit for you or not.   In terms of finding jobs, LinkedIn is just a great way to find what is out there.  There is the ""Jobs"" tab where you can search LinkedIn for positions. Searches such as ""data"", ""data scientist"", ""data analyst"", etc. yield tens of thousands of hits.  One of the best features is that when you click on a job to get more information about it, you can often see the information about the recruiter who posted the job.  I mentioned previously the importance of making connections.  If you were to find a job you were interested in, it would by no means hurt to reach out to the recruiter and ask to set up a brief phone call for an informational interview about the position and the company.  It shows interest, initiative, and it makes you stand out to all the other applicants who simply blindly applied  Is that what you were looking for?

datascience,2pe710,timClicks,3,Mon Dec 15 23:59:21 2014 UTC,"There is a corpus of statistics associated with quality assurance processes.  Much of data science work revolves around overseeing large systems in action, and then producing an executive summary, risk assessment, or a prediction of the outcome from some change in strategy.  In this context, schools of thought have mathematical methods that are catered to the situation: Bayesian probability is suited for informing an agent to make the best choice; whereas Frequentist techniques are aimed at inferring the optimum decision for an entity to select.  So, given that dichotomy of application, the fundamental tools of significance testing and confidence intervals can indicate what is the right path to an agent or entity, respectively.  The prototypical agent has a finite set of options, so the utility of a significance test is commonly the answer to a yes or no question, like if a random batch of goods is defective.  The archetypal entity is a stakeholder concerned about the ranges of risk and reward, so a confidence interval allows them to infer what is best for the whole.  Leadership roles require prognostication, and Data Scientists are expected to provide regression models of future outcomes.  As an aside, I made a subreddit for this sort of discussion: /r/Datalogy . Questions like this require a response based on an academic view of commercial skills, hence the suffix of the eponymous term (courtesy of Peter Naur).  If anyone should find the sub inviting or interesting, then I might write a longer post on the three fundamental tools of: significance testing, confidence intervals, and regression modelling."

So while you may not find either gnuplot or Tobii to be particularly useful to you in the immediate future, it's very possible that you may find yourself better prepared for a yet to be determined data science project further down the road.

datascience,2pabt1,timClicks,1 point,Sun Dec 14 20:06:19 2014 UTC,"Opening para for the lazy:   Open data has tremendous potential for science, but, in human subjects research, there is a tension between privacy and releasing high-quality open data. Federal law governing student privacy and the release of student records suggests that anonymizing student data protects student privacy. Guided by this standard, we de-identified and released a data set from 16 MOOCs (massive open online courses) from MITx and HarvardX on the edX platform. In this article, we show that these and other de-identification procedures necessitate changes to data sets that threaten replication and extension of baseline analyses. To balance student privacy and the benefits of open data, we suggest focusing on protecting privacy without anonymizing data by instead expanding policies that compel researchers to uphold the privacy of the subjects in open data sets. If we want to have high-quality social science research and also protect the privacy of human subjects, we must eventually have trust in researchers. Otherwise, we'll always have the strict tradeoff between anonymity and science illustrated here."

Inferring emotion?  MMORPGs whose rules react to changing big data sets, like stock market data?  What's coming? Ideas for transitioning from academia to industry?  (Not that I'm looking...but since I'm currently up to my eyeballs in grading the work of unmotivated students, I might be looking...) Any awesome stories that didn't make it into the book?  (Too racy, too off-topic, etc.)   Thanks again!  EDIT: Shoot, sorry, just glanced at the book page on Amazon... 4. Kindle version?"
datascience,2oyzvu,machinedunlearned,10,Thu Dec 11 14:16:18 2014 UTC,"""Next big thing""    Data wise: is medical / health data (if it can be done properly). The investor (Roger Ehrenberg) thought it was a generational opportunity. The things that are possible are enormous. Several of the interviewees have worked with health/medical data before and would do so again. Math wise: Eric Jonas (ex chief-predictive officer at Salesforce.com) believes it's probabilistic programming and methods related to it. Algorithm wise: Kira Radinsky (SalesPredict and MIT 35 under 35) had this to say... ""where I see the future—much less in the data stack and much more in working with the algorithms on top of it."" Yann LeCun (Facebook) had this to say... ""there is a point where there are just not enough brain cells on the planet to even look or even glance at that data, let alone analyze it and extract knowledge from it. So it’s clear that most of the knowledge in the world in the future is going to be extracted by machines and will reside in machines."""
datascience,2oyzvu,solarpoweredbiscuit,13,Thu Dec 11 14:30:04 2014 UTC,"2 Academia to industry   Erin Shellman (Nordstrom) switched from Bioinformatics to data science. Her take on it was ""For the person who’s trying to transition like I did, I would say, for one, it’s hard. Be aware that it’s difficult to change industries and you are going to have to work hard at it. That’s not unique to data science—that’s life. Not having any connections in the field is tough but you can work on it through meet-ups and coffee dates with generous people. My number-one rule in life is “follow up.” If you talk to somebody who has something you want, follow up. I heard a story from a director of a data lab similar to ours, about a potential hire that didn’t have the skills and experience required to join the team. He sug- gested the candidate take a machine learning class on Coursera and figure out if data science was more than a fleeting interest. The candidate took the course and every week emailed the director notes on progress and asked follow-up questions. I think this is a really great example of putting in the extra effort and proving to potential employers and to yourself that you can do what it takes to succeed as a data scientist. I’m pretty sure they got the job too."""
datascience,2oyzvu,HAL9000000,3,Thu Dec 11 14:32:47 2014 UTC,The candidate took the course and every week emailed the director notes on progress and asked follow-up questions   Wouldn't this be rather annoying for the director?
datascience,2oyzvu,voodoochile78,7,Thu Dec 11 21:34:57 2014 UTC,"No, this would not be annoying. Here's why:   The director is trying to hire someone for a position The potential hire chatted with the director The director told the candidate to do something The most natural thing in the world to do if you really want the job is to email the director that you are doing it and tell them what you learned And, if you have questions as related to the specific job, directly related to what you are learning ask If the director doesn't respond, no skin off of your back If the director responds, then keep doing it.   People out there (and in this sub) talk about the lack of good candidates, the lack of people who are willing to learn, and what a hiring war it is out there.   A candidate who shows that they give a sh*t about the job, that they want it, and that they are willing to do free work (learn enough to be employable) is definitely worth a second look. A director who knows how hard it is to hire candidates, will certainly look twice at someone who shows some grit. After all what's the cost to the director? Maybe 5 minutes a week? If it works out, the director will have a candidate who has already half-way proven themselves to work hard, learn what's necessary, and to communicate clearly. That's awesome in the director's eyes..."

Everyone did a good job about talking about it, but it's hard to capture the tone of their voice of the sparkle in their eyes when they dive into talking about their work.

datascience,2oyzvu,egocogito,10,Thu Dec 11 17:34:57 2014 UTC,"Q: Why do you find it necessary to rename the profession?   Great provocative question that's on many people's minds! Chris Wiggins (New York Times, Columbia University) has a lot of good quotes, so i'll give you some of his thoughts on this... ""Trying to understand the world through data and your computer is a very good idea. That’s why Tukey was writing about it in 1962 when he was ordering everybody to reorient statistics as a profes- sional discipline and a funding line for the NSF organized around computation and data and data analysis. He wrote an article in 1962 called 'The Future of Data Analysis.' [John W. Tukey, “ The Future of Data Analysis”: Ann. ￼Math. Statist., Volume 33, Number1 (1962),1-67.] And he wasn’t the last, right?"" ""Leo Breiman all throughout the 1990s was writing to his community of statisticians, “Let us get with data, statistics community!” He was writing papers in the late 1990s telling all his colleagues to start going to NIPS. [https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/wald2002-1.pdf] It was like he had gone into the wilderness and come back and said to everybody at Berkeley,which was one of the first mathematical statistics departments,“You guys need to wake up because it’s on fire. You guys are proving theorems. It’s on fire out there. Wake up!”"" Yann LeCun (Facebook, NYU) has this to say: ""This is something that some people aren’t quite grasping at this point. For instance, if you are a statistician, you say, “Well, that’s just statistics.” If you’re a machine learning person, you say, “Well, that’s just machine learn- ing.” If you are a database person, you say, “Well, that’s just a database, with a bit of machine learning and statistics on top.” If you’re an applied math person, you say, “Well, all of these techniques and methods use applied math.” All of those people are wrong. It’s all of those things combined into one discipline: statistics plus applied math plus computation plus infrastructure plus the application areas, which are the things that those methods can be applied to, which require expertise."""" After having spoken to the 16 people, and read countless interviews and articles, and watched tons of videos, I find myself falling into most of their thinking in that ""Data Science"" is not ""statistics"" with a new name, but actually a separate field."
datascience,2oyzvu,jsalsman,2,Thu Dec 11 17:58:13 2014 UTC,"LeCun's expertise quote is pivotal. This is a second-hand account from Cathy O'Neil, but she said one of the big hurdles for the Data Science Institute at Cathy O'Neil was bridging the cultural gaps between Computer Scientists and the fields they're working in (ie: journalism and medicine)."

datascience,2oyzvu,DinosaurChemist,1 point,Fri Dec 12 03:55:18 2014 UTC,"A few thoughts:   Amy Heineike (Quid) has the title of ""Director of Mathematics"". Here's what she had to say about titles: ""When I got to Silicon Valley six years ago, there wasn’t a name for what I do. I was just curious about getting to poke around the data and figuring out what products we could build on it. At the time, it was very weird to think of having a mathematician doing that. And so I don’t think anyone knew why I was there or what to call me. Pretty soon it became apparent that combining a mathematical bent with a focus on data and product building was very useful. People now typically call this ‘Data Scientist’, but we came up with the Director of Mathematics title—which I’m sticking with because I like it."" Caitlin Smallwood (Netflix) manages a large team of ""data scientists"" all of whom have all kinds of titles. Here's what she had to say about titles: ""Titles are always a challenging thing. We didn’t even use the word “data science” a decade ago. So titles across the industry are a challenging thing. In terms of what people do, it’s more self-selecting. People tend to be either more interested in the product and experimentation kind of work, or more interested in algorithms. Even in the algorithms space, some people have very specialized interest in particular types of algorithms. So I think, in general, we try to group people in ways and in areas that they’re most excited about so that you’re getting both the business benefit and people are happy. We’re pretty flexible on titles at Netflix. People can call themselves what they feel like calling themselves."" So based on Amy's and Caitlin's answers, I would say that you should own what title you actually well and truly had at your previous roles. That said, if you are applying for a position, then it's very much to your advantage to tailor your resume and the experiences within it to match what the company is looking for. After all, the resume will probably have to go through HR first if you're replying to job openings online and they'll most likely just be looking for key words."
datascience,2oyzvu,voodoochile78,3,Fri Dec 12 03:53:04 2014 UTC,"I've seen this a few times and I find it a bit odd. There are tonnes of data scientists that aren't statisticians and wouldn't identify as statisticians. I can feel that this is No True Scotsman territory, but to my mind, not all statisticians are data scientists, nor are all data scientists statisticians. I appreciate that many people are doing what they've always been doing and are now all of a sudden being relabelled as data scientists. On the other hand, lots of people are entering the field from CS, engineering and other sciences. It would be a bit odd to stick with the term statistician to describe people who clearly aren't that."

Every interviewee brought this up on their own either before the interview started, during it, or after. They see this as a global issue not just related to the specific data scientists and their companies, but also all the laws and governments in the world. The ones that deal with very very sensitive data have very strong feelings about the data and how to use it correctly. Given their knowledge of the field and the industry, everyone is aware of what is ""evil"" and ""what not to do"" so they are very aware of the line in the sand. The other interesting thing that came out is that for some companies they also see this as a great conversation piece to have with their clients and customers.

There's a joke that ""A data scientist is an analyst that lives in California""    Data science and analysis (or, analytics) are largely the same, though I see data science as analysis++.    At their core, data science and data analysis do the same things: draw insights from data.    The diffference that's emerging is that there are new, 'high powered' tools, and the industry is separating into different segments.  O'Reilly recently published a report detailing the different tools and the segments within the industry.    What I'm getting at is that ""data science"" is largely analysis with better tools, and more sophisticated techniques (advanced data visualization, machine learning, etc)."
datascience,2oltg1,DeltaPunch,8,Mon Dec 8 02:17:13 2014 UTC,"TL;DR:  Jobs in which one could work as a data scientist => all of them (from garbage man/woman to surgeon). If you know someone who has a job that somehow generates data, you could match them up with a data scientist to achieve awesomeness.  Longer story:  What the field of data science strives to do is to learn from data and then use this data to achieve some organizational objective (usually in companies either increase revenue or cut costs).  As data storage costs come down, as data generation increases, as data capture becomes easier, and as the world becomes ever more competitive, it becomes a huge priority for every company to ""utilize"" all of their assets (from inventory to human resources) to the maximum amount.  Which coming back to your question - means that if you can collect data on any part of your business and do it in a fashion that then allows you to build models that help you win, then a data scientist can be hired to do it.  For instance, from this article about google, checkout all the things their HR department is doing: (http://www.tlnt.com/2013/02/26/how-google-is-using-people-analytics-to-completely-reinvent-hr/)  List from the article:   Leadership characteristics and the role of managers The PiLab (determine the most effective approaches for managing people and maintaining a productive environment) Employee retention algorithms Predictive modeling (continually improve their forecasts of upcoming people management problems and opportunities) Improving diversity (conducted analysis to identify the root causes of weak diversity recruiting, retention, and promotions) An effective hiring algorithm Calculating the value of top performers  Workplace design drives collaboration Increasing discovery and learning (discovery and learning through project rotations, learning from failures)   AND THAT'S JUST HR. If that doesn't blow your hair back, I'm not sure what will.  Getting back to the point - every industry is going to start keeping much better track of it's data. Every company within every industry is going to either get the ""religion of data"" or will be left behind. Which means every department of every company is going to have to come to terms that data are going to drive a very large portion of decisions.  So - how do you categorize the jobs available today? You look at any job and think about what data is being generated while doing whatever job it is. Then you put your ""data scientist"" hat on and think about questions like:   Can I use data to predict who is good and who is bad? Can I use data to separate behavior that leads to success from behavior that leads to failure? Can I use data to build incentive structures (and test them) to get the behavior I want Can I .... (the sky is the limit).   Remember - data scientist is mainly a business position. They work in / for an organization that has goals: for-profit is to make profit and more of it next quarter while for non-profit it is to achieve greater good.  So regardless of what problems / jobs / industries / positions you chose to look, think about how you would use data to drive more profit and/or achieve greater good. (Obviously ethics are a huge part of this...)"
datascience,2oltg1,seabass,1 point,Mon Dec 8 04:14:08 2014 UTC,"Fantastic post. Would like to ask a bit more if you have time.   The PiLab (determine the most effective approaches for managing people and maintaining a productive environment)       How do they even do things like this? Effectively have groups doing different things and then compare their results? Or this:       Predictive modeling (continually improve their forecasts of upcoming people management problems and opportunities)        Crunch through your data, see for example that 60% of new parents try and leave the company, so flag up all new parents as at risk of leaving?"
datascience,2oltg1,jia_min,3,Mon Dec 8 10:25:46 2014 UTC,"You can see a video of Prasad Setty, VP of People Analytics & Compensation at Google, explaining the analytic process behind their HR practices here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY8v-O5Buyc  One of their new initiatives is gDNA, surveying a group of employees every 6 months on their workplace perceptions, beliefs, personality traits, and problem-solving processes with the hope of following them for decades.   One sad story is how the People Analytics group came up with an accurate algorithm for promoting software engineers, but it was never used because the engineers hated it (i.e., ""hiding behind a black box to hire""). Boo hoo, ya crybabies."
datascience,2oltg1,datakittenMEOW,2,Mon Dec 8 17:42:02 2014 UTC,"How do they even do things like this? Effectively have groups doing different things and then compare their results?   In the case of determining which methods for managing people work best, it sounds like Google surveys their employees to find out how happy/productive/satisfied they are (which becomes the dependent variable), and then gives different surveys to managers, asking questions about their management style (which becomes the independent variable). At this point, they look at how management style (independent variable) affects employee happiness/productivity (dependent variable). Their actual processes are much more advanced, but this is my impression of how it works at a basic level.    Crunch through your data, see for example that 60% of new parents try and leave the company, so flag up all new parents as at risk of leaving?   Exactly. And their models likely are able to produce results with more granularity than ""all new parents."" If we know that 60% of new parents try and leave the company, we can think of ways to cut the number leaving the company by:     Increasing the duration of paternity/maternity leave. Change company culture/attitudes towards taking time off (I suspect that workplaces that are hostile towards employees taking time off for pregnancy are also hostile towards employees taking time off in general). Offer more flexible scheduling options for in terms of hours and days worked.   Really cool stuff."
datascience,2oltg1,Lolawp,1 point,Mon Dec 8 14:55:13 2014 UTC,"I wonder what sort of data they collect - I mean, a few surveys at the end of the workday is probably not going to represent an accurate picture of an employee, and certainly not the degree of emphasis they are placing on it, according to this article.

Judging from your comment here, you want to get a [rigorous] feel of the grouping landscape of your data. You can do this by running hierarchical clustering on all the dimensions you have here. You can then use the dendrogram to look at the distance between clusters. Since you data is highly dimensional and you have a bunch of categorical variables you definitely need a data preparation step before you can run the model. You may also need to use a different distance function like Jaccard distance that handles categorical data better.   Hope this helps.

datascience,2ob37l,jaseycrowl,3,Thu Dec 4 23:09:39 2014 UTC,"TLDR: If this is really a field you're interested in, get your foot in the door early, and I don't think you need to invest in a data science degree until you can concretely connect that to advancing your career.   Just to put the following into context, I am a teacher/admin (joint role) in the SF Bay Area.  If you're not in the Bay Area, LA, or NYC, this advice is probably wildly different from your options.  Data is really hot in 2 places right now - charter schools and edtech companies.  Both are looking for pretty straightforward data analysts - masters preferred, but if you have strong excel skills and some education knowledge you can find entry level positions. In general, it really helps you to have an education background in any of these positions, or if you're lacking the ed background you need to be stronger on the analysis side of things - having experience with Tableau is a big one (there's a public edition that you can get started with).  Typically, these involve a whole lot of data cleaning, some visualization creation, and some process improvement type work.  If you're really committed to the masters program, you might be able to work into a data scientist role afterwards, but in my experience those are people with experience beyond education - many have worked at big companies in serious data roles for multiple years before coming to education.  The field is still pretty new, it's easy to get your foot in the door, but the top is still a lot of people with strong backgrounds in software development, consulting, finance, etc.  Working at mainstream districts is a little different.  They do have people who do data cleaning and reporting for things like student data, testing, etc, but it's typically a more focused job.  I've met and worked with a lot of these people, they're typically very, very knowledgeable in their particular focus area - something like English Learner reporting for the district to the state. They spend all of their time on that for thousands or tens of thousands of students, and they know it inside and out.  These positions exist across the country, and are fairly common, though probably harder to find openings because staff typically stay longer.  Let me know if you have some more specific questions, I hope that at least helps with a big picture of data science in education."

Yes, of course, you have to eventually learn all of those things. That's just the ticket to get in the door. BUT, right now, you don't need to know everything. RIGHT NOW, you have to figure out a way to take 1 step forward. Then maybe tomorrow, you'll take another step. Then maybe in a few months, you'll come back and tell us about all the cool awesome work you are doing. So for now, ignore Quora. Figure out what companies you want to join that are doing data science: Everybody and their uncle is hiring data scientists. This means that you can go work in the agriculture, social networking, finance, video, audio, text, media, fashion, etc. Every single company out there has data and needs someone with ""data chops"" to do something valuable or insightful with that data. So go figure out who you want to join forces with. It might even be a company that you're already familiar with and/or are working at. Figure out what projects they have done: All companies have data. Take a few minutes to think about the data they could potentially have - sales, web, supply and demand for their products, sales teams, etc.. From there you can start thinking of ""hand-wavy"" ways you could use data science. For instance, given their sales data can you predict next quarter? Given their web data can you build a recommendations engine? Given their supply and demand can you build a classifier for their best/worst customers and can you think of how to predict it sooner than later? etc? Replicate one of their projects.  This will force you to go out and a) learn what tools are available to use, b) learn what state the data is in (how raw is it and how much ""wrangling does it need""), c) what math you need to use.   TL;DR: Forget about math. Find a project and start working on that. Everything you need to know will fall into place as you work on it.  Get to it and good luck!"

datascience,2o6fsj,b1eb,2,Wed Dec 3 20:23:47 2014 UTC,I recently did an online course in calculus at a local community college. I first took calculus 10 years before. The first time I was annoyed that all I was doing was finding slopes and areas on a graph. After using statistics for so long I have come to appreciate calculus and really enjoyed the second time I took the course.  Though I think Masters in Data Science is not a good idea. What happens if the name changes to some other term? I have had a lot of scamy calls recently about getting a Masters in Data Science.  I think a better plan is to start doing projects and create a portfolio of the projects. One of the most important parts of Data Science is the domain you will be using Data Science.

datascience,2o39e2,patrickSwayzeNU,2,Tue Dec 9 16:29:23 2014 UTC,"(Your question make me feel like telling my life on Reddit today)  I have a french master's degree of Philosophy of Economics (but in front of people I just say economics). It was basically economics without the maths. The frustration not do use the math made me want to learn them. 3 years and a half ago I opened ""Mathematics for economists"" by Simon and Blum. I realized that when you learn things step by step, math is actually understandable. Then I kept on reading textbooks about microeconomics and maths. I made the mistake to try to learn hard things too quickly, reading topology books without understanding the point of topology for example, but I liked to have an idea of what terms such as compactness mean.  I just noticed that I forgot to mention at that time I was working as an accountant and was not really enjoying my job (that was not terrible either) but I was living in Canada and that was fun.   Then I discovered Coursera (and then Khan Academy) and it basically changed my life. Learning by myself on textbook was hard. Watching videos was really fun. I woke up early before going to work to watch videos, I watched videos during my lunch break in my cubicle and basically whenever I could. Watching math videos with lots of admin staff around me was really something uncomfortable (I did not want to be considered a nerd).  On Coursera I discovered data analysis, totally unaware it was trendy. I was still thinking ""this ting is too hard for me"" and realized it was not. So I downloaded Octave and tried to complete some of the assignments of the Andrew Ng machine learning class. I then learned R and completed many of the John Hopkins University courses.  I am now in London where there are many companies hiring data analysts/ scientists. It took me 6 month to find a job but I was handicapped by the language at first.  One of my mistake was that when looking for a job I focused to much on learning fancy stuff to put them on my resume instead of solving problems and meeting other data analysts/scientists (using Meet up for instance).  My conclusion is : finding a job in data when you do not have the good degree is doable. But it is easier when you have a related degree (I say economics on my resume...I know...). I still feel a bit strange when I say ""I am a data analyst"" but I am so happy to go to work now!  So that was my story. Hope I didn't bore you.

Do you have to take Linear Algebra through EE? If not, take it.   Between the prob + stats courses and your EE major you're going to be able to destroy the mathematics portions of data science.

My only suggestion course-wise would be to take a CS 101 course, or if you're past that level then consider doing Data Structures/Algorithms. I'm very impressed that you are intermediate-level at R and Python without (it looks like) having any work or course experience in either language (hint: as an employer I would be slightly suspicious of this, enough that I would make sure to work R/Python questions into our interview).  It doesn't look like your work experiences/internships have been data related thus far. And that's OK because you clearly have data chops, but I imagine some hiring managers are going to question your interest in data analysis. I don't think you need very much help when it comes to skills building, to me it looks like you need to be doing a really good job of convincing employers that you are passionate about data analysis, and really good at finding jobs to apply for. Here are some tips for these:     Practice your ""story,"" or how all of your courses/experiences have brought you to the conclusion that data analysis is your calling. Play up your course work and Python/R experience, and talk about how you realized that sales wasn't for you, but that the relational database work in your sales job has steered you back in the data analysis direction. You know what I'm getting at.  Make sure you're networking in addition to being diligent about finding jobs. If you're in a major metro area I think you can have luck applying to job boards as long as you tailor your cover letter with your ""story"" and include all of your skills that match the postings' keyboards. That said, entry-level jobs are tough because employers are getting a deluge of unqualified, straight-out-of-college candidates. Try setting up informational interviews via your college's page on LinkedIn. That page will let you sort alumni on LinkedIn by employer, title, industry, etc. It is amazing."
datascience,2nvsxv,DeltaPunch,4,Mon Dec 1 15:54:12 2014 UTC,"datakittenMEOW Posted the below in my post which was deleted.  That's a good question. The easiest way to break into data analysis from college would be to have a quantitative major. Computer science, statistics, and math are probably best. Other majors that expose you to quantitative analysis will do just fine. No matter what your major, try to take at least an intro-level statistics class, and a calculus class. If you have the time, getting up to Calculus 3 and taking linear algebra would be ideal. You can certainly go further down the math/stats track, but these classes are a great starting point. Consider taking at least your college's intro CS course, and if you have time try taking a data structures/algorithms course also. Most entry-level jobs are looking for students with some experience, typically an internship or a research assistant position. If you have a CS/stats/math degree you can probably get away without doing an internship, if you aren't majoring in any of these (I didn't) try really hard to get some sort of data analysis internship. You likely won't be doing any sort of intensive analysis, most likely it will be data cleaning and such, but any experience you can get that exposes you to data will help you build experience. Really think about why you are interested in data analysis. The problem with entry-level jobs is they usually are flooded with applicants, most of whom don't have the requisite experience. Stand out from the crowd by taking the time to consider why you are interested in data analysis, and how your courses/experiences, etc. all have led you towards this career path."

My impressions: Most data science groups care much more about talent and entrepreneurial spirit than about credentials. There is also a huge demand for minimally qualified data scientists. If you are smart, pick up the skills (all of which can be self taught), and have the right attitude, you can make the transition from basically anything to data science.  Many data science roles involve a strong emphasis on communicating with non-technical partners. Be prepared for this if you are going for that sort of role.  Different econ groups do different things. I built models so, statistically, was well prepared for the transition. I would expect that many economists would have a highly transferable stats background.  Most data science groups expect a higher level level of technical expertise  than my old group. The quantitative maturity you gained with STATA and excel is great but, as skills, they will not count for much and the ability to get up and running with BI tools will be expected.  My advice: spend some time looking at the sorts of groups you will be applying to and the skills they are looking for. Use this survey as a starting point for what you need to learn.   Do yourself a favor and get comfortable with data analysis in R and/or Python (they are pretty interchangeable skillets). Depending on the groups you end up with you will be working on time series analysis, a/b testing, classification/regression models. Spending a bit of time brushing up on the stats necessary to do this sort of stuff and implementing some toy examples in R/Python will be worth you time.  Depending on the group you end up with and what you are aiming to do, Hadoop (or one of the relatives) will be a key skillset. You can pick this up and set up a toy 'cluster' locally or with a cheap AWS setup.  Depending on your group, real skills with software engineering might be desired. If so, spend some time with Java, Scala, or C++ (if you are experienced with one, you are hirable for jobs that require pretty much any other if you have experience doing the right things).  Depending on your group, Javascripts (and specifically D3) might be a worthwhile skill-set.  Coursera and Kaggle.com are great resources and come up positively in many of my interviews.  Many people use Agile so read a bit about it.  Many people use AWS so read a bit about it.  Lambda architecture (especially the streaming side of it), Spark, and things like deep-learning are sexy topics at the moment. I like to hire people who are interested in cool shit.  Spend some time specializing in the skills you want to use (some combination of the above should be part of this), find a group that will value this combination, and profit!  Feel free to PM."

datascience,2nuxd4,egocogito,3,Mon Dec 1 00:48:50 2014 UTC,"I had a reasonable stats and coding background from studying physics and picked up some Java and objective-C doing Econ so teaching myself enough to make myself marketable and interviewable was not too difficult.  There are a bunch of really great free resources out there. I really like Coursera and Kaggle. Prior to applying for jobs I went through Ng's ML course (Fantastic intro class: https://www.coursera.org/course/ml), intro to data science course (which is a great, gentle intro to a bunch of relevant stuff and a good starting point for self directed further learning: https://www.coursera.org/course/datasci ). I have since done the Functional Programming with Scala course and highly recommend it as well if that is your thing (https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun). Finally there is a data science track that might be an other good starting point for you: https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1 .  Kaggle is also a great place to get some experience with ML (and especially with python). The discussion forums tend to have startup solutions and a bunch of helpful people.   Finally, I have spent a bunch of time just googeling stuff that interests me and hacking together projects. There are lots of great code examples and tutorials out there which make for good starting points.  I did not go through any of the boot camps. I think insight is great and know someone who went through it (it is a fellowship program): http://www.bootcamps.in/san-francisco/insight-data-science/ . I also know some of the zipfian/galvanize and I think this is a viable option.  I honestly think that teaching yourself is a pretty good litmus test as to whether or not it is worth your while to make the jump. If you can get to the point where you are hirable through your own initiative, that is a pretty good indication that you belong in the industry. Its obviously a safer/less expensive option as well but possibly more difficult."

Cynicism aside, I do think that, like with many jobs, good experience or strong projects can set you up for a data science position without an advanced degree. Data science also isn't a very well defined field, honestly. Some data scientists mostly build plumbing and data cleaning services for their company, some do academic-style research with teams of PhDs, most probably do something in-between.   You say you're a long way from your degree, I say try your best to get a DS internship your Junior year and a job after graduation. Give it your best shot.

I may be wrong though... That said, internships are good to differentiate yourself from the academic world. In every interview I had to answer, ""So you have your PhD in Economics, what brings you to (insert company here)?"" and it was flavored in a manner like I'm an academic who doesn't understand business.   I'm a big fan of finding individual projects to work on. Kaggle has tons of data sets to play around with and use to hone your data wrangling, visualization, and machine learning.   I was hired for my job as a data analyst mainly in the predictive modeling space by submitting an answer to the 'data mining challenge' at my company's website. Maybe that's something to look into."

I also came from an academic background and I've also run into this bias in interviews. It seems common - the idea that ""academics"" don't understand or care about the real-world problems and needs of a business. I think it's kind of offensive but it's there regardless, and you have to overcome it to convince them that you can actually operate in a business environment that's focused on fast, effective results that help the bottom line.  Your 'data mining challenge' submission seems to have done that in your case."
datascience,2ni9e9,bailey_jameson,3,Thu Nov 27 00:51:02 2014 UTC,"They probably have been trained by interviewees that this is a fair assumption to make. I've met so many credentialed people who can't think their way out of a box. If you can, I'd suggest re-marketing yourself a bit. Do a project on something general interest or outside of your field, and put it on the internet. De-emphasize your academic background on your resume and deconstruct your experience into skills (technical and soft) that are applicable to your new deal. But don't stress to hard about the resume.   If you don't want the academic bias, try not to lean too hard on your academic credentials to open doors. We're trained to believe it's the only thing that gives us worth, and so we sound weird when we come out of the tower and try to talk to humans. Then again, it all depends on what you want to do and how you want to be treated. If you want to be the nerd in a corner office pulling a big salary and left alone for anything other than the hard quant parts, that could work.

datascience,2ni9e9,BoojumG,5,Sat Nov 29 01:49:26 2014 UTC,"I was a computational neuroscience PhD in the same boat. It was definitely difficult to get my foot in the door, but then once I found a job, it was easy to excel and now I'm in a Director position.   A few random thoughts: Internships would be great. They show that you excel in a non-academic setting. The best case would be to intern at a company you want to work at. Rock the internship, add some value, and they will want to hire you when you're done.  I didn't do insight or any other training program. I think it would be useful though, so if you can get in, do it. In my talks with someone who reviews applicants for them, they require you to have a non-academic project (kaggle, etc) already when you apply. I guess they get so many people that the bar is pretty high.   If you can interview with other PhDs or at a company that employees lots of PhDs, do it. They will understand the value of the degree. Places without any other PhDs sometimes reject you as being too academic. On the same note, be sure to not come across that way in any interview.   Once I knew I was leaving academia I started auditing machine learning and advanced mathematics courses at my school. This helped tremendously. We did cool projects and I learned so much new math and distributed computing techniques.   One last thing, if your main programming language is MATLAB or ::shudder:: fortran, pick up Python or at minimum, R."
datascience,2ni9e9,squirreltalk,3,Thu Nov 27 14:30:13 2014 UTC,"Like you said, you'd want to be sure that an internship would cover the things you want to develop as skills. A rather broad category of tasks get lumped under ""data science"", some of which wouldn't benefit you. One that's mostly simpler forms of business intelligence might not be a good fit for instance (generating graphs that tell executives what's going on in their company). That might not even involve any serious analysis or model-building, though IMO it should.   My background was a doctorate in physics that was focused on modeling/simulation/analysis, and I then transitioned to data science afterwards because I also didn't want to take a postdoc in my field. But it took some time to switch over. I think you're right on target with the ""databases, machine learning, and in general working with data"" focus. It sounds like you want to be the guy that really analyses data and builds useful models/algorithms that perform useful tasks and/or make concrete decision recommendations, not just a guy who's good at doing database queries and graphing the results with not much analysis and no predictive modeling involved.   I didn't find an opportunity to do a data science oriented internship before landing my first data science job, but I think it's a great idea. Coming from academia and shifting sideways in fields a bit, the hardest part IMO is convincing people you can perform successfully in the new field and are putting effort into it, and an internship can supply that.  One of the best things I did in switching over was finding a local group of people interested in data science and/or machine learning. In my area there are several Meetup groups focused on data science and/or machine learning that meet about once a month for someone to make an educational presentation and then for everyone to talk and network. The Meetup groups have been very helpful, both for exposing me to useful tools, methods, and advances in the field, and for connecting me with other professionals and enthusiasts. I'd highly recommend going to meetup.com and seeing if any such group exists in your area.  As an introduction to machine learning I really enjoyed Andrew Ng's course on Coursera. It's a solid introduction to various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.  Whatever you do, get some hands-on experience with data science and machine learning. It doesn't have to be in an official internship necessarily, but get your hands dirty with some personal projects at least. You'll learn a lot.  On a related note, I just found this blog post from a neuroscientist-turned-data-scientist musing on what a data scientist is and reflecting on his background a bit:  http://datascopeanalytics.com/what-we-think/2014/02/05/what-is-a-data-scientist  EDIT: Oh, and in general, throwing your resumes at online job postings has an extremely low success rate. I'm not saying don't do it, but make sure you're also doing all you can to network. Getting an interview from knowing a guy who knows a guy whose company is hiring is far, far more productive than just sending in a resume, especially if you don't look like an absolutely perfect candidate for the job on paper, which would involve basically already having done the exact thing they want you to do."

datascience,2ni9e9,jreacher,1 point,Sun Dec 7 20:06:51 2014 UTC,"Singular they:       Singular *they_ is the use of they, or its inflected or derivative forms, such as them, their, or themselves, to refer to a single person or an antecedent that is grammatically singular. It typically occurs with an antecedent of indeterminate gender, as in sentences such as:   ""Everyone returned to their seats.""  ""Somebody left their umbrella in the office. Would they please collect it?""  ""The patient should be told at the outset how much they will be required to pay.""  ""But a journalist should not be forced to reveal their sources.""    A reason for its use is that English has no dedicated singular personal pronoun of indeterminate gender.  In some cases, its use can be explained by notional agreement because words like ""everyone"", though singular in form, are plural in meaning.  Its use in formal English has increased in recent times with the trend toward gender-inclusive language,  but it has been used by respected writers for centuries.   Though singular they has a long history of usage and is common in everyday English, its use has been criticized since the late nineteenth century, and acceptance varies.

datascience,2nhb4k,rscottking73,7,Wed Nov 26 14:40:07 2014 UTC,"I have been asked (and often ask myself) a simple application of Bayesian statistics. I think of it as FizzBuzz for data science. Basically something like: imagine a test with a true positive rate of 1 and false positive rate of 5%. Imagine a population with a 1/1000 rate of having the condition the test identifies. Given a positive test, what is the probability of having that condition?   I have been asked how I would build a classifier to determine the gender of a Twitter user given the corpus of their tweets.   I have been asked how I would monitor a disease outbreak with Twitter.   A simple programming question is common as well."
datascience,2nhb4k,WallyMetropolis,1 point,Wed Nov 26 15:51:57 2014 UTC,"cool!   Out of curiousity, for the gender classifier, how in depth was your answer (or the depth that was expected)?  I really like the monitoring question! I think I'd break it down into three parts: data-collection (query twitter API), processing (munge that text), and presentation (web-map)."
datascience,2nhb4k,yumSalmon,3,Wed Nov 26 17:50:38 2014 UTC,"My answer was relatively detailed. I talked about how I would go about obtaining a good training set, how I would process the text data (e.g. tokenization, stop words, stemming, n-grams, dealing with @mentions, hashtags, emoticons), what classification methods I would try first and why, and how I would measure the quality of the classifier."
datascience,2nhb4k,WallyMetropolis,1 point,Wed Nov 26 18:06:54 2014 UTC,"It'd be really cool if you could explain the last part, the whys of the classification methods and the quality measurements for it!"
datascience,2nhb4k,sloby,2,Mon Dec 1 02:41:10 2014 UTC,"Well, I suggested an SVM because it can easily handle a huge dimensional feature space with varied feature types (text, metadata from the profile, timestamps) and it's naturally a binary classifier.   As a first pass for validation, I'd make a training set out of profiles with names listed in some big list of male and female names. Apply cross-fold validation. Withhold a knockout set, make some confusion matrixes, some ROC curves. Nothing super exotic."
datascience,2nhb4k,WallyMetropolis,6,Mon Dec 1 03:03:14 2014 UTC,"I always pick something off the resume that I know a lot about and ask questions to get an understanding of the depth of the knowledge. You know linear regression? Show me the simple equation. What if the matrix isn't full rank? What should we do with null values, what about elastic net regularization, etc? Python? Tell me about list comprehension, generators, pandas, sklearn, etc. You made a model to infer Twitter gender on your resume? How would you scale it to a million people, a billion, live streaming data? How did you train it, how do you periodically check it's valid? What modeling framework did you use and can you explain it at a high level? What about a mathematical one?  Basically, TLDR: if it's on your résumé I'm going to hound you about it. You put it there so it's fair game. I don't expect people to be able to answer everything I think of, but by asking these questions I know the detailed skill levels of my candidates pretty quickly."
datascience,2nf512,Turin_Martell,4,Tue Nov 25 22:52:08 2014 UTC,"Yes, but be aware of his motivations. It's difficult to hire for certain technical positions and the salaries are fairly high. Recruiters get paid some percentage of the salary that an employee signs for (it doesn't come out of the employee's check, it just sets the amount the recruiter is paid).  Recruiters can be unscrupulous: if they can get someone hired to a job they're not really qualified for, they still get their check. So for a gig like Data Science, they will basically try to contact anyone they can find who they might be able to source.   So the upshot is, he may very well find some positions for you to apply to. But he also won't really care if it's a good fit or if it's something you'd actually want to do.   After you get a little experience you'll find that you'll get about 10 emails from recruiters each week. Most of those will be for roles that have nothing to do whatsoever with your actual experience or interests."
datascience,2nf512,WallyMetropolis,3,Wed Nov 26 02:14:00 2014 UTC,"Just to add another point... not all recruiters have jobs lined up for their candidates.  I get 1-2 calls per month from recruiters pitching me on candidates they have that they think might be a good fit for the company I work for.  I'm not a hiring manager, and while I do have influence over who gets hired... I'm not somebody a recruiter should be cold calling.  For newer recruiters, it's a chicken/egg problem... so, they sell the candidates on jobs they don't have, and they sell companies on candidates they don't have... and they just hope that by the time both have sign on, they can line everything up correctly.  So, be careful.  If it's an external recruiter or headhunter, be wary.  If they want you remove your contact information from your resume, or heavily modify your work history, just say no and walk away.  On the other hand, if they are an internal recruiter (e.g., work for facebook or apple), are contracted, or are a VC firm recruiting for their portfolio, then go for it."

However, I'd absolutely advise setting up a Github account and running through your work."
datascience,2n9uxf,jobseekingturtle,8,Mon Nov 24 16:20:02 2014 UTC,"I would say no.  Here's why - most people will not know what DataCamp is, nor will they know what it does, nor will they know what you learned, nor will they know why it matters to the job you are applying, nor will they know what you studied, nor will they know how well you learned it, nor will they know in-depth / broad the curriculum was.  However, if you put down (to DJ_InsideVoice!'s point)    A project you worked on Describing what you did How you did it What tools you used What techniques you used What data you used What types of modeling you did What you learned Put a link to GitHub and/or a blog write up And maybe, but perhaps not, mention that you learned it by studying at datacamp.com   THEN, and only then, is it going to be taken seriously by someone looking at your resume."

I, personally, think it shows initiative and dedication, which is a definite pro.  However, those courses are often less rigorous than similar courses taught at a university.  So, I don't think we're quite at a point where taking free (or cheap) online courses is a substitute for college education.  However, depending on your dedication and the specifics of the kind of job you're looking for, you might end up being very well qualified.  In my opinion, one of the biggest benefits of online programs is providing direction for completing independent data projects.  Your best bet would be polishing those off into a really kick-ass portfolio, rather than relying on course completion certificates.  tl;dr: I don't think it hurts (particularly if you have additional university coursework), but you may be better off showcasing course projects."

datascience,2n6gs0,whiteraven2,7,Sun Nov 23 17:27:42 2014 UTC,Any discussion of Poisson regression should really point out that one of its assumptions (mean=variance) is quite frequently violated.  It is a good starting point for count data but something usually has to be done to handle overdispersion.
datascience,2n6gs0,Btentaculata,1 point,Sun Nov 23 18:37:30 2014 UTC,Any suggested techniques?
datascience,2n6gs0,timClicks,1 point,Sun Nov 23 23:03:49 2014 UTC,Usually when the assumptions of a Poisson distribution are violated my next step is a negative binomial regression (the MASS package in R has this).  I'm sure there are other approaches that can be taken but negative binomial usually works for the types of data I work with.
datascience,2n6gs0,Btentaculata,1 point,Sun Nov 23 23:32:52 2014 UTC,How often is poisson regression used? First time ive ever heard of it
datascience,2n6w9z,jobseekingturtle,3,Sun Nov 23 19:56:49 2014 UTC,"Learn how to use a visualization package or two and maybe put together a web app to show off your skills. If you know R, I would suggest Shiny along with the ShinyApps service. It's really not too difficult. For example, I made this app with ShinyApps, although I did the actual data analysis using the Python library scikit-learn. Another good visualization package is ggplot2.  If you know Python, I suggest bokeh for making web apps. There's also seaborn and matplotlib for general plotting.   Regarding what to actually do for a project, I'd say just try to think of some topic that you find personally interesting, hunt down some data, and try to answer some questions that you think would be interesting to understand. Try not to make it about anything too obscure, as you want potential employers to be able to understand it immediately."

datascience,2n68o8,poopyheadthrowaway,3,Sun Nov 23 16:00:06 2014 UTC,"I think it may just be a lack of standardization, or slowness to adopt the title of ""data scientist."" After all, people have been in job roles like this since before the term ""data science"" was popular.   For example, I just left a project where we were building a recommender. There was a guy on that team who did exclusively tasks that we would call data science: cleaning data, choosing what variables to model from, designing visualizations, etc. His job title is something like ""Senior solutions architect."" No programming background except SAS; he's clearly a Data Scientist, but our HR dept. hasn't caught up with that trend.  TL;DR - if it quacks like a Data Scientist, and gets paid like a Data Scientist..."
datascience,2n68o8,crediblecat,3,Sun Nov 23 16:21:22 2014 UTC,"Any title or job description with ""Business intelligence"" in it concerns me.  I've seen those positions end up as glorified report writers, where you're just feeding data to some underqualified director to take credit for your work.  However, I think it depends on where you're looking for a job.  If you're in the bay area, and there's a ""data analyst"" or ""business intelligence developer"" position, I would run away.  However, if it's the same title in the midwest or south, then I think you should ask a bunch of questions about what the specific job function is, and proceed if it's in line with your expectations."
datascience,2n68o8,not-a-ginger,1 point,Sun Nov 23 16:41:49 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I have some similar concerns, too. From what I've read on forums and such, ""business intelligence"" is just reporting and writing data. At the same time, the recruiters I've talked to said you need a strong stats and data mining background and the job involves a lot of analytics and model building (although in my experience recruiters aren't always honest).

datascience,2n40n1,watersign,2,Sat Nov 22 21:59:28 2014 UTC,"The answer to your title question is 'no'. It's not a 'required skill', plenty of data scientists will never do NLP.  As far as your question is concerned, however, I'd go with NLP. Anything you learn in a class on making web and mobile apps will be outdated in six months, whereas you can pick up a simple framework from a language you know, e.g Django from Python, and get from zero to sixty in a weekend. If you do find you need to learn GIS, go learn GIS by playing around with QGIS or help us out with the Ebola data project. NLP, on the other hand, will teach you to think and reason about communication, its mathematical theory (if your course does not make you read Shannon, read it anyway!), its analysis and, of course, the now fashionable area of 'unstructured data'.  TL;DR: go with the NLP course."

datascience,2n40n1,shaggorama,2,Sat Nov 22 21:34:59 2014 UTC,"There are basically two sides to this:   Many ""data scientists"" are generalists (myself included). For these people, some basic NLP will probably be important and may frequently be useful. Many data scientists are specialists. If these people need NLP, they'll know it.   In deciding which class to take, I think you should ask yourself two questions: ""is this topic interesting to me?"" and ""is this topic new to me?"" Pick your class based on how you answer these questions.   NLP is definitely useful, but so is GIS. App development isn't something you're going to really need as a data scientist."
datascience,2n40n1,zwartwater,0,Sun Nov 23 04:11:45 2014 UTC,"Not sure I entirely agree with your distinction between ""generalists"" and ""specialists"": it's all about interest, ability and opportunity. So, if you are interested in NLP, or need it for a project, then you're going to read up on it. Still, you will need to have the necessary mathematical background to understand it and the necessary programming background to actually use it.  And if you're a data scientist you should be able to create data products; so mobile and/or web application development should be in your toolbox."
datascience,2n40n1,chrisvoncsefalvay,3,Sun Nov 23 09:31:06 2014 UTC,"Ultimately, spend some years in a role and it will start to determine your profile. If you spend all day crunching pricing data for a prop trading desk, you probably won't be able to keep up with whatever's new in, say, NLP... unless you have the time, resources and stamina to spend your spare time doing data science, too. You can have all the interest and ability in the world (I don't believe in opportunity in this area, everything's on the bloody internet!), you will inevitably be what your role(s) demand you to be. If your role demands you to be a generalist, you're going to be a generalist with a few strong suits. If your role demands you to be a specialist, you'll be a specialist."

datascience,2myhbt,dsforme,7,Fri Nov 21 05:20:43 2014 UTC,"Your best bet is to try and talk to some graduates of the bootcamp to get a feel for the experience and job prospects after graduating (I'd personally contact them through LinkedIn, etc. Don't get references from Zipfian Academy). 12 weeks isn't long enough to master anything, but it can certainly get you on track towards becoming a data scientist assuming that the program is legit.  As far as cost goes, 16k is obviously a LOT of money. And if you're looking at housing in San Francisco, you're going to have to pay about 1k/month in rent (minimum) to share a room with at least 1 other person (probably 2) if you want to stay in the city, and a little less the further away from the city you go, but of course that means a longer commute, which is going to be a little more draining, especially since bootcamps typically have really long hours. Fortunately, commuting in and out of the city from the east bay isn't too difficult if you stay near a BART/Caltrain station.  I can tell you that if you expect to learn everything you need to know to get hired in the short timeframe of the bootcamp, you'll be severely disappointed. Any bootcamp that says otherwise is flat out lying to you. What these bootcamps can do is give you a really solid foundation for future learning, but you'll have to determine for yourself if that's worth the cost of attending. Make sure you're really committed and passionate about data science. The point of a high quality bootcamp is not to teach you everything you need to know to break into a field, but rather to give you the skills, resources, and confidence to continue learning after the bootcamp is over.  If I were you, I'd look through the curriculum and see if you can't teach yourself some of these concepts on your own through online courses or reading. If you don't have the time to learn on your own (which is totally understandable), you really feel passionate about data science, and graduates speak well of their experience and the foundation of knowledge the program delivers, then this might be a good course of action for you to break into the field. Look into coursera's data science track, it's got some pretty solid material to get you started learning data science.  Hope this helps! I know it's a big decision. Some people will bash bootcamps, and that's because immersive bootcamps are really trendy right now and there are a lot of them popping up that are less concerned with producing developers (in your case data scientists) and more concerned about making a profit. There are really legit bootcamps out there that produce high quality graduates, but attending a bootcamp won't get you a job anywhere, that's the honest truth.   There's a great quote from the Dev Bootcamp founder (I know I know, not data science, but I believe is still relevant) about how people going into a bootcamp can approach their time in the program two ways... they will either have a kitchen or a restaurant mentality. The restaurant mentality is that you pay a certain price, and you get exactly what the menu states. Everyone who orders the dish gets the same exact thing and will have the same exact experience. The kitchen mentality is that you are the chef. You have the ingredients at your disposal to make whatever you want. If there is a hair in the dish, it's your responsibility to take it out and fix things, no one else is going to hold your hand and do it for you. The point is, if this bootcamp does have quality teachers and a quality cirriculum, it's still entirely up to you if it's going to be worth the pricetag of $16k.   Sorry for the lengthy post, but hopefully some of what I said will help you out in making your decision, because after all, the only person who can determine if this is a good program for you is you."

If data science is the path you want to take, you really need to get your hands dirty with some large data. When you are comfortable managing/cleaning/manipulating 10M+ instances across 300+ attributes (and even this is on the small side), then you get to really immerse yourself in the models and have some fun :)  When u/DJ_InsideVoice says scalable models, I think he/she is referring to models that utilize machine learning techniques to resolve errors and even enhance model performance as new data is introduced into the schema. A wide-scale model that can be successful for many years (through automatic self-assessment) is an extremely valuable model. Data scientists often joke that their job is to automate themselves out of a job.  Out of curiosity, what are you using to generate decision trees? Do you have an VBA experience? SAS? R?"

Even with just this certificate, would I be able to apply to data scientist jobs?  It depends on your definition of ""Data Scientist,"" but the answer is probably no. Don't take this the wrong way, I think a certificate will help you convince an employer that you are interested in data analysis, and I think it will help you get an entry-level Data Scientist job. Titles common to these types of jobs are Data Analyst, Research Analyst, Research Associate, Analyst, Junior Data Analyst, etc. Your duties will mostly be in data munging, with the occasional analysis project thrown in. Just don't expect to go right from a certificate to being a full-fledged Data Scientist. I only have my BA, and am working as a Data Analyst right now. My goal is to go back to school in the next 2-4 years once I am sure that this is the career path that is going to make me happy for the rest of my life, and then start applying for true Data Science jobs.   I'm trying to determine whether something like this is useful outside of data scientist jobs as well?  Let me start off with a couple of online certifications to look into, 1) the Johns Hopkins Data Science track, and 2) the brand new Udacity Data Analyst nanodegree. Neither of these will make you a Data Scientist, but each will help improve your programming, data, and statistics skills, and will help convince employers than you are interested in working with data.  I'm taking courses in the former, and one nice thing is that it forces you to put most of your projects up on GitHub, so it automatically helps you create a portfolio of work to show to employers.  I could see many of the skills gained from these certifications being useful outside of Data Scientist roles. It sounds like you do not have a programming background (forgive me if I am wrong), so the most useful takeaway for you is probably going to be a more rigorous focus on programming. Programming can help you in many IT-related career pathways other than Data Science. There are a slew of other skills that you will pick up as you would in taking any college courses, such as critical thinking, time management, etc. but I won't go into these.    You remind me of myself just a few months ago. Consider taking some online courses, even if it's just to see whether or not they pique any additional interest in data analysis. Who knows where that will take you. I will definitely be going back for an advanced degree at some point, but I think starting off with online courses or a certificate is a great idea in the meantime. Best of luck :) !"

However, MIC is implemented on pairs of variables (my hunch is a mutual-information based metric on larger sets of variables would require a huge amount of data).  The paper below addresses the overfitting,and recommends brownian distance covariance as an alternative  http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/reshef/comment.pdf  Again with sufficient data, neural networks do a good job of finding complex non-linear features that are important.    In biology, where you almost always have very limited N, I think the best option almost always is (sadly) to start with a good prior / intuition about the problem and work from there.

For example, if you're trying to detect whether visitors can't find the content they're looking for (say in order to modify the site design), then you'd like to know the order in which they clicked things -- a transition matrix will probably be pretty bad for this kind of thing.    The idea of reducing to this Markovian setup is appealing, though -- it simplifies things a lot, and is less computationally demanding than examining the full path.  If you don't get good/useful results initially, I would try first crudely clustering the visitors into types using ""full path"" information, then computing transition matrices within each cluster.  The transition matrix approach might be useful within a fixed ""type"" (though it still seems like it would perform poorly in the ""lost visitor"" example above).     Anyway, those are just some vague thoughts (it's especially unclear what kind of clustering would be useful, probably depends on the specific situation), good luck!"
datascience,2m63l2,clunk_pail,1 point,Thu Nov 13 11:31:39 2014 UTC,Thanks for your answer. Maybe a circular representation of the matrix could be insightful to describe paths. Something like this http://data2papers.wordpress.com/2014/07/04/circular-graph/ .
datascience,2m63l2,munky86,2,Thu Nov 13 12:14:32 2014 UTC,"Please don't use that circular thing. You can not really see anything in it. Just use a proper graph. There are a lot of good layout algorithms out there you could use for visualization. You could use the thickness of the edges as an indicator for the transition probability that someone follows the link. I quickly created a simple example what i mean. the red node indicates the main page.  You could also use tools of network analysis to analyze your graph. For example if there are a lot of long paths that are highly frequented, you might consider to add an extra link.  This is all just from the top of my head, but if you want i can elaborate a bit more."
