Aside from the legion of other issues with healthcare.  For a business, health care expense is pre-tax.  $100 spent on health insurance for an employee is a $100 reduction in taxable income.  For an individual it is post tax.  Well it depends.  Depends on which  byzantine level of bureaucratic hell one finds themselves.  So it may be no deduction.  It may be a net gain of $10.  This may even land one in hot water with fines and interest.  Who knows.  Have to file the tax return to find out.  Not really a method of future financial planning.  Shouldn't health care not be a function of which job one holds?  Why should someone worry about losing a job and health care at the same time?  I mean my homeowner's insurance is not tied to my job.  Neither is my car insurance or any other kind of insurance.  Seems unnecessarily complex.  Edit:  Holy crap I miswrote that.  Should have said:    According to the article and in summary Uber provides jobs but they are bad jobs cause they don't come with benefits etc.  I personally think Uber is amazing and I love seeing monopolistic force driven entities die from their own internal rot.  Much like taxi cab companies and their limiting competition through government."
libertarianmeme,3d6146,seattleandrew,8,Mon Jul 13 22:15:22 2015 UTC,"Uber provides jobs but they are bad jobs cause they don't come with benefits etc.   But do Taxi drivers actually get benefits? In Seattle, no they don't. On top of that, they need to own or lease their car, which they can't use for non-business purposes. At least with Uber, the car is theirs, on the clock and off.  What you're getting to is the crux on why healthcare in America is broken. Everyone is tossing around numbers of how many more people are insured since the ACA was passed, but insurance coverage shouldn't be our metric for healthcare.  No healthcare and access to healthcare shouldn't be tied to a job. Health care should be available to everyone, health insurance should be available to those that insurance companies are willing to accept. We've managed to mangle the idea of who should pay for your medical bills. It shouldn't be the government, it shouldn't be your employer, it should be you. Now we can talk about pre-existing conditions and income imbalances if you want to, but really I think the point is.  Taxi drivers have shitty jobs"

libertarianmeme,3d6146,bff_T_fishbine,10,Tue Jul 14 03:54:28 2015 UTC,According to the article: good jobs have health benefits.  Uber drivers are 1099 contractors and don't have employer provided healthcare benefits.  Ergo (according to the article and the democratic front runner) contract jobs are less desirable.  Why?  Another instance of government trying to fix a problem that they created.  The tax system is such that health benefits are less expensive when provided by a company as opposed to an individual.  The healthcare market is skewed toward companies.  Meanwhile the new normal in employment is trending toward contract labor.

Many flags are similar to others but there is no stigma attached to flags that are similar to the rebel flag, just the rebel flag. And to your last point, you can't judge a past society on the moral standards of today because they are very well remembered people including a few founding fathers who would be considered monsters today. And yes it does alter the point because if you judge the Southern US of that time by the moral standards of that time they are well within the mathematical norm. Abolition was a relatively new movement at this time and the South was going to have a government they didn't agree with force rules they didn't want to follow upon them with no consideration for them. Sound familiar? Also freeing the slaves would have crippled the South, and it did during Reconstruction along with the war crime that was the March to the Sea."

Trying to say they are so different it renders the comparison mute is disingenuous.   Point of history still isn't relevant. Sure some people think themselves superior then past generations because they stand on the shoulder of giants, but that's not this conversation. The flag represents a group of people who succeeded to fight for slavery. Continuing to support said flag is continuing to support their cause. At least to many.   As my original point, Nazi flag and all that. Your argument could still apply there. Genocide has happened for all of history and only really since WWII has the world stood against it.   Believe the pope even point it out, why didn't the allies bomb the rail lines to the camps. Could have and that would have slowed down the murders. But it wasn't high enough on the to do list."

And point of history is relevant because calling a group of people evil because they did something that was common practice at the time is wrong. And the CSA fought for state's rights. It was state's rights to own slaves but it was more about a government that didn't represent them trying to force them to give up their entire livelihood. And once again you're tiptoeing on the Godwin's Fallacy. The difference between the CSA and the Nazi's is the CSA wanted to keep slaves which was a common accepted practice worldwide at the time. The Nazi's committed mass genocide which while it was a common practice, it hasn't been a socially acceptable practice for a millennia. I'm not saying that the CSA wasn't wrong by today's standards I'm just saying that they don't deserve the vilification they receive because there is revisionist history on how the CSA was the last and worst slave state, neither of which is true."

But this whole convo wasn't about whether the soldiers were bad people, it was about a flag and what connotation it holds.   I've read, no source, that only 5% of southerners owned slaves, so there is that argument too. Just like how most of Germany's soldiers weren't some Jew hater. Many were forced to fight or their families would suffer. Plus they were literally starving to death and Hitler brought them back to life.   Genocide may not have had the support, but most of the worst ones in history occur between the great wars but no one stopped them.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genocides_by_death_toll"

And you're right I didn't mean to hijack the conversation I just hate when people vilify the South and consider Southern people to all be stupid racist rednecks.

libertarianmeme,3c3xgr,jdepps113,8,Sat Jul 4 17:46:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  What's interesting is that some of the framers, including Washington and Madison, argued against the notion of a 'bill of rights' being attached to the Constitution, maintaining that we have innumerable rights; indeed, it was commonly understood that Fed Gov was on a very tight leash, being merely Vested with the enumerated powers listed in Artricle One, Section 8.  They believed by adding the ""Bill of Rights"" listing a few specific rights of the people was not only redundant but also potentially very dangerous.    So, out of precaution, the 9th and 10th amendments were included in that short list to reinforce the liberty of the individual and the sovereignty of the states, which created the fed gov.  Surely, this relative safeguard would be sufficient for future generations and ensured nobody would be confused, right? RIGHT? Nope. Alas, over time, gradual encroachment by the gov in times of emergency, in the name of public safety or ""general welfare"" or social justice, or because it offends someone, etc, our natural, infinite rights have been eroded by the relentless onslaught of statism.  This coupled with the systematic dumbing down of the populace has left us, ironically, clinging for dear life to the now nearly toothless words of the first 10 amendments.    Imagine if we did not have this meager, redundant, literally paper-thin shield to help deflect most of the assaults on our liberty.  True, it has been circumvented and gutted and made largely powerless, but at least it is well known and thereby serves as an effective speed bump for tyrants."

Most states have voting over several days and extended polling hours, almost all have absentee ballots that you can receive just by asking and vote weeks in advance by mail. One state even has only absentee voting.   If you can't make one of the days or request an absentee ballot, you're not really committed to voting and probably don't know jack about any of the issues."

Choosing to vote on the specified voting day is not evidence that you 'know jack about the issues' and regardless, knowing 'jack about the issues' is not a reason to have your vote denied.   Organising, sending out and managing tens of millions of extra absentee ballots is a far greater task than simply having the election on a weekend where you're spending the same resources and time you would have spent on Tuesday anyway."

I'm a moderate conservative (albeit an Aussie, where our voting is compulsory) yet even I don't understand why Tuesday should stay just on the basis of tradition.   Weekends are better, national holidays are even better, and it adapts elections to the habits of voters, whereby the majority want to vote in person and lots of them get stuck in a mad rush to the booths before and after work."

If the office of President were constrained to its constitutional bounds, I probably wouldn't mind taking a turn with crazy uncle Bernie as our chief ambassador.  Yes, Ron Paul was also an outsider, but he was an outsider for believing the Constitution meant what it said. Sanders, when it comes to the ideas that create his platform, is no different from any garden variety left-Democrat. What makes him an ""outsider"" is that he won't keep his trap shut about those ideas. The other Democrats know better than to let their totalitarian/Marxist side show too clearly. This actually makes him extra scary. Unlike most of the powerful people in Washington, who got their vaguely leftist ideology by osmosis and don't think about it much, Bernie is a true believer. He actually thinks someone's economic success necessarily deprives others, and it's his job to play Robin Hood and fix it."

Good people want their organization under scrutiny because if they're good people doing good things scrutiny will only confirm that and disseminate the information."

I'm certain there are fantastic human beings who are also cops.  I've even met some cops I liked.

First off, removing a flag from a capital and banning it are not the same thing in any way. It seems like the ten commandments are still legal, but we had those removed from the courthouse in Alabama.  Second, we don't have to always take sides against the left in some knee-jerk reaction. We aren't Republicans. Lots of issues actually don't involve an infringement of someone's liberty or act of aggression at all. You might still have an opinion about it, but don't try to pretend that opinion is the libertarian position when the issue at hand is largely irrelevant to libertarianism.  Last of all, it's being deliberately obtuse by acting like a symbol is static in meaning and never changes from it's original historical use. The swastika was originally a symbol for good fortune, but it would be completely asinine to act like people who object to the swastika are just being stupid - its meaning changed over time as a genocidal group of racists adopted it as their symbol. The confederate flag may not have originally been any more racist than the US flag, but the meanings attached to both of those symbols have evolved over time - the US flag gradually becoming less racist, and the confederate flag being adopted by segregationists, the KKK, and other hate groups. Ignoring 250 years of history since the end of the Civil War and trying to pretend that all symbols today are the exact same as back then - I mean I can't even fathom the stupidity it takes for an adult without mental handicaps to do that accidentally."

That said, Slavery is alive and well in the US:   I think it is more important to look at the issue as the private contracting of prisoners. Being held in a privately owned prison creates its own set of issues, but even state operated facilities contract their prisoners for labor for private profits. One study concluded:   the federal prison industry produces 100% of all military helmets, ammunition belts, bullet-proof vests, ID tags, shirts, pants, tents, bags, and canteens. Along with war supplies, prison workers supply 98% of the entire market for equipment assembly services; 93% of paints and paintbrushes; 92% of stove assembly; 46% of body armor; 36% of home appliances; 30% of headphones/microphones/speakers; and 21% of office furniture. Airplane parts, medical supplies, and much more   This means that the big money isn't necessarily generated by the incarceration (although that is also true), it is generated directly through the labor of those who are incarcerated - because they are paid essentially nothing to do jobs which are otherwise just as valuable as any other manufacturing job. This labor is contracted out to private companies:   Federal Prison Industries (FPI), a corporation owned by the federal government, employs more than 13,000 inmates at wages from 23 cents to $1.15 an hour   FPI is not a prison, or a prisoner management company like CCA - it is a company which employs prisoners, it generates private profits, it invests in new businesses, it builds buildings, it fills contracts, it primarily employs prison labor - guess how much that helps anybody outside of FPI:   operates inside 83 federal prisons and made more than $900 million in revenue last year.   This displaces other businesses because they cannot compete with workers who earn less than $5/day:   Tennier Industries, which also makes military clothing, fired more than 100 employees after losing out to FPI on a new $45 million contract   So, tax dollars used to be returned to the economy through federal contracts, such as defense spending, in the form of wages for the manufacturing workers who built the products that our soldiers use. Now, certain federal contracts (which have grown in value, not shrunk) are distributed almost exclusively to the owners of companies which employ prisoners - the tax dollars do not return to the economy through wages, rather they pad the bank accounts of executives and remain in the accounts of prisoners which are operated by their respective prison for the prisoner's benefit.  This is expanding outside of federal contract territory as well, American Apparel and Footwear, American Power Source, Ashland sale and Service, all these companies make consumer durables not designed for our military - they are all losing private contracts to federal prison labor."

Georgia: The people of Georgia having dissolved their political connection with the Government of the United States of America, present to their confederates and the world the causes which have led to the separation. For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery. They have endeavored to weaken our security, to disturb our domestic peace and tranquility, and persistently refused to comply with their express constitutional obligations to us in reference to that property, and by the use of their power in the Federal Government have striven to deprive us of an equal enjoyment of the common Territories of the Republic.  Mississippi: In the momentous step which our State has taken of dissolving its connection with the government of which we so long formed a part, it is but just that we should declare the prominent reasons which have induced our course.   Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin. That we do not overstate the dangers to our institution, a reference to a few facts will sufficiently prove.   South Carolina: The people of the State of South Carolina, in Convention assembled, on the 26th day of April, A.D., 1852, declared that the frequent violations of the Constitution of the United States, by the Federal Government, and its encroachments upon the reserved rights of the States, fully justified this State in then withdrawing from the Federal Union; but in deference to the opinions and wishes of the other slaveholding States, she forbore at that time to exercise this right. Since that time, these encroachments have continued to increase, and further forbearance ceases to be a virtue.   Texas: Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated Union to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquility and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. She was received into the confederacy with her own constitution, under the guarantee of the federal constitution and the compact of annexation, that she should enjoy these blessings. She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time. Her institutions and geographical position established the strongest ties between her and other slave-holding States of the confederacy. Those ties have been strengthened by association. But what has been the course of the government of the United States, and of the people and authorities of the non-slave-holding States, since our connection with them?   Virginia: The people of Virginia, in their ratification of the Constitution of the United States of America, adopted by them in Convention on the twenty-fifth day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight, having declared that the powers granted under the said Constitution were derived from the people of the United States, and might be resumed whensoever the same should be perverted to their injury and oppression; and the Federal Government, having perverted said powers, not only to the injury of the people of Virginia, but to the oppression of the Southern Slaveholding States.   I don't support slavery.   I know you don't. But this southern apologist or ""clean confederacy"" myth makes you sound ignorant to people who actually know the civil war and racist to those who don't.  Supporting the south is also against the fundamentals of libertariansim."

I think this strikes a good balance between open and honest due process rights and suspension thereof, and the allowance for the military to do their job.    With that preface, Qatar is a stout US ally, and it would be very difficult for Congress to authorize open season in that country; or require Congress to legislate geographic borders that allows US military action. This proposal should prevent US VIPs getting to galavant around in the same country that other US citizens are getting extra-judicially killed in."

Socializing those things is not my main concern with Sanders, rather that he wants to keep everything that exist, and add more things to the welfare-warfare state. For instance, the spending on the military industrial complex, war on terror and nation building could by themselves easily finance those things, and they would undoubtedly be more beneficial to the US citizens.  The problem in the US, the problem everywhere, is that nobody challenges the status quo and dares to downsize the government for real. I get that with libertarians, there is a certain bias against democrats, which is fair, but if we are blind to the policies of the GOP, and especially the policies that both parties agree on, we are offering zero solutions, and rather participate in the continuous shit-throwing. Honestly, I'd rather see a Bernie Sanders high on ""free money"", going crazy with his welfare programs if the rest of the government was managed properly (i.e. not managed) than continuing the political path the US is headed, independent of if the Bush or Clinton family rules the country."

The oil explains the discrepancy between Sweden and Norway, since we are very similar in almost every aspect. Despite our socialist policies we still have high standards of living, and a lot less (almost none) poverty than the US. That is why I claim that the problems as of today in the US cannot be blamed on welfare solely. The first point I had is that there are elephants in the room that the so-called libertarians need to acknowledge, programs that both parties and the GOP are protecting. The second point I was trying to make is that dollars spent on welfare benefit the people more than if spent on warfare."
libertarianmeme,3aoykb,betamos,0,Mon Jun 22 21:49:54 2015 UTC,"You're also forgetting that most of Europe spends very little on their military because they rely on the US to protect them.

libertarianmeme,3aoykb,Totenglocke42,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:29:59 2015 UTC,"Oil, military spending etc. they are insufficient explanations. Sweden is not even a NATO member, Sweden exchange intel for a loose clandestine promise that Sweden is included in the US ""sphere of interest"". The explanation behind Swedens rise to a ""welfare state"" lies in Swedens extraordinary industry after world war two. When other countries were in ruin, Sweden sold high quality materials to reconstruct Europe. Wood, steel, inventions, machinery, tools etc. Sweden bathed in relative wealth and the socialists could implement a whole bunch of programs. The crown was devalued five times to hold those programs afloat before the exchange rate was finally set free. Many socialist policies have been rolled back since then. Relative to the US I would argue that Sweden has the freer economy. The taxes are higher but there are fewer and less burdensome regulations and a much more efficient public sector overall (not saying it's efficient though). The ""free"" health care and school voucher systems are actually a lot like the ones Milton Friedman though the US should implement to mitigate the harm done by the government in those sectors. He didn't - and I don't either - believe that it is the perfect system but it is a lot better than what the US has in those areas. Did you know that the per capita government spending on healthcare is larger (almost twice!) in the United States than in Sweden? http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.PCAP"

libertarianmeme,390nzr,clay_target_clubs,8,Mon Jun 8 14:35:17 2015 UTC,"Just quick googling...  The Bond Yield Curve is the curve of how much people will buy Treasury (and other) Bonds for.  They are [sometimes] plotted logarithmically, with the X axis being (Log [but not in the one above, it seems]) duration of time that the bond is held for, and the Y axis being Rate of Return.    Normally, bonds with quick turnarounds (30 day bonds) won't get you as good a return on investment as longer term  ones.  This tends to have an increasing curve, indicating an aggregate belief (shown through the market price of bonds sold at auction) that the further out we're thinking, the more investment money elsewhere will be worth.  On the other hand, an inverted curve (the red line above) indicates that the aggregate belief is less optimistic, that they believe a smaller return on a long term investment is more reliable than putting money in stocks or similar over that same period of time.  The more people are worried about long term investments, the more people there are buying bonds, the higher the price (and thus the lower the yield) for 10+ year, $1,000 bonds."

This assumes they have perfect knowledge however and is one of the biggest criticisms of the theory.   I can't quite remember the Liquidity theory, but it was something along the lines that the demand for money will change these prices accordingly."
libertarianmeme,390nzr,dcman00000,2,Mon Jun 8 19:55:55 2015 UTC,ok thanks. Nice write up.
libertarianmeme,390nzr,clay_target_clubs,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:16:14 2015 UTC,I'm confused. How does the return on investment reflect what people are thinking? And why would it be bad if it inverts?
libertarianmeme,390nzr,Tetrabyte,6,Mon Jun 8 18:01:40 2015 UTC,"There are a few premises that we need to understand before I can explain this properly.   Investment income generally goes into one of two places, Stocks or Bonds. Stocks are a speculative return.  They might go up in value, they might go down. Bonds a guaranteed return, and are sold at Auction.  Each bond sale is basically the Issuer says ""How much money will you give me, right now, in exchange for me paying you $1,000 in 5 years?"" The price at auction is a function of how much money is allotted to the purchase of the things being sold at auction.  If there are 200 identical lots,  and 500 buyers, the price that those 200 lots fetch will be higher than if there were only 300 buyers.  This is basic, pure supply & demand.   So, given those, what happens if lots of people decide to bid on the 5 year/$1k bond?  The price they're sold for increases, right?  So instead of selling them for $800, they sell for $900.  That means that instead of them having a 25% return on investment (1000/800), it's only an 11% return on investment (1000/900).  Now, lets say the long term return drops to, say, 11%.  That's below the 5 year return of Mutual Funds for the past several years.  What does that say about the beliefs of the investors, that they're willing to take a guaranteed 11% rather than a projected 14%?  And sure, there will always be those who prefer guaranteed returns to the more risky, projected ones (those closer to retirement, for example), so some bonds will always sell for below projected mutual fund values, even if it's only one or two.  ...but when most, or all of them go for that little a return?  What does that say about the general belief of investors, when they prefer bonds to even (generally safe, but higher yield) mutual funds?"
libertarianmeme,390nzr,MuaddibMcFly,3,Mon Jun 8 18:43:47 2015 UTC,"Ok, it took me a couple of reads-throughs, but I think I get it now. If more people buy long-term bonds, then that means that people are pessimistic about the future for the stock market, and that's reflected in the bond-yield curve because the more people who buy it, the smaller the return is, right?"
libertarianmeme,390nzr,Tetrabyte,2,Thu Jun 11 14:31:08 2015 UTC,Exactly.  And I apologize that I was not clear enough that you could get it on the first read through.

libertarianmeme,390nzr,falk225,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:58:44 2015 UTC,Sure. Libertarians think government is bad. Bubbles get blown up by government intervention. Libertarians like to point out the massive failing of the government when the government ruins everyones lives. Not depending on the government often means trying to be more independent and do things yourself. Being aware of potential crisises ahead of time and preparing for them fits well with this as well.
libertarianmeme,390nzr,Regime_Change,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:49:41 2015 UTC,"Well, libertarians also believe in the market. Ask yourself this, what primarily makes up the economy, the market or the government? libertarians like to point out when the government fails - absolutely. But libertarians also like to point out when the market is successful and when the market circumvents bad government policy.   There is no guarantee that the damage done by bad government policy will outpace the natural growth of the market and that chart provides at best a poor indication of that being the case even if it would be.  Enough real economic growth enables an opportunity to increase the money supply which the government will likely use, further increasing stock market prices before they drop to a level above todays level. You simply don't know that and you can't make that judgement based on the current value. What about this chart tells you that it is the second and not the first peak that is being replicated here? There is nothing libertarian about basing ones judgement or argument on poor statistics."
libertarianmeme,390nzr,falk225,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:37:08 2015 UTC,You should decide whether you would like to talk about whether the conclusion about the bubble is wrong or whether talking about bubbles is libertarian. You are mixing the two up and it's hard to read.

He leaked sensitive documents that he didn't even know the contents of... and it turned out that the worst case in all of them was a video that was only debateably showing misconduct... but clearly was following the ROI.  Now, don't take that to mean that I agree with the solitary confinement treatment of him (her?), but then again, that is debatable as to whether there was a real suicide risk or not.   Lets all face facts here.  He was a very confused individual that (even apart from willfully damaging national security for no reason other than to damage it) would have been discharged dishonorably regardless.

The bogus tacit premise leading to the conclusion is that doctors and other skilled people are somehow magically incapable of picking shit up.  Additional deceit on the post includes the insinuation that recognizing differences in intelligence means looking down on people.  I'll disassemble the first bogus premise now.  Suppose the people who pick up shit were to disappear somehow by the Gods of Thought Experiment. In this case, the remaining doctors and engineers could very easily learn to pick shit up, and then pick at least some of the shit up.  It may be more expensive to pick shit up (because renting skilled people is more expensive), there would be some overall reduction in productivity across society, but at least in principle shit could still be picked up.  The converse is not true, though.  Should doctors and engineers disappeared somehow by the Gods of Thought Experiment, they will not be replaced by shit pickers because being a doctor or an engineer requires a brain more powerful than the brain of a shit picker. So perhaps the shit pickers will keep society as clean as before for a while, but everyone will die much younger of gruesome and preventable diseases, and the necessary machinery to keep shit picking efficient would eventually break down, taking the shit pickers back to the age where latrines and tossing shit out the window were the most advanced forms of sanitation.  The world would only recover from that democidal tragedy after many generations of children being born with the necessary brainpower to rediscover engineering and medicine.  Q.E.D.

It's not that they can't, but that they won't. Yeah, collecting trash is easy. But it's disgusting, tiresome, and confers low social status so people don't want to do it. Try to make doctors take up trash collecting jobs, I bet they won't do it even if it would pay slightly more than their current jobs. Trash collectors are paid so little not because the work they do is worthless or because ""anybody could do it"", but because people landing in those jobs don't have any other options which makes them easily exploitable. With the direction the west is headed we probably will find out soon what happens if unemployment benefit or a basic income scheme will render holding a trash collecting job absolutely meaningless. I wonder if all the doctors will start collecting trash...  I'd argue that not all work is ""equal"", but that a specific job's usefulness to society is not directly tied to how much people learn for it or how much it pays. Yeah, plastic surgery requires skill 99.99% of shitpickers don't possess but from a societal viewpoint having JK Rowling's tits perked up is not as useful as living in clean cities.   Should doctors and engineers disappeared   The argument is not that those are worthless jobs, but that people consider low-status jobs worthless based on flawed reasoning. We don't need trash collectors any less than doctors and engineers. It's just that people with choices rush to good jobs, so the bad jobs are left to people with no choice, giving birth to the notion that paying jack shit for bad jobs (which intelligent people wouldn't do if their life depended on it) is ""justified""."

Try to make doctors take up trash collecting jobs, I bet they won't do it even if it would pay slightly more than their current jobs.   If money alone was an incentive, you would be probably right.  But an economy is a dynamic system -- if trash starts overflowing trash cans, prices for collecting trash go up, and so doer the incentive for someone to pick up that work.

Considering that Switzerland has one of the most free-market economies on the planet, it’s no wonder the country has the ninth-highest per capita income in the world. Indeed, research suggests that the freer a market economy is, the faster it grows. The Swiss have the third-highest median household income in the world, which means the median Swiss household is slightly richer than the median American household. Switzerland has the fourth-lowest level of government spending as a share of the economy among the 34 OECD countries. (OECD refers to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, a group of developed countries.) The Swiss have genuine federalism and decentralized government. Their central government is responsible for around 15 percent of total government spending, which is lower than that of any other OECD country. The Swiss have a long history of armed neutrality and haven’t been involved in war since 1815. Switzerland is like a porcupine: it won’t bother you, but it would be a huge mistake to mess with it. Switzerland has the fourth-highest gun ownership rate in the world. It also has the 11th-lowest homicide rate in the world (out of 195 countries). Marijuana is decriminalized."

In a November 2009 referendum, a constitutional amendment banning the construction of new minarets was approved by 57.5% of the participating voters.  Only four of the 26 Swiss cantons,  mostly in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, opposed the initiative.  This referendum originates from action on 1 May 2007, when a group of right of centre politicians mainly from the Swiss People's Party and the Federal Democratic Union, the Egerkinger Komittee (""Egerkingen Committee"") launched a federal popular initiative that sought a constitutional ban on minarets. The minaret at the mosque of the local Turkish cultural association in Wangen bei Olten is the initial motivation for the initiative.  The Swiss government recommended that the proposed amendment be rejected as inconsistent with basic principles of the constitution.  But after the results were tabulated, the government immediately announced that the ban was in effect.

In a free market, every worker owns him/herself, and can competitively sell their labor on the market rather than being simply at the will of the collective. You own yourself, you own your labor.   In my opinion, capitalism is pro- worker. I'm not a fan of labor unions personally, but as long as the members are choosing voluntarily to be a part of the union, they should have the right to sell their labor as individuals or as a member of a collective, if they want.   I'm against governments stepping in, coercing or forcing people to only sell or buy labor in accordance with their rules, rather than choosing for themselves what they wish."

The phrase thus means “by heads” or “for each head”, i.e., per individual/person. The term is used in a wide variety of social sciences and statistical research contexts, including government statistics, economic indicators, and built environment studies.  It is commonly and usually used in the field of statistics in place of saying “for each person” or “per person”.   It is also used in wills to indicate that each of the named beneficiaries should receive, by devise or bequest, equal shares of the estate. This is in contrast to a per stirpes division, in which each branch (Latin stirps, plural stirpes) of the inheriting family inherits an equal share of the estate.

libertarianmeme,387nif,MaxBoivin,7,Tue Jun 2 15:04:31 2015 UTC,"Please don't confuse the ideas of ""fairness"" and ""Equality"" when it comes to taxation.  Both flat and head taxes are equal systems. They are applied equally to everyone. Now I think what you're getting caught up on is the fairness of the system-- with a head tax, everyone pays an equal amount of taxes and that can be considered more fair than a flat tax which everyone pays an equal percentage.  Regardless of flat or head though, the argument of fairness will always be the crucial differentiation. Both systems can be extremely regressive to the poor (which frankly is a large income group of the US) and in that case it may not be considered fair since the impact on the upper income earners is less than the low income earners.  tl;dr equality refers to the distribution of taxes, not the fairness in the amounts paid."

I won't copy the whole thing, you can go read it, but the summary is that people will sell in a black market to avoid regulation (a ban on firearms in one state leads people to purchase from a black market) and to avoid taxes.  The example of the latter is where people buy cigarettes over a tax border at cheaper prices, then sell them tax free in the tax zone.

Oh because that $100 will be worth less in a year from monetary inflation. So to borrow $100 from you, I'm going to have to pay you back ~$103 for us to be even.

They might be two sides of the same coin. When looking for whatever the cause might be, they can only see through the lens of their own values, perceptions, and experiences. Then they attack those things which don't align, because they need to blame something, either for their own fear, their own anger, their own insecurity, their own frustration, or whatever.

For most people it doesn't mean hating others, it simply means loving your own. A good example is this: the Top Gear guys are nationalist as fuck here, but they aren't hating anyone.

Those communications are not confined to the privacy of your home, so it's comparable to expecting privacy when you're outside in a public place.  That doesn't mean it's impossible to achieve privacy in those places.

If it offends you don't buy it.  If you are trying to demand that the store stop selling it you are not exercising free speech you are trying to force your beliefs on others.

libertarianmeme,378un4,littlest,4,Tue May 26 14:26:27 2015 UTC,"They are police statish. Even if you drive drunk you dont hurt anyone by default. But youre punished as if you have.  You should be held responsible for your actions, and some people can drive drunk just fine. Others can't. And those others need to know that and not do it. But if they do it and by miracle make it home in one piece, then who the fuck cares? If they do hit something though, punish them as if they had broken that thing they hit by any other means. Don't punish them as if the car is some sort of magic weapon which signals intent to destroy shit.  If you were driving drunk and hit a street light and it fell down, would you be punished the same way as if you had cut it down with an iron cutter, even though the latter is intentional and the former was not? Doubt it very much. The driving drunk aspect of it would weight HEAVILY in the sentence.  If you hit a pedestrian in your car and they broke some bones, but survived, would you be punished the same way as if you had beat that person up with a bat, even though the latter is intentional and the former was not? Doubt it very much. The driving drunk aspect of it would weight HEAVILY in the sentence. Even if you were drunk while beating them up, the two cases wouldn't even apply the same laws!!!  To hammer the point home: you can't punish someone for NOT causing harm. But that is exactly what DWI checkpoints are about. Projecting intent to harm people or property, just for being LEGALLY drunk (alcohol in any quantity is legal) performing actions that are PERFECTLY LEGAL (ie. no traffic laws have been violated), is a police state thing to do. It crosses a moral boundry that is at this point so far up our asses that even a proctologist couldn't see it.  Fuck the police.

libertarianmeme,375497,Factushima,3,Mon May 25 17:09:03 2015 UTC,"you would have to either conclude   There are more conclusions than that.   I, for instance, believe that there is a cultural divide between blacks and all other races in the US. In US black culture there is a glorification of criminality, an internalized sense of victimhood, and general mistrust and dislike of all other races (not just whites).   It is also pretty had to claim systemic racism when the rates of reported crimes are so insanely high in black communities. Racists (as though thats an identifiable group) would actually have to file false police reports to make those statistics lie.   Asians are a great comparison. While asians are underrepresented in government they beat all other races in terms of success in US society.

libertarianmeme,3766vi,PostNationalism,2,Mon May 25 05:25:06 2015 UTC,Libertarianism and anarchism are two distinct ideas.
libertarianmeme,3766vi,max225,1 point,Mon May 25 06:11:40 2015 UTC,I would say that they're not mutually exclusive. Libertarianism is an anti-authoritarian view point.

""Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism""   -- Orwell.   ""For some years past I have managed to make the capitalist class pay me several pounds a week for writing books against capitalism.""   -- Orwell  Plus, all actual libertarians are socialists since they don't support the state being used to enforce the few's ownership of practically everything.  (Such violently removes the liberty of the public.)  Instead of that, if the land (& it's natural resources) are distributed in an egalitarian fashion workers will be able to build & own the means of production.  And that (worker ownership of the means of production) is socialism.    eg, a worker's co-op where income is distributed among active workers."

libertarianmeme,36zoub,N_wah,0,Sat May 23 19:57:27 2015 UTC,"I'm saying all actual libertarians reject ""property systems"" where the few own practically everything- such violently removes the liberty of the public.    No matter what it's called (eg ""my business"") such is in reality is state territory (absentee land ownership to violently govern/control the public.)  Without such, the land would be claimed for personal use by the public & working class, leading to worker ownership of their means of production.  Basically, the state exists to remove the liberty of others, & all actual libertarians fully reject the state.  Not just services for others."
libertarianmeme,36zoub,anticapitalist,3,Sat May 23 20:00:48 2015 UTC,No. Libertarians who reject the state do not say that property rights do not exist it is that property rights exist sans the state. Without the state property rights still exist because the right to own the product of your labour and yourself is a human right.
libertarianmeme,36zoub,Sectox,3,Sat May 23 20:11:30 2015 UTC,also how can a workers income be distributed among the workers without the initiation of force? Do you own your body or does society own it?
libertarianmeme,36zoub,Sectox,0,Sat May 23 20:12:42 2015 UTC,"All you're doing is changing the topic to random things.  I didn't oppose all violence/property, but state property (absentee land ownership, aka territory, to violently govern/control the public.)  ie, the issue between socialist property (eg a co-op) and a capitalist's business is not that they are violently enforced- the difference is one is exploitative property & the other is non-exploitative property.  Obviously I also did not say ""society owns your body"" or any other random straw men you want to imagine."
libertarianmeme,36zoub,anticapitalist,0,Sat May 23 23:11:54 2015 UTC,". Libertarians who reject the state do not say that property rights do not exist    You're having reading problems.  I didn't say ""property rights do not exist.""    Actual libertarians support non-exploitative property that does not violently exploit and/or govern others.  I said state territory (absentee land ownership to violently control/government the public) is rejected by all libertarians.   because the right to own the product of your labour and yourself is a human right.   Don't pretend the land & earth was ""the product"" of anyone's labor.  What is the ""product of your work?""  To another person, such is the value of the work which they consented to.   eg if something was iron ore & you wanted to buy an iron tool, so consented to a worker producing such to sell to you. That work was the new value.  In contrast, if you live in a valley & the richest people violently claim they own it all (a state/government to honest people) & they build houses, that is not automatically value creation to the victims of that violence. They did not consent to it. They may have wanted to claim the land & build their own houses."

Chris Kyle was sent to invade a country that posed no threat to America, had no Al-Qaeda, and was not developing WMDs. After all of this information surfaced his only regret was that he didn't shoot enough Iraqis. Pretty messed up don't you think? I mean what freedoms did he perserve and fight for in Iraq?

This mentality is ridiculous.  Foreign policy is the most important aspect of libertarianism.  War is the biggest big government program.  If you are pro-war you cannot be a libertarian.  To be morally opposed to something like food stamps but be in favor of criminal wars and troops like Chris Kyle who said,""I only wish I had killed more"" is outrageous.  And the argument of ""just following orders"" is also bogus.  Its the same argument the nazi officers used in the nuremberg trials.     People like you are holding back libertarianism.  You hijack the term libertarian because you are too embarrassed to identify as conservative.  You are the reason there are 1000s of different agendas and viewpoints because of the influx of new ""libertarians"" like yourself are coming in with your pro-war garbage.

It just seems like we tend to fall for that same ""get back to the <my pet time-period> way of life"" line of thought that is pervasive among conservatives. I remember seeing a Ron Paul video (or maybe it was something he wrote) where he was talking about what time period he'd like America to emulate, and the gist of it was that while each has some good characteristics, there really is none because we've never really had true liberty for everyone, and therefore libertarianism looks to the future, not the past.

Basically, just because X is being sold at a higher price than Y, doesn't mean society thinks X is inherently more important than Y. Prices are influenced by many factors (including supply and demand), not just raw perception of ""value.""

There are 500 something billionaires in the country.  So 500 millionaire makers probably are in the thousands? There are three million teachers.  So, even if you bankrupt the billionaires, you might get what, a 1-10% raise for all of the teachers.  And then what about the cops and fireman?   Bernie's logic loses a lot of steam if you start looking at the numbers, even if you just look at the numbers.  But let's go beyond that, what if you bankrupt the billionaires, who do you give it to?  How do you make it work?  if you tax, then the federal government gets a couple billion added their revenue. They might start another naval sub program or create a new fighter jet, start a new war.  It doesn't go to teacher salaries.  Another thing to, as far as I understand, billionaires, isn't their wealth not based on income.  So, maybe they make a couple million one year, million the next.

libertarianmeme,362zx0,Anenome5,-10,Sat May 16 03:03:24 2015 UTC,I won't entertain melodramatic arguments that anything the government does is violent. Mainstream economics mostly agrees that government intervention is necessary to correct the negative externalities of pollution.

Simply looking at advertisements and not responding will not count as actively seeking job placement. Since not all unemployment may be “open” and counted by government agencies, official statistics on unemployment may not be accurate.[30] In the United States, for example, the unemployment rate does not take into consideration those individuals who are not actively looking for employment, such as those still attending college.[31] --Wikipedia   I've never paid much mind to unemployment numbers once I realized that they don't actually reflect who's working and who's not, but rather only account for who wants to work but isn't."

That's 0.17% of the mass of the moon. To put that in perspective, if you add up all the gold that has ever been mined in the world, that rounds up to about 283,495,231 kilograms.  In the event that we did remove that much, you can just multiply .17% the difference in sea level caused by the tides (.367 meters), and you'd get a difference of about .62 millimeters. So not even a millimeter in difference in sea levels. That's so insignificant it would have no effect on anything here on Earth. And we wouldn't be able to mine a 1-mile thick circumference of the moon in hundreds of thousands of years.  I'll give another example. IFL Science claims that we would save 6.59 million trees in one year if we stopped using paper cups. The crowd ate that message up.   The reality is that the total number of trees have been growing in this country for decades. We are the also the largest lumber exporter in the world.   My point is that scientific illiteracy and hatred of industrial expansion is what drives a large part of IFLS' following to protest beneficial things under the guise of environmental protection. IFL Science is also responsible for spreading misleading information."

I'm not anti-moon mining, but the methods would need to be considered as well, any pollution (or garbage left behind) etc. You don't actually dispute the claim in the picture in your criticism lol.   As far as the tree things go, the total number of trees going up doesn't matter so much, saving more trees at this point may be beneficial. You don't show that saving more trees wouldn't be beneficial...   I'm personally not huge into environment issues though. This is really only connected to politics in a roundabout way though, maybe instilling excessive environmentalism?   At any rate, the ""politics"" people get from IFLS in a round-about way is a bit different than listening to what some guy says about science which is simply incorrect, not just potentially misleading."
libertarianmeme,35z1rz,Autodidact420,2,Fri May 15 06:13:11 2015 UTC,"I dispute the idea that garbage left on the moon is of any concern to us. There is nothing living up there and garbage on the moon would have no impact on us.   The total number of trees going up demonstrates that lumbering practices of the past few decades have been completely sustainable. I do dispute the claim that 6.59 million trees would be saved, because lumber companies would have replaced that 6.59 million trees  by planting more in order to meet the demand of paper products. There is no net negative change in the amount of trees from using paper products.  Saving more of a renewable resource doesn't benefit anyone. We are literally planting enough trees for as many paper cups as we want and there is no net negative effect on the tree population for doing so. It's an irrational behavior to stop using paper products in order to try to help the environment.   I just visited IFL's facebook page and they're still posting alarmist, sensationalist nonsense about how the world is going to run out of resources soon. Their post is called ""Can Civilization Continue?""  The most liked comment I found is the comments section: ""Overthrowing capitalism is the only hope in the long run. When companies aren't allowed to make cell phones that only last 2 years in order to drum up sales, we can begin to discuss sustainable living rationally.""  This is a clear demonstration that people are so fearful of things like climate change and corporations that they want to completely throw out capitalism and make everyone live ""sustainable lives"". If this doesn't make you believe that people are being brainwashed by this sensationalist garbage, then I don't know what would.   *edit I did find a comment more liked than that, it was simply: ""End capitalism !"""

libertarianmeme,35ho34,commentsrus,1 point,Sun May 10 20:28:37 2015 UTC,"I quote here from the Communist Manifesto:  ""Of course, in the beginning, this [a communist revolution] cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, [we see here the idea that liberty is not killed in one fell swoop but is chipped away at deliberately and maliciously] and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production.  These measures will, of course, be different in different countries.  Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.  ...   A heavy progressive or graduated income tax. [It is true that the idea of a flat tax is gaining some popularity, but the mainstream is still for a progressive one. Look to Europe to see this idea extended] Abolition of all rights of inheritance. [See: death tax]   ...   Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly. [See: Federal Reserve, Ex-Im, etc.] Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State. [Public utilities anyone?]   ...   Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children’s factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, &c, &c. [Almost no one, and certainly no one in the mainstream supports ending all state schooling. Also, see emphasis on vocational training.]""   Brackets and emphasis mine.  Taken from the writings of Marx himself. These are the policies which will help undermine a free and capitalistic society and which will lead the way for a communist revolution. Anyone who advocates for these policies is either a communist agent themselves or are playing directly into the hands of the communists. There is no mistaking the point. Communist infiltration and indoctrination in our society is very real, as the near universal support these polices have attests to.  Edit: Even though when I go into edit my comment the bullets are numbered correctly, it seems reddit doesn't want to show them correctly. They should read: 2,3...5,6...10."

If so, I found the statist and it would explain you wanting to separate them from their origin as tools for a communist revolution.

Market socialism is something else entirely and encompasses alternative ways of structuring businesses in a free market economy like worker-owned cooperatives - cooperatively owned firms utilizing principles of self-management and the democratization of production, all without intervention from the state - and is a subset of a larger umbrella of left-libertarian philosophies.  I understand that the Stalinist communist state is go-to boogeyman for those on the right just as Mussolini-style Italian fascism is the go-to boogeyman for those on the left, but this dichotomy just doesn't describe reality in any meaningful way. Market socialism is no more Stalinist than free market capitalism is fascist. In fact, neither one is what the opposition claims it is. Both are market oriented philosophies of structuring businesses within a free market economy. Just because a firm wants to structure itself as a collective organization rather than a traditional capitalist organization doesn't make it evil."

The media had always attacked him as left wing or communist and I vaguely assumed along those lines dismissing him before I started watching the Trews. He has got most of the problem figured out, and he is very very good at communicating this. He is not left wing or right wing and sees those as an old system designed to contain and control the population. He recognizes that the government claims to be giving money to the poor but is actually redirecting all money and power to the rich. When it comes to solutions though is where you gain the ability to attack him. He doesn't go all the way to anarchy so people here will attack him. He still thinks the general population can take control of the government, and use it to get the stolen money back from the banks.   He thinks the government is a solution, and he defines capitalism as building a society around greed while cutting out love community and compassion. (When capitalism actually means trading without coercion) he ends up coming to the conclusion that building society around rewarding greed is the problem, and calls that problem capitalism.  Its frustrating to hear him misuse the words, but if you hear how he talks about the problems, and talks about the words, you can tell he means something else by it. That the problem isn't free trade, but how free trade is not compatible with government, especially in its current form of pyramids of money and power rich enough to buy out the government and turn it into a tool to further their power.   Whenever someone actually pushes him to explain what he thinks a better system is he reminds people that we can all agree on the problem, that we can almost all agree that almost anything is better than this. He will add that he is not smart or educated enough to design a system to replace the current one.  I think this is nice... I think we are all divided against each other quabbling over what will replace the current system always under the impression that if everyone doesn't agree on what comes next the revolution can't happen. Everyone spends their time trying to convince others of the solution, and no one focuses on realizing the problem is so bad, almost any solution empowered by the people is better.  He has narrowed down the problem to a collaboration of the rich and the government, but doesn't know where to finally point the finger. He is surprisingly awake and useful for the freedom movement, so I think attacking him for almost figuring it out but not completely just slows things down and keeps people divided over designing a future society instead of attacking the problem first."

libertarianmeme,34er52,stupidrobots,-8,Thu Apr 30 18:15:44 2015 UTC,"250 million people die.   That's complete propaganda. History is written by the victors.  And this ""history"" is written by the West & is not accurate.      The gulags.  Gulags are called killing camps on Fox News (etc.)   Reality: Over their entire  history they had about a 95% survival rate.  (But much higher during ww2.)  Which is expected  with very limited resources & so on.  And those executed include many Nazi soldiers as well as alleged murderers/etc. The Ukrainian famine is called ""killing"" in the West & is assumed to be an act of the state.  Reality: eg, the USSR sent emergency food & did other things to try to help.   ""The 1932 reductions in state procurements and exports proved hopelessly inadequate.  So did the regime's attempt to deliver food relief.  In a series of decisions in 1932-33, the Politburo reversed its policy to reserve grain relief for the cities.  In March 1932, it 'substantially reduced' the food rations... The urban death rate doubled in the main famine regions.  Between August 1932 and January 1933, the Politburo reluctantly reduced grain collection plans by 4 million tons, and the state failed to collect a planned 1 million more.  In 1932-33, it released 2-3.5 million tons of grain collections for rural consumption as food, seed, and fodder, of which 330,000 tons were for food... Most state agencies, even including the repressive apparatus, were largely overwhelmed by the scale of the famine tragedy.""      --  https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=Bc30ytJmwzMC&pg=PA502     Also:   ""Western historian Dr. Mark Tauger, who concluded that the famine was not fundamentally 'man-made'.[81][82] He says that rustic plant disease, rather than drought, was the cause of the famine.""       -- wiki     Some people count the people Stalin drafted (and killed by the Nazis) as killed by Stalin. This is not honest.       etc.  The people who deserve the blame (for troop deaths) are obviously the Nazis.       Edit: For people who missed it, the graph does have sources below the image, eg http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema06.php      The truth is it's the USA which has murdered tens of millions.:   ""Study: U.S. regime has killed 20-30 million people since World War Two""   It's actually far far more than that."

Communism is stateless and can not be ""centrally planned.""   I consider myself an anarchist, of the compassionate/voluntaryist branch.  I am well aware of the fact that central planning is the antithesis of the communism that Marx believed in when he wrote that the proletariat must be armed with weapons of war in order to prevent the Revolution from becoming a new instrument of oppression.  Somehow, every major political attempt at communism has failed to recognize that the people must be armed and trained.  Not ""your"" people, but ""the"" people.  This is the same question as the 2nd Amendment debate (and for the same reason).  If the people are armed, eventually you will achieve anarchy because that is the right, proper, and natural state of existence.  Marx understood this ... Stalin clearly didn't.   To be frank, you do not understand the words you are using.   Somewhat amusing, coming from someone who just attempted to define ""Communism"" using the word ""is."""

Somehow, every major political attempt at communism   You're confused.  In combat the initial attacker must be defeated first.  Similarly, the DotP state can not ""wither away"" until the capitalist's state is defeated first.   Somewhat amusing, coming from someone who just attempted to define ""Communism"" using the word ""is.""

RP was a libertarian trying to appeal to fiscal conservatives (hence republican) and he got shut down by the GOP. Bernie Sanders is trying to appeal to social progressives (hence democrat) but he's running against hillary so he's probably going to get shut down too. It would be disingenuous to say that either candidate is a shining example of the party they run under. Regardless of how we feel about Bernie Sanders politics, the fact that the two party system controls who gets a voice and who goes on the ballot is shit.

So, you decide to arm yourself just in case. And should you find yourself in a situation where protecting yourself from harm is the only choice, you may run out of bullets (and the rest of the mob gets you) or they shoot back. All because you wanted to go to the corner store (which may have been looted anyways) to buy a Big Gulp. So, are you kept at home by a terrorist group or the government? Which answer makes it ok?"

When they thought that there weren't enough of their people in management positions the US passed Affirmative Action to change that yet they still complain about it. When the unemployment of blacks rose in the middle of the last century the welfare amount was raised so they could live off of it yet they complain that it's not enough. When the situation happened in Baltimore the officers in question were arrested and are going to face trial yet there is still rioting. Blacks are being heard and have caused major changes in American society but if they choose to believe that then the majority of them can't play the victim and act like the only oppressed people anymore.

When he did see police, “they weren’t making arrests”—not even the cops in two squad cars that pulled up when Townsend’s buddies were robbing a pawn shop. He says the cops shooed them away, got back in their cars, and drove off.  The gangs were on their own, and they seized the opportunity. “Pretty much we started thinking in terms of what is of value,” Townsend recalled. “Where are the jewelry stores, the television store, the furniture store.” When they saw an automotive store, they “went in and started stealing tires. None of us needed tires, but let’s fill the backyard up with tires. Now we have tires.”   Fuck you, MLK."

And I have no doubt the tactics are getting a lot of people killed.  But there is also no doubt that the U.S. backs the current Ukrainian regime with our tax dollars and that the same forces helped fund and push the overthrow of the corrupt, pro-Russian president.  And, are you not aware of the U.S. forces currently sent to train the Ukrainians?  If you want to fight and die for the mess that the Soviets made and join the Ukrainian rebel alliance or whatever, that's your call.  People in the U.S. don't have an immediate security interest here.  Putin's Russia has nukes and starting a proxy war on his doorstep is quite insane.    Russia, the Ukraine and most of Asia is a stinking cesspool of government corruption and has been for centuries.  Pushing for war there isn't going to help matters, it's just going to make it worse.

The law amends the federal criminal code to make it a crime for a person to fraudulently claim having received any of a series of particular military decorations with the intention of obtaining money, property, or other tangible benefit from convincing someone that he or she rightfully did receive that award. This law is a revised version of a previous one that was struck down by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case United States v.

I'm pretty inclined to the left, but whatever libertarianism works for me too. Seems different types of ideologies (say, progressive lib) value a different version of freedom and equality than you guys do. They value equality of opportunity and 'meaningful freedom' for the poorer people, while you more so value freedom of individuals which may come at the expense of the 'meaningful freedom' of the poorer masses."
libertarianmeme,33kz1z,Autodidact420,1 point,Sun Apr 26 07:58:56 2015 UTC,"I think you are correct in that equality means something different to Liberals than it does everyone else. Liberals think equality means making sure everyone ends up with the same outcome. To say they value equality of opportunity or meaningful freedom is laughable.  Bluntly: Liberals want poor people to have the freedom to choose which color of iphone they get (paid for by confiscating money from rich people).  This is not ""meaningful freedom""... meaningful freedom is when people are free to make their own decisions in life and in turn suffer the consequences or reap the rewards from those decisions. That is literally the opposite of what Liberals want.  That is also not ""equality of opportunity"".... What they want is equality of outcome. ""You didnt make the decisions in life that would allow you to afford an iPhone? No worries, we Liberals will take from someone else and provide an iPhone for you... see, now everyone has iPhones so everyone is equal... be happy""  As for your first sentence, NO it isnt disingenuous once you accept that when people have true freedom the outcomes of their lives will be very different especially when they are all treated equally by the state. Yes, that literally means that some kids are so poor they starve and others never have to work in their lives. That is as ""meaningful freedom"" as there an be. One kids parents might have worked their asses off, sacrificed, and saved to set her up for success. They should be free to do so. I understand the natural inclination to resent people who were ""Born on third base""... but the fact is they were born there because their parents (or grandparents or whatever) had the freedom to better prepare their progeny for the world. As they should. Some peoples parents are more interested in practicing shitty cultures or trivial material things than they are in ensuring their children's success. Again, the consequences for those inclinations should be seen in a free society.    Harsh? Well here is the good news, people like you and I who hate to think of kids starving have literally NOTHING stopping us from helping them in a free society. We could gather all of our like-minded people and pool our funds an feed every kid in America if we wanted. And you could take it even further than food. Whatever you think these poor kids are lacking in, you are free to gather the appropriate resources to provide it to them."
libertarianmeme,33kz1z,UnmakerOmega,1 point,Sun Apr 26 12:38:15 2015 UTC,"Ah hell I had typed out a long response and then clicked back lol.   Most ideologies have a different idea of what freedom means and requires.   Taxation is sometimes justifiable morally in several of the popular ethical theories. Only siths deal in absolutes :3  If I'm born into starvation, I don't have meaningful freedom. My parents freedom has significantly hampered my freedom to the point of my entire existence being pretty much pre-determined.  Views on how wealth etc. works also effect this. Liberals would generally say that no, an individual did not work hard enough to get an iphone, society allows this whole process to happen, society created the wealth. Society doesn't want to be creating wealth that it sees no benefits from. If you feel you could, try doing so on a desert island or something and see how far that gets you.Others might argue that the very land and especially natural resources are not really the property of individuals and we allow them to be traded as so as a society, and expect a benefit from it not ""you get to be born into starvation and die at 7. Now thank us for your freedom to die at a young age, and never get an education!""    People don't resent those born on third base as much as they resent people born with a blown knee.    And again, others simply disagree on what meaningful freedom is.  People like you and I did decide to do something, we said ""hey, if you want to use our societial resources, you have to pitch in and not let kids die of starvation!""   We're still free to appropriate resources."

The purpose of property is to delineate who can legitimately use a scarce resource that can only be used by one person at a time.  If I own a car, the restriction on other people is that they cannot use my car, because their use of the car prevents me, the legitimate owner, from using the car.  If I claim to own an idea, how can others be restricted from using that idea? Their use of the idea does not prevent me from also using it. So since I retain use of the idea at all times, no matter who else uses it, it does not make sense to call it my property and restrict the use of it to others."

Yes they use patents this way but this isn't the design of the patent. The purpose of the patent is to give you as an individual a chance to profit off of your contributions that would otherwise be taken by the monopolies who would offer you no compensation.  If you invent something that improves on an existing product like the automobile and all manufactures start using your idea shouldn't you be compensated for your idea?

Ireland was never once, in recorded history, without some sort of government.  Even back to the Book of Invasions, you had Kings ruling over people.  Balor over the Fomorians, Nuada and Lugh over the Tuatha De Dannan, and any number of individuals over the Milesians, from Eremon and Eber Finn through Brian Boru and on.  Cu chullain, one of Ireland's greatest heroes, fought singlehandedly against the aggression of Queen Medb.

That is to say that a society needs some means of law production, it needs some means of dispute resolution (courts), and it needs some means of regional defense (police / military).

You're wrong again. See the first paragraphs of the essay ""Anatomy of the State"" for a good definition of the state.  One can choose to be bound by a specific law by contract with another, and we do not call this contract.  A society sans government would be a society of contract.   If you can opt out of laws, then one of the most important things that society needs to function isn't there.   Rather than opting out, you will have to opt in. Once you opt in, you have an obligation until you opt out. If you violate the conduct agreement before you opt out, you can reasonably be prosecuted under that agreement, since it was in effect when you broke the conduct agreement, and you gave prior consent to how such things would be dealt with.

Long after I parted company with the Republican platform I was voting Republican and setting myself up for disappointment. And those days are completely done.  The final step was switching my registration -originally I kept it R because that's the only way I could vote in the primary in my state.

I really thought Obama was going to be a single term pres. for example.   Here's some of what changed my mind. My state is sometimes red and sometimes blue.  We have a weird mix of hippies, libertarians, bohemians, conservatives, and socialists. I spent a few years volunteering for the county and state Republicans.  In that time, I saw several different factions fighting so much with each other that they spent most of their time fighting for control of the party and very little time fighting for control of the state (until very recently our legislature had been Dem for the past 70 years which explains why the state is in the shitter in so many ways).  And I'd almost be understanding toward the different R factions about all this in-fighting if it had to do with platform... But it didn't. In fact, in all of these battles platform wasn't an issue, personality was.  The R factions were groups of people supporting particular favorite personalities who each promised to ""get rid of the Dems"".  Heard very little about actual beliefs. And year after year they lose. Because at least from what I've seen they've become more the party of trying to get elected than the party of actually trying to accomplish platform goals.  So, I guess I've started to hit the cynical age. I need to see something better happen before I start believing in the R's again.  Because I gave them all the support of my youth and it's been nothing but a let down."

These guys are disinformation goon squad:   In the 1990s, the Heartland Institute worked with tobacco company Philip Morris to question the links between smoking, secondhand smoke and health risks. Philip Morris commissioned Heartland to write and distribute reports. Heartland published a ""policy study"" which summarized a jointly prepared report by the Association of Private Enterprise Education and Philip Morris. The Heartland Institute also undertook a variety of other activities on behalf of the tobacco industry, including meeting with legislators, holding ""off-the-record"" briefings, and producing op-eds, radio interviews, and letters.[71] A 1993 internal ""Five Year Plan"" from Philip Morris to address environmental tobacco smoke regulation called for support for the efforts of the Heartland Institute.[72][73] In a 1996 essay entitled ""Joe Camel is Innocent!,"" Heartland president and chief executive officer Joe Blast wrote that contributions from the tobacco industry to Republican political campaigns were most likely because Republicans ""have been leading the fight against the use of 'junk science' by the Food and Drug Administration and its evil twin, the Environmental Protection Agency.""[74] In the ""President's Letter"" in the July, 1998 issue of The Heartlander, the Heartland Institute's magazine, Blast wrote, ""smoking in moderation has few, if any, adverse health effects.""[75][76] In 1999 Blast referenced the essays in soliciting financial support from Philip Morris, writing ""Heartland does many things that benefit Philip Morris' bottom line, things that no other organization does.""[72] A Philip Morris executive, the firm's manager of industrial affairs, was a member of the board of directors of the Heartland Institute.[72]"

Corporate welfare is just as bad (Some including myself would argue worse) than the individual welfare received. I think you can make a morale case (though I will still disagree with it) for taxing the working poor and middle class to help a 23 year old unemployed mother but there is absolutely no way you can argue taxing those same individuals to help millionaires or billionaires.
libertarianmeme,31zyo2,MuuaadDib,1 point,Fri Apr 10 06:35:37 2015 UTC,Tax breaks are not corporate subsidies. Tax breaks are keeping money you already earned.
libertarianmeme,31zyo2,MuuaadDib,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:52:57 2015 UTC,"What is NOT considered corporate welfare? Government Contracts - To clarify what is and isn’t corporate welfare, a “no-bid” Iraq contract for the prestigious Halliburton, would not be considered corporate welfare because the government technically directly receives some good or service in exchange for this expenditure. Based on the Pentagon’s Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) findings of $1.4 billion of overcharging and fraud, I suppose the primary service they provide could be considered to be repeatedly violating the American taxpayer. Tax Breaks – Tax breaks targeted to benefit specific corporations could also be considered a form of welfare. Tax loopholes force other businesses and individual taxpayers without the same political clout to pick up the slack and sacrifice a greater share of their hard-earned money to decrease the financial burden on these corporations. However, to simplify matters, we’ve only included financial handouts to companies in our working definition of corporate welfare.  What IS considered corporate welfare? Subsidies – On the other hand, the $15 billion in subsidies contained in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, to the oil, gas, and coal industries, would be considered corporate welfare because no goods or services are directly returned to the government in exchange for these expenditures."
libertarianmeme,31zyo2,tigerdrummer,-1,Thu Apr 9 21:04:08 2015 UTC,"So since actual corporate welfare is $15billion, and individual welfare is $2.56trillion, the outrage over corporate welfare should make up 0.58% over the total amount of welfare rage.

You are not allowed to own anything you make/have in a commune. If you agree with that in a voluntary way, more power to you. The real question is in ownership. Do you technically own your body in a commune? If not, do you have to share your body in a sexual manor with everyone? Ancoms assume that everyone's work is equal in value, so you are either limited to the slowest worker or your extra hard work goes unappreciated. Say, one day, you get tired of working your ass off and living on equal grounds and you tell your commune that you want to leave. If they truly see your value (which technically doesn't exist in an ancom world), they will try real hard to keep you in and working.   How would you go about voting in a commune? Say even all but one person agrees to a change in the commune, what happens with that one person? You either live with an all or nothing philosophy, and if that is the case, that one person has control, or you go with a majority rule, and that one person is being controlled/forced into behavior from the many."

I don't think this is the case. The Indiana law was a response to the New Mexico ruling that went the other way, in response to the Federal law.  Here's how it went down: A man was denied unemployment because he was fired for smoking peyote. He argued to the Supreme Court that his practice was protected because it was religious in nature. The Supreme Court disagreed. Congress then passed the Federal Law to supersede the court ruling and give the courts more guidance on how to rule on these cases. None of this had anything to do with individuals discriminating on religious grounds (only the government). Then, the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled that individuals (and businesses) must abide by the same non-discrimination rules that the government must. The Indiana law was a reaffirmation that private individuals (and businesses) have the right to choose according to their conscience and are not beholden to the restrictions that are on the government. The law provides guidance to Indiana courts to this effect. That's all. It's not about ""chipping away at separation of church and state,"" as you fear."

It doesn't explain why they waited until gay marriage was winning cases all over. It doesn't explain what there was even need for it when discrimination is already going to negatively impact your business regardless of whether federal, state or local laws prohibit it. It also doesn't explain why the governor signed it in private with a bunch of people dressed like pilgrims, and just so happens to have a fair number of anti-gay activists in it. Regardless of the personal convictions involved, the intent was to use the law to allow someone's rights to trump someone else's by using religious convictions that are just short of arbitrary. Giving religion protection under the law to circumvent any discrimination laws that exist or could be passed. It's not a big chip, but over time these things can add up."

libertarianmeme,314qvc,TiredUnicorn,4,Thu Apr 2 04:23:29 2015 UTC,"This has always been exactly my point.  Everyone should be entitled to deny service to whomever they want.  If someone is prejudiced against you, why the fuck would you want to give them your money anyway?  An obvious exception would have to be doctors, just because in an emergency you might have no options, but promising to do your best for every patient merely needs to be part of the agreement all doctors make when they apply to work at any clinic or hospital.  People always invoke the pre-civil rights South as the reason why we can't let people discriminate, but what they fail to understand is that the problem in the South wasn't that discrimination was legal.  It was legal in the North.  The problem with the South was that it was mandatory.  That's what Jim Crow laws were all about.  And should anyone question this regime or dare to be vocal against it, there was a terrorist organization that would harass and potentially kill you and your family.  Discrimination would have been, as was once the liberal cry toward the legalization of abortion, ""safe, legal, and rare"", absent laws which did not make discrimination an option, but rather, a legal obligation.  If the market is actually free, most businesses will accept all customers.  Those few that want to discriminate on a racist or other ideological agenda will pay a price in the marketplace by losing that business, and potentially being subject to boycotts and other actions against them."

I have mixed feelings on this issue and I have not been convinced one way or another. I see this not as a gay rights issue but a human rights issue. Much in the same way that if a town refused to serve the one Muslim family, or refused to serve the black family. Sure they could go to another store, but should one's position in life, under no control of theirs dictate the amount of ""equality"" they experience. I agree that if a prejudice bakery owner is going to be  prejudice, that's their shitty right. However, is it really that big of an issue to make a cake? The only part that's going to be gay is probably just the topper. Imagine how far religious freedom can be expanded, your car breaks down and the one tow company refuses to serve you because of your race/religion/sexuality. You try calling other tow companies but they won't go out that far. It's not the business won't serve your location, they just won't serve you.  The owner totally has the right to be exclusive, kick people out,  etc. But another redditor made a good point on a similar post a while ago. If they want to be exclusive, they can make their business a club and discriminate as much as they want. When they're a business, they're open to the PUBLIC, no asterisk attached."

But if an individual has no other choice, I don't get how that business practice can be beneficial to a free market. If there was competition, sure! Boycott one store and do business with the other.   In a thought scenario, you have a private utility run to your house,  water, gas, electricity. They find out through some means that you are a religion, sexuality, race that the company's religion disagrees with. They shut off access to your services. Now you can either A) do nothing and hope the winter isn't too cold. B) Hope that another utility can serve you and you have enough money to pay for the hookups. C) move.   None of these are ideal and honestly I have no idea why a product or a service cannot be sold to someone based on your religion or the fact that your a business owner.

libertarianmeme,314qvc,seattleandrew,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:21:54 2015 UTC,"I don't get how that business practice can be beneficial to a free market.    You, with this sentence, argued that governmental regulation of the market is supportive of the free market.  And if you believe that, fine... but /r/libertarianmeme ins't the place for this discussion.    I have no idea why a product or a service cannot be sold to someone based on your religion or the fact that your a business owner. Kick someone out of your store for swearing, being a jackass, being disruptive. Don't kick them out for some petty reason like my religion said so.   Just to indulge, here is why.   Photography has been declared by the supreme court to be speech. The act of creating something that sends a message is speech.    “In deciding whether particular conduct possesses sufficient communicative elements to bring the First Amendment into play, we have asked whether [a]n intent to convey a particularized message was present, and [whether] the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.” Texas v. Johnson (1989)   Clearly creating a photograph is true on both accounts.   Six years later, the Supreme Court reiterated, “To achieve First Amendment protection, a plaintiff must show that he possessed: (1) a message to be communicated; and (2) an audience to receive that message, regardless of the medium in which the message is to be expressed.” Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Group (1995)   Again, clearly photographs count... especially those by a photographer of an event, such as a wedding.  The intent is to convey a message of love and such, and the audience is family and friends and public that has an interest in the wedding.  So the the New Mexico case  is where the state supreme court upheld that a photographer can't refuse a gay wedding, and the US supreme court rejected the case... meaning that the current law is that photographers can't deny gay contracts.  The problem with that is that it compels free speech.  It forces the photographer to create photographs (legally speech) that send a message that he dosen't believe in.  Its like (actually, it literally is) the state saying that unless you believe in and support gay marriage, and are willing to publicly state that, you can't own a business in the US.  Which is beyond religious freedoms by a mile.  And that is the problem with the bakeries as well.  Now, i get it, wedding cake design isn't legally protected as free speech, but it rationally is very close to it. (especially when you literally are piping the words onto a cake).  Again, neither (Oregon, Colorado) of these bakeries refused to sell anything they had in their stores to gay people.  They just refused (politely) to create something that sent a message that they didn't believe.   Which isn't unreasonable, and has very little to do with freedom of religion.   Look at it this way. The only reason that this was declared illegal (and technically it is illegal, due to anti-discrimination laws) was because it was ""against"" a protected class (gays).  If they refused a wedding because they hated fat people, it would be completely legal.   And this brings up the crux of the issue, that anti-discrimination laws inherently violate basic freedoms and rights in this country.    And again, this isn't even bringing in freedom of religion at all.   So i get it... you are worried about discrimination.  Fine. But there is already tons of legal discrimination in this country, just based on things other than age, sex, race or sexual orientation.   Income, for example.  Social class.  Attractiveness.  These things are running rampant today, and we see discriminatory practices daily.  Do you not want to fix them?  I assume you do... so you are left with more laws and regulations ""stopping"" them.  Which, whatever.  But it does make you a (liberal) statist.  Which... again, fine. Loads of people are.  But why are you in this subreddit?"

I'm not saying the free market wouldn't change it, I'm just pointing out that when you are a minority to such an extreme that LBGT are, it might take awhile for a change to happen, as the amount of missed capital from the minority would be negligible. Possibly even with pro-LBGT help as well.   Then if you are a baker who will serve LBGT, if the majority decides to boycott you, you very easily could be forced out of business.

libertarianmeme,314qvc,bubosa,-2,Wed Apr 8 09:01:54 2015 UTC,"I can explain how SOME acts of discrimination violate the NAP. And if you are a minarchist like me, perhaps you might agree that these instances of discrimination should be outlawed.  Let's say I open a store that sells a product that you want. So you take time out of your day and burn gas in your car to come to my store. Only then do you find a sign on my store that says that people of your demographic aren't allowed inside. So I have committed a minor act of fraud by causing you to waste your time, energy, and resources to visit my store for reasons that don't even really benefit me. So if I advertise my store or product to the public, then I must allow all members of the public inside my store.  What if a business publicly advertises that they are a ""white-only"" establishment? I really don't think that business owner is someone who expects to pay his creditors, vendors, employees, and make a profit on top of that. I think such a person is trying to stir the pot. The reality is that banks that make business loans have a reasonable expectation that the business owner will serve all potential customers in an effort to repay the loan. I can't imagine a bank that would knowingly make a loan to a borrower who intended to start a business that was going to fail on purpose.  Most businesses support anti-discrimination laws because they want as many customers as possible. Since Jim Crow laws are within living memory, a substantial portion of the population needs that extra reassurance that they will be served in any public establishment. From time to time, people will libel and slander a business by claiming that it practices discrimination. Anti-discrimination laws help guard against that slander.  Libertarians should not spend what little time, resources, and political capital that we have defending the rights of bigots to run a business into the ground. While it can make for an interesting abstract philosophical discussion, there are much more important battles for activists to fight.  There are some businesses that openly discriminate and have a good reason to do so: Dating websites! Blackpeoplemeet.com, Cristianmingle, and J-Date make it pretty clear who they want as costumers.

By doing so, they have a very good position to hold on. the government officials there gets money from Israel, and they also get free electricity and water for the citizens, so they want to be in a constant war with Israel. why? because they get all those freebies because of this war state, that enforce Israel to put them under siege, and therefore provide them ""humanitarian"" conditions.  This is really messed up.

libertarianmeme,30qfxd,aletoledo,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:24:50 2015 UTC,"I suppose the problem I have is that I want some control over the rules and todays system gives me no control.    Right, so your problem is with the fact that our democracy is out of the ands of citizens, which is the purpose of democracy.  THAT is a normal statement.  I have that same issue.  I have major reservations with our electoral system, outdated laws, deteriorating personal freedoms, international interventions, and military industrial complex kickbacks.  I even support actions beyond voting to fix problems in government.  But then taking this problem all the way to ""well laws are all arbitrary and we're better off with no laws and no government"" is bat-shit crazy anarchist fantasy.  And I thought Libertarians understood that DEMOCRACY is a good thing. That in a representative society, the citizens can demand what level of personal freedom and group freedom we have, because that's what it comes down to.  How do you guys all think we ended up with democracy in the first place? People had already been making decisions with each other, SOCIAL CONTRACTS person to person, and they made it bigger. Individuals made agreements with each other, ones that I hope you all would agree to as well, such as don't steal, or kill, or murder, or rape, and a whole slew of very practical common sense RULES OF LIFE. Eventually we have enough rules of life we write them down.  When people don't agree on the rules? We ask the majority of people what THEY think the rules of life are.  In fancy speak, we call them laws.  Do I think laws are the only thing keeping people from killing each other? No, that's crazy, and that'd be terrifying if getting caught was the reason most people don't kill and steal (or a fear of hell...)  I have more faith, and think that a small scale libertarian hippy camp could work.... for a while..    But democracy and majority rules laws are a NATURAL PROGRESSION of society, and even a libertarian hippy camp with total personal freedom and no laws would eventually all sit down one day when a big issue rose up, discuss the problem, and reach a majority consensus on how to move forward.  Perhaps they would even write it on a piece of paper to avoid any confusion in the future.   Or... do you think your libertarian love fest will do just fine with out ever having to decide a single thing as a group?"
libertarianmeme,30qfxd,okalyddude,1 point,Tue Mar 31 11:10:49 2015 UTC,"And I thought Libertarians understood that DEMOCRACY is a good thing.    Sure, but the free market is the epitome of democracy.

I hope you all would agree to as well, such as don't steal, or kill, or murder, or rape, and a whole slew of very practical common sense RULES OF LIFE.   except we have these same rules without government. Eliminating government doesn't mean that people start butt raping everyone they see. Eliminating government means that we take back responsibility for our own lives. No more bailouts, no more wars, no more debt, now more prison-industrial complex, etc...   NATURAL PROGRESSION of society   If todays world is a progression from bad to good, then stop the ride and let me off. I don't want any more good, it's ""good"" enough already and I can't stand to bear any more ""good"".   do you think your libertarian love fest will do just fine with out ever having to decide a single thing as a group?   There is a difference between government and governance. Government is just one form of governance. Societies and communities can be formed outside of a man at the top pointing a gun at the rest of us.  The thing about anarchy and liberty is that I don't ask you to join me, I just ask that you allow me to leave."

It also doesn't mean the actual service isn't good, and everyone I know who has actually needed the medical care has got it rather timely. That said, a mixed system like the UK appears to be better. It's also worth noting that the USA's model is almost always ranked the shittiest (or was before Obamacare, idk now) out of comparable countries. Sure,  the USA had the best care for rich people, it also had shitty care for poor people.   Ironically, Canada's healthcare is often placed just above the USA even though it's something we're always proud of. Other countries with more heavily funded healthcare do better, but the best appear to be a mixed system with public healthcare in competition with private healthcare."

Bottom line, when demand exceeds supply (or really anytime there are limited resources) you have two options for distribution  1) Sell the resources and use price to determine distribution 2) Let a bureaucrat decide  You can argue that your doctor decides but he/she doesn't, they're still subject to medical policies decided by a bureaucrat.   So as long as hospitals aren't forced to see and treat patients at certain prices you some form of #1 save for ER treatment, which is why everyone who pays for ER treatment gets screwed and frankly everyone who goes to a hospital for anything."

He committed atrocities, but people are blinding themselves with emotion and the connotation of his crimes against humanity if they call him a bad leader.   He convinced one of the most developed and intelligent nations in the world to follow him into a great war fueled on a rhetoric approaching insanity in some respects, and was responsible for the blood of millions.   ""Great"" doesn't mean ""morally good"", it means ""spectacular at something"", which Hitler was very much so when it came to leading Germany. His economic, military, and political might struck fear the world-over, and let's remember that it took the greatest powers the world had, working together, to bring him and his ""aryan empire"" crashing down. He wasn't a terrible leader, he was a great leader that orchestrated terrible things. A bad leader brings will get kicked out of their country. A great leader can convince his well-educated country to believe in eugenics and follow them to war against half of Europe."

libertarianmeme,30a5ow,Autodidact420,2,Thu Mar 26 15:15:34 2015 UTC,"No ""absolute shithole"" does as well as Nazi Germany did in a slugfest against Britain, the US, and the Soviets. If the US had been kept out of the war, Germany may have finished full taking of Europe (yes, that Europe), which is not something ""shitholes"" are capable of. The Allies already had a drawn-up plan for a failed D-Day Invasion, not something we generally do for nations that we don't view as a formidable opponent.  They may have had inflation and poverty, but their war-related industries, universities, and military were arguably the best in the world before the US scrambled to mobilize, and after war there would have been plenty of room and resources for Hitler's Aryan Empire to switch gears from a war to a peacetime economy. They undeniably had huge economic problems and unsustainable ways of dealing with them in the 1930's and through the War, but so did every other major player in the 1930's (Hooverville, anybody?)  We can't simultaneously say it's a great feat to beat them as well as say they're shitheads. They weren't, and there's a reason the US and Soviets fought so hard for German scientists with practical war applications under programs like Operation: Paperclip. 1920 Germany and 1940 Germany are as many worlds apart as 1920 US was from 1940 US."

That leader then delegates to those who are stronger in those areas.  Hitler was a terrible military cammander and made many tactical mistakes during the war. His generals often disagreed with his decisions, but he rarely accepted input from those under him. He committed a massive amount of troops to fight in Russia, and then refused to withdraw, reinforce or surrender those troops when it was obvious they could not win. The entire German 6th army of 100,000 troops was destroyed with only 6,000 every returning home after the war.  He started a war on both the eastern and western front, committing troops to two operations. This is one of the things that ultimately doomed Germany in WWII. He also spent too much time and effort in developing wonder weapons and often deciding himself how they would be implemented instead of letting the experts who developed them decide.  Hitler rode the wave of antisemitism that was prevalent in Germany at the time. It wasn't something he came up with. He promised jobs to a country with a bankrupt economy and also appealed to a country that felt cheated by the Treaty of Versailles.   His greatest achievement was as an orator, to call him a great leader is laughable. He rode popular sentiment and when he was in a position to lead drove the country to war. He then made so many inept decisions that he put the country right back where it was after WWI."

The public school this was printed at clearly should of proof read this article for factual errors. Letting shit like this get published in their paper can be viewed as an endorsement of this historical fiction. Or at the very least an endorsement that ignorance and misinformation are perfectly exceptionable.   I'm sure you could find someone in a private school who gets facts wrong. I'm just not sure what that has to do with this discussion.

The lawsuit was nothing whatsoever with how the RR canola got there, it was the fact that he had deliberately used a patented product to a vast extent without paying the required license, and had purposely acted to avoid paying the required license.  Anyone's views on patent laws are not the point here. The point is that he purposefully and willingly acted against the law.

I'll say again: the contamination part was not part of the lawsuit whatsoever and I wouldn't have made a joy of difference if he had proved it.   Because his fields had 95-98% pure RR canola, over 1,016 acres, and it was deemed impossible for that level of purity to have happened in 2 generations without him purposely collecting it and spreading it, and we know he did because his farmhands testified that he told them to do exactly that. Even if he did find it randomly on his land, that doesn't mean he can spread it across his land.   As an analogy, just because you find a copy of Frozen on your driveway doesn't mean you can make thousands of copies and try to sell them at the market because you found it. The laws surrounding reproducing intellectual property don't vanish just because you find something on the ground.   Whatever your view on IP laws, he knowingly infringed the law.   So no, he wasn't sued because of cross contamination, nor was cross contamination any relevant part of the case."

They include:     Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), or simply dioxins. PCDDs are derivatives of dibenzo-p-dioxin. There are 75 PCDDs, and seven of them are specifically toxic. Polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), or furans. PCDFs are derivatives of dibenzofuran. There are 135 congeners (derivatives differing only in the number and location of chlorine atoms). Whilst they strictly speaking are not dioxins, ten of them have ""dioxin-like"" properties. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which also are not dioxins, but twelve of them have ""dioxin-like"" properties. Under certain conditions PCBs may form dibenzofurans through partial oxidation. Finally, dioxin may refer to dioxin proper, the basic chemical unit of the more complex dioxins. This simple compound is not persistent and has no PCDD-like toxicity.   Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins  Polychlorinated dibenzofurans  Polychlorinated biphenyls  1,4-dioxin  Because dioxins refer to such a broad class of compounds that vary widely in toxicity, the concept of toxic equivalence (TEQ) has been developed to facilitate risk assessment and regulatory control. Toxic equivalence factors (TEFs) exist for seven congeners of dioxins, ten furans and twelve PCBs. The reference congener is the most toxic dioxin 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) which per definition has a TEF of one.   In reference to their importance as environmental toxicants the term dioxins is used almost exclusively to refer to the sum of compounds (as TEQ) from the above groups which demonstrate the same specific toxic mode of action associated with TCDD. These include 17 PCDD/Fs and 12 PCBs. Incidents of contamination with PCBs are also often reported as dioxin contamination incidents since it is this toxic characteristic which is of most public and regulatory concern.

Regarding your second point, please don't take this as directed at you, but that topic really pisses me off... Many GMO advocates will say that GM extends to hybrid techniques that have been used for hundreds or thousands of years in order to conflate modern techniques with natural techniques. I find that position disingenuous at best. Neil de Grasse Tyson has advocated that position, and it seem pretty much completely fucking insane to suggest that someone could drill a hole in an apple tree and stick a jellyfish in it to come up with fluorescent apples (or just pick anything you like there).   I'm perfectly content to sit back and NOT take advantage of any purported GM advantages until they have a half century or more of proven safety and nutrition.   Simply put, there is too much money involved in the industry to put any faith in the ""science"" for the moment. I do not have the time to thoroughly investigate everything, and I remain skeptical when money pollutes ""science"". Patents help ensure that the ""science"" is polluted, and often purely toxic.

Why is 50 the golden number? We've been testing it for decades with literally zero evidence of harm. Modern organic farming has nowhere near the level of study yet that is accepted as fine without question? Same with modern hybrid seeds? Why are GM seeds the only one that gets this disproportionate demand for testing?  And the reason people like NGT compare GMO seeds with other versions of seeds is because it makes no sense to be scared of genetic engineering when we've been crudely messing with genes for centuries. The foods we eat today, whether organic, GMO, conventional, mutagenic etc are nothing like their predecessors. When you hybridise seed, you are randomly mixing the genetic structure hoping to get a particular outcome. This involves hundreds of base pairs being mixed at random and is fine. A single targeted gene gets changed and tested and we run for the hills?   Don't kid yourself that ""organic"" is natural or represents what humans have eaten for millennia. It couldn't be any farther from the truth."

If we both were to agree that an unborn baby has a right to life I have no clue why you would bring up bodyguards and things like that. The unborn baby has the same right to life as you or I. The state protects our right to life by making it illegal for someone else to kill us without just cause. Why should it be any different for an unborn baby?  No one suggested state-funded personal body guards except for you.   And the president does not have a right to 24 hour state sponsored protection. That is an entitlement that comes along with the office. If legislation were passed to remove that protection the president could not object on the grounds of his right to life being infringed.   Just curious, are you from the US? Asking because your concept of rights seem to be different than ours.   To us when you have the right to something it means that thing can not be taken away, it does not mean that thing must be bestowed upon you.  Right to life = you cant kill me.  Right to bear arms = you cant take my weapons away from me  What you described as a ""positive right"" isn't a right at all, that is an entitlement. At least in the traditional American view. Liberal/Statist/Fascists are doing their best to change that. They refer to all manner of entitlements as rights. ""Health care is a RIGHT"", etc."

Generally prices falling are a good thing, but deflation increases the real value of debt which is not a good thing. Also, under the gold standard we had things like bank runs. I get the appeal of having your currency backed by something, but the gold standard would most likely not work very well in a modern economy."

I understand and agree with the defense of personal independence and rights and freedoms.  I don't understand the virulently anti-statist positions of the more recent libertarians.  As far as I know, there are no successful examples of a libertarian state, anywhere.   There might be a few sort-of-examples, but they invariably exist inside the military hegemony of another larger state, use a larger country's currency, etc.   They're basically parasite states, like the banking haven in the Cayman islands, set up for people to avoid taxes.  So it all seems like a fairy tail to me, and not a very productive one since it takes all the libertarians' energies out of our real political system and thus leads to the continuation of the status quo.  What that cartoon illustrates is the current situation - the interests of the very wealthy in America are diametrically opposite to those of the vast majority of people - the upper-middle, middle and lower classes.  Libertarians seem to ignore this issue - so my sense is that they're ignoring their real interests in favor of this fantasy of 'regulation-free islands' or fictitious Galt's Gulch utopias.  They don't work.  They always collapse into dystopias.     Please show me that I'm wrong.  I throw down the gauntlet."

The Libertarian Party gets a lot of legal challenges levied against them by the Big Two.  Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio are all places where the GOP actively has tried to keep us away from the primaries.  So, I promise; we're as angry at them as you are, and they probably hate us more than Democrats do.    That type of suppression happens across the board, and it's always done ""in the name of your own good.""  Every one of those corrupt politicians who try to keep us off the ballot will look you in the eye and say, ""you're letting the Democrats win.""  Which is bullshit.    We're a lot more evenly split on the Big Two than you might think; I used to be a Democrat until about four years ago, and I know there are an awful lot of former progressive libertarians.  Not all of us come from conservative backgrounds.    I think most other libertarians would agree with me that Wyden (D, OR) and Amash (R, MI) are two of the best people in Congress right now.  The rest of them can take a hike.  Rand Paul's a good conservative, but he's not a good libertarian."

That's a big deal - a more important deal (to me) than the libertarian priorities, and possibly in conflict with them since the Libertarians and the GOP make common cause in never accepting any new taxes for anything,ever, no matter what the situation.    We had two wars going on over the last decade at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars, along with very large cuts in taxes in 2001-2004, along with a big increase in medicare drug benefits.

Freedom - Government's goal should be to maximize Freedom (thereby allowing people to do or accomplish whatever is their own definition of happiness).   Understanding this, I've realized, helps the two camps better communicate. Sometimes, anyway. It's blatantly obvious the OP fits into the humanitarian camp.  This country, unfortunately for believers of the Humanitarian group, was founded on the principle of guaranteeing the ""freedom to PURSUE happiness"". Progressives, such as the OP, are unhappy with that founding principle and are desperately trying to change it to some form of simply ""Guaranteeing happiness.""  As if that's possible.  Once you realize that is what some people want - is a system that tries to ""progress"" society in every way imaginable, and do it's best to ""create"" happiness for everyone, then it's easy to understand.

libertarianmeme,2zhw5h,BlackBlarneyStone,0,Fri Mar 20 04:14:11 2015 UTC,"If it's hard to define freedom and happiness, it's much easier to define the opposite of both freedom and happiness.  Having a shitty, low quality education impedes both of these things.  Having no easy access to clean food or water.  Having no plumbing or sanitation or electricity or internet (invented by DARPA) or garbage pickup.  Having the spectre of a disease or car crash wiping out your extended family's savings.  Having no (public) roads or other transportation.  Having an unreliable or corrupt police force.  Having an insecure food supply because of bad agricultural practices - like the Dust Bowl.  Having no secure currency or banking system so a crash can completely wipe you out.  Having no fire departments, no pollution-regulations, having no way to record land or property transactions, having no way to keep crooks and predators away from the general population.  Having no snow-removal or drug-approvals to prevent scams.    Having ingrained prejudices with no government ban, so if you're born Black or Jewish or Irish or whatever, places can deny you entry.    The list goes on.  If you don't have these things taken care of to a significant extent, I would argue that you're freedom and pursuit of happiness are significantly impeded.  That's true even if individual happiness and freedoms are different.    And note - these are not charity items.  That's not what I'm advocating.  You just have to pay your taxes and not expect these things to be picked up somehow by private industry, which I would argue - they don't do, or if they do it's in the minority of situations and only for the very talented & lucky, and that's not good enough IMHO.  If they do so for the less-than rich, it's because they've been organized and contracted to do so by a government agency.

I generally don't respect force, nor should anyone, unless it's being used to protect life or property.  Third of all, as others here have pointed out, no you could not suddenly swap out all those things, in this  country, at this time, to private enterprise. The libertarian wet-dream can not exist in this country without a total and complete reset (economic, legal, and property) - which isn't going to happen. However, that doesn't mean we can't fight to keep this country from gaining more central authority and statism.   The ideal libertarian government has never existed and has yet to exist. Nor has it ever been attempted. Because of this fact, a lot of the discussion you see here fluxes between idealistic (the kind of country we wish we had) and realistic (the problems we can still maybe fix). I think critics such as yourself rarely, if ever, pick up on the differences so you use much of the idealism to point out how it wouldn't work if implemented today with existing systems -  so the idea itself must suck."

Governments, if they endure, always tend increasingly toward aristocratic forms. No government in history has been known to evade this pattern. And as the aristocracy develops, government tends more and more to act exclusively in the interests of the ruling class — whether that class be hereditary royalty, oligarchs of financial empires, or entrenched bureaucracy.   and   Power bases are very dangerous because they attract people who are truly insane, people who seek power only for the sake of power.   and   Men must want to do things of their own innermost drives. People, not commercial organisations or chains of command, are what make great civilizations work, every civilization depends upon the quality of the individuals it produces. If you overorganize humans, over-legalize them, suppress their urge to greatness — they cannot work and their civilization collapses.   and   Power tends to isolate those who hold too much of it. Eventually, they lose touch with reality... and fall.   and   There exists a limit to the force even the most powerful may apply without destroying themselves. Judging this limit is the true artistry of government. Misuse of power is the fatal sin. The law cannot be a tool of vengeance, never a hostage, nor a fortification against the martyrs it has created. You cannot threaten any individual and escape the consequences.   and   Laws to suppress tend to strengthen what they would prohibit. This is the fine point on which all the legal professions of history have based their job security.    Frank Herbert"

libertarianmeme,2yt6ws,danxmason,4,Fri Mar 13 11:28:20 2015 UTC,"A libertarian does not have the moral authority to make choices for others against their will. You CAN however establish a voluntary charter for people to opt into that sets some guidelines on vaccination. You have to distinguish ethical principle from your specific preference for a market solution, otherwise you dodge the NAP and cannot advocate libertarian principles.  I have a problem with people both on the pro and con side of the vaccination issue to the extent that either side is belittling the other through reactionary statements and not providing good information. It's hard to find a pro-vaccination source that is both informed and neutral, and any time I see them mocking people who question the safety of vaccines I see them adding fuel to the fire.  When you talk about forcing people to have a vaccine, you remove the opportunity to persuade someone as to why they are good. You fail to make the case and you push people away who may be on the fence."
libertarianmeme,2yt6ws,PeppermintPig,-1,Fri Mar 13 14:53:22 2015 UTC,"I agree in general, but I think it's about the immediacy of the danger.  Not being vaccinated only creates the potential for another's death, just like driving a car.  This idea is forcing someone to undergo invasive treatment in order to prevent them from harming someone.  An analogy I've been working with, and correct me if this is off, is as follows.  What if we devised a treatment that prevented people from feeling the effects of alcohol while driving?  This would undoubtedly reduce the harm that is done by people driving drunk.  But, is it right to force everyone to undergo such a treatment just in case they might drive drunk?  I personally don't believe anyone should be forced to do anything until after they've (allegedly) caused harm."
libertarianmeme,2yt6ws,molonlabe88,10,Thu Mar 12 19:45:33 2015 UTC,"Not being vaccinated doesn't mean death, it could mean a host of other issues too.   I think you are overplaying the ""invasive treatment"" Getting a shot barely qualifies on the invasive scale. I mean you are technically correct, but I think the common usage of that word paints a worse picture.   As far as your analogy goes and you not liking punishment until they have caused harm, does that mean if they drive drunk and not cause harm then they shouldn't be punished?   Driving drunk is more of a one-off harm too, while disease doesn't just infect/harm one other person and then stop. It spreads, exponentially too. You medically can find patient zero, but that is only after tremendous amounts of work. So holding someone responsible is next to impossible, plus they are likely to have succumbed to that disease themselves. Considering how many people can be effected, is there any possibility of restitution if that person is even still alive?   Fun Fact* In 1921, 15,000 died without polio vaccine,(US Population of 106 million) that is before world travel and globalization. 10,000 died in 2014 of drunk driving (US population of 316 million)."
libertarianmeme,2yt6ws,Lysander91,-1,Thu Mar 12 20:26:08 2015 UTC,"does that mean if they drive drunk and not cause harm then they shouldn't be punished?   I've heard a lot of libertarians make that argument, actually.  Again, it's about the immediacy.  Such an action puts people in very imminent danger.  Should we be allowed to point guns at people if we don't pull the trigger?  It's tough deciding where to draw that line as far as potentially dangerous actions."

libertarianmeme,2yt6ws,bonked_or_maybe_not,-2,Fri Mar 13 16:47:57 2015 UTC,"Actually that is quite questionable according to the Merck Lead Researcher who designed Merck's own studies used to get it approved.  Let's go to the experts that you might be willing to listen to, like the National Institutes of Health:   Journal editors have expended much time and effort in teasing out how to handle authors' and reviewers' competing interests. They need now to concentrate on their own and those of their employers, lest we reach the dismal scenario described by Marcia Angell: “it is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine” - Source   Watch this segment with Dr. Diane Harper and explain why this vaccine is so important:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSdCxgF0blc  Now before you start with the ""Yeah, a youtube video isn't a source"" this is an interview with Dr. Harper, here is her credentials:   Diane Medved Harper is a professor and chair of the department of Family and Geriatric Medicine at the University of Louisville. From 2009 to 2013 she was a professor at the University of Missouri Kansas City's department of Biomedical and Health Informatics. From 1996 to 2009 she held a clinical, teaching, and research post at Dartmouth Medical School. Her area of expertise is human papillomavirus (HPV) and the diseases associated with it, as well as colposcopy, and she was the principal investigator of the clinical trials of Gardasil and Cervarix, vaccines against HPV.   Now, if you are willing to hear me out this far - why are we forcing a vaccine that has these negative reactions:   Blood & Lymphatic System Disorders 2.9% = 1 in 34 Gastrointestinal Disorders 13.4% = 1 in 7 General & Administration Site Conditions 3.8% = 1 in 33 Immune System Disorders 2.4% =1 in 50 Infections & Infestations 52.9% = 1 in 2 Injury, Poisoning, & Procedural Complications 8.0% =1 in 12 Investigations 11.8% =1 in 9 Musculoskeletal & Connective Tissue Disorders 6.8% =1 in 14 Nervous System Disorders 9.4% = 1 in 10 Pregnancy, Puerperium & Perinatal Conditions 2.0% = 1 in 50 Psychiatric Disorders 4.4% =1 in 22 Renal Disorders 2.7% =1 in 37 Reproductive & Brest Disorders 24.8 % = 1 in 14 Respiratory, Thoracic & Mediastinal Disorders 5.5% = 1 in 18 Skin & Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders 7.4% = 1 in 13   If only ~5% of the 5% of those that ever get the virus end up with potentially getting cancer from it over the course of 40 years?  Could it be that maybe this particular vaccine isn't that effective and is actually harmful, but it makes money for Merck?  You probably won't want to spend $31.50 to read it yourself, but this article in Autoimmunity Review has this lovely bit of info:   “The decision to vaccinate with HPV vaccine is a personal decision, not one that must be made for public health. HPV is not a lethal disease in 95% of the infections; and the other 5% are detectable and treatable in the precancerous stage.”   So again - why is this something that should be forced on people?  Especially when you consider this from ""Quantifying the possible cross-reactivity  risk of an HPV16 vaccine"", published in the Journal of Experimental Therapeutics and Oncology concluded that:  “The number of viral matches and their locations make the occurrence of side autoimmune cross-reactions in the human host following HPV16-based vaccination almost unavoidable.” Source  This is why you don't paint with broad brushes."

Also, Dr. Harper is not the only person outspoken about the questionable necessity of the vaccine - you know what we are actually discussing since the discussion about forcing those that think the risks outweigh the benefits - what about the others like:   “The full extent of the Gardasil scandal needs to be assessed: everyone knew when this vaccine was released on the American market that it would prove to be worthless.  Diane Harper, a major opinion leader in the United States, was one of the first to blow the whistle, pointing out the fraud and scam of it all.I predict that Gardasil will become the greatest medical scandal of all time because at some point in time, the evidence will add up to prove that this vaccine, technical and scientific feat that it may be, has absolutely no effect on cervical cancer and that all the very many adverse effects which destroy lives and even kill, serve no other purpose than to generate profit for the manufacturers. Gardasil is useless and costs a fortune!  In addition, decision-makers at all levels are aware of it! Cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome, paralysis of the lower limbs, vaccine-induced MS and vaccine-induced encephalitis can be found, whatever the vaccine.” – Dr. Bernard Dalbergue Source"

libertarianmeme,2yjq3o,bros_pm_me_ur_asspix,6,Tue Mar 10 22:18:46 2015 UTC,"Just because china ""bans"" videos doesn't mean that the people there can't access them.  Now, TCP/IP wont do it you'll likely need some form of a VPN, but this approach can't really be blocked.  Here's why.  Lets say we have ""restricted website"" that we can't get to from Comcast.  I can setup a ""VPN"" with privateinternetaccess.com  and have them make the request for me and give me the data I want.  This would be encrypted and Comcast would be unable to detect that I'm getting this restricted information and therefore unable to block it.  Okay. lets say they block privateinternetacceess.com.  They are going to do this by IP address.  privateinternetaccess.com can get new ips and Comcast will forever be playing catchup.    However lets just say Comcast is very competent about updating blocking paid VPN services.  I could set up a similar service with a friend with a different ISP.    Going down this path the only way Comcast could effectively block me from accessing restricted content would be to set a list of allowed IPs.  Okay I can access Facebook and Google.  But both of these services rely on a number of constantly changing domains and IPs because they are ad based.  So now facebook and google now have to incur costs to update Comcast's allowed IP.  Also I can no longer work from home or access new internet content etc. etc.  It would be impossible to have a functioning internet with an ""allowed ip"" list.  There are so many things to consider.  No one can have dynamic hosting... P2P games? nope.    Finally lets consider the possibility of Comcast banning the VPN protocols.  Well the answer to that is simple.  Run the VPN protocol through HTTPS.  Comcast wont know what it is and they can't block HTTPS or ssh etc.  These protocols are used far too much.  Hell VPN protocols are used far too much to even consider banning.    Now lets replace Comcast with government.  Well.. same thing.  They can't stop the signal mal.  However if you are caught now instead of losing internet ... you go to jail.    So in conclusion the only way to stop the signal (ban videos) is to shut down the internet entirely.  The FCC can bring nothing to the table to help with a free and open internet.  We've been telling ISPs to fuck off for years now.  Remember when Comcast got bitch slapped over throttling bittorrent?  We have a functioning system in place to keep ISPs in check the FCC's power grab can't benefit the people.  Also, taking note of their use of the term ""lawful"" rather than ""legal"" leads me to believe they are going to try and setup a registration process of some kind.  For example Netflix would have to register with the government in order to become lawful and therefore protected under this bureaucratic decision."

The funds for purchase of distressed assets were mostly redirected to inject capital into banks and other financial institutions while the Treasury continued to examine the usefulness of targeted asset purchases.   Both foreign and domestic banks are included in the program. The Federal Reserve also extended help to American Express, whose bank-holding application it recently approved.

I don't think anyone here would say that if we were directly attacked, we shouldn't retaliate. The question then becomes, when should we step in? If they attack Canada do we step in? England? Iraq? Syria? Do you watch your neighbor being assaulted by armed thugs and do nothing? What if they are cutting the heads off Americans, Canadians, Englishmen, Iraqis, and Syrians alike? Doesn't that make a it a world problem? Shouldn't the world step in and say: ""Nope, you continue to violate the non-aggression principle in unacceptable ways, and refuse to stop, you've revoked your right to exist."" And if the world is unwilling, we might have to go it alone.  I'm sorry, as philosophical as anyone can ever get, it really comes down to: ""The only people that can stop bad guys with guns are good guys with guns."" I think this comic has a bit of right thinking and a bit of wrong thinking. They are right that we shouldn't glorify war, we don't need a GI Joe for our children to watch and go: ""Mommy, I want to kill people when I grow up!"" War is a necessary evil, it's bad, it is the ultimate last resort, we should avoid it when we can, but we can't always avoid it, when a belligerent force continues to attack despite our efforts to communicate and mitigate, we must destroy it's capacity to harm.  Where I think they may have got it wrong, or at least unintentionally made the wrong impression, is the whole ""soldiers aren't heroes"" shit that I hear so often in this subreddit. Really, this is like the only subreddit where I still hear that shit (I heard the leftist screaming it all during the Bush years but they all quit when they got a leftist president who supports war.) I don't care how anti-government, how anti-war, how anti-american, anybody is, when someone goes and risks their lives, and suffers all the psychological trauma, and fights and kills for the interests of our nation, they deserve some respect. It just pisses me off when I hear people disrespecting our soldiers, I mean, I'm not one, I never served, I went into healthcare, I take care of the poor bastards coming back with PTSD and missing limbs, people who don't get to sleep at night and have to be retrained on how to love their spouses and children again, it pisses me off so much when people say shit like: ""They were sheep in the oil war!"" Fuck you, they didn't go to get rich off oil in Iraq, the got paid next to nothing and military benefits suck, and they went because they love this country, show a little respect.  Half this subreddit seems to think terrorism is a scam, like they aren't really burning people alive, cutting their heads off, and stoning them to death. You can scream military industrial complex all day long, but the truth of the matter is, if we don't stop them there, we're going to have to fight them here. I don't think there is anything in libertarian philosophy that suggest that if someone is actively seeking to destroy your way of life and attacking your people, and you've already exhausted the diplomatic options, you shouldn't take them the fuck out before they hurt anyone else."

I'm not even talking about the recent ones, I'm talking about stuff like the Banana Wars and the Panama debacle, that kind of stuff.  The problem is, anytime leadership is goading people into a war (in any nation under any leader) they are going to sell it to the people as a necessary self-defence thing. Sometimes it is. Sometimes it isn't. I find that very few people are willing to take on the arduous task of being informed enough to tell the difference, so they rely on the words of one talking head or another. A lot of people here on the libertarian subreddits are waking up to the fact they've been lied to and manipulated their whole lives, so when people tell them ""we can have a society without wars"" they actually believe it.  It's like that song Imagine by John Lennon, I hear so many people quote that song without thinking about the deaper meaning. When he envisions a world without war he's also envisioning a world with ""nothing to live or die for."" Sure, you can have peace, if you're world is a shithole with nothing worth fighting over, yea, we can tear down all the buildings and factories and go back and live in woods and caves, and we might have peace, but I doubt it, I figure it wouldn't be long before the tribes are fighting over the best woods and the best caves.  The truth is, if we're going to live under libertarian philosophy, that is, ""do whatever you want as long as you're not violating anyone's life, liberty, or property"" then we are going to have to have someone to enforce that, and when the entity that is violating our life, liberty, or property is an rogue state or a terrorist group, and they won't respond to diplomacy, that's when the gruesome and unsightly business of war must begin. I think a lot of people have failed to actually think that through."

I don't believe in 'stimulus' but I can make vastly better arguments for it than the statist in the cartoon. For example:   'the roads we're building will make travel from point a to point b more practical and this will mean much lower transportation costs and will tend to increase economic activity between the two places. So, you see in the short run we will see jobs from building roads and in the long run we will see new jobs created because of a general increase in trade' or   'we're really just looking for a short term benefit here, we think that by shoring up the economy now people will gain confidence down the road and increase their spending which will in turn leave employers feeling confident enough to hire.'   I don't happen to believe that these arguments are really very strong but they're actual arguments which require refutation and can't be reasonably characterized as 'heh well if ppl still need jobs will build more roads'.

Edit:  I realize you have already deleted that last comment where you claimed to be Jewish and called me a racist, but I just want to add the Hitler didn't take away guns from anyone, not even the Jews, he just excluded them when he relaxed the laws in 1938.

Capitalism means the free market, or a market without an actor (governmental, or not) who can use force against you. I know socialists will often conflate the free market and the state, but the free market can exist without the state.  So my question to you is, how can a free, voluntary market be oppressive? If we lived in a stateless, free society, you could operate without capitalism. You could start a community of like minded individuals who reject markets, and wish to live communially. And as long as you didn't bother me, I won't bother you."

Instead I try to see the best and worst they all have to offer.   Capitalism means the free market, or a market without an actor (governmental, or not) who can use force against you.   Perfect I can work with this. Lets dive into the deep-end and work our way shallow.  Three prominent philosophers come to mind when thinking about the origins of our liberal democracies (I assume you are in the US and I am in Canada); they are Hobbes, Lock, and Rousseau. In their books Leviathan, Two Treaties of Government, and The Social Contract, they wanted to understand the origins of the state, and the nature of our rights. They all came to recognize the same reality, that life is nasty, short and brutish because we are all in a struggle to have power over each other.   What do we mean by power? In political science power is simply defined as ones ability to get what they want. In a world with scarce resources, it is greed that drives us to survive, and so we are more than willing to kill another to get what we want. In the state of nature it is often what we need to survive. To be at the top means to have power over everyone else. You are the hunter not the prey, although that is not true because there are many who want to be in your position...and the power struggle goes not.   The state comes to exist out of mans desire to live in peace. Submit your rights to a common power in hopes of creating a condition of equality that is not present in the state of nature. Everyone is equally coerced to stay in line, and if you step out of line some one will come after you simply for the fact that you did not stay in line.   The core objective of government then is to guide the state in creating and maintaing a condition of peace. To achieve that the state must defend itself from outside forces, and to maintain a greater condition of equality within itself than in the state of nature.   After centuries of war and peace in liberal democracies, we have gradually attempted to increase the degree of equality to avoid conflict. Social safety net on the domestic front, and the International Organizations on the foreign stage.   Free markets ultimately leads to violent conflict every time because it is too...free. Without government people will kill each other until government is formed, whether it be the result of those wanting to solidify their position at the top, or because people in a community need security. With government leading a pure capitalist system, you get socialist / communist revolutions. Because lets not forget that money gives the ability to get what you want, hence giving you power. The powerless will rise.   This is not to say capitalism does not bring about prosperity. Only a fool would argue against the numbers we have gathered. I have presented to you the political science perspective."

The state-owned petroleum companies that are common in oil-rich developing countries (such as Aramco in Saudi Arabia or PDVSA in Venezuela) are examples of government monopolies created through nationalization of resources and existing firms; the United States Postal Service is an example of a coercive monopoly created through laws that ban potential competitors such as UPS or FedEx from offering competing services (in this case, first-class and standard (formerly called ""third-class"") mail delivery).1     Interesting: Government-granted monopoly | Government monopoly | Federal Trade Commission | Democracy: The God That Failed   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Yes the free market should be able to take care of itself, but the government does have a role to fill and sometimes will need to step in when needed. It also needs to step back out when it has served it's purpose.  On the other hand companies like Google have done things like roll out Google Fiber to get around there monopolistic business practices and force competition. Google has shown they do not want to be an ISP, but they want to force ISP's to increase bandwidth and lower prices so the consumer can use Google's services.

All of this thanks to the free market.   You do know that cable ISPs are granted local monopolies by the state, right?   Content providers were getting shaken down for special connection fees   Yes, but internet infrastructure costs money. End users will pay for this no matter what, but the question is will they pay content providers or their internet providers? The FCC has decided that we will pay ISPs, not content providers because it's now illegal for ISPs to charge content providers. This isn't by definition a ""good"" thing since to end-users basically nothing has changed. For Google and Netflix this makes all the difference because they don't want to be the bad guys charging their customers more.   Now, it's true some good could come of this: ISPs' monopolies could have been exploited to push their own content (not a ton of evidence this was happening yet), but we've also possibly created problems in the future.  We don't really know what the internet will look like in 5 or 10 years and reducing innovation options just because we already made bad policy decisions in the past with regard to monopolies could backfire.

libertarianmeme,2x9kb7,el_drako,2,Fri Feb 27 04:51:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is what they did to fix the problem.   Because Netflix is so popular, with 33 million customers in the U.S. alone, it’s a prodigious generator of internet traffic, accounting for nearly 30% of all the bits moving around, according to Sandvine. To get all that traffic to folks like you and me, the company relies on a something called content-delivery networks (CDNs) that cache its content broadly around the country. Some of it is stored with third parties, companies like Level 3 and Limelight. Much of it is stored by Netflix itself, but not on infrastructure it completely controls. Netflix has its own CDN that exists on capacity the company leases from infrastructure providers like Cogent Communications. It also has equipment inside the networks of some internet providers, including Google Fiber, RCN and Cablevision. Netflix calls this Open Connect but what’s important about it is that by getting the content burrowed deep inside the networks, it gets clear of as many traffic jams as possible on the way to you. - Source   And more   What also makes this complicated is that Netflix is only highlighting the things that benefit their argument and isn’t telling the whole story. In some cases, they are also making statements that aren’t accurate. Netflix likes to make it sound like they have no choice when it comes to sending their traffic into the ISPs networks, when in fact, they have many choices. The transit market is extremely competitive, with at least a dozen major providers who offer transit services at different price points and with different SLAs. Netflix could use multiple providers to connect to ISPs and could also use third party CDNs like Akamai, EdgeCast and Limelight, who are already connected to ISPs, to deliver their traffic. In fact, this is how Netflix delivered 100% of their traffic for many, many years, using third-party CDNs. Netflix likes to make it sound like there is only one way to deliver videos on the Internet when in fact, there are multiple ways. No one who understands how the Internet works would debate this.  Netflix’s whole argument is that ISPs are purposely letting their peering points get congested but what Netflix isn’t talking about is some of the stuff they have done behind the scenes to make matters worse. Saturating a peering point can easily be prevented if you buy transit from multiple providers, which Netflix does. But the reason Cogent is the one transit provider we always seem to hear about is because Netflix continued to push their traffic through Cogent even though they knew it was already congested. Even though Netflix was buying transit from multiple providers, it wasn’t routing around capacity issues, like all the other CDNs do. So why did Netflix continue to push their traffic through Cogent even though they knew the link was congested? That practice is abnormal for any CDN to do as it impacts the quality of the video being delivered. Remember, no ISP decides how the traffic comes into their network or which transit providers Netflix uses. When you use third party CDNs, they also buy transit from multiple providers so that the can route traffic in real time around places where there is congestion.  In reality, the blame could fall on Netflix for continuing to send traffic over a link they know is congested, when alternatives exist in the market. The blame could also fall on the transit provider who sold Netflix capacity that they know they can’t deliver based on their current peering arrangements. It could also be that the broadband service provider isn’t upgrading a link that is still under peering compliance, per their peering policy. Laying the blame on the ISP isn’t always the case or always accurate. It may be at times, but the company that should be blamed will be different depending on the business situation of the companies involved.  So as much as Netflix wants to make this into a net neutrally issue, it’s a business issue. Netflix has alternatives, they chose not to use them. One could also argue that, by Netflix not routing around the performance issues with Cogent, the end result is that it forces the ISP to take angry calls from consumers. And if the ISP gets enough of those calls, maybe the ISP would then agree to join Netflix’s Open Connect program and allow Netflix to come into the ISPs last mile to place their own servers. Netflix’s motives in this whole argument is to protect their business, which is fine, but then they should not portray their argument as one where they are “fighting for the Internet”.  In Netflix’s post they said that Cablevision is “already practicing strong net neutrality”, but neglects to remind us that Cablevision is in Netflix’s Open Connect program. So is that what Netflix defines as “strong” net neutrality, any ISP that agrees to Netflix’s terms? And those that don’t join Open Connect and don’t agree to Netflix’s terms, are those the ISP that have “weak” net neutrality principles? To me, that sounds more like Netflix defining who is “strong” or “weak” based on Netflix’s own business terms and not true net neutrality. Netflix also calls out Comcast as “supporting weak net neutrality”, but the fact is Comcast is the only ISP that legally even has to follow the rules, due to their purchase of NBC.  Netflix also mentions in their post that strong net neutrality prevents ISPs from charging a toll for interconnection to services like “Netflix, YouTube, or Skype” and intermediaries such as “Cogent, Akamai or Level 3″. So why aren’t Google, Akamai, Yahoo!, AOL, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Apple, Limelight Networks, EdgeCast and other CDNs and content owners who have built their own CDNs also complaining as Netflix is? Netflix is the only major content owner whom we have heard from, in a public forum, that thinks interconnection should be covered under net neutrality rules. It’s interesting to note that Netflix mentions YouTube by name, but the vast majority of Google’s content is already delivered inside the last mile via GGC (Google Global Cache). Not every ISP, but the majority of them, have been happy to work with Google and place Google caches within their network. So one has to ask themselves why Google has success working with ISPs, but Netflix isn’t. Source and A LOT more details from StreamingMedia.com"

No. The reason Netflix was slow was because they were being forced to follow normal routing, instead of having their 150TB servers with the most popular content inside the ISP data center.  Your example is like UPS or FedEx charging rent to Amazon if they wanted to use warehouse space owned by FedEx or UPS and also wanted to charge for delivery.

I am worried that small sites (like /r/libertarian would be if we were a stand alone site) would be required to pay exorbitant fees to even be broadcast, and that would effectively silence the small political movements in this nation, and we would have no other real options because almost every ISP runs a virtual monopoly."

I guess what I'm getting at, I believe in the power of a constitution and a set of laws and amendments to keep the government in check. I don't think some of my peers do.  I can see why, honestly, they've lived through at least 14 years of the constitution being ""Just A Goddamned Piece Of Paper."" But I've been around longer, I remember when political leaders lived in fear of crossing the line and doing something unconstitutional, and going the way of Nixon.

Peering is normally free because you both get the benefit of upstream offload and billing wouldn't make sense because your use and the other network's use would basically cancel out any benefit.  With Netflix etc. they are pushing a huge amount of data down stream, but not taking anything back upstream, so they get lopsided benefit.

You know that in a state of war, natural rights are entirely unprotected, and thieves/gangs/mafias arise to take advantage of people. In order to protect natural rights, a military is required. And pretty much all of human experience suggests that taxation is required to avoid people freeloading off of the protection being provided by the military. Even if you don't have taxation, people need to pay into it. The difference between what I'm talking about and socialism is that the socialists have no interest in natural rights. You might say I don't either, but my argument is that I want to maximize freedom. If the taxation is paying into military bloat (not buying substantial protection) then it is as evil as a mafia protection racket."

libertarianmeme,2wymp0,CrossSwords,7,Tue Feb 24 14:42:35 2015 UTC,Do you have a source where you're getting that 20% figure? That seems very low. And does that reflect poor practice by the handler (e.g. giving the dog a cue where he wants the dog to hit?) or is that just purely the dog's own error? I'm curious.
libertarianmeme,2wymp0,ThePeaceMaker707,1 point,Tue Feb 24 15:37:41 2015 UTC,"Nothing stopping a cop from just saying the dog indicated. The dog can't say he did not indicate. Its total bullshit that dogs are used by the police. These dogs don't get an option, they don't live normal lives, they are stuck in a kennel whenever they aren't working. They get stressed out working long hours, they will straight up bite people if you move too quickly around them due to their training. I'm kind of surprised animals rights groups don't make a bigger stink about it. Maybe they do and I just haven't heard about it, but I think training police dogs borderline animal cruelty.   Cops shoot dogs all the time, even little ones in a crate just because they are barking. But if i was being wrongfully arrested and a dog was present and I defended myself I would still be fucked by ""assaulting a police officer"""
libertarianmeme,2wymp0,zosobell,6,Tue Feb 24 17:04:52 2015 UTC,"Just curious, but have you ever been around a police dog? Do you know any K9 handlers, or at least stopped and had a conversation with one? I don't think they're ill-treated at all. They certainly live a different lifestyle than a house pet, but that doesn't mean they're stressed out. Even with well-cared for pets, living in a house and getting every meal provided for, and fenced in a backyard except for walks, that's not normal either. Those K9s are working breeds, they enjoy that shit. Their training is very impressive to say the least, and it's my opinion that most of the ""bad stuff"" that K9's do is due to poor handling by the officer. Not really the dog's fault, his partner is just a dick.  And yeah, like you said, the cop can get the dog to indicate wherever he wants (or more accurately, get the dog to do the action associated with a real hit, even though the dog doesn't smell drugs) so he can articulate in his police report that the dog showed the sign.   EDIT: Also, I think K9 officers being kept in a kennel is more of an exception than a rule. It's my understanding that most police dogs live at home with the officer."
libertarianmeme,2wymp0,ThePeaceMaker707,2,Tue Feb 24 17:59:32 2015 UTC,"I was security forces in the USAF which is basically the police force for the Air Force. I can only speak to what I saw in regards to the way the USAF does things, never trained to be a handler myself. I met probably 20 plus dog handlers in my time, however. I have friends that have gone on to train to handle the dogs. I have seen dogs being trained, i've worked side by side with handlers and their dogs.  I'm not saying they are ill treated by their handler, just that the conditions aren't really the best for the dog. The dogs I  saw were kept in kennels whenever they were not working, I know this because I have seen this. I have been to the kennels. I am no expert but I just do not think it is right for the dogs to be put to work like that then put up.   We were taught to be very careful around the dogs because they are trained to attack when they feel their handler is in danger, even the handlers would get bit and from what they said, pretty often. Some dogs were great, others were terrors. I would say for the dogs that were terrors, they hated being working military dogs and was not a good life for them."
libertarianmeme,2wymp0,zosobell,2,Tue Feb 24 23:36:34 2015 UTC,"Upvote for your insight! I'll have to say that's different than the experience I've had, which is admittedly less. I know a handful of cops and have met a few of the K9 officers they work with. So I have that go on, plus what they told to me about the industry. And they are civilian police, not military.  The dogs don't seem stressed out, they just seem focused and alert, but not unhappy. And these dogs all live at home with the officers. Also, I'm not sure what these dogs' occupations were. They were ""patrol canines"", I assume drug sniffing is part of their job.  The dogs definitely had an aggressive side if in a tense situation, but otherwise just calm but alert. One thing the handlers told me is ""never get inbetween a police dog and a suspect he's chasing"" because in their mind, you then become the subject to be chased. Apparently there's not really any way to train against that.  Anyway, I know that at least the K9 officers I met (who were all good guys) all loved their dogs, and seem to strongly believe in what they do and that their dogs are living good lives. Then again, not all cops are good people, so I'm sure there are quite a few scumbag handlers too. I can't speak on them."

libertarianmeme,2wymp0,CrossSwords,2,Tue Feb 24 19:31:21 2015 UTC,"I highly suspect that is the case most of the time, since dogs don't racially profile!  Likely scenario: Officer stops a car full of hispanics (or whatever). Decides he would like to search their vehicle. Deploys the K9, gives some subtle cue (possibly even unknowingly!) that makes the dog react with his ""indication action"" because that's what he's learned (again, could even be unintentional. maybe). Cop uses that as justification for a search. Good enough for the Sarge when the police report comes across his desk. And in the end, nothing happens to correct this because the system is fucking crooked, and nobody else cares except the person whose rights were violated (yada yada, you know the rest)  I bet my bottom dollar that these dogs are very significantly more accurate in training scenarios."

We were taught about the libertarian and capitalist leanings prior to the great depression in Canada, and the Marxist / Communist / Socialist uprisings that followed. Intermission was WW2 along with totalitarian / authoritarian regimes of Europe. Back to influences of Keynesianism and socialism after the war along with the cold war. We're taught to see the negative and positive roles different ideologies played in our countries history. Almost had a socialist revolution in BC prior to the second great war, but in the end we got public healthcare (in a very capitalistic fashion), employment insurance, unions, public education, equalization payments, and the NDP.

I see this analytic problem generally appear in anarcho-capitalist thought: the State's version is bad, ipso facto, the market version would be better.  For instance, many anarcho-libertarians whine about the NSA's surveillance capabilities, but Bob Murphy's Chaos Theory argues that insurance companies would have even greater access into our private lives.  Analogously, the public production of police might appear ""militarized,"" but that in itself does not prove that a market alternative would be less armed (once again, the image itself just shows some dudes walking around... not police brutality of any sort).  For a private security force that appears equally threatening, see here: http://www.nixonsecurityllc.com/page6.html."

Libertarianism is inherently against all of them.  Liberals and the Democratic Party might be full of business-restricting regulation and spend a lot on taxes, but they seem more concerned with the civil rights of individuals in this era, even if there is a slew of rhetoric that contradicts it (Affirmative Action, for example).  Libertarianism has flourished in popularity recently, and while it's modern movement stems from small-government conservatives, a very large number are also from former liberals that want to see civil rights looked after the way many of those ""self-described conservatives"" say they're in favor of eroding, without the massive overhead in taxation and red-tape the Democratic party appears to offer.

They can be armed with guns, too, which are something of a force-multiplier against unarmed dudes, no matter how strong or well-versed in kung fu they are.  ""But,"" you say, ""killing and maiming your slaves is awfully economically inefficient."" The historical evidence would indicate otherwise, as would good sense -- the threat of violence is a pretty good motivator, after all. That's what kept the whole system spinning for over three-hundred years, despite the occasional mass rebellion.  And the free market was more than willing to comply with the will of private citizens when illegal slave smuggling continued long past the ban placed on international slave trading in 1808. The big bad evil state certainly played a role in enforcing the slave system, but it was a system created by and for the marketplace in order to take advantage of the unique American problem of way too much land and not enough cheap labor to make it profitable. It certainly didn't take the efforts of a totalitarian state constructing formal death camps (it happened in that golden era of classical liberty, the 19th Century!) -- all it took was the efforts of private citizens constructing their own mini death camps."
libertarianmeme,2wbpc8,zuludown888,1 point,Thu Feb 19 08:15:03 2015 UTC,"The threat of violence isa good motivator when the violence can be enforced. At this point, you already leed several private guards plus accomodation for your slaves. Note that you need to pay them fairly well or they'll turn against you (remember, no calling the state, adding one level of indirection issonly playing withethe rule). That is expensive. Additionally, your threat of violence are mostly unenforceable as your slave will runaway. You'll need an army to patrol the area and threat not only your slave but anyone that would help them. You are not addressing this cost in your post, but it can't be ignored: maintaining an army is extremely expensive.  Now, immagine that you could offload the cost of the army to everybody else, including people that do not have slave (the vast majority). Now that is interesting !  Countries that still practice slavery are economic shitholes, that should have hinted you."
libertarianmeme,2wbpc8,deadalnix,1 point,Thu Feb 19 17:29:26 2015 UTC,"Now, immagine that you could offload the cost of the army to everybody else, including people that do not have slave (the vast majority). Now that is interesting !   Yes, turns out, you don't really have the ability to claim ""property"" without a system of laws and government to enforce that claim. So if we want to take this all the way down, slavery is impossible on any great scale without an overall social structure to back it up. But that's really not a libertarian argument -- it's an Anarchist (real Anarchist) one. Protection of property is the cornerstone of what the state is ""supposed"" to do, after all, and it just has to decide what kinds of property are going to be allowed.  In other words, if you're willing to make the argument that slavery could not exist on some level without the state (on this very basic level of simply enforcing property laws), then the reality is that capitalism as we understand it could not exist without it, either, because without that basic level of the state then there is no property to buy and trade. There is no industry. I mean you don't have to be Thomas Hobbes to see how property claims are going to work in a ""state of nature.""  So my advice to you is to refrain from making that argument unless you really want to start talking about the autonomist cooperatives that will replace our system of private ownership when we finally get around to abolishing the state.  Now to address your smaller claims about the economic unfeasability of slavery -- it's useful here to look at the historical record. See, for about a century before slavery finally ended in North America, you had people writing about how it was on its way out because it was no longer ""profitable."" Usually these people were being willfully ignorant. The Mississippi Valley in the 1840s had the highest concentration of millionaires in the world, after all, and that wealth wasn't built on hippie farming collectives.  ""But,"" you say, ""wouldn't those slaves run away?"" Of course they did. But thanks to geographic isolation and an entire society that was willing to enforce slave owners' property claims (and if you're going to argue that the issue isn't just THE STATE but any system of hierarchy, again I direct you to left-wing anarchists rather than libertarianism), most slaves didn't make it very far. The system was of course expensive (and impoverishing to Southern white society outside of the planter class), but that expense paled in comparison to the vast quantity of wealth being created by slave labor.  ""But what about the costs of slave labor beyond enforcing the system?"" Well the good news there is that the free market was more than willing to provide insurance on slaves, just as they were any other property. If you owned slaves, the insurance industry was very happy to sell you insurance on their bodies, so that if they died or were crippled you could just get another.  And for the most part, the slaves took care of themselves. Medical care, food, and housing was pretty much a non-issue, because the vast majority of slave owners operating large plantations left the slaves grow their own food and take care of themselves on their own time (that ""own time"" of course depended on the whims of the enslaver). All you really needed was enough space somewhere on your plantation to erect a few shacks for them to live in. After that, hey they paid for themselves.  Slavery in the United States can in no way be pushed onto some amorphous BIG BAD STATE that sauntered in ex nihilo and instituted slavery. The history of slavery puts the lie to that idea: the first African slaves in what is today the USA were imported privately to Jamestown as a replacement for indentured workers who had the unfortunate quality of being under the protection of the government. An indentured servant from England had all the rights of an Englishman. You couldn't maim him or kill him without the authority of the state. An African slave, however, had no such protections. He was simply property. That's a lot easier to deal with, and the Free Market jumped at the chance to get some cheaper, more easily-controlled labor.   Countries that still practice slavery are economic shitholes, that should have hinted you.   (1) Slavery still exists in the United States, though it is hidden from the public eye and actively opposed by the government. The Free Market, uh, finds a way.  (2) The areas where slavery exists in quantity, despite its abolition, are distinguished because of their weak states being unable to enforce the ban, or else a lack of political will (thanks to the influence of economic beneficiaries) stopping the state from stamping the practice out. See, for instance, debt slavery in India, an institution that has been formally outlawed for some sixty-plus years, but which continues illegally in rural areas where the Indian federal government has difficulty getting anything done at all, let alone destroying an ancient system of oppression. That's certainly not an argument for less government -- it's an argument for more."

Second, that state is the number one violator of property rights. Claiming that the state is necessary for property enforcement is a ridiculous claim.   I encourage you to really think about how you'll protect private property without a state. A property claim is necessarily a claim that you have something, and nobody else can have it without your permission. Without some sort of force backing up that claim, your claim is not real -- it has no way to be protected, and your claim of a ""right"" to such property is just a sad joke.  One way to hold onto property is through sheer force of arms, and that's exactly what you have to do in a society (say, one without a functioning government) where banditry and violence is common. But this is rather inefficient (as you might recall from all the stuff about ""how are you going to keep the slaves in line?""), and so the state exists as a way to enforce ""rightful"" claims to property and to adjudicate their disputes without the use of private armies. The state has the ""monopoly on violence"" -- the ability to use force with impunity -- and so they can both protect your ""right"" to a piece of property and settle disputes.  If you think that property exists independent of some ability to apply violence to protect that property, then you are a complete fool who has drunk far too much of the ancap koolaid."

You'll find out that, indeed, it is much easier to argue against what you invent rather than against what is written.  Second, you assume that, somehow, the government is a solution to protect property. By any measurable metric it isn't, the government being the number 1 violator of property rights.  Third, you seems now to agree that holding onto property is expensive (would that mean you were full of shit on the slavery thing and are now realizing it ? We'll never know !). And indeed it is. But you fail to address how the government can achieve this with greater efficiency than the alternative.

libertarianmeme,2wbpc8,deadalnix,0,Thu Feb 19 23:21:30 2015 UTC,"Once again your point do not make any sense.    Well, maybe if you're dumb or can't speak English or buy into a particularly ridiculous worldview.   Nowhere in this claim it is said that violence is unnecessary to defend your property   And I never said that you said that. What I am saying is that there is no state of affairs in which you can have property without use of force (you say that you agree on this), and given the extreme costs involved with every single person forming their own personal army in order to defend their ""rights"" to property (you also agree on this), governments are a solution that human societies have come up with to mitigate that cost and end up with a real right to private property (you disagree on this because you are foolish and believe ridiculous things).   Second, you assume that, somehow, the government is a solution to protect property. By any measurable metric it isn't, the government being the number 1 violator of property rights.   No I think I've pretty conclusively demonstrated that property ""rights"" as something other than simply your ability to stand with a loaded shotgun in front of the bandits coming to take your house exists only under a government willing to defend that supposed ""right."" You are simply stamping your feet and saying ""NO NO NO you don't get it -- the state VIOLATES our property!"" as if this is any real argument. Even if the state were to violate your property rights, since there is no real property right outside of the state, it remains the only guarantor of property worth a damn. Your only alternative is a world without a state, in which case good luck when the bandits come to take your house. You don't have a ""right"" then in any meaningful sense, because the bandits have as much ""right"" as you do -- the right of conquest.   But you fail to address how the government can achieve this with greater efficiency than the alternative   The alternative being ""no state,"" in which every single person has as much claim to property as any other person, and we've already discussed why humans gave that up a long time ago.  Now to bring this all back to slavery -- the point is this: Slavery does not (and did not) exist ""because of"" government any more so than any other form of property right does, so if your argument is that slavery would not exist independent of the big bad state, you are being very silly, because that is only true in the sense that without a government there would not be a thing we could really call ""property"" (you just have an object that you claim to be in your possession and which you are willing to fight over), which is definitely not something that a supposed free-market proponent would want. It's like saying that Slavery wasn't caused by the Free Market -- it was caused by the presence of matter in the universe. It's technically true, but it is a totally worthless observation that you should rightly be ridiculed for making.   So the example of American Slavery as a free-market death camp stands."

Slavery had been practiced in British North America from early colonial days, and was recognized in the Thirteen Colonies at the time of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. When the United States was founded, even though some free persons of color were present, the status of slave was largely related historically to being of African descent, creating a system and legacy in which race played an influential role. After the Revolutionary War, abolitionist laws and sentiment gradually spread in the Northern states, while the rapid expansion of the cotton industry from 1800 led to the Southern states to depend on slavery as integral to their economy, and they attempted to extend it as an institution into the new Western territories. The United States was polarized by slavery into slave and free states along the Mason-Dixon Line, which separated Maryland (slave) and Pennsylvania (free).

Anti-semitism was strong in Europe, and Germans after the economic disaster they had past the first world war and the humiliation by other nations, just wanted some from the inside to blame -  because according to them, it can't be that they lost. it can't be that their economics doesn't goes up.  so.. blame the Jews.  The government just made the murder much more organized."

libertarianmeme,2vs9r0,TheSwitchBlade,19,Fri Feb 13 20:35:27 2015 UTC,"The government contracted scientists to develop a tool that allowed file sharing between research labs and universities.  It wasn't until someone else (not the government) recognized the potential for commerce that the Internet exploded.  Similarly, just because the government may have contracted scientists for a way to eliminate fragile vacuum tubes (used in radios for the military), which lead to the transistor and later lead to the microchip, doesn't mean the ""government invented the iPhone"".  It's a common misconception that new inventions are completely new- from the ground-up.  Instead, inventions are most often a re-tooling of existing technology.  Either using it for a purpose it wasn't originally intended, or combining two pieces of technology to invent a third, ""new"" technology."

libertarianmeme,2vs9r0,EternalArchon,3,Fri Feb 13 21:04:58 2015 UTC,"Individuals seeking profit would not have spent the money on the moon landing(at least so soon) and there is a definite case they would't have for nuclear weapons which led to nuclear power.   Well, the military commissioned private enterprise for the creation of accurate rocketry which lead to the moon landing. So the impetus of rocket technology was already started - can we really say that had the government not launched the lunar projects then private enterprise wouldn't have either?  I don't think we can say that with certainty.  Just as post-it notes were an invention based off a failed attempt (the search for a super-strong glue), who can say if some other unforeseen chain of events would have transpired in the absence of the lunar program that would have lead private enterprise there?    The vast majority of satellites orbiting Earth now are for private telecommunications companies.    As for nuclear energy...?  I'm on the fence about that one too. The modern age has always seen a continuous search for cheap, efficient energy.  And physicists (as I understand it) had already discovered the notion of leveraging the atom for huge amounts of energy.  I don't think the US government came to the scientists and said ""build us a nuclear bomb""; they went to the scientists and said ""build us an enormous bomb of heretofore unheard of magnitude"" and the scientists said ""well, we might be able to harness the power of the atom"".  So had the route not been taken to build bombs, I think nuclear energy would still have been invented.  Possibly sooner and more widely embraced, even, since the social stigma of anything ""nuclear"" being horrific wouldn't exist.  Besides, there has been no development of harnessing nuclear fusion for weapons (yet), but scientists are nearing the ability to harness it for energy production.    But this is all just speculation.  Woulda, coulda, shoulda.    Still, an interesting thought experiment.  probably better done while high."
libertarianmeme,2vs9r0,brettdavids,3,Fri Feb 13 22:17:02 2015 UTC,I think the point that's being missed is that not all government programs are bad.  Being against big government doesn't mean we're against all government.  Many if not most of the technology advances of the last half century can be directly attributed to government defense spending.  I don't have a problem with our government collecting and spending money on certain things.  It's when we build a system that redistributes wealth or gives incentives to not be a productive member of society that we have a real problem.

libertarianmeme,2vs9r0,brettdavids,2,Sat Feb 14 01:49:54 2015 UTC,"and there is a definite case they would't have for nuclear weapons which led to nuclear power   To the contrary, the applications of nuclear science for energy production were immediately apparent to those who discovered it. There was plenty of non-government support for abundant zero-emission energy. But government wanted bombs. By choosing who to subsidize, government tilted the nuclear power industry in favor of inefficient and dangerous nuclear plants whose fuel could be refined into weapons.  And then there's the mushroom clouds. And Chernobyl. Nuclear hasn't been able to shake off this stigma of mass destruction ever since. Even the nuclear magnetic resonance imaging device had to drop the ""n"" word to get people to use it.  Nuclear energy has been a force for the de-proliferation of nuclear weapons because it's by far more profitable to electrify cities with your Plutonium than it is to just have it sit in a silo waiting for doomsday.  Far from government being the only possible provider of impetus for space and nuclear technologies, government took hold of technological evolution and forced it down deadly and wasteful rabbit trails that set real progress back for decades. If you want to know why human spaceflight was such a snore for the past 30+ years, look no further than the Shuttle program. Why invent the Falcon-9, the Dragon capsule, or self-retrieving rocket stages if NASA is willing to subsidize the wasteful but versatile Shuttle to get your payload into orbit?"
libertarianmeme,2vs9r0,YesYesLibertarians,5,Sat Feb 14 13:50:05 2015 UTC,"Sure, it is completely true. I don't know what the standard reply to this would be. The way I look at things, if you steal over a third of the money of the most prosperous nation on earth through taxation, then give it to private defense contractors, you're probably going to get some pretty amazing, innovative stuff. Might get an atom bomb, might get a B-2 bomber, might get an internet. Doesn't mean the free market wouldn't have produced the internet on its own. Doesn't make theft right.   A scientist invented the internet. Not a politician. There are scientists with or without the government, and without, a whole lot of scientific research will be unleashed and we will probably see innovation on a scale undreamt of. So you can say, if we didn't have the government, we might not have the internet. Might be true. But the innovations that we would have gotten in the past 50 years, had we not had the state intervening in the market, who knows what we have lost in that process. Who knows what we are losing right now, and in the future."

It seems to me that they have some sort of back-room deals to fuck their customer in every way.  What would a libertarian answer do?  To completely de-regulate these big businesses would mean that they would start doing whatever they want to destroy any and all competition (they're trying to do so with Google Fiber but failing because Google is too big for them to handle at the moment).  These guys have bullied competition and customers to the point where they have way too much power and money to push the internet into better technology (like when these telecomm companies promised fiber after taking ""donations""...which we never got).  These companies broke promises and piss people off with no one able to do anything about it.  These dreadful companies wouldn't exist if they had competition because of how awful they are.  So now what is there to do other than get a bigger power (in this case Big Brother) and lay a smackdown?  I don't want regulation from the government becuase they would find ways to fuck with us and companies, but they are the only thing to stop this madness in the ISP market.  Unless you suggest everyone going to smaller companies, which is not a valid answer because the smaller ISPs suck in speed and prices."

libertarianmeme,2vn43q,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Feb 14 23:18:52 2015 UTC,"Nazi Germany:       Nazi Germany and the Third Reich are common names for the German Reich from 1933 to 1945, when it was under control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist totalitarian state which controlled nearly all aspects of life. Nazi Germany ceased to exist after the Allied Forces defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.  Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic Paul von Hindenburg on 30 January 1933. The Nazi Party then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934, and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the powers and offices of the Chancellery and Presidency. A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole Führer (leader) of Germany. All power was centralised in Hitler's hands, and his word became above all laws. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In the midst of the Great Depression, the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy. Extensive public works were undertaken, including the construction of Autobahns (high speed highways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.  Racism, especially antisemitism, was a central feature of the regime. The Germanic peoples (the Nordic race) were considered the purest of the Aryan race, and therefore the master race. Jews and others deemed undesirable were persecuted and murdered. Opposition to Hitler's rule was ruthlessly suppressed. Members of the liberal, socialist, and communist opposition were killed, imprisoned, or exiled. The Christian churches were also oppressed, with many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on racial biology, population policy, and fitness for military service. Career and educational opportunities for women were curtailed. Recreation and tourism were organised via the Strength Through Joy program, and the 1936 Summer Olympics showcased the Third Reich on the international stage. Propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels made effective use of film, mass rallies, and Hitler's hypnotising oratory to control public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others.  Nazi Germany made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if they were not met. It seized Austria and Czechoslovakia in 1938 and 1939. Hitler made a pact with Joseph Stalin and invaded Poland in September 1939, launching World War II in Europe. In alliance with Italy and smaller Axis powers, Germany conquered most of Europe by 1940 and threatened Great Britain. Reichskommissariats took brutal control of conquered areas, and a German administration was established in what was left of Poland. Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned and murdered in Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps. The implementation of the regime's racial policies culminated in the mass murder of Jews and other minorities in the Holocaust. Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the tide turned against the Third Reich, and it suffered major military defeats in 1943. Large-scale bombing of Germany escalated in 1944, and the Nazis retreated from Eastern and Southern Europe. Following the Allied invasion of France, Germany was conquered by the Soviets from the east and the other Allied powers from the west and surrendered within a year. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and additional war-related deaths in the closing months of the war. The victorious Allies initiated a policy of denazification and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.

libertarianmeme,2vjoza,mister_anonymity,16,Wed Feb 11 16:08:42 2015 UTC,"I know you would like a TL:DR, but it's really hard to give a TL:DR about what happened in Benghazi. There is a lot of context and back story that is important to understand regarding what happened and more specifically what didn't happen at what time and why. I'll try to be fair to both sides here.  The best TL:DR I can give you is this. Our embassy in Benghazi was very understaffed and under protected. They told the state department that several times, and the state department, being a bureaucracy they red taped it and said basically, quit whining. To be fair, I'm sure they get told that a lot, and are used to responding to such requests accordingly.  Then on 9-11-12 they were attacked, and several people died. There was a near by outpost that was officially controlled by the CIA. They received a call from the Embassy asking for help, and since they were pretty close, they could actually hear gun shots and see the flames, they got their stuff together and got ready to roll out, but they were told by their superiors to stand down. So they waited, I think the figure I was told was 45 min, or maybe 15 min, I can't remember off the top of my head and I'm not looking it up. Then after a while, they decided they had to do something, even if it was going cost them their jobs and went anyway. By the time they got there it was too late, and when they got back to their outpost, they were then attacked there also.  There are the two main places where people have objections to Hillary's actions and the Oval office. 1) The order to stand down came from the state department. Some say the order came from Hillary herself, we'll never know. There was also no deployment of additional personal to protect the second outpost even after a fire fight and deaths had been confirmed. 2) In the aftermath of the event, the White House press secretary, Hillary, and Obama all stated this was a protest over a video that got out of hand. Basically, many people feel like instead of condemning the act, they gave a lecture about not-antagonizing radicals with our free speech. Of course this wasn't a protest, it was a planned attack, because people don't bring RPGs to protests.  To be fair, at the same time in Egypt there was a more legitimate protest over the video that was mentioned, however the two events were very different and likely unrelated, they just both chose 9-11 as the date.  The interesting part, according to some sources, the embassy at Benghazi was being used as a pass through to arm certain factions that we support, which is why some people suggest that's why it was really attacked.  *Edit, dammit, while I was typing /u/vbullinger beat me to it."

libertarianmeme,2vjoza,Angus_Fraser,7,Thu Feb 12 03:52:16 2015 UTC,"Ok, without digging anything up, off the top of my head (read: details are sketchy. Please do your own research)...  Most ambassadors are like senators' sons or cronies, etc. and know very little about the country to which they are ambassadors. Like, can't speak the language, never been there, etc. But they once worked as a VP at a company with the Speaker of the House or something.  Ambassador Stevens seemed to be different. He seemed to take note of and care about his job. He had heard reports of a possible terrorist attack involving the embassy or something US soldiers were protecting, etc. and requested extra security.  He was insistent and asked for help many times. He knew something was going to happen.  My assumption is that he wasn't supposed to know anything. That it was just supposed to happen and that he would've been left alone.  They decided he had to go during the operation. What operation? Getting large amounts of weapons into the hands of US-sponsored terrorist groups.  Republicans care about this event because they can say that the Obama administration failed by ignoring his pleas for help. But they don't talk about how the attack was done to get those weapons and that they ended up in the hands of US-backed terrorists, which is the real story. They just say ""Obama sucks!"" and walk away.  The government is super happy that the argument boils down to ""Did Obama screw up?"" Of course, that was planned.  EDIT: Oh! They could have easily stopped the attack but didn't. Some soldiers (seriously like only two???) disobeyed orders and went to defend the embassy and/or weapons cache. They literally held up the entire terrorist group for hours. They bought all the time in the world and the whole attack/theft could've been stopped if the US didn't intentionally let it happen because they wanted it to happen all along."

libertarianmeme,2vcrb2,turlockmike,8,Tue Feb 10 04:37:00 2015 UTC,"From wikipedia   Fritz Machlup listed the typical views of Austrian economic thinking.[25] (1) Methodological Individualism: In the explanation of economic phenomena we have to go back to the actions (or inaction) of individuals; groups or ""collectives"" cannot act except through the actions of individual members. (2) Methodological Subjectivism: In the explanation of economic phenomena we have to go back to judgments and choices made by individuals on the basis of whatever knowledge they have or believe to have and whatever expectations they entertain regarding external developments and especially the consequences of their own intended actions. (3) Tastes and Preferences: Subjective valuations of goods and services determine the demand for them so that their prices are influenced by (actual and potential) consumers. (4) Opportunity Costs: The costs with which producers and other economic actors calculate reflect the alternative opportunities that must be foregone; as productive services are employed for one purpose, all alternative uses have to be sacrificed. (5) Marginalism: In all economic designs, the values, costs, revenues, productivity, etc., are determined by the significance of the last unit added to or subtracted from the total. (6) Time Structure of Production and Consumption: Decisions to save reflect ""time preferences"" regarding consumption in the immediate, distant, or indefinite future, and investments are made in view of larger outputs expected to be obtained if more time-taking production processes are undertaken. Two important tenets held by the Misesian branch of Austrian economics may also be added to the list: (7) Consumer Sovereignty: The influence consumers have on the effective demand for goods and services and, through the prices which result in free competitive markets, on the production plans of producers and investors, is not merely a hard fact but also an important objective, attainable only by complete avoidance of governmental interference with the markets and of restrictions on the freedom of sellers and buyers to follow their own judgment regarding quantities, qualities, and prices of products and services. (8) Political Individualism: Only when individuals are given full economic freedom will it be possible to secure political and moral freedom. Restrictions on economic freedom lead, sooner or later, to an extension of the coercive activities of the state into the political domain, undermining and eventually destroying the essential individual liberties which the capitalistic societies were able to attain in the nineteenth century."

""economic output is strongly influenced by aggregate demand""  Basically trying to assume that aggregate supply can remain fixed during a modeling experiment in the long term.

libertarianmeme,2vcrb2,Slowhand09,4,Tue Feb 10 04:33:48 2015 UTC,"Austrian Economic Theory is basically Free Market Capitalism.  If you take an economics course, it will be all the stuff that makes sense because most of the basics are just common sense.  When you get confused and it stops making sense you've entered into the Magical Jellybean Kingdom of Keynesian fantasy.  I would encourage you to visit mises.org as Mysterymountain suggested.  Just poke around a bit to get the gist of it.  Although not exactly Austrian Economics, I always liked Friedrich Hayek's ""Road to Serfdom"" because it presents the dichotomy between the central planners and the free market - which is essentially the struggle between von Mises and Keynes."
libertarianmeme,2vcrb2,Anenome5,2,Tue Feb 10 04:12:29 2015 UTC,"When you get confused and it stops making sense you've entered into the Magical Jellybean Kingdom of Keynesian fantasy.   The keynesians even wrote a book called ""The Curse of Knowledge"" where they claimed that the smarter you were about economics, the harder it is to explain it to the plebeians. They try to claim that this is true of any profession, but really it is just a cover for their own failing to understand the doctrine of keynesian economics."

It was written, poorly, by a random dude.  The concept itself is considered a cognitive bias and is reasonable if undesirable. To become an expert in any field a large foundation of knowledge is required and a mastery of some subjects is required. Translating knowledge to non-experts without that whole foundation or mastery is a skill and some people just don't have it.  It has nothing to do with ""plebs"" and everything to do with the expert lacking a skill crucial to making their knowledge relevant outside of academic circles. Some just can't do it."

Walter Block, among others, defines himself as both, or as an Austro-libertarian. If you take that to its logical conclusion, you may end up a Rothbardian anarcho-capitalist.  Austrian Theory is a positive, as opposed to a normative, school of thought. It is positive in that it explains the world as it is rather than as people think it should be.   The method of analysis Austrians use is a rational individualism. Everything begins from the point of view of a rational individual because, as Mises stated, only the individual thinks...reasons...and acts.  Libertarianism is a normative way of thinking. What that means is that libertarians have a view of how the world should be. And the cornerstone of all libertarian though is the non-aggression principle.   Therefore, if you believe in the non-aggression principle, you should identify as a libertarian.   And if you also agree with the conclusions of Austrian school economists, then you are both a libertarian and an Austrian."

libertarianmeme,2vcrb2,viking_,4,Tue Feb 10 16:21:26 2015 UTC,"LOL  Here's a simple way to look at it.  If you cannot explain what economics is without advocating a plan to organize how society is to meet needs, then you're presenting a fraud that betrays the purpose of economics as the social science which it is.  Austrian Economics attempts to extricate the subject of economics itself from the sort of state worship that academia offers in justifying central planning schemes.  Certain people like the one I'm responding to here will try to guilt trip you into viewing people as classes of rich vs poor, which leads to equally absurd conclusions about how to treat the two groups. Trying to argue that a person is not capable of prospering and being unable to obtain economic mobility as they grow is going to fail for a lack of evidence, and even if there is a situation in which someone is not able to overcome a burden, one should be examining every possible source of such a problem, whether it's a lack of self esteem in the individual, or a systematic effect where policies or abuses inflicted onto a population precipitate outcomes of impoverishment.   The basics of economics are EASY to understand. Economics and finances are two different subjects.  Keep asking questions and don't settle for any one person's opinions."
libertarianmeme,2vcrb2,Psmgop,1 point,Tue Feb 10 17:25:48 2015 UTC,"So your theory is that economics has nothing to do with rich vs. poor.    I think your premise is that 'economics' = increasing the GDP while 'finance' relates to the personal wealth of individuals.     That's hokum.    How can economics exist without some values-judgements? Is its purpose of economics only to increase the GDP as fast as possible?    Is a country with 100 oligarchs and 100M poor, struggling people of equal value as one with the same GDP that has many millions of relatively well off people and thus fewer folks in dire poverty?     The decisions and levers-of-power that economists make to grow GDP are the same ones that effect income distribution, etc.    Your position would be like saying there's two different disciplines about how to work the economy, when there's only one set of levers.  You can't have two different sets of specialists working the same levers - they overlap, so obviously there's only one major here.  That's why they're taught together in the same major as microeconomics and macroeconomics."
libertarianmeme,2vcrb2,viking_,1 point,Wed Feb 11 02:08:42 2015 UTC,"I think your premise is that 'economics' = increasing the GDP while 'finance' relates to the personal wealth of individuals.   That's hokum.    GDP is a central planning metric that individuals do not use to determine the viability of their daily exchanges. I think you should spend more time reading and listening to what others are saying, because the comment you're responding to already indicates what I think about central planning and its affects.    How can economics exist without some values-judgements?   When did I say this wasn't true?   Is its purpose of economics only to increase the GDP as fast as possible?    Again, see above.   Is a country with 100 oligarchs and 100M poor, struggling people of equal value as one with the same GDP that has many millions of relatively well off people and thus fewer folks in dire poverty?    It's not a metric I would entertain to evaluate the subject of economics, or that of ethics as you seem to be intent on discussing. I think it's troublesome to imply you see beyond GDP and state provided statistics only to entertain these generalizations with someone who is already willing to talk about the underlying issues with you.   Your position would be like saying there's two different disciplines about how to work the economy, when there's only one set of levers. You can't have two different sets of specialists working the same levers - they overlap, so obviously there's only one major here.   There's really no contest here. Economics is a science, and as a science it should inform WITHOUT dictating. Good ideas should be self evident and not require force to implement as a means of creating prosperous outcomes. It would be like comparing it to the application of the physical sciences while disregarding what we know: It would be like expecting firewood not to burn when you light it on fire because you see utility in the outcome as the priority.  There are people who understand what economics is, and people who pretend that they have enough wisdom to technocratically plan an economy by force while ignoring the information problem associated with such a belief. If you truly believe in the concept of value, then you would recognize that perspective determines action, and a technocrat can rationalize, from their perspective, the value and purpose of their own job. In fact they're pretty much incentivized to justify it!   That's why they're taught together in the same major as microeconomics and macroeconomics.    It's convoluted and doesn't strike the root. Economics and finances are two different disciplines. It's not dissimilar to compare it to the relationship of Math to the practice of accounting. Accounting can be as simple as putting money in a piggy bank, or it can be a challenging practice of budgeting for a large business. The fundamentals behind it DO NOT CHANGE just because a government is doing it."

It's been briefly explained, and some outside references are provided, but there's been very little justification.   My critique is simple: It explicitly rejects any sort of empirical testing or falsifiability. You cannot draw an accurate map of the territory by sitting in your chair and thinking. You can play word games with some terms you defined, but the instant you attempt to apply your conclusions to the real world your model's applicability is up for empirical verification."
libertarianmeme,2vcrb2,viking_,1 point,Wed Feb 11 02:41:36 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between rejecting empirical science because one doesn't like the act of testing and retesting a hypothesis, and rejecting empirical testing because one doesn't believe that rational individuals are able to be scientifically quantifiable in ways that create bedrocks of knowledge for future empirical testing.  The Austrian schools believes the latter, not the former."
libertarianmeme,2vcrb2,viking_,1 point,Wed Feb 11 20:16:14 2015 UTC,"The Austrian schools believes the latter, not the former.   First, the failings of one epistemology do not constitute an argument in favor of another. This is a fallacy, typically classified as false dichotomy.  Second, you can believe whatever you want, but that doesn't mean it makes any sense whatsoever. There's a huge amount of empirical economic research about there, quantifying a great number of variables relevant to human behavior. Are you making this claim based off of a comprehensive review of the research, or just because radical skepticism sounds nice when you don't want to be contradicted?"
libertarianmeme,2vcrb2,the9trances,1 point,Wed Feb 11 23:33:58 2015 UTC,"I have never seen an Austrian make the claim that you call a false dichotomy. No Austrian says, 'because we can't empirically test individual human action, our methodology must be true!'   It's not like that. Austrians claim that their methodology is true regardless of what econometricians say.   In regards to your second statement, you are right. Belief and evidence are not the same. I never claimed that there is no quantifiable research of economics. I never expressed my personal opinion at all. I was clarifying the Austrian standpoint.  What I will say is that economists can test and predict whatever they want. I'll even admit that economists have proven that humans have tendencies that I would bet money on. For the most part, human behavior is predictable. But to say that economics is a science with conclusions that are absolutely certain is a joke. That's where I think Austrians do have a point, even though it may be insignificant in the world of mainstream economics.  I'll clarify the point again: When studying individual behavior, there is never 100% certainty of predictability. It is impossible."
libertarianmeme,2vcrb2,viking_,1 point,Thu Feb 12 00:26:07 2015 UTC,"I have never seen an Austrian make the claim that you call a false dichotomy. No Austrian says, 'because we can't empirically test individual human action, our methodology must be true!'   Well, the claim that empiricism is not valid in economics gets brought up a lot. If, as you say,    Austrians claim that their methodology is true regardless of what econometricians say.   then why does the validity of mainstream economics matter? The validity of one doesn't tell you about the validity of the other, at the very least until you have some conclusions--and that comes at the end of the process. Speaking of, here's a question: On what real-world economic issues do Austrians take a different descriptive conclusion than (let's say the vast majority of) mainstream economists? Whatever these differences are, we can look at reality and see which ones hold.    I'll even admit that economists have proven that humans have tendencies that I would bet money on.    Then economics has accomplished as much as any 'hard' science, up to some scaling factor.    What I will say is that economists can test and predict whatever they want. I'll even admit that economists have proven that humans have tendencies that I would bet money on. For the most part, human behavior is predictable. But to say that economics is a science with conclusions that are absolutely certain is a joke.    No science makes absolutely certain conclusions. Where did you get that idea from?   Hell, if you're being realistic, no field of study ever concludes anything with absolute certainty. Even in math, we make mistakes, and you should only be as certain of the conclusion as you are that whoever wrote the proof you read didn't make a mistake, that math is consistent, etc.   If you assign something a probability of 1, then by Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability given some evidence is still 1.    When studying individual behavior, there is never 100% certainty of predictability. It is impossible.   If you replace ""individual behavior"" with ""anything"" this statement is still true, which should tell you that it doesn't say much."
libertarianmeme,2vcrb2,viking_,1 point,Thu Feb 12 00:40:32 2015 UTC,"Now that we agree that, given a particular set of assumptions, we can't predict with absolute certainty, that's all you should take from this conversation. Its really the only point I'm trying to make.   By the way, I agree with you about science and math ultimately being areas that lack absolute certainty.   However, when Austrians make claims that many economists believe their work is no less valid that physical law, they are usually referring to the socialists who believe exactly that--for example: Marx's so called great law of motion of history.   I think that when Austrians take a radical anti-research stance, it is only because of a fundamental interpretation of the meaning of writers like Carl Menger.   A normal dude like me who greatly respects the contributions of Austrian thought will still ultimately be swayed by the scientific method as long as the results are undeniably and consistently able to be replicated."

It is simply a paradigm of how an individual looks at the world. Claiming that an individual is deliberately misinterpreting data when they are actually interpreting it correctly from their point of view is highly offensive to the scientists of the world. It is also why the scientific community takes a rigorous approach to science: we know that bias and error exist, and to minimize them, we repeat experiments constantly."

However, that likely isn't the case.  The Manhattan Project is also pretty unbiased work. It was work with radio activity and studied by the scientists to find what its effects were on people.

Edit: I guess a voluntary form of socialism/communism existed in the pre agriculture hunter gatherer days. In those times, your best chance of survival was to be a part of group. If you killed a deer, it was in your best interests to share it with the group, since a) you couldn't eat all the meat yourself before it spoiled, and b) if you shared it, the next time another member of the group made a kill, they would share it with you.  It seems unlikely anyone would be forced to be part of a tribe, but if you wanted to survive, being part of a tribe was your best bet.

Voluntary socialism exists outside of ancient humanity. There are communes all over the world where the basic tenants of socialism exist. Capitalism = claiming everything for yourself Socialism = sharing shit with other people    Both of these systems can exist in a voluntary nature and sitting around strawmanning the shit out of others beliefs does nothing but create in-fighting instead of allowing people to work together to tackle the problem of the state."

libertarianmeme,2u4uw0,statut0ry-ape,1 point,Fri Jan 30 17:51:32 2015 UTC,"You're right: voluntary socialism would work. However, this relies on the assumption the citizens of a society will all agree on a certain mindset and behavior. With this assumption, any form of government could exist, as long as the people agree with it.   I think it is human nature to reject norms, and always will be. I think that this decision among certain citizens of any (moderately sized to large) society is inevitable, and as a result some form of force to ensure the perpetuation of the current economic system is needed. In capitalism, these forces are provided by the market, and, in socialism, by the state. However, there are no such forces in libertarian socialism."
libertarianmeme,2u4uw0,arty0m_,1 point,Sun Feb 1 22:17:58 2015 UTC,"This relies on the assumption that the state will disappear and that anarchism will take hold on a large scale. I really don't see that happening, and personally I believe it to be a bit of an ad absurdum. I do see people working together in smaller communities in whichever socioeconomic system that is preferred by the majority.     And as long as they allow voluntary association to and from the communities, who cares what system is in place.    As ""libertarians""/anarchists/minarchists/whatever-ist, there is too much emphasis on arguing about what economic system is better than the current government and less problem solving about how to limit/stop the state. Topple the state and let everyone decide how they want to live. If they don't like the current system I'm sure there would be something different that is more tailored to their preference. Lolbertarians have a bad habit of prescribing everyone to their preference, which is no better than what the state is doing.     In capitalism, these forces are provided by the market, and, in socialism, by the state.     If we define the state as a collective of people who coerce others into supporting their system, then capitalists are doing the same when they enforce their system upon others. This also assumes that people can't choose to work together and share. Last time I checked there have been multiple LibSoc communities across the world throughout history that have worked peacefully together.    What I'm trying to say is that there is no one ""ism"" system for everyone. Voluntary interaction is key to creating a post-state society and the economic system is irrelevant as long as people have the freedom to associate with whatever community they choose."

The point of libertarian capitalism is that no one is forced into doing anything. Minimal taxes, regulation, and interventionism in general. No one is going to tell you what to do with your possessions, so if you think sharing is the way to go, do it."
libertarianmeme,2u4uw0,arty0m_,1 point,Mon Feb 2 01:07:45 2015 UTC,"How would any communities arise? If the state collapses people will have to return to a bartering system until some sort of mutual currency can be created. Instead of creating fiat, I believe the LibSoc communities would continue to simply work together for mutual benefit instead of competing for an accumulation of capital and ""private property"".     The point of libertarian capitalism is that no one is forced into doing anything     That is a bit much. People will be forced to do things, as you've said in the following sentence ""taxes, regulation"". These require force to exist.     No one is going to tell you what to do with your possessions     Taxation and regulation would tell me what to do with my possessions, to include whatever fiat the society uses."

libertarianmeme,2tysyd,jimbles1,15,Wed Jan 28 14:51:49 2015 UTC,I think the dmv system in Ohio is the way to go (assuming we keep the dmv). I'm not entirely intimate with the system but my understanding is that odot contracts out all it's services to private companies which get paid per item completion (ie $10 per vehicle registry). This means that dmv offices are about as common as post offices and means I never had to wait more than 5 minutes at the dmv even during peak hours. Moving from Ohio to lv was like a smack in the face.

But again, that is anecdotal evidence, which I suspect is not the hard evidence you are looking for. And you are correct, it is hypothetical, because I am unable to opt out.

In some cases privately owned plows are actually contracted to help the state/city plows so anyone who would claim we couldn't handle snow without government doesn't have a strong argument."

If you truly cared about the people living in the countries the immigrants are escaping than you wouldn't support opening the flood gates for immigrants to enter the US. My SO is from central america, her parents came here illegally and this is how we see it... The easier you make it for immigrants to come to the US or other countries than the less incentive you give the people with the actual means and influence to escape to actually stay behind and fix their country so the generations after them don't suffer.   To put it in simple terms imagine an immigrant coming to the US like a person in a long line that gets 100$ when they get to the front but when they receive the money everyone behind them is whipped. person by person keeps getting rewarded while keeping the line moving and hurting everyone behind them. All they have to do is stop the line and turn around and face their problems and no on gets whipped. The person in the front may not be rewarded but they can potentially save their people from suffering in the long run.   Americans revolted british rule and became america because they stood up and fought in the face of bad treatment, latin american countries can be corrupt and the very people that can rise up and fix it are the ones taking the easy way out and leaving.

Even still, it doesn't need to be a system, a free market is just people providing for themselves by trading what they've produced for good that others have produced, or trading for items that shared a common value (i.e: currency).Even more still people aren't the only part of nature.   I was referring to anarchism the ideology   Ah yes, the ideology of getting rid of government. An ideology shared by all groups under the Anarchist umbrella, from Ancap to Ancomm to Anarcho-primativism.   it makes sense for me to say historically anarcho-capitalism was capitalist because when Rothbard created it it was capitalistic   It's capitalistic by definition. When the word capitalism was invented holds no bearing on this. Like, we call pterodactyls pterodactyls even though the word wasn't invented when they were around. So, you've not made any point.  Also, capitalism is an economic system based on lack of government interference, making it the most anarchist economic system. This is especially true when stacked up against communism, which has always needed to be enforced by a government and coercion. Capitalism requires neither coercion or government."

So if you make something, whether it's cupcakes or a computer, you own it and the money you sell it for you also own.   If your cupcakes or computers are popular, you could gain more wealth.     Under communism, the community would own your labor and the products of it and would dictate how they would best be used for the good of everyone.

The biggest reasons many of these homeless people are not in houses is because it is not profitable to put them in those houses.   Those empty houses exist because our government fucked with the profit/loss system, leading house builders to incorrectly believe that building those houses would be profitable. The same fucking that caused the 2008 housing crash. This is what happens when you introduce central planning into the market; it is not a failure of capitalism. Your system would not be able to build the correct number of houses because it would require a central planner, and no central planner can take all information into account. It is not as simple as ""count the people, then build that many houses."" You have to control the entire supply chain of houses to do that, and it simply cannot be done through central planning.   Which anarcho-communist societies have self-devolved into state soviet dictatorships without outside intervention?    All of them. The USSR is Exhibit A.

As popular as Ron Paul was back then in r/politics, it was through the means of voting on reddit and not through the exclusion of topics or politicians that fit within the subreddit topic of politics. People debated about Ron Paul. r/politics these days is not open to debating when it excludes topics of discussion simply because it doesn't agree with them.  I do agree that subjects that once would have been debated in the old r/politics is now ""moderated"" to other smaller subreddits."

Because conservatives claim that the majority of health care cost increases comes from lawsuits (not true), so they say everything is a frivolous lawsuit and push tort reform.

There was never a point in time that people could just negotiate with hospitals directly and save money. You might be able to discharge medical debt in bankruptcy or if the account goes to collections, but you wouldn't be able to get a rate compared to what an insurance premium costs.

That might be true in some of the time, but even if it is it's a separate issue.    Nobody on either side of the aisle is pro-waste, so bringing that up might be useful if there is real waste to be eliminated, but otherwise it's a distraction.  You're really showing your anti-government bias.  Please try to put that aside for a while here.  Second, if the teaching profession requires a degree, and you won't pay taxes to support state schools to provide that degree, how do people get that degree from expensive colleges & universities if they don't already have the money to pay?.   You're setting up a catch-22.  Actually everything is a catch-22, but you're making it steeper and more difficult for no good reason.

libertarianmeme,2sy9ne,TakeOffYourMask,0,Tue Jan 20 14:00:46 2015 UTC,"First of all, Libertarians are in the minority and it's very much their(your) intent to be taken more seriously.  So it's not just my burden.  If you have evidence that would substantiate the Libertarian position, I'm very interested to hear it.  Second of all, it's really not about me at all.  I'm reasonably successful and well off.   It's about people's obligations to society and their responsibility to support the institutions that make it possible.   And I think you're putting words in my mouth that project your own bias.  Please stop that.  Libertarians hold all these institutions in general derision and don't want to contribute $$ their to them.  They define the whole thing as a boondoggle and an unfair/unreasonable burden.    They(you) believe things would work out fine if they were absent, despite (as far as I can tell) no solid evidence to back up that position.  My sense is that, though many of their complaints have some merit, many other ones are self-serving and are basically a mask for what is in essence greed and selfish, uncaring character traits and a grifter mentality where they're(you're) willing to take all the benefits yet unwilling to carry their weight.  Because - there' s an ideal world where things would be all-around better.  Well we don't live in that world, so I personally can't take that seriously.   And what about that example above: Kansas.

It's a reason for people to decide if they should go to college or not.  Personally, when I was asked about college, I wasn't going to go.  My plan was to get right into the work force.  By the time my friends got out of college, I'd have a promotion and be making slightly less than them, but without a gross amount of debt.

I explained why that argument is invalid because the trend worldwide is for taxes to be higher than libertarians want, thus without a distribution on both sides of libertarians' ideal tax rate (assuming for the sake of argument it exists) there do not currently exist circumstances that would allow libertarians to say ""country X's taxes are too low.""  Now you're arguing something different from your first argument, you're arguing about the effects of libertarians' tax policy preferences.  I get the feeling from reading your other posts that you have a surface-level grasp of what libertarian beliefs and arguments are. I suggest you start by studying economics if you want to debate libertarian policy positions (on economic matters anyway), otherwise you're just parroting left-leaning polemics."

Unfortunately, the company is growing strong. It's actually one of the largest employers in the geographic area. They don't want or need top talent - not all, but many of the supervisors and their bosses are some of the worst people you'd care to meet. This is by design.  They have a high rate of employee churn, but there's always fresh meat.  It's stock price dipped so much that it risked being de-listed once while I was there a number of years ago.

For anyone who is unfamiliar with the game, it takes place in a post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. in the future. The style of the game has like a 1950's retro feel to it. It tends to poke fun at Cold War era patriotism and propaganda.  The big robot character is called ""Liberty Prime"" and was built before(?) the apocalypse to beat back the Chinese Communists invading in Alaska.  Here are more quotes:  ""Communism is the very definition of failure!""  ""Liberty Prime is online. All systems nominal. Weapons hot. Mission: the destruction of any and all Chinese communists""  ""Obstruction detected, composition: titanium alloy supplemented by photonic resonance barrier.

I am all for lower taxes, but comparing the taxes we have today to the taxes in 1775 is irrelevant. You can compare us to other countries, but not other centuries. In 1775, the US was essentially a third world country, a colony of Great Britain. those taxes did not go to American roads, schools, fire and police, they went to pockets in London. this was also a time when people would donate over 20% of their income to the church, so factor that in to your calculations too. so 2.5% to London 20% to the church, oh and what about those roads and schools and stuff, yeah I bet there was a way of paying for those with either local taxes or side deals or whatever it cost an individual, or society, or the town, more money to put in a road in 1775 than it does today.

It would be correct to point out that before 1913 taxes were far lower than they are today and there still were roads, schools, the army, etc.  The problem today lies in the total level of taxation, not its form. In fact, an income tax is a far better method of taxation than tariffs (which used to be the primary source of revenue for the US federal government) since it distorts the economy less and doesn't lead to tensions with other governments (who may want to ""retaliate"" with import restrictions of their own, thus further hampering American trade)."

libertarianmeme,2rffq3,Crash_says,3,Mon Jan 5 23:54:49 2015 UTC,For much of early America we relied on high tariffs on imported goods. So basically we had a high consumption tax on imports to finance public expenditures...worth noting however that during the civil war the union and the south both basically printed money to pay for things but the northern currency retained value due to the union having a credible taxing power that maintained notional demand for the currency whereas the confederacy did not.   Its an interesting debate whether the loss in gains from trade due to the high tariff was or is better or worse than our current reliance on taxing income as opposed to consumption despite much freer trade.

The so-called ""whiskey tax"" was the first tax imposed on a domestic product by the newly formed federal government. It became law in 1791, and was intended to generate revenue to help reduce the national debt.  Although the tax applied to all distilled spirits, whiskey was by far the most popular distilled beverage in 18th-century America. Because of this, the excise became widely known as a ""whiskey tax."" The new excise was a part of treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton's program to fund war debt incurred during the Revolutionary War.

Also, the Supreme Court sometimes gets it wrong--that is why we have the opportunity to amend the Constitution, or are you forgetting the 11th Amendment?  The Amendment guaranteeing the individual states' sovereign immunity?  And also the 14th Amendment?  I think you are missing the fact that 42 of the states ratified the 16th Amendment, total.  The amendment was voted on by INDIVIDUALS in these 42 states, not the government.  Everyone back then accepted the practice of an income tax, and was willing to use an income tax, instead of tariffs, to generate income for the government.  It is only now that extremists are coming out of the woodwork and claiming that income taxes are unnecessary.  Sure, we don't need income taxes, if we don't want an army, education, roads, bridges, etc.  But we have to PAY FOR THE GOVERNMENT SOMEHOW.  Until you can offer me a better alternative, I fail to see how income taxes are so bad."

libertarianmeme,2qx8ff,Mr_Mujeriego,5,Wed Dec 31 23:01:36 2014 UTC,I agree to a certain extent but often Ron is often portrayed as the guy who ends up usually being right. Leslie even admits this.  There was an episode when Leslie tries to be a trash collector because she is told she can't do it and then ends up failing miserably.  I actually think the show has a good balance of taking shots at every group of people.

Edit: Approximately 278,544 Men and 201,773 women die annually  (1 in every 5 American deaths) due to cigarettes in the USA. 5 million deaths per year worldwide. The burden that tobacco puts on the healthcare system is insane.

So this things you like to ""Burn an Inhale"" end up being a burden on the entire country. If you want to smoke all power to you dude.

Get the government out of healthcare, and Garner's death might not have happened. But, do you really think cops arrest people just for selling loosies and that's the extent it goes? Cops arrest people for selling loosies because it was made against the law by politicians who see it as a threat to their tax revenue, threatening them with losing money covering healthcare for those who smoke. In the end, it's a tax problem and government overreach."

Fortunately though, for many that were dying without healthcare, you don't make policy. Garner died because he was selling  cigarettes ""illegally"" and some dumb fucking cops decided that it was enough to forcefully arrest him. The cops were the problem. The choke hold that the cops illegally used on Garner was a problem. The fact he was gasping and begging the cops for air, that's a problem. This is just an anti tax circle jerk.

Getting and burning things like coal is by far the cheapest way to get huge amounts of reliable energy. That's why rapidly developing economies like China and India are using them.  In places with sufficient economic development and wealth, the up-front cost of a nuclear reactor is not as much a barrier to adoption.

The 16th Amendment reads as follows:   The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.   That explicitly makes federal income tax legal.  Anybody who claims that federal income tax is illegal needs to demonstrate how the 16th Amendment doesn't say what it explicitly says in plain English, or must prove that the 16th Amendment is invalid.  Any other attack on the validity of federal income taxes is wholly irrational."

Let's take driver's licenses for example: http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/10/22/4935/   They'll say that driving is a privilege, but inability to drive is a de facto disability unless you live in one of the few cities with good public transit.  When society is structured around the assumption that you have something, it's difficult to then turn around and say ""but it's a privilege!""  In other words, forcing people to depend on a privilege that can be taken away at any time is a particularly insidious form of control."
libertarianmeme,2pod6i,broenadams,1 point,Tue Dec 30 13:32:21 2014 UTC,"While this is true for most occupational licensing, something similar to some licenses would likely exist absent the current incarnation of the regulatory state.

libertarianmeme,2pod6i,emanresu_sdrawkcab,5,Thu Dec 18 14:22:53 2014 UTC,a completely private road would definitely require some form of licensing to drive.   What makes you so certain?
libertarianmeme,2pod6i,UnmakerOmega,3,Thu Dec 18 15:47:44 2014 UTC,"The reason why private roads would have licensing would be mainly to ensure competency as a driver for liability purposes and possibly as a revenue generator. If the road owner can theoretically be held liable for conduct on their roads, they are only going to want good drivers on their roads. If a road owner doesn't enforce some sort of standard, they will lose customers based on perceived lack of safety. They will want a way to revoke the driving privilege in the event that someone is a bad driver and causes trouble, or doesn't follow the rules of the road in general (what those would be are not really germane here). So a licensing regime of some sort will likely emerge in a private road scenario."

They will want a way to revoke the driving privilege in the event that someone is a bad driver and causes trouble, or doesn't follow the rules of the road in general   They already have a way.

Like the other poster said, if the property owner doesn't take reasonable actions to prevent injury or damage, then yes they can be held liable.   So, if a road owner allows a habitual drunk driver on their road who causes an accident and kills someone, then the road owner can be liable.  Or, more broadly speaking, if the road owner just lets anyone drive without ensuring they are good enough drivers through some sort of licensure or certification, and that driver causes an accident, the road owner can be found negligent.    Depends on their target market. No doubt some people will prefer lower prices over perceived safety.   Some people might, but that's like saying someone would prefer paying 1/10 the airfare for a plane with 10 times the likelihood of crashing and killing them. I really don't think too many people are that willing to expose themselves to known risks.   They already have a way. It's called ownership. They can prohibit anyone they want from driving on their road.   Okay, but that doesn't solve the reasonable action problem as demonstrated above."

So a couple things there:   I'd have a really hard time guessing what the demand curve for increased safety is, but if the perceived risk of something is huge (like flying in a metal tube at 30000 feet) then there would probably be some premium on safety features until they became standard. Even if people wanted to buy low priced flights with less safety, that wouldn't make an airline not responsible for any crash. Again, if they aren't doing regular maintenance or cutting corners elsewhere, an investigation would find out and they'd get hemmed up in civil court for not taking reasonable precautions to prevent injury or death."

In the case of pot, you get shitty weed from mexico at high prices because cartels can operate in a vacuum, and there's no recourse for other entrants with better or cheaper product b/c there is no framework established by a governing body ensuring fair play.

Socialism vs capitalism are different ownership models for the means of production. Socialist ownership is based on state (Marxist socialism) or common (anarchist socialism) ownership. Capitalism is based on absentee ownership (private, not just personal, property). The exchange mechanisms using these ownership models can vary. There can be market market socialism, gift economy socialism, syndicalist socialism, labor token socialism, planned economy socialism, market capitalism, syndicalist-planned capitalism (corporatism), etc. Socialists say that the state is required for capitalism because otherwise the workers would take over the companies for themselves with elected leaders rather than bosses. After such internal reorganization, the exchanges between coops could still be market based.   TL;DR: The socialist argument has nothing to do with markets. It's about ownership."

It embodies the concepts of information source, message, transmitter, signal, channel, noise, receiver, information destination, probability of error, encoding, decoding, information rate, channel capacity, etc.  In 1948 Claude Elwood Shannon published A Mathematical Theory of Communication article in two parts in the July and October numbers of the Bell System Technical Journal.  In this fundamental work he used tools in probability theory, developed by Norbert Wiener, which were in their nascent stages of being applied to communication theory at that time. Shannon developed information entropy as a measure for the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing what became known as the dominant form of ""information theory.""  The book co-authored with Warren Weaver, The Mathematical Theory of Communication, reprints Shannon's 1948 article and Weaver's popularization of it, which is accessible to the non-specialist.

They must operate with a detached moral framework devoid of the emotion of the situation. Torture can never be justified in this framework. As a nation we can never have torture in our toolbox.

Because you can't get a job in your degree? Proof you got the wrong degree, idiot. How many people got a real degree and then a real job immediately and then their employer paid for their graduate school? Bet 5% of people take that route! If they don't pony up? Get a job, pay for night school out of pocket and then go get a different job after that.  And what's wrong with living with your parents?!? They can keep you on their insurance until AGE TWENTY-SIX (just typing that makes me so mad) but you can't live with them past your 18th birthday?!? I lived with my parents until I bought a condo at age 23, but... I would've lived with them longer if like, one girl didn't make a big stink out of it while dating.

The two officers were walking among the crowd of about 50 to gather information when some of the protesters recognized them as cops, Avery Browne, chief of the highway patrol Golden Gate division, told reporters Thursday evening. The officers attempted to leave, but a man struck one officer in the back of the head, starting a struggle, Browne said.  The crowd ""encircled the officers and began to close in,"" according to Browne. The officer who had not been hit brandished his badge and baton, and ordered the demonstrators to back up. He drew his sidearm because the protesters continued approaching them. At some point, a woman bolted from the crowd and kicked his partner in the head as he tussled with the man who'd punched him.

libertarianmeme,2or988,UnmakerOmega,6,Tue Dec 9 16:26:56 2014 UTC,"Subjective definitions are key. Farming communities had much less dense populations and social programs were implemented primarily within cities (due to fairly obvious constraints).  If I need to go into detail on the obvious moral hazard here and how a heavily taxed, non social benefit receiving group of farmers could feel as though they were not being represented, I can; but hopefully I don't need to.  Why would it be a good idea to let any one group of people hold the monopoly of power and therefore definitions? It's not like the colonies had 0 influence whatsoever over what happened; they just didn't have very much and weren't happy with their breadcrumbs."
libertarianmeme,2or988,Hebetude,0,Tue Dec 9 22:32:30 2014 UTC,"There's still a difference between under representation and no representation at all.

libertarianmeme,2or988,polishpimping,2,Wed Dec 10 01:10:14 2014 UTC,"It is clearly in the city's best interest to vote for taxes to be levied against areas of commerce not normally conducted in the city and to vote for social programs to be primarily implemented in such areas.  Given their greater density, politicians have a much easier time pandering to these populations and promising such policies. The moral hazard is that the politicians and city dwellers do not bear the cost of such policies; if you disagree with this assessment, please let me know where.  Given their chronic population density issues and the fact that social programs to such areas would be terribly inefficient, there were no reasonable course of actions for them to take to prevent further government encroachment and continued lack of return on investment(partial return of stolen goods). Just because they got a vote doesn't mean they had a chance at being represented. Again, it's all about perspective and subjective definitions as to whether or not either the farmers in the whiskey rebellion or the American colonist's had 'representation.'"

A moral hazard may occur where the actions of one party may change to the detriment of another after a financial transaction has taken place.   The farmers take the burden, the city dwellers get the benefits. Risk doesn't necessarily refer to physical harm especially with the ""in economics"" starting off the definition.  Economist Paul Krugman described moral hazard as ""any situation in which one person makes the decision about how much risk to take, while someone else bears the cost if things go badly.""  So while your flood zone example is valid, that doesn't magically make mine invalid. We're talking about the same thing, just different contexts.  Edit: As a note and what I've been trying to slip into this conversation is the obvious fact that democracy itself is a moral hazard as well as any other form of government by definition. Democracy is the 51% making a decision and then forcing the 49% to subsidize such a decision. Krugman up there and many others simply refuse to think things out to their ultimate conclusion."
libertarianmeme,2or988,Hebetude,3,Wed Dec 10 12:37:33 2014 UTC,"There is no more arguing with you. You paste the definition that says it's about risk, then you define risk as something else entirely. Income redistribution != moral hazard unless it is specifically subsidizing a risky behavior.  I can't handle this anymore, I'll be late for work... or as you would call ""I'll be moral hazard to work""."

libertarianmeme,2or988,ilikemesomefreedom,2,Tue Dec 9 16:27:51 2014 UTC,"First the taxes were implemented by parliament which the colonies had no representation in the voting body, unlike in the case of the whiskey rebellion, I don't agree with the tax but the situation is not Washington being a hypocrite. It is a consumption tax that is only paid when you voluntarily sell whiskey, granted it is unfair that it hurt small farmers in the west the most, but shit don't get mad at a guy for trying his best keep order by enforcing a tax that is helping to pay off the war debt of the revolution.

I was just pointing out the similarities of the situation to try and get you to think differently about the idea of governance.  Britain was an alien entity claiming the power to decide what happened to the colonists while having no direct ties to the consequences of such decisions.   The farmers in the west got very little benefits from any government programs and an alien entity (the majority[edit: or a very minuscule, minority special interest group who convinced the majority to grant them many monopoly privileges, depending on one's perspective], this time) claimed the power to decide what happened to the farmers while having no direct ties to the consequences of such decisions.  Why is it that simply changing the form of this entity suddenly makes it okay to steal from, murder, kidnap, etc. those who disagree with the entity's decisions?    I ask you this, what is you solution?   I'm an egoist with an affinity for anarcho-capitalism, though I often use panarchism instead since it's the ultimate conclusion of anarcho-capitalism. I don't have any specific solutions; these will come in the form of technologies, innovations, and changes in the way we interact so I guess invent, innovate, and learn to communicate would be solutions I advocate for.

The tax was proposed by Hamilton and was repealed under Jefferson's administration because it unfairly affected a group of people, I never agreed with the tax but unless we are to relegate ourselves to a hunter gatherer lifestyle, at that time and currently, government does serve a useful purpose as long as it serves out of reaction as opposed to aggression."

The tax was proposed by Hamilton and was repealed under Jefferson's administration because it unfairly affected a group of people   So why would the farmers need to wait forever for Jefferson to finally parrot a fact they've known all along before they can stop being stolen from?"

Government only has a monopoly on force when there is not sufficient enough people using force themselves, in the revolution, the King of England did not have a monopoly on force as his force was met by another force of the colonists. Attacking tax collectors is a crime because murder/assault is a crime, once their attacks got too out of hand for local law enforcement, the federal government had to step in.

So my philosophy of governance is to bring as much power back locally, where you have the most say in the matter and have the most trust in the authorities, as I feel you and I can agree, a policeman you know is better than one you don't know.  No, of course not, when its all said and done, we reacted irrationally and  illegally to the taxes England submitted on us, but history is written by the victors. Also, there is a difference in one section of a country uprising as opposed to a nationwide uprising, it doesn't make one more just than the other, just more legitimate. I am not demonizing the whiskey rebellion, they acted immorally to an immoral tax, that being said what should our government do if we legislate a constitutional tax and people are attacking the collectors, its the job the states and to that extent we as the people have delegated to the federal government to resolve.

All these things are anarchy in action and are creating anarchists everyday without them even being aware.  We do seem to be fairly well on the same page, but you seem to have accepted defeat and intend to only try and get as much out of choices handed to you. I'm certainly a pragmatist as well and don't think fighting the state's at all productive; they didn't get their monopoly on violence by not being the best at it.

That a side effect of this movement might have been generating more tax dollars while lowering wages.   But someone in economics can explain that part better. The lower wage jobs make sense, 100 jobs available, 100 men for those job, then add in 100 women. I get the supply of workers drove down the pay demand, but I don't understand the increase in taxes. It is still 100 jobs right? Now those 100 jobs are paying less, therefore paying less taxes too.  Now once those jobs increase to 200, now you have 200 workers where before you only had 100 workers, so you can have 200 workers paying into the system, but if there are 200 jobs and 200 workers, the pay wouldn't decrease.  Please someone who knows economics ELI5 to me."
libertarianmeme,2opgk7,molonlabe88,2,Tue Dec 9 05:33:02 2014 UTC,"It increases tax revenue in the sense that there are more workers than there were, and that's about it. If you have 100 jobs and 100 people, naturally you're not going to have increased tax revenue, but overtime the market adjusts to the fact that there are 200 people, and creates more jobs. Those jobs are taxed, and more tax revenue is created.  The more interesting observation is how this has changed everything else. ""Wages are stagnant since the 1970s"" is a claim you may hear often, and it has some truth for it. For men wages have been stagnant, but for women wages have been climbing steadily since the 1970s to the point where we're at now. Women my age earn >93 cents on the dollar to men with similar education in similar positions with similar experience. That near parity did take those four decades to reach, but that has a very interesting implication. Wages haven't stagnated, they've doubled.   The market is set up assuming a family unit. Like it or not this is what everyone assumes people ultimately gravitate to. It's what the price of new homes and new cars especially are built upon. In the 1970s we had men's income and very little from women. Since the 1970s men's income has kept pace with inflation but not grown, while women's have grown to meet men's. That family unit has now fully twice the income it had in 1970. Which is part of why we've been able to devalue the dollar so much without suffering too much for it.   It's also why production doubled but wages have remained stagnant. If you assume a family unit - production has doubled as there are now two people working where before there was only one. Income has doubled along with it, because there is now income parity. It's the misleading assumption in that chart so often displayed, the production they show is not per capita production, it's total economic production, which obviously will double if the number of workers doubles (and they all get jobs)."

I do continue to engage the system, more or less for the reasons you laid out. I don't necessarily expect that to work, and personally I feel like there's more to be gained in other areas than politics, but you're right that supporting people when they do the right thing, and electing people who are more likely to do the right thing, is a good policy.  The reason why I don't really feel like politics gets us far, as libertarians, has more to do with collectivism. When we hold elections, our voices get shouted down by the people who vote republocrat. Similarly, if I want to support Rand Paul for doing the right thing, I also have to support him for all the times he did the wrong thing. It's all wrapped up into one vote."

It's possible the quote was about something else, but the common quote I always hear compares the tea tax which (in part) speed the revolution, and tax rates today. That argument is fallacious.

libertarianmeme,2obm18,polishpimping,1 point,Fri Dec 5 15:57:23 2014 UTC,"Good point. I agree that a large part of the historical picture was about representation, though I'm not sure the extent. Aside from that, what about regulatory agencies? Would you say that they answer to congress/the president so they are still part of a representative government? I would say that they represent congress unduly giving away their power to make law to the executive branch. Still, I suppose everyone overseeing the process is elected. I guess I have a problem with the attitude that just because they were elected it means their actions aren't tyrannical or comparable to the actions of kings.  edit: sorry if this reads too much like thinking out loud."

I'm just saying the purpose of comparing things to George III specifically is generally to make the comparison to the revolution. The revolt was about representation primarily, and we definitely have better representation now, but as you point out it isn't absolute or ideal.

The fact that people were taxed without representation was a great rallying point and a great slogan, but people tend to forget:   King George lived a far way away and was very slow and unresponsive to American concerns.  King George and Parliament curtailed and overruled colonial legislatures whenever he wanted. King George and Parliament raised taxed abnormally to pay for the war with France.  King George and Parliament prohibited the colonists from settling west of the Appalachian Mountains. They banned banned American assemblies from issuing paper bills or bills of credit. This made them completely beholden to Britain's monetary system.  They required colonists to house and feed British military members in their own homes. After the Tea party, they punished everybody in the colonies by outlawing town meetings and the closing of Boston Harbor. He ordered British troops to seize stores of colonial gunpowder and to capture Samuel Adams and John Hancock.   He did quite a lot that made him a tyrant besides just ""tax"" them."

libertarianmeme,2o3ife,farkusfarko,1 point,Wed Dec 3 21:47:33 2014 UTC,"Mainly to hurt their competitors, and thereby help themselves.  Consider the small, but illustrative example of interior decorators. There was a video on reason.com a while back about this, and if anyone has the time to link it or google it, it's worth a watch.  Basically, until a few years ago (the example deals with Florida), anyone could be an interior decorator (amazing, I know)--from the largest, established businesses that offered this sort of service, to individuals who thought they had a flare for it and wanted to try doing it for money.  Naturally, the established firms wanted to protect their market share against competitors. The easiest way to do this isn't to be the best at what you do and charge fair prices, but rather to create barriers for their competitors (often just individuals, remember) to enter into the market at all.  This was accomplished by a lobbying campaign in the name of ""consumer protection"" to establish a liscensure regime in Florida for interior decorating. This means if you want to charge money to arrange someone's furniture and decorate their home, you have to be certified and pay a fee to the state of Florida.  This was publicly done to ""protect the consumer;"" from what, I have no idea--bad taste?   The real reason is that it makes it harder for new businesses to start-up and compete with the already existing firms in the field.  Note, that outside of the campaign/lobbying from the established interior decorating firms, there was (shocker) NO public pressure for the state to step in and regulate the industry.  This lengthy example is just a microcosm of what happens in every industry every day at the federal level. I'd venture that MOST regulations on the books were put there at the behest of corporate interests, not in spite of them.  Edit: Found an article on it here.  Relevant quote:    Under a state law passed in 1994, anyone who wants to practice commercial interior design in Florida must be licensed. That means completing a combined six years of schooling and apprenticeship and passing a two-day exam."

The bill has numerous loopholes giving special exemption or subsidization to businesses below 50 employees.  Or consider environmental regulations.  Terrible, perhaps, for the start up mining firm that's facing a high cost of market entry.  But decidedly better for the local farmer who benefits from underutilized and unpolluted ground water.  If a regulation functions as a Pigouvian Tax or limits caustic negative externalities, the businesses shoved off the edge will be those that are cost-negative for the community at-large.  This will be a net-positive for everyone, including other small businesses looking to compete at higher price points by employing community-conscious business policy."

Forcing those guardians to pay into a system that squanders money, indoctrinates its pupils and forces compliance to arbitrary rules is not altruism.  The state, at its core, is inherently violent, and requires the use of violence to ensure compliance with its monopoly on services.  The collection of money (again, by force, regardless of your opinion on how taxes are collected - if you refuse and continue to refuse to pay, they will violently get ""what's theirs"") to pay for these services is an extension of the violent monopoly the state must employ to enforce compliance.  Your critical misunderstanding is equating society, or civilization, with the nature of government.  We are all born indebted to no one because it is impossible to be indebted to someone without first requesting something from them.  The supposed altruistic nature of the state is nothing more than self preservation:  indoctrinate the young to support and love the state, that way they become incapable of questioning the nature by which the state operates."

libertarianmeme,2nw9km,bryanvickersband,0,Mon Dec 1 02:57:33 2014 UTC,"Your swath of ideology is ungrateful and selfish. You take for granted everything that has been done to enable your life. The government is a necessary evil and a means to an end. It's officers have the right to protect their lives just as you or I do. That doesn't mean that it is inherently violent.    Indeed it does. Now specifically speaking to those living in the United States, their situation is one of a relative free people, which affords them the ability to have such discussions without repurcussions. Compared historically, there is less economic freedom of choice and significant erosions into the private lives of citizens (frequently violent intrusions no less) than in years past. There is less immediate recourse for wronged citizens, and quickly evaporating systems for legal recourse using governmental mechanisms. The whole NSA spying scandal is evidence: nothing has changed in the 2 years since Snowden revealed the lengths government goes to ensure compliance.    When a citizen breaks the causal chain between the government's interest in enforcing its laws and the actual peaceful enforcement of those laws, it is the citizen who is creating a situation wherein violence is required. Respect for both civilization and the government would eliminate the need for violence.    I'm certain this very argument would have been used in 1940s Warsaw or the Ukrainian SSR in 1932. Violence is only ever required to enforce compliance when it is not possible to out compete other market pressure (market in a context of sum human desire rather than consumer or other monetary markets).   You seem to think that the government is some evil and independent entity that has us in a stranglehold. It is not. The government is the end result of humanity's gradual recognition of the need for centralized authority. It is corruptible just as anything else, but it is a necessary evil and certainly the best system we've worked out.    So government is corruptible, yet required. The result of the corruption is, in your own words, evil, yet the impetus of human desire is to have a centralized, corruptible central authority? This is quite literally what Maoist China was, and they killed 45 million people to enforce compliance.   Instead of complaining about the evil government like an ungrateful child, why don't you suggest our other options? Come up with a better plan, mobilize people, convince them of your reasoning, and change the world. I'd love to hear your better suggestions.    The plan we have is fairly simple: stop using violence and force to get people to pay for things. If the government can provide services better than the market (including environmental services) then their service should easily out compete any attempted private venture into the same market. Giving people the opportunity to opt out, though, would quickly mean they have no need for government services even when they are not provided. If people have no need or use for government services, and are not obligated to pay into the system, how can a government claim to have power over that person?"

If you refuse to comply for your own reasons, it is YOUR action that leads to the violence of the mugger shooting you.  Imposing some condition upon someone before you attack them does not shift the cause of the violence to the other person. If you attack someone, that violence is caused by you, regardless of whether you told them you'd do it beforehand or if they didn't jump through whatever hoop you said beforehand.  Come on, this is learned in kindergarten.

The actions taken by a bunch of people calling themselves a ""government"" aren't fundamentally different to the actions taken by a bunch of people calling themselves a ""mafia"", or a ""gang"", or any other word used to describe a group of people.

TLDR: More freedom ≠ Socialism   Read Rothbard's ""Left, Right, and the Prospects for Liberty.""  The classical liberty movement is historically properly considered left-radical, because the right were the conservatives, and by this term 'conservative' I mean defenders of the ancien regime, such as royalists.  At the time radical left individualists like Benjamin Tucker moved largely in alliance with radical left communalists, and both opposed the regime that sought to protect power and privilege for the ruling class.  As the classical liberal movement died off, all that was left was the left, and they split into socialist nationalists (fascists) and socialist internationalists (socialists).  Then the liberty movement was rediscovered in the US, its flame having been kept alive by a very few people, then popularized and the modern ""conservative"" movement was born, but this term bears little relation to its ancient meaning. In fact conservatives today think of themselves as anti-government radicals, when in fact originally the term meant the opposite. And today the left radicals are the ones in power and reconciled to the state, such that they are the new 'conservatives' in terms of historical meaning of the term.  So if you take a broad view of ideological history, right libertarians are actually left classic liberals, and anyone who defends the state is actually a right conservative, which means the leftist so-called radicals today."

Secondly, if you are a driver for said company and you get in an accident which requires someone to go to the hospital, they are taking blood and urine from the driver.  That would make the company liable.  Even if the driver only smokes on the weekends and it is Thursday.  The presence of THC-COOH does not mean you have THC in your system.  It just means that THC was in your system.  As a prosecutor, it would be easy to win a case against you even though the drug was not in your system, but the by product was.

libertarianmeme,2nha8w,megazen,5,Wed Nov 26 22:07:50 2014 UTC,"Spending Gap: Women Drive over 80% of Spending  When feminists talk about the wage gap, mention the Spending Gap! (wage gap is a debunked myth based on ""comparable worth"" paradigm).  While men make more money than women on average women control and spend vastly more money than men.  Pocketbook Power: How to Reach the Hearts and Minds of Today's Most Coveted Consumer - Women Bernice Kanner (2004)  (Men work longer hours at more dangerous and disagreeable jobs. They more readily accept night shifts, hardship, entrepreneurial risks).  According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, women-who comprise just over 51 percent of the U.S. population, making them the largest consumer segment in the country-control six trillion dollars in buying power annually. Statistics show that:   Women control (or influence) 88 percent of all purchases. Women handle 75 percent of family finances. 43 percent of those with assets over $500,000 are women. One out of every 11 women in America owns a business. Women influence two out of every three of the 3 trillion dollars spent in the U.S. each year!   Men pay the majority of social security taxes and are outlived by six years by women, but the government makes no fair adjustment to how those funds are distributed.  Women as an economically disadvantaged group is a myth that negatively affects men.  The Spending Gap has increased due to costly divorces where husbands lose half their assets (even if earned by themselves before marriage), forced by family courts to pay high alimony and child support or jailed. Fathers are frequently denied shared parenting by biased family courts.  ""Whether it's making money or spending money, the power of women has never been stronger. Women drive over 80 percent of the consumer economy in the United States - that's about $5 trillion dollars annually."" - Ekaterina Walter, The Power of Women, Huffington Post, 03/22/2013  Some stats are not fully verified, but it's safe to say that women drive the majority of consumer spending.  Do Women Really Control 80% of Household Spending?  “It is not possible to say how much spending women control because so much spending is done at the household rather than the individual level,” Cheryl Russell, editorial director for New Strategist Publications, wrote in an email. “My own personal estimate, based on my analysis of the Consumer Expenditure Survey, is that women are involved in 78 percent of consumer spending. This figure is based on the share of households headed by married couples, female-headed single parent families, and women who live alone multiplied by the average spending levels of each of those household types. By the same measure, men are involved in 76 percent. There is not much difference because married couples account for the bulk of spending, and both men and women are involved in those spending decisions.”  The numbers typically originate with companies and writers who specialize in emphasizing the importance of marketing to women — who do seem to control more than half of household spending, according to some surveys, but not 80%. This isn’t academic research, and a half dozen economists contacted said they aren’t familiar with any studies that quantify women-controlled spending. “The notion of spending under ‘control’ of one group just does not make much conceptual sense to me,” Harvard University economist Lawrence Katz wrote in an email.  Ira Mayer, publisher of the newsletter Marketing to Women, which in 2009 tried and failed to find the origin of the stat, isn’t convinced that women spend $4 for every $1 spent by men, as the 80% figure suggests, but he is confident that women do spend more. “Anecdotally, would it appear to just about anyone that women control more buying decisions than men? Yes,” he said. But Mr. Mayer isn’t even sure that having an exact number matters. “It would be nice to know, but I don’t know what it would tell us if we knew that actual number,” he says.  ""it does not seem to identify and separate how much of the spending is solely on them as opposed to what will also be spent on children and other family necessities.""  Who pays for the majority of child raising expenditures and other family necessities? Primarily fathers and men via taxes."

I've been on the low side of that and I mostly have myself to blame - school debt, poor location, poor skill acquisition choices.   No, not everyone has the opportunity. Not everyone is able to break free of the culture they were born into, or even realize that there are opportunities for them. And if they don't know that those opportunities exist, then essentially those opportunities do NOT exist.   Even if some of them DO realize that there are opportunities for them, those opportunities often mean losing their entire family and friends and community, and adopting a foreign one, which is frightening to most people. Sure, call it a character flaw to be frightened at losing everything you have, but I don't see it as a character flaw at all. I see it as natural.   The only time asset acquisition is evil is when it is forced, either by crony capitalism or direct government force/monopoly.    If you've ever worked a day in your life, you should know that every bit of capitalism is ""crony capitalism"". You can't get things done unless people like you. You don't hire people you don't like. You don't buy things from people you don't like or trust. It's ALL about who you know and whether or not they like you (whether you can count on them as a friend, essentially).    Almost nobody is 100% innocent, but if a billionaire built a product that enough people needed or wanted enough to pay for it, then it's perfectly moral. What he or she does with the money, in a social sense, is no business of mine.    And THAT attitude is how we get homeless people.   Opinions are fine, but petitioning the government to force people to act a certain way is truly evil.   WHY?!? If people won't be decent on their own, you MAKE them be decent. Would you also advocate for eradicating jails and prisons? How about oh, I don't know, getting rid of all traffic laws too? That'll ensure that everyone is free to find their own equilibrium speed, and nothing could possibly go wrong!

Umm...""crony"" specifically refers to companies with political ties and direct political support, not ""people who like you."" You may be thinking of ""nepoism,"" but that applies to relatives and friends.   Of course nobody wants to work with people they dislike. Unless those people get results, then it seems not to matter.   And THAT attitude is how we get homeless people.   Attitudes don't cause homelessness. Taxation, devaluing currency through inflation, oppressive building requirements, making it illegal to feed or assist the homeless without a license or printed nutrition facts, and reduction in mental health care opportunities all cause homelessness (the latter which could be at least partially solved through charity if people weren't burdened under the weight of massive income and consumption taxes).  To whit: there are homeless people in countries that have no billionaires. There are homeless people in cities where there are no millionaires.   WHY?!? If people won't be decent on their own, you MAKE them be decent. Would you also advocate for eradicating jails and prisons? How about oh, I don't know, getting rid of all traffic laws too? That'll ensure that everyone is free to find their own equilibrium speed, and nothing could possibly go wrong!   Actually...yes. But that's not at issue here. (Regarding the speed thing, your hyperbole has been shown to actually be the case. Many road engineers recommend higher speed limits for safety, but that reduces ticket revenue for police departments).  Forcing people to ""be good"" by being evil (force must be backed by physical violence) seems like a set of conflicting ideals. Fucking to promote abstinence, bombing for peace, etc.   Where do you think that money comes from?   Money comes from economic productivity and trade consensus - it existed long before any governments. Where did you think it came from? Certainly not from sheets of green paper, I hope."

libertarianmeme,2n448k,iopq,-1,Sun Nov 23 09:31:49 2014 UTC,Obama has written fewer executive orders per year than any president since Grover Cleveland.
libertarianmeme,2n448k,kirkisartist,5,Sat Nov 22 22:18:17 2014 UTC,"As if numbers mean anything. If some president writes a single executive order in his presidency, but the order is to murder a million people, I'd find that a far worse abuse of power than anything Grover Cleveland has done.  The point is the expansion of claimed and exercised power by executive order, which has continued unabated and without any means for abatement, since the presidency began.  Also you may notice that I don't speak about Obama specifically, even if the image is directed towards this latest presidency incarnation."
libertarianmeme,2n448k,kirkisartist,1 point,Sat Nov 22 22:21:27 2014 UTC,I agree. I have a beef with some of his executive orders. This isn't about those. It's about his recent immigration reform. Which does not classify him as a usurper.

But your remaining commentary leads me to see any discussion about this to be a futile endeavor. However, that does make them trespassers.   What's wrong with going Galt?   You assume I think Ayn Rand has some form of legitimacy in a non fantasy setting. There's no such thing as going Galt. There is such a thing as not forcing yourself amongst people who don't want you. You come in my house, without permission, I'll remove you, up to and including a hole in the ground if necessary. When these people benefit from a gang of thugs stealing from me in order to buy votes to further entrench the oligarchy, I have every right to tell them to keep themselves, their criminal acts, and their highly contagious diseases as far away from my backyard as I wish.   When these people aren't getting free services funded through money stolen from me and millions of others, then they can say how they're hard workers, and wish to benefit society. However, they don't. They're leeches, and there are enough of those here already.  Also, I have worked with these people. They're not hard workers. They're mediocre workers that blackmail others.   I'm sick of you paleofascists and your desire to make people illegal.   I'm rather sick of your false altruism, bleeding heart, and willingness to put me and my family in harms way in order to satisfy you're utopian vision. I'm also sick of you're inability to understand the words you use. So allow me to further offend your sensibilities.  There are laws. If these people are unwilling to follow the most basic, then why should I expect them to refrain from violating the most egregious? Their entire relationship with this society began with a violation of law. They're criminals, and deserve to be removed for that act (which is what the law says, fyi). Notice the inherent lack of trustworthiness for their actions.    These are people I grew up with, so excuse me if I don't want to see your kind round them up.    Feel free to go with them and ""Go Galt"" in Mexico. You're emotional attachment obviously clouds your ability to understand the most basic arguments for removing these people, and why they should not be allowed to come here all willy nilly like you'd like.   Whatever happened to ""if you don't like it leave""?   You have us confused with conservatives. I'm not the one who sucks, its the ones who are forcing themselves upon us who do. They're the ones who need to go.  Just be happy that we don't just drop them in the middle of the Atlantic as a permanent, and much cheaper, solution. If that were the case, you could also join them as well.  Getting back to the heart of this matter, after hopefully putting you in a foul and irate mood. Citizenship requires law in order to be defined. there are requirements to being a citizen, and it's not just ""hey, I illegally violated you're communal property, let me join your club so I can mooch"".   In the modern world, law is administered by organizations called states. States govern over geographic areas, and do as they wish within those boundaries, including deciding who gets to be members of their club, and who don't. We live in a democratic republic, which means the people have a say, and those people say gtfo (on the mild side). So respect their wishes, stop promoting the presidents idea of executive authority which is fundamentally unconstitutional (ya know, illegal), and get over your severe butthurt.   Instead of approaching a topic like a two year old throwing a tantrum, approach it with an actual argument to sway my position. All you've done is further entrenched my belief that fools like you lack a brain and act on that imaginary thing called emotions in order to have a copout for what you actually think. Your emotions don't sway me in the slightest, nor do your sob stories of sympathy for anothers plight."

Perhaps republicans would concede to some form of amnesty if it were coupled with other reforms of immigration and borders such that we don't find ourselves  again with millions of people here illegally in the future.

""Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!""   The entire poem is a big ""take that"" to the rest of the world. “Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” We do not want to follow your old ways, your despotism, your tyranny. We are something new and something grand.   So give us ""...your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost..."". Give them to us and watch was we can do.  We built a nation on a few basic principles and made it great but now we are moving further and further away from those principles. In a free and open society, immigration is a boon. Only a draconian, welfare state fears immigration because it is a threat to the system. When did we stop believing in ourselves?    Additionally, Daniel Griswold wrote the following article - Immigration Law Should Reflect Our Dynamic Labor Market  Here are a few key excerpts;   Low-skilled immigrants cross the Mexican border illegally or overstay their visas for a simple reason: There are jobs waiting here for them to fill... Each year our economy creates hundreds of thousands of net new jobs...that require only short-term, on-the-job training.  At the same time, the supply of Americans who have traditionally filled many of those jobs — those without a high school diploma — continues to shrink. Their numbers have declined by 4.6 million in the past decade...  Yet our system offers no legal channel for anywhere near a sufficient number of peaceful, hardworking immigrants to legally enter the United States even temporarily to fill this growing gap. The predictable result is illegal immigration.      Crossing an international border to support your family and pursue dreams of a better life is not an inherently criminal act like rape or robbery. If it were, then most of us descend from criminals...  When large numbers of otherwise decent people routinely violate a law, the law itself is probably the problem. To argue that illegal immigration is bad merely because it is illegal avoids the threshold question of whether we should prohibit this kind of immigration in the first place.      In the 19th century, America's frontier was settled largely by illegal squatters. In his influential book on property rights, The Mystery of Capital, economist Hernando de Soto describes how these so-called extralegals began to farm, mine and otherwise improve land to which they did not have strict legal title. After failed attempts by the authorities to destroy their cabins and evict them, federal and state officials finally recognized reality, changed the laws, declared amnesty and issued legal documents conferring title to the land the settlers had improved.  As Mr. de Soto wisely concluded: ""The law must be compatible with how people actually arrange their lives."""

So, it is your contention that the peoples of North America before the arrival of Europeans were anarchists? I am unaware of them ever describing themselves as such. Sorry, you're position is only possible if you ignore anarchism itself, which is a pretty silly thing to do for someone who thinks they are an anarchist."
libertarianmeme,2mvp7a,phoenix_insurgent,1 point,Sun Nov 23 01:02:22 2014 UTC,"Nope, statelessness is an aspect of anarchism, but it isn't the whole deal.   Opposing the state is the defining characteristic of anarchy, as taken from the derivation of the word.    Etymology: The word anarchy comes from the ancient Greek ἀναρχία, anarchia, from ἀν an, ""not, without"" + ἀρχός arkhos, ""ruler"", meaning ""absence of a ruler"", ""without rulers"").    Anyone advocating a stateless society is an anarchist. You simply want to knock ancaps who aren't your brand of ideology on top of anarchy. You want to pretend that that which you are currently claiming is essential to anarchism isn't simply your own preference.  I have no problem saying that there are many flavors of anarchy, and many associated beliefs and systems, but I'm not foolish enough to claim those people aren't also anarchists.  Anarchy is defined by opposition to something, namely the state, and the word leaves absent what could replace that structure. Obviously anarcho-capitalists believe the market should replace the state.  Why not just drop your one-true-scotsman attack and realize that we're allies in opposing the state even if we accept different property norms. You're probably more correctly an anarcho-communalist, whereas I am an individualist-anarchist.    Anarchy refers to a society without a publicly enforced government... Pierre-Joseph Proudhon adopted the term in his 1840 treatise ""What Is Property?"" to refer to a new political philosophy, anarchism, which advocates stateless societies based on voluntary associations.    Exactly what ancaps advocate.    Anti-capitalism is also a part of it.   Sure, if you define capitalism as the confluence of state power with business power. If one defines it thus, ancaps are opposed to capitalism too, only we call it corporatism. Does your entire position here rest on ignorance of differing semantics? Obviously a state must exist for capitalism as you're defining it to exist, and ancaps oppose the existence of the state, so how do you imagine we could possibly be suggesting we're okay with your concept of capitalism.   So, it is your contention that the peoples of North America before the arrival of Europeans were anarchists? I am unaware of them ever describing themselves as such.    They had tribal governments of sorts, that's not anarchic nor voluntarist, no."
libertarianmeme,2mvp7a,Anenome5,1 point,Sun Nov 23 01:19:16 2014 UTC,"I'm actually referencing anarchism as a political theory, a set of ideas and a consistent movement that exists even until today, which alone excludes ancaps from being part of it. But no, we are definitely not allies. When I go on strike, you support the boss. When I get evicted by my landlord, you are on the side of the property owner. Anarchism has always been anti-capitalist. If ancaps are anti-capitalist then they should probably not have the word ""capitalist"" in their name. Maybe you should take that up with them. It's a little ridiculous, don't you think, if they're in fact against capitalism. It'd be like anarchists being called ""governmentists"". Pretty silly, don't you agree? No, ancaps have no place in anarchism, anarchists agree on this. Ancaps are the enemy just as the boss and the landlord is. I think you might want to do some more research on individualist anarchists, because they are all anti-capitalist. You seem to be seriously confused about this issue. Why is that? I mean, how is it that ancaps are so confused about capitalism and about the individualist tradition within anarchism? Pretty shocking, really. My theory is that it's because they aren't anarchists."

Carnegie reduced the price of steel from $160 a ton to $17 from the mid-1870s to the late 1890's.  Oil and steel go into the production of almost everything.

The system itself is a strong factor in determining outcomes. I once encountered a piece of wisdom regarding organizational reform: Your current structure is ideal for producing your current results. This applies to our government.   If you can't get the 50%+1, doesn't that mean you need to convince more folks, and not abandon the process? Your view seems self-defeating.   You're falling for the same fallacy I described. Maybe you could make some headway if you got buy-in from 50%+1, but in order to achieve those numbers you have to persuade people to depart from ideas virtually all of them consider non-negotiable first principles. Ever wonder why nobody in the federal government ever touches Social Security? Why no one since Kennedy has put up hardly a sliver of resistance to a belligerent, imperialistic foreign policy? To change our government into a libertarian one, it's not the voters you need to win over. In our system they're just the vehicle you use sometimes to get some political power. Voters only care that you tell them what they want to hear in the weeks before an election. Where you do need buy-in is from the other elected people, and from the permanent bureaucracy that is carrying out policy on a daily basis. Libertarian goals would put most of them out of a job, on top of changing policy in ways they would see as hideous, treasonous, and dangerous.   This isn't self-defeating. It is a fact. And knowing which routes are futile is the first step in finding the ones that aren't.   Are there any Libertarian areas or towns that exemplify the worldview and laws you would like to see enacted?

libertarianmeme,2m94jo,Goobiesnax,8,Fri Nov 14 04:06:45 2014 UTC,"It's actually because OPEC continued to produce into surplus, rather than ISIS entering the market at a lower price point. Before ISIS 'officially' started selling off their oil at below market price OPEC decided to keep production high rather than slow down to maintain equilibrium.   Now it's certainly possible that OPEC will continue high production in order to disincentivize ISIS oil, for example if you're buying oil from ISIS at $20 and oil from OPEC at $50, that difference probably isn't worth enough to piss off the entire developed world. If it's $20 and $120, we may have a different story.   Noting also that because ISIS is an actor in the middle east, where some of OPEC's top-producers are, they have even more incentive to decrease market price, because it limits ISIS funding if they can't sell their oil. By doing so they limits ISIS' actions, and may serve to stabilize the region. Or at least make it easier to do so."

libertarianmeme,2m94jo,Angus_Fraser,6,Fri Nov 14 19:56:58 2014 UTC,"OPEC sets market price by determining the supply. They don't have to trade directly with America. Think of it like this, if I buy gold from the local gold store at $100 per gram, and they get gold from their own mine with no connection to fictional OGEC. OGEC starts mining shit tons of gold and putting it into the market. Gold is less rare and the price per gram goes down. So even though my local store doesn't get gold from them, gold is less valuable due to increasing supply and my store will have to decrease their prices.  I mean they don't have to technically, but if the want to sell they won't keep their price higher than the market rate.   However, your assertion that we don't trade with OPEC is wrong, so all of that while true and interesting, doesn't matter. US-OPEC trade in millions."

But basically, we have the Patriot Act because we were so preoccupied with vengeance against Al-Qaeda, the countries the housed them, and terrorism I'm general, we didn't care what that did to innocent people. The country decided that anyone who went against the Patriot Act were unpatriotic, and we ridiculed them. We were collectively as a country still grieving. That's why we have the Patriot Act.  Why do we still have the Patriot Act. No one wants to either go against a bill called the patriot act, nor does anyone want to be the senator or representative responsible for repealing the Patriot Act only to have a terrorist attack happen shortly after.

libertarianmeme,2m2pqc,seattleandrew,6,Wed Nov 12 17:02:11 2014 UTC,"You first have to put yourself in the mindset of the time. 9/11 just happened and people were literally terrified. It was the first legitimate action on US soil by a foreign enemy since 1941. It happened on a regular monday and had a few circumstances been different 47,000 more people would have died. I shudder to think what would have happened had the buildings not been 90% empty that day. We would have randomly nuked patches of desert.   So everyone is hurt and afraid, and they don't know why this happened, who did it, or how to fight back. This is the people not the government. Then the government comes out with this plan ""hey we can find these people, we can track them down, and we can make you safe again."" Most people didn't need to hear more than that. Obviously many did and did object but their voices weren't loud enough.   For politicians voting against the patriot act would have been political suicide. Very few lived in districts that could understand this shit was bad news. Opposing the patriot act meant you supported the terrorists. How could you not want to do everything in your power to stop these people who killed innocent American civilians!? People where shamed and browbeated into submission.   There was also the fact that they needed the bill to be passed extremely quickly. We need this bill passed now or the trail will go cold and we won't catch the terrorists. There could even be more attacks! We need this now!   Through the process we had quotes like from Ashcroft and Bush.   Terrorism is a clear and present danger to Americans today, each day that so passes is a day that terrorists have an advantage.  We’re at war and in order to win the war, we must make sure the law enforcement men and women have got the tools necessary.   I was 11 years old when this was happening, and I actually remember asking my dad why the men on TV were trying to scare us. I knew that 9/11 was a bad thing, but I didn't get why they needed to make it sound even scarier. Like there were terrorists hiding under my bed waiting to blow up my mattress. They set up deadlines, they wanted it passed by October, then by the end of October. Towards the end of September the propaganda started getting really really bad.   Andrew Card comes in and says   Terrorist organizations, like al-Qaeda have probably found the means to use biological or chemical warfare.   Tommy Thompson (Director of HHS) tries to calm people but only makes it worse by telling people HHS actually thinks this stuff will happen and are preparing for it.   We’re prepared to take care of any contingency, any consequence that develops for any kind of biological attack.   On October 1st the Washington Post headline says Bush administration thinks more terrorist attacks likely, including chemical and biological weapons. He wasn't discredited at this point, everyone took this very seriously. Holy shit our president is saying this will happen again. Double holy shit, chemical and biological weapons what are we going to do. The article was an appeal to pass the patriot act. The whole thing.  On the same day a photo editor got sick, turns out he had inhaled anthrax and actually died of it a few days later. HOLY SHIT IT'S HAPPENING. People started carrying around freakin Cipro in case they got anthrax poisoning. It was absolute madness, people were terrified.   People found out Bush and Cheney were put on Cipro on 9/11 and there was a run on the stuff, pharmacies sold out of a drug they rarely ever used.   We started bombing Afghanistan, and every day new warnings from the FBI, or the president himself came out saying we were going to be attacked again. In early October IIRC on 10/11 because symbolism the FBI specifically warned of likely attacks in 'the next several days.' Literally everything from suicide bombers to crop-dusting aircraft filled with bio weapons. The FBI was saying this. On that day different versions of the patriot act had been passed in the house and senate, so it needed to go to reconciliation. Ashcroft starts harping about how talking doesnt solve terrorism.   On 10/15 a newspaper says 'Washington braces for anthrax attack.' The same day was the anthrax scare in the senate. Specifically two people who strongly opposed the bill Daschle and Leahy got mail with allegedly 'weapons grade' anthrax in it, and a note written with the reading level of a 3rd grader. After that people like Ashcroft tore into anyone who opposed patriot act like measures. Saying further attacks will happen until this law is passed.   The bill reconciled bill was introduced on 10/23/2001, it was brought to the floor the same day. Bush signed it into law 10/26. This stuff is part of why some people have conspiracy theories about 9/11. There was so much freakin propaganda and fearmongering and nonsense. So much trying to force everyones hand in such a short period of time. Eventually almost everyone buckled to that fear, and rather than doing the right thing now that they know what it does, they just keep reauthorizing the damn thing.   Hope that helps.

I remember learning that the library was required by law to keep a log of every book I checked out, so that if the government ever needed it as evidence they could come find out what information I decided to learn. Oh and they can't tell me if it happens. I stopped visiting libraries after that.   One think I do know is that I'm absolutely livid that not one single person is even talking about the god damned NSA anymore, and even through the midterm cycle zero of the candidates brought up the biggest government scandal since, well in my opinion since ever (in America). It's not very often you find out that your government is spying on well over a billion people, and pretty much everyone in your own country. It's already buried and it's only one year old. Fucking benghazi gets more airtime than Prism, and so the uniting and strengthening america by providing the appropriate tools to go fuck yourselves act will just get re-upped again and it makes me unnecessarily angry.   Well, sorry they are making a Hollywood movie about it -_- maybe that will at least make people care."

On the flip side, the GOP loonies call it Obamacare of the Internet ... which is even more offensive and lacking in substance than the FCC's actual proposal.  Net neutrality should be a simple one pager from Congress:  traffic may not be deliberately filtered or degraded by ISPs or backbones based upon traffic origin, traffic destination, or traffic content.   Exemptions granted for malicious traffic and spam.   Exemption granted for saturation of the line, when they should be able to throttle hoggier services like CDN delivery and P2P traffic to keep a high QoS throughout the network.  And while we're at it -- get the FCC to open up a big meaty chunk of spectrum for nationwide wireless broadband.

Throttling your internet because you use Netflix or YouTube is like the power company degrading your power for using an electric stove or a dryer. The internet has become such an important thing to the everyday lives of people that it's pretty much required like power. That's why it needs to be labeled title II and become a utility.

That is, Net Neutrality is anti-monopoly.   The analogy would be allowing corporations to buy sections of interstate 95, declare those sections ""private property"". Then exclude traffic from it. Exclude any traffic from the interstate whom they deem a ""competitor"".    If you think allowing that to happen is ""pro-small business"", you are nuts.  Now I understand this is a libertarian subreddit, and so you are chock full of  ""zero government"" crazies here. I understand that some of you here may somehow believe that selling off the interstate highway system to private investors would be a good plan. ( Understand that I don't mean the maintenance of such highways by bidding contractors. I mean selling them literally making them 'private land'. )  The libertarian ideal is that a ""free market"" allows a tiny competitor to come along and steal the show once a monopoly is charging too much or otherwise pissing their customers off.   Well, ironically,  net neutrality works in a way to enhance this.   The United States of America have gone through such ""trust-busting"" (so the speak) all the way back in the 19th century.   Net Neutrality does not create a government-run monopoly. Net Neutrality enhances the capacity of small start-ups to compete. Net Neutrality increases choices to the consumer.  In summary, net-neutrality is a pro-free market, pro-competition piece of legislation."
libertarianmeme,2m1fue,ATCaver,1 point,Sun Nov 16 21:27:41 2014 UTC,"I understand that some of you here may somehow believe that selling off the interstate highway system to private investors would be a good plan. ( Understand that I don't mean the maintenance of such highways by bidding contractors. I mean selling them literally making them 'private land'. )   Why yes, yes I do.   Net Neutrality does not create a government-run monopoly.   Well no, not right away. But look at what's happened in health care. Look at what's happened in finance. Look at what's happened in the automotive industry. Government nannying of an industry invariably creates an almost unbreakable oligopoly. Which brings me to your second point.   Net Neutrality enhances the capacity of small start-ups to compete.   Please explain. Are you talking about the ""regulate it like a Title II utility"" Net Neutrality, or the ""ban certain forms of packet discrimination, with exceptions for areas we already know about where filtering is necessary"" Net Neutrality? Normally an added regulatory burden makes it harder to compete with an incumbent, not easier.   Net Neutrality increases choices to the consumer.   The consumer already has multiple choices. What additional choices does a mere law create? Why is it worth holding a gun to anyone's head to create those choices?   In summary, net-neutrality is a pro-free market, pro-competition piece of legislation.   Saying it doesn't make it so. How do you have any idea whether ""Net Neutrality"" will look anything like your ideal version once Congress is through with it? Look at the federal government's track record everywhere else when it comes to regulation. Look at what the NSA has been up to. When you give this government an inch, they will take a mile. The minute you set that precedent, where federal bureaucrats have the power to invade an ISP and tell them how to relay packets, the Internet as we know it will be over. It will take a few years for you Pollyannas to realize your mistake, but by then it will be too late.  Our only hope at this point is the cypherpunks and the meshnet engineers. The propaganda campaign by the content providers has been so effective even ""libertarians"" are hoodwinked by this plea to shackle the web. We're just going to have to keep inventing darknets the regulators can't get at. Hopefully technology can outrun Western democracies' urge to bite the hand that feeds them."

One day robotics will make remote surgeries a possibility. Do you seriously want that traffic to have to contend with fucking cat videos when traversing the lines just for the sake of ""neutrality"", or do you want it to be utterly reliable?

libertarianmeme,2lzloe,YesYesLibertarians,2,Wed Nov 12 16:26:10 2014 UTC,"ISPs and customers should be able to negotiate rates and traffic shaping in whatever ways they please.   Customers purchase internet service with the expectation that their service will not be arbitrarily degraded when using certain services, along with a basic expectation of privacy. Traffic shaping makes sense only so far as basic QoS goes, and large scale QoS really only makes sense on a slow and poorly maintained network (more on that later). On the other hand, customers don't purchase internet service with the expectation that the ISP will throttle the customer-preferred movie streaming service so the ISP can make its own streaming service faster.   Imagine if the postal service were allowed to arbitrarily decide that for the same price, bank A (which the postal service owns) can send statements and checks to postal customers in 2 days and bank B has to wait two weeks. That would really piss people off. This is why we have ""common carrier"" statutes.  Similarly, customers don't purchase internet with the expectation that the ISP will conduct a man-in-the-middle attack and decrypt their secured information to banking, health care, and commerce websites in transit so that the ISP can both shape traffic and get marketing information. No one expects that their postal mail containing sensitive information will be intercepted in transit, opened, read by someone, and then delivered based on arbitrary decisions by the USPS.  Further, these companies have been given hundreds of billions of dollars by the federal government and monopolies at the state and local level which was supposed to be incentive to improve the networks so that everyone has access to high speed broadband Internet. This was the companies' own reasoning behind supporting this legislation with lobbyists, and if it had gone as promised then net neutrality would not even be an issue because the infrastructure could handle much larger throughput and packet shaping wouldn't even be necessary like it is today on America's horrid infrastructure. Yet instead of improving the infrastructure the companies pocketed the money, abused their monopolies, abused their customers with high prices and shitty service, and now no one trusts the companies to do the right thing without someone regulating them. The companies were given all the incentives in the world to act good, but didn't, and now they are about to get fucked good and fair by the government, and everyone is okay with that because nearly every ISP customer in the US has been getting fucked for a long time.  So net neutrality is really a combination of several issues. Customers expect reasonable service, reasonable privacy, reasonable prices, and they don't like getting fucked over by big companies that abuse their connections to big government."
libertarianmeme,2lzloe,BattlestarPotemkin,0,Wed Nov 12 16:35:20 2014 UTC,"I agree in a situation where ISPs have competition. However, with voter apathy and extremely low turn out that isn't going to happen any time soon. Right now there are three options that could happen:    ISPs get their wish and can make ""fast lanes"" while putting the screws to their customers because they have no choice (see Comcast).  The government gets involved and decides what data gets the ""fast lane"" treatment thus gaining the ability to censor it as they wish. The rule goes back to ""a packet is a packet is a packet.""   Of those three options yes, I would rather have my robotic surgeon competing with cat videos than have Comcast (without competition) or the government making the choice.  If there was a snowballs chance in hell of getting the ISP monopolies broken up then I have no problem with doing away with net neutrality. If you can come up with a viable alternative that will work in our current ISP-Monopoly setup then I'm all ears."
libertarianmeme,2lzloe,Jodah,1 point,Wed Nov 12 07:33:51 2014 UTC,"But Comcast does have competition. Where are these places where only a solitary ISP is providing all the Internet access?  Some of the impetus behind this ""Net Neutrality"" struggle is that content providers would benefit from price controlled bandwidth. The customers would foot the bill for the bandwidth they're currently paying a premium for. So to me option 1 is the least bad.  Frankly I think the best option of all would be to break up any ISP network that benefited from infrastructure giveaways (Comcast, AT&T) and make existing customers the shareholders of those new, smaller ISPs. Let the market take it from there and don't regulate QoS. The public gets their pound of flesh from Comcast, competition gets them better internet. Everyone's happy except the rentseekers."

Keep in mind the amount of lobbying ISPs are putting into net neutrality debates is nothing compared to what they would throw in if they are threatened with being broken up.   As much as I wish it wasn't the case libertarian political power is still a drop in the bucket. If we want to see any change we need to pick our battles and right now pushing to break up ISPs isn't the best choice. Trying to change everything at once is what turns people away from Libertarianism. We didn't get into this clusterfuck overnight and we aren't getting out of it overnight."

From a purely libertarian standpoint, that's the way it should be done anyway. However, if there's going to be a top-down Federal solution anyway, I'd much prefer that congress pass a law that makes monopoly agreements illegal than give some unelected bureaucrats total control over the internet."

We're dealing with people who support Obamacare and the Patriot Act. We're dealing with a 37% voter turn out rate. We're dealing with a 90% incumbent re-election rate. And that's at the federal level where the national media is involved. If you ask the average voter to name their city councilman or county legislator I would bet 8 out of 10 couldn't do it.   Maybe I'm just a cynical asshole who has no faith what-so-ever in my fellow man to actually change things to a more libertarian system but if I am right then I would rather have the old system of net neutrality than have ISP monopolies run roughshod over me.

And for web sites that have the ISP extortion racket hit them to go dark and replace their page with something that tells customers that they can't do what they want to do until said website pays the ISP and they're unwilling to do that.  I look forward to the day when a FIOS customer logs into Netflix on their roku and a scrolling message says ""Netflix recommends Google Fiber (or the ISP of your choice that doesn't charge provider fees.)  I think companies like Netflix, that are forced to pay to use the pipes of Verizon and Comcast, should have an additional surcharge as a separate line item on their bill that says ""Comcast Surcharge"" or ""Verizon Surcharge"" with a long letter explaining why the surcharge is there.  That way, the consumer has incentive to switch to a ""neutral"" ISP, because it saves them a few bucks on their bill.  We really need better educated consumers and detailed bills.  If people understand where the money is going and why, then they'll make proper choices."
libertarianmeme,2lzloe,plazman30,3,Tue Nov 11 21:44:46 2014 UTC,"The only reason that Google is able to roll out fiber, is because they have the clout and name to force cities to exempt them from local ISP regulations that require ISP's to serve all people within the city limits equally.

Now, a bunch of Republicans are put in office to protest the Democrats spending big on social welfare, which statistically doesn't reduce poverty and punishes people for working by the way. Notice both times the other party is voted into office because of problems with big government and big spending. The issue is that one side won't stop spending on social welfare and now war as well, and the other side won't stop spending on war.

These two groups are generally most informed about their own opinions on the matter and have worked themselves into a sense of total partisan certainty.  You and your opponent are fighting over the ""low-information voters"" (that is, either not very smart or not very engaged) to swing the needle ~2% in one direction or the other.

libertarianmeme,2lhh96,TommBomBadil,1 point,Thu Nov 6 18:50:11 2014 UTC,"The documentation in JFK and the Unthinkable is pretty thorough so far. I'm enjoying the book, as much as such a dark topic can be enjoyed.  Information came out in the 1990s and then again in 2007 that fills in the blanks regarding Oswald. Oswald's story looks like that of a man swaddled by the CIA every step of his life after leaving the military, with his final mission being that of a patsy in a political struggle over foreign policy.  I can't really do the book justice in a comment, but the TL;DR is that we know enough now to view JFK's assassination as an operation very similar to other CIA coups and plots of the period. The military-industrial-intelligence complex had the means, motive and opportunity. They had already become well-versed in underhanded false-flag plots, and had become pretty inventive at it since outright military confrontation was mostly ruled out by the President. They hated him for refusing to fight the Soviets directly. They viewed the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban missile crisis, and the nuclear test ban as humiliating defeats. It was not a big leap for them to think of JFK as a traitor.  This version of events does not require a vast and well-orchestrated cover-up. Fear and political pragmatism can explain why the Warren Report was such a sham. Tensions within the government being as high as they were, and the nation already grieving and unsteady, the people charged with picking up the pieces were forced to choose between three terrible options:   Confront a deadly CIA and make the investigation a factional battleground that would tear the country apart in a time when looking strong against the Russians felt essential.

ARTICLE III, SECTION 2, CLAUSE 1  http://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/2013/11/Debt-Chart.png  Ever since 1938, the national debt has been unpayable. We are currently at the point where 43% of the national debt is held by the Federal, local, and state governments. 57% of the national debt is held by bankers, foreign and domestic; private and state-owned.  57% held by bankers. Let that sink in. The global banking elite own our nation. Since these bankers are overseas that means that our court system, ever since 1938, has been an Admiralty judiciary. The United States justice system is no longer a common law judiciary.  This is the opportunity global elitist bankers needed for worldwide governing bodies to homogenize law and government planet-wide in order to strengthen their monopoly on economic control."

This is because its compression mechanism is made for images, while gif is just compressed with LZW.  Compared to GIF files, a PNG file with the same information (256 colors, no ancillary chunks/metadata), compressed by an effective compressor will normally be smaller than GIF.

libertarianmeme,2l6fim,aiasthetall,-7,Mon Nov 3 19:16:20 2014 UTC,"That isn't a fair comment. Those cases have nothing to do with Tesla not being able to sell cars, but to protect franchise dealers from customers going directly to the manufacturer. If Tesla had franchised dealerships, they could sell to their hearts content. It would apply to Ford if they tried to sell Explorers directly to the public.  As for Uber and companies like that, it's also a matter of unregulated, shit box cars that, possibly, shouldn't even be on the road, let alone used as taxi's. What happens when one of these cars doesn't have insurance and plows into a bus killing 30 kids? There are genuine public concerns involved. I'm not saying the cab companies aren't looking out for themselves, but there are legit issues here."
libertarianmeme,2l6fim,keith_weaver,15,Mon Nov 3 22:03:02 2014 UTC,What happens when one of these cars doesn't have insurance and plows into a bus killing 30 kids?   The same thing that happens when anyone plows into a bus killing 30 kids. Not sure what the issue is here.
libertarianmeme,2l6fim,HerrBBQ,-5,Mon Nov 3 22:19:09 2014 UTC,"The issue is, taxi companies are regulated and bonded/insured. If I say, 'hey, I think I'll rent my car out today...' and I don't have an ounce of insurance or have the minimum allowed by law for an individual, and a person that isn't even on my car's insurance kills 30 people, you seriously can't see where problems may occur? What if my car just catches fire because it is massively unroadworthy and kills the guy that rented it? That's why there are laws and regulations out there. No individual's insurance can cover a massive accident like this. You could end up with dozens of families destroyed. It's not just a matter of big meanies trying to keep you from making a living.  I fully agree that cab companies have an absurd monopoly. In my state, and this is no joke, you must face a board and the cab companies, and prove that there isn't enough competition. The board then asks the cab company representatives if they feel there is adequate competition, to which the cab companies say, ""Yes, there is already enough competition."" Case closed, no cab license for you. That is a sack of nonsense that needs to end. As long as you are insured/bonded properly and have cars that pass inspection, you should be able to make a go of it. But unregulated Joe Blow is bad news."
libertarianmeme,2l6fim,keith_weaver,10,Mon Nov 3 22:31:04 2014 UTC,"Uber and Lyft don't accept just anyone to be a driver.  From Uber's FAQ-   Who can be a driver?  Anyone with a valid drivers license, personal car insurance, a clean record, and a car. No special drivers license or previous experience required. Your car must have 4 doors (ex. Prius, Fusion, Accord) and meet your city’s requirements (2004 or newer).   Also, they have insurance that covers the rider and driver as well."

That is where I have an issue. One chap had a 90something Honda that t-boned a girl heading home from school. The car had no insurance and the driver had no license or insurance so now that girl's family is stuck with all of it.

I'm jumping off this treadmill because you just don't get my points. Driver X may be using Uber or Lyft or any other similar scheme to get business, but if Driver X is involved in an accident and isn't insured for commercial business an insurance company can withhold payments and deny claims. I've been in the insurance industry and know this to be true. My argument isn't against companies being able to start up and make a go of it, but they do need to have a minimum level of protection for their clients/users and the general public in case of an accident."
libertarianmeme,2l6fim,keith_weaver,7,Tue Nov 4 15:57:34 2014 UTC,You don't think requiring a middle man stifles competition/innovation?
libertarianmeme,2l6fim,aiasthetall,-1,Mon Nov 3 22:11:56 2014 UTC,"If I'm Tesla, it makes ZERO difference to me if I sell to you or a franchised dealer that sells to you. It may cost you a few more bucks, but no innovation is stifled. In fact, Tesla would probably make substantially more by selling franchise rights and collecting on those rights yearly, on top of auto sales, which would finance their product development. You then have dealers that need mechanics and sales and administrative staff, which helps local economies.  As other makers enter that specific market, each manufacturer needs to produce a better product and/or sell that product at a better price to entice customers. The argument being posed was that Tesla was being unfairly targeted, when all of the other manufacturers have to go by these laws as well, not just Tesla. The playing field was even."
libertarianmeme,2l6fim,keith_weaver,5,Mon Nov 3 22:41:27 2014 UTC,"You didn't answer the question.  Claiming that charging more for the same product increases demand is a flawed assertion. If it costs people more for the same product, tesla is going to sell less. So it does matter to tesla.   Regulators requiring a higher initial investment on the consumer's part will in turn make tesla less profitable and the market less attractive, thereby  decreasing the likelihood that the other manufacturers will get involved. Naturally fewer manufacturers means less competition increasing the qualities of the goods whole driving down the cost.   Claiming that with supressed demand franchises will be in demand is ridiculous. *edit for phone formatting"
libertarianmeme,2l6fim,aiasthetall,0,Mon Nov 3 23:00:30 2014 UTC,"I didn't say charging more would increase the demand, only that it would hinder it because a middle man is involved. Tesla is massively profitable, (which amazes me that reddit is so in love with them). If you feel having a franchised dealer is a hindrance, why not fight for Ford and GM to be rid of the law? Ford and GM are among the largest companies in the world and have to abide by these laws. Why should Tesla be any different?   Tesla's profitability won't make any more or less interested in the market. If there is a genuine market and money is to be made, the manufacturers will be there."
libertarianmeme,2l6fim,keith_weaver,3,Mon Nov 3 23:09:11 2014 UTC,"That's what I'm saying... a middle man would hinder demand because charging more (unless it's a negligible amount) decreases demand. The government bail outs of yesteryear call into question the profitability. Tesla's their profitability is directly related to the market. If there is no money to be made, no one will enter the market unless your definition of market somehow assumes a profit. I'm getting the sense you're trolling, under slept or somehow not on your mental game, so I wish you a good day."
libertarianmeme,2l6fim,aiasthetall,-1,Mon Nov 3 23:15:48 2014 UTC,"I'm not trolling or any of that. People are acting as though the government has targeted Tesla and that just isn't the case. Ford can't sell directly to the public, like it or not, they are just telling Tesla to follow the already and long established laws. Of course fewer costs helps the consumer, not that a few hundred (if that) is too hurtful to a person spending 70k+ on a car that can't venture too far from home.   Just because there is a retail center doesn't mean there can't be competition or innovation, or even lots of competition or innovation. Pretty much the entirety of the US economy is sales. Do you think the furniture store made that couch you now own or was there a middle man involved? I didn't go to Steve Jobs to buy my iphone. I didn't even get it from the Apple store, I went to Verizon. Does that mean that Samsung doesn't exist? Do their products no longer exist because I can't purchase them direct? Have there been no advancements or innovations in phone tech because of middle men? Granted, phones are different from cars, but middlemen don't stifle anything when the product is good and in demand."
libertarianmeme,2l6fim,keith_weaver,2,Mon Nov 3 23:30:13 2014 UTC,I'm not too knowledgeable about cars and the automotive industry. What's so bad about going directly to the manufacturer? Shouldn't a company be allowed to sell their product in whatever manner they wish?
libertarianmeme,2l6fim,UseKnowledge,1 point,Tue Nov 4 06:26:30 2014 UTC,"I would love to go to the manufacturer directly but franchise owners have lobbied to keep these laws in place. If Fortune 500 Company X needs to purchase 1000 vans this quarter, it benefits the franchised dealer to have the laws and get a piece of that action. Just from a logistical viewpoint, it's easier for the manufacturer to sell to franchises. Ford sells millions of cars per year, imagine taking all of those orders in one spot and then distributing the autos. My main point wasn't to argue being able to sell directly or not, but that people keep saying that these laws are being passed to stifle Tesla sales when these laws have been around for decades and everyone has been following them. The deck isn't being stacked against Tesla because everyone has to follow those very same rules."
libertarianmeme,2l6fim,keith_weaver,-1,Tue Nov 4 15:47:33 2014 UTC,"I live in the US and many states, including the one in which I live, do not have yearly inspections. Yes, even here, we are required to have, at a minimum, collision insurance that would pay for the other guy's damages. That doesn't mean that people don't go to Joe's Overnight Insurance Co and get a bare bones policy and then cancel that policy once they get their tags renewed. It happens often. The state's minimum requirements here, allow for damages up to and not exceeding $500k. And that is when the owner or people that are allowed to drive the car and are registered on the insurance. If you, my random friend, are driving my car and plow into 30 people, the insurance company can tell me to pound sand up my ass. It would be fair to assume that since I am renting out my car, I probably wouldn't have the funds in my bank to pay for hospital bills for multiple people. Not to mention covering a law suit if fatalities are involved. It would probably be safe to assume that you wouldn't have that cash laying around either. Are you starting to see any light here?"

""Oh, well, it was my choice to ride with him and I'll just go ahead and pay for my own medical bills..."" How likely is that scenario?   That's been my only argument against these companies. Not Uber or Lyft per se, but the unregulated portion of it. I'm not a fan of government but business that deals with public safety matters should be held to a standard."

I wish merely to observe here that this controversy over universal suffrage (as well as most other political questions) which agitates, excites, and overthrows nations, would lose nearly all of its importance if the law had always been what it ought to be. In fact, if law were restricted to protecting all persons, all liberties, and all properties; if law were nothing more than the organized combination of the individual's right to self defense; if law were the obstacle, the check, the punisher of all oppression and plunder — is it likely that we citizens would then argue much about the extent of the franchise?  Under these circumstances, is it likely that the extent of the right to vote would endanger that supreme good, the public peace? Is it likely that the excluded classes would refuse to peaceably await the coming of their right to vote? Is it likely that those who had the right to vote would jealously defend their privilege? If the law were confined to its proper functions, everyone's interest in the law would be the same.

libertarianmeme,2l66k0,ArsonKing20,6,Tue Nov 4 01:17:56 2014 UTC,"Read Capitalism and the Historians and you'll have a better idea what this is about. There are some stock charges against the market, and some point to the Industrial Revolution as evidence.  ""It made workers worse off"" - The truth is that there were many factors contributing to poverty, and industrialization was making superhuman progress against them. You also had an activist government commissioning zillions of studies on worker quality of life because for the first time ever the government gave a crap. Add to that an old-money, aristocratic intelligentsia with an axe to grind against the nouveau riche entrepreneurs, and it should be clear that there were vested interests in making the factories sound as terrible as possible. Ever wonder where we get the term ""wage slave?"" Industrialization was allowing non-slave labor to decimate slave labor in the marketplace, so the conservatives who favored keeping slavery had to come up with something to make their opponents look bad.  Academics also complained workers had to live in dark, poorly ventilated apartments. But the government charged a tax on how many windows you had. Incentives matter!  ""It created modern (evil) capitalism"" - The hard-line anti-capitalists will say that capitalism as we know it depended on the British process of ""enclosure"", by which previously public lands that the farmers used got stolen from them by the government and given to robber barons to build their factories on. But those common lands were suffering from a tragedy of the commons in the first place. While it was wrong to give the factory builders first dibs, it was not wrong to let the property finally be owned by someone.  There's definitely more than this, it's in that book, but let it suffice to say that the usual statist's narrative of the Industrial Revolution goes like this:   Everybody was happy and fulfilled on their farms. The evil factories showed up and shoveled formerly happy people into putrid, soot-stained urban environments. The Nanny State burst in on a white horse with a sword and a pen, and subdued the evil capitalists with labor laws. Hooray, modern economy!   The version of events not tainted by bad economics is more like this: Life was shit, someone invented machines to make it less shit. Once life started getting better, the ivory tower folks thought any hardship at all was a crime against humanity, and tried to outlaw life being shit. Fortunately the market did that for them already."

Divorce for example splits wealth, splits the value of sharing space and etc. It also potentially forces both individuals to work (often at a disadvantage to one side of that equation.)  Just as bad (iirc) is children, you are way more likely to be poor trying to feed extra mouths. Now add in divorce or another form of separation or lake of cohesion and it just makes it that much worse.   While I know I'm responding to a meme/macro here, it's interesting to make note that the above two situation account for a large proportion of why people are poor - which also tends to perpetuate.   tl;dr - Broken homes + kids can => no family time and/or => poor education (for parent or child) and/or => low incomes"

But decent people do want law and order, and since society is predominantly made up of decent people, the market can provide it. It just wouldn't be provided by a monopoly that can attack competitors and just get away with it the way governments do.  The multitude of providers will compete but it's likely they would also standardize on a few things in order to save time/better serve customers. You'd have a form of common law. You already pay a private entity (insurance) in order to stabilize your life in case of disasters or crimes happening to your car, house, your business, or your ability to work. Now imagine those companies have the leeway to take the initiative in making your community safer by taking preventative measures against accidents, public health hazards, crime, or hunting down criminals to make them restore their victims.  Still, it would be wrong to imagine they would do all the things governments do today in exactly the way governments do them.

A law is a rule rule imposed and enforced by government. How is ""crime"" still a thing in ancap society? (This is not rhetorical, I am sincerely looking forward to your answer.) What is considered right, wrong or morally justified is completely personal and in no way universal. Relying on random strangers to have the same set of morals as you for your survival is maybe not the best plan."
libertarianmeme,2kqqcp,puttputt_in_thebutt,2,Thu Oct 30 17:03:03 2014 UTC,"Sorry about not replying to your points in order, but I have to address the last one first. In an ancap society, the lack of government does not mean there is a lack of law. An ancap society would have law enforcement and courts like we do now- but they'd be privately funded as opposed to funded with tax dollars. People would still mold how society functioned, so what is considered ""right"" and ""wrong"" would still be determined by the people who live in that society. Mostly, itd operate by the Non-Agression Principle, a set of ideals that would be generally agreed upon. When you water it down to the simplest terms, it basically says that harming anyone else or their property is immoral. However, it does not say that a person who may harm another in self defense is immoral.  As for your making a theoretical point, you just really can't simplify a situation like that down, but lets just say for the sake of argument that you are a better shot. It most definitely does not justify your actions since you provoked the situation and brought harm to somebody in a situation that didn't involve you protecting yourself, going right against the NAP."
libertarianmeme,2kqqcp,Fulaxi,0,Thu Oct 30 19:58:58 2014 UTC,"Thanks for replying in a way that is not bigoted. I really appreciate it. It happens too often.   An ancap society would have law enforcement and courts like we do now- but they'd be privately funded as opposed to funded with tax dollars.   Privately funded by whom, I wonder. If this ancap society resembles the current society in any way, this would mean that it would be the megacorporations that will be doing the law making and law enforcing. (They are, after all, the only actors that can afford vast expenses as such, disregarding governments.) This in itself doesn't have to be bad, but I'll come back to that in a minute.   People would still mold how society functioned, so what is considered ""right"" and ""wrong"" would still be determined by the people who live in that society.   Of course, of course. 'Right' and 'wrong' will still be roughly defined by the populace, but those constructs matter little when there's a law-controlling corporation that in no way has any responsibility to the people the rule of law applies to. And there's the problem with ancap society: corporations controlling law. Capitalist organisations, by their very nature, are primarily focused on financial gain. Upholding the law would simply be another means to the end of making money. This conflicts with the idea that the law exists to protect the people in general, not to facilitate profit for corporate leaders.    Mostly, itd operate by the Non-Agression Principle, a set of ideals that would be generally agreed upon. When you water it down to the simplest terms, it basically says that harming anyone else or their property is immoral.    Here you are wandering into some vague territory. The thing that baffles me most is 'a set of ideals that would be generally agreed upon'. Agreed upon by whom? By the corporate leaders or every person in such a society? The first of those will only agree on what is most profitable (and therefor not necessarily in line with the welfare of the people) and good luck finding a common ground if you're taking an entire population. People don't agree on shit.   As for your making a theoretical point, you just really can't simplify a situation like that down, but lets just say for the sake of argument that you are a better shot. It most definitely does not justify your actions since you provoked the situation and brought harm to somebody in a situation that didn't involve you protecting yourself, going right against the NAP.   My points on the NAP of course apply here, but let's get one thing out of the way: I'm not actually going to harm anyone. This is theoretical. There's no situation to simplify, for it does not exist.   Again: thanks for being a reasonable and so far pretty interesting person."
libertarianmeme,2kqqcp,SocialistsLOL,6,Thu Oct 30 20:43:14 2014 UTC,"What is a statist? http://i.imgur.com/H0fqjp7.jpg  Voluntaryism or Anarcho Capitalism is the fullest expression of liberty. It's liberty in its purest form, follow liberty to it's logically consistant conclusion and it's the result. It's the end game you could say. Anarchy doesn't mean lawlessness and chaos, it just means there's no government, no central entity enforcing their monopoly of force upon everybody.  An anarcho capitalist or voluntary society is one that is built upon self ownership, consent, and property rights, also no coercion or no initiation of force.   People only interact with each other and partake in peaceful voluntary transactions where they can trade their property for mutual benefit without a third party (a government) forcefully involving themselves.  Succinctly put, anarcho capitalism is about adult individuals interacting with other individuals in any way, as long as they do not harm others or other people's property (i.e. live peacefully).

If you want change, do something about it and vote 3rd party. People already don't vote 3rd party even though they agree with the issues because they believe it's wasting a vote, but once they see it rise from 1% to 3% to 10% to 25% of the votes, people will start participating."

I've never seen anything like how it is in NH. There is activism going on every night. There are like minded people producing media, cop-blocking, and participating in other civil disobedience. It's growing tremendously.  The agorist markets are larger than anywhere I've seen or heard of in the country.  Lots of people dedicated to being anti-state and dedicated to providing alternatives solutions to stat problems.  They have 15 members elected to state government; some anarchists.  Where the hell is that happening anywhere else?  This is with only ~1700 Free Staters in NH. The other ~16,000 who haven't moved yet are going to be a huge force in years to come.  I'm a signer and hope to be there within a couple years. At the very least, come up to Manchester in March for the Liberty Forum and just see for yourself. What they're doing in NH is unlike anything I ever thought was possible."
libertarianmeme,2kmo44,Anenome5,1 point,Tue Nov 11 19:56:51 2014 UTC,"All of that is laudable, as you say--with perhaps the exception of electing candidates. FSP seems therefore to be a lightning rod of minarchist-inclined libertarians, or at least those willing to work within the political system for change.  Personally I do not think that strategy of working within the political system is likely to produce the ultimate  result we want.  I think creating a libertarian culture and group consciousness there is quite valuable and impressive. But I hope people do not think it is going to result in large-scale change ultimately. Even if the FSP ended up dominating politics in NH, that's where it ends. The Fed can crush you like a bug from there, you always need their permission to secede and thus secession will not and can not ever happen there.  I hope people there don't become extremely discouraged when they discover this and begin hitting up against that wall.  It's certainly a much better thing than what we used to do, just stew in silence, alone. Such a place is great for putting together libertarians, and when that happens you get a magnification of ideology, resolve, and ideas. That's what I'm excited about for the FSP.  That said, I ultimately expect that FSP members will move onto seasteads in order to take the ultimate leap into statelessness which isn't possible within NH. But that could be two decades away perhaps."

The entire idea of them is the government seizing property without payment for that property based on an incredibly low standard to do so. This car may very well have been a drug dealers. But that fact alone shouldn't mean that the car is seized. I'd bet they took this because it was ""used in a crime."" In other words, the dealer drove it to the place where he was selling. But weirdly enough, the police only seem to take things that are worth a lot of money. Hell, there was a police chief who recently spoke at a county commission meeting stating that the police target individuals with ""toys they want, but can't afford.""  Most people can't afford to fight the system, so they are forced to give up their property. Just FYI, it's the individuals burden to prove that their property wasn't used in a crime, not the governments to prove that it was.   I appreciate that you recognize that the police shouldn't have a mentality of ""taking your shit,"" but this goes much deeper than simply seizing actual criminals' property. There is a fundamental flaw in the law itself that incentivizes law enforcement to seize property without regard to whether the person is actually a criminal. To break it down, this Esacalde could have been belonged to a soccer mom who shared a vicodin with her friend just as much as it could have belonged to a gangster who was terrorizing their block. And that's a problem."

There's an automatic assumption that there was ""not a crime"" and the cops just wanted the car.... and that's sad.  Drug trafficking convictions take a lot more than a $20 weed transaction."

Just because you and I can fathom that some pierce-faced freak might be the most skilled surgeon in the land it doesn't change the fact that very few employers want to hire him to interact with their customers.
