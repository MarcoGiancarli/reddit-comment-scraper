asktransgender,3e2nm3,Greta_Garbanzo,13,Tue Jul 21 14:29:38 2015 UTC,Maybe it was intentional.
asktransgender,3e2nm3,Greta_Garbanzo,10,Tue Jul 21 15:28:43 2015 UTC,I just don't see how it could be. The email was automated and one has never been sent before. No idea why it was ever sent to begin with.
asktransgender,3e2nm3,wendingwind,12,Tue Jul 21 15:32:34 2015 UTC,That's incredibly bizarre then. Whatever emailer Walgreens is using is bad or has bad data issues. I can't imagine being outed like that. Outing trans clients can be incredibly dangerous. Yikes.
asktransgender,3e2nm3,wendingwind,12,Tue Jul 21 15:37:49 2015 UTC,"I know. We are both just amazed that this could happen. Especially right now with trans rights being a hot button issue, they just kinda screwed themselves.    It must have something to do with accounts being linked. Either way, it was an unauthorized communication of sensitive information."
asktransgender,3e2nm3,fuckmylife333,6,Tue Jul 21 15:39:00 2015 UTC,"No matter the cause, it was a terrible violation of HIPPA that could have ruined her life. Her parents could have gone postal."
asktransgender,3e2nm3,fuckmylife333,3,Tue Jul 21 20:17:03 2015 UTC,It had to be intentional if the parent's email is not on her account.
asktransgender,3e2nm3,Raythe,8,Tue Jul 21 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"It's possible that if there was lab work involved that old information was on file (when she was on her parents' insurance, etc, stuff like that).   I'm on my own insurance plan. Only gave my endo my personal address, email, and own insurance plan. They didn't submit my insurance to Labcorp to process my bloodwork for some reason, and without the new info Labcorp still had my old billing info on file from years ago.  W/o my insurance, Labcorp sent a bill for my bloodwork to my parents' house. My mother didn't open it but she wouldn't stop asking questions, and it sped up the process for me coming out to them. I was so mad."
asktransgender,3e2nm3,evilpenguin234,7,Tue Jul 21 17:56:02 2015 UTC,"She has had her own insurance for quite some time now. I think before she was 25. I know she has had some labcorp bills sent to her parents house, but they don't open them. The mail was still addressed to her."

My endo sends results over email but the email is just to notify me it's ready - I have to log into a secure patient portal with a username and password. I cannot believe they would send medical and Rx information directly in an email - email is NOT a secure enough medium for that kind of thing. I've worked in health care systems before and they have very strict guidelines for medical info over email if it's going outside of the email network/intranet. Just...wow."
asktransgender,3e2nm3,NinjaUnicorn_17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:01:30 2015 UTC,I know :( You can see on walgreens website that it is a program you specifically have to opt into. My partner never did.
asktransgender,3e2nm3,NinjaUnicorn_17,29,Tue Jul 21 20:15:01 2015 UTC,When i got my lab work done a few weeks ago the paperwork that was automatically filled out had the apartment that my parents and i stayed in for all of 6 months while our house was being built... that was 17 years ago i have no idea where they got that info but it was weird. Could be something like that although i didn't have such severe reprocusssions and im really sorry that happened :(
asktransgender,3e2nm3,PotassiumArsenic,8,Tue Jul 21 20:44:25 2015 UTC,"Yup, this is where you find a lawyer and see what you can do. If you're close to any sort of major city then your local LGBT group should have a few names of lawyers who are known to be gay and trans friendly. Contact them and set up an appointment and find out your options  As someone who got outed to her parents in a similar way (the place where i got my initial bloodwork done sent copies to my folks and they started asking too many uncomfortable questions) I know this is going to be pretty rough for you guys. I chose to bite the bullet and come out completely, which went poorly. I hope whatever you decide on goes better."

asktransgender,3e2nm3,lgbtparanoia,5,Tue Jul 21 20:52:35 2015 UTC,It was the walgreens attached to the clinic that was referenced in the email

asktransgender,3e2nm3,taylor-in-progress,11,Tue Jul 21 21:28:55 2015 UTC,"This is 100% a HIPAA violation. You need to get in contact with a lawyer who deals with these cases.  Blatant blatant blatant negligence.  The biggest issue I have from being a prior HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, it bothers me when people type HIPPA) security officer is that if they breached your privacy, how many others got breach due to similar negligence?  My below comment has more details on emailing PHI. You can also call a HIPAA breach hotline and inform them of the violation (it's been a few years so I don't recall the number). I know no amount of money can repair the damage done, but they will be facing fines up to $250,000 and the person who leaked it potentially faces jail time, shit's that serious (it has been a year since I worked there, so the Omnibus could have changed, but it's not likely it changed that much)"
asktransgender,3e2nm3,nuovo_donna,5,Tue Jul 21 17:26:46 2015 UTC,"I just went back and revised all my posts where I accidentally typed ""HIPPA"". I just type it like you say it. Whoops.    Thanks for your help. We will be calling to report the HIPAA breach and talking with a lawyer."
asktransgender,3e2nm3,nuovo_donna,8,Tue Jul 21 17:37:01 2015 UTC,"If I were in your shoes, I would definitely be talking with a lawyer, and Walgreens would be paying for my transition and my move to Canada. You better believe when I got done with them I'd put Caitlyn's transition to shame and no one would ever question I was anything other than cis.  But see, if this happened to me I don't have to worry about family judging because they shoved me back in the closet in my teens and I hate them for it and rarely talk to them. I'd drag them through the mud with the media too and when the uproar over my case died down in the community I'd silently disappear into stealth and just live my life as girl."
asktransgender,3e2nm3,wendingwind,2,Tue Jul 21 20:12:25 2015 UTC,"You probably already found this through googling, but you can file a HIPAA complaint on the U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services webpage.

asktransgender,3e2nm3,tanuki_chau,2,Tue Jul 21 14:41:51 2015 UTC,We are in the process of filing a HIPPA violation through HHS and walgreens. Thanks!
asktransgender,3e2nm3,tanuki_chau,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:36 2015 UTC,This was my first thought. Like that's a huge violation. And they can be fined big time.
asktransgender,3e2nm3,tanuki_chau,3,Tue Jul 21 16:07:26 2015 UTC,"This is bad! No law background (or medical, for that matter), but this is considered PHI (private health information) since they gave out her name and prescription info.  Also, since when does Walgreens give your prescription info in the email? Doesn't it usually say ""[name here], your prescriptions are ready to be picked up at [address here]."" or something like that?  You will more than likely be able to get a huge settlement on this (and maybe even a change of policy for the very sensitive emails).  Unfortunately, what is done is done; neither you nor your SO can travel back in time, although if you do manage to convince her parents otherwise, great. I don't really feel qualified to give tips on how to do so, considering I don't know their ways of thinking (or how gullible they are). Maybe sending fake spam to mask the refill reminder and make your story more believable?"
asktransgender,3e2nm3,tanuki_chau,4,Tue Jul 21 14:41:38 2015 UTC,Do you think the settlement could pay for a time machine? Or one of those Men in Black mind eraser thingies? Thats really the only thing I can think of that might help :(    I know this is considered PHI and I cannot fathom how it could be sent to the WRONG email. We have no idea how these accounts ever got linked.
asktransgender,3e2nm3,tanuki_chau,5,Tue Jul 21 14:46:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, if only it would! Nah... But maybe it could be enough for a DeLorean. I've also found that, in a pinch, a wooden baseball bat can substitute an eraser thingy; though sometimes it's a little too effective. :P  Honestly, based on what you've been saying on other branches of this thread, it mostly seems like they just looked at your SO's last name and her parent email and said ""ehh, close enough.""  Or maybe, if it's automated, the email server's query to the database is flawed since it returned both her profile and her parent's email. Or maybe, the database itself is flawed, ooh I've seen many a crappy database, it wouldn't surprise me.  Or maybe... her parents linked the account to their email without your SO noticing. Since it's only their last name, it seemed plausible enough for an employee to buy it."
asktransgender,3e2nm3,vancitygal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:24 2015 UTC,"The DeLorean is her dream car. I'm sure I couldn't talk her out of getting one if we did get a handsome settlement. As much as the money would be nice, the loss of family can't be replaced by that. Its just so painful for her and for me.    Even in any of those cases, it seems like a giant humongous HIPPA violation. Not at any point did she authorize her information to be sent via email or phone or to anyone but her me and her emergency contact (who is not her parents)."
asktransgender,3e2nm3,LikeGoldAndFaceted,2,Tue Jul 21 15:02:46 2015 UTC,"It is true, that money can't replace family. But, a few things:   You said her father's been saying hurtful things these past few days, has he been like that before they got the email? Also, if it's okay with you, what has he been saying? You've only mentioned her father reacting like this, what about her mother? her siblings? Even though her coming out was a bit... hastened by this, wouldn't she have had to tell them regardless? If they (though, I'm only sure of her father) reacted like this, wouldn't they have reacted the same (if not, worse) if she had told them personally?   Also, I am definitely not arguing with you; it doesn't matter why, it's still a HIPPA violation. Especially since most ALL of the reasons I've outlined are rooted in negligence by the employees."
asktransgender,3e2nm3,LikeGoldAndFaceted,6,Tue Jul 21 15:18:08 2015 UTC,"Its more like very subtly comments that are anti-trans. Her parents have known she is trans since 2001 when she tried to commit suicide. She was subsequently hospitalized, wrongfully diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and sent to finish high school at some school for troubled kids out west. Basically, she came out to them and they sent her away.    Her father recently has said she needs to cut her hair and trim her nails or they won't continue to financially support her while she is out of work. She works in film and there isn't much filming lately. It is hard to find work. Now, its not as if she is wearing a skirt or a dress when she goes and sees them. She presents androgynous outside the house for her own safety. In the past he has said things like ""If you start transition, you are out of the family"", ""You can do whatever you want when I am dead"", ""I wouldn't trust you with a gun (suicide related I think)"".    Her mother is trying to understand, but still thinks that she should just remain male. She fears for her safety as a transgender woman. She also fears being shunned by family and friends, a scenario we both believe to be highly unlikely. She is adopted (so am I oddly enough) and has no siblings in that family, but a few half brothers who are pretty cool with it.    They already know she is trans, but the highly disagree with transition. That is the problem. It would have happened eventually, yes, but I think everyone can agree they would rather it be on their own terms.. not through an email from walgreens.    Perhaps it would have been worse, but I think her plan was to come out to the whole family about being trans to gauge if there would be some familial support before saying she has been on HRT. That was the idea... at least."

Also her father seems to be a royal arse, again, more common than I thought. At least her mum is trying.  And actually coming out to the entire family at once would've definitely been better. But alas, you can't change the past.  Actually, one more thing, if her parents have such a... polarizing opinion that, especially her father's, is so strong, and she is obviously being hurt by this (and you too, because empathy), why do you two remain in contact with her parents? What about them outshines the hurt that they (mostly your father) dish out?"
asktransgender,3e2nm3,alongstrangetrip,6,Tue Jul 21 15:45:48 2015 UTC,"Yep, I know it is pretty typical for trans people. :(    He is precisely a royal arse. He is self centered and just a complete ass hole. He has his moments where he is nice, but usually his mouth catches up with him and he says something idiotic. Its really not new. Her mom is indeed trying and I am clinging to that so hard lol. I even sent her a massive link list of helpful documents and articles specifically aimed at partners and family members of trans people. I hope she reads some of it.    I have a feeling that other members of her family will be accepting. I think seeing that acceptance will help her parents feel more secure.    As much as they are in denial about all this, they are good people. They have helped us out when we've been in a pinch, we have dinner with them regularly, we go to family functions at least once a month. For the most part its just sort of been ""avoiding the subject"" which has kept the waters calm. Hiding her transition has helped keep everything ""normal"" for them. She is trying to allow them time to process that transition will be happening... they just don't know it already has."
asktransgender,3e2nm3,KatherineDuskfire,3,Tue Jul 21 15:51:55 2015 UTC,"Hmm, now I see why the Walgreens fiasco affected you two so much.

asktransgender,3e2nm3,KatherineDuskfire,4,Tue Jul 21 16:02:10 2015 UTC,That's just a complete nightmare. That's the last place I got my T refilled at as well. This is definitely not OK. Anything involving shading of personal health information like this is supposed to be opt in. Email especially is quite insecure. I really hope you get this figured out but I know nothing can undo what was done.
asktransgender,3e2nm3,KatherineDuskfire,5,Tue Jul 21 17:17:18 2015 UTC,"FWIW, Walgreens has been fucking up lately.  They're currently involved in a class action suit over unrequested and unauthorized robo calls to tell people to renew prescriptions or to pick them up because they're ready.    I suspect there is a privacy breach here.  Was she able to print out the email?  It's going to be pretty necessary proof.  It's going to be tough I think to find an attorney willing to take a case like this with a single petitioner on a pro bono or contingency basis.  I recommend emailing the Transgender Law Center with your inquiry.    I hope the fall out from this isn't too bad for her.  Realistically, they were going to find out pretty soon anyway.  It's hard to hide HRT effects from family you're living with indefinitely, but of course the disclosure should have been on her timeline not the fucking drugstore."
asktransgender,3e2nm3,KatherineDuskfire,5,Tue Jul 21 20:01:32 2015 UTC,"I did see the class action lawsuit. We saved the email but have not printed it yet. I will probably bust out the ole printer tonight and get some hard copies.    Transgender Law Center is located in Cali it looks like, could they still help us here in Illinois? I'm hoping we can find a good attorney to take the case. Still waiting to hear back.    The fall out is already not great. Dunno what long term damage this will do to her relationship with her parents :( We live together and she sees her parents weekly. I think they were pretty clueless about her medical transition up til now."
asktransgender,3e2nm3,KatherineDuskfire,5,Tue Jul 21 20:21:50 2015 UTC,"They'll likely advise you and may be able to help refer you to someone. They should at least be able to tell you whether this is even actionable.  I doubt anyone there has passed the IL bar though.  I hope things get better!  Sometimes it's good when things get shoved out.  I didn't really want to be out to my Mom, but my family did it for me (to me, whatever).  She turned into my biggest early supporter though, so sometimes it's good to get things out in the open."
asktransgender,3e2nm3,Bacilli,10,Tue Jul 21 20:26:24 2015 UTC,"The hung up on her because they have nothing to tell you that won't hurt them legally. They really, really fucked up. You should sue. You will win."

That's corporate. So she'll have better luck calling them direct. Also there is a sad and depressing reason why you haven't seen many things about this vs HIPPA law. A case like this I don't believe has been tried before.   Either way sorry to hear about this I think at this point it's a foregone conclusion that her coming schedule has been impacted. Basically it's time to regroup and assess.

It's crappy but in the long run its just a blip. It's a crap thing that happened. You get up try to fix it, you move on. Just don't let you or her dwell on it."
asktransgender,3e2nm3,ImKira,3,Tue Jul 21 14:51:09 2015 UTC,I know she was planning on telling them (at least her mom) very soon. On her own terms. It just really messed with how she planned on this going down. It is extremely unfortunate that they had to find out this way. I know we can't change it... it just feels like a dream.    We have recently had a massive stroke of bad luck. My cat had to be hospitalized and cost us $1000. I was in a car accident and my car has been in the shop for 3 weeks now. Insurance is covering it but I still had to pay my deductible. The guy I got in an accident with was sending me threatening text messages until i had the cops give him a call. Just so many sucky things.

asktransgender,3e1z6x,MissDaisy9001,10,Tue Jul 21 14:49:46 2015 UTC,"Being in health care, I want to say you should always disclose. You may not think it's relevant, but there can be gender-related risk factors you're unaware of, or contraindications with your HRT meds (spironolactone screws with your potassium levels, for instance).  But, I know health care workers are still human and not always as professional as they should be. Ideally, your care would be better for them knowing your complete medical history, but I suppose in reality it's a judgment call."
asktransgender,3e1z6x,8675Thr,12,Tue Jul 21 14:06:37 2015 UTC,"One danger with this however is that some medical professional might think they're doing the right thing, but actually give you the wrong dosage because they think they're giving it for the ""right"" gender.  A lot, probably the majority of the difference between male and female medicine interactions come down to hormones. Hormone therapy causes a massive change in fundamental biochemistry. Here's a copy and paste from something I gathered earlier:  Here's a study on the effects on HRT on uric acid: http://press.endocrine.org/doi/abs/10.1210/jc.2007-2467  Women generally have lower levels of uric acid in their urine than males. When on HRT for a long period of time, trans women show a marked decline from male levels to female levels.  How about pain? There are marked differences in pain thresholds and tolerances based on sex. This study found hormone therapy to have a dramatic effect on this: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304395907000723  Here's a study of trans women on arterial reactivity: http://content.onlinejacc.org/article.aspx?articleid=1121741  Again, an effect that shows strong differences between the sexes, and when trans women are on estrogen, they switch from a male-typical to female-typical pattern.  Here's hormone therapy producing large changes in serum lipid profiles: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02311.x/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=  Here's a reversal of the sex pattern in serum leptin levels: http://press.endocrine.org/doi/abs/10.1210/jcem.82.10.4284  Here, hormone therapy is shown to induce large changes in bone metabolism and serum insulin-like growth factor-1: http://press.endocrine.org/doi/abs/10.1210/jcem.81.6.8964856  Here large changes are seen in fat cell size and in vitro lipolytic activity of abdominal and gluteal adipocytes: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026049599901464  This study found plasma total homocysteine levels to switch from male-typical to female-typical levels in trans women, and the opposite in trans men. http://press.endocrine.org/doi/abs/10.1210/jcem.83.2.4574  Here's a study looking at body fat distribution: http://ajpendo.physiology.org/content/276/2/E317.short  Etc. The literature clearly shows that there is a massive, fundamental biochemical change, at the cellular level for transgender people on hormone therapy. Most of the biological medical differences between the sexes, (apart from obvious exceptions like reproductive organs), come down to hormones, not genetics. This is why HRT produces such dramatic and profound effects on fundamental biochemistry.  This is one of the things I worry about most when outing myself to a medical professional. There's a lot of ignorance out there, and a lot of people, even medical professionals, think trans people do nothing more than get SRS and breast implants. If I out myself, there's a good chance that some ignorant doc will say, ""oh, isleepinahammock is really biologically male. I'll give her the male dose.""  By doing so, said doc could kill me."

I've noticed I was more prone to complain when I got hurt, and it seemed to feel stronger, but I wasn't sure if I was imagining it. Since starting HRT that is.   Also I've noticed when using a particular drug that my libido is incredible boosted after partaking, where as before HRT it was not. The drug in questions is known to boost the female libido. So seems it has a big impact on sex drive, not just in intensity, and frequency as people report. But also in how other drugs interact with it. At least from my limited experience."

Likewise when I had my appendix out at very short notice, I let them know about my past, so they knew what they would find in there."

They thought the one with my new name and the wrong gender had just been a filing mistake.

There was a huge difference in the way I was treated by staff who took exception to my status, and those who didn't care, or who knew other trans people.    The worst part about prejudice in the healthcare system is that patients are entirely vulnerable, often at the complete mercy of the medical professionals in charge of patient care, and the transphobic staff can make one's life a living hell.

I confess I do too. You have to understand that many of us get in the field to see interesting stuff. It might be a bit dehumanizing to be the source of such curiosity but you're making the day of said doctor/medstudent/nurse who are tired of dealing with booboos and bulllshit. Nowadays the subject of transgendered people is now gaining a spotlight of attention whilst everyone is still unfamiliar with it. In 20 years when our generations and the previous ones have paved the way for all the future transgendered souls to come, nobody in the same hospital will bat an eye when you tell them you're transgendered."

I personally think that is crossing a professional boundary."
asktransgender,3e1z6x,arkwald,14,Tue Jul 21 11:18:37 2015 UTC,I must disagree. Only through full disclosure can we be integrated.  I have rather unique genetic quirks that followed me into transition. I am still examined whenever I go in by students.  It's very obvious in public the genetic flaw and abnormalities I have.  It's a curiosity and I allow anyone to understand it.
asktransgender,3e1z6x,Bacilli,3,Tue Jul 21 16:42:56 2015 UTC,"Well all those medical students that are probably frequenting your room are there to learn. And to a certain extent your doctors and nurses too. If a person never interacts with a transgendered person then they'll never know how to act. Medicine is a learning process of trial and error. I learnt how to put an IV in when I physically did it on a patient. Books can only reach us so much. And it is the same for the topic of transgendered persons. A med school textbook will barely scrape the topic as medicine is such a broad topic. When I went through medic school it didn't even address transgendered health. We as providers learn by interacting with our patients which at the end of the day makes us better providers. We make mistakes, we might offend someone or do a procedure wrong. The only way we rectify that is through trying. The people who were annoying you at the hospital will probably go home today and over a glass (or bottle) of wine think over what they did wrong in their conversation with you and tomorrow when they meet their next transgendered patent will act better. That first IV I mentioned earlier was preceded by many failed attempts. Take it with a grain of salt and take solace in the fact that you are training the next generation of medical personnel to be so much better for us all here."
asktransgender,3e1z6x,BostonTentacleParty,6,Tue Jul 21 12:00:04 2015 UTC,"You also need to look at it from the patients point of view. If I'm in a hospital, I'm there to relieve medical treatment so that I can recover in the shortest possible time. When people are just sticking their nose in because they want to be nosey, or if they use the information to make you uncomfortable, that is crossing a professional boundary.  As for medical students, they are a different kettle of fish, and I have worked with students in the past, as part of their studies. The case is very different when I'm in need of medical care, and I have a right to receive that medical care regardless of my past."
asktransgender,3e1z6x,Bacilli,2,Tue Jul 21 12:07:12 2015 UTC,"No I get it. I've been in those shoes too. And whilst I may not believe that curiosity is a bad thing, you might. However if every physician or nurse didn't venture to become familiar with the unfamiliar then your GP would still be using leaches as preventative medicine. It sucks but we need to learn in order for the advancement of this profession. If it's a big deal to you then convey it to us. Because how else would we know we're crossing a boundary if we did not try and find out. Most medical professionals would not be offended by you confronting them and would try to address the issue. Like I said, we were never taught how to deal with the trans demographic in school."
asktransgender,3e1z6x,BostonTentacleParty,2,Tue Jul 21 12:20:51 2015 UTC,"I guess you skipped the day in school too where leaches are still used, and with very good results too. :-)  Curios has a time and place. When someone presents needed medical attention, and you postpone that for your own wants, you are not acting in a professional manner. Then going on and treating a patient differently because you didn't get what you want, is not only childish, it's against the very grain of your training."

Treating a person differently or delaying expedient care is a different matter. It's unprofessional and unbecoming of those of us in this field. Although I don't want to admit that our field has plenty of people that are dirtbags/burnt-out or both, we have plenty of those people. And whilst curiosity has its place, if these people we're intenetonally delaying your care then that is a different matter all together."

Why are they on there?  I would like to add though that some people don't mind a doctor or nurse being curious about themselves and teaching and should the doctor or nurse about the thing that's different that interests the doctor or nurse. It's ok for the doctor or nurse to be interested but once the patient has said no and doesn't want to entertain the questions or entertain their curiosity, the patient should not have to. You are right it is great if the patient wants to teach the doctor or nurse so they can have knowledge of it from expiernce but it shouldn't be the patient's job to answer their questions or entertain their curiosity if they don't want to do this."
asktransgender,3e1z6x,Bacilli,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:26:30 2015 UTC,"I understand your point as I'm pre-med and have many med school friends and doctors, but it comes down to it, transgender individuals are by no means obligated to sacrifice our privacy for others education.  They way you talk about the issues makes it seem to me like you believe that transgender people have a moral obligation to endure the discomfort for the benefit of the medical community. This is not the case. While textbook and education is lacking, there are plenty of resources if someone really wants to be educated. Textbooks, conferences, guides, forums like these. An individual who is seeking medical treatment is not one of these sources. There is a right to be treated professionally and privately in the healthcare world.   Just because people don't understand us, we are not obligated in any way, shape or form to provide that education to them. People should educate themselves; particularly if it connected to their jobs of saving lives"

For instance, it would be hard to be enrolled in 3 different doctorate programs at the same time. Stepping away from that kind of example though, the question becomes to what level of knowledge is acceptable? What should be the appropriate standard of care?   As I myself am not a medical professional, I am not entirely sure just what level any given profession needs to be aware of. However,  I presume there is a pre-existing distribution for other conditions and drugs. In comparison to that, I would presume those standards of transgender care would be an addendum. In turn, that would dictate just how much effort it would take to dispel any ignorance. Perhaps, that is a short workshop. Perhaps that would be a more involved remediation. As I indicated before, as I am not a medical professional I have little idea of the implications to that sort of training."

No. Like every aspect of medicine there are boundaries and if a person states they don't want, then their word is law. However the vibe I was getting is that we should strictly go to SJW mode and never be inquisitive about transgendered people lest we offend.   Now my post is going to devolve less from the argument at hand and to bitter griping from a Paramedic (not intending to cause offense). You as a Med student have access to a vest plethora of knowledge and professors to whom you can get advise. As a Paramedic I get paid scraps to provide emergency medicine. I could never afford time or money to attend conferences or buy books, attend classes, etc. on transgendered medicine. And of the thousands of Pts I have treated I have encountered a transgendered pt once. If I was not transgendered I would have had zero knowledge or an idea how to approach a dialogue. And you'll find thousands of of doctors and nurses who never have delt with a transgendered person. It's my sincere hope that your generation of new doctors/nurses/medics will be thrust out of school with a lot more knowledge than us currently in the field.

asktransgender,3e2ey5,Amy_of_Dallas,5,Tue Jul 21 12:58:48 2015 UTC,"There are some things in life that just cannot be done yet. It sounds like you're in quite a bit of a hard place, and I feel for you. But what you have now is what you have, so make the best of it. If you want to be an adult-sized kid, then be one! I know many people who do this regardless of their childhood because it's who they are.   If you ever discover true happiness, you're up there with Gandhi, Mother Teresa, ect. Very few of us ever make it there, so get as close as you damn can and you've passed billions of people in the process. It may not be perfect or ideal, but it is better than living in a self-wallow that you honestly believe is what life is going to be like forever.   To follow that tangent, some of my friends who are/were suicidal are some of the kindest people I know, so I encouraged them to not have their life be about them, but to do what they can to help others. Every single time, they feel like their life has value and that they are making a difference in the world. Some of the things they do are; donate blood, organs and time to medical research and transplants; become some of the greatest volunteer directors in their community; be professional suicide counselors and therapists; list goes on.  My point is that just because there are some things in your life that you cannot have or  be, does not mean that you are any less valuable. The only thing that dictates that is what you do given your circumstances. So one thing you could consider now is instead of longing for what you could have had, try becoming a GID counselor and helping others to make their decision and make it through their transition."

I'll always be wide-shouldered + man-faced + 6'1. I'll never get rid of my anger and resentment. It won't get better.  You said you aren't detransitioning and I respect that choice. In many ways, it's the more difficult choice. I stopped hormones around 2 months ago, and I've now resigned to living my life as a dude. It's less painful than trying to transition but never measuring up to cis women. I'm still taking small amounts of Androcur and Finasteride so that I don't go bald though. But otherwise, I'll be ""just another dude""."

You will likely end up at a point in your life where you have spent more years presenting female than male, people who transition in their 50 most likely won't. What do you feel like you can do now that you couldn't when you were living someone else's version of the life you want to live?  Another thing that helps me a lot is staying in touch with and helping new transitioners. Seeing the joy in their lives as they finally get to be themselves reminds me of where I was and how far I've come, and makes me feel lucky to have been able to.  Even if it's not as far as I'd like it's still miles ahead of where I'd be had I never stumbled upon whatever thing it was online that finally helped me break down the psychological walls that had forcibly closed off an entire aspect of my self."

asktransgender,3e2ey5,Ivybridge80,2,Tue Jul 21 18:01:26 2015 UTC,"i started transition almost exactly when you did, and i am almost exactly your age as well (~29.5). you may have seen me around here before. i feel your pain.. when i watch youtube videos from young trans girls i feel very happy for them but i also can't help but mourn the experiences that i missed. i also knew from a very young age that i was trans but didn't have the ""courage"" to come out.. and i sometimes beat myself up about it.  one thing that helps alleviate the feeling that it's my fault for being a coward and not transitioning earlier is the knowledge that this isn't really true. it's not true because i grew up in a transphobic home in a transphobic town in a transphobic time full of transphobic media and transphobic information. i was a child and i didn't know any better, and thus it was impossible for me to see transition as a realistic and viable option. i just didn't want to be completely abandoned and/or bullied to death. self-preservation is not cowardice, especially in children, it's natural.  i also know that while i didn't experience my ideal childhood and young adulthood, i did get to experience male life first hand so that i can better appreciate and understand the differences between men and women. i met some interesting people and was in some interesting situations that wouldn't have been possible if i was a girl or young woman. while not all of it was positive, my life experiences were certainly enriched and i have a lot more perspective than most people do. i know who i am, and i know how i want to live my life now, and i have the courage to do that; that's a lot more than most people can say for themselves.  of course, when i'm really feeling down, not much of anything but xanax and weed numbs me enough to settle me down. but please know that you're not alone, and that it's not your fault, and that you're not a coward. our lot in life is not easy, but it's absolutely NOT our fault that we ended up this way - it's a miracle that despite all the suffering we endured as children, we somehow found the courage to be true to ourselves."

It's probably part of the reason why I avoided asking myself if I was trans for so long - because I used to wish that in my next life, I'd be a girl.  Now, I'm agnostic. I don't know if there's another go-round awaiting me after this one, or an afterlife of any sort. All I can do is trust in what I see and feel. And knowing that... there's a chance that this is the only go-round I'll get. And if that's the case... then there's no sense lamenting what I can't change, and I might as well take the leap, and do what I can to make my dreams as much a reality as possible, right here, right now.  This is, in a lot of ways, the line of self-reflection that led me to finally admit I could be trans - to research it, to seek counseling, and to start on my journey. Perhaps I'll never be a teenage girl, and I'll never have a high school romance, and all that... but I still have people who love and care about me, who support me, and who want to see me become the person I'm meant to be.

Some of the stuff on this list isn't changeable since we don't have time travel. However, you can at least partially fix the physical stuff you're listing: small and cute, hips, gait, etc. I'm going to be blunt: from the pictures you have posted you are significantly overweight. If you eat healthy and get plenty of exercise you can slim down and get to a healthy weight. It is hard work but it is doable. I've done it myself, I used to weigh about 300 lbs and I'm now maintaining at 170. If you get in shape you may be pleasantly surprised by your figure. It will help emphasize your bust and hips and your gait will improve. You will be smaller and cuter. And as a bonus you will feel better both physically and mentally. Also, once you slim down you can start doing targeted weight training to put on muscle strategically to augment desired curves, which is something I'm working on now.  If you need help getting started I've found a number of really helpful subreddits: fitness, xxfitness, fitmeals, and lose it for starters. I'm also happy to provide some beginners advice if you are interested. We may not have time travel but you CAN be happier with your body. It's hard work but you're already doing one of the hardest things someone can do: gender transition. You know how to make positive changes in your life so you can do this too if you put your mind to it."

asktransgender,3e0dd7,TurquoiseMouse,39,Tue Jul 21 17:30:35 2015 UTC,"I say be honest with them: you met a girl that you like.  You can't speak to who she was, but you like being with who she is.  You don't feel that your love life is their business, but you really think this girl is something special.   A lot of women have health complications; would they support you if your girlfriend had a hysterectomy?  You would hope that they could stand by and support you, but if they can't, they should know that you still love and support them.    I'm thinking of other things, but I keep editing it back down to this.  I think it's important to understand that at their core, your parents are concerned for you.  I'm not saying the concern is valid or that this isn't insensitive.  It isn't any of their business, but hopefully they will support you and your girlfriend going forward."
asktransgender,3e0dd7,CKL2014,33,Tue Jul 21 00:23:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks. That means a lot.  It really bothered me that my mom's first statements were:  1. to tell me she cried when she found out.  2. To ask me if I was gay/when I became gay (I'm not. I'm attracted to women. I've no issue with gay people but I'm bothered that she automatically lumped me into a category) 3. To ask if girlfriend has a penis. I answered ""why does that matter, that's a very personal and private question."" she said ""it just does."""

Where your previous relations genitals a usual topic of conversation?  Personally I'd just bounce these questions back,    ""Her genitals is not a topic for public discussion."" ""Why?""

I think you're pretty awesome for caring as much as you do. Dating a trans person unfortunately does bring with it some amount of stress. Because of your relationship, you'll be dealing with some of the same transphobia that she does.   If she's strong enough to deal with it, the two of you should certainly be strong enough to deal with it. Don't let other peoples opinions affect a real connection with someone. Your relationship doesn't affect their lives, and hopefully you can minimize the effect they have on yours.   Sometimes all people need to understand that trans people are just people trying to be happy, is to have an experience with us."

asktransgender,3e0dd7,Alyssa_B,14,Tue Jul 21 03:11:14 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm a 27 year old trans woman. I too grew up in a conservative christian household. Believe me, I understand what you and your girlfriend are experiencing. I'm sorry that you two have to go through this.  I'll start by saying that, unfortunately, some people put their religion or theology or worldview above other people, including their own family. Only you can say if your parents are like this. Have they ever talked to you about LGBT issues prior to this?  Their reaction is troubling. First of all, being in a relationship with a trans woman does not make you gay. They may not listen to reason however. Secondly, it's none of their business. You and your girlfriend are in this relationship, not your parents. You have every right to date whomever you wish, and disclose or not disclose any information.  I suggest either sitting them down and telling them in no uncertain terms what you told us - that you arent going to abandon her just because of superficial bullshit.  But in the end, it's not up to you whether your relationship with your parents will continue to be valued. It's up to them to come to terms with a real-life situation with real-life people, and accept you and her.  My suggestion is to talk with your girlfriend. Protect her and make sure she knows that even though your family may be ignorant, that you are not. Remember that however you feel, she feels or has felt it too, likely to a larger degree."

asktransgender,3e0dd7,Alyssa_B,13,Tue Jul 21 13:54:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think you have anything to worry about when it comes to your job. Employers don't care who you date if you turn up to work on time and do what you are supposed to do, unless you are working for a religious organisation.  Wow at your mother's homophobia, and thinking it is her business whether you sleep with someone who has a penis and making some value judgement about you based on that. I honestly don't know how she can say things like that and not be self-aware that she is doing the wrong thing by saying them. I think I would just point out that she is acting very homophobic and that she is asking you to tell her about someone else's genitals like she has a right to know what they are like, and that she didn't raise you to be hateful or to disrespect someone's privacy like that.   Both my parents have both attempted at different points in my life to get histrionic about homosexuality. I was gay before transition and lesbian after (during transition people's scent changed and what used to turn me off turned me on and vice versa). I dealt with it by basically telling them I wasn't going to be happy alone or with someone I wasn't attracted to, and they are not a substitute for a partner. Even if they were, they would die 20 years before me and I would then be alone for all that time. So I told them if they made me choose, I chose my sexuality over them, and they would lose me. You've got to have boundaries and a sense of who you are. Partners have to come first. I wouldn't say that after dating for 2 weeks but if you think you won't end up in a cis hetero relationship eventually then taking a stand on this takes care of any future issues they might have with future partners too.  My parents just visited last weekend with a bunch of baby stuff for me and my lesbian girlfriend - she's having a baby through IVF and I'm going to be the second parent on the birth certificate. The baby isn't linked to me by blood yet my parents are over the moon about their new grandchild. So it all worked out. I'm sure a lot of times it doesn't but at the end of the day my partner is who supports me in life now, not my parents."

What's right is to tell your parents that you're an adult, they may not believe in or agree with all of your decisions in life but you love them all the same, you hope they will still love you and to move on.

You said shes your girlfriend, do you have real feelings for her?  Think about what you're facing right now: loss of family respect, loss of friends, risk to your personal life and professional life. That's pretty scary right?  The reason I ask is because this girl you're dating has faced all of this, and probably much worse. Some of it she has to face on a daily basis.   I'm saying that if you truly care about her, and want to be with her, then you better gear up for what may (or may not) come.   I get that you're worried about your job, your friends, your family. That's perfectly valid and understandable. But if you try to be her boyfriend and don't go all in, balls to the wall, then you're going to hurt her. Because trust me, she will know when youre afraid to introduce her to friends and family, she will know when she's being hidden, she will know when you're afraid to be seen with her.  Its totally up to you to weigh it out. A trans woman you have feelings for enough to call your girlfriend, the worst thing shes doing in this sitauation is being her beautiful authentic self....or your family and friend's closeminded beliefs that they feel are more important than your happiness.  Like I said, I dont mean to be rude or offensive, just saying what's on my heart after reading your post. You seem like a sweet guy, and Im sure she is lucky to have you.

asktransgender,3e0dd7,barrelmutt,7,Tue Jul 21 13:56:48 2015 UTC,"""She then called my parents. They are upset, asked me when I became gay.""    UGH. You cannot be gay from dating a trans woman. You have to be attracted to some level of masculinity (mentally, emotionally and physically) to be attracted to men.    I'm pretty sure you're dating her because you see a woman, not a man. Being Man or Woman is just so much deeper than physical sex.    An analogy I like to use is to imagine two computers next to each other. One contains an AI operating system that self-identifies as female, and the other self-identifies as male. Both computers have casing and hardware that serve a basic function, but these things do not define or determine the gender of the AI OS.    It's no different than the human being. The body is just our casing in the form of ""male"" and ""female"" biology for the purpose of reproduction and pleasure, and our operating system is our conscious awareness of Self within the brain (hard drive).    Try to explain this to them in a way they can understand. I think it's pretty cut and dried. Watch the film HER. Here's the trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzV6mXIOVl4"
asktransgender,3e0dd7,boisegang,3,Tue Jul 21 01:18:11 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that my recurring relationship failures had a lot to do with not being the man they thought they were dating no matter if I was aware of that issue fully. You can't hide who you are no matter what façade you're living, consciously or unconsciously. They were unwittingly dating a woman, and that's not going to provide the right kind of chemistry when you're a straight cis woman.  I dated a cis lesbian back in March/April, and we had a chemistry that I've never felt before. She saw the real me, not the non-passing body I carry around. I always felt awkward and uncertain in past relationships, but I didn't feel that way with her. Sadly, she dumped me for something stupid, but it had nothing to do with how we clicked overall.  Male body or not, our relationship was totally gay (in the good way)! Only some irritating TERF would have said otherwise."

She then called my parents.    Jesus. Christ. Defriend her immediately and cut her from your life.   ...and I don't want to be viewed in a poor light.   You don't control what they think or feel; they do. Are you an adult, and act on your own volition, or must your parents and aunt vet your partners?  Serious question here; what if your girl was of a different race? Twenty years your senior? How far are you willing to grovel for their approval?   ...but I don't get out of this one without hurting someone that I care about.   Again, you're not hurting your parents. But I promise you if you tell your girl you can no longer see her, she'll be deeply hurt and think you weak.  And she'll be right.  As for your job - I'm not sure what you do; is this a valid concern? I've never worked a job where what I did off company property or who I dated was a factor in promotions or continued employment.  Personally, I'd continue seeing whomever I pleased and not even argue with the parents; nod, acknowledge their concerns and change the subject; if they continue to harp on it, get up and leave or politely cut the call short.  And me, personally, not that you should - but I'd mess up that Aunt's world. I'd research, plan, and put some torpedoes in her; when creatures like her are dealing with their own world afire, they have no time to screw with others."

I was so terrified to tell her. She was the first person to whom I'd confided that I had gender identity issues, before I had even truly admitted to myself that I am trans. She wasn't the most understanding at first - having never been really exposed to transgender topics before, but she wanted to make sure I was happy and healthy. That was six months ago, and she's loving the changes HRT has been bringing me. She's loving the way I express myself now and how positively alive I am.   So it wasn't the most surprising, I knew she'd love me no matter what, but it was the biggest contrast from being petrified to feeling so much love.  On a separate note, I was also afraid to come out to my father. He's not especially conservative or anything - but it's worth noting he is cheap. Like, ""let's go out tonight... I have a coupon to Wendy's"" kind of cheap. So I came out to my mother, and she asked me if I'd like her to speak to my father. I said yes...

I guess I was worried a little. Despite being 26 I'm still not ready to be completely separated from them - not just emotionally - so I was worried there, but I knew that they would come to accept me - turns out there was absolutely no problem on that front. I guess I'm lucky."

asktransgender,3e1yj0,barrelmutt,7,Tue Jul 21 14:27:16 2015 UTC,"I was most worried about my mother. I thought she'd think it was a phase or just because I hated my body or something. We talked until like 4 am and though it took her a bit to fully wrap her head around it all (she was using offensive terms and phrases and actually got mad at me one time in a conversation about phallo) she's probably the most supportive person I have in my life.  Another one was probably my boyfriend. This was when me and him were just friends and we had started talking and I had finally kinda come out but not uber officially (if someone I asked about it I'd confirm it, and my friend group knew, but I didn't make a long post about it and stuff) and I corrected him on pronouns and he said ""alright cool, I'll make a reminder"". Considering at this time I didn't know him uber well and my initial reaction he was a 2edgy4me 4channer so I assumed he'd probably throw a slur or two at me and ask a bunch of questions but he was uber chill about it"
asktransgender,3e1yj0,illuminess,7,Tue Jul 21 09:45:36 2015 UTC,"I knew that my mother would be supportive right away. When I came out to her she didn't even flinch. She just basically alluded that it made sense and that she loved me and supported me.    My dad has a history in the LGBT community as a bar tender, so it doesn't bother him. He recently called me his daughter, too. :)    My grandmother was initially upset and said she didn't approve, but I've since educated her on everything. She's taken me to my endo appointments and to pick up prescriptions. She doesn't like to talk about it, though, as she hasn't responded much to the emails I sent on trans issues.    Overall, I've been pretty lucky. I think one friend of mine has distanced himself, but he's also a touring musician. It's hard to tell. So far, though, I've had no outright rejections."

Mum said she doesn't care ""if I cut the wood in a frilly tutu and heels"" she will always love and support me as long as I am happy and safe what ever I do.

In all three forums the thread became the most liked thread ever. And I haven't received any hate or dismissive messages.   That was a huge surprise to me and still amazes me today.

They didn't surprise me that they were accepting; one is gay and has a lot of MTF friends and drag queen friends, and another is queer. Of course they'd be accepting. But what I didn't expect was how immediate their support was. There was literally no hint of surprise or anything, it was just immediate support, and they've never used the wrong name/pronouns, which is weird because even I've misgendered myself.  And pretty much everyone minus my family. I came out to most people on Facebook for the sake of convenience, and it was great how many of my family members told me they're happy as long as I'm happy (they still misgender me, but at the time that was nice), friends, acquaintances, etc. Literally not a single negative comment.  Lastly, this girl I went to school with. She bullied me the first couple of years, but then left me alone. We're not friends, but we're amicable and we speak now and again. She's a devout Muslim now, so when she commented giving me a lot of support and complimenting my bravery, it was very cool. I don't tend to judge people, but as a rule, if you're always posting quotes from a holy book and whatnot, I'm going to be unsure about whether you're accepting or not."

She treated me like a slave essentially, she was unwell but she wouldn't even call me by my name. She apologises over and over for it but it was 18 years worth of effort she never gave for me, meanwhile she put in tonnes of effort for my siblings.  She and my dad divorced and she moved away to another country and remarried, we started talking more after she left, albeit still not a lot, and I decided I'd tell her I was trans before I told my dad because I knew my dad would take it badly and I needed to tell somebody. She responded with ""Oh... Is that why you've been so happy when you've gone on holiday recently? You've been living in Edinburgh as a girl? I always thought you might've been trans. It's about time you figured out who you are.""  So yea, essentially the last person who I would've thought to have an idea about who I am was the only one in my family to not be surprised by it, and she even expected it? She's far more supportive than my dad too she gets the name and pronouns right and never mixes them up, although only speaking through skype text probably helps that... dad never gets it right."

The two biggest surprises: One from my best friends roommate from college.  He was a cool guy, though can be opinionated.  When I came out to him, a few days later I got an essay about how awesome it was and how me coming out made him happy.  He and his girlfriend (another of my good friends) moved to Missouri, but his long distance support was a huge boost, and a few weekends ago they were in town and we hung out.  The other is my Supervisor at work.  So back in September, my dating profile was discovered by a gossiper and rumor started spreading.  This guy, my supervisor, just started about a month before.  I took him into the conference room and explained everything.  He was not only supportive, but has been a huge motivator and supportive person throughout the time when the rumor spread up until last Friday when I showed up to work as a woman for the first time.  His level of support has been great and I'm glad that this department I work in has been as accepting.  A few bathroom concerns, but mostly indifference or support.  The other supervisors and managers also have my back, as does HR.  So I'm just surprised by everyone!"
asktransgender,3e1yj0,DeathToBreakdowns,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:46 2015 UTC,"My abuela. She and I have never been super close, and the fact that my dad didn't really teach me spanish prevented me from being able to speak with her easily. I never spoke to her about my gender identity or anything.   After I transitioned she still liked my pictures on facebook, she called me beautiful, she got upset that I shaved off part of my super long hair (She feels like women should have long hair, I think)  But she would also still like my old pictures of me as a kid, obviously dressed masculine before I deleted them but after I had transitioned for a year.   Honestly I think my abuela doesn't care if I identify as a boy or a girl or a dinosaur. She just accepts me unconditionally and never tried to debate my gender like everyone else in my family did. That kind of unconditional familial love is refreshing.  Another story is my step dad, who unlike my biological dad, didn't really try to instill doubt in me. He was surprised but not upset. Later on he even helped me inject my first DIY hormones and was pretty good about switching to my preferred pronouns even though he's the sort who often mixes up my sisters' names."

I like guys because they're tall, or built a certain way, or have an amazing voice, etc. It's not a deal-breaker if they don't have those things, but I freaking love it if they do. If someone thinks they can parade me around as their teaching moment, they can get bent, but if they like me for my body, or because I've been on both sides of the fence, or because my voice cracks when I'm excited, then I don't care. I'm pretty much just happy to be loved."

Actually, make that nearly any statement that includes, ""Women and trans men.""   The first two heavily imply that we're never going to be real men, the third and fourth basically lump us in with women, and, while there are exceptions with the last, the only time I've seen that grouping work was in an article about domestic violence."

I'm saying that the window of people I find really attractive includes a significant subset of trans men.

I think out trans people are brave just for being who they are in a world which is still coming to grips with them. I like andro folk, I like a well tailored suit.

But not all trans men are the same; some will prefer to look feminine or androgynous while others prefer a more masculine look. In terms of bodies, some trans men will have 'female' anatomy while others may be indistinguishable from a cis man. Some trans men may be okay with their 'female' parts, but in my experience most are not.  It's great that you're thinking about this critically. I would ask yourself what specifically you're attracted to. If you're actually attracted to the guy, that's great, but I would question why it's so different from being attracted to a cis guy. If you're more attracted to the idea of a man who 'isn't really a man', that's not really a great start to a relationship."

Central family practice is almost NEVER taking clients, the person who works there is part time. They don't take insurance,  but depending on you plan most insurances won't cover anything.  Downtown doctor advertise that they see transgender people on their website, dont require a reference ( even though on their website the say they do) and will prescribe you hormones on the spot. If they ask if you seeing a counselor just say yes, they dont check. The downside is she has horrible bedside manners and will drag her feet to raise your dosage.  And the does will be REALLY low. Also she is very money hungry. Check her reviews  I currently see one of her former NP who transfered from dowtown doctor. She is incredibly nice and thoughtful and will do everything she can to make you happy. She tries to work with you even if you are on a budget. Even found me a place that does cheap labs. She knows its hard being trans and will treat you with respect.  PM me for her info, I dont like giving it out openly. She has already told me she is more than willing to see clients   Also a great place for counseling is waterloo counseling center, even have a sliding pay scale for those withou insurance  If anyone else has questions feel free to pm me :)"

You can still transition while being stealth about it for those 6 months though. Just keep your regular habits for whichever gender you're presenting now. If you're MtF, maybe buy looser-fitting shirts to minimize visible breast growth.  People that see you often won't notice the minor changes from week to week. Its when people don't see you for 6 months at a time that they notice the sudden differences.  If I were you, I'd start now. Starting HRT earlier in your life is always best."

So don't worry about whether it's a relationship that could last 2-3 years, you're not there yet. A better question - do you want to go on a date with him? Where would you want to go? Will you be able to handle that, like you when you first met him, some people you interact with on that date may also not be sure that he's a boy?  -as for the foreigner thing, you won't know till you ask.

You could mention that you didn't know how to bring this up if you want to talk about the cultural/language stuff at the same time. Maybe that's too complicated?

Ask them about sliding-scale fees if you're concerned about the cost. They may be a whole lot more affordable than you think.

If you think any of the above is true, don't do it.  Hormones: Hormones are for life, not just transition. Yes, it is possible to not take them, but your body doesn't produce any testosterone or estrogen naturally, so it can lead to a lot of different health complications. Stopping them won't change everything back, but it certainly isn't recommended.  Clothes: Unless you only wear clothes once, before throwing them away, you'll get your membership card withdrawn from TransClub. Think of all that free validated parking you're going to miss out on! Seriously though, change your clothes as often as you like, there's no rules there.  Face Surgery: You may need it, you may not. The changes to your face take about five years to really take affect. There is no rule that you have to have it done.  Gender surgery: No rule as to when you have to have it, or even if you have to have it. It's your body. If you were to have it done as soon as possible, my suggestion would be to have a plan for life after it. If you ""rushed"" with surgery being your only focus it can become the only thing you think about in your life, and then when it's done, you can be left wondering ""what next?"", and doubt why you because so consumed with having it done. Surgery is an optional part of life, not something that must happen to justify who you are.

Regardless of what you want to achieve, never be blindsided by the end goal.

Pills/injections/patches is also pretty much whatever you want, can get, and works for you.   Any surgeries you want are up to you and whether or not you can afford them.

As for actually diagnosed disorders...my ADHD has become worse it seems like. My mood swings and emotional outbursts are much harder to control. Anxiety has actually gotten better, but there could be other reasons.

After a few months I tried going off my depression meds; things were fine for a while, but after a few months started getting worse (which is on schedule for terminating SSRIs, SNRIs, and similar). The post-HRT depression is extremely mild compared to what I was used to, but still worth being on meds for.  I also have cPTSD. Over decades of therapy I basically managed to deal with everything, so it wasn't too much of an issue immediately pre-HRT. A while after starting HRT, about a year say, a Thing(tm) happened and I had a major crack and everything came flooding back. I wouldn't really say it was HRT-induced; rather, I'd say the effects of HRT on my emotions (i.e., lifting the foggy veil of T) had a knock-on effect of uncovering some deep-seated issues I'd never really dealt with. Or maybe it just had more to do with finally transitioning and allowing myself to think about some things I'd been keeping myself from thinking about. Plus there was the Thing(tm).  There are a lot of folks here with MI. Some improved after transitioning; others not. It's just one of those things. HRT isn't a panacea."

I was hopeful that transition would fix it, however, I did really know, not even that deep down that it would not.

asktransgender,3e13q5,Chryssie,2,Tue Jul 21 08:24:35 2015 UTC,"That webcomic is so freaking relatable.   I was severely depressed for a long time, starting when I was 14-ish, I think. I was never diagnosed or really told anyone about it, but I had suicidal thoughts on the regular. It was bad. I've been on HRT for a bit over 11 months, and I've clearly changed a lot in that regard. I'm generally a much happier person overall, and I feel like I'm able to function a lot better. I've had some bad days, hell some really, really, really bad days since transitioning, but overall, I've definitely improved in terms of my mood."
asktransgender,3e13q5,heavymetaljew,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:01:41 2015 UTC,"I've struggled with depression pretty much since puberty. Started cutting in high school. In and out of therapy with no real results. Hospitalized once for a depressive episode where I used cigarettes to burn a line of circles down my arm while at work (I was working as a case manager for mentally ill adults at the time, talk about the blind leading the blind). Serious suicide attempt earlier that same year (2006), which by all accounts should have been successful, but I got lucky I guess. Went through a phase in 2008-2010 when I was getting drunk a lot (by anyone else's standards, it wasn't much, but it was worrisome to me because it was obviously a coping mechanism). Things had been better for the last 5 years, because I finally got into a relationship with the love of my life. From 5 years ago to about 4-5 months ago, our sex life got worse and I became slowly more withdrawn. Around 4-5 months ago I pretty much had given up on sex and was spending all of my non working time playing video games so I wouldn't have to think about how terrible I was feeling.   I came out as trans in April, and started HRT that same month. The difference in my mood is night and day. Now I have confidence. I no longer feel that sense of malaise all the time. I'm less cynical, and more hopeful. I am able to cope with changes in my life and deal with stressors more effectively. The only severe negative experiences I have had since starting HRT have been a handful of body dysphoric events, which I am in therapy for to figure out how to deal with.   HRT has saved my life, no question. I will be proudly and openly trans until the day I die if it means I can help someone else overcome their struggles towards realizing who they are."

Being trans, or I guess having gender dysphoria - but also being trans - has put a lot of strain on my life. Combined with depression and whatever else I have, I've become rather useless and unmotivated. It's been a matter of ""Can I have surgery now? Can I treat the underlying cause of all of this yet? No? Then why f**king bother?""  Things have improved ever since I started on meds, but I still don't see myself living past 30-40 or so if things keep up this way."

asktransgender,3e23od,zordanius,4,Tue Jul 21 10:51:37 2015 UTC,"I was very scared when I started to ask myself if I needed to transition. I knew it would be hard, scary, and depressing. I tried to convince myself that I did not need it, that I could manage. I'd expressed myself as male for 20 years, how bad could it be?  But then it kept eating away at me, as it already had been slowly the past nine years. I asked myself if I would prefer to transition later, five, maybe ten years? I think then, I realized, this was a real medical necessity. But some people can manage their dysphoria better, and for some transition may not be a necessity. I think the best thing is to try to move in a direction of expression, and see how it feels. It might not be all nice, but you'll find things you like, and maybe not transitioning, but impacting the way you express yourself - to where you're comfortable, and happy."

asktransgender,3e23od,justansweringthis1,2,Tue Jul 21 11:46:43 2015 UTC,"As far as I remember ""I"" has always been female, even with a male body, but I had no knowledge that there was any way to address that at all. No hormones or anything, just stuck. It was something I thought of so much(even to the point of often thinking about the likelihood of reincarnation by suicide).  And then earlier this year I spoke with someone on the other side who mentioned transitioning, and I was suddenly like ""Oh, is that a thing?"" And it's something I want and think about and fall asleep thinking about and wake up thinking about.  I don't have the foggiest clue about how to be like males or masculine. It's not something that comes naturally. What little I know of acting was just enough to reduce the immense social problems I had growing up.  I'm 32 years old. I am doing everything possible to try to make sure that I can do this and live. I would accept losing my family if necessary. Even though I love them and care about them, this is something very important.  My major concern is employment. I need to be able to have the money for my living expenses(and to pay for whatever related things need to be paid for). That is my major concern right now. I don't think children are for me. I like kids, just don't feel a need for my own.  But no, I don't have two spirits, just one, who does not want to play around and pretend to be male one moment more."

So I made my first appointment yesterday. This is the farthest I've come since I felt these feelings as an adult. I'm terrified but I feel so much better than I did.

Btw I like what i saw in the mirror. I am just 5.4 feet / 165 cm so my body height is good.. at least something good ;) In germany it is not the easy to start HRT. I read about that you have to do a test an daily basis. Maybe going out as a woman and living life as a woman for a short amount of time. I would prefere to do it in stealth get feminine and then start to planing my coming out."
asktransgender,3e14g1,Atroxian,4,Tue Jul 21 03:46:35 2015 UTC,"I am a guy in early transition, and have kind of gone through the same thinking, so maybe I can offer a perspective. Firstly, if you don't think transition is right for you, then don't do it. It's a taxing process in so many ways, and if you don't think the rewards outweigh the costs, that's your call. But even if you can't picture yourself at the end of it with your ideal, perfect result, that doesn't mean you can't feel a whole ton better than you do now. Moreover, I think many peoples ""ideal end points"" shift as they transition and gain perspective, so what initially would have been a deal breaker ceases to be such a huge deal. Like, I have heard of people getting on T and experiencing reduced bottom dysphoria, just by having the right hormones.  Reading what you have written about bottom surgery, I think you may have been exposed to some misinformation. Like, yeah, we don't have the same option for genitals indistinguishable from their cis counterparts, but that doesn't mean that the procedures available are worthless, and produce results that nobody would want. There are countless people whose own genitals are the result of metas and phallos, and the vast majority of them are way happier with these results than with what they had before.  Metas can result in a completely functional, sensitive, self erecting penis. Sure, you wouldn't be hung like a horse, but think of all the physical experiences that even a tiny phallus would make possible. Being able to receive a traditional ""blow job"", being able to physically relate to penetrating ( even if it isn't physically feasible), and standing to pee without aid, to name a few. Not to mention, there are cis men born with micro-penises. I can imagine thinking about it as a very good ""excuse"" for having a micro penis, really.   As for phalloplasty, I think misinformation is really rampant online and it leads a lot of trans men to straight rule it out as an option, unless they truly need to have a more conventional phallus (I am beginning to think that this may be me, so I have done more reading on this procedure). Sure, there is a risk of lost or reduced sensation. There is a risk to any surgery. But I think the majority of patients who undergo radial forearm phalloplasty report eventually regaining full erotic sensation. Furthermore, this procedure goes in two stages, about a year apart. The glans of the penis isn't formed until stage two, meaning that for about a year, the results are not very aesthetic. People see photos of stage I phallos, and get freaked out. The healed result of stage II isn't a perfect cis penis, but it can (if you choose) be erectable, average length and girth, and honestly pretty damn good looking. People are generally very happy with their phallo results.  This was a long unsolicited info dump, but I went through a ""there is no hope that I will ever have a penis ughhhh"" thing, and realizing I was wrong was so. amazing.   Ok so info dump aside, I will try to address your actual question. I don't empathize with what you are describing, but I remember feeling it when I was still sort of questioning. Like, ""I have this perfectly fine, good lookin' girl body... why would I trade it for some not-quite cis male body?"" I can't answer that question for you, but for me the answer was ""because I am not a woman, I am a man, and I am trying to live in my body, not preserve it in the most desirable condition possible, so yeah I'm going to make it a male body"".   I still deal with the fear of never being taken ""seriously"" as male by everyone, and of being outed once I get to the point of being stealth/non-disclosing. But for me, that fear is worth being accepted by most people as male, and at least being able to know I am male and say fuck the rest. (The stealth thing I will deal with when I get there :P) I would 100% for certain never be seen as any kind of man if I didn't transition, and so really, my odds get better every day. So that's just my personal perspective on the issue you are describing.  This wound up being waaay long, I hope it at least helps you out. And I hope you are able to find a course of action that makes you feel comfortable with your self and you future!  Just an aside: I am bisexual and I know that it is pretty common for trans men to be gay. At least no less common than the cis population, maybe more common."
asktransgender,3e14g1,Destroika9,2,Tue Jul 21 05:12:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not FtM, but I do like to keep up with news and learn about their experiences too, so I think I can input here. I think phalloplasties get a very bad rep they don't really deserve. Aesthetically they usually turn out pretty damn good after the glansplasty. I found some pictures online of some completed and healed up penises here (obviously NSFW.) Honestly, having been raised as a boy and having seen a couple of penises in my time, I think they look pretty normal. It's just unfortunate that there aren't many pictures of healed up penises online - usually they're pictures of the penis before the glansplasty or right after either surgery. I think this may lead to some  misconceptions. Most of the time you get sensation back too (there is some risk - as there is with any surgery.) I'm sorry, I know less about metoidioplasties but I sure some guys will drop in with more info.  Technology is always advancing too. If you're interested in transplants a lot of exciting stuff is happening in bio-engineering. The story you mentioned is actually a massive breakthrough in surgical technique. I'd imagine transplanting a penis is an extremely difficult and complicated operation so the fact that we can do it now is very exciting. On top of that, I remember reading this last year. Essentially they're trying to 'grow' a penis using a collagen skeleton from a donor and the recipients own cells. Combine this with the surgical technique from the story you mentioned, and we got another alternative FtM bottom surgery. I wouldn't really hold out for this new stuff though. It's likely to be a few years before this sort of method would be widely available and affordable - if it ever gets there.  I can relate to having genital dysphoria though. Just hang in there. Even T alone can give results that may make you feel better, if that's what you end out doing :)"
asktransgender,3e14g1,anomine2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:56:59 2015 UTC,"You and I are in the same boat. It's going to be ok.  For now, I stick to my binders and strap-ons, and it really, really helps with my dysphoria. I, myself, am very pansexual, but I sexually and romantically have a tendency to lean towards bi or gay males.   My husband is no really big fan of my masculine-presenting in the bedroom, but I have no genital dysphoria as far as sex goes. (He is supportive of me socially and emotionally as a male, and even surprises me with male pronouns when he can tell I'm getting really depressed about my situation. My boyfriend is extremely supportive of me presenting/transitioning as a guy in and out of the bedroom, which is an amazing icing on my cake.)  Top surgery is a definite for me. Bottom surgery is still a maybe, and boosting my testosterone production is an ongoing process (I naturally create more testosterone than estrogen anyways, so I have facial/body hair to comfort me on really down days) where I'm not really sure I need a estrogen blocker. I will have my uterus and ovaries removed once I donate/freeze my latent eggs."

My response was that I've given this a lot of though and I'm no longer willing to live a lie and that he was flat out wrong. This all occurred in October 2013.  Now fast forward to now, my wife is still with me and our marriage is stronger than ever. The rest of my family ( except for 2 of his sisters ) have give me nothing but love and support. (Both parents remarried.) We didn't loose a single client and renewed a several contracts and have gained new customers. (Not really an issue with new clients since I blend/pass well.) My wife's parents also have been supportive.  I've sent several messages by E-MAIL, voicemail and even snail mail, and he never responds back. I talk with his stepdaughter who live close by to him in GA, and she says that he claims to still love me and is having an issue accepting this.

Father: ""You've fucked up your life and the life of your children, so now I have to be the dad and I had enough of that shit with you.""  It hurt because he seemed to be of the mindset that my transition meant he had a right to distance my children from me, even though it was a burden for him. There was no logic to his argument, and he wasn't willing to see any.  Mother: ""You're just doing this to hurt me. Why can't you have a heroin addiction instead, at least that is something I can deal with.""  Everything from being born, to the last time we spoke was apparently me trying to hurt my mother, and make her life worse. She projected every issue she ever had in life as being my fault somehow, simply because I exist. To add in that she would rather someone who is a junkie, to someone who is true to their own life, just shows how much of a twisted mind she has.  My sister: ""You're not welcome in my house, I don't want my children being freaked out and confused by you, and turning into faggots too.""  My sister's children were 3 and 1 at the time. It hurt that she was projecting her own hatred through her children, as though that justified her reaction as being moral and justified.   Best friend: ""I've been speaking with god and god says you should die, so I can't talk with you ever again.""  It was disappointing that someone I had been friend with since kindergarten would view me this way. To throw away a 25+ year friendship based on no fact at all was very disappointing indeed. For him to also claim to be a good Christian person all his life, yet supposedly have had this deep and meaningful conversation within 3 seconds of me telling him, was very disappointing.  The worst of all though I think, were all the friends and extended family. When told, they were full of praise and support, but then I never heard from them ever again. If I tried contacting them, my number was blocked. It was pretty clear the praise and support was only words, and paper thin ones at that."

I let myself go for a while so I'm 5'10 and 175lbs so I'd ideally be losing about 30-35lbs. That's for the next three to four months. Thanks so much for the advice!
asktransgender,3e2cos,KKae,2,Tue Jul 21 12:57:17 2015 UTC,The great thing about getting in shape its positive keeps you focused in your goal makes you feel good I dropped 50lbs my self pre hrt.  I can spend close too 150 pounds a month on a lot more when I have private appointment.  If you're organized driven and determined it makes the process so much easier my only regret is not starting laser sooner my transition had been pretty flawless including socially before hrt.
asktransgender,3e2cos,badschema,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:04:55 2015 UTC,That 300 is for 6 sessions of lip and chin which is all I need really.  Lucky in that respect.  Today's my first day back counting calories to actively lose weight so I guess today's the start of it!
asktransgender,3e2cos,Bacilli,3,Tue Jul 21 13:14:31 2015 UTC,"I'd strongly suggest exploring all your options to see if you cannot accellerate that timetable.  Your GP, for example.  Here is a scary truth that is good to know now, rather than after waiting a year: not all doctors know what the heck they are doing w/r to administering HRT.  Some fail to test hormone levels going in, and just sort of make up some doses and then 3 months later, when you're back for a checkup, don't check your hormone levels again to see if you're correctly dialed in to the right levels.  Apparently the liver risks are overstated (http://transhealth.ucsf.edu/trans?page=protocol-baseline-tests).  It'll take you less than a month to learn all the basic endocrinology and research dosing, how to get blood tests at a reasonable price, how to ensure a steady supply of drugs, etc.  Which means in a month you could be ready to hand some resources to your doctor if they aren't currently familiar enough with the HRT stuff to give them extremely good guidance on how to supervise your care, whether they are administering it themselves or you are DIYing.  I just wanted to make sure that the routes you are not doing are adequately fleshed out so that you're REALLY sure you're making the right call by going through proper channels."
asktransgender,3e2cos,Bacilli,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:02:35 2015 UTC,We'll there's actually only one facility in the country that will give the green light for hrt.  And it's part of the government's health system which is a joke anyway.  I have to have at least three sessions with two psychologists or psychiatrists. Which I totally understand its a huge thing.  But they're only accepting government payroll psychologists at the moment. The waiting times are crazy. Then they'll get me a referral for the endocrinologist.   Basically doctors can't prescribe.  It's one facility in the country that's in control of all of it.   If I can safely DIY then I'm all for it. But I'll try their way first.  Thank you so much for your advice. I'll definitely be doing my research.
asktransgender,3e2cos,tictacotictaco,2,Tue Jul 21 15:42:54 2015 UTC,"Someone on the same boat as me! I am currently living in a country where it is not socially acceptable or medically feasible so I'll run down the list of what I've been doing. I've been in the process of coming out to everybody who means something to me. I've begun to properly take care of my skin and bar. I've been getting makeup lessons from my sister and practicing my voice. I've also been exercising although, being 6,3 and 140lbs I seriously doubt there's any more I can do in that department.   Most importantly I've been planning. Laying time tables, and harassing endos and therapists back in the states. I've been researching at least getting an anti-androgen DIY to get the ball rolling and to have a trump card when I meet an endo in the states. And I wish I could do estrogen but transitioning fully sounds like a good way to get socially ostracized here or beaten. I've been talking to my insurance and have been accumulating money and preparing jobs and school for when I go stateside."

I didn't know it was actually picked up and shared by people.  The original translation was quite transphobic and used slurs.

Family Compo was interesting but full of misinformation and general stupidity, it's a weird mix of offensive and extremely poignant stories that blew me away, but I eventually stopped reading because it just turned into the main (male) character getting into situations where he was ""forced"" to crossdress and being chased by men.  One of my favorite manga is After School Nightmare, which isn't directly trans related, but the main character struggles with gender and the plot is absolutely fantastic, you won't be able to put it down."

Long story short, I quit my job and never stopped taking HRT and now 2 years later I have a job that's a million times better.  So if the physical demands of your job aren't super intense and you're ok with putting up with coworkers macho bullshit, there's no reason you have to quit, but for me I knew I wasn't going to be able to and it was a good reason to get a fresh start anyway and who knows, maybe you'll end up with something better."

And then the pre- and post- appointments and stuff, filling perscriptions... If someone was able to get all this done in 1-2 weeks I'd be impressed!  This is the process I'm familiar with: 1) Get tested to see what your blood work is currently showing for hormone levels 2) Your endocrinologist (or other doctor) will look at the results and suggest specific, most likely low doses of both a blocker and a replacement hormone, and schedule another blood work in a month 3) Once the doctor sees the new blood work, they'll review and change your doses as necessary"

Those women have high levels of progesterone, which you don't get in a typical HRT regimen, and part of baby brain is your thoughts being dominated by preparing for birth and what follows."

At the time , Yale was an all male school. However, one member of said class had transitioned (mtf) and was somewhat nervous about the introducing herself. She approached the host and started “You might remember me as Peter when we left Yale…"", and the host immediately chimed in  “And now you’ve come back as yourself.“  Who was the host of this event? George W Bush, president at the time. Even people you disagree with on almost every issue can still be kind loving, and accepting."

The problem is proximity and mental health. Do you have doubts? Do you want to speak to a therapist? I ask because it can be a worse decision to not seek therapy when there are questions or doubts and dive into something you aren't ready for.

Usually when I see an asterisk in writing like that it usually is referenced somewhere else, but I never see any other references to the asterisk. Is there something I'm missing?"
asktransgender,3dzxbh,Carsandsarcasm,2,Tue Jul 21 03:17:25 2015 UTC,"I read a thread on this question a while back. I forget most of the details, but from memory, putting an asterisk on a word like that comes from a need in earlier computing. It's no longer necessary, and now, putting the asterisk there is sort of like an inside reference to this. It's sort of gone further than that now, though, because people use it despite not knowing what it means or if it's necessary.   The bottom line is, don't worry about it. It's completely redundant and has no significance."

I don't know if I'm going to transition or what (I'm questioning and I'm actually going to my first therapy session this week), but just knowing that so much of what I'm going to be going through will be covered if I do transition is a great relief to me.   I'm not sure what other states offer similar coverage, but I found out by searching ""Transgender health coverage in California"" in google and learned I was already covered by my current insurance."
asktransgender,3dzxbh,Sarah123t,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:30:18 2015 UTC,It probably doesn't exist but any state that covers transgender health through the state would probably be a good bet. MA covers everything and forces employers to offer it as well (as far as I know).

Price compare your hrt to buying it online illegally. Find a sliding scale therapist if you need to have therapy.

Also, see if you can find someone to help you with clothes and makeup etc. My mum got me my first few things, and has always been great to go shopping with.. See if you can find a female friend or relative to help you out with some initial purchases. I've also found department stores that have a personal shopper service to be really good.. you basically go and sip on a coffee while the personal shopper goes round the store and selects outfits for you to try on. They usually have a lot of experience with knowing what suits different body types etc, and I've found that they selected things that I would never have picked off the rail myself but found I loved when I tried them on.  Just take things slowly, try things out. There's no one way to be a woman or be trans. The early stages such as coming out are among the scariest. Once the drama'a over things get easier."

I've seen your pictures before and you struck me as quite pretty, so unless you have a booming dude voice, it is very likely that your problems here are less ones of gender and more ones of social group and approach.  If your current friends watched you go through a hard transition and weren't really there for you, maybe they're both not a great fit and/or used to seeing you as a fuckup because of transition troubles.

Took me a lot of work to get good at people, and a lot of time and searching to find my friends.   But your people are out there. Don't settle for people who see you as a freak or a burden. Find people who just like you for you. This may entail finding things to like about yourself beyond your looks (which, again, iirc are fine--but, as I am Zukowski-bound myself, I can relate to certain insecurities and preferences there) and the determination it takes to transition.   What makes you you? What kind of friend will you be to your ideal friends? How and what will they be to you? It can be really hard to shift gears, especially when you're lonely and desperate to belong, but it's worth stepping back to do. But I reiterate: mentally separate it from transition. See it as your first big post-transition project, but not as part of transitioning. You don't need these two issues interacting."

I won't try to pretend that people are accepting and that they don't reject you. The fact that your therapist tried to tells me they probably were not a good therapist. They completely invalidated your feelings and that is the wrong way to go about it. Sometimes it takes trying a few of them before you find one that actually helps. I've had 6 or so and finally the one I see now is real and doesn't bullshit me. I can't promise you'll find what you're looking for if you find a better therapist, but do you think maybe it might be worth a try if it has the possibility to save your life and makes the days less hard?"

Let me explain lol, there was a HUGE rivalry between the different engineering departments at my school. One of the reasons was due to one of the many events the school of engineering would hold. When the civil, chemical, mechanical, electrical engineers would design projects and display them. Then we'd try to have some of the projects interoperate. For example the civil engineers would build a bridge to spec that would allow an electrical engineer's robot built to spec to be able to traverse it. The problem was no one tended to build to spec. The civies would decrease the bridge width by a few millimeters so the robot would get stuck. EE's tended to well...the nice ones would just make theirs heavier to try and get them to collapse, others would find ways to break the bridges. We were not nice people."

Only reason I still like sex is the connection I get with my partner. I don't really care about my bits.  I don't really dislike them, just would greatly prefer the other set.

They just got dressed, often teased me (not horribly or anything) about the way I dressed under my clothes.  When my period came I hid it for three months - I finally told my mother when she started yelling at my sister for using too many pads...   I always had this certain longing to be a guy. I wanted to be strong and muscled, and I always wanted to shave my face. Not to mention peeing standing up.  There was always a sense of ""why wasn't I just born a guy?

Or not - once I came out as lesbian that gave me a lot of freedom to dress more masculine, but even then everyone was pushing me to be more femme.  For the last 8 years I have ignored pressing desires to have a penis, to not have a large chest. I even attempted to try and embrace my physical image - an attempt that finally lead me to accept that I am just not meant to live as a female.  And thank god... So ready to transition... But point is, I never felt what I thought dysphoria was. Even when I would experience crushing panic around friends when I realized I had crossed over into my masculine self.   It's amazing what we can convince ourselves of..."

It was almost 3 years after getting that under control that I recognized my transness for what it was and decided I could face it. I'm curious to see whether confronting and becoming comfortable with this has affected my depression beyond the really obvious happiness I've felt. I.e., at some point I'm curious if the antidepressant will be unnecessary.  But it's not giving me any side effects, so I agree with my psychiatrist that this is probably not a great time to scale back just to see."
asktransgender,3e03w1,NOOBonboPRO,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:28:00 2015 UTC,"oh, and to answer your original questions, I did not worry about whether I had dysphoria, because it's such a hard thing to try to understand based on definitions.  I realized that after almost 30 years of persistent wishing to be female, of dreaming about it, imagining (fantastical) ways it might be possible, feeling jealous of women's bodies, that these were all the evidence I needed that I was trans.  It also helped that I'd told my wife about these feelings (though not about how intense they were, partly because I was repressing that to a great degree) and that I knew she would be happy to be a part of the transition. Given that, I knew that I could begin the transition without destroying my family, which meant I could accept a bit of uncertainty. (That didn't last long at all.)"
asktransgender,3e03w1,summer_d,2,Tue Jul 21 02:33:05 2015 UTC,"Until a year and a half ago, I never, not even once, questioned my gender. Ever since I started puberty, I hated myself. I stopped looking in the mirror, I was horrified by how ugly I was, I had no self-esteem, etc. That sounds like normal teenager stuff, and it is to an extent, which is why I never questioned it. I figured it was normal. Looking back on it now, I can see it was partly dysphoria (but not completely). It's hard to identify it at the time, because it can manifest in different ways, and unless you're clued up on trans stuff, you probably don't even know what dysphoria is, let alone feels like. It's not until you understand more about being transgender and how a person feels when they have dysphoria that you start looking back and wondering if that's the culprit.  I never really conclusively figured out it was dysphoria until I took steps to trying to feel male. Tried out male pronouns and a male name, bought a binder. And holy crap, I felt good. I have severe anxiety, at my worst I go weeks or months without leaving the house. I went outside with my binder on during a week when I was having panic attacks every time I was near people, and I didn't have a single panic attack! I looked in the mirror, tried to look at my face as though I'm looking at a guy, and I thought, ""Wow, I actually look quite good."" I just felt more confident about myself. Even my body, strangely. I still have dysphoria, but I recognise it and understand it now, it's not an unknown hatred, which makes me feel better.  I decided transitioning is the right decision because I think about it every single day without fail. I dream about it. I don't think I can want something, obsess over it to that extent, and ignore it. I don't think it'd be healthy."

When I'm sad I'm sadder than I was and when I'm happy I'm much happier than I was, but now sadness doesn't stretch on for weeks like it did before and happiness doesn't disappear within 5 minutes. I do cry much more than I used to (which was hardly ever), but it's cathartic in a way it wasn't before.  And the anger I'd carried around with me for years disappeared. Before HRT I hated myself, I hated my life, and I hated practically the whole universe for who I was. These days I'm happy, I generally enjoy life, and I actually like myself. And because I'm no longer wrapped up in my own little nightmare I find myself able to care about people and events and things much, much more than I ever could before and I'm a far better person for it.

Presumably as my T dropped and E came up. My general mood began to improve around the same time, and the rest has been a more gradual change - it's not like I woke up one day and everything was better, but every now and then I'd realise that I was doing better than I had been the last time I thought about it. The first 6 months or so - when I guess my levels were really changing - was probably when the biggest changes happened but I'm still improving.  Looking at me now and at me 6 months ago there's no comparison, let alone nearly 22 months ago when I started.  Last June or so I ran out of both spiro and progynova for about 3 weeks, and the downturn in my mood was pretty dramatic. Basically the opposite of what I described happened. Not fun. HRT is so important for my mood, I never would have believed before that the difference could be so great.  As with anything, though, ymmv."

I do feel more irritable at times and quick to anger, and this anger is explosive, though that is in part also attributable to PTSD.

Even though my depression could still be pretty bad all thoughts of suicide subsided.  My mood is getting so much better that my outlook on life has really changed.  I view being transgender in a more positive light now, whereas before I found it humiliating and really hated it.  I'm also becoming far more ambitious, productive and fit.    You do become more emotional, but it's an individual thing in terms of how emotional you are.  I couldn't cry pre-transition.  I was either numb or furious.  Even now I'm pretty stoic.  It takes a lot to make me cry, but some people cry at the drop of a hat.  Apparently having a good cry makes you feel really good, but I wouldn't know.  Not sure how I feel about that."
asktransgender,3dxsq8,DeathToBreakdowns,7,Mon Jul 20 14:56:21 2015 UTC,"I started on spiro (anti-androgen/T-blocker) six months before I started on the rest of HRT; within a few weeks I was much calmer and less anxious, and more at peace with myself and the direction I wanted to take. So it's really the lack of T, rather than the addition of E, that triggers that.  Now that I'm on E and Provera, I've been... well, I WAS pretty emotional in the first couple of weeks, but I think I've stabilized. I'm still more emotional than I used to be, but I think I'm more ""normal"" now, compared to how stoic I used to be.  What I hadn't noticed until very recently is that not only have I started to genuinely thinking ""I AM a woman"" instead of just ""I am BECOMING a woman"", but I've started to actively reject the notion of myself as male. I was pretty easy-going about it until about two months ago, when I really started working on changing my name (at least at work). Now I twitch when I hear my old one... and since I still occasionally sign e-mails with my old name, or call myself my old name in my head, that's disconcerting. Also, this weekend I had little clean laundry and tried putting on some of my old clothes... and as soon as I saw myself in the mirror, I had the biggest bout of dysphoria I EVER had. I felt horribly wrong seeing myself in men's cut clothing.  (Which unfortunately means my wardrobe is a quarter of what it used to be. Going to have to start budgeting for replacements...)"

asktransgender,3dxsq8,NekoTheQueen,6,Mon Jul 20 16:00:00 2015 UTC,"I'm a little past two months.  Physically: My face has had a bit of subtle changes, I'm a little weaker physically, it's harder to get erect (and it doesn't happen without effort anymore), and my breasts have just started budding (nipples sore and hard more often but look the same, and minor breast tissue has formed, this is very recent).   Emotionally/mentally: Within a week of blockers I was happier, estrogen only made it better. In fact my mom commented several times about how she had never seen me smile so much. I'm more in touch with my emotions. Last night I felt sad while in bed, so I went fetal and cried until I wasn't sad anymore, it was nice. I'm realizing that my strong sense of empathy was strongly hindered by how hard it was to feel my own emotions. I'm becoming a little more nurturing too.  Gender roles: I'm becoming more comfortable in a tomboyish role. I don't need to do as much to feel feminine, and my femininity is much more body reliant. I feel more comfortable with feminine behavior, and I feel less like I'm betraying my womanhood when I'm ""one of the guys"" or other masculine behavior that I don't mind keeping.   Sexually: My sex drive went down a lot, now I only masturbate about once a day. My romantic needs skyrocketed. Where I used to be fantasizing about sleeping with the cute girl I just saw, now I'm more likely to fantasize about foreplay with her or literally sleeping with her, sex isn't the goal anymore, but rather just another step in a long journey of romance. I've become more confident in my sexual orientation because the line between attractive (but I don't want to do anything sexual/romantic with them) and attractive is becoming more clear as is the line between ""want to be"" and ""want to be with"" (although I should note cis queer women often have a hard time with that line, it's not easy to find and may not be part of hormones)."

I wasn't unable to cry or possessed by endless hormonal rage to begin with, but I'm not super-excitable either. I'm more comfortable thanks to the (unfortunately minor) physical changes, and antiandrogens don't tend to boost for your sex drive, but I don't think that's what you're asking about.

asktransgender,3dxsq8,Snevitje,3,Mon Jul 20 16:40:44 2015 UTC,"With testosterone it was like feeling for stuff through thick wool mittens. The feelings were there but they were very muted and somewhat indistinct and faint. Except for anger; that one was always within easy reach and was often mistakenly grasped when searching for some other emotion.   On estrogen everything else is very much on surface and easy to access; but that can make things swingy if I'm not careful. It also feels like I'm responding and picking up on the emotions in others more often, which can also cause me to get carried away as well. I cry more, but it's much easier to control and dismiss, and any negative effects dissipate pretty quickly and I move on from whatever it was. Overall I'm exponentially happier even if I break down and physically cry more."

The thing that I noticed, and my wife was asking about, is that I feel 'normal'. I don't feel more feminine than I did before. I don't feel less of a man. Dysphoria is less. But, I just feel like things are the way they are supposed to be now. Hard to explain. But, it just feels like estrogen was what my body was lacking previously.

asktransgender,3dxsq8,PC509,2,Mon Jul 20 22:05:49 2015 UTC,"The first two months all I saw was weight loss and my mental stability start to come full circle.  With testosterone in my body, my brain messes up really bad.  Almost constant anxiety, hyper emotional, constantly in some state of depression.  In month three, the testicles finally started to really shrink.  Boobs started to grow, hips started to come along, skin started to get softer.  I think I was month four when my biological clock went off.  I became ok with the fact that I might never have a kid and had been ok with it for a long time.  Sometime during month four my brain went off and I went from being ok with it, to figuring out what I need to do to get my life organized enough to adopt.  I found that extreme stress will almost halt progress.  I Ended up in two stressful situations, one of which made me really emotionally unstable.  By the time both the problems had been resolved my face started to really show structure change.  I had tried to transition once before, but economic stress forced me to de-transition.  So this time I was ready for everything and starting over again was actually exciting instead of nerve racking.  However, I felt that I had hit a wall with my transition this summer and really felt that becoming sexually active again would help at least some of it.  After a few really bad dates, and a bunch of men that can't seem to read, I managed to meet someone.  Having someone around has been amazing for me.  My psychology, my voice, how comfortable I feel walking down the street.  Oh and did I mention that it seems like good 'ol fashion sex with the right person is a stimulant to transitioning.  That's right, my boobs have grown more in the last month than the last three!  I think a lot of it has to do with the sudden boost in exercise.  As for crying.  It's ok when it happens.  I get overwhelmed with euphoria and break out into tears almost always.  Sometimes a bad social situation will completely set me off.  Things happen, crying is a coping tool, it's ok to let it happen.  It's not ok to bottle your feelings up inside."

Now I feel things a bit too much (including anger), but I'm a little better equipped to deal with it... maybe. Some mental illness is affecting that, tho.  The overly-emotional crying thing went down over time. My E levels are even higher than they were when I started. Maybe it's just a matter of getting used to it?  And that's... that's pretty much it. No connecting better with other people, increased confidence/self-acceptance, sense of 'peace' or 'calmness' (aside from the fact that being refused HRT was making me seriously upset).

It is normal to cry a lot in that stage.   The first thing I noticed on HRT was that I felt way more calmer and less aggressive.  Then one day I reaized that my mind was somehow changed. It felt that I thought differently, tended to overthink stuff. That was something I had to got used to but it worked quick.   I do cry a more then pre HRT. There is at least on daily occasion that makes my eyes all teary. Might be Joyful things or sad things.   When it comes to crying, Sometimes I feel it is just necessary and it is cathartic. After a good cry I feel a lot better.   And in General. Since month 3 I just feel happy and smiley most of the time. It is so relieving to run on the right hormones. It makes me feel so good.

I can't say I feel the second set, though; although, I never pondered on the issue of gender until my mid 20s.    Anyway, it's fine to have doubts. If you're not seeing a therapist right now, I suggest that you do. They will help you a lot with figuring things out. Transition is a big step to take, and it's long-term (especially if you begin HRT).    Try things out. In fact, you can test-drive HRT for a few months to see how it makes you feel without there being any lasting effects.    Plus, you have to weigh what is the most important to you: being who you are and risk losing friends and family, or being who you are not just to keep them around and to keep your male privileges in tact. Once you transition, you can say goodbye to those privileges, but you will gain some new ones.    Good luck in whatever you do!"
asktransgender,3e0rny,illuminess,2,Tue Jul 21 06:14:51 2015 UTC,"I realized I was trans when I was I was 15 actually, so it was just a few years before you. Sometimes trans people don't even realize until after puberty, but usually realize that there were always really intense signs. Maybe you have had experiences that you don't remember yet?   A lot of your doubs actually sound like fears, which can sometimes manifest as doubt. Like, your fear of losing your life and people close to you. But if you are considering your identity, try separating the fear from doubt, like by asking yourself ""if there was a magic button that could instantly make me a girl with a classically female body instantly, and everyone would treat me like a girl and think I was a girl for my whole life, would I press it?"" People say that asking themselves that made the answer suddenly clear for them.  About masculinity, I like to watch cis women sometimes and they can have masculine personality traits and habits too. Its totally OK and normal to embrace whatever gender expression works for you! Even if that means being a feminine man instead of a trans woman if you decide that works for you.   You don't have to decide today or tomorrow, you can take all the time you need to make sure you are making the right decision. But if being male or having a male body doesn't really distress you, make sure you think about it a lot until you are very sure."

asktransgender,3e0o7h,andynotandy,2,Tue Jul 21 05:28:02 2015 UTC,"I'm partially writing this as a way to help myself, as I have the same fears and anxiety you do.   I recently started facing my realities too after years of being a shut-in with alcohol and various drugs to help numb me and my mind, but I can't do it anymore.  As of last week, some sort of bomb in my head just went off full-time. The numerous bowls of weed I smoke cannot shut the fact up in my head anymore that I've been horribly depressed and on the verge of possible hurting myself for a LOOOOONG time.  Only by coming to this subreddit, has my anxiety gone down a bit. I got an amazing amount of information from /u/Henchman24Rip to which I am ever grateful for even reducing my fears the smallest amount.  It's support. Support you and I have never had. I am calling around to find someone myself. I still got into the worst bout of depression today where I just slept for hours and didn't call anyone. But, I woke up pissed off and in an even bigger charged mood to seek information out that I needed.   This is not going to stop and just tell yourself that. The Phsychatrist is there to help, and if you feel they aren't listening, then find another. They aren't there to get involved into your personal life, they have their own to worry about. They aren't there to out you to everyone (That would be against the law anyway). They are there to help you, and I, understand what's going on. Because fuck-if-I-know how to deal with this anymore! I have no true friends I can trust to come out too. I just realized tonight by looking at a whole slew of pictures through watery eyes, that I set aside the great friends to find a life as a boy and got involved with a girl who ultimately introduced me to drugs, VERY dangerous people, and crippling depression/anxiety that has been going on for a good 15 years now.  I can't deal with this anymore. You can't deal with this anymore. It hurts to much to keep things held in anymore. I, and you, need to be strong and tell ourselves, ""I failed in the past. Not anymore.""   I've sat in lonely darkness for years now. I've reached the breaking point of doing what others expect of me. With all that's happening now in the transgender world vs how it was when I really wanted to come out in the 90's, life is too short and fuck all the haters.  I expect a few things to be difficult when I transition. Job/Relationships/Friends/Meeting People/etc... It's FEAR. All just fear. A horrible emotion that can come in handy during the right moment, but when dealing with being yourself til the day you die, its the worst thing in the world.  Please don't be afraid or nervous. You are further than I am at this point. I haven't even gotten an appointment. Know that there are people out here in this world that are not full of bigotry and closed minded thoughts who wish anyone in humanity the absolute best at what or however they chose to be. We are your friends. We are your family. Seek us out, don't wait for us to come to you.   After Wednesday you will probably have a whole new confidence. I know, after searching the things I did today, the work I kinda did on myself, I haven't felt this confident in a LONG time. It's such a weird feeling to be somewhat happy and confident again after so long. But it's like a new drug I can't seem to shake now and I hope I never do. I wish you all the best in the world. DO NOT FRET! That doctor more than respects that you had the time to think about yourself and seek answers instead of possibly becoming another morbid statistic in the transgender community. Chin up honey!"

Afraid of how I'm viewed by others. I'm questioning now, but I'm hoping to have answers in less than 36 hours. Answers that I think will probably lead to more fears.  I KNOW (more fears not actual fact) that if I'm trans and I decide to transition, I'll never pass. I fear that my friends and family won't be supportive. I fear that I'll go through life being seen as a freak. I fear that some transphobic asshole will seriously hurt me someday or worse. I fear that no one will ever love me again. But, if this is who I am, I'd rather go through life being me than being an actor who played the happy guy his whole life in an award worthy performance.   Life hasn't been easy for me. I'm trying to live life as the world throws sticks in the spokes of the wheels of the bike that is my life. I just have to pick myself up, and carry on. There's a lot of sticks in those spokes, but I'm hoping this therapist can help me remove so that I can move on to a happier place in my life.  I don't know where I'm going with this, and that last paragraph didn't really make any sense, so I'll just end with another thank you for sharing your story with me.

I was crying myself to sleep constantly, wondering if I'd ever be happy with someone, if I even deserve someone I'm happy with.  Giving up a relationship is hard, I've only been with my boyfriend for a year and a bit and if he told me now to choose between my transition or him I'd probably still choose him, even knowing I wouldn't be able to last very long before either killing myself or giving in and transitioning.

Old Navy and Target are great (and they are right next to each other at my local mall) for a lot of the simple items. for getting something a little higher quality I look for outlet stores/malls like nordstroms Rack and occassionally TJ Max/Marshalls.   If you have a nice short dress a pair of leggings or jeans worn under it with calf or knee length boots can be a great casual look as well.
asktransgender,3dxzx5,Rebecca98105,5,Mon Jul 20 15:00:12 2015 UTC,"+1 for TJ Maxx. If there's a city nearby that has a more wealthy population, it could be well worth it to visit a second-hand shop like Goodwill there, too."

But yeah you still need some strictly casual clothes. Gap, American Eagle, and Kohl's have reasonably priced casual clothes in a large range of sizes. I like Hollister too but their stuff runs small. I think their jeans only go up to 5 or 7. Target and Old Navy are great for plain tees and tanks. Shoes, I don't know. I have average size feet, 7 or 7 1/2, so I can't help you there."
asktransgender,3dxzx5,ham-girl,2,Mon Jul 20 14:45:05 2015 UTC,"For clothing it really depends on your style, age, and what they are making that year.

Up gets tough, but you can find many hundreds of 11W just by shopping, Amazon, Zappos, Macy's and Shoes.com.  If I can find free shipping both ways I might just buy one pair at a time.  If I can't get free shipping, then I'll try and find 4 things with good potential and keep 1 maybe 2 and return the rest."

asktransgender,3e0gbi,iamnotme_mtf,5,Tue Jul 21 00:25:36 2015 UTC,"imagine this scenario: you agree to have an open relationship. it goes nowhere for you. she has sex frequently, with others, not you, and enjoys herself and finds intimacy with them. are you comfortable in this scenario? are you the jealous type?  open relationships aren't for everyone, and while I enjoy mine, lots of people dont think about the above, they only think about the flirting they did that one time with the cute one.  and really the above is not that wierd to happen. If you want to try this route, just make sure you two are ready for it"

I've been ill for the past six years (nothing like what you both are going through, but it's turned my life upside down), and it freaks me out to think that, no matter how long I live for, I've wasted six precious years, the best years. So I kind of understand what you're saying, that you want to make the most of the health you do currently have.  I think rather than bring up an open relationship, it's best to kind of work your way up to the topic. Like, basically just tell her what you've told us, talk about the positives, the negatives, your worries, your thoughts, etc., and then allow her to do the same. I think starting out by opening the lines of communication on this particular issue of your relationship/health will do you both good, while allowing you to eventually discuss the possibility of an open relationship, without it seemingly coming out of nowhere for her."
asktransgender,3e0gbi,HippieSoulPunx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:56:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's best to step back from your sense of obligation, just take that off the table, and examine your feelings for your partner free of any sense that you owe her anything or that she owes you anything. Is there still a relationship there? Do you feel love for her outside of obligation? If not, you may as well end things because it's just going to turn toxic for both of you, IME.  If you love her and you feel you want to be with her regardless of any obligation or debt, then the next thing to consider is, why do you feel entitled to any kind of sexual or wild experience that you haven't had? Why do you feel like you have a right to those experiences? Are you assuming that everyone gets to have something that actually not everyone does? Are they things you actually WANT, or things you feel obligated to have had in your life because you think that it's ""normal""? Wild sex with multiple partners isn't something everyone wants or experiences - by choice. Is this a case of wanting what you don't have just because you don't have it? Will it really make your life better or produce a sense of achievement or a life well lived to get those experiences?  Do you actually want an open relationship, or is this just a compromise to get a taste of what you actually want (total freedom and release from responsibility) without feeling guilty for not repaying a perceived debt? Do you actually genuinely want to have sex with others, or do you just have classic fear of missing out that disappears if you actually think about how you would feel after getting that sex and life going on? If someone could wave a wand and make it so your partner didn't want to be with you and would be taken care of, would you be happy or sad?  Just some thoughts to ponder (I'm not really interested in the answers myself, they're answers for you to explore for yourself). By the time you answer them all you'll probably figure out what you want to do."
asktransgender,3e0gbi,postmoderncrack,2,Tue Jul 21 14:52:05 2015 UTC,"This is a really tough and tricky subject to bring up. First off, you're definitely not selfish. Relationships take time and work, and being that you're looking for advice on how to talk to her about it, rather than just acting on your desires, shows that you're anything but selfish. We're all human and we all have things we want, especially in the case of lost time.   Speaking to her about it will help. The absolute worst case I could possibly imagine would be she gets upset, at which point you'll also be upset, but you also might experience these desires fading as your love of her takes over. I don't know you, but you seem to be the kind of person that wouldn't proceed if she said she'd be upset by this.  On the other hand, she might react positively, knowing that you genuinely just want to experience things you never had a chance to experience. What you also have to consider is the possibility she also wants to experience things outside of the relationship you've had thus far. At which point you have to ask yourself, are you okay with this? Everyone's different. My only personal experience was one of my closest friends and his girlfriend agreed to an open relationship. It sounds great in theory, until jealousy and emotions set it. Yes, being able to explore is great, but it can also cause problems. In his case, her being intimate with someone else made him feel horrible, even though he was also free to do the same.   Again, everyone's different. The only way to know what's going to happen is talking about it.  Good luck to you in whatever you decide to do. I hope everything works out for you"

There's a whole group of us.  Of all religions, Mormons have the most trouble separating ""Mormon culture"" from ""Mormon teaching.""  There is no official church stance on transgender members.  Different wards (congregations) will treat trans members differently, but for every member I know who has been treated poorly, there is one who has been fully accepted.  Edited to add: I should also say that I'm under no delusions that my church is perfect.  It is very cis, white, and male-centric.  Just meant to say that anyone of the Mormon faith implying that you are going straight to hell is spouting doctrine that isn't from the church."
asktransgender,3dxmd0,MidgarFlowerGirl,3,Mon Jul 20 13:07:19 2015 UTC,"As someone from Utah, I have a passing interest in mormon affairs.   What you say re: official policy simply isn't true. According to the church disseminated 'manual:'  'Disciplinary councils may also be convened to consider a member’s standing in the Church following serious transgression such as ... transsexual operation...'  This passage comes from official church ""Commentary and Background Information of D&C 102: Disciplinary Councils.""  Threatening to disfellow or excommunicate people who get SRS seems like a pretty clear 'official policy' to me. There are other references available through the search function on lds.org, however they are behind a paywall. Other available references discuss trans people in the context of the Proclamation of the Family and speeches given about the nature of gender in mormon cosmology. None of which are particularly positive towards trans people.   You say that know trans peeps who are 'fully accepted.' Are any of those people open about their experiences? Doing a quick google search, I can't see anyone who is both transitioning and accepted by their ward, much less being accepted by the higher ups. The only people I'm aware of are either:    Partaking in some repairitive therapy nonsesne. Trying to 'pray the trans away.' Only comfortable calling themselves culturally mormon. But have otherwise dissociated from the church itself."
asktransgender,3dxmd0,MomGinny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:57:26 2015 UTC,"The potion you quote is the only mention of transgender or transexual anything in any official church book.  And, like I said with acceptance, results vary wildly based on the people doing the leading in a given area.  Some members have SRS with no trouble; others do face disciplinary councils. (Also, there's no paywall on lds.org. Not sure what you were running into.)  I know several people who are out to either their whole ward or their leadership.  Their openness is up to them, however, as I know them from a private Facebook group for trans Mormons.  Yes, some have had a rough time of it.  Some are disfellowshipped or made to feel unwelcome.  But some are not.  Some people attend wards as themselves with no problem.  Some are even in Utah.  As I said, the church isn't perfect.  That passage is troubling, and has caused some trans members no end of heartache and pain. If any trans members are treated poorly, it is of concern to all trans members. But the biggest issue is cultural. As I'm sure you're aware, Utah Mormons can be very zealous, and often speak their opinions as Gospel truth.  Edit: My wife just pointed out a couple of other mentions in Leadership handbooks I had forgotten about.  One about approval for transitioned people to get baptized, and one that says after SRS we will not be able to hold a temple recommend.  Hadn't seen that one before, and it is admittedly troubling."
asktransgender,3dxmd0,Wavooka,2,Tue Jul 21 03:16:27 2015 UTC,"Also, there's no paywall on lds.org. Not sure what you were running into.   Paywall is just a euphemism. Actually many parts of the site are closed to non-members. This is the logon screen. Granted, I haven't made a non-member account since my interest in looking at church materials is pretty slim so I don't know what distinctions there are between the types of accounts.   As for other official church positions, the church refuses to baptize people who are considering transition and post transition peeps need to have special permission from the first presidency to be baptized. Further, they aren't allowed to hold callings or have a temple endowment. (?)  Evidence is from a church spokesperson, quoted in this sltrib article from March.     ""Because of this,"" church spokesman Eric Hawkins writes in an emailed statement, ""the church does not baptize those who are planning transsexual operations. If a person has already had such an operation and wishes to join the church, they may be baptized only after an interview with the mission president and approval by the First Presidency.  ""The church does not ordain transgender people to the priesthood or issue temple recommends to them,"" Hawkins adds. ""Church leaders counsel already-baptized members against elective transsexual operations, and bishops may refer specific cases to the stake president for possible resolution at that level or by the First Presidency.    //> a private Facebook group for trans Mormons  Is that the North Star group?   Some people attend wards as themselves with no problem. Some are even in Utah.   I really want to believe this. But having grown up in Utah I have a hard time believing rumors (in either direction) about what is happening the church.   Can you say if these people are actually transitioning? What is their role in the church now? Are they forced to divorce or something similar? Do any of them write or speak publicly from their experiences?  I don't mean to be rude, but I ask because I believe that instilling false hopes in people about how the church operates is needlessly cruel. Being queer in Utah I've known tons and tons of people who were really traumatized by the church or it's members. Telling them that things are changing, that people are being allowed to transition or even that trans people can participate fully in church life can lead to some really poor life choices for queer people."
asktransgender,3dxmd0,MomGinny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:49:31 2015 UTC,"Re paywall: Ahh, gotcha.  If it's what I'm thinking of, it would only be accessible with the appropriate leadership access.  I don't know about the callings aspect (I swear some of the people in my group have callings, but I could very possibly be wrong), but you are correct with regards to temple ordinances as I understand it.  The group I am referring to us affiliated with Northstar, yes. I don't know if it's one of their official groups, but there is definitely some overlap.  For those members attending church as themselves, I only mentioned it because they are transitioning or socially transitioned.  Nobody I know has been forced to or even asked to divorce. There is a new Northstar site with some stories, though last I looked they were all from non-transitioning members.  There may be new ones now.  My goal is not to put false hopes into anyone's heart or mind.  I don't believe in most of the proselytizing that goes on anyway, and I couldn't in good conscience recommend the church to queer people considering it.  But for those already inside, who believe in the teachings of the church and don't want to lose their faith in a time when so much else is also changing, I don't think it's as bad as it is commonly portrayed.  Maybe it's idealism, maybe it's Stockholm syndrome, I don't know."

I understand why it might seem that way to you. However it is not. Disciplinary hearings in these cases ""may"" be convened, but are in no way required. It is important to remember that this is a church run and populated by imperfect people. It also bears keeping in mind that this is current church policy, not doctrine.  It's also worth noting this quote from Apostle Dallin H. Oaks during a late-january Trib Talk interview:   ""...being acquainted with the unique problems of a transgender situation is something we have not had so much experience with, and we have some unfinished business in teaching on that.""   You can find the video recording of that interview here The question asked begins at 11:40 and the portion of Elder Oaks' response that concerns the church's position on trans* issues begins at 14:09."
asktransgender,3dxmd0,Ohnana_,2,Tue Jul 21 03:33:58 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I never said it was doctrine only official policy- which it clearly is. If something is published in a handbook about governing the church, I don't really see how it can be anything other than official policy.   So I don't really get what you mean when you say that it isn't an official policy. Unless I've misinterpreted what you said?  Although you are totally right that hearings seem to be pretty arbitrarily convened. (Unless you happen to piss off someone downtown, as in the case of the recent excommunications.)   I mentioned that policy as an example for one of consequences that can happen to trans people in the church. Check out the reply I gave to your wife to see some of the other official policies that make life pretty hard for trans mormons.  You make the distinction between policy and doctrine, but as an outsider with a decade of experience in the queer community here, the difference seems marginal at best. Whether queers are being mistreated under the guise of policy or doctrine it doesn't change the fact that they are being hurt. Not to dredge up the past, but so as I can recall the exclusion on black people participating fully in the church was never doctrinal- but that didn't really ameliorate the damage done to racial minorities in the church. So I don't think the distinction is really meaningful here.   Do you think the comment by Dallin Oaks is significant? To me, it seems to be basically neutral on the question of trans people. And with his passing I don't think it matters much in any case."
asktransgender,3dxmd0,HippieSoulPunx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:17:21 2015 UTC,"OOPS! That was my bad. I even c/p'd that section and I didn't catch it. Apologies about that!  I know from my experiences with my own bishop, it is unlikely that there will be any disciplinary action taken in my wife's case unless something else in her life warrants it - open attempts to undermine the church (which I was told just being trans and transitioning do not equal), abuse, the other things that one might convene disciplinary councils for. So I can only speak first-hand to my experiences, though I have heard many stories from others via the facebook group we are in. We also have not reached the point of consulting our stake president yet, so it's possible that could change. But I hope that if our SP does turn out to be negative towards our situation, the support of our bishop will help sway him.  Consequences -can- happen to trans members of the church. We live in a fallen world and the church leadership is made up of imperfect people. I hate it. I understand why discretion in these cases is left up to the bishops/stake presidents (because they are the ones on the ground, charged with knowing the members assigned to them, and helping guide them away from less spiritual paths), but I don't like that there is little to no education on the topic for leadership. That is something I would like for Salt Lake to remedy, as I had do a lot of educating our bishop (we are out in frontier mormon-land, far from Utah, btw) about what being transgender meant and how transition would be affecting out lives in the future.   You are right, the doctrine/policy distinction doesn't fix everything, and I hate that people are hurting. I pray pretty constantly for illumination on this subject - to know once and for all if we ought to be welcome everywhere in the church my heart is drawn to. And I grieve with those who are having horrible experiences at the hands of those leaders who are closed minded/hard hearted, and using their authority unjustly. The church's leadership overall needs to do better.  I do think that Elder Oaks' comment is significant. He gave that interview with Elder Christofferson, and if his statement had been incorrect, the other apostle would have corrected it. The fact that they have not studied the issue enough to have an opinion is a hopeful one for me, because it leaves open the possibility that someday policies concerning transgender members may change. It doesn't do anything for those of us in the thick of it right now, but it may lessen the load on our children, which I will be grateful for."

From Wikipedia:   Radical Atheism is a major intervention in deconstruction. Against the prevalent notion that there was an ethical or religious “turn” in the thinking of Jacques Derrida, Hägglund argues that a radical atheism informs his work from beginning to end. Atheism has traditionally limited itself to denying the existence of God and immortality, without questioning the desire for God and immortality. In contrast, radical atheism seeks to demonstrate that the so-called desire for immortality dissimulates a desire for survival that precedes it and contradicts it from within. Rather than being dependent on a transcendent ideal, all our commitments presuppose an investment in and care for the finite. Developing a deconstructive account of time, Hägglund shows how Derrida rethinks the constitution of identity, the violence of ethics, the desire of religion, and political emancipation in accordance with the condition of temporal finitude."

In principle, atheism has basically one belief, that God is less likely to exist than to not exist.  Now, while that's the only belief, PZ Myers had a good point on this(even if you don't like him, you should like this point he raised)... this belief has implications.  Most significantly, we have to rely on other humans to solve problems, there's no deity out there to come in and help.  You'd think that would drive a desire to learn more about the world, reviewing new evidence and updating your beliefs accordingly,  and to treat people well...  But sadly, there's a lot of shit understanding of the science involved in trans issues in the atheist community.  And when you've got a bunch of people that pretty much revere science, if the science they are going off is trash... it gets pretty messed up.  And of course they cannot possibly be bigoted because that's a thing religious people do.

asktransgender,3e0z6y,heavymetaljew,2,Tue Jul 21 06:08:15 2015 UTC,"Dulles is a really pretty airport, it's in NOVA so there really isn't any danger other than you know whatever crime is common. Just have fun, there are some great restaurants in the DC metro area if you want to try interesting cuisine.   VA is not a dangerous place at all. It gets a bad rap because it doesn't have trans inclusive legislation. For the most part, as in anywhere, so long as you are polite and considerate of people, they are polite and considerate of you. I have had one or two problems in my entire life living in VA, and in one case I had it coming (I was being a smarmy little shit and the guy took a pot shot) the other time I was with a group of people and we got shouted at. Either of those could happen in San Francisco, Portland, or Seattle (three most trans positive places I could think of).  So in conclusion, safety wise, keep your bag within eyes sight at all times, Follow TSA instructions, and prepare for a bit of humidity and heat when you leave the concourse lol."

Just have fun, there are some great restaurants in the DC metro area if you want to try interesting cuisine.    Awesome. I'm going into the middle of nowhere, so I won't have time to visit DC unfortunately. I'll likely be going back to the east coast in October to visit family in Maryland, so that'll be fun.   For the most part, as in anywhere, so long as you are polite and considerate of people, they are polite and considerate of you.   Sounds like a solid plan.    prepare for a bit of humidity and heat when you leave the concourse lol.   Ah crap, I had forgotten about that one. I shouldn't have, since one of my best friends from my university is from Maryland, and he's bitched to me about the humidity multiple times."

asktransgender,3dyo9q,tadzioizdat,4,Mon Jul 20 17:05:03 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, yeah. I live in the UK, and it seems that you need to have at least some time of living fully as your gender before starting HRT. Sucks, but I can kind of understand."
asktransgender,3dyo9q,tadzioizdat,5,Mon Jul 20 17:10:01 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, by the DSM-V and the WPATH RLE isn't a requirement anymore. I don't know how it is in the UK but at least here in Spain gatekeeping therapists insist it a requirement when it no longer is"
asktransgender,3dyo9q,Evil_Kitteh,3,Mon Jul 20 17:27:49 2015 UTC,In Scotland the RLE seems to be for getting SRS not HRT so I can't see it being different in the rest of the UK.
asktransgender,3dyo9q,tadzioizdat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:52:15 2015 UTC,"Which in my opinion makes more sense, even if I still believe RLE should not in any way be compulsory. Even so, the requirements of being a minimum length of time on HRT to get SRS already ""force"" you to have some sort of RLE and make it significantly easier to go full time for that. Going full time without hormones would be torture for the majority of trans people who don't pass without hrt."
asktransgender,3dyo9q,nuovo_donna,3,Mon Jul 20 18:09:16 2015 UTC,"Are you in Europe or somewhere that RLE is required for a recommendation to HRT?  If so, RLE start date is somewhat of an honor system thing so long as you are showing tangible steps towards living as your gender.  Like how you dress, and ask to be referred to.  If your therapist googled you and found an unambiguously female Facebook page for you, with no sign of you coming out, they're probably question your sincerity.  I'm not sure if any of Canada still requires RLE.  I know that nowhere in the US should be."
asktransgender,3dyo9q,nuovo_donna,4,Mon Jul 20 17:03:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I live in the UK, and I've seen that people have mentioned needing to go through RLE before starting HRT, so I was just confused about how you document it to prove that you've been living as your gender for whatever amount of time. But if it's somewhat flexible, then that should be a lot easier."
asktransgender,3dyo9q,TurtleTape,2,Mon Jul 20 17:12:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's ""somewhat"" flexible.  Like some conservative therapist might say your RLE starts with your first appointment assuming you show up presenting male with a male name preference.  Others might take your word that you've been living as a male for X months.  It probably comes down to how convincing and consistent you are when describing your life."
asktransgender,3dyo9q,Lahee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:15:26 2015 UTC,"afaik, the UK no longer requires RLE for HRT. However, that's a relatively recent thing as of the past couple of years, so there may be some officials who think it's required. It isn't."
asktransgender,3dyo9q,peeliepoker,3,Mon Jul 20 17:54:04 2015 UTC,"I am a patient of the North East gender dysphoria service, RLE is still required to receive HRT. If that is the case here, then it is most likely an NHS-wide policy.  I'd suggest calling your regional GDS to find out how they operate, whether you're on the waiting list or not OP =]  I feel the need to add that the general consensus within my regional service is that HRT helps you to go through with RLE, which leads to the service being quite lenient. I've been told that the RLE requirement is more of a 'show of good will', and to make sure that you know what you're getting in to."

asktransgender,3dyo9q,peeliepoker,3,Tue Jul 21 18:14:43 2015 UTC,"Generally it would be documented by self report under the supervision of a therapist. So basically you'd do therapy for a year and the therapist would judge if you lived full time.   However, there's a lot of movement away from this requirement. It puts unnecessary and burdensome restrictions on trans people. There's relatively little risk behind transitioning, and very few people change their minds or detransition."
asktransgender,3dyo9q,KKae,3,Mon Jul 20 17:32:53 2015 UTC,"If you can provide evidence of some sort that indicates that you've been living as a male that would be useful otherwise the GIC is likely to take RLE from the date that you change your name.  In my case I changed my name in the November just before I went full time. I went full time the following January and started HRT in the April, 6 months after my name change which was the requirement at my GIC for starting hormones."

I'm 25 and I've never played WoW, but I've played a crap ton of other MMORPGS and I find that at this point in time if my character isn't female I simply don't want to play. When I started making female toons I used the same excuses you did and tried to play it off, but I was embarassed (although at this point in my life I'm kind of just like ""well fuck it, who cares""). I'm not married, so I don't have to worry about that situation, but I'm also still figuring everything out and its mildly terrifying. I don't really have any advice for you, it seems that you've got a pretty good handle on things and you know already to find a therapist, but I just wanted to say good luck in figuring things out :)  PS: In relation to your wife's possible reaction if you end up telling her.    She recently told me about a cousin of hers who had a boyfriend who got her to move to France and it turned out he was gay and he left her there in France. She was super pissed about this, so I think I know the reaction.   I don't see the connection here. Yeah the guy ended up being gay, but it seems to me that the thing to be pissed about is he abandoned her in France. I'd be pissed because of that fact alone. So unless she specifically said something about not being ok with gay people, I'm not sure that her reaction is indicative of anything LGBT related."

Haven't made a male character since 2012 and he only made it to about level 40 before I rerolled him as a girl. I've race changed characters and made them male during that and they've been left in the dust as well. I haven't had a male main character since 2008. Every max level character I have is female and all the characters on the 2 servers I play on are female. Like I said, it was instinct when I made them. There was no second thought when choosing the gender.  Yeah I think it just made me nervous. I talked to her about that a little while ago. It is exactly that. The abandoned aspect of it. The girl actually thought about suicide. They were married and he left her for a man in a country she had no friends in and didn't speak the language. His family actually helped her out and got her on her feet. I actually forgot she has a gay half-brother who she is in contact with. I still don't know her reaction."

Yeah I think it just made me nervous.   Yeah I can understand why it made you nervous, the idea of being trans is scary.

The irony is that the person who initially teased me jokingly for playing a female character was the first person I told and has been super supportive.

It sounds like a lot of your exploration so far has been digital in nature. I get that; I slowly went from a male to female characters on WoW too, and in other games I played I haven't played anything but female characters in years. In WoW, it was a slow progression because I felt like I was doing something forbidden. As I came across more guys playing female toons I decided it was alright.  Eventually I realized I identified with those characters.  Clothes and makeup and nail polish and all that are props, but arguably so are the games. If you haven't tried, maybe experimenting in that direction is your next step? My standard initial advice is always therapy, but you seem to have that covered already."

I did get some shit for it (jokingly). I get that it's normal. Most guys will play a female toon at some point. I literally can't play a male character anymore. No joke I've sat there wishing I could be my female toons. That I believe is where the jump from normal to possibly trans would lie?"

In that regard, there's not much of a difference. It's almost always better to start earlier rather than later, assuming you know you want to do it, but of course, personal circumstances can change things.  Are there any benefits? Yeah: results are typically better the younger you start. Will they be extremely noticeable? I don't think so."

I choose to be more tomboy than girly 99% of days and all of my friends, most of my family (all but one stupid person), and my work all treat me as one of the girls. I know I got lucky but all I've really done is grow my hair out and say call me she and they did. That and all of the inter turmoil and confusion and bad thoughts...  If you really can't do it now it won't be the end of the world but one thing I have realized I need to ask myself is what really will change tomorrow to make it easier.

Getting started sooner rather than later is usually more helpful.  However, bear in mind that, as someone below the age of nineteen, you might not be able to get on full HRT, you might only qualify for hormone blockers. It depends a lot on where you live, etc. And the human body needs some kind of hormone in it, generally, because they are part of keeping your bones strong."

If you asking the absolute minimum time you could see about getting them there - I believe that once you reach whatever age requirement they have then as long as you are convincing you can have it whenever you want. If you've not been on HRT at all it would be pretty obvious, and I don't think you'd have much chance (it would also be a pretty dumb idea generally)."

For better or worse, the requirement for surgery is only 1 year instead of 2-3, which I think it used to be in the long ago days.  If you're starting hrt at 17 you probs already have a therapist. Ask them to write you a letter, and find a second therapist. I didn't have any trouble getting a second letter at age 20, it took 2 visits. I'm not sure if you can schedule a surgery date before you've gotten one or both letters but the scheduling for surgery will take another couple of months, up to a year possibly, depending on when you want it done (I imagine the summer is more heavily booked because people aren't in school?).

But one day, I took my phone to my car and rang. I was nervous as hell, but I did it. I made an appointment. One of the greatest achievements of my life!   My advice is.. just do it.

And if at any point you end up uncomfortable and want to stop, you always have that option.    You can also just tell yourself you're your own secretary, and you have to make this appointment for your boss.

My entire life has been spent worrying about the happiness and needs of others. I specifically swept this under my mental rug for so long to try and keep everyone else happy. I always consider the happiness of others over mine. But enough is enough, it's time for me to do something for me.  As far as support, financially and such it's my mom. I live with her and am a full time student, going to try finding a part time job soon to start saving money for transition related costs, as well as to just have some money for myself. Emotional support I have lots of lifelines. A few of my closest friends know about this and actively talk to me about it. Ironically the least helpful person in my life in terms of emotional support is my girlfriend. It's gotten to a point where I'm no longer afraid of her leaving me when I tell her I'm trans and want to transition. I'm only dreading the negative response, I'm very emotional and I know I'll cry a lot."
asktransgender,3e0gmy,omgitsbecky,2,Tue Jul 21 00:28:02 2015 UTC,"sorry, but i agree with you that a lot of the symptoms addressed in that article don't seem particularly gender-dysphoria-specific in my opinion. however...  i think if you consider those things in the context of gender, it can help you decide whether it was dysphoria or depression. and if you're confused still, it's okay, because it's not uncommon for trans people to suffer mental illness in tandem with our identities because of how society at large treats us. i've always found solace, happiness, relief, and confidence in being perceived as male. doesn't even matter how you look, exactly... i recently went out with hair dyed blue and wasn't binding, and i was still addressed as ""sir."" those kinds of moments almost make me forget how hard it is to do simple crap like stay on top of hygiene or work.  so i feel like, if a large part of your discomfort stems from your gender and how others perceive your gender, it may very well be dysphoria or dysphoria-fueled. i feel like ""i wish people saw me as X gender and validated me as such"" would not cross the mind of a depressed person who was not trans or queer in some way.  i'm so sorry if this is rambling, offensive, or unhelpful. good luck!"

Or become an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone!""  That convinced me. I'd rather die young as myself than die as an old man filled with sorrow and regret.

It wasn't until my mid 20s that I didn't identify as male, simply referring to myself as ""a sentient being inhabiting a vessel"". I thought it would be awesome if we didn't even have genitals at all, and could just be androgynous beings. I originally came out as Genderqueer, but that still wasn't enough.  I moved to Oregon and spent a whole year in isolation in 2013. Nobody to bug me, no family to pester me, no distractions. I took that year to really think about all of this, and then one day as I was browsing Tumblr it just dawned on me. The girl inside had kept pushing, saying ""nope! keep going! let me out!"" It was like a bell going off, and I was like, ""this is what I have to do; it's the only thing that makes sense at this point.""    I moved back to Texas shortly after my eureka moment (this is when I came out as Genderqueer), and then a few months later I created a new Facebook account with my new name and gender identifier, came out publicly on my original account (well, with specific people tagged), and began HRT a few months after that.

You could be you, the real you, authentic, and still have half as many followers, half as many people who were completely interested in the real you. Even if you lost that many, over time you can get back to as many followers as you have right now. Even if some people criticize you, you may be surprised at how much support you get from your followers.  Or you could give it up, never let people see the real you and have zero followers left. But if people in your position make that choice, there will be other people in the same position later. You have the ability to help demonstrate to people that you're a great person who for some reason a lot of people have an interest in, and oh, by the way, you just happen to be transgender.  Of course you would rather people think of you as female. I think that's the case for most MTF trans people. Give it time. That's the direction things are moving in socially. The next few decades are likely to have some amazing scientific advancements that we couldn't even think of now(maybe even work toward fertility). And the kids who are being born right now? They will have grown up in a time when trans people were becoming considered regular parts of culture. They won't see the same stigma that older people see.  And if people say that you look like a girl anyway and it's a running joke then your followers will probably react with less negativity than you might see in some places. I think of it as how I haven't come out to my parents but I've left little hints. If it's not official but everyone kind of expects it or believes it then when you do reveal it it won't get as much publicity.  Good luck."

I decided to be open about it, since transitioning and fame would eventually out me - if I ever became newsworthy, it'd take two seconds for it to come out. This way I get to control the message, and this way I also get to use the transition in my work, and it's fantastic.

I'd make a profile (often not stating that I'm trans to avoid harassment) I'd get messages Any conversations would inevitably fail (because finding someone openly into trans people is kinda uncommon) I'd feel defeated and unworthy I'd add that I'm trans to my profile, to avoid any further failure Cue the chasers Delete my profile to avoid further harassment repeat endlessly.   After a while I got sick of it... I've dated a few cool people from dating sites, but generally speaking, sites like that tend to be toxic and any connections tend to be vapid.   However, on the subject of self-hate, the best advice I can give is to treat being trans like it's no big deal. If you stop treating it like the end of the world, or like it's stopping anyone from loving you, then you'll stop seeing it that way.   (I'll admit that sometimes it's still daunting to find love while feeling so removed from society, but the vast majority of days have 0 fucks allocated to caring about how others perceive my gender.)"

Ive been using OKC and its not that bad, you can easily tell and they're not too common  Making it obvious is somewhat nice because dealing with the ""trans conversation"" over and over is not worth it and just makes you feel like crap when things go sideways. People who message you when you're open about it pretty much always don't care and it just lets you have... normal conversations   From my experience you're going to get a lot of bi girls and straight guys depending on your orientation. Lesbians very rarely.  And only really respond to people with actually interesting, long or articulate first messages, that don't mention anything about you being trans."

On OK Cupid, the decent match percentages trend very young.  New England liberal in the Bible Belt here, so the ""younger people are more open minded"" crossover point goes way younger than I'm used to.  I don't have a single match over 90% that I could go drinking with without risking arrest(and being 37, that's young enough to feel creepy even without the drinking issue).  And once it gets  under 90%, there are nearly always at least a couple absolute dealbreakers in the questions, like 'no' to ""Would you date a transgender person"".  Not that this makes them bad people of course(those tend to be much lower than 90%), it's just annoying it's so hard to find someone suitable.  And I'm in a large city, at least by regional standards.  The few other dating sites i've checked out seem to be a bit harder to navigate as a trans person, or the free accounts are so limited it's not even worth the bother of looking in to that.  Tempted to try Craigslist, with a disclaimer ""All unsolicited dick pics will be posted online along with any associated face pics(solicited or otherwise)"" to hopefully scare off some of the crazies there.  Doubt it would do much, but at least their email anonymization can help cover privacy.  Really though, I'm going to have to try to meet people in person.   http://meetup.com is worth a look to see if there are groups covering your interests- might even find trans or general LGBT groups.  Local LGBT centers might have singles nights or other social events that might be worth a look.  Even if you don't find a date, you might find friends.

It's easy to practice concepts that you aren't involved in, but it's harder to practice concepts that are happening to you.  Anyone can say that they will use their power for good if they became all powerful.  But your true self appears when you are asked to practice your beliefs.  Sticking to your beliefs requires immense conviction.  I was taught numerous times in medical school to trust nonverbal communication more than verbal communication.  It's the way they act that will show you who they really are.  They probably just need time to adjust to changes in their life now that you've introduced them.  Give them time..."

They don't want to see you struggle with all the difficulties of being trans, and so they might be doubting your transness because they are afraid that you will be sad because you transition.  My advice is to explain to them about how you are currently feeling about yourself, and that you feel that you must do things (whether it be just wearing clothing you feel happy in, or a hormonal transition ) so that you can be happy.  While it may make sense to you, others in your family may not understand how you feel, and so it is a good idea to explain your feelings to your family so they understand what you are going through."

It turns out that you can't just ""remove"" your gender.  When you first create your Facebook account, you don't have to set it (and FB will just use the gender-neutral pronoun they). But if you've already set it (in my case, to Male), you can't just unset it.   You have to change it to something else or leave it as is. I wanted to remove the ""Male"" from my profile, but I'm not ready to come out as transgender to the whole world yet (either by changing it to Female, or something else)."
asktransgender,3dxg58,andynotandy,3,Mon Jul 20 11:14:07 2015 UTC,"With Facebook, I recently changed mine.  While I don't know of a way to remove it, you can change the privacy settings on your gender independently of other parts of your profile.  So what I did was set the privacy to a specific list I've set up for the people that I'm out to, making my gender invisible to everyone else, and then set it to trans woman."
asktransgender,3dxg58,AnnieBruce,2,Mon Jul 20 12:00:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's more just that I wanted to remove it completely for now. I've already set it to private, but I'm not quite ready to put up Female or trans woman yet (I don't fully trust Facebook's privacy settings not to get borked)."
asktransgender,3dxg58,andynotandy,3,Mon Jul 20 12:12:04 2015 UTC,"part of the reason you can't just remove it is because Facebook needs to know what pronouns to use for you.

asktransgender,3dxg58,lysate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:46:51 2015 UTC,"If you didn't set it in the first place, though, FB just uses ""they/them"" anyway.   I really just wanted it gone altogether.

Plus, seeing as it is still such a small time game, with such a small administration team, I think it was the quickest solution, rather than working in three or four extra options (like ""Trans"" ""Genderqueer"" ""Gender neutral"")  One other little thing they do, which I thought was an interesting touch, is when you create an account (or just a temporary profile if you are a casual player) is that it asks for your sexual preference. The reason for this is because one of the ""events"" in the game is a brothel, and it uses this to make sure the ""Good"" end of that event is in line with what you actually prefer. Options being male, female, and ""I like em all"", which I am fine with, because that would blur the line between ""preference"" and ""Fetish""."

asktransgender,3dyzcp,lysate,3,Mon Jul 20 18:05:30 2015 UTC,I've always found the easiest way to make friends is to go to a group or a meetup of like minded people and just sit and listen. As in introduce yourself and then ask them questions and let them do the talking. If they prompt for you to talk then do so but essentially be a good listener. You will be surprised how many people LOVE when people listen and in turn will think of you as an amazing person to hang around.

asktransgender,3dyzcp,illuminess,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:41:26 2015 UTC,"I've always sucked at making friends, and yet I end up having them. Most I have met online. One of my best friends that I've known since 2005 I met on MySpace after placing an ad seeking musicians. Another great friend I met through him.    As someone with Asperger's, though, my social intuition has always been crap. Plus, I could never relate to any men around me. I always felt out of place, and I wasn't allowed in women's social circles.    Anyway, considering so much of our lives are online these days it's really the best way to get to know people. I've met a few through OkCupid, as I use it primarily for that reason. I've also met a lot of great people through Tumblr. Not yet in person, but they've all been very awesome and I love them.    I'm also 34, have no career, no spouse, no kids, and no car, so many of the people I grew up with have faded into their lives with marriage and having children. I would love to get out more and be social again, but right now I'm trying to get through this transition. I want to be presenting full time so there's less of a chance of being misgendered.    Until then, I just chill here, writing, reading, and helping others like here on Reddit, Tumblr, Facebook and other social networks with transgender groups."

asktransgender,3dzugz,Tsukeira,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:08:57 2015 UTC,"I'd say so, sensitivity hasn't changed. Orgasms are longer rather than being as extreme.   I'd say nipple sensitivity is varied, the nipples and the breast area is kinda painful or sensitive and not really erogenous for me. Skin thins out and becomes more smooth so you feel more, the tissue under the breast and nipple likely becomes more sensitive too."
asktransgender,3dzugz,Tsukeira,5,Mon Jul 20 22:18:26 2015 UTC,"The reasons for not getting SRS/GRS can vary greatly from person to person.    For some, it's simply a lack of genital dysphoria.  Dysphoria is weird, and it's hard to day why some people feel it so strongly and others don't, but that's just how it is.  If you are fin with your downstairs equipment, why should you feel any obligation to change it?    Others may wish they had different equipment, but don't want to go through surgery (which is invasive, expensive, and painful) and/or the subsequent dilation that is required.  And some trans people may have other personal reasons for keeping their genitals.  Hormones don't always result in complete impotency, although they generally make it more difficult to get an erection."
asktransgender,3dzugz,Tsukeira,2,Mon Jul 20 22:37:41 2015 UTC,"But the clue is that someone wants to be a woman, correct? He wants to become a woman and be treated like one.

A guy who loses his penis in an accident is still a guy; similarly, a woman with a penis is still a woman.  I suspect that if it were as simple as taking a pill that magically turned a penis into a vaginal and vice versa, there would be a lot fewer non-op trans people, but the reality is that it's not so simple.  Many trans women would probably elect to undergo a procedure to give them a womb, but it would largely depend on how costly and invasive the procedure would be.  And even if it were cheap and simple, some trans women who have no desire to get pregnant might still elect to not get such a precedure."
asktransgender,3dzugz,Princeso_Bubblegum,0,Tue Jul 21 02:28:36 2015 UTC,"Is that really so hard to comprehend?   Yes it is.  I try to explain where I am comming from:  I'm a (quite straight I think) man. The penis is the ultimate symbol and organ of manliness. It's the thing you penetrate women with. Most men desire that it would be bigger. r/AskWomen is full of men asking things about their dick.  So one does - of course - presume that someone who wants to become a female - what means he wants to get rid of his manliness and achieve femininity - wants to get rid of the penis.  And a lot of trans people seem to want it disappear. While the others are fine with it, masturbate with it...  btw: What are those flags you all are wearing?"
asktransgender,3dzugz,illuminess,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:50:49 2015 UTC,"If you are going to understand this, you need to get over the idea that penis = man, vagina = woman.  Most people see it that way, because men typically have the former and women typically have the latter, but being trans kind of forces one to separate their identity from their physical body, to a degree.  Their penis simply becomes a sexual tool, rather than a symbol of masculinity.  I've even heard some trans women talk about their ""girl penis"".  That's the best way I can think of to describe it; keep in mind that I'm trying to do so from an outside perspective, as I certainly do have genital dysphoria.  The flags are just flair, they represent different things.  Mine is the trans pride flag on the left and the bisexual flag on the right."

Just as there are cis women who don't want children, there are also trans women who don't want children. I, for one, am perfectly okay with not having to deal with things like periods every month since I don't ever plan on having children. I consider it my silver lining of being trans.

No. If you take hormones, erections may be harder to get and they are far more fleeting in length. You can still get them.  Also, even if the penis isn't fully erected, it can still experience pleasurable sensation. You have to remember that its pumped full of estrogen now, it functions a bit differently now.  The best way I can get you to wrap your head around this, is that, effectively, the penis and the clitoris are the same thing here as far as function goes, heck, when transmen go on testosterone, the clitoris grows out."

I'm a amateur-fan of evolution-theory and never saw a good theory why nature could have created homosexuality - not to talk about transgenderism."
asktransgender,3dzugz,nancysbw,3,Mon Jul 20 22:46:48 2015 UTC,"Simply put, evolution only pumped out what is needed for the species to survive long enough to pump out kids on average, that doesn't necessarily mean each person is some super perfect streamlined being. There are, as you probably know, a lot of things in the human body that persist, not because they are useful, but because they don't do harm. Heck, sometimes things that do harm are still kept, because they only become issues after reproductive age.  On homosexuality then, you have to look at the whole species as a whole, rather than the individual. There is some evidence to suggest that homosexuality is tied to genes which encourage the person to have more sex with a greater variety of things. As a thought experiment, imagine a deer with this sex gene, it just fucks everyone without a care, they might have 10 kids or something, which is pretty amazing, however, if one of those kids is gay, then oh well, the gene is going to persist anyway.  Other theories go on about how pretty much, it might not always be in the benefit of the species to have every animal breeding, they can take care of each other's young or just fulfill sexual pleasure.  I imagine 'transgenderism' follows a similar route, as in whatever process which creates us, benefits humanity as a whole, and we are kind the toss out leftovers of the process, although the research into us is pretty new so I can't say anything conclusively."

asktransgender,3dzugz,Anna_the_potato,2,Mon Jul 20 22:59:16 2015 UTC,"It's not black and white. There's a lot of grey. Also, there seem to be three general areas in which trans people suffer dysphoria: social (needing to be seen and accepted for who you are), biochemical (needing the right hormones), and morphological (needing the right body). Different trans people have different levels of dysphoria, with different amounts of each of these types.   Me, I'm fine with my genitals. I want to get rid of my testes. They're in the way, they make it harder to tuck and wear pants, and they make hormone therapy more difficult and high-dose. I won't say I like having what's left of a penis (estrogen changes it and how it functions), but I can cope. If I could wave a magic wand...yeah. I've have a vulva and vagina. But if I had a magic wand, there are a lot of things I'd do in this world. But I don't have a magic wand. I have the option of major surgery,   Things that hold me back: -Would it ever feel like ""me"", or would it always feel like something my doctor constructed? As unsatisfying as I find it to have a penis, at least it feels like part of me.   -Major freaking surgery. Recovery. Pain. Dilating for life. Possible complications.   -I'm 42. I've made it this far. I have a girlfriend who's content to touch me and be eaten out, and we don't have or want penetrative sex. It works for us. Why mess with that?   -Money. Even with insurance, there will be incidental costs. And I don't want to make someone else pay for a surgery that feels elective to me. For others, it's not elective. They really need it for happiness.   -Part of me says that ""real women have a vagina"" is something I've just been told for so long, that I've internalized that. As I get better at accepting that I'm a woman, I have a woman's body, some women have penises, and I and the world need to get over it...I get better at accepting at least that part of me. Having the curves, the hair, and the skin that come with hormones helps me get over the bits I can't (or am not ready to ) change.   You asked about using it for sexual activity. Well, that's where the nerves are, so yes, but I prefer to have it touched or to touch it, and to be touched where my vulva should be. It works for me. I think of it as my clit, and, again, that's enough. The Magic Wand is awesome.   Yes, hormones definitely change nipple sensation. When you take hormones, you get breasts. The real thing. They function...just like breasts. Because they are. And when I'm in the time of month when I'm taking progesterone, they're crazy sensitive."

Not who you responded to but I'm a trans girl (without a tailored birthday suit) dating a straight guy. He was really well informed before we even started dating and was very accepting. He's very attracted to me and I'm no different from any other girl, except for my dysphoria which he helps me through.   Sex is..... difficult. Not because he's not attracted to me, but because I HATE my parts and HATE using them. So we have to work around that. Lately he has been going down on me in the same way he would a cisgirl, in between my legs, which is really nice, it helps my dysphoria a lot.  I also second that some girls have dicks and that society needs to get over it. I am very stealthy. You might see a touch of masculinity but I am never spotted in public, including by my coworkers. I get ma'am, miss, and she in public. I don't see why suddenly learning what parts I have down there would change that. I could have a cute little slit or a massive 8 inch dick or a green alien from mars down there, it doesn't change what you see and what I am on the inside."
asktransgender,3dzugz,RevengeOfSalmacis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:48:56 2015 UTC,"Well, in some ways, it's like being a lesbian in general, in that your dating pool is smaller, just more so. For me, I'm extremely out about the fact that I'm a trans lesbian, and so people potentially interested in me would self-filter a lot. I've seen lots of examples of self-described cis lesbians in relationships with trans lesbians, but I imagine it's certainly harder to get a date.   Ditto for trans women with men. The problem there is that you're dealing with a form of homophobia on one hand that can be really virulent and scary, and if you do get an interested guy, because we tend to be a niche ""fetish"", we're unusually likely to be seen more as a sex object than a person, more a fling than a partner, more an experience than a date. Once in a relationship, because so many people have internalized transmisogyny, we're more likely to be abused or simply taken for granted and teated like crap.  So don't get me wrong, the dating scene for trans women isn't a bed of roses, but I also know plenty of us in great, loving, sex-filled relationships, so it's not a wasteland, either."
asktransgender,3dzugz,boisegang,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:09:19 2015 UTC,"As for nipple stimulation, it's probably possible for some women, not for me. Yes, I'll probably have my testicles removed at some point, but since that makes it harder to create a vagina later, I want to be really, really sure.   Estrogen shrinks the testicles and penis, more the former than the latter. I don't get hard much anymore, and when I do, I'm less hard. Some women continue to ejaculate, but I don't (though I leak a bit of pre-and post-cum).   I'm hard to offend with ignorace, but cruelty or an unwillingness to listen when someone tells you you're being hurtful will set me off fast.   As for your concern that a woman you fell in love with would tell you some time in that she has a penis, well, I think that's pretty unlikely. If there's one thing I can tell you is pretty certain, most of us don't want to get emotionally invested in someone, really starting to fall for someone, and then have them reject you because of something that has been an immense source of pain, suffering and shame in your life (trans ststus, not necessarily genitals). Some women who have had vaginoplasty are ""stealth"" which means they don't tell anyone, but obviously, that's different. A woman with a vaginoplasty has a vagina. Period."

I kept trying to take a new selfie today, and I couldn't get a good angle. I still look enough like a bloke to make me frustrated. I had a bad receding hairline for several years, too, but my E and Spiro has made some of it grow back in. I've been on Finasteride for nearly two months now, too, and I'm starting to feel some soft hairs growing in. I really hope it fills out and becomes terminal enough that I can have a decent hairdo, because I dread the idea of having to wear a wig."

The nerve of it all. :P (goy is a Hebrew term for non-Jewish people)  Anyway to answer your question there is no special strategy. You just do it. You have to be prepared to be confident no matter what she says though.
asktransgender,3dx2lc,Alexis_Melody,2,Mon Jul 20 06:49:17 2015 UTC,"Lol a better fix that. And I guess you have the correct answer here, it's just hard to ""just do it"" when you feel you have so much to lose if things go south. :/"
asktransgender,3dx2lc,Alexis_Melody,3,Mon Jul 20 06:52:19 2015 UTC,Oh I know what you mean. I went through that exact same feeling. As I learned personally there is no halfway measure though. You're either ready and do it or you never do it. There will never be an exact right moment. The right moment is just when you choose to talk with her.
asktransgender,3dx2lc,Emily006,4,Mon Jul 20 06:55:29 2015 UTC,"I was kinda in this same situation but with my dad. He knew just from my mom telling him but he had never spoken to me about it at all and he is pretty right-wing/says bigoted things too.  I was terrified of talking to him because I figured If he wanted to talk he would have. One day though we we're coming back from a fishing trip and we got talking about my past and I just took the chance to segue into the trans* stuff.  It went so much better than I had hoped. He said pretty much that I will always be his child and he will always live me and he just wants me to be happy.  Now I know not everyone is so lucky, but I just wanted to share a positive outcome as well when i finally had the talk."
asktransgender,3dwku5,mbnzpm,4,Mon Jul 20 03:21:00 2015 UTC,"This sounds very similar to my story. I'd always loved girly things, the outfits the makeup the hair looking feminine everything. And as much as I always wished I was a girl, it never occurred to me that I might be transgender until one day when talking about it with a best friend, she asked if I would ever transition. That moment for me was like, a light bulb illuminating inside my brain.   If it's going to make your life better, you should do it. Hurting loved ones is something we all think about, it's inevitable if you have a good relationship with family and friends. Hopefully your dad can see what's really going on: you're trying to be yourself. And that should make him happy, even if he is apprehensive at first. In terms of if this will make you feel more comfortable in your own skin, maybe try small things to make yourself look how you feel. Clothes, hair, binder, act more masculine, etc. See if it all feels right before you decide whether or not to continue and possibly explore HRT etc. Things like this might give you insight on how you think you'd feel if you continued to transition. Therapy is also a good place to start. Lots of us here will offer our best advice, but going to a trained professional would probably do more good than a bunch of us trying to be supportive and helpful.   In any case, I hope everything works out for you. You're not alone in this, there are tons of people that are more than happy to help, even if it's just some emotional support or a place to vent."
asktransgender,3dwku5,trappedinthedesert,4,Mon Jul 20 04:35:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I still haven't come out to my parents yet, and I've been on HRT for almost 6 months now. Started with siblings and they're good, so far.  The thing is, you can't know how the people in your life will react, or if after an initial negative reaction they'll eventually come around - which is possibly the most common response.   There's no rule that says you have to medically transition, but if you think it might be right for you it's worth getting in touch with a gender therapist or local support group. Support groups are very understanding and ideally will help you figure things out no matter what you decide."

asktransgender,3dwku5,phonicparty,2,Mon Jul 20 04:31:06 2015 UTC,"I know post op patient have the highest rate of suicide   This is not true, in fact it's one of the many falsehoods spread by people - religious fundamentalists, terfs, other transphobes with agendas - who try to discredit transition as a valid treatment for dysphoria when the reality is that it's the only treatment for dysphoria that's recognized as being successful by the medical establishment. Suicide rates post-transition are a bit higher than the general population, but significantly lower than pre-transition."

asktransgender,3dwku5,RockerAtFive,3,Mon Jul 20 17:19:51 2015 UTC,"You're very right in that being transgender is not easy. People don't typically wish they were trans. When I first realized I was trans, a large part of me felt I needed to validate my ""trans-ness"" somehow. I felt people wouldn't believe me if I didn't play a certain role. I don't think I was ever embarrassed, but I was very fearful of what others thought of me, especially my family.  Deciding to transition really comes down to you. Do you think this is right for you? Do you think you would be happier in the long run? This decision shouldn't be determined by whether or not you're going to upset other people. Other people aren't going through what you're going through. Your life should not be determined by those around you, no matter how much you care for them.  Some trans people tell a few friends to start using a different name and pronouns before they tell everyone. You can try this out, see how you like it. You could also buy a binder for your chest. I would recommend actually finding a transguy and talking to him. For me that really helped.   In the meantime, head on over to /r/ftm. We're more than happy to have another brother."

I sooo wanted it to be true, but I was sad because I couldn't truly believe it.  I also did not like that it would mean I didn't get to remember having been a boy, I thought it would be awful not to understand who I had been. But I would cling to the possibility that maybe, just maybe, every girl or woman out there did remember a previous life as a boy, but they knew of some reason they were not allowed to talk about it.  It was really my only hope. Well, almost. It seemed more probable than my finding a magic/mechanical teddy bear that performed perfect SRS overnight, though I spent a lot of time thinking that option through. Childhood is a strange time.

asktransgender,3dxajz,transgermany,2,Mon Jul 20 08:23:58 2015 UTC,"What to expect from the Endo.  They will ask you a few questions about your health and if there are major health problems within your Family. (Strokes, Heart diseases so on)  Then they will do some bloodwork to check if eversthing is in order. And of course, to get your levels.   They might give you a prescription right away but most likely they will call you in a couple of days later to talk about your levels and hand a prescription then.   I don't know what else has changed in germany over the past 2 years.  So there is still a possibility you have to do some therapy. Depends on the healthcare provider and of course the current rules which I am not that familiar anymore. (except for the legal name change stuff)   Edit: Oh, forgot about the PM.  I don't think it will cause any problems. Usually when you take soemthing like this they see it is serious and sometimes it even fastens up the things. No need to worry there. :)"

It is not even remotely the same thing as HRT, it can be dangerous, and it's overall just not worth it.  Edit: For the record, it'd make losing weight harder, if, and that's a big if, it was even enough estrogen to overwhelm your testosterone; which is why trans women take an Anti-androgen with estrogen, and why trans men really only need testosterone."
asktransgender,3dy2tz,mygqaccount,3,Mon Jul 20 14:12:24 2015 UTC,"Its not the safest form of estrogen, its synthetic and has more side effects. Plus, it often isn't enough to do much as far as real changes go, its not designed for that use at all.

asktransgender,3dwodu,casualrayet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:18:26 2015 UTC,"Your mention of DnD characters could be a sign already.  Not conclusive on its own, of course, but it could point to something.  Why do you play female characters?  Spend some time thinking about that.  How do you feel about them, compared to any male characters you've played?  The ones that are the closest reflection of yourself, are they male or female?  These questions won't objectively give you an answer, but they are probably a good starting point.  Also, look at characters in other mediums.  On TV shows, for instance, do you identify more with the women or the men?  Why?  If there are exceptions to this trend, why are those characters exceptions?  If the trend is male characters, is it for their traditionally masculine aspects or their traditionally feminine aspects?  An example might be Commander Adama from Battlestar Galactica(which you might not have seen being so young, but check it out)- do you identify with the military commander, or the caretaker?  Either version of the show would work for that question.  There's no purely objective test or question that will give you an answer, and few if any that don't make some reference to traditional gender roles as a standin for identity, but these sorts of questions are a good starting point.  There's no set of answers that are absolute- you could identify with Adama as a military commander over Adama as caretaker, and still be completely a woman.  They're some of the things I contemplated and it did help in figuring myself out."
asktransgender,3dwodu,cakeNeatit2,2,Mon Jul 20 12:17:27 2015 UTC,"I have identified in the past with a few male role models, but they weren't exactly masculine.  Atticus Finch from To Kill a Mockingbird  Jean-Luc Picard from Star Trek: Next Gen.  Ender from Ender's Game  Rigg from Pathfinder(Another book series by Orson Scott Card, guy who wrote Ender's Game)  Non of this characters are really masculine, rather, all are cold and logical, and would be in essence be almost exactly the same if their gender was swapped suddenly.  I guess I play female characters because I really prefer the social dynamic they offer rather than men. All the female characters I've made are very personal reflections of myself and my mental state I would say. Originally I created a female character for an online DnD campaign with a heavy gender imbalance, but now I find myself not wanting to play male characters again.  Off the top of my head, I can think of only a couple minor female role models in media, but when I think about it I've not really had any good male role models in my life. I've not truly identified with them and I feel like that is definitely one factor urging me to make this change."
asktransgender,3dxf7o,moonfollowmehome,2,Mon Jul 20 09:33:48 2015 UTC,"I read 'percussive strumming between paragraphs' as percussive drumming and happened to be eating lunch with chopsticks. Impromptu drumming just happened. :D  Alright, serious stuff. I generally listen to things like metal and rock and the lyrics I enjoy are generally quite dark and heavy as a result. My personal feelings are that uncomfortable subjects (the ones people generally avoid/don't like talking about) have a place, as they are as legitimate as any other subject. These subjects are generally quite important due to the impact they can (death, suicide, etc.) and it saddens me when there isn't much discussion on these topics.  The fact that people think even bringing up the topic is something that shouldn't be done is in itself sad. Whether it be self-censorship or whatever other reason, some people are going to inevitably affected by one of these topics and find there's very little awareness or discussion of what they're going through.  I was abused as a child and throughout my teenage years, sexually and emotionally but never realised due to my lack of knowledge on what abuse could entail. As far as I knew, if it wasn't rape or clear physical abuse, it wasn't abuse. Things might have been drastically different if there had been greater awareness and discussion of such topics.  Myself, I am drawn to lyrics that do discuss such things because I find them validating of my experiences and thus healing to me. A 'yes, this is a thing that happens and it's terrible' goes a long way to reassuring me that I'm not a freak, that my feelings are legitimate and that I'm not alone.  I like these lyrics. Although the details might not be the same, I feel similarly. I don't want to end up a statistic. I'd say go through with using these lyrics."

He was okay with talking about how he figured out he was trans, how his parents reacted, etc. We talked a lot about trans activism.

As such, I'm transitioning to make myself comfortable in this body. For me, not producing sperm sucks, but there are so many children in foster care that are abused that it doesn't bother me. If I ever decide to become a parent, I plan to adopt or my spouse and I will get a surrogate. At the end of the day, I could've been born cis with ambiguous genitalia, or no penis, or a dysfunctional reproductive system. How would I have seen myself then? My life is about being comfortable in my body. Yes, it sucks and maybe life means nothing, but for me, I feel I want to experience a lot more things before dying and transitioning will allow that.

People see me as a man and I can see myself as a man and that's what matters to me. On testosterone I am going through male puberty, just as I would have earlier in life had I been born male.

Some women have fragile X which means they can't bear children. There are many variations and with few exceptions people who have those variations are still considered real men and real women. A friend of mine recently found out his sperm count is nearly zero and he can't have children. He is still a man. Being make does not hinge on a chromosome pattern or on the gametes you produce. Sex is not a FACT: sex is a reflection of society's desire to categories people into two groups.

I mean, a lot of people think that there are only ""men"" and ""women"" (and the ""rest"" if they know intersexual people) because they want to see the world like that. But in reality sex is not binary but a spectrum and ""nature"" doesn't care about following their (too) simple conception of sex. So on what basis do they classify some characteristics as ""male"" or ""female""? Gender.   Transphobe are kinda hypocrite sometimes : they say we are delusional and deny the objective reality (no, we don't) but meanwhile they want us to stick with their ""objective"" and ""true"" binary conception of sex.

All that does is cause the gonads to produce testosterone, which basically accounts for all the other physiological changes that take place during pregnancy. When It comes down to it, the production of testosterone is the only thing that differentiates the male assigned from the female assigned, at least in situ. The chromosomes themselves are largely unimportant, and the SRY gene is not nessacarily present only on the y chromosome. Additionally, any number of other factors could cause hormone fluctuations during development. Elderly cis men and smokers tend to lose their y chromosomes in most of their cells, as it is the chromosome most likely to mutate. They are still considered men."

Many of the trans people I've talked to when getting into the details have a more nonbinary or semi fluid identity. It's just that there's a general label that fits. I know it's this way for me. I go by trans woman because it is the closest match to how I present myself and am comfortable. Do I. Actually think I'm a woman though? No. What I am is much more complex and there is no label that truly describes me.   Maybe you won't be a man as you envision men, but you can be more comfortable with your body. You can be more comfortable with how the world sees you. And honestly, you can be a man, even if it's not the stereotypical definition of one.   Remember we have re purposed gender to explain ourselves, but gender is a social construct. That not to say gender, and the intrinsic feelings that let us figure out who we are, isn't real. Those things are real. It's just the concept of sex that we have, and which gender is based off of, was defined by a group of white European men a long time ago. As Audrey Lord said, ""the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house.""  So tear down the concept of gender and recreate it. Create a new concept of gender that fits you and let's you be comfortable. If the definition of man isn't one that you feel let's you be a part of it, then screw that definition. Make a new definition of man that let's you have a space. That's the real power of the trans movement. We are creating definitions that let us have space and be heard. So you are a man because that what you are comfortable identifying as, and fuck any definition that doesn't see you as who you are.  Also my parents were similar in borrowing money from me. In the end I had to lie to them about what I made and my expenses so I could save and plan for hrt when I moved out. It sucks having to lie, but in these situations sometimes you have to so that you can take care of yourself.   When it comes to name, you can get it changed. You can also petition many schools to retroactively change your name and give you a new certificate so that it doesn't cause problems.  Hope isn't lost for you. It's just delayed, but it's there. You can become yourself. It just might take moving out to accomplish that. It'll be a hard few more years, but you have such life ahead of you. Trust me the future is worth it. Things change. With persistence and work you can make it change for the better for yourself. As someone who clawed my way from the lowest economic bracket to middle class, it can be done. Transition is possible your future, and so is a whole new life that is radically different than your current life.  sorry if that wasn't clear, I just got back from a party and I'm not in the most sober state of mind."
asktransgender,3dzzx6,tridentloop,3,Mon Jul 20 22:16:08 2015 UTC,"I think competitions and such that complain about trans athletes having an advantage just don't know much about hrt and its effects. Losing all that muscle, strength and having hormones drop or raise to female levels changes almost every working thing in the body.  Yes in the beginning they might have had an advantage but that disappears after a long while on hormones."
asktransgender,3dzzx6,Wildernessinabox,3,Mon Jul 20 22:24:34 2015 UTC,"The ""rules"" such as they are widely vary depending on the level of competition, where you live, and so on. The group you're most interested in is transgender women (women who were assigned male at birth). In the US in K-12, it depends on what state you're in. California says you can compete in the gender you identify and consistently live as. Other states say you have to have had genital surgery (which is pretty damned unlikely for a minor). I'd like to see K-12 go to the California standard. The very small number of trans people isn't going to change the nature of these amateur sports. Everyone should have a chance to play.   At the college, semi-pro, and pro levels (including the Olympics), the standard is generally a certain number of years (usually 1, 1.5, or 2) on female hormones and sometimes genital surgery. Most medical experts say that a year of hormones without genital surgery is enough to make trans women (women assigned male at birth) and cis women (women assigned female at birth) functionally equivalent in most sports. Given that overwhelming medical opinion, I'd like to see the times tightened up to allow athletes to play with minimal restrictions, and to not require major surgery."
asktransgender,3dzzx6,nancysbw,2,Mon Jul 20 23:06:27 2015 UTC,"I should point out that trans women who have had two years of hormones and genital surgery have been eligible in the Olympics since 2008, and no trans woman has competed in the Olympics yet."

asktransgender,3dzzx6,33peace,3,Mon Jul 20 23:25:10 2015 UTC,"Most (all?) guidelines stipulate that you cannot start HRT until you are 16. Prior to that you can take puberty blockers, which as the name implies, prevents the effects of your natural puberty."
asktransgender,3dzzx6,nancysbw,2,Mon Jul 20 23:57:05 2015 UTC,"Usually, if a trans kid has both parental and doctor support, they can go on puberty blockers ar the start of puberty, and hormones as early as 16 (of course, this varies). A large number of trans people don't figure out that they're trans until later...14....18....25....40...85...and so wouldn't necessarily be on hormones yet. It can take up to a year to get started. So say you're 15, and played on the guys' soccer team in your state your freshman year...in a state that said you needed two years of hormones, you'd be in therapy and evaluation your sophomore year, you'd be on hormones your junior and senior year, and you'd never be able to play on the women's team. In an enviroment that only cost you six months of therapy and evaluation, and only a year on hormones, you would be able to play your senior year, and that would be pretty special. In a place that said, ""she's a kid, she's a girl, she's starting hormones, just let her play"", she might even get two years, and by the end of it be really accepted by her team, and have a wonderfully supportive experience. I'd want that for her.   In the Olympics, no, there are no known examples of a trans athlete competing (though intersex athletes have) in their true gender. The current guidelines that allow for it have been in place since 2008, but either there has been too much transphobia, trans women/men are at too much of a structural disadvantage, or some combination of both. We won't really know until time passes, and we're able to see trans people competing openly in sports, but initial indications sure seem to suggest that the fears of, ""trans women will take women's sports away from 'real [cis] women', aaaaaugh"" seem utterly overblown."
asktransgender,3dzzx6,sayoneko,5,Tue Jul 21 15:27:00 2015 UTC,"Specifically men identifying as women?   Uh... wow. If you mean trans women, that was just about as offensive as you could possibly be.  That aside, the reason men and women have separate athletic divisions really comes down to testosterone. It gives a huge advantage to those who have it over those who don't, hence the need for a separate division for those who don't.  Trans women have less testosterone than cis women, since the latter produce a small amount of it with their ovaries (not as much as men produce with their testes, but some), whereas trans women lack ovaries. They may or may not still have testes, but those who do are also on anti-androgen meds (e.g. spironolactone) that nuke their testosterone levels to well below the level cis women have. Thus, they're at a bit of a disadvantage."

asktransgender,3dzzx6,IcarusofMine,2,Mon Jul 20 23:10:08 2015 UTC,"Correct. You're trans when your gender identity doesn't match what you were assigned at birth, and you're cis when they match.

asktransgender,3dzzx6,Aisren,2,Tue Jul 21 19:35:41 2015 UTC,Totally fine with it. Trans athletes generally have no advantage with the caveat they are on HRT.

asktransgender,3dzzx6,IcarusofMine,0,Mon Jul 20 22:22:17 2015 UTC,"Trans women, or women who are a gender minority and assumed male at birth who transition to biologically align their bodies and minds have no physical advantage. Actually, medical reports and science reports say the opposite: a biological disadvantage. The testosterone level is abysmally low, and the bones are weaker. The notion of a well defined male and female and that they are fixed is only assumed true because the majority is that way. Upon deeper scientific inspection, neither is there a well defined male and female, nor a fixed-state exist in the human's sex."

asktransgender,3dxaoh,throwawayandparanoid,3,Mon Jul 20 08:26:16 2015 UTC,"In my experience, there's two types of differences in transition outcomes: great/good/bad/awful social transitions, and great/good/bad/awful medical transitions.   Yes, waiting five years will downgrade your medical transition.   Waiting five months will not.   Waiting five months will probably massively improve your social transition (from having ""figured this shit out"").   Waiting five years will probably not (beyond those first months).  The figuring shit out phase moves a lot faster than people expect. Before you know it, you've figured out what you want, talked to a therapist, come out to everyone, chosen a name and want hormooooooones noooooooow! Everyone else is trying to slow you down, wondering whether you've ""thought this through"", and you're thinking, ""only 24 hours a day for the last three months, yes I've thought this thrrough!""  So take your time. Yes, there's a big advantage to starting earlier, medically speaking, but that time scale operates in much longer units than actively processing the questioning. 21 vs. 22 vs. 23 are relatively minor differences compared to the benefits of working through your own internal issues, coming out at a non-forced pace, and really feeling good and well grounded in your decisions."

asktransgender,3dwn4o,DepartureOfLight,13,Mon Jul 20 03:42:44 2015 UTC,"I think this all has to do with social conditioning. Being transgender is a huge taboo. It's something that we're taught is unacceptable, but at the same time, we just are.  So people have the desire to have sex. It's a normal human thing.  Combine those three things:   Transgender person who perceives the world as someone of the opposite sex and wants to deal with the world as such The desire to have sex Being told that you can't act on your feelings of being transgender   To me, it seems inevitable that they will be combined.  And to make it even more ingrained, you start to associate orgasm with those stories in particular, and this reinforces itself as time goes on. It's like Pavlov's dog, with the bell.  And it's laughably described as the cause of being trans, rather than what seems much more obvious, that it's a symptom of being trans and of being in a society which tells people they can't be trans. I expect that as being transgender becomes less and less taboo that it will also lessen as the very specific fantasy that it is.  There should be no guilt in this. It's not like a fetish for hurting other people. In fact, this  particular thing is about the least outwardly dangerous sexual activity anywhere, because it generally involves reading and impossible events. There are no ""porn stars"" for abuse accusations or to get infected with anything, and it's not like you're going to go out and actually inflict something on other people after reading. How would that even work? And there's nothing wrong with being a woman. If you could press a button to give yourself a perfect female body and have no male features, would you do it? So why is it somehow degrading to fantasize that someone else be forcing you to do something you'd do of your own free will and that you actually really really want to do? The only degrading thing is being told that you can't do it, and that's not your choice. That's a situation that others force on you. Right now, there are others that are forcing you not to hit that metaphorical button. That should be their guilt.  As for relating it to genital dysphoria, I think the simplest immediate solution is to try to understand that the situation you're in is temporary, and to deal with the problem first thing in the morning so that you don't think about it again for the rest of the day."
asktransgender,3dwn4o,justansweringthis1,3,Mon Jul 20 05:57:13 2015 UTC,"I just want to add that although it is perfectly reasonable to experience these feelings. It is probably best to not tell the average person about them, they probably won't understand like we do.   And well in my personal experience it does make it harder to tell if I'm attracted to women, because I get into the whole mode of wanting to be them, and wanting to be sexier, and that feeds this kink. And in me it's just a kink not a true fetish thankfully."

There is a reason men typically develop more fetishes and kinks than women, and it's not because they are sick or twisted. Just their sex drives and how the mind forms associations.

asktransgender,3dwn4o,omgitsbecky,2,Mon Jul 20 05:35:19 2015 UTC,"You have no idea how much me this was when I was 16. From 12 years old up until 17 1/2, I felt the exact same way. It was the ONLY thing that would get me off. It's still the only thing that gets me off really, although now I just prefer to not have a sex drive because dysphoria and wrong parts and all that stuff I'm sure you know as well.   The only thing I have to say is recently I've been working towards accepting myself more, and, because of that, trying to just be feminine mentally 100% of the time. And after a while of doing this, I've slowly been starting to go through what I call the beginnings of my ""female puberty"". I've noticed that as I become more comfortable with seeing myself as a female and just existing as a girl (I just tell myself I don't know what I'll look like after transition so I can't dwell on the fact that I look like a guy and have guy parts), I've started to slowly get random flashes of horniness in which I'm, in my mind, lusting (horny) or loving as a female. Which is actually comfortable and not the roller coaster of emotions that anything sexual as a male is (during those denial periods). And while I used to only be into being forcibly feminized, now that I'm viewing myself as a woman mentally more I don't really care about being forcibly feminized cus the part of forced feminization that really used to do it for me was when there was a forced mental change and it was like the entire male person had been erased. But now that I don't really have to hide behind the excuse of being forcibly feminized, because I've accepted for myself that yes I need to transition and I want to be a woman and not a brain-dead sissy doll, I've been able to overcome hiding behind the excuse of ""well if it's forcibly feminized then it's not my fault for wanting to feminize myself so that I can be a woman and happy"".   So at least in my case, and I'm still working very hard mentally to stay accepting of myself 100% of the time, the liking of forced feminization kinda dropped off when I was able to accept that this is who I am and what I want and this is me (a female) and I don't need to be forced to do this for it to be acceptable because it's okay that I want this.   16 year old me thought I would never be able to escape this fetish. I felt kinda trapped to be honest because I realized it was close to what I wanted but not completely. I wanted to be a woman deep down and not a sissy. There's a huge difference, and I'm sure you know what I mean (at least I hope you do, maybe I'm just not making any sense at all... But I hope that my experience and knowledge connects with something or is some help.) I was horny every day, horny multiple times a day... I was a little sex crazed fiend. And I realize now that's because I felt so off all the time and dysphoric (even though I didn't know that's what it was at the time) that I was using the fetish as a break from the male life. I knew subconsciously that if I wanted to feel feminine or feel like I was reading a feminine mindset (I used to like captions idk about you), and I couldn't get off to anything else because deep down I am female and having a female mindset during sex kinda helps... A lot... Especially when your transgender.   I'm only 18 btw, and I just turned 18 in the past two months, so don't worry. It fades with growing up and coming into yourself. You just gotta work to get past feeling so disgusted at yourself for having this fetish in the first place, because it's not that abnormal. You still have the body of a male, and makes are horny and have high libidos. I'd go so far as to say that they're physical beings more compared to women who are more mental (especially during sex). So the fact that you need that extra help to get that female mindset to the surface isn't bad or make you lesser, it's quite normal and just where you are right now. It'll change, you'll start to accept yourself more as you experience more and realize that yeah I'm definitely sure I need to transition (in my experience at least I flipped between ""I want to transition but I'm not sure if that want is just from my fetish and maybe I'm brainwashed/hypnotized or 'sissified' deep down"" and yeah I'm a female not a sissy I do kinda wanna transition and not just be a sissy even though that seems so taboo and socially unacceptable."

To me it's kind of well like ""uhh duh?"" but I guess to my mom, because she was my ""husband"" first, she'd always be my husband unless I said otherwise? I don't know. Things just don't always click or align in some people's minds I guess.  I certainly understand why you're hurt by that though. Just talk to her and hopefully she'll understand."

And if that's not the case, it's probably not malicious in any way.  Even if she got the card after you came out, the thought process of people on the outside is ""you are currently male. Soon you won't be."" Not the view that you were female the whole time, and soon your body will match. it's a very common train of thought, and I try not to fault people for it.  With that in mind, the intent was probably a lot more along the lines of ""Oh, this will make sun-loves-moon know that I'll always be there!"" it was probably more of a ""you're my sibling and always will be"" more than emphasis on not seeing you as female.  Someone that is willing to assist financially of their own volition isn't going to be someone that insists you aren't truly female. Try not to let it get to you."

Also she did say that it is going to take time to get used to it a d even if she hadn't said that a pronoun shift is weird for everyone at first especially pre and early hrt and when the person isn't out to many people."

asktransgender,3dv5fp,Wannabkate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:54:49 2015 UTC,"I might be sugar coating this, but referring to someone as your brother or bro is often a form of familial endearment.  Alternatively, maybe she does still see you as her brother?  There's nothing wrong with that.  The bonds you made together is still strong with her, and she'll always endear you as family... as a brother.  It's a tricky situation, but I highly doubt that she means any kind of maliciousness here.  If you have a problem with it, you might want to talk to her about it... but don't misunderstand your sister's love for you.  Sometimes, in order to be understood, you must understand as well.  You are her dear brother... not a man... not a woman... but family.  And she probably chose that one to try to say something along the lines of always being there for you as a sister no matter what.  At least, that's how I see the poetry of the card.  I hate premade cards to be honest... you can never find one that states the message you actually want to say."

So imagine how simple it'd be to gain the correct body parts or hormone levels or whatever.   I don't imagine there are a huge number of trans people at Hogwarts, but I'm sure if a student ever came across that problem, Dumbledore would sort it out and ensure that the person is able to be in the correct dormitories."

asktransgender,3dv56p,Stone_Crowbar,2,Sun Jul 19 23:33:42 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind Crabbe and Goyle in Book 6 gained the appearance and voice of younger schoolgirls and Hermione in the book 7 gained the appearance and voice of Harry, both through the polyjuice potion (note that they were still their own person even with those changes, regardless of the similarity in appearance).  Even if a gender potion didn't exist, and the room of requirement or some other part of the HP universe/hogwarts didn't have something in it that let people changed genders, a person could at least take polyjuice and have the appearance and voice of someone whose appearance matched their gender identity, as long as they kept making more of the potion. So even using cannon potions, its 100% doable.  The awkward part would be who you take the appearance of, since you would become their identical twin. It would be great if you had a sibling with the appearance you identify with close in age, since you could just be them and get a new haircut to differentiate the two of you. Still as a long term solution it would create the new problem of learning to live in another person's body with new hormones and such. Transitioning through HRT and other methods in some ways is for the better that it is gradual, since it gives us time to adjust to the changes that come with transitioning. A sudden change would cause a lot of necessary adjustment by comparison. I'm actually looking forward to seeing if my guess is true when, some day, transitioning can be done in less than a month rather than over years of painful changing..."

asktransgender,3dv56p,Give_me_bewbs,2,Mon Jul 20 20:29:02 2015 UTC,"I think this could make a great story, overlooking the slow physical aspects of transitioning, and focussing on the way it is perceived in the wizzarding world.  Imagine it, in the first act the character is introduced, and plans to steal ingredients for a potion from Snape's lab.  Act 2, the character is caught, and brought to Dumbledore's office to explain their attempted theft. Dumbledore then calmly takes the matter from Snape's hands and properly talks to the student, as they explain themselves.  Act 3, character given weekly doses of a potion that will slowly reverse their gender, given to them weekly by a sneering Snape under Dumbledore's orders. This could be used to explore gate keeping and institutionalised trans phobia.  Act 4, character is under a charm to appear as their former selves to students until they are comfortable. Character adjusts to physical changes, slowly grows to accept self and grows to resent the charm.  Act 5, big trouble, events at the school lead to the character losing the charm concealing their appearance in public. Ridiculed for the act, and either avoided or abused by pupils, the character loses their progress, slipping into a depression and avoiding contact with students. Maybe they even cease taking their weekly potion. (I like the idea of Snape coming and telling the to character drink the potion, then pouring it down the drain in front of them. The character's reaction, and Snape's future actions could massively advance the emotional state of the story)   Act 6, the character is forced into confrontation, and barely emerges, hurt both emotionally and physically. The character learns to accept self, and confronts Snape, resuming their potion usage.  (I like the idea of Snape having kept a cupboard of them spare)  Ok, I may have gone a bit overboard here, but I really like this idea."

If you're not going to include GSM stuff then that's fine, but don't try and pretend afterwards to make yourself seem more in tune with current views.  If there were any transgender people I'd reckon they'd just take a polyjuice potion until the age of 18 at which point they got permanent transformation.

I cannot help but OTP Kojuurou/Masamune hard with all that I know about the historical figures' real lives (they were lovers in real life, but you know how anime likes to pretend Homosexuality In Ancient Japan Wasn't A Thing). I love that series.  Kyuuketsuki Hime Miyu-- A vampire drama that I actually enjoy! Miyu and Larva are such fascinating characters, and I really enjoyed the mix of servant/paramour angle that went on with regards to Miyu's feelings for Larva, and vice versa.  Sekirei--Ehh, it doesn't take genius to figure out why I enjoy the fight-until-all-our-clothes-fall-off battles, but I was pleasantly surprised at how serious the stakes were for an anime that so heavily relies on fanservice. Combine that with a character that is stuck very confusingly on the middle of the gender spectrum? I was sold.  Count Cain--This is the manga that the creator of Black Butler/Kuroshitsuji pretty much ripped off entirely, and it's a much superiour story.  Haikyuu!!--I ship it. I ship it hard. Pick a couple from there? I ship it.  Free!--I also ship it. I ship it hard.  Durarara!!--A little hard to get into, but I love the character designs and story elements.  Dance In The Vampire Bund--Strange little anime, but very good.  Yoroiden Samurai Troopers--Back in the mid 90's, this was one of the first animes I ever got super into."

My best friend growing up was a girl, and she hated dolls. We ran around fighting invisible baddies, creeping each other out thinking we see weird aliens and creatures in windows and the woods, and played with Ninja Turtles. None of those things stopped me from going into the bathroom and putting on makeup and posing. Identity runs deeper than what you're into or how you present yourself. You know who you are, and that's all that matters."

But, thinking back, I remember being told off for feminine behaviour when I was young. I think my folks are more in denial than I was.  Maybe you can remember something similar?  Or maybe there is some kind of way you rejected male behaviour (like refusing to play male sports or something)  Maybe even you were unusually well behaved for a male child and hated it when the boys pulled the wings off insects. :(  Anyway, it doesn't really matter; typical masculine or feminine behaviours are mostly just stereotypes/social constructs."

Your mom doesn't want you to be a girl and is more than likely projecting her desire in the form of her opinions about your ""feminine traits"".  Even my mom said she didn't consider herself ""feminine"" and yet she still brought that up as a talking point for being a woman.  She won't stop until she's used to you being a girl.

asktransgender,3dvucr,CrumblyButterMuffins,4,Sun Jul 19 23:24:06 2015 UTC,"There are trans women who are very masculine, it doesn't mean they're not trans. So if you're not cis, it's no big deal if you're happy in the clothes you're wearing, having a beard, etc. It doesn't change how you feel.  You do sound genderqueer. You can try to find a more specific label you feel comfortable with, but sometimes there isn't a word specific enough for such a fluid thing. Sometimes you feel male, sometimes you feel female, sometimes you feel somewhere in-between. That's cool, that's just you. And if you're comfortable with your body and with the clothes you wear and whatnot, that's cool, too. Your outside doesn't need to reflect what society thinks you should look like. By that I mean, if you feel like a woman one day but still have your beard and male name and etc., who cares? As long as it doesn't make you uncomfortable, it's no big deal, it's just something you feel about yourself, and that's all that matters."
asktransgender,3dvucr,HippieSoulPunx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:59:09 2015 UTC,"I have a friend who identifies as gender non-conforming or non-binary. She was male assigned at birth, goes by female pronouns but doesn't belong to either gender. She wears dresses but also has a big orange beard. For her, and a lot of people who are trans or gender non-conforming, gender is not either male or female, it's a big web of qualities and attributes and you can pick and choose which ones you want.   And keep in mind that a lot of things that we think are designed for one gender or the other are just social constructs. There are lots of men who wear dresses and women who don't. Hell, there are lots of women with penises or men with vulvas. The point I'm getting at is that you don't have to put yourself into a box or pick any kind of label you don't feel comfortable with. There are a million genders you can pick from, hell, you could make your own if you really wanted. You don't need to know everything about what you are, but be happy with who you are as a person and everything else will follow."

asktransgender,3dudl0,4riadn3,6,Sun Jul 19 16:55:02 2015 UTC,I lurked your submissions because I'm a creeper. I don't think you'll have issues passing. You look your age and will likely look even younger once Estrogen does it's job. You have very soft features.
asktransgender,3dudl0,ZelkyZo,3,Sun Jul 19 16:57:05 2015 UTC,"Agree.  It's probably certain features thrown together that create an appearance of age.  That said if after a year or two on HRT, I would be shocked if you somehow didn't pass."

I'm 35 and went to a college graduation where someone asked me if I was graduating.  Keep in mind though that a lot if us dress young, probably as a way of establishing an identity that we didn't get to establish.

Then I looked in the mirror and I felt happy, I felt comfortable.   I had that exact same experience. I remember vividly how much I couldn't stop smiling when I saw my reflection. It's amazing, right?   I think we're all really scared when we come out, about how our friends and family will react. You know them more than any of us do, but in my own experience, I didn't give people anywhere near enough credit. The people who I thought I was essentially saying goodbye to, an extremely active Christian couple in Mississippi for instance, actually sent me private messages of love and support.   I'm not sure that's what you'll get, but I do think you'll be surprised in more good ways than bad.  I bought my clothes through Amazing Prime at first (mostly still), returning stuff is easy. Some websites are better than others, ModCloth for instance has amazing sizing charts and huge community support in regards to that.   I told my close female friends and exes first. It was a comfortable way to ease my way into that process. I didn't come out ""publicly"" until I had been on HRT for 4 months or so. The weight that was released from then on was extremely liberating.   You've gotta feel pretty awesome after making this post too I hope. Every new step is a big step."

For me it was the hardest to talk to my parents or my brother as this were the poeple I feared rejection the most.   But it is possible.  If you can't get you to speak to them, you can prepare a letter for them explaining you situation.  Be present when they read it. It might be an awkward feeling but you don't have to worry about just sit there stuttering nonsense.   And just after you did it, get on blockers. You can talk to your GP about, they might be able to prescribe it. Should be possible without your parents consent as with 18 you're an adult in terms of the law in the Netherlands.

It sure would beat having more permanent damage be done to my body, but I don't think people here really understand that yet. :/  Thanks~  -Laura"

Blockers just block and don't do anything irreversible.  If your GP knows your family for a while it might help if your parents put some pressure on them.  If that doesnt't help then try everyone who is able to prescribe medication.  Someone will do.

asktransgender,3dvoqk,Fairlady31,3,Mon Jul 20 21:32:29 2015 UTC,"My parents were similar in that they definitely knew something was up and talked about loving me no matter what. I actually just came out to them a couple days ago.  I wrote a letter while sitting in the same room as them, printed it on the family printer, told them to give me thirty seconds to run away before they looked at it, and locked myself in my room. I ended it with asking them to give me space until the next morning, but they could text me or something if they wanted to say anything before then. (It was after dinner when I finished writing it.)(Edit add: I didn't tell them what it was about first. Just said ""Here, have a thing, let me go hide now."")  Giving it to them that way meant I couldn't take it back, but I didn't have to try and stay coherent through an explanation. It was easier to write a letter in my voice to them while they were in the room because I could just imagine I was actually speaking to them, without having to actually do it. I left a lot of that out of the initial letter to keep it brief and not overwhelm them, even if they were expecting it. In my drafts I rambled a lot, and even that's helped because it gave me an idea of how I can actually respond to some questions.  I wrote a story once, where a girl had two gay dads who completely botched the whole growing up Talk, and she knew it. So she left post it notes on the bathroom mirror with any questions she had, so they'd have time to research or compose a response. I'm considering instating that in my own life because it's more personal than a text or email, but still leaves some space in the conversation.  My parents have taken it well so far, mostly. I have a few reservations about how okay my mom really is with it, and my dad seems to think I'm a bit of a coward for being afraid, but they're trying. (My dad: ""Your grandparents friends have a transgender kid and everyone's cool with her, so you know how my family reacts to things. If you've known for so long, why didn't you say something sooner?"" Me: ""Um, I have never met or heard any such things about G&G's friends. How am I supposed to know how you'll react again?"")"

I feel like what your dad's doing right now pretty much shows he's 100% cool with it, or at least from what I gathered from the little I know, and it sure beats other stuff that could've happened. I'm sure your mom is OK with it too!  Writing a letter is what I think I'll probably do, because it really does seem like the best idea. Complete / personal explanation while not having to awkwardly explain it myself. Also, I love the post it note idea! Although that's not quite viable for me because I have a crazy sister going about. Sounds better than having to ask my mom how bras work in person. x_x That's gonna be fun. Probably do that with a text message or something..  Thanks for your reply~  -Laura"

I also realized a bit ago that with my mom, it might not be her having reservations so much as the fact that she has a large family and is trying to figure out what to say to them.  And I have a sister too! Although she's not very crazy... Okay, she kinda is, but mostly in a good way. Coming out to her was a lot easier than my parents, because she actually asked me if changing my name had anything to do with gender. While we were at work (we work in the same place), on a very busy day, so there was no room for over thinking for either of us. There was a yes, a hug, and then back to work we went."

I am 100% certain I would have been happier being born female than male. But I am not all unhappy. I do value the gift of life even if it was into the wrong body and life has allowed me to experience a lot of really cool things.   Now I am a little different in that I have always been attracted to women. Problem I have is that when a cis-male man sees a woman he is attracted to his thoughts are ""I want to be with her"" whereas my thoughts are ""why couldn't that have been me"". I have tried being in relationships with women hoping that they would cure me (of course there is no cure). But it was hard being in relationships where I was expected to be the man when internally I am a girl. I never had the guts to tell any of my girlfriends my true feelings (I am also older than most around here and grew up in a different era). So yeah I am similar in that I am jealous of women but different in that I am attracted to women, but it was hard being in relationships when I wanted to be the girl in the relationship when I was expected to be the man. :/"

After like 6~8mo HRT, I was (and still am) struggling to get 50lbs lifted.  Sure I could work on that, but meh.  You'll loose it in the arms, shoulders, chest, back.  Some in the legs.  You'll loose some around the shoulders, and that'll make them look a bit smaller, but just figure out how to accept them being wide.  There's other girls out there with wide <something>."
asktransgender,3dvbf6,maleia,2,Sun Jul 19 20:48:52 2015 UTC,"It's going to be a lot.  I was a rock climber for a number of years, and always maintained that shoulder muscle.   Even when I was 50 pounds heavier, I was always able to do 10 pull ups.  I've lost 35 pounds since starting HRT in March(I had lost 15-20 the previous year), and while some of that was fat, I can only manage 2 pull ups now.  The muscle loss is very real, and very intense.  I've still got ways to go, but it takes time."

asktransgender,3dvbf6,ZelkyZo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:49:01 2015 UTC,Totally know how you feel. My neck is thicker than I'd like but seems to have a lot of room to shrink. My shoulders feel pretty boney when I touch them so I worry nothing will happen.
asktransgender,3dvbf6,ZelkyZo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:28:39 2015 UTC,"I hope so too, because I remember my neck not being nearly as thick and I have a hard time believing the thickness is due to bone differences.  Shoulders wise I have some bony areas but the area where I'm hoping for shrinkage the most is near where my arms start and it feels far more fleshy in that general area.  I'm hopeful!

For reference, I was a very very active rock climber, and at 5'8 I was weighing in at 145-150 lbs. I was skinny and super fit with a very low body fat content. I'm still the exact same way (maybe a bit more body fat now), and I've lost a ton of weight. In the last few (7-8) months I've dropped 15-20 lbs. I now vary from 127-130. I havn't been this low since like, the start of high school when I wasn't too active in sports that developed a lot of muscle."
asktransgender,3dtshe,throwawayyImao,31,Sun Jul 19 11:39:15 2015 UTC,"Wanting to be trans and being trans are essentially the exact same thing - barring a few cases of more severe mental instability (mild OCD is not a culprit, and neither is depression).  Believe it or not your story isn't all that uncommon, so among trans people you aren't alone in your desire. One form of dysphoria is an intense envy of your identified gender. Another is the desire to change to that gender.  And it's not uncommon to be unable to actually say the thought ""I am ___"" out loud and have it feel right for awhile. After all, you've been forced into a gender for quite some time by circumstance for years.  All that being said, my advice is pretty standard - seek out therapy, but try to find a professional who has experience working with trans people and gender identity issues."
asktransgender,3dtshe,Artemis_in_Exile,13,Sun Jul 19 11:54:46 2015 UTC,"One form of dysphoria is an intense envy of your identified gender. Another is the desire to change to that gender.   I have had both of these for quite a long time. Sometimes I feel okay (not good, but bearable) about being male I guess, other times I can't think of anything else other than how I would rather have been simply born female, and can get very envious (of both cis and post-transition transgirls).  I guess I should look into telling my parent/s how I feel and seeing a therapist about it."
asktransgender,3dtshe,Thrw2367,6,Sun Jul 19 12:07:12 2015 UTC,"Just to head off future questions: yes dysphoria ebbs and flows. It's not like it needs to be in the forefront of your mind at all times.  Also be careful with the folks. I don't know your situation but some parents take it really badly.

asktransgender,3dtshe,SharpAtTheEdge,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:12:28 2015 UTC,It is very similar in my current experience
asktransgender,3dtshe,davesfakeaccount,6,Sun Jul 19 19:39:58 2015 UTC,"Do you know about gender euphoria? It is sort of the opposite (or compliment to) gender dysphoria.  For example, when I'm presenting as female and people are using the correct name and pronoun it feels really good.  This is, perhaps, another way to look at things.  Because there is a big difference between ""being male is not so bad, I could live like this"" versus ""in this moment, I feel so very happy and so very RIGHT"".  Your experience resonates with me, because I too have moments where I don't really mind being male all that much. Personally (and this is only my experience) this often happens when I'm alone, probably because my social dysphoria is far worse than my physical dysphoria. Not that I love my male-appearing body or anything it is just that I hate being called sir/receiving male pronouns so much more. And, yes,  even that ebbs and flows.  I think there are some things for you to untangle. There is the question of ""What is my gender identity?"" and there is the question of ""What do I want to do about it?""  There is, perhaps, a certain tautology to transgender identity. No one can tell you that you are trans...it is just something you know/come to learn about yourself.  A person is trans because they feel like they are trans. There is, in a sense, some ""circular reasoning"" at play. Perhaps, in the future, people will get blood tests or brain scans to determine if they are ""really trans"". Or, perhaps not. But, today, the question can only be answered by you.  In many respects saying, ""I am a girl (or boy for trans masculine people)"", ""I want to be a girl"", ""I am trans"", ""I wish I was trans/could transition"" are, in a sense, variations on the same thing.  One thing that complicates this is how binary and/or fluid your gender is. I can only speak from my own experience as a binary trans woman (this means I only feel like I have a feminine gender and it does not change).  But some people have a fluid gender identity (meaning they might be more masculine in some moments and more feminine in other moments. And other people are non-binary. Perhaps they don't identify as either male or female. Perhaps they identify as both. Or perhaps they don't feel like they have a gender. For some people, exploring this can help. Early in my exploration I looked at how it might feel to express myself as a very feminine man. I also thought (briefly) about the idea of not having a ""traditional"" gender identity. For me, such avenues of exploration were fruitful because I always found myself disappointed that they would not lead me to being accepted as a woman.  So, for me, that's where I wound up. But that is only my story.  The second question is also worth exploring, perhaps in conjunction with the first. In what ways do you imagine yourself transitioning? Transition is not a single process. It is different for everyone. Some people transition quickly, others in a more methodical manner. Some people take hormones and feel OK with that. Other people don't take hormones. Other people know that they want certain surgeries (and there is far more than one, single transgender surgery). Breast augmentation, trachea shaves and vagioplasty are but three of many options. In a sense, there is no such thing as a ""sex change surgery"".  It can also be important to think about non-medical forms of transition, like voice lessons or, perhaps, using breastforms.  Finally, it is OK not to know what you want to do. Some people start out thinking they will want various surgeries only to decide that the results of HRT are enough for them. Other people think that they will never want surgery but, then, in year 3 of transition come to think otherwise. There is no one single way to transition. And that makes sense, because transition is all about authenticity and there is no one single way to be a woman. Look around you! There are all kinds of women, so the question becomes what kind of woman do I want to be, you know?"

asktransgender,3dtshe,AmantisAsoko,10,Sun Jul 19 22:45:07 2015 UTC,"I should emphasize, if there's one thing you should take away from your exchanges here, it's this: transition is a huge decision, and you - only you - can make it for yourself. A good therapist will help you, but ultimately it's your decision, not a therapist's, and not your parents'.  Some questions to consider (you don't need to answer them here, just think about them): How will your family react? How much do you know about the transition process? Have you considered non-binary identities (genderfluid, genderqueer, etc. These can also entail a measure of physical transition)? And others. Just food for thought. You can answer some by experimenting to some degree. Others you'll want to discuss with someone."
asktransgender,3dtshe,Hypatia_the_Wrathful,2,Sun Jul 19 13:10:29 2015 UTC,"Regardless, if they choose to transition, in most countries, they're gonna need a therapist anyways."
asktransgender,3dtshe,Artemis_in_Exile,4,Sun Jul 19 18:03:22 2015 UTC,"That's excellent. I think the phase from ""I want to be"" to ""I am"" is a major part of Internal Transition or Internal Alignment. It's not the end of it, because Morpheus's quote I see as the end of that, ""don't think you are, know you are."" (I believe once you realize you are said gender and can state it, then the next phase is not needing validation and just knowing you are - and I think sadly some of us never reach this state of mind.)  Both ""I want to be"" and ""I am"" are the same direction of movement. And those who want to be will one day hopefully and most likely wake up and are realize ""they are"", and maybe even realize ""they have always been."""
asktransgender,3dtshe,ZelkyZo,4,Sun Jul 19 15:44:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed. From what I've seen from both myself and others it goes some like:  Something's not right ---> Questioning gender ---> Desire to change gender ---> realization you are that gender ---> internal validation of your own gender.

asktransgender,3dtshe,Sarah123t,12,Sun Jul 19 16:47:30 2015 UTC,"The language surrounding gender dysphoria is confusing and difficult, because the sensation of having the ""wrong"" gender is felt by such a small fraction of humanity. This is why, imo, none of the ways of describing it feels quite right. Sadly, this is latched onto by transphobes as evidence that we are delusional and denying reality (if we say, ""I am a girl"" or ""I am a boy""), or that we're insincere (if we say ""I want to be a girl"" or ""I want to be a boy""), etc.  For me, I vocalized my feelings (only to myself, and only on rare occasions when I let myself) as something like ""I wish I were a girl,"" or ""I wish I didn't have these parts."" What I didn't think about until much later was that the reason I had that wish was that, underneath it, that was the body and identity that would make me most comfortable. Of course I wished for that body...  If you are persistently feeling this way, then I think there's a good chance they are just different ways of expressing how you feel. I agree with /u/Artemis_in_Exile that therapy would be helpful if it's possible. From where you are, it took me 21 years to figure this out on my own (and looking back, holy shit was it blindingly obvious; I guess that's why I was blind to it!)"
asktransgender,3dtshe,ZelkyZo,7,Sun Jul 19 12:06:48 2015 UTC,"This is my understanding:  'I want to be a girl' - I want to move towards appearing physically female and find the freedom to express myself in a more feminine way.  'I am a girl' - Deep down, I already feel like I'm female and this explains why I want to look and act more feminine.  So, both thoughts can kind of co-exist.  Is there anyone you know you can talk to about how you feel? Someone you can trust and is understanding?"

I know I'll wake up tomorrow and feel completely different again, back to doubting and hiding myself.

asktransgender,3dtshe,Amy_of_Dallas,4,Sun Jul 19 16:25:12 2015 UTC,"I could've written this myself when I was first starting out.  I've always wanted to be a girl, never said ""I am a girl"". Started feeling pretty strongly about it at 13, but had thoughts here and there that went back through early childhood. I was never feminine (though I was always a sensitive kid), and my hobbies were all stereotypically masculine.  And, yes, if that button existed, I would've pressed it without hesitation.  I've been enjoying my transition. Having a female (or at least more female than I started with) face, body, appearance, and name has felt great.  I'll say this: wanting -- or more specifically, preferring -- is enough, and identity is a trap."
asktransgender,3dtshe,ZelkyZo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:48:22 2015 UTC,"Just curious, but what do you mean by ""identity is a trap""?"
asktransgender,3dtshe,Cononymous,7,Sun Jul 19 15:45:01 2015 UTC,"Getting hung up on who or what you identify as is a mistake, and it leads people to mistakenly believe they're not trans.  Instead, it's better to focus on things like what physical features you want to have, how you want to present, what name you want to go by, etc."

asktransgender,3dtshe,ZelkyZo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:00:39 2015 UTC,I just want to include that identity is a trap insofar as it is perceived as static and unchanging.    If we don't allow ourselves to ebb and flow with our inevitably changing selves we're set up for identity to be constricting.
asktransgender,3dtshe,Lain42,3,Sun Jul 19 18:20:11 2015 UTC,"If you believe your inner self is a girl... then you're a girl.  You're hesitant and doubting yourself, and that's okay.   But given the fact that I have been ""male"" for the past sixteen years of my life, I don't know that I am female, or have a female gender identity.   It's human nature to want the status quo to not change. That's fine. I internally refer to myself(for the most part) with female pronouns. Try referring to yourself with female pronouns. Remember, after or during transitioning, you're still you. You're not some new person. You're not a replacement for who you used to be. You're the person you should be. You are a girl if your inner self is a girl. It's the outer body that's the shoe that doesn't fit.  Hope this helps."

I would have never considered i might be non-binary if i hadn't questioned my identity so much. In my case i settled on trans-feminine, a spectrum of non-binary identities on the feminine side of identities. It helped me to understand my gender queerness and gender fluidity, as well as why i want a normal female's body enough to do HRT and possibly other medical procedures, and sometimes want to do typically feminine things but I am still for lack of a better word a tomboy in terms of clothing and interests. It also explains why i like being androgynous sometimes and more typically feminine other times. In the end i currently tend not to call myself a ""woman"", but i do say that i'm closer to women than I am to men."

Privilege can be comforting too.  And it's easy to end up idolizing ""being a woman"" or ""being a girl"" as something that is not allowed for us.  Stepping outside of that identity is deeply scary, it's an act of being psychologically naked and admitting to the world ""yes, I am missing a lot of the experiences and learning and sisterhood that goes into making a woman a woman.""

At the risk of jumping the gun a bit, I'd say you're definitely a girl.  What kept me in the mindset you're in was depression and slight internalized transphobia. I was an ugly creepy boy who wanted to be something he's wasn't. Cliche as it is, I had to learn to love myself to be able to see that I had always been a girl and I just needed to take the necessary steps to make my body and presentation line up with that to alleviate my dysphoria."
asktransgender,3dtshe,illuminess,2,Sun Jul 19 15:53:28 2015 UTC,"This question has been asked many times on here by many different trans people, myself included (and repeatedly). It may bring you some comfort to know that a lot of us who have asked that question have transitioned or are currently transitioning (me).   It's ok to not intrinsically know that you are your gender. Gender identity is difficult to consider in yourself, it's relatively easy to abstract but youll find that in yourself, trying to nail it down can be like kicking your feet around in some clear water, you will likely muddt it up a lot and not be able to see what it is you're searching for.  I have had some moderate to severe anxiety (OCD pure obsessional type) surrounding my gender identity so I'll ask you some questions and they might help bring a little relief.   Do you ever worry that something good will happen to you? Does yiur anxiety take the form of freaking you out by telling you ""Im probably going to have a great day today, and nothing bad will happen!"" ? Having answered #1, are you more afraid that you might be a girl, or more afraid and anxious and fearful that you are not? If this is difficult to answer, try answering it in the hypothetical vacuum of transitioning having no real social consequences, and is accepted and widely supported. In that hypothetical context, are you more afraid that you are trans, or more afraid that you are not?   It took me a long time to sort out my own fears. While poorly worded, I feel like the questions above might help you come to a conclusion I made myself, and that is ""My anxiety tells me the worst case scenario will happen. If I am terrified of not being a girl, then not being a girl is my worst case scenario. If not being a girl is my worst case, then it stands to reason that I am one.""  Hope this helps :)"

If you're questioning whether you're female, don't forget to question whether you're male, too.  http://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/04/17/the-null-hypothecis/  This often puts doubts in perspective, because you should treat your apparent (assigned) gender with equal uncertainty."

asktransgender,3dtshe,loneloser,-9,Sun Jul 19 21:47:12 2015 UTC,"I want to be a millionaire...    Do you act like a girl? That's probably the biggest indicator. If you hear about how guys think and act and can't relate (and I mean any guys, not just stereotypically masculine ones) but you can relate your thought patterns to women, then that's a pretty good indicator that you are a girl in your head and not just someone wishing to be something they like.    Either way, you can get on hormones to look more feminine if that's what you want."
asktransgender,3dtshe,dualitynyc,6,Sun Jul 19 11:58:00 2015 UTC,"Lol what?  I gotta disagree.  You frame it like this is all about gender roles with your ""do you act like a girl or a boy?""  What does a girl or a boy act like?  I don't feel like I act like a ""girl"" or a ""boy.""  I act like me.  For me personally, this dysphoria thing has to do with a disconnect between my mind and body that's been present at least since I was a toddler.

I didn't say anything about gender roles. I'm not asking if OP thinks they act like a caricature of a woman, I'm asking if their personality resembles women that he's seen or met. This could help them tell the difference between just wanting to look female and being female minded but stuck in a man's body.    I'm sorry if I've offended you, I'm really not trying to apply this to every trans person everywhere.

asktransgender,3dtshe,loneloser,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:18:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not offended.  I think it's an interesting discussion.  But I do think you're talking more about gender roles.  I don't think there's really anything innately gendered about your outward personality.  Some things work better with what you may have happened to have been born with and certain ways we're taught to interact with the world are based on those differences, but I mean, there are docile men, there are violent women, and there are sensitive men and insensitive women, and it's not like those things are uncommon and it isn't like the list ends there.  I just can't think of a single personality trait that is inherently ""male"" or inherently ""female.""  I don't know why exactly I want to be a woman but I know it goes a whole lot deeper than if I do something so superficial as how an average woman supposedly ""acts.""  Maybe I ""act"" like how a woman ""acts"" in certain ways, but I probably also ""act"" like how a man ""acts"" in other ways, but in other ways still, maybe I act like neither.  I don't want to be a woman because I think I ""act like a girl,"" even if some things I do or ways I behave may seem less than masculine, or because I want to ""act"" like a girl.  I want to be a woman because there is a disconnect between my mind and my body that's always been there.  How a man or a woman ""acts"" though, down to simple mannerisms, is largely superficial and it isn't like there isn't a ton of variance in how much people of either sex play into gendered constructs.  When this whole transition thing is said and done, I probably will be a little more feminine in myannerisms and presentation, because like I said, you work with what you got, but I'll still just basically be me."
asktransgender,3dtshe,Artemis_in_Exile,3,Sun Jul 19 19:39:21 2015 UTC,"I act more like a guy, but that's only because I was AMAB and have been treated as a male for the past sixteen years (and hence haven't had the opportunity to do anything ""feminine"" or express myself freely as I would like to).  I don't really know how I think, or how it relates to how most males (or females) think.

asktransgender,3dtshe,loneloser,7,Sun Jul 19 12:14:26 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with /u/loneloser on this one. Social behavior can be indicative of gender identity, but they aren't the same thing.

Attacking Jenner for receiving a prize that really should have gone to so many other people who put their life in danger (not just their reputation) isn't attacking the whole trans community, it's attacking some celebrity getting something for just existing. I personally know many trans women who would deserve a courage award for what they do, but Jenner gets it because... why? Because she's already famous."

asktransgender,3dtzyz,Alyssa_B,2,Sun Jul 19 18:10:55 2015 UTC,"Try to realize that very rarely do you have people railing against a trans person that are not actually heavily transphobic or bigoted.  It's a common tactic to couch bigotry in barely relevant arguments that serve to heighten a bigot's credibility by making it seem they have a reason to care other than being closeminded and ignorant. These types are really annoying because they will try to engage in debate over their opinions, and will shut down the second they are unraveled.  You can educate them that their argument is invalid but they will still cling on to their hate because it's irrational, they're irrational, and unlikely to change.  Example, a friend of a friend on facebook was ranting about Caitlyn Jenner spending thousands on treatment when there are starving children who need help. Pretty easy to see that's an incredible load of bullshit meant to hide her transphobia. When she was asked how it was ok for her to go shopping on the weekends for new clothes when there are starving children, she shut down. She's still a transphobe and a bigot.   It helps to realize who you're talking to with this stuff, because very few people are transphobic for any reason other than total ignorance and hatred/lack of empathy or understanding for difference and diversity."

I never once had to show as much guts during any of those deployments as I do every time I come out to a new person. I also don't consider either situation as being brave. I had things I had to do to survive and I did them. It was fear that motivated me. Fear of death in both cases.  These unfair comparisons are usually made by people that have been in neither situation. I think they do it in an attempt to cover up their own shame of personally perceived cowardice.

People can disagree with Caitlyn Jenner getting the award but they don't need to stoop to transphobic comments to get there. In these kinds of conversations the best advice I can give is to stay calm no matter how much the poster deserves it, calling them names and stuff doesn't really work well. You seemed to be doing fine though.  Personal Opinion: I feel the soldier is the most courageous, he's extremely brave and is a true hero. Caitlyn Jenner is undeniably brave in what she's doing but personally I don't feel what she's done is quite on the same level. However, the award is meant to highlight someone, it shouldn't go to the most courageous but to the person the award will contribute the most to. The soldier would have felt pleased at getting the award but by giving it to Caitlyn the media has helped highlight a huge issue."

I looked into that too; I found an ""Ask a Rabbi"" website and emailed their Reform rabbi to ask both about name changes and bar/bat mitzvahs. The nice rabbi told me that our tradition, the old old way, is that you change your name when a big life-changing thing happens. Transition definitely counts. :P She said you can do a ceremony or something if you want, but you don't have to. You can just start using the new name and that's it.  She also said that while you can have a(nother) bar/bat mitzvah ceremony to honor your transition, you don't have to do that either to be considered a man/woman in our tradition or in the community. Once you're 12 (girls) or 13 (boys), you are a bat or bar mitzvah. The ceremony is just a formality; it can be nice and feel very affirming, but it's not necessary at all.

He is not the ""typical"" FTM trans person who would say that he was always male -- he identified as female until a few years ago, so he was okay with my saying that I had found myself to be the mother of a grown-up man without every having had a baby boy or a little boy or a teenage boy.

You don't seem to live on the same town you grew up in and I don't recall there being a record of names with the federation so really the only association is in your head and maybe with your family but I bet your family is reform like most peoples here so I doubt they think of it that way. Or they're horrid cunts but in that case there's probably worse going on than your Jewish name being masculine.   The answer to your question is that its not hard to do and there's no rules against it. It isn't uncommon to change your Jewish name many times in life as far as I recall and youre even encouraged to do it after a big life change.

No-one can give you a conclusive answer but yourself, though. It's OK to take your time and figure things out. You don't have to transition immediately. I'm 5ft, so I get what you mean about men's clothes not fitting, but women's clothes don't fit me either, so I wear the men's clothes anyway. Hell, don't worry about other people; how do they know you're not shopping for clothes for someone else? And as for not wearing dresses at weddings, well, some people are androgynous or tomboys, so I don't think anyone's going to see you not wearing a dress and assume you're trans.

Magic button / wave a wand / wishing standing in front of the mirror. Being terrified of the implications, ""something I could probably put up with"", avoiding mirrors or photographs, etc.  How would you feel if someone read your post and said ""Nope, zero chance you are trans, just get on with life"" ? How did you feel seeing other posts saying "" Yes you should explore this further "" ? Another way to look is not trying to push yourself towards a label but whether with everything you've been through and thought whether you would positively identify with being cisgender.  Opening up to talk is really hard the first time. I think it sounds like you could do with talking some more with a professional and see where it leads."

asktransgender,3du68h,Sarah123t,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:13:42 2015 UTC,"Finally, some times I think ""yeah, there's a possibility that I could transition"", but other times I think that I've been living as female for 25 years, so I could probably put up with it for the rest of my life, even though there's a high chance that I'll be pretty much miserable (and other times when I think that that ""putting up with it"" is absolutely ridiculous and I'd be wasting my life).   I thought so too, and resisted dealing with this multiple times during my pre-transition life. If I had stopped listening to that reasoning the first time, I would've transitioned 18 years ago.  Can you imagine how much different my life would be?   Do you want to have that same thought you're having now 7 years from now, when you're my age?   I had no idea how much happier my life could be until the weight of dysphoria started to come off. I'm not even the same person. It's not because I'm presenting a different gender, it's because I'm not angry at the world anymore.  Ultimately it's up to you, but if your hesitation is that the road is too hard, you're going to find a lot of people here that tell you; You have the strength.  We might not know you, but we know ourselves and that we had those same fears. Lots of us didn't think we had the strength, but you end up finding it. As things change and you get happier, that strength becomes easier to find.   Now with that out of the way, can I be a little snarky and say obligatory, if you have to ask you probably are.  ;)"

Definitely one of the things I'm most afraid of is growing old, and think backing, full of regret, and wonder why I didn't do things differently.

The trick is that our ability accept our transition comes when we're ready for it. If you're not ready now, and you're ready in the future, then that's the right time.  As to my snarky italics, it's as common around here as an answer as your question. It's pretty true though. Cis people just don't have these thoughts, not at all.

Eddie Izzard is a non-transitioning transgender woman (transvestite) and his standup comedy is spectacular, often incorporating his tales about his gender identity, so you might consider some of his albums (spotify link here).

It's statistics saying it will be 12.5 years were you to start in 2017, if things don't change. It's not 2017 yet.  You can choose whichever GIC you want in the country - there are 7 of them in England and 1 in Scotland. Nottingham and Exeter have the shortest waiting lists, of about 6 months until first appointment (~12 months until start of treatment). If you can get to it and your doctor agrees to refer you there, the shortest wait is in Daventry in Northamptonshire - about 12 weeks until the first appointment. If your doctor doesn't let you choose any of these, one clinic that definitely accepts referrals from all around the country is Charing Cross in London - where the current wait is 13 months for the initial appointment (~18 until start of treatment).   If all those options are still too long to wait, there are two private clinics, Transhealth and Gendercare, both based in London. They both charge about ~£400 in total to start and the waiting times are between 2-4 months until start of treatment."

Trans stuff is so not special anymore, your doctor's just want to know you are safe most of all.  If you have something go wrong, it is probably an overzealous gatekeeper.

The psychologist I saw said that I didn't exactly fit into the gender dysphoria, at least not all the requirements, but that I was in a suitable mental place to go ahead with it as it was what I wanted for a long time. So really there is no way to know how they will react to what you say."

So I can only speak for myself, but the voice in my head never sounded gendered to me.  It was simply just me.

It is like you said though, just that feeling that there might be someone who is willing to like and accept me.  And while I was prepared for total rejection, I just think that comment took me off guard.  I've been trying to just not overthink the negative and focus on the positive today."
asktransgender,3dvex3,LinaKatharina,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:21:46 2015 UTC,Focus on the positive is always a good thing.   Maybe you just try to get him to apologize. If you think he realized try to get him to that point without pointing at it directly.

I am the guy in my scenario and I met the girl through online gaming as well, scarily similar actually haha.   Anyways, while I cant give you advice on how you should feel or help you on that I can give you a peek into his mind.   If hes anything like me, based on his response (was literally the same as mine) he told you the truth and he cares about you.  The only thing is that at first, there is an unfamiliarity that almost feel uncomfortable, and you dont know what to expect. He literally hit two walls in one, both the question mark of an online relationship and the question mark of something he knew nothing about.   All in all, I would probably take it as a compliment. Like many others said, he just had some pretty bad wording. But Id look at what really happened. He isnt afraid of still being himself with you and saying what he really feels. He was completely honest with you in saying what he said whether he knew it might offend you or not. He was just honest.   You shouldnt feel bad about yourself, in fact you can probably find the silver lining, the happiness from this situation. But still explain to him that it did offend you and tell him how you felt. Something I learned today as well  :)  Its probably not really my place to offer advice, but I felt like maybe my input might help a little.  Sorry if it didnt.   :)"

asktransgender,3dum3g,IAmCluelessSoFearMe,4,Sun Jul 19 17:09:23 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go point by point.  1) I'm early in transition as an MtF, and I'm a total tomboy (if someone has a better word for that, tell me). I play sports, weld, can still drink my male friends under the table via whiskey, prefer pants over skirts almost every day. Gender binary is silly, so don't do it. You get to choose who you want to be.   2) Can't really help ya here, I don't have severe genital dysphoria. Friends that are post-srs seem quite happy to me though. Right now when dysphoria is at it's worst, it's easy to think everything is overwhelming. Your priorities may very well shift as you transition. Originally I had no interest in any surgery down there, but I'm already considering an orchie.   3) We all deal with it in our own way. You end up finding that strength in yourself. Your experience with this will depend greatly on where you live.   4) HRT as far as routines go, has been no harder than a few blood tests and taking pills daily. It's not even close to difficult. The hard part for me was the initial mood swings. I was mean.   5) You're going to have more emotions, because testosterone blocks a lot of them. It's not overwhelming, and I certainly don't think you'll find it to be a bad thing.   It's not required to transition, but for me at least, I found it incredibly hard to hide forever. I dated the girls I wanted to be and became the guy I wanted to date. I had an engagement ring, a shared business, and a plan for that hetereo-cis-normative future of two kids and a house on some land outside of Austin.   At some point last year, I just realized that the depression, frustration, and anger that I had at life was all tied to these feelings of dysphoria. I had to do something about it. I certainly wish I had done so earlier when I had false starts. In reality I could be 14 years into transition right now instead of 6 months.  If you can't function now, I don't think that's going to get better. I did go through cycles, but it was bad.   I always said that if your ""freakout scale"" was 1-10, I woke up every day at an 8. Now I wake up at a 1 or 2. I never realized how heavy the weight of dysphoria was until I started to shed it.   Someone said it the other day on here and I liked it.  The best time to plant a tree was 7 years ago, the next best time is today."

asktransgender,3dum3g,Henchman24RIP,3,Sun Jul 19 19:39:14 2015 UTC,"I've loved it, to be honest.   I was almost completely emotionally numb from t through the years. I went through two horrible break ups, and never cried about them. I wanted to, but couldn't.   I'm not some teary-eyed mess now, but the newfound empathy is pretty amazing. I always had it, but it's pretty intense now. I've found myself having really sweet/amazing thoughts about my friends randomly, and sent them messages of support and appreciation about that.   I feel like I enjoy life more now, because I no longer have that block. It's really allowed me to forgive some people and mend bridges that I had thought were gone.   I constantly get private messages online, or get taken aside in public by friends who tell me how much happier I look now. That's definitely part of the emotional freedom, even if I do like how I look in the mirror now (most days).  Some days suck, but there's a lot less of them now. My depressions last for a day now, and they used to last for months."

asktransgender,3dum3g,Smurftastical,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:16:38 2015 UTC,"I really have so many questions. I feel I'm in the severe disphoria state right now. I'm 34, no kids, no career, no relationship. I'm not bad looking in anyway, just have been a massive shutin most my life. The depression and closeted dressing has been going on for a looooooooooong time. I knew I wanted to be a girl when I was 6 and trying on clothes during playtimes at daycare.   My biggest fear has been my family and any kind of jobs. Finding a job/employer who will accept this has to be nearly impossible (or so I think because I'm such a pessimist) I'm full of nothing but fear and frustration that I couldn't have been born maybe 20 years later and just going through this now at 14. (I'm 34) There was no reddit for me then. When I was caught a few times by my mom, she just took me to a psychologist who listened to her cry, then tried to talk to me. I can still remember sitting in the room with her and the guy and her bawling her eyes out. All I could do was say no and deny everything to try to make her happy. I feel this has been going on forever now. I don't know how to make me happy. I feel like I want to transition and go through this, but I can't because of dirty looks or things people say, my families opnions, etc, etc. (My school years were filllllled with TONS of bullying and gay bashing toward feminine kids. It has scared me deeply.)  How do you deal with meeting others? My voice is somewhat deep, but I pitch it sorta high in girl mode (AKA customer service voice). I feel like even if I could pass, and I might be able too, the voice will be a dead giveaway and cause all sorts of tension or problems. My hair is pretty much gone on top and I feel like wigs would be a dead giveaway. I have no clue about new things with hair nowdays. Have these been issues at all?  I have always had a massive problem with my emotions. My depression and anxiety has been crippling to my entire life. I'm not enthusiastic about anything, unless I dress up a bit. But I can't even imagine going out my door. I have no real friends, and maybe that's some of the problem.  I'm sorry if I'm all over the place, but my mind is working over drive right now. I just got on Medicaid and have been looking into gender dysphoria specialist in my area. (Waiting on a few calls tomorrow)"
asktransgender,3dum3g,Henchman24RIP,2,Mon Jul 20 03:28:26 2015 UTC,"You described me in a lot of ways in that first paragraph. I know a lot of those same fears.   I don't know where you live, I'm sure that does in some ways affect this process. For me, confronting the fears showed that for the most part, I was building them up to be far more intimidating than they turned out to be.   For me, the only way to get past those fears is to work to overcome them. I tried to run away from them. Like you I knew who I was when I was young, and I wanted to transition in my very early-teens. I didn't do it then, but I couldn't let myself regret another year.   My voice is also deep, and I'm still waiting for a referral to a voice therapist. I can pitch it up high, like you, but I feel like it's weird. There is hope, look up the Yeson voice surgeries, and you'll see the drastic effect that they can have. It seems to cost about the same as a breast augmentation.  I also have the hair issues, and honestly, I've been avoiding dealing with it. I've never personally seen anything ""medical"" that pleased me, but I also always thought it was a lost cause. Hopefully someone else here can point us both in a better direction.  That said, I grew up in Oakland, and while I'm white, I certainly know that there are LOTS of women who wear wigs all day every day. African American women have an entire world of knowledge and fashion there, it's really amazing, and there is some hope.   I bought a full lace (I don't recommend it, glue sucks) human hair wig direct from China. My friend cut and colored it, and honestly, it looks pretty damn awesome. I get compliments on it all the time.   The advantage of wigs is you can change your hairstyle as often as you have the funds and want to. There are disadvantages, but we're goin' bright side right?   Hell, there are wigs that you can waterski with, without glue. I've been looking around to see what my options are because I'm very active in sports and will likely be competing seriously. It's an area of concern for me.   Depression and anxiety was absolutely crippling for me as well. I felt numb. I came out after 4 months of HRT to everyone, and since that day, I haven't had a time where I felt depressed for longer than a day.   I actually have to get used to smiling a lot. I used to hate smiling.  Don't worry about asking too many questions. I type pretty fast and I like to try and be helpful. I can't answer everything and I'm certainly not authoritative on most subjects. I'm still pretty new to this myself, but I am supportive, and I am open."

I love all the info, but the biggest thing that sticks out is smiling. It's been soooooo long since I've really smiled for maybe more than like 5 seconds. I honestly forget what it feels like to be happy and smile with confidence.  It's been such a weird week too. My thoughts have been on full charge about all this, just out of nowhere. I find myself catching my male brain saying hurtful crap that I've heard spouted by others over and over. I had an episode yesterday of trying to wear my boy clothes only the whole day out of frustration, but I felt like I was lying to myself.  I really hope this does get better. I'm petrified of telling anyone at this point. Hopefully a counselor/psychiatrist can help. For the longest time I have been in such denial about everything that I have never looked into anything about this. In my mind, everything medical or psychological is still in terms of the 1990's. But, like the voice thing you mentioned, and other things I've seen, it's giving me a little hope.  You are the first and only person I've talked to on reddit about this. Thank you SOOOO much.

It's just odd that I have more drive to save the money up for something like that, than I ever have for anything else.  The strangest part about all this, is how much I've just noticed my looks this past week. All these years of not caring, I've just never noticed these things. It's like some switch finally came on. It's so weird, but so exciting....but so weird. I find myself eating better than I ever have been to try and watch my weight. I've given up on a few nasty bad habits with food. It's like subconsciously I know this is what I want and this is what will make my life better. It just feels amazing to get this stuff out for once.  It's people like you that do really help a lot. It was posts like these, that I've read for days, just trying to find someone similar to what I've gone through.

They just said they were happy for me to continue doing it as long as I was getting blood tests but that I'd still have to wait until their assessment period was up before they could refer me to an endo.  This did mean that in April - just before signing the consent form - I had to sit there while a doctor explained the potential changes from HRT to someone who had already been on it for 18 months (including telling me that it would have no effect on facial hair when I know from experience that it absolutely did for me). ""You should begin to grow breasts""... yeah, no shit, what do you think these are?   It's daft."

Where as with being a girl I don't do it for approval. The opposite in fact. I do it for me.  I mean some things sure I would have enjoyed otherwise, but not as much as I used to tell myself I did. And I'm sure I would have found other hobbies I enjoyed more.   Like my favorite thing out of anything to do in video games was to dress up, and to customize the characters. Why wasn't I just dressing up? It's way more fun."

I'm AFAB and picked up so many culturally-expected female habits (makeup, shaving, feminine hobbies, etc etc as nauseam) that absolutely felt like they stunted my life and my ability to engage with the world. I changed my entire persona around puberty because I desperately wanted to fit in, to be whatever a girl was supposed to be. I stifled myself and had a new personality every week because my real one choked to death and never even developed. I had no real interests or driving passions.  I still mourn the active, boisterous little boy I could have (should have!) been -- and I feel sad for the anxious, isolated, and unremarkable woman I shaped myself into. I missed out on an entire life and now I'm in my late 20s and literally trying to figure out ""what's my favorite color?""-level basic shit about myself.  As I started to transition, I realized very starkly that we are constant works in progress. Age 10, 20, 50, 80 -- you NEVER have to stop changing or reinventing yourself. You are never done growing up. Seriously. You've already tried a lot of things and realized they don't fit you, so take this opportunity to examine what else in your life doesn't feel genuine to you. You hate the color blue but you have all these stupid blue shirts? Fuck 'em. Toss them. Download Spotify and put on a random genre radio station that you've never really listened to. Read a book in a genre you haven't read. Take a day trip to do something you don't usually do -- an art show, a hike, a farmer's market, whatever. Pretend you're showing the world to a young girl you care for, a daughter or a niece or something - what would you want her to experience and learn? When she tells you that she likes something, let her pursue it full steam ahead, and then let her cast it aside and try something new if she feels like it. Give your girl self the room and freedom to grow as if you are a kid again, without the restraints on identity changes that adulthood dumps on us."

asktransgender,3dtk2d,Kimber360,3,Mon Jul 20 00:20:37 2015 UTC,"Your story sounds a lot like mine, or at least parts of it.  But I don't feel like my life was a lie. In ways I was incomplete, and I had strong feelings that I both refused to share with others or to even acknowledge as having been strong.  Through it all, though, I've been me. I'm happier now that I'm beginning to explore those off-limits behaviors and experiences, but gender is hardly the only facet of my life that I've become more open to sharing as I've gotten older.  So it may sometimes feel like it, but I suspect that most of what you knew about yourself is still true. You don't have to drop anything unless you want to. My advice would be to take things slowly and give yourself a chance to learn what you feel different about now and what you don't. There's no shame in changing."

When you find your mind wandering back to the past, let it go there for a bit, but don't dwell.

I can definitely see how it would be different for someone who interacts in much less accepting circles.  I would say to definitely come out on Facebook. Personally I just changed my profile picture to something that was very obviously feminine and I let ppl guess from there.  For coming out to school, I just walked in wearing girl clothes. A few friends already knew since I basically had to wait over a year to go full time. For coming out to some people it was easier to do it as a ""heads up"" kind of thing."

I decided I wanted to lose some weight, and through a moderate (NOT extreme at all) change in diet and increase in exercise, got down to about 150 (maybe 152) around when i started HRT a few months later. Now, 6 months in, I'm hovering at 156-157 without much special effort. So I've gained a tiny bit since starting HRT, but because I'd just lost it, I think it's more of a fluctuation than anything.  Muscle is beginning to fade a bit, and despite this slight increase in weight, my tummy and waist is thinner than ever. I've had love handles since I was a kid, and they're practically gone now. So I'm definitely putting that weight somewhere else, probably on my thighs but it's a little hard to tell.  As far as muscle loss leading to weight loss, I think you need to think about it as though you're eating your muscle---your body is doing that, not just throwing it out. So you'll tend to convert it to fat or otherwise store it, and I don't think it will cause automatic weight loss. Overall, the reduction in basal metabolic rate (what you're burning just by being) means you'll need to reduce your intake."

That's just how autonomy and free will work.  What you can do is show concern without being invalidating. You can ask questions that might get them to think about what they're doing, i.e. ""what changed from when you were saying you didn't want the changes from T?"" (I don't know your friend, so I don't know if that's actually a good question to ask, but you get the idea.) Open ended questions are best.  If your friend really is making a mistake, it's probably most important that you stick around to be their support no matter what, even if those other friends are going to ditch them. Just leave the ""I told you so"" unsaid.  ...I think I basically just wrote the same thing as /u/amadeoamante in different words, oh well."
asktransgender,3dtbei,rainbow_unicorn_barf,3,Sun Jul 19 12:40:44 2015 UTC,"I've done exactly that. I've asked open ended questions and they give me non-answers. Back when they were just non-binary they told me in great detail about it and examples proving that it's not just in their head. They can't even describe what they mean by ""feeling more male lately"" means or what it's connected to. They don't want to know because it's attached to the thrill of not being regarded as a girl, and they were saying something along these lines right up until they got way upset over something and changed their mind.    I can't force my friend to do anything, and I can't force them to keep me in their life. I just want to prevent my friend from falling in the hole they're digging and never getting up out of it. If they weren't a suicide risk I wouldn't care so much, but they get so unreasonably upset sometimes..."
asktransgender,3dtbei,amadeoamante,6,Sun Jul 19 12:52:21 2015 UTC,"I know they're going to regret it because they've told me they don't want most of the changes from T. They've been saying that they really are feeling more like being a guy is right for them, repeating it until they convince themself it's true.   Do you know this?  Are you inside your friend's head?  Maybe you've developed some kind of telepathy?  Because if not, you only know what your friend has been able to tell you, as well as they've been able to explain themself.  I find it hard to believe that anyone would start taking a hormone if they didn't want at least some of its effects.  Have you talked to your friend about this?  If so, what did they say?  Make sure you communicate your reservations, and if you still don't understand their reasoning, ask them to explain why taking testosterone will give them what they want.  Maybe your friend only wants to take it for a little while, to get some of the effects.  Maybe they will wind up regretting it, or maybe they'll be thrilled with the results.  Either way, you can't make this decision for your friend.  You can be there for them, listen to them, help them when they have problems.  But you can't save everyone from all the mistakes they may or may not make.  People need to live their own lives, learn from things, and learn what they want in life.  All you can do is be there for them, no matter what happens.  At least with regard to suicide, studies have shown that people are less likely to want to kill themselves if they have a good support system.  Be part of that support for them.  That's the best thing that a friend can do, for anyone."

I don't have to be a mind reader to see that they're making a rash decision because they're upset.    I've talked to them in the past about maybe trying a low dose of T to get some of the changes they do want, but that's not what they're talking about now. They think penises are disgusting and would never want one. They want no body hair and definitely no facial hair. They were totally cool with having boobs but then bought a binder because someone else convinced them they should bind. Now they're asking for male pronouns and getting full dose T and they can't even tell me what's changed their mind.    I have talked to them, I have expressed concern about why they've suddenly decided to be male. They're being weird about it. They used to tell me every thought that crossed their mind about being trans. I'm being cut out and when they backpedal the friends that are pressuring them will cut them out."
asktransgender,3dtbei,amadeoamante,2,Sun Jul 19 11:44:42 2015 UTC,"You are misgendering this person constantly here, which is a dickish thing to do.  It doesn't matter if you agree with someone.  You use the pronouns he tells you to.  Not okay.  Do you understand that it is very common to be outwardly fine with something until you realize that the alternative is realistic?  So someone might seem fine with their ASAB's pronouns, or boobs, until they start using different pronouns and binding and realize how much better they feel.  And if you want no body hair your are already having to remove all your body hair when estrogeny, or use permanent methods, and those work still when testosteroney, so it isn't really a reason to not take T.  And taking a lower dose wouldd just make those changes slower and thus harder to deal with, because you pretty much have to wait until puberty is over to reliably remove all that hair.  You are being cut out because you are being hostile towards a person's decisions about his own identity and body, which is reasonable of him."
asktransgender,3dtbei,shaedofblue,3,Sun Jul 19 14:25:17 2015 UTC,"Actually, no, I'm not. They still accept ""they"". Even if they didn't, ""they"" isn't a gendered pronoun so at best you could say is that I'm being disrespectful by not gendering them at all when I have the opportunity. But then you said ""You are misgendering this person"" and are being disrespectful by calling them a person instead of a man/boy/guy/dude by your rules.    I'm not concerned about them going on a low dose of T to try it out, I'm concerned about their sudden plan to transition to male on a full dose. Maybe they can get laser, but that won't happen until they grow enough hair to get laser, and maybe long before then they'll feel so shit about their decision and their three chin hairs that they'll off themself because, as I said, this person is unstable."

It's a bit hard to tell without being able to get erections without physical stimulation (not sure why, happened way before HRT.). However emotionally I get way more drawn to men, and I can't help but fall for some of them. It's like a lot different of a type of attraction than what I'm used to.  It's a feeling that I felt something similar to with women in the past rarely, when I felt they had feelings for me, but it was never this intense, and never quite as emotional. Like I had a desire.

But guy on guy just doesn't so anything for me."
asktransgender,3ds6c5,ZelkyZo,2,Sun Jul 19 19:03:21 2015 UTC,"I usually don't imagine myself in sexual situations.  If I imagine anything at all, it's predominantly focused on the woman or women, thereby making it lesbian.  It's just in more casual or date-like scenarios where the stuff in my previous post happens.  The closest I get is seeing a woman being pinned against a wall or something, like she's being overpowered, but is kind of blushing about it.  It was after realizing I am trans that it connected to me that I might be imagining a female self in that scenario.  I don't ever imagine a man doing that to me in this scenario but I would assume that's what it is.  I don't imagine myself doing the overpowering.  I never imagine my male self whenever I think of sex.  I just don't see myself being the type of person to be that aggressive sexually with a woman since I would be so paranoid about violating her personal space, hurting her, upsetting her, making her feel uncomfortable, her think I'm creepy or something, etc.  So I guess in that case being the submissive partner during sex feels more natural in my mind given the scenarios in my head.  I'm not sure if any of this means anything though."
asktransgender,3ds6c5,Shipsexual,3,Sun Jul 19 20:18:10 2015 UTC,Idk but that pinning up against a wall thing sounds really hot imo.
asktransgender,3ds6c5,ZelkyZo,2,Sun Jul 19 20:36:03 2015 UTC,"Rofl what part of it?  What's funny about that is just as I imagine this female, who I'm fairly certain is supposed to be me, being blonde and somewhat curly-haired, dressing the same way as I imagine I would as a woman, etc, who is blushing while all of this is happening, thinking about it to myself also makes me blush rofl.  Maybe it's just embarrassing to mention.  :P"
asktransgender,3ds6c5,Shipsexual,2,Sun Jul 19 20:40:22 2015 UTC,Idk I really like stuff like that especially if it was another woman doing it to me. There's just like something about it that makes me bite my lip.

We hung out and had great guy fun, hiking, canoeing, deep metaphysical debates and we would nerd out on science stuff. I found out he was gay but I told him I wasnt and he never made a pass at me. After a while I realised I had a crush, I admired everything about him and couldnt deny I was infatuated. The feeling grew to a burning and I climbed the balcony to his apartment and let myself in through the sliding glass door (done it a dozen times) only he was asleep on the couch, so I woke him up and confessed my love as a girl for a man, because I wasnt gay I was really a girl pretending to be a boy.  We were togeather for four years and I was a happy housewife, went straight to full time 19-23. Except he was still in the closet as a high school teacher, so we couldnt be seen togeather for fear of losing his job. (He was 30-34 btw) if we went somewhere like shopping togeather, we would split up and meet back at the car. If we went to dinner, I was ""just a friend"" I didnt really mind at the time because I believed him, I feared confrontation and condemnation as much as he did. Untill one night leaving a reasturant, he said something cute and endearing and I reflexively took his hand and leaned my head on his shoulder. He reflexively shook me off at justthe wrong time midstep and I tripped myself in my heels, stumbled off the curb, tripped again on the parking block and fell in a twisted mess in the oil slick. But instead of apologising, inquiring on my condition or help me up, he stood over me berating me about being seen togeather in public. I had to listen to him condem me all the way home and I realised I couldnt live the rest of my life in HIS closet. I left him shortly after."

But honestly I blame most of my problems on that, and really he may have not been interested anyway.

asktransgender,3dthny,Howler452,8,Sun Jul 19 08:20:41 2015 UTC,"straight   The word you're looking for is cis; sexuality is unrelated to gender.  First, you need to know about dysphoria. Essentially, a trans person's brain is closer to theirs identified gender than their assigned (meaning, ""you have [genital set] and are therefore fe/male"") gender; the mismatch causes psychological harm, and the only treatment is transition.    Medical transition consists hormone replacement - which turns the body into the desired sex at a genetic-cellular level (meaning, sexually dimorphic cells will be replaced with cells that behave as the desired sex) - and optionally surgery for genital reconstruction.  Social transition involves changing one's outward expression to match how they want to be seen, not how society expects them to be seen based on their assigned (natal) sex, and having others address you as your identified gender   There's more to it, but those are the basics."
asktransgender,3dthny,Hurts_,6,Sun Jul 19 08:34:50 2015 UTC,The word you're looking for is cis; sexuality is unrelated to gender.   My mistake. I appreciate the correction.  That is much easier to understand. Thank you :)
asktransgender,3dthny,Corticotropin,-4,Sun Jul 19 08:49:35 2015 UTC,"One nitpick, hormones can't change the Y chromosome you are born with and is in almost every cell of your body... they do probably change how they are expressed, though."
asktransgender,3dthny,Hurts_,6,Sun Jul 19 08:39:06 2015 UTC,"They don't change the Y chromosome, or even the SRY gene which is what usually dictates initial sex expression, but that's not what I said. A body's development is ultimately decided by the influence of hormones in-utero, not a single gene.  What hormones do is make cells express as if they were the sex corresponding to the current hormone balance, based on your genes."
asktransgender,3dthny,Corticotropin,-2,Sun Jul 19 08:40:51 2015 UTC,Didn't you say turns the body into the desired sex at the genetic-cellular level? That seemed to imply to me something about changing the chromosomes themselves.
asktransgender,3dthny,Hurts_,6,Sun Jul 19 08:48:56 2015 UTC,"Meaning they turn cells into their corresponding sex based on what your genes say about your body if it were to express as that sex.  Chromosomes are not inherently sexed.  ed: I'm going to sleep so if someone wants to pick up the ""chromosomes are not the end-all be-all of sex"" discussion, be my guest"
asktransgender,3dthny,Corticotropin,-2,Sun Jul 19 08:51:05 2015 UTC,I can agree with that definition. I just thought genetic-cellular level was misleading.
asktransgender,3dthny,Tsukeira,6,Sun Jul 19 09:05:42 2015 UTC,"It is a genetic and cellular change, so that terminology is accurate."
asktransgender,3dthny,Corticotropin,-3,Sun Jul 19 09:15:19 2015 UTC,"Oh, no, I understand that it's probably right. It's just that I still am a little confused."
asktransgender,3dthny,Artemis_in_Exile,4,Sun Jul 19 09:24:51 2015 UTC,"Ok, here's the deal. Half of every person's chromosomes are turned off after the initial en utero development. This applies to every human being with a normal chromosome count. In ""genetic males"", the Y chromosome is always the disabled chromosome of the sex chromosome pair. Meaning that the cells of every adult human run only one X chromosomes. Cellular genetic expression is thus only determined by the hormones in your system. Basically, the body has all the necessary genetic code to express either gender at a genetic level. Switching hormones causes that genetic cellular expression to switch gender expression too. Basically, then, _hurts was accurate in her statement."
asktransgender,3dthny,Corticotropin,4,Sun Jul 19 12:14:03 2015 UTC,"I don't know why I can't seem to communicate what I am thinking. I'm not disputing the fact that hormones change the expression of genes... I'm only saying that I, not anyone else, read the specific words genetic-cellular base to imply an actual change in the actual genes, rather than a different expression of genes.   The main reason I keep replying is because I'm trying to say, to clarify that   I understood X as Y, and I see that people think I'm wrong. I still don't understand why X doesn't mean Y, but I understand the concept OP is referring to as X (idk, call it Z) and accept it.   is what I meant, but it seems everyone is reading me as saying   Z is wrong!   and I feel like I'm leaving a bad impression if I remain being misunderstood.   In short, I think you've (and other people) been preaching to the choir for about 4 or so comments now @.@  ... also, on an unrelated self-esteem/lack-thereof note, now every one of my comments is at 0 or lower points and I want to just delet eeverything and hide in a hole."
asktransgender,3dthny,Tsukeira,4,Sun Jul 19 12:33:16 2015 UTC,"Sex hormones change the expression of genes.  Everyone has the genetic information for both masculine and feminine traits, but which genes are expressed and which are not depends on which sex hormone is active in the body.  Being as sex chromosomes (particularly the Y) only lead to initial development and do not actively contribute to sexual characteristcs, hormones are more relevant to what most people would call ""biological sex"" (I dislike that term, but that a whole other issue)."
asktransgender,3dthny,Corticotropin,2,Sun Jul 19 09:10:17 2015 UTC,Agreed.
asktransgender,3dthny,emilycsquared,3,Sun Jul 19 09:25:06 2015 UTC,"Well, there are a great many things that can be involved in transition, and which ones a person chooses to do will vary.  Transition may involve:   Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT, also called Exogenous Endocrine Intervention or EEI), where the person will take cross-sex hormones and/or medications to block the hormones already within their body. dressing and grooming in a manner more aligned with their gender identity asking people to address and refer to them with a new name and pronouns (he/she/they etc) updating legal documentation to reflect chosen name and pronouns Various surgeries, including, but not limited to, breast augmentation or reduction/removal, vaginoplasty (for trans women) or phalloplasty/metiodoplasty (for trans men), cosmetic surgery to masculinise or feminise facial bone structure, etc."

asktransgender,3dthny,illuminess,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:57:16 2015 UTC,"Despite what we choose regarding transition, it still comes down to innate identity which we can't control. I see being transgender as a developmental issue, so it's no more a choice than being gay. If a cis man took HRT the way we do, he would probably begin feeling very dysphoric and unstable, because he is not wired for it. For us, it makes us feel calm and normal. I wish I wasn't like this, but it is what it is, and the only way to feel happy and sane is to transition."

asktransgender,3dqyo8,Hypatia_the_Wrathful,5,Sun Jul 19 13:00:20 2015 UTC,"EDIT: What does MTF to MTF have to do with (cis) LGB to T?  To be fair, it is not a dismissal of one's suffering. There do exist systematic, economic, and social privileges based on group status in our world. So on average, members of these groups will have to deal with privilege dynamics.   A gender minority of color is going to have more struggles on average than a white gender minority.  A wealthy gender minority will have less struggles on average than a gender minority in poverty.  A gender minority with no acceptance and no support will have more struggles on average than a gender minority with full family and community support.  In this day and age, being white, or wealthy, or in a circle of acceptance is a privilege to the gender minority worlds.  But I have no idea the context of which you say this.  If for example, let us say I absolutely need FFS to blend in, I'm in poverty, and I live in a hostile environment, and a wealthy gender minority who also needed FFS received hers in her first year and lived in a friendly environment, told me to just suck it up and go out there... She should check her privilege, because her entire setup and life is structured for hers to succeed whereas I'm set up to fail and need to fight for my life.  tl:dr There are most definitely privilege dynamics, and privileged groups within the GSM worlds. But we all suffer under the discrimination from being minorities, however some of us have much more privilege than others. EDIT: And I have an enormous amount of privilege, despite all my struggles. My struggles don't erase my privilege."
asktransgender,3dqyo8,emily_purdy_pants,9,Sat Jul 18 17:26:09 2015 UTC,"I think you are over simplifying and too strongly classifying types of struggles that trans people go through. Being a white trans person does not automatically mean you have less struggles than a minority trans person, and the same goes for wealth and other things. Just because it's generally true more often than not doesn't mean it's always the case."
asktransgender,3dqyo8,Hypatia_the_Wrathful,2,Sat Jul 18 17:46:39 2015 UTC,"There is such thing as white privilege in this world. Not all white people have it good, and not all people of color have to face discrimination everyday, however, on average, white privilege effects a majority of people of color's lives.  The same is true for all systematic imbalances of power creating privilege.  Your point is not a counter. There are exceptions, but exceptions don't change the average, they only point out nuances.   Just because it's generally true more often than not doesn't mean it's always the case.   EDIT: I believe what you're saying is what I'm saying, however, I am saying it is a privilege to be a member of these groups. Even if the privilege of being a member of these groups is not leveraged, it is still there to be leveraged at anytime. And just because someone is not experiencing someone taking privilege over them for being in the minority, does not mean that it can't happen at any moment, because it could happen to them at any moment. Privilege does not necessarily imply leveraging it. It shows the systematic social structures we live in.

asktransgender,3dqyo8,Amy_of_Dallas,4,Sat Jul 18 19:15:33 2015 UTC,I think one of us must be misreading the other.  I said that it was mostly older transitioners on the receiving end of the accusations... I'm confused now.
asktransgender,3dqyo8,kelli_with_an_i,2,Sat Jul 18 20:25:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we might be crossing wires. Do you mean older in the sense that they were older when they started or older in the sense that they transitioned a long time ago? I've seen such behavior from both. Both have unique struggles- it is frankly easier now than it was 20 years ago, and those (like me) who are later on in life when we start have to deal with more years of the opposite sex hormone and a different journey in terms of self acceptance and social integration.  Not that it matters. I think we need to focus more on support and inclusion than further dividing ourselves."

Trans men were welcome but my cis female partner and I were asked to leave by a woman who knows us. And there were trans men there. Why they would participate in group that excludes half of the trans community alludes me.   I can count the number of gay men who are accepting of me on my fingers. Older gay men tend to act like we owe them for allowing the T to be included in the LGB and younger gay men I have met use derogatory terms and act as though I am the jerk for being offended.

This is what seriously pisses me the fuck off about those born women events. I can get people who aren't trans being ignorant and bigoted. I can't get someone who is trans supporting those behaviors. It really makes me feel like I want nothing to do with them. They can go fuck off, and I hope they never try and advocate for trans rights, because they have no proper understanding of how trans people are discriminated against if they are in fact supporting these events.   Though in this case the bigotted lesbians are also particular bad. It's common practice to let those into your circles when you are honoring them. Even if they would normally be excluded. Not letting in trans women to an event that honors dead trans individuals, and trans women being the bigger targets of violence and murder. Well that just seems stupid."

If we are the gender we say we are, then we always were. Regardless of if we knew it or not. So trans women were always female. And if they can't accept that, then they really aren't accepting any trans person. Just because of their genitals at birth.   It really is patriarchal as you pointed out.

But over the time, I learnt that she is still considering me as a male referers to me as ""him"" and treats accordingly. She has many of LG friends and I've met them too. But I got a strong feeling that none of them does consider me as a woman but more as a man in the dress, an impersonator who wants to sneak into womens bathroom. Her L-friends said to me probably the most insulting words I've ever heard, G-friends are more friendly but I always felt I dont like to be around them. Something was wrong may be they are too concetrated on sex or being open and proud or may be they think I am the same but just too shy to be open as a gay male.

They've said some of the worst things, and the most dismissive things. And historically, like it or not, the facts are, a lot of the hate towards gender minorities, stems from sexual minorities throwing us under the bus in the last century. I feel like their cultures still have deep threads of phobic and even outright hateful thought lines in them. Whether they see it or not.  I always get the vibe from the LG that it is ""don't worry little t, we'll take care of you, and tell you what you are ""really."""" And it's like fuck off and stop equating sexuality minority with gender minority, and thanks for erasing us at the start of your movement and then making shemale troupes and terfs to block our medical care.  Yup, sometimes the LG are the worst, and historically they caused a lot of social problems we have today. And honestly, many of them still other us and invalidate us, just in more subtle ways than they used to.  This is why I used GSM over LGBT. I'm not a sexuality minority, nor do I agree with what their movement did to us gender minorities in the past. This why I say gender minority over transgender. And also this is why I say gender majority, because cis LG are gender majorities, and have thrown their privilege of being so all over our existences for many, many decades."

T's are hyper politically correct and instead of turning ignorant cis-ist statements into an oppotunity of learning and compasion they blame the offender of being sexist and attack.  I cannot tell you how many times my friends have come to me for a sound and non-judgmental explanation of what they did wrong to have (another trans aquiantence) get pissy and block them on facebook. Often times it comes down to a misunderstanding in the technical differences in the terminaology being used or just innocent ignorance from someone that didnt spend their life immersed in the shifting PC terms and thier specific meanings.

As for lesbians, I honestly don't know many of them... but the ones I do know tend to be staunch feminists who often sound very angry.  Not to say that this is the norm... far from it, I believe.  I pass no judgement.  If we're to understand each other, I believe we should understand their point of view first.  The LGB community has been marginalized much like us, maybe not as much so for sure.  But let's face it... our plight is foreign to them.  For them, the fight has always been about sexuality... fur us, it has always been about identity.  They understand us no more than straight people understand us.  To put it short, we're seen as freakish to them as a straight person sees us as freakish.  What was it again?  Minorities often bully other minorities to find a sense of power that they were never given.  How do you change that?  First, you fight back, second, you try to establish a sense of understanding.

But every time I come, there's 3 or 4 people there who give me dirty looks, point at me, laugh at me, and say openly racist shit in front of me. Yet, no one else seems to have a problem with it, they only call them out on it because it's socially expected of them. If I'm really welcome at your dinner parties, why are you still inviting them? You don't see me being hateful towards anyone, why do they get to stay at the expense of my comfort and safety? That's what lesbian spaces are to me.  Or it could be like last night where I went to dinner with some friends, and a lesbian couple at the table next to us, kept turning and staring at me and laughing and then talking quietly while not breaking eye contact, and laughing some more.  Yeah, I've been taught through experience that if I run into a lesbian anywhere, there's a good chance my identity will be questioned, mocked, invalidated. Fuck that.  I give everyone a chance. Im just running out of the desire to give chances to lesbians,  because Im tired of being hurt."

The only reason they tolerate trans men there is that they don't believe we are men and just see us as misguided lesbians. You wouldn't catch me dead at an event like that. I honestly don't know why any trans men would want to be part of that environment.   That said, I'm no spokesperson. I can't claim to speak the opinion of all trans men, I can only share how I feel. Trans men are just as diverse as cis men the same way that trans women are just as diverse as cis women.  I know that typically trans women face more discrimination and risk of violence than trans men and I want to do whatever I can to help prevent these negative things, not add to them."

And that's before you even get to the discrimination part.  I don't think we should be supporting anything that discriminates against half our population (or whatever the amount is). Discrimination in any form shouldn't be tolerated and by attending that is saying, ""This is ok with me."" I couldn't do that."

If it was described as ""for women"" wouldn't attend those events myself, not being a woman, and I'd be annoyed if someone invited me to one.   If there was a reasonable justification for it being for afab people (I don't know, a meeting about reproductive health for people with those bits?), and was described in an inclusive way, I might even attend.  For the Transgender Day of Remembrance, though, and excluding trans women? That's horrible. Any trans man who lets that slide is betraying the community and I'd tell him as much."

asktransgender,3drj5a,batshiatbadger,15,Sun Jul 19 03:16:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know how it is with MTF transpeople, but I know that a lot of the FTM trans* community has a lot of variation as far as gender identity goes. Not everyone goes on hormones, gets surgeries or changes their name. Just from my experience on /r/ftm and in college, I noticed quite a bit more people who were born female identified as genderfluid or genderqueer. Some of these people felt the need to use male pronouns, others didn't care; some wanted hormones, some didn't. It really depends on the person and their situation.  I doubt I would go to an event like this. I don't want to surround myself with women who believe I will only ever be a woman. I know there's a feminine subreddit (cough /r/gendercritical cough) that spouts shit like, ""No matter what hormones or surgery they take, they'll never be a real man/woman."" I feel like what goes on in that subreddit would be like going to this type of event.  To close, the most I can guess as to why trans* individuals have attended these events is that maybe they felt comfortable going there, or maybe they identified somewhere else on the trans* spectrum.  Oh, and you're making a big assumption saying that those FTM individuals support the discrimination of MTF women. For all you know, they weren't aware of that rule. I know I would be the type of person to hear about some event and not ask about the details regarding who exactly is allowed if I know I'm allowed to go. Like, if I heard about a music festival I wouldn't ask if it's 21+ because I don't need to worry about being eligible for that requirement (I'm 22)."

You have encountered Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminism, known colloquially as TERF. It's a distinct subset of modern academic feminism. Some big names in TERF activist circles are Sheila Jeffreys, Janice Raymond and Cathy Brennan. They believe that trans women are not and never will be women. Some people in the LGBT community consider them to be like the Westboro Baptist Church of feminism. There's lots of info out there if you want to do some research.  Personally I find them to be offensive on many levels, much like SWERFs  (Sex Worker Exclusionary) in the sense that they decry the ""patriarchy"" for labeling people as they see fit, and then proceed to label people as they see fit."

We're all individuals. There are black people who are homophobic, there are gay people who are racist, there are trans people who are sexist, etc. We're all just people, and we're all flawed in different ways. Some FTM people wouldn't dream of attending an event like that, not only because it'd trigger them possibly, but also because it's cruel as hell to deny trans women. Some FTM people might go and not be aware of the discrimination, and some might go and not give a damn, because some people are just like that.  If you don't want to hate FTMs, don't. It's not difficult, there are a hell of a lot of us, and I don't think most of us attended these events. I've seen MTFs misgender and insult FTMs, but I don't hate them. People are just people, life is a lot less stressful when you don't judge an entire group for the actions of individual crappy people who happen to belong to a certain group.   But to answer the question, I'd never go to an event like that. I wouldn't feel comfortable because it's like I'm saying that I'm not male, or I'm still joined to being female somehow. But also I wouldn't go to an event for women where women are banned from attending because they weren't born with the same body parts or chromosomes or whatever else.

Okay since everyone else has given you amazing answers (and yeah, I count myself amongst the guys who basically said ""over my cold, dead body"") I'm going to tackle this one: This doesn't sound too good. You sound like you're blaming the majority of trans men for the actions of a few. This sounds exactly like TERFS who hate all trans women because some crossdressers happened to get caught and charged with peeping in the women's bathroom. This attitude is not okay, and the pushback from a small set of trans women (on tumblr mostly) who think it's okay to hate trans men because ""vague transmisogyny"" is not cool.

That's terrible reasoning. Black people are statistically more likely to be involved in crime. Does that give you the right to become prejudiced against them?  Also, the guys who go to these ""womyn born womyn"" (shudder) events are in the overwhelming minority, as I think the responses prove. It's statistically impossible to find a group of marginalized people and love every single one of them. There's a trans lady at my local trans meetup. I hate her. She gets under my skin like no other. I idly fantasize about backing her over with my car when she just doesn't shut the hell up about shit she has no experience with and pretends to be the ""layman's expert"" about stuff. The one thing I do not hate her for? Being a trans woman. This is the same thing. You cannot hate a group of diverse people who are all individuals.    But really I know at least a few, I didn't mean I'd hate all FTM people, but I don't even want to hate a subgroup of FTM people. That's why I was trying to get peoples reasoning and justifications.    You can think that the guys who go to these events are a little effed in the head. I do. I would never support it. But I also wouldn't hate these men based on one thing in their lives. We all come problematic places. I used to be transphobic in my teens as a reactionary measure to cover how miserable I felt in my body, because I stupidly thought that real trans people knew by like age 5 that they were trans. I know a lot of trans people who went through the same phase. I would think anyone who used those short years to define me as a person would be closed minded and wrong. This is no different."

The point was that people naturally create assumptions based on past experiences. And assuming the numbers were so large that the majority of FTM people would attend such events (Though they don't seem that large), then it might be hard not to assume at least sometimes. I wouldn't act on such assumptions, I know better than that, but mentally the feeling might exist. Like maybe a nagging feeling. I don't necessarily mean the thought that all people of a certain group do this thing. I meant like the negative mental associations your mind links with groups that have wronged you.   I was really rushed with my original explanation in response to you. I don't feel it does my thoughts justice.

(Not claiming they're good reasons, but they are human ones.) For me it's triggering even thinking about it as a non-op guy. It feels like these people are reducing gender and sex to what is between my legs, which, to be frank, doesn't look all that female anymore anyway. I have a feeling most trans guys feel the same way. It's definitely a shitty practice, and trans guys would be some of the first people to tell you that. I try to stay away from anything that has a whiff of radical feminism anyway."

I wouldn't go to an even that said, ""All Americans"" but then ""no Jews"" or ""no blacks"" - I'm definitely not going to a women's event that doesn't actually welcome all women.  I would not be able to respect an FTM person that went to that kind of event, unless they were going to actively protest that bullshit. Which, to be fair - has indeed been done.  And holding an event for the TDoR for only transmen is totally bullshit.   This seemed particularly cruel as trans women are half of the people being remembered.

In a single-sex school, I was rarely made aware of my assigned gender. We were just students. Whereas once there were boys around and they made it clear that they didn't see me as one of them, and I kept being grouped together with the girls for P.E. and whatnot, I pretty much spent every second mired in crippling dysphoria and depression and jealousy and played truant whenever I could."

My reasoning was simply that while I didn't feel comfortable or identify as female, I was afab and was currently in a relationship with a women who identified as a lesbian for 6 or so years and these events were places I felt safe. It wasn't all that uncommon for ftms to identify with the lesbian community early on and I'm not sure how common it is now, but when I was figuring shit out it was very common for ftms to hold onto the lesbian label and to still be heavily involved in lesbian communities.  I didn't then nor do I now feel terribly comfortable in the gay or trans communities and while I never called myself a lesbian it was a community I found myself in for a good majority or my life and was the group that was the most supportive of me while coming to terms with everything; even though I didn't identify with them I felt comfortable and safe with them, which was far more important for me then isolating myself because they slighted one portion of the community.   I didn't feel safe or welcome in the GBT communities or at their events but the more radical lesbians in my area were very welcoming up until the time that I went stealth.

Same with all the lesbians who date trans guys and trans guys who date lesbians. If you're dating a trans guy and crying that you still identify as a lesbian and morn the loss of being obviously lesbian when going out with your partner, you're a disgusting plague on humanity.   I accidentally went to some of these thinking they were either LGBT events or Trans events and all they do is bitch about cis guys, these things do not pass the bechdel test. The trans guys there are usually non-binary fruit cakes looking to talk about feminism and the power of their vaginas. I didn't see guys who weren't advertising their trans status and I was very uncomfortable being outed as FTM just by attending.    I've heard trans guys crying that it's so hard to leave the lesbian community so they go to these things. Call me an asshole, but maybe those guys should have stayed lesbians if they wanted to be apart of that crowd. Maybe they should quit being pussies, hiding behind their vaginas, and grow a pair, man up, to join the ranks of the straight guys that they apparently identify as and respectfully keep out of women's business."

If you just happen to find their physic attractive despite them being men, which some trans men have feminine features. I know people say they 'pass' better, maybe they do, but they still sometimes have feminine features. And I can't blame someone for being attracted to someone who identifies as a man, but looks feminine if they are only attracted to women. But at the same time I'd have to question why that wouldn't make the trans man a little warded out, but maybe he just likes her and doesn't care.   And I've heard of lesbians dating and marrying cis men, if they happen to be attracted to that one specific man. Or they just really like their personalities. You can marry people who you don't get super aroused by physically. I'm not sure the nicest way to put it, but people who aren't conventionally attracted can still find love.   And in those cases if they are still as a rule attracted to women, well I can see why they'd still identify as lesbian.  I do also get a bit why trans men might not like losing the communities you are a part of. I don't like losing most of my friends who I played football with, or who I was in the Boy Scouts with. I don't like the idea of them rejecting me. I may not have really been a boy, but I didn't properly understand that at the time. But at the same time I think like you said they should just accept it. I mean I accept I might not be so welcomed by the people I mentioned before, but in general I'm not going to even bring it up, because it's something I've accepted and am willing to move on with."
asktransgender,3drj5a,Flower_Fairy,2,Sun Jul 19 05:50:37 2015 UTC,"What a coincidence then that so many of these lesbians are attracted to just one man and he so happens to be the kind of man who was born with a vagina. They don't then stop and go: ""Oh my, I'm attracted to a man, I guess that means I'm bisexual!"" And they usually don't happen to just be attracted to him and then find out that he's trans. They always seem to meet these guys in a context where they get clue'd in on him being trans first.    Then they're his biggest advocate and let everyone (their lesbian friends) know that the guy they're dating is a trans man, ""Oh but he's all man to me, there's no difference between him and any other guy!"" And then turn on a dime to bitch about cis men and how much better trans men are because they understand women so much better.    What you're doing is giving a category of people the benefit of the doubt, when in aggregate, you could only reasonably chalk a few cases of this up to happenstance.    Would you feel comfortable playing on a men's team or volunteering for a man/boy mentoring program rather than the female equivalents now? Your friends rejecting you (fuck them btw) is completely separate from events and groups you participate in."
asktransgender,3drj5a,4riadn3,0,Sun Jul 19 06:04:58 2015 UTC,"Well they might have common reasons for it. But I am giving them the benefit of the doubt for now as I haven't seen it in huge numbers, only heard about it. And I've not seen any numbers or anything, but if you've first hand experience you'd probably know better than me I guess.   And well as for the mentoring thing. I don't have that much lived experience as a women yet. I think I'd rather prefer working with a girl, but at the same time I doubt I'd know that much. So I'd probably just avoid that. But that's for other reasons. As for sports yeah I'd prefer female teams. But honestly at this point I don't think I'd like sports much at all, but that's besides the point."

I think the transition to whatever gender is something unique to 'birth' gender so terms like DMAB, AMAB, DFAB, and A FAB are coming into popular use.  For many years the binary model was seen as inescapable. Most of medical research and professionals are still stuck there. Like I have an MD that is totally cool with they pronouns and my genderqueer transition but my therapist is more binary model.  Still slips up to say she or he and keeps asking me if I want to change my name to a more feminine one.  For me, my journey is not having words to describe what I felt. I was in a binary military world and when I finally talked to someone it was MTF.  I also think it was a bit of escapism from 'boy mode' me.  Now with a few years in and more knowledge of myself and the gender clusterf*ck that used to be a binary.. I am definitely GQ. A bit fluid, but not just a woman and definitely not a man.  Some difficulty comes in because it doesn't seem the world is ready for people who don't want to check male or female. I get weird looks walking into the male and female restroom. So what I don't exist or I just should not pee?  It is hard to operate in the binary world and not feel invalidated.  Also some binary trans people have great importance on passing or hopes of going stealth. So when we GQ break the mold, there is some resentment."

Or the national movements for gender neutral bathrooms. The Senate bills for gender neutral language.  Also the largest student and community resources in my area no longer use MTF or FTM in their literature. Also the recent LGBT training at the hospital in work in addressing the gender spectrum.  Or the two Facebook gender therapist groups that I comoderate having much less binary questions from the public than two to three years ago.

I'd say for me personally the genderqueer part happens because I am not totally certain in my gender. I have days with doubts and days where I feel as if I'm nothing at all. The FTM part describes my physical body - although I am afab I would MUCH MUCH prefer to have a cis male (or cis male esque) body as my canvas.

Look at more than just today to see with more perspective why you are where you are.  You can see or think now of years of dysphoria leading up to now.  It is okay to panic.  On the flip side. Nobody but you can say you should do it or not. It might not be your time.. but do think on all the steps and months of getting to this point.

So far I still am going through periods of denial but I haven't been displeased or feeling any more dysphoria because of my hormones, so I'm continuing. They sort of proved my ""trans-ness"" to myself a bit more. You could probably try what I've done, if there's not any major consequences.

asktransgender,3dtksl,MissDaisy9001,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:53:42 2015 UTC,"Well a lot of times it's typical to start one medication without the other. Though I think it's preferable to start blocking T first, but on the other hand E suppresses T to a degree, so maybe they want to see how much it will effect it. I don't know. But regardless of their reasons it is safer to start with one medication in case it has complications. That way you don't have to try and figure out what is causing the problem.   That being said if they continue to just give you E with no antiandrogen then that's probably not very wise. I'd talk to them about it if it persists. In theory you could just have E do all the work of suppressing T, and feminizing your body on it's own. However that increases risks, and really isn't recommended."

Transsexual can have negative connotations for some of us, since it makes it sound like it has something to do with sexual orientation. It also isn't gender specific.  Second, /u/asdasdblah is right. Everyone is different, so it's hard to make generalisations. Heck, even some (many?) cis women have wide shoulders. It doesn't make them any less of a woman, and if you turn out to have wide shoulders, it doesn't make you any less of a woman either."

Patches are suboptimal because they don't stick as well as you would hope, one girl got a rash, and then you have to be careful horizontal dancing. ;).  Injections are a great option weekly, I heard a few girls say that every other week means some mood swings.  Also some people don't like needles or get to the moment of giving themselves their first shot to realize it is a no go.  Pills, you have to remember each day but super easy to take. There are also some sublingual (under the tongue) that are supposed to be easier on the liver... But if you are under care of a doctor there isn't much of a matter.  I decided on pills because already taken some for thyroid so it wasn't much to remember. also, I was worried about carrying syringes, etc. When I am bike-camping, etc.  Edit: doc told told me there is no significant difference in efficacy."

Now the not sticking problem is gone, and I don't have glue circles anymore."
asktransgender,3dsjak,ISayUntoThee,3,Sun Jul 19 01:48:09 2015 UTC,"Patches are annoying, but have the steadiest and most predictable absorption rate out of the available options. I've been using them for just shy of 2 months so far and while it is clear that they are having the desired effect, they're very inconvenient. They limit your bathing significantly, leave circles of glue around them that stick to underwear and pick up lint and basically just leave a dark circle around wherever they were. plus after a few days they start to make crinkly noises as they lift and buckle, so hiding them under clothes becomes just a little harder.   pills are processed by the liver and have the least reliable absorption rate due to the digestive tract and varying delay between dosage and full breakdown in the stomach, but they are also the easiest option since you will likely be taking an androgen antagonist, probably spirolactone, so its not even something extra to remember. They are also generally the least expensive option available.  Injections are generally weekly or bi-weekly and administered intramuscularly, so into the thigh or similar area (I think) or possibly the bum, I'm not certain, you don't need to seek a vein so as long as your hands are steady it shouldn't hurt too much and shouldn't leave much of a mark or any scarring over time since you change injection sites every time. the absorption rate for injections varies significantly person to person and depends on which injectible you use (there are 2 main drugs and one other that's not commonly used anymore). They're also hard to get in some places and more expensive then the other options generally, and by hard to get I mean they don't produce it for Canada any longer, it has to be prepared at a compounding pharmacy. In the US from what I've read it's available in most places commercially but compounding pharmacies are less expensive.   Overall due to my personal situation and preference I'm trying to move to injections and should be able to in about 2 weeks. Sticking myself with one of them every week or two will be something to get used to, but given that I'll be taking E in some shape or form for the remainder of my life, I would rather stick a needle into a leg 52 times a year then wear a patch or take a pill 365 days/times."

At this point, I keep to a schedule to prevent wet dreams and to keep size in preparation for GRS at some point."
asktransgender,3dw17f,woodchuckchuk,10,Mon Jul 20 00:23:41 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between having a preference/interest and having a fetish.  In my experience, when people talk about men with ""Yellow Fever"", they're usually referring to men who objectify East Asian women and reduce to them to their ""exotic"" appearance or culture. A ""chaser"" is someone who does the same thing to trans women, someone who reduces trans women to their ""exotic"" genitals and objectifies them for it. I think there are also chasers who treat trans men similarly, although they are less common.  These fascinations are often associated with problematic beliefs -- for example, many men with Asian fetishes claim that they prefer Asian women because of how (supposedly) quiet and subservient they are compared to loud, entitled, feminazi white women. For trans people, chasers are associated with a belief that trans women are ""like women, but less crazy"", or that they'll have more in common because they ""used to be men"", and with the belief that trans women all have functional penises that they enjoy using for sex. Chasers are also sometimes associated with internalized transphobia.  On top of all of the usual objectification problems that come with fetishes, for trans people there is also an additional component -- many of them hate that they're trans and/or hate their genitals. At least when you fetishize an Asian women, she probably isn't ashamed of being Asian. Many (though not all) trans women are ashamed of being trans, and it's a shitty feeling to be sought after by people who reduce your entire existence to that upsetting fact."

asktransgender,3dw17f,redsectoreh,6,Mon Jul 20 00:48:32 2015 UTC,"Being blonde or brunette isn't a painful experience that makes people want to kill themselves.  Guys who fetishize asians usually do so because they buy into stereotypes about asian women being more feminine or submissive than western women, or they watch a lot of asian porn so they think they can only be attracted to that type of person.  I know that's not always the case- maybe some guys just prefer asian features, or maybe he just happened to date several asians as a coincidence, but girls can usually tell when guys have warped preconceptions about them, and when they are being fetishized.  Women want to be treated as fellow equal humans, not stereotypes or sex objects.  Most guys who specifically seek out trans women don't really care about their feelings.  They don't bother to do any research about trans people, and they often don't seem to grasp that most of us DO NOT LIKE being trans and many of us have difficulties with sex because of dysphoria.  They want to recreate a fantasy they got from watching unrealistic porn.  Maybe you are different, but creepy morons post here almost daily and that's what trans women are used to dealing with on okcupid and places like that.  That's why chasers are stigmatized, not just with trans people but every other minority that gets fetishized."
asktransgender,3dw17f,Isaac_The_Khajiit,0,Mon Jul 20 01:02:47 2015 UTC,"The only time they're considered a chaser is when they want only trans women, if they're interested in cis women as well they're not a chaser. You could have preference but any time you look exclusively for a man, woman or another gender with a certain things whether it be a feature, a characteristic etc. you are a chaser."

Maybe this person just wanted to express support and didn't know how else to do it.  Yes, we are just doing what we feel is right for us and it can seem weird for someone to make a big deal of it. But the reality is that it DOES take courage to stand up and be ourselves in modern society. We can't expect cis people to understand every aspect of being trans but I'll take a cis person who awkwardly praises me over one who insults me any day. The underlying message is still one of support and acceptance, and for me, that's more important."

( You that the opposite is the case, I know that as well, but probably your mum doesn't.) Most poeple don't think about trans.   I said she seemed supportive because she did seem like that at first.   My parents told me, they were prepared if my brother or I came out as gay. But they weren't prepared for their son being their actual daughter. So give them a little time to think. I wish you all the best. It will go on. You won't be stuck. Never give up hope.

The very first piece of women's clothing I tried on was a pair of jeans at banana republic. They fit horribly and even more horrible than how those jeans looked on me I walked out with them right in front of a store employee who asked me if they worked alright. Even more horribler was when he said ""you're aware these are women's jeans?"" I said yes and he was just kind of like ""yeah cool man"" and that was that.  Then I went to a DKNY store that turned out to sell nothing but women's clothing. The store employees were are very professional about it and even helped me find a few different cuts before I found one that I thought looked good. So I bought them and no one, not the male employee that was helping me, the other female employee working nearby, or the women who were in the store or changing rooms gave me a second look.  Bottom line is, I'd give it a 98% chance that no body cares, if someone does it's their problem not yours. When people insult me (which only happens in my small home town) I reply back with very childish insults. ""Get away from me your so ugly"" is my favorite because I mean come on, that's just a ridiculous thing for one adult to say to another. I try to have fun with it :)"

It's hard not to feel this way and, in some very real ways it's an unfortunately correct view of the world. There are very few people who manage to transition in our society without something painful happening. That said, there's a lot of joy in getting to slowly reveal yourself and be truer than you expected you'd ever be able to.  But let's move past that. There is so much here to cover and I'll try to offer some hope too. Based on what you've said, you've told your wife about your feelings and it hasn't gone well? Marriages in this scenario are always complicated and I agree with the poster below that therapy (find someone with specific experience with trans people) is going to be a big help. I don't know you or your wife and, without more specifics can only guess what your relationship is like. It's not common, but it is possible to maintain a marriage though transition but it requires a lot of hard work.  Perhaps more comforting, even if your marriage isn't something that can endure, it's reasonably likely that you can establish a mutual parent relationship with your wife. With some hard work and honesty, you'll get to see your daughter regularly. And she'll know you as mom. Someday someone's gonna ask her how she feels about having a trans mother and the only thing she'll be able to say is ""I can't compare it to anything. It's the only thing I've ever known.""  I'm happy to keep talking but I'm unsure of what to say. Is any of this helping? Or am I just making it worse?"

There have been several times lately where it's caught up to me, the gravity of what all these thoughts might mean and where they might take me. I don't want to lose my job, my friends, my family....really the life I have built even if that life is missing the real me. It hurts to think about and I am still fighting against what sometimes feels like an inevitability. And really, I'm the most self conscious person in the world so it's terrifying to think about myself going through transition....to know people will probably notice it, judge me, hold opinions about me that I can't control.

Firstly, here's a sub for MTFs; it might help you answer any questions you might have, not feel alone, gain support and confidence, etc: https://www.reddit.com/r/mtf  So, the main thing is just to figure out what you want and where you want to go with it. If you want to, try to find a female name that you like, that you think might suit you. Talk to yourself, talk about yourself, use female pronouns, just get used to it.  The journey is pretty customisable. Do you want to come out before you start to transition or whatever? Do you want to try embracing your femininity/female self more before you come out? Etc. It's all your own choice, and no-one can really give you an answer, because it depends on what's going to make you happy and comfortable. But as long as you have a good support group in your life (either friends, family, or even an online community), you can figure it all out with as much time as you need."

""  It sucks but really the only way out is through and forward.  I'd suggest you a) find friends/other social support you can be yourself with and b) make plans to how you want to deal with coming out to those who are currently your friends.   It's good to have social support any time we go through tough periods like this, and you honestly don't know how people will react.  Basically, for me, I was unsure how the people in my life would react, so I started by gaining new friends and allies who knew me only as someone intending to transition (I still presented male, but they respected my female identity nonetheless), making sure to have at least a little support nailed down, then very slowly started coming out to those who had known me, and while I was lucky in that my friends turned out mostly to be cool with it, for those that didn't, or my family, it was important to have that initial support (both through friends and professionals like my therapist) to fall back on when things got really hard.

I think one thing you might want to do is try and find an LGBT community in your area. Especially if you can find a trans group, they will definitely be supportive and you can talk to them about all this stuff that is bothering you. You will need to come out to your friends at some point, and it's not going to be easy, but at the same time, they're your friends and they should be supportive. I'm sure you've listened and helped them out with any problems that they've had. If they ignore you or don't support you, then they aren't really good friends to begin with."

If you live your life entirely for other people, you'd be miserable. It's OK to put your feelings first, and it's OK to make choices that benefit you rather than your friends. There's nothing wrong with that, it's healthy.  Being misgendered sucks. For some people, they can cope with it. My parents aren't accepting of me being trans, so I'm misgendered 24/7, and it hurts sometimes, but I'm mostly on autopilot now, so I can ignore it most of the time. For other people, you know, it ruins their entire day.   I can only suggest you consider telling them. If you do and they don't accept you, they're crappy friends anyway. If they do accept you, or they try to, then think how much of a relief that'll be. It's your choice, but you have to do what's right for you. Hell, maybe you can try to make some new friends while getting out of the 'guy' image your friends are still associating you with. If you be yourself, introduce yourself as your gender and chosen name, maybe it'll give you the confidence to come out to your current friends.

I probably should have thought things through a little more, trying to raise trans issues in conversation and seeing how different people responded, and chosen that one to be the first I told and let that guide me through the rest.  That probably would have alterted me to the fact that they already had an openly trans person in the group, and the topic just hadn't come up.  Instead I just pretty much immediately told my closest friend int he group because I was desperate for someone nearby that knew and would support me, and thankfully that went well.    Came out to the rest of them at a game night after said friend indirectly pointed out a good opening to that conversation and I took it.    I wouldn't recommend rushing to tell someone, while it worked for me I'm pretty sure I just got lucky.  I'd try getting some trans discussions going, perhaps a discussion about Orange is the New Black, or Sense8, or Caitlyn Jenner, or something like that.  Gauge peoples reactions, and figure out who would be safest to tell/most supportive.  If it gets too hard to keep it in before you've done that, whoever you are closest to is probably your best bet.  Less certain to be ideal, but it's the best way to at least avoid a worst case."

asktransgender,3dp6s1,chibistarship,41,Sat Jul 18 06:43:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this really is getting problematic.  A post by a trans woman looking for the experiences of trans women, ""how DARE you not include trans men!"" (edit: yes, including the men is important, though I see no problem in a person of a demographic using a wider platform to ask people of their demographic for experiences)  Several posts and comment chains questioning the legitimacy of any form of nonbinary identity, crickets."
asktransgender,3dp6s1,Hurts_,10,Sat Jul 18 03:03:55 2015 UTC,"When we mention ""be inclusive"" it's to all identities. If there was a comment that mentioned trans men but left out other identities when telling someone to be inclusive from the us mods. I apology.  If you catch us doing it by all means call us out on it.  With that said it's impossible to watch the all of the sub at all times. That's why reporting is so important. If you see a comment or post that is not inclusive or invalidates someone. or breaks any of the rules. Please report it."

asktransgender,3dp6s1,Wannabkate,12,Sat Jul 18 03:36:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's fine. Posting it like this does allow us to make a statement on the matter for other people to see.

I don't look through every question and every comment so reports are essential to being able to catch everything we can. There may be a lot of mods but we do miss things and sometimes we forget that we're mods and forget about looking out for things that break the rules (or at least I do) so reporting them is very helpful."

I know it sucks, but much like any minority it takes work to be recognised. I wish it wasn't like that, but things tend to waterfall instead of being completely equal from the get-go.

asktransgender,3dp6s1,BuffyCreepireSlayer,6,Sat Jul 18 03:17:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for bringing this up.  I'm a non-binary person. I spent the last 19 years calling myself a Transgender Woman, when quite honestly, that label doesn't fit me very well.  I only finally realized very recently, that there were other people 'like me'.. who were trans - people who weren't their assigned birth gender, who wanted to transition, but who didn't want precisely the other option either. In my 40's now, it's sometimes a challenge to wrap my brain around what 'other' gender options there are.. and I know that a lot of it is just finding out what I am, and letting the labels come from that. I'm not as young as the cool kids, and I don't have a tumblr account.  But as such a person, with let's just say an uncommon history, I only finally realized my own life's truth because a non-binary person posted a question here in this subreddit.  Since that event, I definitely have noticed a fair few posts coming through that are disparaging towards gender-variant people who fall outside the binary paradigm, and a lot of the language feels almost TERF-like... which hurts when I see it coming from ostensibly transgender people with similar lived experiences.  That said, I tend to browse new posts.. so I see stuff before the mods get to it, or before it's downvoted into oblivion. So I see a bit more of the negativity people post on various trans-related subreddits. But there's definitely more than a little of this sort of attitude being posted here and in other transgender related subs.   And as someone who's been on both 'sides' now.. it makes me sad.  Aren't we all just struggling in the dark to find people like us, and to find our answers, so we can live some small portion of a happy life?"
asktransgender,3dp6s1,BuffyCreepireSlayer,2,Sat Jul 18 09:33:24 2015 UTC,So like you I thought I  was just a trans woman. But I have come to realize that I am non binary and somewhat genderfluid. Most people are like what does that even mean!? Well my ID just mostly plays on the girlie side of things but likes to jump the fence and be macho sometimes. So I am a tomboy who can get super girlie with make up and fashion or get dirty with cars and guns. However I am still figuring out my ID from day to day. edit2 but I am not binary or so I have figured out. I don't  fully identify as a woman even though I feel strongly feminine.  I do have a bit of a male side and then there's something else that I dont know about. I am figuring out that part. and it does shift bit.  So yes this issue bothers me very much too. I want to see everyone get along. And just accept each other or at least respect each other. Its very frustrating.  edit1 btw I see someone doesnt agree with my ID. Well I just found this on nonbinary.org.. thats me to a Tea. =)
asktransgender,3dp6s1,BuffyCreepireSlayer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:06:38 2015 UTC,"That's why I linked the page from nonbinary.org. I feel it's hard to explain. And I am still learning how to do that. let me take another shot at it.  Gender is spectrum, And I am about 65-80% female in identity. which leaves my maleness about 10-15% on the average day. But I don't truly feel 100% female though I do feel feminine. the last 10% Idk. thats the part I am figuring out.  Anyway, some more rare days the male side does overpower my female side. and I feel manly. Also somedays I feel super fem. thats the fluid part.   So as far as the special snow flake thing goes. That's why most of the time I just say I am a trans woman because its easier than my shade of gray on the spectrum. or range of grays. also because when I finally socially transition I am going to have a female presentation/ expression.  So I guess it basically comes down to I feel female but I dont at the same time. I am not binary.  was that done better?  I am still very sick and I am gonna go rest for  a while. cough cough. Also this is not my best work because of loopiness. edit words"

What does this mean to you? If you became more female or more male, how would things change?  I don't know how to describe myself. I'm just gender confused. So I'm curious how other people reach conclusions like this."
asktransgender,3dp6s1,Alyssa_B,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:07:59 2015 UTC,Become more feminine or masculine. In gender identity or presentation or expression?   It's taken me a long time an soul searching to realize where I am as far as the spectrum.   And I am definitely trying to work on having a more feminine expression and presentation. As well as make my body as female as it can be.  It's definitely something that only you can answer for yourself.
asktransgender,3dp6s1,mygqaccount,4,Sun Jul 19 03:27:06 2015 UTC,"...well I can't speak for them, but you're certainly invalidating and insulting me with this post.   I think the hangup here is that most people have a many/girly day here or there, and some days you just want to be a non-gender amorphous blob that is fusing to your couch lol. Point being, if gender truly is a spectrum, then most people wont feel 100% of something, 100% of the time   You know, we're not idiots. We do know this. Nonbinary isn't ""oh I feel aligned with the male perspective today..."" or what have you. We have dysphoria, we transition (although many people don't transition out of fear or because constantly coming across stuff like your post is so exhausting, OR because they physiologically cannot transition in a way that relieves their dysphoria).   Imagine, if you will, feeling wrong in your body and in your gendered pronouns your whole life. I bet that comes easily enough. Then imagine that you try to transition to the opposite gender, and that feels just as wrong. The only way you can feel ""right"" is somewhere in between. Imagine the horror and fear of realizing that, not only are you transgender, you can't even be comfortable with yourself as either binary gender in an incredibly binary society. You will either live with dysphoria, or be very visibly trans for the rest of your life. Some binary folks don't pass, of course, so that's not exclusive to nonbinaries. Now imagine that even your closest friends won't use your pronouns because they're ""too hard."" Imagine that you go to the trans community only to be told, over and over again that who you are isn't real, that you're ""special snowflaking,"" and then they refuse to use your pronouns too.   You know how many times I've been gendered correctly? Exactly once. It was a bigot calling me ""it.""   So how about you cut it with the condescending bullshit, stop putting ""special"" in quotes, and stop telling us that it isn't a big deal and that who we are is ""extraneous.""  Christ. I have had it up to fucking here with this shit."
asktransgender,3dp6s1,gegenny,0,Sun Jul 19 03:58:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm hostile. Perhaps I shouldn't be. But if I came in here and started using male pronouns for you, would you perhaps be a touch hostile? What if I said, for example, the following?   I think the hangup here is that most men have a girly day here or there, and some days you just want to be a non-gender amorphous blob that is fusing to your couch lol. Point being, if gender truly is something you feel, then most people wont feel 100% of something, 100% of the time (in which case almost everyone would be MtF to some degree). But most of those people don't add that ""special"" label to themselves, and label their identity as the one that aligns with their genitals. It makes the label feel extraneous, and those who use it as trying to make an issue out of something that isn't a big deal.   If I said that, would you maybe feel hostile? What if you heard that sort of thing all the time, from the trans community, of all places? What if the community decided that only FtMs were legit, and MtFs don't real, and people said things like that to you all the time in the space that is supposed to be a haven for you?  I'm always surprised by how many trans people don't have empathy for this sort of thing."
asktransgender,3dp6s1,ErisC,2,Sat Jul 18 17:00:23 2015 UTC,"That wasn't an apology, that was ""Holy shit what's wrong with you? Sorry.""  I was honestly trying to convey exactly why it came off so wrong with my blockquote above. I'm trying to explain why that is so hurtful by flipping it around.   And you gotta understand my frustration here. This is a thread about how there's an awful thread saying we aren't real, and it turns into a bunch of people again telling us we aren't real. Kindly explaining things doesn't work. Logically explaining things doesn't work. Nothing works. And then when we're several layers deep in meta-enbys-aren't-real, I'm the asshole for getting mad."
asktransgender,3dp6s1,mygqaccount,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:39:13 2015 UTC,"well you were right about that I was explaining it in term of rolls/ presentation/ and traits. I should shy away from that. I was just trying to explain it in a way for people to get.  While most people dont perfectly fit into binary they still fall into that margin where they consider themselves binary. I dont. I fall outside that margin. And ya the labels are a bit much at times.  like I said I just say trans woman most of the time, to keep it from being complicated. and save myself from having to explain myself to everyone. Saying I'm a Demiwoman who is demi fluid, demisexual but gynoromantic is kinda much. And tends to turn people off.  also you were fine. or at least for me. I will let you know when you stepped over the line."
asktransgender,3dp6s1,Redbirdyellowbird,7,Sat Jul 18 18:00:07 2015 UTC,"I've always assumed non-binary falls under the trans umbrella. My understanding being that trans basically means identifying with something other than your assigned gender, sometimes non binary being no gender, that still counts.  So if we're going for inclusivity, then stuff should be directed at trans* people, not a binary mtf/ftm split.  Edit: also if youre someone hating on non binary genders or questioning their legitimacy of being called trans, then that's dumb. Dont do that"

Or just delete the comments saying they think Agender people are misusing the term? What exactly do you want mods to do?

asktransgender,3dp6s1,gegenny,16,Sat Jul 18 03:12:32 2015 UTC,"I think it's less that NB folks are snowflaking and more that snowflaking people tend to identify themselves as NB. My old university's trans group was about 90% people who identified themselves as NB but otherwise deviated in absolutely no way from standard norms, and who would immediately jump to ""well I'm trans and..."" in any discussion.  TL;DR: It's not NB people who are causin problems for trans folk, it's snowflakers causin problems for NB folk (and by extension for all of us)."

asktransgender,3dp6s1,mygqaccount,2,Sat Jul 18 05:32:58 2015 UTC,"My personal take is to assume first their identity is legitimate because it's theirs and not mine, and proceed with questioning from there. I might learn something, and even if I don't, if the person is just adopting an identity because they are being immature and want attention, it usually becomes apparent from their reaction or behavior.  Either way, their actions do not in any way reflect on me or how I identify. I know who I am and nobody will ever threaten that unless I allow it."
asktransgender,3dp6s1,mygqaccount,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:40:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I recently marched in a Pride parade because of my trans feelings but if anybody would have pressed me for details why I was there, I would have hid behind the Ally label - I'm just not in a place where I'm ready to be out to people in my daily life because I feel like that will push me way too fast into territories I'm not ready for.  But at the same time, TruTrans sort of judging makes me feel really distressed because I didn't have the standard Trans narrative that gets thrown about.  On one hand it does make me fear that I'm a special snowflake, on the other, it makes me feel like I'm being rejected from a minority that's fighting rejection from society (and I'm not sure how to explain that other than it makes my head feel like it's exploding).  I definitely feel like other people's opinion of you shouldn't matter if you have yourself figured out, but if you're still in the process of questioning who you are, it's pretty scary to see people claiming to be judge and jury of the Trans label invalidating other people's experiences just because they don't identify with them."

Yeah, having been in that spot myself, wandering thinking I was somehow broken because I wanted to be female but I clearly wasn't trans because I didn't follow The Narrative, it's not a fun place to be.  That and I've been wrong so many times about gender and learned so much by just asking questions and listening, I feel like telling people to shut up and that their stories are somehow damaging to other trans people makes us all poorer as a result."
asktransgender,3dp6s1,ErisC,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:32:47 2015 UTC,"I think even if they are ""special snowflaking"", which I assume just means acting in an immature and attention seeking way, isn't that just usually because of a) misinformation and/or b) some other problem that is driving their insecurity? I see no reason why you shouldn't give their identity respect, but then allow them to deal with the follow on consequences, and usually you'll either get at the root of the issue or they will nope out pretty quickly.   Even then, it's not how they identify but how they behave that is really the issue. In your example, those 90% of people might honestly be trans they might not, but using it as an excuse to end all discussion isn't a productive behavior, trans or not. In the same way, those that appropriate identities in order to speak for all members of that group are doing something wrong, not being something wrong. I don't speak for all trans people, either.  Either way, I don't think we as a community gain much by attempting to police our boundaries, and heck, if someone is willing to be counted as part of a marginalized group along with me and advocate for me, I don't really care, it shows we're making some progress, and I think we could all use some more strength of numbers. If they want to be a child about it, I think they need sympathy and a place to air whatever it is that's actually bothering them rather than an outpouring of hate.

From the tone I took it as ""delete it and burn it,"" which does seem to be your take, but I personally think a mod warning would spawn discussion and set a precedent for future posts.  Deleting it just erases both sides, whereas before, a mod putting their foot down spawned a 600 comment mod post where they set boundaries and rules. That's all I'm saying."

What does that actually mean to them? Does that mean they wish they could convert hydrogen into helium until they grow old, turn red and puff out their outer layers, slowly under intense pressure fusing increasingly heavier atomic nuclei, until either there is not enough mass to provide gravitational pressure or they reach a point of diminishing return with iron and die in a spectacular supernova or, for the truly massive, collapse into a singularity?  I might question whether they are just really anxious about their astrophysics homework, but I don't really have a place to prima facie claim they are ridiculous. If they are ridiculous, let their own claims and actions show it, it should be clear pretty quickly, and they don't need me shouting at them to do it.  Automatically dismissing stuff doesn't really get you anywhere except magnify the effect of preconceived notions. After all, most of us as trans people have had to deal with people dismissing our identities out of hand, because if you have a penis you're a guy and a vagina you're a woman, and anything else is ridiculous, amirite?"

My girlfriends parents don't really agree with me transitioning (though they use the right pronouns and name now) and so my gf's grandparents don't know (yet). So when they call her, she has to use the old name and stuff and sometimes is super confused when they ask ""hey how is [oldname]"".  It's kinda sad, because I liked them (I don't really have grandparents myself, as most of them died very young, and the one granddad left is never here) and now I can't see them anymore :/ (boymode is out of question, I don't have much/any facial hair left and my face turned to a female fat redistribution very fast.

Those darker hairs are dead, and will fall out over the rest of the month either on their own or as you shave. It does get better.

asktransgender,3dqdiw,amolinia,3,Sun Jul 19 02:21:30 2015 UTC,Over the years I have put various names on a shortlist. Mostly in the event that I would have a child at some point. Took the one out of that list that felt the most right for me...and then I took a second one as well because I always wanted a middle name.
asktransgender,3dqdiw,LinaKatharina,3,Sat Jul 18 13:43:41 2015 UTC,I picked a name for me long before I accepted me. When I did I threw this name away and chose the name my parents would have given me if genetics wouldn't have messed with my body.   I knew that name all my life and I knew that is my name.
asktransgender,3dqdiw,MayTentacleBeWithYee,3,Sat Jul 18 14:02:55 2015 UTC,"I chose one that defined how I felt at the time; like I didn't quite fit in anywhere. Plus, I had just watched some Torchwood, but shush. Sooooo, my name became Gray.  It's sorta funny, because my mother suggested that I use the masculine version of my original name, but I immediately said no (it sounds too ugly!). That, and a friend legitimately asked if I chose my name because of 50 Shades :("
asktransgender,3dqdiw,AnnieBruce,3,Sat Jul 18 17:32:37 2015 UTC,"I get to talk about my great grandmother again:)  Birth name is a Jr, and I share a first name(though not middle) with my paternal grandfather.  I wanted to maintain some of that continuity, though I dislike the feminine forms of my birth name, and while I've seen it used directly for women, it's extremely rare and feels weird to me, and I do want some change to mark the occasion.  But while I want some change, I want a clear link to the past.  So, Annie Bruce, my great granmothers first and middle names.  My paternal grandfathers mother, so keeping the name in the same family line preserves some of the continuity of ""Jr"", and symbolizing a link to the past, and bridge to the future, she was an immigrant from Scotland, the only immigrant ancestor of mine that I've known, and also the only person from the 19th century that I really knew(though I probably had met a few in passing during the 80s and possibly 90s)."

asktransgender,3dqdiw,asdasdblah,3,Sat Jul 18 18:44:17 2015 UTC,"I asked my parents.  Weird thing was that with me my parents had this super strong feeling they'd have a daughter, so they'd picked out a female name and everything, and got kinda surprised when I was born. With my brothers they never felt that way.  So a name was pretty much already chosen for me, and I really liked it and thought it was 100% me, so that became my new name."
asktransgender,3dqdiw,Day-of-Light,3,Sat Jul 18 18:46:57 2015 UTC,"My birth name has no equivalent for another gender and has no gender-neutral version, so I just tried out a few different names (I think 3 or 4) I liked until one stuck and felt ""right"". My chosen name, Sascha, has the advantage of (spelling-wise) seeming like a combo of Sacha and Sasha (both of which are used in my native language, though the former more than the latter), and thus coming off as gender-neutral. Also, I can say I'm named after Sascha Konietzko (which isn't entirely wrong), and that is awesome.  As for my middle name, I'm still unsure of what I'll choose. I'd like something that starts with an A, the first letter of my birth name. I have a few options in mind but haven't decided on one yet."

asktransgender,3dqdiw,Ziikh,2,Sat Jul 18 16:23:34 2015 UTC,"First I looked for names beginning with T, because that's the first letter of my birth name, but I hated all the names. So then I decided to look at where my birth name was on the list of popular names for the year I was born, then looked at the male equivalent to where my birth name was, but it was my cousin's name. Then I decided to pick a name beginning with J, because it's the name of my birth middle name and it's a cool letter. Made a list of the ones I liked, said them a bunch of times in front of the mirror, narrowed it down to the only one I felt flowed with my last name."
asktransgender,3dqdiw,Unwantable,2,Sat Jul 18 17:11:56 2015 UTC,"Long story, so I'll just paste what I wrote the last time this came up:  First off, I also decided to change my last name, too. I knew I wanted to get rid of my old last name even before accepting I was trans (it was an obscure variant form of an ethnic slur... even if it wasn't a slur, nobody could spell or pronounce it right). Also, up front I'll say that I'm not posting any of my old name here save the initials, and I'm not posting my current last name, either.  Anyway, I originally wanted to keep my initials (JGP), because I liked them. In my fantasies, I used ""Jessica Gail Park"" for a bit (this was years before accepting I was trans). I liked the name, but I had reservations. I also toyed around with ""Jadzia"" for a bit, after the DS9 character, but I rejected it as silly.  When I decided to go as a girl for Halloween 2009, I asked my mom what I would have been named if I were born a girl. She said she never picked out a name, but she always liked ""Amy"". Well, that brought back memories. It's always been one of my favorite names, I fell in love with it when I saw Honey I Shrunk the Kids at 5 years old, and it was the name of a very cool girl next door when I was in 3rd grade (I wanted to be her so bad...). So, at that point, I realized that I didn't need to keep my initials, and I've been Amy since.  Middle name was harder. I struggled for years. For a while, I wanted something with alliteration, so I considered ""Abigail"". Then, I started considering names that began with S, my favorite letter in the alphabet. I cycled through several of those: I considered ""Sigrid"" for a while (wouldn't work: I'm too Jewish and swarthy for that name), I liked ""Sophia"" (rejected when I started working with somebody with a variant on that name... it'd have been too weird, especially considering I was so jealous of her), and then I fell in love with the name ""Sunset"" hard. That one came really close: even when I publicly came out, I nearly signed off as ""Amy Sunset [lastname]"". It didn't help that I had a friend encouraging me to be creative with my middle name.  Ultimately, I started thinking about how I actually liked ""Jessica"" and how, as much as I love ""Amy"", I still wanted to use ""Jessica"" somewhere. I also realized I wanted to have at least one name ending in 'a'. I pretty much knew then that ""Jessica"" was my middle name. Still, though, I picked my best friend's brain and got him to rattle off a bunch of name ideas. I didn't like any of them, and that just confirmed it. ""Amy Jessica"" it is.  Last name was easier than I thought. I wanted something monosyllabic, common, and with no variant spellings or pronunciations. I couldn't find one I loved, though ""West"" came close. Ultimately, my best friend suggested I use the literal English translation of my mother's maiden name. It fit all my criteria except being common, but it made up for that by both being in the dictionary and being the name of a common household object. It was perfect, and I knew it when I tried to solicit more name ideas, but my heart wasn't in it.  Also, my new initials form a tri-ligature, so I have no regrets about the name I chose. Nothing else would have given me such awesome initials.  I still want to use ""Sunset"" somewhere, though. Maybe as a pen name or something."

asktransgender,3dqdiw,Stjesus,2,Sun Jul 19 05:15:31 2015 UTC,"It took me years to settle on a name. For a while, I was trying to find names that started with the same letter as my birth name to make it easier for people to adjust but then I said screw that. If it takes them longer to get used to, that's their problem. I had considered using names from fiction for a while since I don't like a lot of ""real world"" names and even went by a fictional name at one point. Then one day, I was on the bus and suddenly I thought, 'Sasha! That's perfect!' (well not those words exactly but you get the point)  What I'm trying to say with this story is that you can overthink things really easily. The right name will come to you and you'll know it when you hear/think it. Looking up names (this is a decent site for that) can help but can also lead to overthinking. Your new name should feel right. It should fit you and should be something you identify with. I'm not sure the best way to describe that feeling. Hope I'm making some sense here."

Glass in front of the window slightly distorting my face and hiding masculine features? Maam. Bad voice? Sir. Sees my hair from behind? Maam. I smiled in a feminine fashion and that's the first thing they saw? Maam. Once people gender you a certain way, they don't tend to change it unless you're really dead-middle to begin with. My friend calls it the 'box'. If you get put in the F box, you have to do a lot to get that person to see you as male unless they were suspicious from the beginning. Likewise, once people have seen you as male, it takes a lot more for them to see you as female later."

At this point I was only presenting as male at my regular job, and close to full time there. I agreed to do it, on the condition it was the last time it would ever happen. Problem was, the customer I worked with all night, kept referring to me with female pronouns and no matter how much I tried to butch it up, I was female to them.  That was the tipping point for me."

It was easy to tell when it changed though because in boy mode I'd get told I was going into the wrong bathroom, new co-workers would assume I was female even sometimes when I talked in a deep voice, and people would have goofy reactions to me after I spoke. Like I went into a Subway with my girlfriend and once I ordered a few guys in the back started laughing and said something like, ""holy shit that's a dude!"" When my presentation was more feminine I just stopped getting misgendered except when I talked, and with some voice practice stopped getting misgendered at all.

There isn't a magical point from my point of view more s graceful slide of amount of interactions where generally when we get gendered right after a while we don't notice because we're expecting it, but when we get gendered wrong it sticks with us and we really notice. So keep that in mind, our own brains trick us :)  People you know and see regularly us more complicated, they have history, assumptions and change blindness on their side so chances are it'll take a while before they look and go ""oh you've changed a bunch"".

The effect on me was telling. I was scared of it, but I knew I had to transition. I told him I had to, and we broke up. He researched tons and looked at timelines, but the end result was something he couldn't handle. And I respected that.   We only have one life to live, and I still have a long time to live.

I came out to her and within a few days she decided to move back in with her parents and file for divorce. She had been given the advice (by whom I don't know) that if she did not want to be a lesbian then no compromise would be possible. Basically, she decided if we stayed together and I transitioned she would resent me and if I did not I would come to resent her. The breakup was extremely swift and extremely painful but I understand why she did it. She did not want to see the person she fell in love with and had made plans to have a family with turn into someone else.   During transition I encountered the attitude from some of my family that the old me would die and be replaced by a new me, like transition was the same as being a stepford wife. They have since realized I am the same person I always was. For my ex however, my gender was an integral part of how she saw and related to me, and to her own identity. So while my family doesn't see me as a different person I could never be her husband again.  Looking back it's hard not be angry, but I understand that by leaving and cutting things off early she was just protecting herself (and me) from what she saw as a long painful inevitability."
asktransgender,3dp6c1,AprilRyan8,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:51:39 2015 UTC,"If this is something that is causing you distress you will lose the relationship over it one way or another. Stress in your life will affect the life of your partner.  But first, before you do anything drastic - see if you can get your partner to a support group for non-transitioning partners/spouses. And I would advise heavily considering couples counseling with a trans-friendly therapist. These measures might give them more insight into what is happen with your dysphoria and will give them a good place to go for support because your partner is probably scared as hell right now and feeling very isolated.  /r/mypartneristrans has lots of good advice as well - these guys all went through watching their partners transition. Some people make it, many do not.  I personally broke up with my partner for non-transition related issues, but my biggest source of fear and misery regarding this was them. I wanted so badly to make them happy, to not lose them - I was almost willing to try and short circuit my transition so I would have a masculine face and a female body. Not what I want, but at first it was all they were willing to let me have.  Transitioning has got to be all about you. If it is not you will not be able to make the changes that will ease your dysphoria, and if you can't ease your dysphoria then what is the point?  Stay strong, and remember that you deserve to be happy - 6 years with someone or not. Misery poisons relationships, this is no exception."

It's not fun to have to ponder divorce while going through your transition related medical care if it comes to that.  I ended a five year relationship where I was open about being trans the whole time. When I was 20, I started T and he said he couldn't handle the changes. He begged me to stop. He cried. He stayed in bed for weeks on end.  I left so that he wouldn't depression himself to death. It sucked. I no longer had a home or anyone to buy me food, so where all of my job earnings were going toward university tuition, they had to start going to rent and food. I dropped out of school and started working in my career (turned internship into regular job).  And then a few months later, he started hanging out with me again. And this person who went to every class with me and ate every meal with me and slept next to me every night for years was in my life again. And now he's my best friend. And he calls me every day. And cares about how I'm doing and even supports my transition.  And I got to be with someone who liked seeing my body get more and more ""properly male"" (if there is such a thing!). And he makes me feel good. And so I have my lover and my former lover in my life and everything is great.  And even if my changes had to be the death of that relationship forever, it was something I needed to do. The only other option would have been suicide. There were no mental gymnastics I could do to convince myself that life with the wrong hormones was okay. Hell, even going off T voluntarily to have a baby was a horrifyingly nightmarish experience! I can't be a good friend, lover, or parent without my medical needs being taken care of. I can't be me.  Anyway. Don't marry that guy until you're sure of yourself--whatever you decide.

I'm gay. I do not get aroused by going to bed with women! It does not work. But...  My relationship with my partner is so much more than sexual gratification. What about loyalty and commitment and companionship? What about love? People of all stripes go through huge changes over the course of their relationships--aging, disability... I'm not going to sit here and argue against the merits of a good break-up, but since when are our intimate relationships not worth fighting for? It's one thing when a person tries and they're not strong enough to handle it and end up leaving, but I don't think people get a free ""get out of relationship"" card when a partner comes out as trans. I don't understand why that is the social default.  And I am someone who thinks sex is important! I already need sex five times a day and it's a challenge getting one time daily out of my husband. But if something happened where my partner didn't want sex with me or if they did but I had do perform in a different way due to changes in my reaction to them, I would do it! Because the whooooooooooooooooole rest of my relationship is worth that--easily."

I've been with my girlfriend for a few years now and we plan on getting married, but I doubt that's going to last once I tell her I'm trans and plan on transitioning. It's depressing and sucks and I hate thinking about telling her and our relationship ending, but the reality is if someone doesn't love you for who you are then the relationship has run its course. The best thing you can do is weigh out what's more important to you, being happy with your partner, or being happy with yourself. Some people sure, they can be happy suppressing themselves because of the way their relationship makes them feel. Me personally, I've denied myself happiness for too long. No relationship is worth being unhappy with myself"

I think it was because I could still see the old me in the mirror all of the time. It got tiring to put all that on, so I slowly cut back on the amount. First to go was the foundation and blush, then the eye make up, particularly after I had to start wearing glasses all the time. These days I still wear lipstick most of the time, I'd say about 90% of the time I go out. I can go without it, but I like the colour I have, so it's kind of become part of my identity.

It was like a switch had been flicked, and I was no longer playing a role, I was just relaxed and being me. When I went full time, I put up some new mental walls, as I felt ashamed that I was ""pretending"" to be female. While I was was a nice looking car on the outside, under the hood was a lawn mower motor. I'd have to say that the real life test was more frustrating that presenting as male. I just wanted to move on with my life as me. After surgery, I felt like me again. No one could question who I was, so I felt free to be me. It was a very refreshing moment.

In all honesty, as close of a friend as they are, if they don't accept you for who you are then they aren't a true friend to begin with. When I first started figuring myself out I dreaded telling anyone out of fear of losing friends. At this point I've told about 6 people, but at first it was scary. First person I told was one of my two best friends, and the other a week later. We were drunk and alone and I wanted to tell her so badly and my brain lit up when an opportunity in the conversation came up to kinda smoothy bring it up. She was really supportive of it, actually happy about it because it meant I was finding myself. That's the reaction a real friend should give. Support and care and happiness for your finding yourself. Each person I've told has made me more and more comfortable with it. I still haven't told my girlfriend or family, but point is I'm prepared at this point to lose friends, no matter how close we are. If they don't accept you they aren't a real friend.

Female TO male (FTM) would be from a typically ""female"" body to a more ""male"" one, versus the other way around.   Also, as someone who IS FTM and a gamer, I'd LOVE a subplot revolving around that. There is NOT enough representation for trans men. I've had people literally be like, ""Oh, I only thought men could become women, not the other way around,"" so it would show things to people on a wider scale that they may not have known were possible.   You could always go somewhere in between the two options. Have a character that, if you just go through the main quest, it doesn't mention them being trans much. But if you dig into their backstory (meet people they know, find collectibles, take alternate story paths, etc), it goes more into detail about how they coped, how they felt, how they deal with being transgender.   Don't worry about writing things just because you aren't that thing. So what? Diversity is good. You may not be perfect, and that's okay - imperfect representation is better than none. If people only wrote about or made characters based on who they were or what they had experienced, this world would be very, very boring.   Also, feel free to ask any questions you may have about pre-op FTMness. I can only answer from my own POV as a poor Hispanic pre-op FTM dude, obviously, but I won't be offended by anything you ask. Either here or via PM if you'd rather.

Its a valid approach, since thats what most trans folks aspire to in the end, but I wouldn't mind seeing an early presenting character.  It still doesn't and probably shouldn't focus entirely on trans as the character's identity, but an aspect. Maybe your FTM is not allowed into a bar with his companions because he looks too young, or he won't go to a bath house or go swimming.  I do think he should encounter some resistance and bigotry since thats how it is and its kind of uncanny to skirt around it and pretend it doesn't exist, but there was a somewhat recent fuss about enemies in Witcher III calling Ciri a bitch, I think people might be too sensitive to realism."

It would definitely be a safer approach to take, but I don't know if I'd be selling the issue short by going that way? The way the story is at the moment, it's very much focused on a grander goal of saving the world (typical fantasy style), so any issues of transitioning would be included as subplot (although potentially a pretty prominent subplot at certain points in the game). I might focus less on that and more on some other struggle though, and just have the fact that they're trans come to the fore when romance is introduced or when they come across someone that's especially bigoted."

If so could that change the individual permanently or as I believe is alluded to in gw2 can only alter the perception of the individual (the npc in gw2 that has transitioned is I believe a mesmer which is basically a mental magic / illusions based caster).  Or would the individual have access to medical care like hormones or potions to help... or are they stuck with their body but trying to pass as male using other methods?    If it was illusion based it'd be worth thinking about what happens if they are effected by antimagical methods or if they were knocked out, maybe that could be their involuntary outting as a story line starter?

My initial thought was that they would be trying to pass as male with short hair and chest binding, but would be on the lookout for a powerful magical item/spell that could fully change their body from female to male. Potions or illusions are an interesting notion, though. Something that temporarily turned you from female to male, but wears off under certain circumstances.

asktransgender,3dmtog,static_anonymity_,3,Tue Jul 21 07:59:47 2015 UTC,"I do not see you succeeding very well for various reasons, but if you want to go for it. There is a lot things you will need to consider as being transgender in fantasy setting, while not making that their whole identity and making it fun to play will be huge challenge.  Here is some points.   Why would they choose to play with this character particularly?   I think, you should make the character interesting on its own and have the story line which dwells deeper in him being trans, be rather optional path to choose later on.    Otherwise you are just giving a trans character for sake of it. Not an interesting character who happens to be dealing with being transgender, which should be the focus in my opinion.   How are you going to work him being transgender in fantasy setting?   Are you going involve magic, herbs, drugs? How about surgeries? How do you deal with possible depression? These are important question, if you want to flesh out your character and world to be coherent.   What about personality?   You will need to build personality and then make them act coherently to the issues he faces, were the issues trans related or not.   You will hear people tell their experience and methods, but you will have to create a character, who works/solves those problems/issues within his own personality and tools.  I hope I could help a bit. Obviously FtM experiences for a detailed character you should ask from a FtM person."
asktransgender,3dmtog,static_anonymity_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:13:33 2015 UTC,"I am so, so aware that I may not (and even probably won't) succeed, but it's something that I'd really like to try. If it doesn't work out, then it won't go forward, because this is the kind of thing that I either want to do right or not at all. Thanks for the feedback, it's been very helpful."
asktransgender,3dmtog,samwisery,3,Tue Jul 21 08:02:39 2015 UTC,"Well, people are still people regardless of gender and they'll always have goals and traits outside of what their gender happens to be.  Having a character who just happens to be trans and having that aspect be irrelevant to their goals seems fine (trans people are still people), but you might as well write a cis character at that point. Portraying trans people as just your ordinary everyday person who happens to be trans (and thereby helping to 'normalise' us in the eyes of society) is a perfectly legitimate method of going around this, but I feel like I'd want more.  I guess I just want more representation of the issues trans people face because the above method doesn't really do much to educate people on the trials a lot of transgender people face. Good representation of any minority should be more than  just showing acceptance of diversity, but also demonstrate more than surface-level (or at least not inaccurate) knowledgeability on the aspects that make up that minority. Otherwise it may just come off as feeling like a shallow and thoughtless addition, thrown in as diversity for diversity's sake. (The Disneyland version :P)  This is why I'd like to see the subplot address things like transitioning issues. While the general public may have a basic knowledge of what trans people might face, it's often very distant to them. Like reading about a war in a history textbook versus reading the diary of a trans person which would add in a more human element. (Also more interesting! I remember something about another FtM guy posting about his packer slipping and then stepping on his dick, which is hilarious AND educational about some everyday transguy life. XD)  At the same time, I feel like having having any character's story revolve around a single issue is boring. Down with one dimensional characters! Multiple motivations and character traits! Less of that writing-only-what-you-know even if it's scary!  A way of doing more of 'show, don't tell' method of storytelling might be to have the character constantly misgendered - perhaps maliciously or well intentionedly by people who are aware that character is trans. I'm going to do a copypasta of a gaming anecdote I had regarding a character I made in Skyrim:   I'm FtM but lean towards the androgynous side, so the hypersexualised models of the stereotypical game characters with bodybuilder-like male characters and the top-heavy-and-tiny-waist female characters were BOTH 'not me' … Thing was, I wanted to make an androgynous guy character but I simply couldn't make the male model androgynous enough for my liking. (I wanted a Nord, dammit, even if the elven models might have worked better!) So I simply chose the female model and tried to make it as masculine looking as possible.  I loved that character, but suddenly I realised something: Even though he was clearly male in my head, NPCs were addressing my character as female. Which felt very, very disconcerting and wrong.  So I just joined the Dark Brotherhood and murdered everyone and then no one wanted to come up and say hi and thus potentially misgender him! :D   My character looked like a perfectly ordinary guy (thank you, gender neutral armour I modded in!) so it was downright weird feeling the disconnection, of having my view of him so clearly at conflict at the NPCs' views. He might as well have had a beard, not like the game logic would recognise him as a man. I had basically unintentionally made a trans character.  It was seeing that disconnection that made me realise I was a transguy myself. I realised that that I felt male, that what I thought of myself was different from what the world thought I was, and that I would be much more comfortable being recognised as a man.  Hope this was helpful. As a FtM guy who loves gaming, having people interested in writing trans characters makes me really, really happy."
asktransgender,3dmtog,artgeekwithglasses,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:49:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for such a comprehensive answer! The ""Disney Version"" is definitely something I'd like to avoid. I guess the difficulty is getting the balance between them being a character that accurately represents what trans people can go through while cis gamers with no interest in trans issues will still feel like they can relate to them and will still find them appealing to play. My first iteration of the character utterly failed because that balance was way off, so now I'm just trying to find that sweet spot in between the two."

I think it's about negotiating that space. To some people, the word is more than a word - it's personal.

If you don't want to stick with needles, there's gel that you put on everyday. Also yes to the muscle mass and easier to lose fat.   Most people feel a lot better psychologically, having a clearer mind. There's also thinking more... logically? Like not ruled by emotions. Of course this doesn't happen with everyone, and if you have preexisting conditions, they'll still be there. It's not an absolute cure took depression our anxiety.  Edit. Three years estrogen blockers? That's really uh, not very common among ftm. Sure there's some, but only for about a year. Basically it's putting them into menopause, hot flashes, lethargy, things like that. Most don't go on e blockers cause most feminization is done with by the time 14 rolls around since girls hit puberty earlier. It'll make some feel a bit better, and just basically stop periods. And maybe the face from becoming more girlier."
asktransgender,3dp42h,TheFlyingSpork,3,Sat Jul 18 03:01:21 2015 UTC,"I assumed the hormone blocking treatment was to prevent female puberty, since the character is a teen. 3 years of it would mean he started blockers at around 13, which makes a lot of sense."

Since he's been on T, I can count on maybe one and a half hands how many times he's cried. He still has feelings, he just doesn't cry about them as much.

asktransgender,3dp42h,TheFlyingSpork,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:20:59 2015 UTC,"Okay. I was going by the source I linked to, which said:  ""They therefore feel confident enough to provide hormone blockers just after the start of puberty in carefully selected cases, but only with the fully informed consent of the adolescent and the parents or guardians.... By this early stage of puberty, before the young person has developed unwanted secondary sex characteristics, he or she has, nonetheless, been able to experience the initial  effects of naturally produced hormones. This is regarded as diagnostically important. This intervention provides the adolescent, and the clinicians, with an extended, additional period of time to examine thoroughly his or her own sense of gender identity whilst being spared the stress of full puberty. Improved psychological and social function is reported in young people helped in this way.""  I think this particular mistake was based on not noticing that detail of ""when puberty begins"". Due to that, I probably ended-up getting the treatment timeline screwed-up. The three years thing and the starting of sending cross-sex hormones came from this excerpt:  Following a substantial period – up to two or even three years of reversible intervention, adolescents who are confirmed as transsexual, may then be prescribed cross-sex hormones (testosterone for a trans boy; estrogen for a trans girl) This third phase of treatment produces changes which are only partially reversible, and is not usually undertaken before the  age of 16.""  This why I asked. I think this particular medical source was focusing on transgender females rather than transgender males since I thought it was odd to start it around the time that female puberty usually ends. Thank you. Given that and the realization that three-years is way too long, I think that I am probably going to have to reevaluate the treatment timeline. What do you think would be a better timeline of treatments?"
asktransgender,3dp42h,YoungFolks,3,Sat Jul 18 13:28:34 2015 UTC,"The /r/ftm FAQ wiki and ftmguide.org both have really good, detailed info on hormones and everything else FTM related.   Some difficulties might be muscle aches and increased appetite as your body grows. Downstairs growth is one of the first changes, and there might be chafing or sensitivity issues.   Psychologically, it can be a whirlwind. Some people experience some negative affect while the body readjusts to new levels. Some people might experience moodiness or irritablility. I was quicker to anger for almost half a year after starting. It was like the threshold for what annoyed me lowered. But, in my case, I had my adult experiences and self-control, so it wasn't like I was lashing out at everybody like a rage monster.  As for how to address that this character is trans...Does he have POV sections? You can work in him thinking about starting T, or thinking about doing his shot, or doing something trans related. Maybe he's getting ready in the morning and mention him binding or adjusting his packer (if he has one). Or him being excited or annoyed by the changes coming from T (increase in acne is another common effect, very annoying.)   The reader can become aware that he is trans, without the other characters having to know, and it would be more in line with the character's personality. And it would be easier to make it just a part of the character's background, rather than tokenizing it."
asktransgender,3dp42h,dontmindmyboobs,3,Sat Jul 18 06:15:36 2015 UTC,Don't assume 'depressive and anxiety disorders' come from unsupportive circumstances. Dysphoria is a beast in its own right.
asktransgender,3dp42h,mygqaccount,2,Sat Jul 18 09:34:05 2015 UTC,"Injections would usually be about 0.5cc's once a week. Testosterone will only benefit physical activity: they'll gain muscle easier, lose weight faster, etc. If they miss a dose it will fuck up their emotions and energy, which could possibly affect physical activites.  As to psychological changes, I'll leave that to the Trans men to answer. Everything else I said was just general knowledge."
asktransgender,3dp42h,AlexaviortheBravier,2,Sat Jul 18 02:50:36 2015 UTC,"These are hard questions to answer.  How often injections happen varies. Some people are on weekly, every two weeks, three weeks, sometimes more depending. What country the character is in matter too since what is prescribed varies.   Weekly is often preferred to avoid the ""lows"" between injection where a person feel lethargic, depressed, dysphoric. But that also involves more injecting. I think most young trans men start on a lower does and every two weeks. (You didn't say the guy's age though or I missed it and am on mobile so I can't check.)  What else, the emotional affects when starting. I can't remember exactly. I know my anxiety was up. You also can get headaches and it is important to up your water intake because you need more and it affects your blood cell count and blood pressure. I also felt tired in the beginning especially the day after the shot for the first few. I also had some hot flashes as my body switched hormone systems. They weren't intense but I'd suddenly flush and feel warm. I was also more emotional in the beginning. First period after T had some killer PMS which usually doesn't bug me much but you kind of go through a mini menopause in the beginning.  Things level out more to what is ""traditionally"" thought of for HRT once that period is over. I think for me it lasted about a month? It is really emotional. It is your first really big step and it takes some time to get there so you are excited but also feeling impatient. You had a date to look forward to (the start of T) and now you just have to wait for the changes and who knows when you'll get them or how they'll show up. So it can also be a bit depressing to start. Like the day after vacation when the next one is months away.   As for bringing it up, advice would really depend on the character. Do people think he is a man? I mean is he outing himself as trans to be seen as his gender or outing himself as trans so people know what he's going through/where he came from/to support someone else? Like what is the context of him coming out?  I can't really speak about the active thing as I am not but T definitely helps you get more done. When I started T I did 10 push ups for a few weeks in a row and they weren't easy. A month or so after not doing anything since thing I decided to do some push ups and did 20 easy. Never done so easy and I did not work up to it. I also feel a bit more like working out because I feel a bit more physical."
asktransgender,3dp42h,AlexaviortheBravier,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:27:05 2015 UTC,"In this case, I'd say that he is passing. I think that the outing would be of explaining reasoning for actions that would otherwise be difficult to swallow. I imagine that he is going to end-up explaining to his the team members about it as an insecurity that is leading him to take extreme action to avoid capture. My idea is that he displays an uncharacteristic ruthlessness in avoiding capture by faction because it is ideologically hostile to gender-transgressing people. This comes to a head when the team is cornered and he seemingly abandons them. After that mess is sorted-out and they meet-up with him again, they want an explanation. He ends-up explaining that he had far more to lose by being captured by these factions than all but one of his other team-mates, and thus had to abandon them in order to avoid unconscionable fates (while still putting in the effort to rescue his team-mates, particularly the one other team-mate who was at risk to similar fates due to religious reasons)."

asktransgender,3dplzj,misscharlotteG,2,Sat Jul 18 05:41:15 2015 UTC,"IPL is known to be less painful, but also less effective. So far, I've had traditional laser done on my face/neck and my chest/belly. The first treatment on the face was somewhat painful, but manageable. The second time around, it was a lot less so.  The first (and so far only) treatment on my chest/belly wasn't very painful at all (I didn't even feel it in some places), except around my rib cage.  As for the timing with either IPL or traditional laser, the hairs  generally take 1-2 weeks to fall out, so you won't really notice any hair loss until then. The ""slower growth"" you're seeing is probably just those hairs working themselves loose to fall out.  I don't know where you are in Australia, but definitely shop around for deals. I found a place in Brisbane that charged me about $40 (that's half off for being the first treatment, so normal price is $80) for my first facial treatment.  I'm travelling around a bit, and I'm in Melbourne now. The place I found here did my face for about the same, and my chest/belly for about $130 (also half off)."

asktransgender,3doqhi,Xynno,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:13:20 2015 UTC,"Modal voice -- your normal speaking voice -- provides the most power as I understand it. Aside from being less breathy, it also contains a richer set of overtones than the other alternatives, creaky voice, breathy voice and falsetto, which only use portions of the vocal folds. My hunch is that the extra information makes it easier for listeners to identify sounds and that in a way also contributes to 'power'.   OK, yeah, I would like to move on to practical advice, but I'm not sure I have any other than the generic: Work on resonance in your modal voice and use creaky/breathy/falsetto for emphasis.  (Disclaimer: I did some phonetics research years back during grad school, but I've forgotten most of it.

asktransgender,3dox99,TransHealthEd,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:04:43 2015 UTC,"MTF here. When my partner and I met I was presenting as gender queer but that was causing family conflict. I went back in the closet for a couple of years, then we moved about 800 miles away. He knew I was struggling with my identity, but when I finally told him how deeply suicidal I was it got his attention. He was invested in us being a gay couple - it is an important part of his identity. He was unsure of being in relationship with a woman, even a transwoman.   I worked on my issues for a year, and then in consultation with him started HRT. He was reluctant at first, but has become fully supportive of me.   We both agreed that the relationship is important and we want to be together. We both are committed to talking and supporting each other. I understand his insecurities and fears and am very, very patient. While I am moving toward happy, I try to remember that he needs time to mourn the things he is losing and to see the changes are not threatening.   We've also agreed to some limits. For example, he really does not want me to have GRS. At my age, and due to cost, that was something I was not focused on. I do, however, NEED to get rid of the testicles. I hate them with a passion. At first that bothered him, but a year in he is now fully supportive and that is in the plans. In other words, we compromised and are patient and talk and work together.   Mostly remember - your gain represents loss to your partner, so allow her space to mourn and be angry and adjust. Don't expect her to be happy-happy-happy because you are."

asktransgender,3dmqf5,in_a_place,5,Fri Jul 17 15:04:28 2015 UTC,"This is complicated as references and background/credit checks are two different things. You would probably have to call up your old employers/references and let them know you have a legal name change and to update their records accordingly. Businesses are pretty much only allowed to give a ""Yes this person worked here, and from xdate to ydate""   As far as background and credit checks, your old name will show up. I've heard of some people getting it off and others not being able too. I think it depends on which credit company you talk too, though I haven't looked to far in to this. Basically shows up as ""Formerly known as/Previous name: qccis"". You can always buy your credit check from the three companies to see what they say.  Ideally your company has an HR dept. and it isn't shitty. or you don't work in HR. Unfortunately, I really don't know if HR is legally bound to not disclose information.    It sucks.   edit: You're legally allowed one free credit check per company per year. So if you're really interested in what they say you can just go ahead and get them now.

Say there's someone with a social security number just one digit different from yours. They default on a car loan. Someone at the bank has a fat finger and enters your SSN by mistake. Suddenly their name and your name become commingled in the system, and their name might show up on your credit report as ""possible aliases.""   Now, if this is a false negative mark, it's worth it to go through the arduous process of getting it removed. But if it's something completely benign, it's probably not even worth the effort.   If you want to go stealth with employers, this is one way to do it. The background checks often don't even show former names, all they often get is a letter back saying, ""all clean. No criminal records found."" But if they do, you can always just laugh it off and say, ""hmm, that's weird. Guess my credit record is a little screwed up."""

asktransgender,3dmqf5,danthetransman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:27:56 2015 UTC,"I've had two jobs since I transitioned, both office jobs at mid-to-large companies. And in both cases I've been stealth in day-to-day office work but quietly out to HR and the occasional close coworker.  (Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer)  Personal info like legal ID and such are only seen by HR; it would be wildly unethical for them to share that info with your coworkers.  Background checks are typically conducted by an outside firm, and evaluated against criteria decided by the hiring company. Oftentimes the only info they share with the company is whether or not you meet the criteria (e.g. you don't have any felonies or outstanding warrants). Many companies don't want to know details about you background that aren't relevant to the job because they could be held liable for it in  a class action or other lawsuit.  As for professional references, once I had 1 job post-transition, I just used references from that job for the next. It helped that it had high turnover and I could get references from coworkers who had already left."
asktransgender,3dmqf5,LovelyShadesOfGray,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:29:51 2015 UTC,"My experience is I tried contacting experian and talked to a guy about trying to remove my previous name from showing up at all on my credit, he said it was possible and I needed to open up a case with them online and upload proof of my name change and ID's and stuff, I did all that, I got no actual email or phone response and they just sent me an envelope saying that they couldn't find anything under my new name and to contact my creditors.   Ideally if you work for a company with an HR department you can disclose a previous name and they wont disclose it to the people you work with, some companies work like that, but especially if it's a smaller company or they don't have an HR department it can be difficult, you just never know if they are going to talk to others about it or not. Sometimes you can even communicate with the company doing the background check and only disclose the previous name to them and it'll never come up. I don't really know what to do at this point other than wait a significant amount of time to where my previous records are no longer relevant, but if someone has had more success in doing this I'd love to hear about it too.  At my last job no one ever said anything about me being trans despite me telling HR before they did the background check and having a male gender marker on my driver's license, but I have no idea if that was just how they decided to treat the situation or if HR didn't disclose that I was trans to management."

asktransgender,3dorx2,GAKBAG,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:59:18 2015 UTC,"Well, my story isn't too far into the future, so circumstances would be reflective of what's current. The story focuses mainly on an ex-journalist who sets out on a long road to find a rumored city that is supposedly still prospering after ""the event"" that fucked the world over. Along the way, he rummages through some things someone left behind and starts hearing someone singing. He traces the voice to this raggedy old doll that's been rigged with the innards of a walkie-walkie, and begins a dialog with her, Prudence, who supposedly lives in this city. Part of the story will go into her experience of how she's been sort of ""rationing"" her HRT since finding any is difficult, and buying it is extremely expensive. Ultimately, though, it's a secret she keeps from Leland for most of his journey. As he gets closer, she starts to have more anxiety and things start getting a bit rocky between them. They develop a very strong long-distance bond, and she's afraid he won't like/love her if he knew. So, this first book (which I intend to be part of a trilogy) focuses on this strange affair between them leading up to a major cliffhanger."

asktransgender,3dno2b,tanuki_chau,2,Fri Jul 17 21:44:57 2015 UTC,Hmm that is a bit easier. You will need to show proof of citizenship and your MS Birth Certificate when you submit for the court order. However you won't be able to amend your birth certificate yet. I believe MS requires SRS in order to amend it. However I need to verify that so consider that info suspect until I edit it. To be honest your best option might be to contact where you submit the paperwork and just ask. Anything involving the U.S. I'd say call the U.S. Consulate.   Edit: and of course MS health website is down.
asktransgender,3dno2b,riijen,2,Fri Jul 17 21:52:31 2015 UTC,"Vital Stats BC recommends updating your birth certificate if possible before trying to update your BC/Canadian documentation, if possible.  I don't know what the requirements for Mississippi are though.  I'm in a similar boat to you (living in the Lower Mainland, born outside of Canada, though I am a citizen) and I have to say it is confusing.  You cannot change your gender marker to anything outside of the M/F binary unfortunately from what I can tell.  Here is the information on how to change your name in BC: http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/vital-statistics/legal-changes-of-name/legal-change-of-name-application  After that you would need to take that to ICBC, your bank, etc.  As for gender marker changes for people born outside of BC, it is a little confusing.  I would call Vital Stats (their toll-free number is 1-888-876-1633) to be sure.  I was able to find this form with instructions (http://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/forms/vital-statistics/vsa509a_fill.pdf).  It seems to be for birth certificates issued in BC, but I think if you submit it they'll give you an official form that you can use to update your driver's license and stuff.  Once again, call them to be sure.  I know someone (born in BC) who changed both their name and gender marker, it was about a 2 month wait.  After that you'll need to get other ID reissued which will take more time, but I can't see the whole process taking more than 4 months (of course there are exceptions).  My recommendation would be to update your birth certificate first (if you can).  After that, you should be able to take all your new documentation in and have your driver's license and such updated."

There really are two things going on: the desire to transition, and what could well be cognitive dissonance, or at the very least rather contradictory feelings about the possible outcomes.  I know where I want to be, but I can't find a way of getting there that doesn't involve a great deal of pain, hurt and betrayal for my wife and possibly my child.

All I can say to your question is that my head must be made of some incredible stuff because I feel like explosions are going off in there on a near constant basis!  I've only known about my feelings for about 2 months too.  I am fortunate to be in a situation where my family is largely supportive and is offering to help myself with feminization.  The problem is, they're really busy so it's going to be very slow, so what was going to be my route to cope with all of this may not be enough after all.  Under your circumstances, what's most important is that you are able to function.  If it gets to a point where you are struggling at your job because of this, try to explore some feminine things and see if they relieve you any.  If so, what you may end up realizing is that transition is inevitable, because there's no way you'll be able to continue on with your life as normal with all of these feelings nagging you for attention.  At some point it'll just give."

You are incredibly fortunate to have such a supportive family, as mine most certainly isn't. I do have a good friend that I can talk to. They found out almost by accident, in that they made a joke about me changing my entire wardrobe and I told them that their joke wasn't far from the truth. We don't talk about it much, but when we do they are very, very supportive and non-judgemental.  I think I will take your advice to try some feminine things. I have in the past, but the closest that I get to it these days is little more than letting my nails grow and looking after them. I just worry that my wife would probably leave me if I did anything more than that, or if I even broached the topic.  I may be underestimating her capacity to accept me as I am, but today when the topic of transgender came up quite by coincidence, she was very bitter and angry about the fact that no one thinks of the families left behind and that people shouldn't lie about who they are before they enter a relationship. I don't see that ending well.  I need to find the strength, psychologically, to do what I need to do, to do what is best. I just feel stupid for coming to this realization so late in life.

This doesn't serve you well either because you only just found out about this.  There's no way you could've told her prior to marrying her because you didn't know.  Hopefully for your sake she finds a way to understand your predicament.  An abrupt death in the family is likely to cause a lot of strain on the family as well, or someone diagnosed with cancer, or someone who suffered severe brain damage and can no longer live on their own, or a parent suffering from dementia (I actually know somebody going through exactly this atm and it's tough on her family).  All of these are things outside of our control, but give family tremendous difficulty.  Just like the fact that we get hungry, or need to pee, etc. so too do transgender people need to deal with their feelings.  You obviously want to keep your family intact, as does your wife.  Hopefully you both can realize this together and find a way to make it work.  I hope it works out for you!  Good luck!  :)"
asktransgender,3dod5p,tulips_onthe_summit,2,Sat Jul 18 21:56:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks again.  What you said about me only just finding out about this got me thinking, because although I knew,  I was very much in denial. I only came to terms with it a couple of years ago and even that was only because the dysphoria (plus an unhealthy dose of shame and guilt) drove me to my GP.  I went to university in the eighties, when it was acceptable for men to dabble a bit with make up and such, thanks to bands such as The Cure. I would take it a bit further and go for rather girlie make up rather than the gothic look that was acceptable, and I would occasional wear female things (looking back, I have fond memories of one particular lilac colored top) but I was horrified at the thought that I might be transgender (if I even knew the word at the time) and would just rationalise it all away. In more unguarded moments when I was alone with my thoughts, I would wish I was a woman, but I would very quickly put those thoughts away in a mental box and try not to think them because they made me feel ashamed and guilty. Then I left university, got a job and threw myself into work.  So, I knew. I just couldn't face knowing. It's a lot more complicated and nuanced than my wife is prepared to accept. As far as she is concerned, I lied.  I will find a way. Thank you again. Talking about this really helps."

I lost count of the posts referring to ""biological gender"" or ""chromosomal gender"" when none of them had any clue what the fuck they were talking about.    That and people saying teenage trans people should only use the bathroom/locker room of their identified gender if they've had surgery, when of course they can't even get surgery till 18. Let alone the fact that plenty of trans people don't want or can't afford surgery. Yeah let's put them in the same room as 20+ other people as their assigned gender and everything will be fine. Unless you have a good mask to fake/act as your assigned gender, those kids are probably going to relentlessly torture the poor trans kid. Well at least that's what they did to me till I told the lead kid and his buddies to fuck off or I'd bash his head in with the baseball bat I was holding.

asktransgender,3dozzy,homura_html,5,Sat Jul 18 01:57:46 2015 UTC,"Always see a gender therapist if you are able to.  LGBT people are a minority, virtually all therapists who treat us also treat the general population.  If they don't have LGBT in the title of the place, their office probably looks normal.   Also, will antidepressants really help my depression? I feel as though my depression is just caused by all the testosterone in my brain.   Who knows.  You have nothing to lose by trying and can stop anytime, so try it.  Many trans people use antidepressants and HRT at the same time.  I've used them in the past, it helped a bit."
asktransgender,3dozzy,Isaac_The_Khajiit,2,Sat Jul 18 02:20:00 2015 UTC,"In terms of transitioning, a gender therapist would be better since they can give you a letter recommending HRT. This is definitely the way to go if you are very confident that you are transgender.  My opinion is that a regular therapist might spend a lot of time trying to solve issues that really can't be solved until you take care of the major iceberg (gender identity) in your brain. (Reason for iceberg analogy is that the majoriy of the gender identity issue is in the subconscious. ) Until you get that solved it is like a huge boat anchor dragging your self esteem and emotions down to the bottom, making you feel worse than waste products from a whale. (Sorry for the nautical analogies. )"
asktransgender,3dozzy,throwawayBimbo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:30:25 2015 UTC,"I see. What I find weird, though, is the gender therapist I saw before said that I should probably take care of my depression first before she and I discuss my gender identity any further. Any idea why she would think that?"
asktransgender,3dozzy,momoftrans,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:44:12 2015 UTC,She could be thinking that the depression is the cause of your identity issues instead of the other way around.  Chicken and the egg kind of thinking.
asktransgender,3dozzy,throwawayBimbo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:47:06 2015 UTC,"There is nothing wrong in pursuing the depression and gender issues concurrently. Antidepressants can help to stabilize a mind that is suffering from acute depression and suicidal ideation.  Sometimes a patient will require an adjunct medication, such as a mood stabilizer. It is best if a psychiatrist prescribes the antidepressant and then monitors how you are doing, rather than the therapist. (Since you are under 18, giving you an antidepressant is more complex than an adult.)  The therapists role is talk therapy and giving you a framework to evaluate your emotions and interpret them in a constructive way. Examples would be CBT and DBT. The therapist should be authorized to discuss your case with the psychiatrist.  You may have been hiding part of yourself, i.e. female sexual identity, and been walking around like a spy in a foreign country, striving to not reveal your inner self. It becomes depressing because you feel like your inner self is in a jail cell.  It can zap your motivation. Your depression gets worse because you feel shame due to the homophobia and transphobia of your school friends, parents and society.  One suggestion that might help in the interim is to keep a journal of your daily thoughts and feelings that you are experiencing. Also try to identify things in life that you enjoy as well as the issues that upset you."
asktransgender,3dozzy,illuminess,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:30:51 2015 UTC,"Well, either one would be fine. A general psychotherapist isn't very likely to judge you as that's very uncouth as a practicing therapist. Seeing a gender therapist, though, would be far more beneficial in the long run. I would say to see whoever you can that's quicker. If it's just a general therapist then you can at least get started with them and move on to a specialist later."
asktransgender,3dozzy,Redbirdyellowbird,2,Sat Jul 18 02:17:44 2015 UTC,"Yes to this.   I've seen both.   Started with a psychotherapist ( their the ones with doctorates) and she was great.   Saw a LPC a few years later and he was good; though, not super familiar with gender stuff. He was able to assist and be non-judgmental.   Seeing and LPC who sees LGBT folks and she is quite good. Nice to hear her be able to talk about other trans people she has counseled."
asktransgender,3dozzy,illuminess,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:26:21 2015 UTC,"Antidepressants can help with depression, but I wouldn't recommend them unless your depression is debilitating. They really screw with your brain chemistry and can cause side effects that may not be very therapeutic. I used Lexapro for several months. It basically leveled me out into a neutral zone emotionally. I wasn't depressed anymore, but I also had issues enjoying things the way I used to. I had to stop using it because of that.

Doesn't hurt to ask. My Walgreens has a thing with my local open door clinic and their meds are super cheap. I think it's around $30 for a month's supply.

And figure out what their costs and stuff are. If they say no, you can ask if they know any other PP's nearby that do informed consent, or any other clinics, and they might point you to somewhere. Here's one guy's recent experience with Planned Parenthood.  The informed consent model is basically you saying you are informed about the treatment and give consent to treatment, then being given treatment. It's not just for trans related care, but lots of other medical treatments for lots of different things.   Planned Parenthood don't just do abortion stuff, they do a lot of gender and sex related care. Asking questions is a good thing. You won't sound like an idiot, just someone who doesn't know, and that's not a bad thing. Most places will be happy to answer your questions."

The first one january when traveling to the US. At this point I was pre HRT and haven't done much more than growing my hair.  When I arrived at the CBP counter ( I am European) and handed my passport, the officer looked very closely to find the resemblance to the photo in my passport. And even CBP looks pretty close always I could tell she looked even closer and deeper.   Second travel, to Istanbul, Turkey.  This time I was 6 weeks on HRT, Hair even longer and styeled more in a feminine way and pierced ears.  Everywhere at the Border checkpoints I received confused looks and everyone looked at least twice to make sure it is me. One gave me a knowing nod which was quite nice.   But, I also told myself that it will be even harder the next time. Especially when I don't present as male anymore. So my goal is to get my gender and name changes as soon I go full time in order to have matching documents. I'd rather go just once to huge pile of bureaucracy and paperwork than having always a fuss.   Same when it comes to stuff like credit cards. If someone just doesn't believe thats your card they might going for the police when they thinks its fraud.   Edit: removed some typos."

Sometimes I think to myself I shouldn't transition because I would never look like a girl or feel real but in the end these shouldn't override what you feel.
asktransgender,3dni7w,TransGirlScientist,2,Fri Jul 17 20:39:24 2015 UTC,"I'm usually a lurker on asktg, but something about your post stuck out to me.    In a lot of ways, your experience coming to grips with your gender and my own are very very different.  I was always a tomboy, always ""one of the guys"".  I loathed makeup and dresses.  But this line in your post is something that 3 years ago I would've said myself:   I just wish more than anything that I was born as a boy in the first place, but obviously that's impossible so I'm really frustrated at myself for getting depressed over something I can't change anyways (I'm not using the word 'depressed' lightly by the way, I've had problems with depression even before this but now the gender dysphoria makes it 10x worse. I'm so unhappy with myself from an aesthetic/physical standpoint that it's hard to leave the house and face people sometimes).   While it's true that you can never go back and grow up as a cis male, and I know how badly that sucks, it's important to remember that transition is possible.  Transition is not simple and it's not easy.  It is a difficult journey, but not nearly so difficult as hiding your true self away-- for the rest of your life.  No one deserves to feel this way   I'm so unhappy with myself from an aesthetic/physical standpoint that it's hard to leave the house and face people sometimes   I realized I was trans when I was 16.  I was terrified because being trans would make me gay too.  I was worried that no one would ever love me, and sometimes I still am, but I know that I would rather be alone and be myself than have people love a facade.  Despite everything I just said, this a a very personal matter.  No internet stranger can know you better than you know yourself.  I hope my words were helpful, and if they were, feel free to PM me any time.  If not, I wish you the best all the same."

Sitting; crossed legged or knees together it wont take long to figure out and its often governed by what clothes you wear.  Voice: If your really sure your going to transition start practicing with your voice try raising the pitch and tone for starters then if you can try adding an inflection this  takes a long time to learn. there are resources that might help you around here somewhere.  Mannerisms: Mannerism are a manifestation of self expression and therefor pretty difficult to learn id say impossible because all your doing is exchanging one fake exterior for another.

As I got older and into my mid-twenties my desires to be femme and my sexual urges started to come apart from each other such that I would be dressed around the house without any sexual feelings - it was more of a comfort thing. Long story short I now identity as a trans women. The moral of the story is that many people ""start"" their transition process feeling like it's just a fetish but such feelings can evolve and you should stay open minded. Try keeping your femme clothes on after you masturbate and see how that makes you feel.   There's nothing wrong with being ""only"" a crossdresser and not ever transitioning.

Personally, I've always known that as a little child I was very fascinated by the girls I played with, to the point that I wanted to be them (one part of how I realised I'm trans) and got sad when I saw my boy body in the mirror. The fact that I couldn't be as pretty as the girls made me depressed.   So, as time went on, at some point I discovered masturbation. And with the onset of puberty, I began having sexual feelings and started rationalising my early interest in girls and masturbation as me simply being very horny. I thought I was a pervert. In fact, I've used sexuality as an outlet for dysphoria. That is to say that I sublimated my crossgender desires of wanting to be a girl as a sexual urge of wanting to be with a girl.  Repression and denial can lead to your trans identity manifest in peculiar fashions, such as what seems to be crossdressing fetish.   I would suggest, you bring up the topic with your therapist at some point. Rest assured that you're not alone with this."

This sounds a lot like me, that's actually how I explain it to myself a lot, that the main reason I enjoy the idea of being a woman is because I've never actually been with one in a romantic sense. That's one of the main things I use to tell myself those feelings are not legitimate ones of wanting to be a woman. This is something I've brought up to my therapist but I don't think we discussed it very much, because I think it was difficult for me to speak about for very long.  The idea that I am repressing a lot of these feelings is something that crosses my mind a lot.

It's not really a secret but it's not something I say to people when I introduce myself lol. ""Howdy do, I'm lovepink, am trans""  It's a need to know basis. So in my view, I'm not ""out,"" but I'm also presenting as my preferred gender. To me that should have it's own category, which is stealth. Again, there are varying levels of stealth. Lots of people know I'm trans because they knew me pretransition. But some people live in areas where no one knows. Others are just extremely open about being trans and wear it proudly. I'd say most people probably fall around where I do. Some people know, some people don't. It's not something you talk about all the time."

Not everyone feels like having a penis conflicts with their identity as female and some like myself embrace it. It makes me feel sexy actually.  Personally I have nonexistent genital dysphoria. I positively enjoy my member (with the exception of when I want to wear tight cloths lol). As a lesbian I enjoy using my ""real"" strapon in all its glory and also receiving pleasure there.

You listen when they try to swing doors shut or open doors you did not expect, doors you've never been behind, doors you've never been curious about.

Often, the person is a child that is under the impression it is actually 'one' with the mother. In fact, quite often we can observe that parents want to self-actualise through their child or children and in the process completely forget the child's original needs, that is to say they subjugate the child under their absolute will.   I often observe it in homosexual men who tell me that their mothers expect grandkids, and they simply can't wrap their head around escaping from their mothers' firm grip.  What I'd advise you is to seek out therapy groups that help you get in touch with your Inner Child. You don't necessarily need a child to re-live your own childhood. You can do it on your own.

I'm just an emt, but I believe rogain actively causes hair growth as a ""side effect"" of the initial drug testing. It's now marketed for that purpose.   Finasteride works internally to actively block a primary DHT receptor in your body, and also has a minor anti-androgenic effect. The later makes it useful in HRT and treatment of prostate cancer in high doses, and also leads to gynecomastia in lower doses for cis males.   As long as your body is producing high volumes of natural androgens (i.e. You still have testicles) you'll have to take a dht inhibitor to prevent re losing what you've gained back. Post ori, or post op though you shouldn't have to, as your body will only produce androgens in the brain and adrenal gland, like a cis female."
asktransgender,3dmi5w,Healfwer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:15:52 2015 UTC,This applies even while on spironolactone with almost nonexistent T?
asktransgender,3dmi5w,Michellesagirlsname,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:53:24 2015 UTC,"Non-existent T should have a similar effect. In the absence of T, the body can't produce DHT. No DHT, no effects from DHT.   That said, finasteride specifically blocks DHT. Spiro = better AA, Fin= minor AA (but good enough for some people, like me :D) but direct targeting of MPB."

asktransgender,3dmi5w,nuovo_donna,2,Fri Jul 17 17:54:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, wind is my nemesis. I normally pass pretty well, but I have a hair line that doesn't make a downward turn until past my temples, so it looks very masculine when exposed. Unfortunately it's not something that I can do anything about without surgery since it's just the way my hairline stretched as my head grew during puberty. The rest of my hair is thick and healthy, but I've had those dents in my hairline since my late teens. I hide it easily enough, but a strong gust of wind will sometimes expose me. It happened once in a parking lot as I walked in front of a van full of women and they all burst out laughing at me. It's not the first time it's happened and it never fails to ruin my week."
asktransgender,3dmi5w,gegenny,2,Fri Jul 17 18:31:25 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure T is the worst enemy.  The wind would at best be a conspirator.  As recommended, Finesteride has for almost 20 years been the first line of defense against MPB, however Dutasteride is newer, and more effective if you can get that prescribed and covered.  I don't think there is a generic yet in the US so it would be more expensive but it's worth it."

asktransgender,3dmxyy,PhazonZim,4,Fri Jul 17 16:03:01 2015 UTC,"I recently went to a ServiceOntario location near Toronto for doing my name change and birth certificate gender marker change, and had the fun of talking to someone who kinda knew, but didn't know exactly what's needed (i.e. Normal Government Funtimes).   From what we discussed as I got the commissioner's stamp for the name change form (couldn't get it for the birth certificate gender marker change request form due to name not being done yet), someone else had come in to get their commissioner's stamp and had a form I didn't have yet. There's a form that she saw but had no clue where the person earlier in the day got it from.  Turns out it's a form not found easily anywhere unless you know where to look.  Request for Non-Publication in The Ontario Gazette  I have to thank Christin Scarlett Milloy for her blog about this stuff. The link the government gives in the name change package is a dead link, and trying to call/fax is a waste of time.  I'm not sure of the birth certificate part since I haven't done it yet. I just sent in the name change form for the second time since they denied the first one for some stupid ""not valid guarantor"" thing... It's a stupid strict list, so I'm hoping a family friend police officer who's known me for over 15 years is a good reference.   By the way, I have no clue how it works for someone who hasn't lived in Ontario for more than 2-5 years.  This site seems to tell more about the process from a finished perspective   Prevent Name Change From Publication Ontario Gazette  tldr; (look at averygirlygirl's info, you can send both in at the same time)   Get request form for name change (Ontario Name Change Form) Do name change (commissioner's stamp at ServiceOntario place, send in with Ontario birth certificate (different  if born outside Ontario))  Wait for name change confirmation in 6-8 weeks in mail Looks like you can actually send both in at the same time. (wished they told me this properly at the ServiceOntario office... for fks sake...) Go back to ServiceOntario with birth marker request form and doctor's note/letter to prove status  (commissioner's stamp for form) (Birth Cert Requests) Do driver's license change showing doctor's note/letter (not sure if they take it permanently) Send in birth form (with doctor's letter/note, one which you're okay with giving to them permanently (i.e they don't return it))"
asktransgender,3dmxyy,SarahVeraVicky,2,Fri Jul 17 16:57:43 2015 UTC,"I did this recently.  Do them both at once so that you don't have to pay for the replacement birth certificate twice.  You can submit both requests at once, they have to be mailed in but can be mailed together with a single payment.  There are a number of things to be filled and signed for the name change - the gender change is the easy one!  Make sure you return a complete package, even forms that don't apply like the adult approval for child's name change. Make sure you return the non-publish form or they will ask you for it anyway and delay the processing of it.  Otherwise, very straight forward.  Took about 5 weeks from when I mailed it to when I got the new birth certificate and change of name certificate."

asktransgender,3dmxyy,SarahVeraVicky,2,Fri Jul 17 18:35:00 2015 UTC,"They don't at all make it easy :(  In the end, it saves time by doing it all together (saves 6 weeks or so) and the $37 fee to replace the birth certificate since you already get one with the Name Change.  Since you do them both at once, you change your health card and driver's license using your new birth certificate and name change notice.  Once you have the new license, you use the license and BC to apply for a new passport, SIN, etc.  The hardest part for me was some of the credit cards... Some were good and would take an email with a scan of the documentation. Others demanded to see original documents which was silly - I just cancelled the cards."
asktransgender,3dmfwn,M995,6,Fri Jul 17 13:36:36 2015 UTC,"First things first. Make sure the surgeon is legit. By that make sure the doctor has a medical license and is qualified to perform a surgical procedure.   Standard recovery time is between 4-6 weeks, after which you can lift heavy things and move around and be happy. Before that you are really REALLLY going to want to take it easy for the first week or so. Week two you can walk very short distances and do things like make breakfast or grab the mail. DO NOT LIFT ANYTHING HEAVY! It's basically going to feel like someone kicked you there...and didn't stop.   So my experience sort of sucked lol. I got my orchi from someone who I shouldn't have and ended up having some complications. I got an infection and had to go to the hospital. This is why I said make sure it's a doctor who is qualified for this surgery. Normally it's totally safe and you are in and out. I think with the rise of IC doctors willing to perform this operation, it's really helped raise the bar in terms of safety for the patient. So while mine is a cautionary tail of making sure to check the legitimacy of your surgeon, I will say after the initial hospital stay (infection) I was fine and recovered pretty well from it.   I got one because the AA's were causing me to black out from severe low blood pressure and at the time I didn't have insurance and a lot of the newer AA's didn't really exist or weren't obtainable."

Yes, there is privilege in being a feminine female. However, you might end up trapped in that and hating life if you're not feminine to begin with. And just like male privilege, if you're not male that often becomes its own prison sentence.  I say be you. If someone doesn't like you because you're not feminine, then they don't like the real you anyway and you dodged a bullet.  Being authentic will make your transition easier than anything, because you'll be being genuine with yourself and have confidence from that. So I would say don't conform to standards of femininity to people-please, because that is a bottomless abyss.  If you are femme, or curious and wanting to try to be, go for it."
asktransgender,3dn6qy,Hypatia_the_Wrathful,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:02:56 2015 UTC,"Only have a feminine look if that's what would feel right for you. Gender identity doesn't have to reflect in what clothes you wear.   I think the best way to make it easier for people who are ignorant, but not dismissive, is to explain to them how our biology develops in two phases: the biological and the neurological, and that sometimes the brain develops in the opposite direction making you identify differently than your birth sex. Also, try to have them think back on moments that may have been obvious to your gender issues (i.e. behaviors, interests, hobbies, etc).   If you're not on HRT then mood swings, in my experience, are harder to manage. I noticed how everything seemed to balance out and calm down once I started HRT. I finally feel normal and more in control.   Personal safety, I think, should be intuitive and based on your environment and circumstances. Use discretion.   If getting a feminine look is important to you, then write down some things you like, browse Pinterest for outfit ideas, and talk to some women in your life who might be happy to help you figure it all out. :)"

All hair types are different so you may have to experiment a little and find what works for your hair.   As for cut I'd get the back of your hair trimmed up and maybe get some short layers put in, check out pictures of longer pixie cuts and you may find something that's pretty gender neutral that would look good.

A qualified therapist in both gender dysphoria and ocd would only be able to answer this for you, or rather help you find the answer.  Fwiw, you can have gender dysphoria and other mental health issues. Seeking out a therapist is probably the best thing for you since you said:   I don't recall ever thinking I was female. I don't recall ever wishing I had a woman's body. But since questioning I've been wondering maybe I do want those things, but it's hard to say. When I realised I was gay it was much more clear and certain. This trans thing seems hazy and full of uncertainty, but it's possible I'm in denial.

Being trans... not cool and fun.    Are you trans? Only you can say. Do you think your personality is uncharacteristic of a man's but somewhat typical of a woman's? Do you look in the mirror and wish that you'd look like a woman? Do you feel inadequate to fulfill the role of a man in various circumstances?    I know several autistic trans girls, but only a couple that... how would you put it... that their personalities ""pass""? I've met autistic girls who aren't trans and they're pretty weird and awkward, but completely different vibe to most of the autistic trans girls I've met. I'm beginning to wonder if there are a lot of people out there with autism who think they're trans for some reason but actually their feels are misplaced.

Of the three trans people I know of in real life, one was disowned and forced to move house after his neighbours found out.  Another was disowned and forced to move jobs after her colleagues found out, and the third receives constant abuse online and was physically assaulted recently.  I think the problem is knowing whether the anxiety I'm experiencing is dysphoria or OCD.  I think I do have feminine aspects to my personality, I'm quite gossipy.  But I always thought this was because I lacked the social skills to get to know some people, so I usually tried to get to know them by asking people I knew a little better to tell me about them.  But to be honest I'm not even sure what a female personality is supposed to be, or a what a male role is exactly.  I don't think I've ever dreamed of having a woman's body.

Like I was just talking to her a little while ago, about how I didn't like my eyebrows and wanted to make them less bushy and she basically said that I shouldn't because ""they look perfectly nice right now"" and that I should ""look at models"" because big eyebrows are in right now. Then She was all like ""I never had nice eyebrows when I was your age"""

She has a different understanding of how brains work, partially because in my family both me and my dad have chronic depression, both me and my sister have social anxiety issues, and all three of us have obssevive compulsive tendencies, whereas my mom does not really have any of these. And she is often times the rock in our family that everyone else holds onto. Its just I think, she doesn't realize that this time I'm not trying to hold on to her, but pull her along to where I am."

asktransgender,3dn7fb,badschema,2,Fri Jul 17 17:14:57 2015 UTC,"Avodart, dutasteride becomes in essence worthless past the point your T levels are suppressed. Duta suppresses DHT, which comes from T.  Medroxyprogesterone is not bio-identical projesterone. It's known for all women of all kinds to give some serious mood swings. Prometrium is a bio-identical progesterone, and even in steroidal form since it is not bound to anything to slow it down (pro-hormone.)  Honestly, my opinion is to wait a couple years with just E and let the breasts develop more akin to other women.  Once your T is suppressed it is suppressed mostly, but sometimes people have this weird thing with spiro where in a year or two in it stops working.  Both medroxyP and P are medium strength anti-androgens. Despite P can convert to T after three changes, it is an anti-androgen. MedroxyP can not convert to T.  You'll be fine if you cycle. You'll probably get mood swings like many women who have a cyclical hormone cycle. The benefits are neurological mostly. Despite the moody week, it's calming for me overall, and it prevents estrogen dominance and lets the cells cycle off estrogen a bit and use P instead and I plan to do this for the rest of my life, or until ovaries."
asktransgender,3dn7fb,Hypatia_the_Wrathful,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:21:01 2015 UTC,"OK, and apparently the halflife for medroxyprogesterone is about 30 hours, so... I guess it's more like being on lots of meds toward day 27, and then tapering off the E faster, and the medroxyprogesterone a bit slower.  So I do in fact have T surpression to some degree during those 3-4 days and I probably don't need to be terrified about it.  Thanks. :)"
asktransgender,3dn7fb,Hypatia_the_Wrathful,2,Fri Jul 17 17:43:27 2015 UTC,"Both medorxyP and P are stronger anti-androgens than estrodial, not by much, but they are stronger. Some people get a heavy dose of medroxyP as their sole anti-androgen because they don't have any other options for them.  If you get the typical awful moodiness of medroxyP, then Prometrium is also an option, and honestly the better option in my non-medical opinion. I get the mood swing from hormones going up and down, but once on P and the E has left I'm just calm, on the few days where things are influx is when I'm moody. On medroxyP in the past, oh my."

asktransgender,3dn7fb,Hypatia_the_Wrathful,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:46:10 2015 UTC,"Holy crap that is low. If I'm reading this right. So basically you take 10mg at a start of a four week injection cycle? I bet by the third week your E levels are below 10 pg/mL. So most of your third and fourth weeks you have nothing, and your second week is probably low too.  Have you thought about finding and informed consent clinic near you so you can have control over your hrt? Why not .5mL or 20mg/ bi-weekly then?"
asktransgender,3dn7fb,tanuki_chau,2,Fri Jul 17 18:59:33 2015 UTC,Because my estrogen levels are stupid high and the endo is being dumb. I think my levels at week two was something like 685 I believe.  It's less of a problem because I don't have testes so it doesn't really matter. I do enjoy only having to do a monthly shot though. Fire and forget for 30 or 31 days lol. (Unless it's February) but yeah the endo has been desperate to put me on patches or creams 'for my best interests and safety' because welts and rashes are totally in my best interest lol. (I get severe skin reactions to both) either way it's annoying but I have the benefit of time to plan my next move. It's just more annoying than anything else. On the plus side a vial last for freaking EVER lol.   The IC clinic here primarily caters to lower income individuals and they don't take my insurance. There is also the issue of the 4 month waiting period (well it was four months last time I checked lol) plus they also seemed to have serious issues keeping appointments. As in id show up and magically I don't have an appointment.

I ended up bigger than most.  Now I pride myself in my thinness again. So I like being model thin. I happen to have that body type. Sure I wish I was curvy, but I can't be right now - after I sufficiently eliminate all muscle, I'll go for curvy.  I've been given a lot of hate from the GSM and feminist worlds for my overt femininity, love of traditional gender roles (minus sexism), and my thinness and desire to be model thin. So hate me.

When we're ""stealth"", we're often out for who we really are, and aren't oppressed with society's ignorance. The words we use, or accept from the past, can confine and enslave our thinking. I'm most out when I'm not confined by society's ignorance. I'm female identified first and foremost, and I lead with that in life. My private medical history is private and doesn't belong to the public domain. This isn't a closet: it's living out as me.   Some people feel that pretending to be CIS, is their new closet.   I don't think most people who are not visibly a gender minority, or vocal about it, assume they are in the gender majority. However, we do live as genuine as they do.  Once you've been on HRT a long while, and if you end up with the privilege of blending in, you might come to see the stance of those of us who rather just leave this in the past where it belongs.  We are often the ones who make a big deal of transitions and minority status. For those of us who are binary, straight, don't identify as trans, and are mostly done with transitioning and blending, we are actually living the most genuine we ever have.   If this is the case, I think this is totally wrong. Because this advice, make me feel even more embarrass of what I am.   If you want to go loud and proud, by all means. If you think those of us who don't wear a trans or gender minority flag on our foreheads are feeling shame... I think you're projecting."

No I don't see myself as trans, and especially not identifying as such. You can see me that way, your thoughts are yours.   After decades of dealing with this, and mostly alone, I see myself as a female. I didn't find myself in a trans community. I found myself, and later found the trans sphere. I'm a female who happens to be a gender minority, and I have a medical history around my body, but that's private, like my SSN is private.  If you think going loud and proud is the best thing by all means. If you identify as trans, awesome, rock it with pride. I rock being female with pride. Female without a forced adjective attached to it. I was in the beginning very vocal, but it's not who am and not how I want to live.

I would rather it not be an issue, but I also have a need to put food on my table, and a roof over my head. For now, I'll be staying stealth, where I can make sure of those basic needs. If I was to out myself at work, it would just cause more stress. I transitioned at my previous place of employment, and I can really do without the stress that caused.

This is not some privacy thing, I ask anything I want. If someone says no, I thank them and leave. No one has any implicit right to privacy in the consititution. Do not give me some madeup justification of laws.  Harassment is a consistent, prolonged threat. No one responds to something like someone asking if you were assigned male at birth. Not the cops anyways.  And to be frank, where I live, I can ask people anything and it's perfectly fine, so maybe you come from a different mind set. But I did that where I came from which was also extremely conservative.  You demand that you have privacy when you are guaranteed none. I think that my being open helps people understand. Do what you will. I don't give a care.  Everyone has the right to ask any question they want of anyone however. And that's all I've repetitively said.

asktransgender,3dm9sj,cybelechild,2,Fri Jul 17 12:49:00 2015 UTC,"I think there is a difference between not wanting to be associated with the trans label because of internalized shame and because you feel it is a practical hinderance to how you want to live your life. Most important is to be honest with yourself.  I think it's great when more people are ok being out as trans because it humanized and normalized our identities. For all my ""down with the patriarchy"" commentary, I don't consider myself someone in some fringe minority, and I think the fact that I am pretty normal and boring (yet awesome) and also trans helps destigmatize the label, making it less necessary for others to avoid being identified as such to avoid discrimination. But I don't expect a cookie for it or begrudge anyone their right to arrive at the life they want to be living by any means they find appropriate."
asktransgender,3dm9sj,NonasNonce,2,Fri Jul 17 17:10:13 2015 UTC,"Stealth for me just means not wearing my trans status on my sleeve. I don't advertise that I'm trans. I don't want to be discriminated against at work or put into awkward situations because people know I'm trans if at all possible, my neighbors who don't know me don't need to know I'm trans, the person ringing up my groceries at the store doesn't need to know I'm trans. It's just a matter of comfort, safety, and protecting myself from discrimination. My close friends and family know I'm trans and it will probably stay that way for the most part, I don't ask them to pretend my past didn't happen and I talk to them about personal things like being trans.   Anyway, it's really a personal thing and I don't think it's fair to judge someone's decision to be stealth as wrong. Most of us binary identified people transitioned because we want to live as our identified gender and not everyone wants to be an out loud and proud activist in all of our life and there's nothing wrong with that.   As far as what we are promoting in this community, I don't think that we are promoting embarrassment. I see all kinds of opinions accepted as far as how out people want to be about their trans status, it just so happens that a large portion of us want to be stealth to some degree and I don't think it's as much about embarrassment as it is about taking ownership of our own lives and living how we want to."

Many, many many transgender people do not want this, or at least dont want the spotlight on them for being trans. They just want normal lives. If stealth is not your thing then don't do it.

I don't walk around telling people I'm trans but neither would I deny it.  That is my choice and it is apparently yours.  I don't even do it because I think it's altruistic or in some way beneficial to the community.  I do it because it's the absolute lowest stress life I can imagine for myself.  I don't ever have to care whether I get clocked.  But we don't have any right to tell other people how to live.  If they want to put being trans behind them...that is their right, and privilege assuming they can pull it off.  The opposite of stealth would be a situation like in India where ""transgender"" is a legal identity and people who are trans are meant to accept that marker on their identity papers.  Would that seem like a preferable situation to you?  Exercising the right to transition is one of the ultimate expressions of self determination.  I don't see any reason why your right to self determination should be taken away from you at the end of transition.  If you want to be open, be open.  If you don't, then don't.

If it does match, you're cisgender.  The reason these terms have to exist is that let's say you want to talk about the experiences of trans vs non-trans people - you can't in fact just use 'people' to talk about the cisgender experience because people includes trans folks, and if you take 'people' to mean 'minus trans people', you're promoting the othering of trans folks.  Using precise terminology allows you to talk about the vast majority of people (cisgender folks) and trans folks without stigma. You can approximately get the same meaning as cisgender by saying 'not trans' but it's a little problematic and likely folks are going to think closeted trans folks are included in 'not trans'."
asktransgender,3dmirq,badschema,2,Fri Jul 17 14:58:23 2015 UTC,"The problem is they're not precise. They are historical now, but not precise. There are a lot of people who walk away entirely from the trans community because of this, and it might seem homogenous here, but we're not a homogenous community.  Because two girls were assumed male at birth is as far as it goes. Their life experiences, and the development of their identities, could be so radically different. Not to mention, a girl assumed female and girl assume male could have very similar life experiences and identities.  I totally disagree they are precise. They're an extreme, pigeonholing, othering, rigid-binary system. Just like Man-Woman. Cis-Trans to me is the same as the Man-Woman binary.  To each their own of course."
asktransgender,3dmirq,Hypatia_the_Wrathful,5,Fri Jul 17 15:01:34 2015 UTC,"You can, in fact, apply lots of labels to things. That's how precision works. That's how ADJECTIVES work."
asktransgender,3dmirq,badschema,0,Fri Jul 17 15:21:12 2015 UTC,"Sure, and then they break down and start pigeonholing people. I rather go global and have two overlapping groups, than go local and have 20,000 groups with a 1000 different qualifiers attached to each one. That's just how I see it.  I see myself as a gender minority, not trans. That's how I work.  Precise always breaks down at some point in our universe. Precise is just to the depth we understand it, but sometimes going at things with a more global perspective gives more insight than enumerating a thousand plus different cases because of an old classification system.  To me, cis and trans have broke down. Their time is up in my mind. They're no longer helpful, and now having negative consequences to me. But that's just me and how I see the world."

In the same way that taxonomists have an hierarchy of classification, most other things do as well. Problem is, they tend not to be as formal.  The key element that needs to be understood though is that we're discussing people when we're using these terms, and that means there will always be exceptions, and that's okay.  Edit: I recall you're something of a mathematician. Think set theory. Best parallel I can make."
asktransgender,3dmirq,Hypatia_the_Wrathful,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:24:33 2015 UTC,"As I am a mathematician, I know of cases, where they had a thousand different examples under one classification, and then found a larger, simpler global group that made more sense of them. And I am thinking it sets.  The notion that cis and trans are completely separate groups, with uniformity inside them is what I'm going at. They're not entirely separate if you stop using the classification of assumption at birth. And there is definitely no uniformity within that classification system.  Sometimes it is helpful to rename things than cling to old systems that aren't accurate.  There is too much focus on assumption at birth, but the bigots want that, because this system is in their favor as far as power goes, and then they can tell people how to think of their lives, their births, and their pasts.  I rather do away with another rigid binary that supposedly has no overlaps. My gender is far from common, I'm a minority, but I define my experiences and identity to be female, not trans, not trans female, nor anything else. Trans is a label given to us by a heavily sexist, gatekeeping medical world from the middle of last century. I see it as harmful now."
asktransgender,3dmirq,Artemis_in_Exile,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:30:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, in principle. But I also don't think of trans and cis as being non-intersecting sets, and as categories they're fluid, not rigid.  I'm not sure how realistic I'd consider dropping them entirely is; it's probably easier to shift the definition at this point than to drop the terms entirely. ""Queer"" comes to mind, and that was a less ubiquitous term than ""trans"". ""Cis"" as a word could still easily be dropped, but I think it would end up just being replaced by something of the exact same nature, or worse - ""normal""."
asktransgender,3dmirq,Hypatia_the_Wrathful,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:42:54 2015 UTC,"I'm under the impression almost everyone sees Cis and Trans as non-intersecting sets. At least in my four years here in this subreddit, what I've walked away with is most everyone sees you as a perfect binary, cis or trans, just the way man and woman was used to be.  Queer doesn't work either because I'm very straight. Queer is a word for sexuality minorities, not gender minorities per se.   but I think it would end up just being replaced by something of the exact same nature, or worse - ""normal"".   I don't think so. White people are not normal, and black people not normal because they're the minority.  There seems to be a lot of opposition to the term minority here, but I see it very radically different than what I'm getting here. But that's why people like me walk away too and won't be apart of the trans community forever. The trans community often has a very homogenizing view of things, and has its own rules of conformity.  I am a female gender minority, not a transgender person nor trans person. I aligned my biology with medical assistance.

In general, there aren’t too many places outside of a dictionary or chemistry lab where one would likely see the prefix being used, but cisgender is seeing an uptick in use.   So that's from Time Magazine."
asktransgender,3dmirq,Hypatia_the_Wrathful,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:18:15 2015 UTC,It may help to look at another terminological divide. Are you familiar with the word neurotypical.

Neurologically typical seems to be saying 'norma'. If that's what it means, why does it matter what the word is?

asktransgender,3dmirq,Hypatia_the_Wrathful,2,Fri Jul 17 15:52:33 2015 UTC,"That's sort of precisely the thing.  If you're not 'normal', you're 'weird' or 'eww'.  These words don't pretend there's some big 'normal' population to be othered from, and don't assume the typical experience is inherently the good one that everybody should be, and that everybody who isn't it is somehow broken, wrong, etc.  Having the word 'neurotypical' to refer to aspects of your experience gives you a way to think about differences (and hey, weirdly, maybe commonalities too!) with respect to folks who are meaningfully on the autism spectrum, for example, without treating everyday human variance as super weird and icky."
asktransgender,3dmirq,RevengeOfSalmacis,2,Fri Jul 17 16:18:20 2015 UTC,"So I think this is an example of rhetoric coming in stages. I'm a woman. I was assigned male. It took me some years to come to terms with that, but my identity isn't very complicated at this point. The memetic cluster that ""woman"" signifies works really well for me.  Fifty years ago, the public at large would have called me a transsexual, or a transsexual male if they were aware of the existence of trans men. Women not assigned male at birth would just have been called women.   Ten years ago, I'd have been a transwoman at best, no space, or a male to female transsexual, and women not assigned at birth were just ""normal women"" (or, more insultingly, ""genetic/biological women"").  Cis is an alternative to ""normal"". It others us less, and it's pretty easy to request it under the rubric of ""it's more precise, 'normal' could mean 'not fat' or 'not tall' or 'not black' or 'not rich' just as easily as 'not trans'.""  I don't think cis vs trans is actually the linguistic endpoint here, but for now it's better than the alternatives that preceded it. Hopefully in a decade or two I'll just be called a woman, and in a medical context ""a woman who transitioned"" with more details only as needed."

Transitioned from what? Here is the problem I see with cis-trans. A boy, a man, a male? Sorry no. Why is my brain and gender (identity) being dismissed in a world of mind over matter?  I like the word aligned over transition. I didn't transition genders. I didn't change, nor cross, nor anything of the such of ""trans"" my gender. I aligned my misaligned body and mind with my gender."
asktransgender,3dmirq,RevengeOfSalmacis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:08:14 2015 UTC,"Aligned? I like that.   I mean, I've been seeing it as ""transitioned from having an androgenic body and living rather uncomfortably in a male social role""--but if I were asked to describe how it's felt, it's felt less like a process of movement between two distinct states and more like removing incongruities and straightening out crooked joints. Bit by bit, things made more sense or nagged me less. I guess it's felt more like cleaning up a very dirty room and replacing Ikea furniture with the heirloom stuff that was always in storage for when I got my act together.   And as much as I'm hoping for total societal acceptance in the near future (rather than the conditional acceptance I get by blending, by being feminine enough to participate in femininity as a native speaker, and by being fairly attractive), and as good as my immediate circle is about it, I'm still very cautious about the future. I definitely have a lot of hope, but also caution.

And depsite they know that a ""trans"" girl can grow up with very, very similar experiences despite the doctor's assumption of male at birth, they wave this huge hand of dismisal saying we can have no understanding of what they went through. Seems like a power grab.  This word trans, comes from Transsexual. Which is intimately related to the gatekeeping and the hierarchy of transsexuals that Harry made and we are still trying to escape today.  So many people just blindly pick up words like:   pass, stealth, cis-trans, transition, biological, genetic   And in the face of not realizing who made them, the power structures around them, and also the ignorance in words such as biological and genetic.  I see ""cis"" people, often ""cis"" female feminists needing to other us because of some ""sacredness"" which really is masking a power grab. That is, they need to be higher on a hierarchy than someone, might as well be us. I am not society's assumption of me at birth. Feminists often used to say we are not our vaginas, well I say:   I'm not your assumption of me when I was two minutes old.   I feel we need to change our vocab drastically. We've swallowed hook-line-and-sinker all this awful vocab, and I think it is time for us to make our own stand without sexual minorities ""leading us"" and define for ourselves our own words.

Not everyone is both, but LGBT makes it seem like we're in unison, and we're not, and some of us are heterosexual, or in the sexual majority.   Yeah, I can get on the GSM bandwagon as long as GM and SM are kept somewhat conceptually separate, which is evidently why you usually don't seem to abbreviate gender minority.    sex is your whole body, including a lot things, and also including your neurology. And if neurobiologists keep the pace they are, we'll for certain show gender identity is a physical, neurological structure. That is, a part of our sex. The notion that sex is just genitals.... Outmoded, outdated, and factually incorrect. Our whole beings are our sex, including our brains.   I'm in complete agreement, but I back off actually making neurobiology claims I'm not qualified to (my degrees are in making gossip about people who don't exist, with a secondary concentration in teaching other people to form coherent documents), so I usually back it out to ""there is evidently some kind of neurobiological reason that testosterone made me miserable and androgenic morphology never sat right with me; we don't know how it works yet, but it's a striking effect that still exists when you control for culture and obviously isn't coming from any other part of the body,"" and then I use software driver analogies because all my friends are mildly to extremely tech savvy.    ""Gender is socially constructed and sex is biological"" Second wave garbage. The irony that these feminists fought tooth and nail to say they are not their vaginas, and then turn around reduce themselves to their natal vaginas.    Yeahhhhh. I've found that when talking to anyone who doesn't have a strong ideological commitment against us, it's pretty easy to talk about endogenous endocrinology, the resulting morphology, and genitals as something to be navigated rather than something that defines you. It may be that some of my ease comes from looking and sounding normatively female enough that most other women don't subconsciously other me very much, but I usually approach my body's history from an ""imagine your body doing this to you; I felt pretty much how you'd feel about it"" angle, which draws most of its validity from the fact that the body map or sense of body congruity or what-have-you is an actual thing for most people, just not one they actually have to think about very often, so if I can invoke it, it seems to help clarify matters.    However, not to dismiss the realness of it, my body wasn't always as aligned with the majority's femaleness as it is now. I saw the dark sides of sexism, and male sexual objectification when they assumed I was a male/boy/man/whatever-I-was-not.    This is very true. I'd also say to that: society ensures everyone gets the script for both genders, then applies coercive pressure to force everyone to play the part they've been underlined. I still remember my mother laughing at me when I played pregnant at three or four; although my understanding of gender was very vague (and although I did my best to butch up and convince myself I was male after some negative experiences in early puberty), I had a clear sense first that pregnancy and motherhood were things I was destined to navigate, and then that I was being mocked for my failure to realize that for some reason I should ignore those signals. Indeed, I think it would be impossible for women to police masculinity and men to police femininity if the societal expectations weren't available to everyone. (And looking back I'm stunned by the sheer energy that other people expended, without  them always even realizing it, to coerce me.)   It's like they're trying to make their suffering sacred. While at the same time dismissing both science and a group of people suffering along side of them with many of the same things happening to them.   It's an intellectually incoherent position and a really shitty basis for future equality. I like to think that the suffering-and-struggle second-wave model is largely losing its power in favor of serious intersectionality, but I'm not entirely sure. My RL friends, most of whom are perfectly effective feminists in their actions and lives, generally avoid the label out of distaste for the second-wave-inculcated reputation feminism now has. I do embrace the feminist label, but I'm kind of a walking conversation about what feminism means whether I like it or not, so there's no reason not to. :P    The medical world started the othering of us. The medical world gave us the root of the bigotry against us with their definition of a ""true transsexual."" The medical world then fed certain militant lesbian feminists groups to attack us legally blocking our medical care   In my undergraduate campus library, Benjamin's book was right next to Janice Raymond's, on an obscure shelf somewhere in HQ right between books about gay men and books about prostitution. In 2007, when Whipping Girl came out, it joined the tiny little trans ghetto about two titles away from The Transsexual Empire. Fortunately, that whole faction has lost most of its power since the mid-1980s, but I still have a visceral fear-rage reaction.   this whole new, rigid, non-intersecting, cis-trans binary is not the answer    I think I'm pretty much convinced that cis and trans need to be retired as terms, but I'm daunted by the idea of how. Most of my friends don't seem at huge pains to find ways to other me, but most of my friends seem more interested in learning and accepting than sorting and pontificating, and this is a rare trait. So I'm still not sure how to navigate the fact that a lot of non-trans people will really really really want a way to say they're not trans. Cis has had the benefit that it isn't ""normal"" or ""real"" or ""biological,"" all horribly othering terms, but you've convinced me. Now how to maneuver?    I really like GSM and GM for myself   Hm. ""Gender majority"" vs ""gender minority"" then? ""Of course, most women belong to a gender majority which must navigate gender roles but does not require major interventions to bring their bodies and social presence into alignment with their neurobiology, but I'm part of a gender minority."" I'm trying to work with that terminology, but in my hands it feels kind of vague right now, and I really think the best language is a lot more precise. Maybe I'm using it wrong, and instead it should be something more like ""my body developed along male lines and everyone thought I was male, because there's a default assumption in our society that people don't belong to gender minorities, but everyone was mistaken. I'm female, I needed to bring my body into alignment, and it's not terribly surprising that I embrace a social role pretty similar to a lot of other people who happen to be female. Mimesis is how humans make sense of reality, after all."""

I like gender majority and gender minority. I think we fail in trying to find precision. If we're dealing with uncountable infinity, then trying to discretize it is a failure in of itself. It's not capable of being discretize and made to fit into countable sets. I feel this way about gender. I feel like it has many, many variables, and more than we've found. I feel like everyone is on a continuum as well. I think if we keep trying enumerate we're going to end up with a string of variables infinitely long and still not capture it all. That tells me we're dealing with a bigger set, and you need to look for things that can overlap and possible be fluid. Gender majority and gender minority overlap in a person's life, and they're fluid."

I guess I must overcome the longing for everything to have a discrete and absolute true name. (I read once the ancient Egyptians did not have dictionaries, only word lists, for they believed that every word was also a perfect definition of the thing named. It's a pervasive dream. But evidently it's also a convenient fiction, and sometimes, as in this case, a really inconvenient fiction.)   I look forward to talking about this more; I'm looking for a better methodology to practice and model, and the limitations of the old one are becoming really apparent."
asktransgender,3dmirq,Asher-D,-1,Fri Jul 17 21:36:54 2015 UTC,"Cis is an alternative to ""normal"".

That's a description of morphology. The concept of others us less is in particular disturbing to me, because I have quoted, in Time, which is fairly mainstream and believed, that it is an us and them thing. Just because the wording isn't explicit doesn't mean it's not still us versus them?  I guess I see it as trying to soften the touch when degrading someone."

My friends and I almost never use cis or trans; they're pretty freaking good about just seeing me as a woman with some body issues that need straightening out.   (Anecdote follows: One of my partners in crime--for whom I'll be a bridesmaid in April--was slightly surprised a year ago when she realized I was scared to use the women's room in public, and then marched me calmly in there, waited until I had taken care of things, and never brought it up again. She also thinks I should write a breakup letter to my current genital configuration--okay, I admit it, we're both trollx subscribers and it shows in our friendship--and she figures she'd do pre-srs penis puppetry were she in my situation. In short, she treats me exactly like she'd treat any other girl friend with a weird physical issue that needs sorting out, we joke around from a place where there's no asterisk on my womanhood, and you know what? It helps a lot.)  Long term I agree with you that cis isn't needful. Short term, the alternative is ""trans women"" vs ""real women"" or ""normal women."""

The default assumption of folks tends to be that one is artificial and constructed while the other is authentic and natural.   The main difference between those ""born"" as their identified gender and trans* folk is that we have to live our own intrinsic and indelible understanding of ourselves in the face of constant questioning and criticism. In this light, having your birth-assigned sex match your real sex is just a happy accident, and doesn't grant any special authenticity to who you are. The term ""cis-sexual"" reflects this fundamental equality with trans*-folk in a way that ""non-trans*"" doesn't."

If you feel strongly that (1) is the best, then while I agree with the sentiment, I'd say we need the distinction at the very least to be able to talk about treatments.  If we go with (2), then what should the labels be? Here's what I meant by ""trans*""/""cis*"" being a more equal (or balanced or fair) set of terms: Simply using ""trans*"" and ""normal"" makes the former by definition abnormal, which I object to as stigmatizing. The same goes in a milder sense for ""non-trans*"". So as long as we need to make a distinction ""cis*"" is the best term we have for non-trans* individuals."

And in the irony of fighting a rigid binary there is one created. Gender minority encompasses everything, from binary, to non-binary, to trans, to genderqueer, to even the intersex people, and to those of us who just can't see ourselves as any of these labels totally.

We did skip 4 years of thanksgivings due to them still treating my wife and I as kids (getting bumped BACK to the kids table while we HAD kids was offensive in my mind)... but after we ironed out the differences people realized that I wasn't going to play their games.

asktransgender,3dje7x,OrangeLaceChair,37,Sat Jul 18 02:10:15 2015 UTC,"When my kids were young, I let them have their hair cut anyway they wanted it. It was their hair, they were the ones who had to like it. With their clothes, they got to wear anything they liked, as long as it suited the weather. No you can't just wear a singlet and nothing else, it's the middle of winter.  Neither of my kids are trans, but I think this helped with their own identity. One of them wore a life jacket every day for weeks, because he liked the colour. I tore shreds off anyone who made fun of him for it. He wasn't harming anyone, and he was happy, so who was anyone to question it.  One of my kids wanted a baby doll for Christmas, he got a doll. The family where up in arms about it not being right. He would mother it, care for it, bath it, and when it came time for bed, he would kick it like a football to get it into bed.   Personally I think as a parent we have the responsibility to make our children feel safe to explore their world, so they can understand and appreciate it better. It doesn't mean giving them everything they want, but they should know they have a happy and safe place to exist and be honest."

Also you sound like an awesome parent :) I like my parents and today they are supportive of me, but growing up was kind of tough because I felt pressure to conform to being ""male"", which was upsetting. I never quite knew why exactly, but I always dreaded getting my hair cut, and would always be sad for awhile after the haircut had happened. I also would occasionally be told not to do certain things, or to behave in certain ways, because that was ""girly"" and I was a ""boy"" and thus not supposed to do that. blegh.

It's not about the interests of the kids, it's about her not having to do anything in life and everyone feel sorry for her being ""forced"" to live like that.  My kids are under enough pressure living in that environment, I'm not going to make it harder for them by forcing them to see me. From all the court documents I've seen my kids have been poisoned against me, and I've been accused of nearly every crime under the sun. I can only hope in time things change, and they work out the truth for themselves."
asktransgender,3dje7x,OrangeLaceChair,2,Fri Jul 17 00:15:52 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear that. If it's any help to you, I was in a similar situation with my parents growing up. Neither of them were trans but they went through a rather unpleasant breakup around the time I was born and I ended up living with my mother and her parents. She fed me lie after lie about my dad and because of that I grew up hating him and wanting nothing to do with him at all. I had fortnightly contact with him but then one time that day came around I threatened to jump out the upstairs window ( I was about 5/6 at the time) and after that contact stopped. Despite how I felt about him, I never actually had any bad memories or experiences with him, it was all based on what my mother had told me he'd done and what he was like. Then when I was around 14, my mother became extremely manipulative and abusive and really showed her true colours. It was made illegal for her to care for me anymore and I moved in with my grandparents while she had some homeless druggie sleeping in my bed at her house. My father was made aware of the situation and we ended up talking to each other online regularly and he gave me his side of the story of what happened when they were still together. From putting together the pieces and having seen what my mother was like first hand, it became clear that she's lied to me growing up and that he was actually an alright guy who had to put up the same crap I did off of her. We live a considerable distance away from each other now but we still talk regulary over fb and he comes down to see me every now and then and we have a positive relationship, despite being brought up to think he was some sort of evil, abusive arsehole. Turns out that was my mother instead.  Point is, just because a kid is raised to hate one parent by the other parent, there will come a time when they want the truth for themselves and they'll see through whatever lies they might have been told, and with the internet, fb and everything else we have now it's incredibly hard to keep two people from ever contacting each other. Things probably seem crap now but there will come a time when your kids will realise that not everthing they may have been told is true and they'll seek out the truth by themselves. I think it's probably best to just wait and let them do it on they're own terms when they're ready, if my dad had forced himself into my life earlier before I learnt the truth then I'd have just hated him even more for it and wanted nothing to do with him probably. Just make sure to let them know you still love them and things will work out eventually."

However, because I don't see anyone else saying this, I feel the need to point out that only about 23% of children who behave this way as a child experience persistent gender dysphoria throughout life. I don't say this to invalidate your child or your parenting. Honestly, I wish that everybody had parents as accepting and supportive as you seem. I wouldn't even be commenting now except that under an hour ago I read the Endocrine Society's prescription guideline for HRT and it addressed these exact scenarios and recommend against having the child completely change social roles so early in life for this reason: in the vast majority of cases, the child simply ends up identifying as their gender assigned at birth, and living as the other gender for so long can cause serious damage to their emotional and social wellbeing. If you haven't, please look into this."

Some of them you're already doing by the sounds of it, so those are more of a social commentary. I'm not saying all of these ideas will work, it's just the kind of stuff I would think about as a parent, and some of the things I wished my parents had done for me.   Pronouns: ask them what pronouns they would like used, and be happy to change it on a daily basis, to whatever they feel comfortable with.  Hair cuts: an adjustment in the terms used. Instead of saying they need a hair cut, ask if they would like their hair trimmed to look nicer.  Nails: let them paint their nails if they like. Lots of kids like colours, so if anyone in public makes comment, fob it off as a kid being a kid, no need to make a big scene about it.  Clothes: Maybe buy some pyjamas for them to wear at night. You could buy them, leave them on their bed, and say that you got them, if they want to wear them. No need again to make a big scene, apart from saying they look nice. If you're out shopping and there is a dress they like, why not buy it for them to wear. You don't have to do it there and then, maybe leave it as a surprise in their wardrobe for them to find, and to wear if they want.  I think importantly it's about them having options, instead of it being a sudden change. It's about building up experience, so they can make an informed decision about what they feel comfortable with.  I'd love to hear any feedback regarding these ideas. Particularly from those in the situation."

I had special needs and nobody seemed to understand it, and they also seemed to think that their opinion on the situation was necessary for some god awful reason... even if they were barely involved in my life.

It will be hard, but it will get easier. as you continue on your journey, people will either come around or you'll find new people. You are doing the right thing!   I'm not sure if it would help your loved ones understand, but you could tell them about how much you've researched about this and how the leading research says that allowing your child the space to explore gender and expression is the best thing for the child's overall mental health and development. It also might help to tell them that gender identity is not a thing that can be ""taught"" or ""caught"" (ie by spending 'too much' time with you). in fact there's research that gender identity is more or less established by age 2 or 3, and no amount of outside pressure can change the child's internal sense of gender. they likely don't even have the language to understand or discuss their gender, unless we teach them (and that goes for ALL kids, not just gender expansive ones).   what outside pressure CAN do though, is shame the child into burying their gender and/or their presentation preferences and try to be someone they're told they should want to be-- which is shown in the research (and personal experiences) to be very psychologically damaging.   Your child is definitely showing some clear signs of being transgender. One book that I personally like and I know has been helpful to a lot of people is The Transgender Child.   For books for your kid that has been helpful for trans* kids in my life, some recommendations are:   10,000 Dresses  I am Jazz My Princess Boy The Adventures of Tulip, Birthday Wish Fairy  and Backwards Day (last two are over at flamingo rampant with other new ones i haven't seen yet!)   it can also help a lot for you to find community (whether online or in person) with other parents of gender expansive kids. And it can help your kid a lot have trans* / gender expansive kids to be friends with and even trans* adults to be at least acquainted with. If you can afford it, travelling to conferences can be GREAT for having your kid be in an affirming space with other trans* kids. There's the Gender Spectrum Conference on the west coast, and this year we held the first east coast conference over here. There's also Philly Trans Health which is all ages whereas Gender Spectrum is focused on kids / parents. There's also a couple sleep away camps for gender expansive youth, when your kiddo gets older.  It can be good for you to look into local groups too-- some areas even have meetings/support groups specifically for parents of transgender kids. Some will only have more general meetings for parents of LGBTQ kids  i hope this helps and please let me know if there's anything else i can do to help."

I do not claim to have read anything but from the tone they are not critical of transwomen. They seem to be critical of the system giving us a thought as such. I dont care to debate theories. The end result seems they do not seem fucked by us, just vexxed by the lack of cohesiveness and factualness. But are very open and frankly better people than most.  One lady got rape threats from transwomen in her pm box apparently for expressing her views. I can see why they might be offensive. That is awful domineering and agressive."
asktransgender,3dnfuw,NonasNonce,2,Fri Jul 17 21:53:37 2015 UTC,Ah I see so you agree with some of their points. So you don't get offended by them? Or you know what they're trying to say and what they're trying to say isn't what other people think they're trying to say?

I don't know jack about that subreddit, their people, or anything, I haven't delved in, this was a cursory glance.  I've seen them poke fun at Catilyn Jenning, but that's free game as anyone can mock someone. Women mock eachother all the time for how they look, act, etc.  But I mean, so what?  That's not transphobic. Not in my mind, there were some unique bits about her presentation, stride, voice, enunciation. Not that they were flawed, just exagerated. I see no reason why someone so highly public is not given that same freedom to be poked fun of.  So for the whole gender thing, if what I read IN BRIEF was correct, they want to destroy the concept of gender. Some might have the regard that being forced into using terminology as cis/trans as identifying markers is buying into gender theory.  Anyone care to refute with knowledge? References too please!"

At the time, his name was Gregory Gorgeous and he did tutorials on makeup and I thought it was wonderful that he ignored harmful gender roles and knew that guys liking makeup was ok, and wearing it didn't mean he was a woman.   __   So when a man I had been dating for a while told me he was trans and to call him by his new female name (and it was as ridiculous of a trans name as they always are)   A headline like this:    Listen to baritone Brucey Bruce and all his sexist stereotypes as he accepts the Arthur Ashe Courage Award.   __   If an MtT is acting inappropriately, women feel like they can't stand up to this and tell the offender to leave because no one wants to be a so-called ""TERF"" or a transphobe.    They call MtF people MtT. Presumably Male to Trans. The assumption in that statement is that they are not transitioning to females, but to some other, non- female character.  All in all, there's a lot of hate towards us over there. They don't just not buy into gender theory. They constantly invalidate our identities, call us names, mock us, make us out to be ""weirdos"" and ""crazies"".

I'm going to stop here before I go on a rant about how radical feminism is BS and how this ""patriarchy"" is just imaginary. If women were in charge, there would still be wars and terrible atrocities committed because us humans are a terrible species. De-powering men and empowering women is just going to be the reverse of what we see, with a matriarchy instead of a ""patriarchy"", but for real instead of being a mental boogieman. Having intelligent, rational, and tolerant people in charge will.  But, sure, white cisgender, heterosexual women are oppressed. Who cares about racism still being an issue in most of the ""civilized world"", or militant extremists, or transphobia and homophobia existing?  EDIT: Well, I didn't exactly expect the downvotes here. The beginning part was intended as a snarky joke.  Let me explain what I mean: I don't mind people fighting for equal rights. But equal rights means equal rights. No double-standards, no ""it's okay for a girl to do this while a guy is unable to do so and vice versa"" excuses, etc. If someone does something criminal, they should not get special treatment because they are an ethnic minority or an ethnic majority.  It's saddening to see ""a man punched by a woman"" as comedy while ""a man punching a woman"" is dramatic. It's saddening to see some women who had sex they didn't like or raping a man claim that they were raped and the man put in jail. Consequences of an action should be the same no matter what sex, gender identity, ethnicity, language, and homecountry you have."

In my interactions with anti-trans self-styled radicals, I get the impression that at least as regards trans issues they're reactionaries, but since I'm not interested in debating whether I exist, I imagine they may have some ideas I could benefit from exposure to. But I judge the stress and strain of talking to people who don't think I exist about whether I exist outweighs any possible benefits, and the hate group connections to that whole circle don't improve my receptivity.

I don't want to change my existing government documents, I want nothing to do with them anymore because I've seen other people change them and have the system fuck up. I'll just get new stuff in a new state, but to do that I need some id padding that won't have both my names in their system.    It's broken for people just getting a name change, or switching their surname when married.    Who accepts Birth Certificate copies signed by JPs as proof of ID? Will a bank take that?

My license number didn't change, nor did my tax file number, but Medicare did renumber me (only the last digit changed)  As for non-governmental stuff like utilities, they usually assumed I'm the wife or twin sister of the previous account holder, and were happy to switch things over. If they need ID, just switch to a different form this time (eg passport instead of license).  In some cases, the challenge was the ones that refused to believe I was the same person. I had a bunch of fun convincing the records department at the hospital that I'm not a set of twins. The similar but non-identical Medicare numbers didn't help, and I had to resort to pulling out the birth certificate with both names on it to force their hand."

Turns out they still had my old name on the system, and under that name I was a match for someone who may need bone marrow.

They actively look for that sort of thing, including cross-matching the databases.  By ""don't care"" I mean more that as long as my records are in order, no government employee I've dealt with gives a shit that I'm trans (or at least if they do, they keep it to themselves which is good enough for me).  It occurs to me that you could probably politely ask Centrelink and the ATO to reissue ID numbers for privacy reasons, they might be willing to do that. You'd still be one person in their system, but you'd be able to remain separate in third party databases (eg former employers, job network agencies etc)."

My change of name certificate was mailed out to my old name with the wrong spelling to my home address rather than my requested postal address. I've heard of people claiming they have more children than they do and getting benefits for that and not being caught for a very long time, if ever. None of my friends tell Centrelink about their part time jobs, some of them do their taxes, some don't, and their employers have had their TFNs for years... but it seems like no one checks anything unless someone is dobbing someone else in.    So if I'm not scamming the system, would they actually check anything? If the laws change in a few years and I'm able to get my sex marker changed I think NSW BDM lets you erase your previous name from your birth certificate and your old name sits behind some kind of court seal. At that point would any general name change checking fail? Sine it'd probably operate like an adoption name change.    If there was an active check for people's previous names, why would they ask for previous names to be provided on forms? Shouldn't they just run a full check anyway and all the names would just pop up?"

I got dug into when my flatmate screwed up his income reporting one time. Even if you weren't scamming, it would look like you were, and if you accidentally got overpaid a single dollar, you can bet they'll be assholes about it. How would you make sure you got taxed correctly if you have two TFNs, and  two tax-free thresholds?  Everyone asks for all your names for a few reasons. Firstly, it's easier to find honest mistakes if honest people disclose that information. Second, if you're dishonest, the form is already proof of that before they dig deeper.   I'm led to believe that's part of the rationale behind those Working With Children forms. If someone is not allowed to work with children, just signing that form is already enough to get them in trouble before anything else happens.

If I become unemployed after that I apply for Centrelink in my new name. Only ever lodge Tax in my new name after that and forget the old one. The tax office probably won't look for me too hard and if they ever do it'll be so many years later and they'll see I've been lodging taxes in my new number that they'll probably just chalk it up to some error and move on to looking for people who are actually scamming them.    ""The way you're supposed to"" do things is be straight, cis, and never do something as bureaucratically annoying as change your legal name unless you're a woman who has just gotten married. Soon enough everyone is going to have to take gender education in school so I can't hide in public, everyone will know exactly what to look for to clock a trans person.

On the other hand, they have footed a great deal of my living, medical, and unexpected expenses. It is difficult living at home when I want to explore who I really am. I find myself an introvert trapped in what should be her safe place. My counselor has helped me come up with worst case contingencies, so I'm almost tempted to just out myself and be done with it. I dunno how old you are, but there are places to go if the fam responds poorly, if things get too awkward, or if they just decide to kick us out.

Whilst its no fun to be pushed you have the chance to change your life fir the better.  Who know they might be more responsive than you think?
asktransgender,3dl2kn,jessicasecret,10,Fri Jul 17 03:28:29 2015 UTC,"My mother was very worried about how her parents would react to my transition. My grandmother is Catholic, and although she's non-practicing now, her faith is still important to her. I'd been on HRT for two months, and boymode was already in the early stages of failing, so I arranged to visit. Mum got in a real tizz - should she tell them before I visit, should she tell them I was going to tell them something important when I visit, should she be there when I tell them, etc. I managed to convince her that I'd be fine, and I'd just come and tell them, and I'd deal with their reaction.   I leaned hard into boymode to visit (that was the last time I ever did more than half-hearted boy-fail). We sat together in the loungeroom and I explained.  Their reaction was surprising. From their perspective, I was telling them that their grandchild who had been depressed, anxious, even borderline suicidal, had figured out what was necessary to feel better, and that was fantastic news. It turns out that one of my Nan's brothers was gay, and another crossdressed (though they only discovered that after he died). My grandparents were onboard with LGBT issues since before my parents were even born.  Just after this, my aunt ""was just passing by and decided to drop in"" with a tone of voice that made it clear that Mum had suggested it. We all sat and talked about it a bit more, and that was that. A few months later, I came back in girlmode and they were 100% on my new name and pronouns.   TLDR: sometimes people can surprise you."

That being said, you don't have to do penetration if you don't want. It's your business, so you'll have to figure something out that works for both of you.

Plenty of cis men who are into women enjoy being penetrated, it may not be the norm, but it's not uncommon at all. I think it's kind of unfair to judge how he wants to have sex as not man enough, but you are also entitled to your own feelings about it. I'm assuming you're a girl."

It's a footnote in conversation at best in many cases.   And the trans side of things has a long way to go as well. But we have the benefit of the lgb brothers, sisters, and allies to thank as our road has been made easier thanks to their work and efforts.

It helps to see a therapist about issues like this as being young and trans sucks. People question your certainty and try to convince you that you are not trans even if you know you are.
asktransgender,3dla7i,illuminess,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:45:46 2015 UTC,"Only you can know the answer. Maybe you're genderfluid / non-binary.   What ever the case, Express who you are. Explore yourself a bit maybe even try to get on androgen blockers.   But what this means is having a serious talk with your parents. Explain to them how you feel. Also seek a gender therapist to assist you with what you're feeling.   But again only you KNOW if you are or arn't. You might not think you are now, but later you realize you are.   Or you might think you are now but later you realize you arn't.   Thats why at this age androgen blockers for the most part are the only things you can do until you find out and really explore yourself.   I know i'm repeating and not really saying much. But what I'm trying to say is no one can tell you. Don't you ever let someone tell you WHO YOU ARE, because you are YOU! You are beautiful, and amazing no matter what you do.   As a side note there is no scientific correlation between being raised by only females and being trans.   Be strong, be brave, and just do what you want to do, wear what you want to wear and be you.  This is something I wish I knew when I was your age. Talk to your mother and grandmother.    13 years ago I was in your shoes. It was a long road to discovery and keeping myself hidden. But when I finally let go, and showed myself I am a million times more happy than I ever have been.   Now its not all butterflies and rainbows, I still get sad, and its not easy.

It has a short expiration that could be for a few reasons. It could be loss of potency or ""toxicity"" but most likely it is a sterility issue. It may or may not have preservatives in it or its sterility may only be for a short period of time. This is why you don't want to go past expiry. Our body has a great barrier (skin) that keeps a lot of bugs out of our system. Injecting non-sterile drugs bypasses this barrier and can introduce the bugs directly into the blood.

It's not fair and not fun, you should keep exploring and see what suits you best. I wouldn't suggest transitioning so that you can act how you like. People will police your expression though and try and make you choose a box."

It could also be that you'd just like to express your feminine side more, be a gender nonconforming guy. Experiment, see how taking small steps toward expressing your femininity makes you feel - whether that's enough, or you feel like you need more than that."

Idk it was just really crazy to me that i somehow dreamed something that i had never known. that dream along with a lot of other things helped me decide to transition. but yea ive read about a lot of people on here having dreams as a girl/ boy."
asktransgender,3dlfgh,JaseyRaeRadio,2,Fri Jul 17 06:09:48 2015 UTC,"I've had several dreams throughout my life where I'm (in one way or another) a girl. Most of these dreams were from when I was a child (I very very rarely remember dreams as an adult, maybe 1 or 2 every year, usually nightmares). However, just the other week I had a dream where I was at work, I had transitioned and everyone knew and was cool with it, my parents were there (for some reason) and they knew and were supportive (almost certainly won't be like this) it was a very boring dream, nothing remotely interesting was happening, but it was so casually normal with me as a girl that it was very pleasant. I also wouldn't mind having more dreams like this."
asktransgender,3dlcid,randomtransgirl93,3,Fri Jul 17 05:08:17 2015 UTC,"I don't usually have very much dysmorphia   Just fyi, the correct word is dysphoria. Dysmorphia is for when someone sees an aspect of their body unrealistically, like an anorexic person who thinks they need to lose weight but is really unhealthily skinny.   I just don't really know how to get past this. In one way or another everything else I don't like about my body can be changed. My height is going to be with me forever.   I understand how you feel, I'm not quite as tall as you (6'2"") but still much taller than the average woman. I also struggle with this (as well as some other things like shoulder width that I can't change), basically the best advice is just own it. You might get some slight height shrinkage from HRT (some other girls have posted about how they lost an inch or two) but for the most part there is nothing you can do to change how tall you are, so don't invest too much thought in it. We're in a vulnerable state where we worry about our appearance a lot, but we're also our own worst enemies, we nit pick at every little thing that isn't just perfect (like a lot of women, lol). In the end most of what we worry about isn't going to be an issue. And like RevengeofSalmacis said, a lot of people find tall women attractive."
asktransgender,3dlcid,SerasVal,2,Fri Jul 17 15:47:20 2015 UTC,"I was 6'4 and am now 6'3, not sure why. It really hasn't been an issue in transition. At least from other girls, the impression I get is that tall is beautiful and they find my height graceful.   It's really not that big a deal. It just means your body is going to force you to look like an ex model. :p"
asktransgender,3dltfp,rememberone,4,Fri Jul 17 08:49:30 2015 UTC,"This problem isn't going to go away.  If you're going to transition, she needs to know, and you need to tell her. Maybe couples therapy will help, but it sounds like she's got some hang-ups that are stronger than your emotional bonds. Maybe those are resolvable, but maybe she doesn't want to have to deal with them.  At the end of the day, if your mind is set, delaying bringing this issue to a head is bad for both you and for her, and it's slowly robbing her of agency in her life. You've got an obligation to be realistic to her about where you imagine yourself being in 10 years, in 20 years. And you've got an obligation to yourself not to choose decades of misery and the slow death of a marriage."

asktransgender,3dltfp,Vathoska,2,Fri Jul 17 16:41:06 2015 UTC,"You are at a crossroads in life. You need to make a fundamental decision: transition or not. If you transition you  might lose many things including your family but you will also gain many things such as reduced dysphoria. If you don't transition you can keep your current life but you'll have to struggle with dysphoria for the rest of your life.  No one can make the decision for you. No one is going to be able to calculate the cost/benefits of this decision except you. Your therapist won't be able to decide for you. Your wife can't decide for you. YOU have to decide.   Also, remember the recent Supreme Court ruling. Every human has an inherent right to seek out their own happiness and express themselves with dignity. It's not selfish to do so. It's about being a more authentic person. If someone tells you that transition is selfish ignore them because they don't know what they're talking about. Being more authentic is never selfish. It's human."

Is it unusual that it doesn't really matter if people use my old name and pronouns to refer to things from prior to my transition? I might be a strange case anyway because I don't intend on even changing my name on my birth certificate. I feel like I've always been me and mentally male, but at least socially I used to be a girl named Laura and now I'm a guy named Taylor. I find it interesting how we all see things differently."
asktransgender,3diy05,taylor-in-progress,3,Thu Jul 16 17:56:43 2015 UTC,"No, it's not. Really, it is up to the person how they would like others to refer to ""past them,"" but if you don't know what they prefer, the safest answer is to use their current preferred pronouns and name.  Off topic, what made you decide to not change your birth certificate? I don't really want people referring to past me by my previous pronouns or my old name, but there's a part of me that feels weird about changing my birth certificate. Maybe because I haven't thought about it much, or because I am currently unable to change my gender on there. Maybe because it feels a bit like I'm trying to erase my history (and I'm not sure if it would really ever out me when I don't want to be outted.) It's just up in the air for me and I'm not sure what I'm going to end up doing."
asktransgender,3diy05,AlexaviortheBravier,4,Thu Jul 16 18:45:19 2015 UTC,"A large part of why I'm not changing it is that I can't change my gender marker so I kind of feel like ""why bother?"". Also, I want to be able to prove who I am through a chain of documents because I still have things in my birth name and married pre transition name that can't be easily changed. I feel better knowing I can prove all three identities by using my birth certificate, marriage license, and name change court order. Plus, once I get a passport I can just use that in almost any case where I'd need a birth certificate.  I also have no desire to be  stealth so my thinking is probably different than a lot of others would be.   Basically, I don't want to erase who I used to be. I just need to be someone else going forward."
asktransgender,3diy05,taylor-in-progress,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:06:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, I can definitely relate to a lot of this except I still haven't decided. I did always think I'd just get my passport changed to avoid having to use a birth certificate for anything. Never even thought about changing my birth certificate until someone else brought it up like it was a given. I also don't plan on being stealth though I still want control over disclosure of my past when it gets to a point where people wouldn't know otherwise. (Or at least not close the door on that, I don't know how future me will feel.)   At this time, I figure it'll be a decision I make when I would also have the option to change the gender marker.

I've noticed eating lots of dark greens or foods with good fats in them seem to help my hair along.  2) Again, eat well, but be wary of shampoo and/or hot water; they dry out your hair and make it frizzy. Not a fan, personally. Hair dyes and bleach wreck your hair too.  3) You can get it permanently straightened. It's a little expensive, and honestly I prefer the feeling of soft curly hair vs straight dry hair, but it's just preference at this point.  4) For hairstyles, just be wary of having hair pulled tight. It is said this can damage the follicle permanently if done in excess. Also hats are fun.  That's all I've got. Hope it helps."

It gets more complex because some people who initially believe it's just a fetish are, in fact, trans. I'm sure you can imagine why this sort of fantasy would be appealing to someone who is actually trans.   The thing is, you're missing the crucial element of ""wanting to live as a woman"".

For your case, you never wanted to, from what you said. You may just be like a crossdresser. I do have friends that thinks about being a girl all the time, because of all the benefits etc, but at the end of the they, they shy away from the topic of transitioning because they want to be a guy too.  Another scenario is that ,you have strongly suppressed your desire to transition to the point that you practically lost yourself. You'll have to ask yourself if you content with your life now.  And honestly, i don't get that ''I just trans asshole in denial?''  Are you implying that most trans people in denial are assholes ? honestly, you don't have to think too much.

Some people just see it as purely sexual even if it's not, and only explore it sexually. Nothing wrong with that. I mean really even if that was the persons sole reason, then if they weren't really trans they probably would detransition. Given experiencing gender dysphoria for the first time. And if they were trans than it is just a way for them to discover it.   And I don't really think it's weird, it's like a form of the shameful introverted narcissist. Once you come to terms with who you are though then typically it's stops being exciting to the same degree, and you may have some self love, but every individual does to a degree. Maybe more than others, but when you well you know your mind creates a link between it and sex, and then it's just association like any kink."
asktransgender,3dk7dd,NineQuietLessons,5,Fri Jul 17 02:11:23 2015 UTC,"You don't really need to justify your kinks. If you don't want to transition and you don't think you're trans...well, no one knows better than you.   AGP is still bullshit, though."
asktransgender,3dk7dd,Tsukeira,8,Thu Jul 16 23:02:38 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to differentiate between AGP as defined by Blanchard et. al and AGP as used by people to describe their own sexual fantasies.  It seems so weird to think about it now, but my exploration of my gender identity was ignited by seeing AGP in a physchology textbook (defined there as simply ""attraction to one's self as a woman"" or something like that).  It was something that I was able to identify with (ever since I started having sexual thoughts, I could only be aroused by imaging myself as a woman, never a man), and I was stunned that there was a term for it.  Up to that point, I had thought I was just a weirdo.  Putting AGP into Google let me to the blogs of people who also identified with the term, which them led me to trans blogs, and years later here I am.  In short, the term served as a first step for me when I was not yet able to admit that I might be trans.    All the said, Blanchard is still full of shit (fun fact: my first gender therapist studied directly under him)."
asktransgender,3dk7dd,NineQuietLessons,5,Thu Jul 16 23:34:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed. This is what I was trying to say: do some people get off on fantasies of being transformed/being/becoming the other gender? Sure. People get off on all kinds of stuff. But Blanchard's Autogynephilia specifically says that trans women who are attracted to women are men with a paraphilia, and that's the part that's bullshit.   For what it's worth, I used to think I was an autogynephiliac too. For about a decade, I thought that. That fucking pseudoscience gave me a way to convince myself I was still a guy, despite constantly dreaming about having a body like a cis girl. It cost me a decade of my life, so I can't say I feel any real positive emotions towards it."
asktransgender,3dk7dd,RevengeOfSalmacis,3,Fri Jul 17 00:21:02 2015 UTC,"The idea of agp repulsed me away from the idea that I could transition for a number of years, because I was convinced that the sadness and envy I felt looking at beautiful girls would make me a delusional fetishist man if I wanted to transition. The simpler answer--the one I knew and suppressed--was buried under my reaction of ""no, that is not me"" to the idea of agp.   The theory confuses the heck out of me now that I'm primarily attracted to men. I know what attraction feels like, and I know what envy inflamed by testosterone felt like, and they're very different. I'm not sure agp is a coherent idea; to me it seems a mangled misinterpretation of a symptom or two of being trans, but blown up into a grand theory."
asktransgender,3dk7dd,Tsukeira,3,Fri Jul 17 01:59:35 2015 UTC,"That's why I said we should differentiate between AGP as Blanchard defines it, and AGP as a term used by people who actually believe it is the best way to describe their sexuality and not as a way to undermine the identities of trans women.  I'm not defending Blanchard's theory, I'm just saying that I believe the term itself has a purpose for a certain group of people."

For my situation, it makes sense. When I was young I was consciously aware of not fitting my assigned gender and the fact that I didn't have any kind of sexual fantasies from a man's perspective just seemed to fit that. If a cisgender person tried to claim the fact that I had such thoughts as evidence of autogynephilia, I would ask them these questions:   What is your gender identity(meaning do you perceive yourself as male or female)? Do you have sexual fantasies that involve yourself? When having said sexual fantasies, are you imagining yourself as someone whose sex is the opposite of your gender identity?   The idea that someone who considers themself female has female sexual fantasies makes no less sense than the idea that someone who considers themself male has male sexual fantasies. Expecting someone who considers themself female to have male sexual fantasies is what doesn't make sense.   If you read about autogynephilia theory, it involves more than just fantasizing about being a woman, and even more, there doesn't seem to be any scientific basis for the claims behind it. The author seems to have taken his idea and worked backward to fit his claims.  It really doesn't matter to anyone else how you classify yourself and how you choose to present yourself outwardly. And it's not defined by a controversial term. If you realize that you're female, that's great. Use that knowledge to improve your life. If everything in your mind tells you that you're male, use that to improve your life.  The answer for this question is not for anyone but you to decide."

If you don't present well you might get stares but again, people won't really care. Transgenderism isn't not something the natives over there are familiar with. On the beach, you'll probably only encounter those who cater to the tourist industry. And those people work to bring home the dough and they won't want to deal with foreigners more than they already have to. In reality you're far more likely to face hostility from other tourists than the locals."

Although it frankly wouldn't matter whether you're transgendered or not, you'll get mugged all the same. If you go to a resort they take you on a bus with unbreakable glass and shuttle you from airport to resort because it's pretty much slums between there and your dream vacation. But that's more or less the reality of the Caribbean, tourists get to have their dream vacations within the safe confines of the walls of their resort while some poor afrocarribean boy is suffering a few miles away. You'll be safe with your groups and your resorts. If you do go to places on your own, don't walk, take a taxi. I think you're under the impression that people will attack you because you're transgendered. In reality if you do get attacked it's because people are poor and you're a foreigner with money. So just follow standard tourist common sense and you'll be absolutely fine. I've been to far worse places than the Caribbean and I am just fine. If you're still scared, go to one of the islands governed by the US or European nations which you're protected under the law. If you're still scared, then why are you even bothering to go on vacation? It's called an adventure for a reason."

For the sake of looking for yourself, assume I'm staying at Grand Roatan Resort, on west bay beach, and walking over to BananaRama dive and beach resort.  I'd much rather a condo because I'm familiar with it, know the owners, its a much large area with AC I can control, WiFi, TV, a full kitchen, a private pool, a back patio, privacy, security, etc.    We'd have a rental car and never really be walking anywhere sketchy.  My concerns are far less about being mugged, I can pretty much handle all that I'm not the absolute dumbest clueless american tourist.   My concerns more relate to my appearance and specific targeting because I'm trans and will be with my girlfriend (also trans), like a stab and run, or a group of people jumping us.

Outside their confines it can get very dangerous very fast, regardless of who u r but especially as an identifiable glbt person. This area is one of the worst in the world for glbt directed violence & discrimination. Look, most people everywhere are decent but there is extreme poverty, sky high crime rates (property & violent) and mass police corruption throughout the Caribbean basin countries and virulently anti-glbt religions dominate the whole basin--and about all of South America for that matter. If u venture outside the resort u book with, go with a group and stay with them. U r literally risking your life if u venture out by yourself in most counties down there. The most dangerous countries are Honduras (even str8 cis peeps avoid this hellhole these days), Jamaica, Belize, and Cuba.  GLBT is against the law in all these countries-- and in Belize, u'd even b denied entry into the country, since, as an identifiable trans person, u would be considered a gay man and as such not even eligible for entry under the law. Best bet for a safe vaca is the US, British, French and Dutch colonial islands (Virgins, Anguilla, Caymans, etc)--iow, places that at least have repealed their 19th century sodomy laws."

That said, it should be pretty easy, the actual physical effects of HRT are so gradual that people who see you often are unlikely to notice even on a 1 year time frame. Other physical changes such as growing out hair etc are also easy to cover. If you want a wardrobe, keep it at your friends. Just look at the one woman that started hrt over the internet at 14 and parents didn't catch on except by accident when she was 17. I think if anything once you start you'll find the hard thing is to keep pretending and not tell them."

At most you may need to switch to racerback Ts like underarmor which compress your chest slightly after a year or so.  I work in a VERY conservative environment and am very visible but I have never had any comments on:   HRT (coming up on a year) polished (as opposed to having polish on them) nails which are VERY neat threaded eyebrows shaving (have for years and years before I even recognized why) substantial female wardrobe items- Finn comfort clogs, trouser socks, conservatively cut female pants, jumpers super soft skin (HRT aftereffect- anyone touches you intimately they notice this instantly but it's not at all apparent for acquaintences) BB cream (I have dark eyes)   I am sure you're convinced I'm shitting you, I am not.  Never a batted eye and zero convo that I'm aware of and I'm kind of a butterfly, talking to everyone and no, nobody would presume I'm anything other than a straight, conservative engineer when, in fact, I'm literally none of those things.

Otherwise you'll probably be back home for break/holiday at some point and you can tell her then.  The reason I say this is that (guessing from your handle) you're an adult and coming out to your family is perpendicular to starting a medical transition if that's what you're planning to do - that decision is between you and your doctor alone, really.  And if you were to start HRT in September it wouldn't be like it was that obvious if you came home in October or November and delivered the news then; I didn't come out to my own family until a couple of months into HRT. Frankly, delivering it as ""this is a thing I've thought through and am doing"" vs. ""this is a thing I want to do"" might put them in a more accepting mindframe - that whole asking for forgiveness rather than permission thing :)"
asktransgender,3dih5i,leftoblique,2,Thu Jul 16 18:11:44 2015 UTC,"I'm still unsure if I'm going to do HRT yet. I'll be starting to see a therapist once I go back in August and the next time I'd be home would be in December but doing HRT could complicate my career, not just my family relationships. I'm mostly just tired of lying to them. I've been keeping the fact that I'm bi hidden from my family for almost 7 years and adding the realization that I'm trans on top of that is just too much to keep lying about."
asktransgender,3dih5i,leftoblique,2,Thu Jul 16 18:48:21 2015 UTC,"See that therapist! As for your career - may I ask what field? You don't have to answer if you don't want to or you think it would out you.  Anyway, if it's highly likely you're going to transition eventually then now might not be a terrible time. You're just starting your career (or grad school?) so everyone in your professional life would know you as your new gender and persona. And you're young enough that you'll get some of the extra benefits of starting HRT before about 25 (hips! decent boobs!) That goes doubly if you're suffering from any kind of hair loss - you'll head it off (pardon the pun) and probably even get some back.  Believe me - I'm not trying to push you. I don't recommend people transitioning if they're on the fence, and certainly not without seeing a therapist. But once you've made that decision and you know you're going to do it, there's almost always a benefit to sooner rather than later.  And again, like I said, unless your family's non-acceptance would be a legit reason to never transition, this is all perpendicular to how or when you tell them. You can always figure out how to do that later."

I also desperately want to transition but I worry that I'm never going to be beautiful. I was looking at some of the top posts on /r/transtimelines earlier today and it made me incredibly sad. I wish I had realized I was trans sooner so I could have had more of a chance to be the beautiful girl I want to be so much.  If I had my choice, I would have been born female. I could have spent my entire singing career learning to sing a girl's part and not have to worry about being stuck as a baritone with boobs.

I totally understand your concern with your career; I have the same hangups about singing as I'm a bass but you know what? I think people get used to it after a while, and I've heard there are things you can do to stretch your range. Maybe you'll just end up a contralto? :)  I also understand the wariness if you're looking to teach; schools in many places are really retrograde when it comes to LGBTQ people teaching. But not everywhere, and many locations have employment protections in place, especially for government employees (plus the recent EEOC rulings in the U.S. if you live here in the States).  Re the timelines stuff: stop it. Really, stop it. You're in way better shape than me timeline-wise and I turned out just fine - hell, I transitioned in my mid 30s! If you want to see what that looks like, you can find me under the same handle on Twitter. Yah, I'm not gonna win any beauty pageants but nobody can call me ugly.  And the fact is this: most women aren't ""beautiful"". Most women are just women. They struggle with body image, weight, etc. I'm comfortable in my own skin now but I still have body issues - they're the same body issues as every other gal I know. If you take care of yourself, learn to dress to flatter your figure and do decent makeup, you can probably pull off ""nice"" or ""pretty"" a lot of the time. And maybe when you're all dolled up you can be ""beautiful"" once and a while but shit, that's a lot of work, and completely out of the realm of possibility for most people.  You feel like you'll never be beautiful? Go to Wal-Mart and look at the people there. Don't take your cues from TV and movies on how women are supposed to look; look at the actual women in the world around you. Lemme tell you - getting a realistic view of the American woman is a huge ego boost sometimes :)  Last bit of advice: if you do transition and you're not happy with how you look, find a good plastic surgeon. Seriously. Take a few years to save up and go see somebody like Dr. Z in Chicago; he'll fix you right up :)"

asktransgender,3dih5i,OrangeLaceChair,2,Fri Jul 17 16:46:22 2015 UTC,"First, congrats! I'm sure it's taken a huge burden off your shoulders.  Second, let's face it: those of us who've gone through the wrong puberty have bone structure which isn't always conducive to looking ultra-feminine. But HRT does amazing things, especially for younger folks. Combined with facial hair removal, good contouring, and the right hairstyle, you can make even a pretty rough face look decent. And like I said, if you're completely displeased, pick your least favorite feature and pay a surgeon to shave it off :)  I say don't give up hope, and certainly don't give up hope until you've been on HRT for at least a couple of years.  Next, as a vocal musician, you have all the tools in your arsenal already! You understand how your vocal tract works better than most of the people who do this, and you probably have more than enough control and range to pull it off. There are some great vocal training videos on YouTube, but lemme boil it down:   You want a pitch center (i.e. home note) at least F#3 (180 Hz) and if possible closer to A3 (220 Hz). You can use a tuner for that. You want to have a small vocal aperture, the opposite of singing. When you sing, you open up your throat, drop your larynx, retract your tongue root, and pull up your soft palate; when doing a feminine voice you want to move your tongue root forward, keep the space in your mouth small, and raise your larynx. You want to prefer crisp articulation. You want to use prosody (up/down pitch) for emphasis instead of volume; think sing-song instead of punchy. You want to stay slightly on the breathy side if possible.   The first two are especially important to overcome the thicker vocal cords and larger resonant space possessed by AMAB people who've gone through puberty. Pitch and resonance are the main ways people tell male from female voice. But if you can't get them perfectly (and most of us can't) then style of speech and your own appearance will make up for a lot of it.  Finally, do some combination of listening to recordings of cis women, and recording yourself and listening back. It's hard to hear yourself sometimes, but it's a great way to learn.  You can do this!

I always attributed this to a psychological phenomenon where straight individuals tend to be most attracted to those who look like opposite gender versions of them, so for me finding such similarities meant ""we were meant to be"" haha. But now I'm worried if this actually means what I am afraid of. :(  I also remember jamming out to songs sang by males and really feeling ""empowered"", I guess? I know that lots  cis-men love listening to and relating to Taylor Swift songs, and that lots of women do the same with other male artists, but it still worries me.  I'm just puzzled by the whole thing since I remember times when my girl friends would mention wishing how they were boys, and me thinking, ""Huh, really? Why would you want that?""  EDIT: Now I keep having intrusive thoughts saying, ""You hate being a girl"". It makes me nauseous. :("
asktransgender,3djsvz,fnsldfilsnaf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:25:43 2015 UTC,"wanted to have traits that resemble those of men in power, such as being ambitious, or having a dominating presence   It's not misogyny, it's wanting to be in a position of power for a change when being a woman can feel so oppressive. That's perfectly natural.  Your crushes are just crushes - you are allowed to find whatever you want attractive and there doesn't have to be a deep psychological reason. I like small breasts. My mother has small breasts. I don't worry that I secretly want to sleep with my mother - it's just that I find them cute and sexy. No big deal. Same with your similarity thing.  Most music has male lead vocals - identifying with a song is not just about the words, but also about liking the sound of it all. Humans tend to find lower voices pleasing - Barry White is synonymous with sex music. Higher pitch voices are more likely to annoy us - an evolutionary advantage we developed so that crying infants would immediately get attention, bettering their odds of survival.   You can't understand why someone would want to be a boy, so you don't want to be one. You might be unhappy about being a girl, BUT that doesn't mean the reason is being trans. It could have a lot to do with the way you perceive social and economic inequalities as well as being unhappy with some stark realities of sex related issues like menses, pregnancy, menopause, all of which men get a free pass for. Not to mention short restroom lines."
asktransgender,3djsvz,summer_d,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:41:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I just have one last question, I remember feeling kind of scared and not wanting breasts to grow during the onset of puberty, but eventually I grew to feel normal about them and even like them. I feel like those initial feelings came about because it meant I had to grow up (and sudden major bodily changes can be scary I guess), and obviously being a ""grown-up"" did not look fun to me. I have read that such feelings could be indication of being transgender. Should I be worried about this, or is it possible that I'm overanalyzing?"
asktransgender,3djsvz,fnsldfilsnal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:18:09 2015 UTC,"Not at all.  3 out of 4 of my most current girlfriends didn't want breasts when they started to come.  4 out of 4 didn't want their periods.  2 out of 4 didn't want to shave their legs.  It's perfectly natural for a variety of reasons.  All of your feelings have been perfectly natural, except the fear that you might be transgender.  I would not in your case be comfortable putting you on the trans spectrum.  I think you're just an unfortunate victim of your OCD.  And I think if you did try to transition, you'd eventually find out that you weren't meant to and go back to being a girl.  You like being a girl about as much as any girl I know."
asktransgender,3djsvz,summer_d,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:08:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much. I just get really scared when I read stories about people who discovered they were trans later in life. Like some people who thought it was just an obsession but it turned out to be true. Or even people who felt fine about their assigned gender until something like feeling like they don't fit in with others brought it about. I just never thought it was possible to go from cis (like from having a strong, secure sense of one's birth gender during childhood) to trans later in life (and vice-versa)!"
asktransgender,3djsvz,fnsldfilsna1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:20:31 2015 UTC,"I'm 34 now and ""discovered"" it only months ago, but at least for me, there were always signs - really big, neon-type signs - and I was just ignoring them or trying to explain them away as something less than what they were.  I can't say with certainty that it's the same for everyone, but I suspect that most late-bloomers have some sort of idea at various points in their lives, it's just that they push it away until it overpowers them.  Some people think it's something sexual mostly because they don't even know there's a word for how they feel.  I really, honestly think that you don't fit that, and I feel like if you were to start trying to live like a man it would probably just make you feel really awful - you'd be forcing onto yourself the same gender dysphoria that most trans people are trying to escape by transitioning.  I do think it would be good for you to speak with a therapist about your feelings, though, because there are people who are qualified to teach you how to let go of these persistent thoughts when they take over, or to at least acknowledge them and move on without being distressed.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Mindfulness have helped a lot of people manage their daily lives easier through various techniques that help them learn to separate their thoughts from their sense of self, so that thoughts they have that are negative can be viewed objectively, without feeling like they are necessarily part of a person.    I really wish you good luck with all of this.  You sound like a very sweet girl who definitely doesn't deserve to be putting herself through this whirlwind of emotions.  Stay safe."

I can honestly say now that my anxiety has decreased exponentially, and that the thoughts are really just starting to look like nothing more than...just thoughts randomly pop up in my brain (like they do in everyone else's). I know I keep being annoying with the questions, but does occasionally thinking it would be interesting/cool to live as something you're not mean you actually want to live that way? I can also recall always feeling more serious or mature compared to my girl friends, and I also find gay male erotica more fascinating than straight. I also remember dealing with inferiority complex issues related to my ethnicity (being non-white), how I sort of momentarily thought once that I wanted (or thought it'd be better) to be born a white man so I wouldn't have to deal with racism AND sexism. Now that I got over issues with my ethnicity, I am totally happy with being a woman (and was ultimately happy with it even while I was dealing with those problems). But now my brain is making these things feel like 'evidence'. I really hate this fear of dysphoria (which I hope means I'm not?). :("

asktransgender,3djsvz,fnsldfilsnap,2,Mon Jul 20 16:47:14 2015 UTC,"Really sounds more like OCD to me, with intrusive thoughts about what if you might be trans.  Everything you say indicates you feel female, enjoy being female, and have been distressed at the thought of people seeing you as male.  Yet, you can't stop worrying about ""what if"".  There's nothing there that sounds like you're actually a trans man.  If you were trans, you'd want people to see you as male.  My entire life I had a secret sense of pleasure when someone used the ""wrong"" pronoun for me, or forgot that I was there when addressing an entire room of guys and included me in there, or when someone mistook me for male in a video game.   If those kinds of things don't make you feel happy, you're probably not trans."
asktransgender,3djsvz,amadeoamante,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:02:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response! I logically know in my heart of hearts that I am female, but ever since these thoughts popped up I just feel less...feminine and more ""masculine"", and because of that I feel like I am losing myself and incredibly distressed. I guess you can say that the intrusive thoughts have led to these weird intrusive feelings that create intense anxiety and a sense of doom (which I have seen is a definite symptom of OCD), and I really don't want them. You are definitely right about the constant ""what if's""."
asktransgender,3djsvz,fnsldfilsnaf,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:58:50 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a job for a therapist.  Do you have someone you see for your OCD?  Keep in mind though, there are tons of things that are stereotypically ""masculine"" that you might be wanting to explore.  That doesn't make you a guy.  It just means you might want to develop as a person, do some new things, give yourself that opportunity to do things you might not have done before because of gender roles.  That's okay.  It's normal to want to experiment with that.  Just because you enjoy something like being in control of a situation, or being able to work with your hands, or whatever... that absolutely does NOT mean you ought to be a guy.  Girls can do that stuff too. :)"
asktransgender,3djsvz,amadeoamante,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:08:36 2015 UTC,"The only stereotypically masculine activity I like doing doing a probably video games, haha. But even then there was a phase where I would pride myself in being a girl gamer (which I now realize is kinda stupid, but that's a whole 'nother subject). I do like the idea of having a dominating presence though, but in a ""power woman"" way.  I guess I really need to just accept that brains conjure up all sorts of thoughts that do not necessarily mean anything.  P.S. I know this is sort of ridiculous, but is enjoying singing along with male songs a sign?"
asktransgender,3djsvz,fnsldfilsnaf,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:14:52 2015 UTC,"Nope, not a sign. :)  You can pretend to be a singer, an actor, a superhero, etc. to without wanting to actually be a guy.  Hell, I play video games as female characters now that I'm transitioned, because I'm a guy now so pretending to be a female doesn't threaten my identity.  It's just pretend.  Or if you're feeling empathetic with whatever they're singing about, you can have empathy for someone without wanting to be their gender.  All of us have the ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes, even if they're different from us."
asktransgender,3djsvz,amadeoamante,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:22:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I really hope that nothing I said was offensive. I actually was also worried if the fact that I liked playing male characters in imaginary games sometimes (although that was probably like <5% of the time) meant that I had hidden desires to be an man! It's even weirder because in the end of the day, when I'm not OCD'ing, I'm totally happy and love being female."
asktransgender,3djsvz,fnsldfilsnaf,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:35:56 2015 UTC,"Not offensive at all, I'm pretty hard to offend.  The key thing to remember is that if you love being female, you're not trans.  A trans guy would either hate being female, and never love it, or want really really strongly to be a guy, and just be ""meh"" about having a female body-- he wouldn't love it or be happy about it.  So I don't think you need to be worried about that. :)  Now, how to keep yourself from repeatedly thinking about it... that I'm not sure.  I have really mild OCD myself, but it's things like checking door locks and ovens, and making sure all the cats are where they should be (ie not in the dishwasher, washing machine, or oven) lol.  For me once I've checked twice I can usually shut my brain up.  So I don't have much experience with the really repetitive stuff."

It definitely takes practice, but it makes the whole situation a lot more bearable. The thing with OCD is that it takes the smallest thing and blows it wayyy out of proportion by turning it into ""evidence""."

I promise this is my last question haha: I have admired and liked the androgynous look before, but in sort of a fashion sense (as an aesthetic), rather than in an identity way. I understand that androgyny falls under the trans umbrella, but I thought that was only in terms of gender identity and not in terms of just fashion or aesthetics. Would this be a sign, or is liking the androgynous look (aesthetically) different from being trans? In the end of the day though, I still love to be female and want to live as one.  In other words, can a cis person dress in an androgynous fashion, and still be cis?"
asktransgender,3djsvz,Scarecrow_gunter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:50 2015 UTC,"Gonna say what the common response to this type of question is; do you actually feel or have the desire to be seen or addressed as a male? Do you feel the desire to be or often act in a more masculine fashion than your peers? If no then you are probably just stressing for now and I wouldn't worry unless the feelings persist.  If you still need more, here is how I know for myself and maybe it will give you a better reference to your own feelings.  I'm MtF myself soon to start HRT, and since I've come out to both myself and friends and some family I have found an incredible diminishing of stress and anxiety and feelings of joy and being estatic when referred to by female name and pronouns and when dressing ib feminine clothes like dresses. The most noticeable difference is I can't smile when hiding in dude mode that is my key point to being certain of my choice to transition."
asktransgender,3djsvz,Vathoska,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:29:23 2015 UTC,"I'd have to say 'no' to all of those questions. Actually, with regards to being addressed as a male, I remember being mad at my parents when I was younger for giving me a name that in my opinion, isn't very feminine.   I really hope that it's just OCD. I really can't stand the intrusive any more though. I do notice that the feelings tend to greatly diminish when I am occupied with something else though or not worried about this."
asktransgender,3djsvz,Melian9,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:37:51 2015 UTC,"Understandable, I wouldn't rush to dismiss it but I wouldn't rush to make a decision either.

You could be in denial I guess though; it's very common for example for trans women to grow huge beards and hit the gym hard, or inversely for trans men to be big into fashion / makeup, before the moment of realisation as a form of overcompensation. There's nothing wrong with breaking gender roles if you think that might make you happy, even if you don't want to transition quite yet or ever!"

asktransgender,3djsvz,batshiatbadger,2,Thu Jul 16 22:48:51 2015 UTC,"It doesn't mean anything except that you like to visualize certain things during fantasy, and that's okay.

I understand that some people may overcompensate, but I never recall feeling any sort of dissonance. I really just lived my life the way I wanted to."
asktransgender,3djsvz,batshiatbadger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:44:47 2015 UTC,"I definitely went through a shortish (2-3 years) period of denial. Luckily, if in three years you realise you're actually trans, the only thing that's happened is that three years have passed. Especially for FtM HRT isn't very time-sensitive. A lot of people see those three years as wasted, but they're only wasted if you spend them wallowing in depression and misery like I did. My best advice for you is to embrace who you are and live your life, don't let these doubts or intrusive thoughts get in your way.   The thing about denial is that once you start questioning yourself seriously the illusion you created usually falls apart pretty fast. That doesn't seem to have happened to you. Remember that nobody conforms 100 percent or even 70 percent to gender stereotypes and norms, so thinking up random examples from your youth of times you ""acted male"" doesn't help much, especially when the overwhelming number of anecdotes you've brought out here show the opposite.  Questioning yourself is rough, and it can really get to you. If it's very bad you should definitely consider talking to a medical professional, both about this and about any potential OCD. I don't know where you live, so it might not be covered by insurance or your countrys healthcare plan."

Instead of asking why am I trans or why do I think this way.  Ask what do I want?  Do I want to live as the other gender?  Do I not want to live as any gender? Do I want to live as my birth gender?  These are answerable questions.  The why is irrelevant.  All that matters is finding out how you want to be and be treated.

I just spent a week w/ my best friend though (he lives out of state) and it's easy to slip into my old voice when I'm with old friends.   Presentation goes a long way in subconsciously speaking more feminine, though, because when I feel good about how I look it just comes out more naturally. I think the same is true for the way you carry yourself etc."

Around total strangers its full female voice, and its easier to do with strangers for whatever reason, I guess because they dont have history."

asktransgender,3dkelc,pawxy,3,Fri Jul 17 04:27:34 2015 UTC,"There arent any at home blood tests for hormones that im aware of. People started looking at me funny at 8 months. By a year and a half the rumor mill was im full force at school. By year three everyone thought i was: gay, a crossdresser, a girl dressing like a boy, or (this was the rumor) that i was both male and female.   The costs were about 120 bucks a month which was basically all the money i made working at my dads store after school. I could make more in the summer and if i was able to sell anything."
asktransgender,3dkelc,samsonthedog2003,2,Fri Jul 17 04:32:21 2015 UTC,I saw this- http://www.privatemdlabs.com/lp/Female_Hormone_Testing.php but I may be wrong about what it is. And wow $120. Can you get it cheaper if you buy in bulk? I have a job but its part time minimum wage so im not making much. Also okay thats good I guess. I plan on comings out my senior year which is a year away so I guess the timeframe lines up pretty well. Oh and if that blood test isn't what I think then what did you do for blood test??

asktransgender,3dlby2,LiquidyToast,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:01:59 2015 UTC,"For legs, chest, and stomach waxing would be a good idea. Also once you get it short nair seems to work well for me, but then again I wasn't very hairy to begin with. Either way that would probably help with the maintenance. It will thin out and grow in slower once you start HRT.  Also just to add I also use dollar shave club and their razors are $6 a month for 4 cartridges and you have the option of adding more. Much cheaper then buying them from the store."
asktransgender,3dlby2,whereitstarts,2,Fri Jul 17 05:25:41 2015 UTC,"I will second Dollar shave club actually. Both my wife and I use them, we go through about 4 razors a month in total between the two of us. the razors are good quality and stay sharp (we could use them for longer but opt not to due to them sitting in the shower all the time). The only issue with Dollar Shave club razors is the distance between the blades is pretty narrow so it gets clogged really easily, especially when you are starting. It just means you have to rinse every 6 inches or so. once you are on a maintenance shave schedule it is great."
asktransgender,3dlby2,Rebecca98105,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:41:17 2015 UTC,I've been pretty happy with them. Been using them for about 8mo. Although I haven't noticed the clogging part though. I do have a high pressure shower head and thin body hair so that might be the reason. On the occasion that they do get clogged a good clack to the bathtub usually sets it straight :P
asktransgender,3dlby2,whereitstarts,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:49:06 2015 UTC,"Waxing is probably your best bet.

asktransgender,3dlby2,RevengeOfSalmacis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:52:01 2015 UTC,"If you're capable of extreme care (because otherwise you will cut yourself) and aren't a self harm risk for the foreseeable future, then safety razors are super cheap. $30 will get you a decent handle, and you can buy blades in bulk for pennies each. Be sure to use a good shaving cream or gel and zero pressure. Hrt should help thin out body hair over time, but plenty of women are still pretty hairy, so you may need to do hair removal for a long while."
asktransgender,3dilkg,M995,6,Thu Jul 16 15:51:18 2015 UTC,"Everyone who's aware of social issues is a bit frustrated with men, I'm a gay man and I'll agree with generalizing comments like that.  But I don't think I'm a horrible person, and it sounds to me like you have a self-hatred problem that's not caused by what people have said about men and male privelege. In general it's always my opinion you should stop double- and triple- checking and doubting whether you're really trans and not just mistaken (as therapists and psychological literature and society's opinion have no doubt taught you is absolutely necessary) and go with the option which clearly makes you happier.  Viewing being trans as something which must be able to minutely prove and justify against constant doubt, while not having to defend ""not being trans"" in the same way, is not a fair approach."
asktransgender,3dilkg,Volande,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:31:10 2015 UTC,"Hi. Thanks for the response. I hope you don't mind me asking but are you trans yourself? I think I am because I feel happy at the idea of being viewed as a woman and not as a feminine man. The latter just doesn't sit right. Also, when my dysphoria is not so bad I really like how I look in my outfits. So, it seems like my trans feelings are a result of actual dysphoria and not guilt.  Also, I don't blame people being fed up with the majority of men and being wary of them. I just take shit not applicable to me and apply it to me, it's not healthy. Hopefully I can just learn to sort out my gender issues and learn to love myself."
asktransgender,3dilkg,KateGlass,5,Thu Jul 16 17:11:50 2015 UTC,"So from what i gather here, you say that your feelings mainly occur when you see statements like    ""Men are x bad thing"", ""i hate men"", etc...   When you hear this you start to feel bad. This sounds like its because you feel the statements are aimed at your views of yourself and your gender role.. so stop and take a step back. When you hear this base  your view of yourself not on your gender or feelings towards gender but your actions.    Do you taunt people in the street, do you start fights are you an anti social lout?  My guess here is no. So thats what you have to focus on. I think when you say your friends and they say you are a good person, this is because they are gauging you based on these actions and interactions that they see.  You Also Say   I'm worried it will mean people will say it will make my being transgender not valid? But wouldn't that be a good thing, as life will be easier? I don't even know anymore, to be honest   Right now it sounds like your living in a mostly closeted role, so your views are not going to invalidate your trans status, as your questioning.. and thats going to bring up all sorts of mental gymnastics that you have to work through.   As for would it be not be easier? Transitioning is not easy, sorry but it really isn't. I dont say this to scare you off, i say it in honesty. If you do however decided thats right for you then you will develop a newfound strength and confidence.. it takes time.. but the old phrase ' it gets easier/better' is actually very true (for most)  but its a journey.. and as with everything there are up's and downs.   I love wearing dresses/make up and stuff and being referred to as Melissa makes me happy sometimes but honestly I don't know if it's for the right reasons.   Without being able to digg into your brain and find out for you, only you will know whats right. What i will say though is that its always worth remebering .. its a spectrum.. you could be anywhere on that.. so this might not even be straight up 100% binary trans woman.. i know i wasn't 100% sure when i started my discovery.. i had doubts.. but the more i explored and experimented and questioned myself and answered honestly the more clear the answer came to me and got me to where i am with my journey so far."

asktransgender,3dilkg,burnsbabe,3,Thu Jul 16 17:14:10 2015 UTC,"I think it's mostly important to realize that if you continue to work hard to address areas where you have unacknowledged privilege and you continue to work to act as a true ally to those who are part of oppressed groups that you yourself don't belong to, then you're fine.  As far as the generic ""men suck"" thoughts, first, you're not a man. Second, everyone understands that that doesn't literally apply to every man on the planet but that's getting into dangerously unhelpful #notallmen territory so it does very little good.  Stay vigilant that you're not part of the problem, acknowledge ways you could be better, and work on them. Don't talk over the lived experiences of other groups (I doubt you love it when cis people do that to us, right?) and do your best to uplift efforts by others rather than making it about you.  If you do this, you're already far and above most. If this is where the self-hatred is coming from then you should be good. If it's more like internalized transphobia, that's a whole 'nother ball of wax."
asktransgender,3dilkg,hoping4rein,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:23:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I found this very informative. Yeah, you're right about the all men remarks, sorry if I was being a jerk.  I tend to already do most of these things you mentioned and I try to make sure I'm not being rude/ignorant. I think it's very possible it is internalized transphobia, is it cool if you could leave advice? Thanks :)"
asktransgender,3dilkg,southerlywind,3,Thu Jul 16 19:20:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah. You weren't being a jerk. I'm just pointing out that it's a trap that a lot of people fall into. You're perfectly within your rights as a trans person and a woman to feel like ""all men suck"" or ""fuck cis people"" or whatever, just as people of color are being perfectly reasonable when they say something like ""white people just steal from us"".  As far as internalized transphobia, I don't have a lot of good advice that's of immediate use. It's unfortunately a slow process to unlearn that. Spend time focusing on things you like about yourself (as a woman and trans person especially). Make friends with other trans people so you can hold each other up and accountable whenever one of you feels like that. Hearing ""No, you're pretty"" or ""I promise you look good"" or ""You're worth it, really"" from someplace other than your own head helps a lot."
asktransgender,3dilkg,southerlywind,2,Thu Jul 16 20:45:17 2015 UTC,"First of all, women are just as prone to being awful people as men. It's usually just in different ways.    Secondly, ask yourself why being a good person matters to you. Maybe you're religious, in which case it's an easy question to answer. If not, you should be aware that it really isn't its own reward and most people can't recognize it enough to give you credit without outward displays like volunteering at a soup kitchen or joining the peace corps. So find out what it means to you and whether or not it's worth it and, more importantly, whether or not you can help it. If it's simply in your nature to want to be what you define as good, then how does that merit self respect? It's a big topic and how willing you are to dive into the depths will reveal whether you want to be a good person rather than just feel like a good person(like most who adopt the title).    Thirdly, if you still decide you want to be a good person, the best thing you can do is become more self aware. Do things in spite of your feelings, play devil's advocate, anything to get yourself out of the autopilot that most people spend their lives in. If a belief ""feels"" good, it should become suspect. Remove as many potential ulterior motives as you can from your belief system, especially beliefs concerning who you are as a person. But prepare to possibly be unhappy. It's hard to keep your eyes wide open without seeing everything that makes others so ego driven and animalistic and how, why and where behaviors that most see as petty are actually having a negative affect.    Finally, realize that whatever your goal, it's what you define it as based on your personal capabilities. It takes a level of emotional intelligence and analytical stubbornness to shoot straight for the heart of your own cognitive biases and some are simply born more capable of this than others. If a person simply doesn't have the capacity to juggle all of the ins and outs of the many ethical implications of each little action(which nobody can do perfectly), then trying their best with what they have makes them just as good of a person as anyone else who uses what they have to the same degree, regardless of how much more or less capable they are than others. So remember that being able to meet people where they are at is part of all this. This goes for everything I've written here as well. It's my own perspective, based on my own level of abilities, which makes the previous paragraph something you shouldn't have to agree with.    If this is all too messy and complicated then just distract yourself, have fun, stop thinking so much and find comfort in the idea that none of this really matters so you shouldn't beat yourself up over expectations you can't even find a justification for."

asktransgender,3dilkg,ZelkyZo,3,Thu Jul 16 15:58:07 2015 UTC,"(TW: transphobia (?)) I've been confused by trying to separate out disgust for maleness, and a real desire to be a woman. I think in our society there is a problem with masculinity, so being conscious of that would probably prompt a lot of reflection. Do I just want to escape responsibility and guilt? Do I just want to wear a sexist costume of a woman? I'm sorry if these questions are bad, but they're real ones I've had in my own head and they're not going away.  And in general questioning my motives in that way. Is that similar to your experience?  Sometimes I think I see becoming a woman as an escape from a toxic world, somehow. And sometimes I think I just want to be non male, wherever else I land doesn't matter. I don't know why my ideas and feelings towards gender are the way they are, but they're there regardless. I feel trapped, and then I feel guilty for saying that, considering how privileged I am."
asktransgender,3dilkg,Amberhawke6242,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:31:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can relate to a fair bit of this. I think we just need to think of this rationally.   If we transition based off of worrying we'll be horrible because we'll be guys then we'll be transitioning for a bad reason. We won't be happy living a gender we actually aren't. Their are plenty of men who are decent and not very masculine. People that transition to male don't automatically become bad or anything so a transition isn't the key to being a better person.  Or we could be transitioning because we just know we're not the gender assigned to us at birth. I think the idea of a ""sexist costume"" strays way too close to terf shit to be honest (not having a go, just saying it's probably not the best idea to consider stuff like that). It could just simply be we are uneasy about our assigned gender identities because we just simply aren't them!  I hope this helps. I think we just need to be kinder to ourselves. We all deserve love and respect, regardless of our gender :)"

Expressing your feminine side without shoving it in people's faces, just ""being feminine"" wherever you go. People will figure it out for themselves and see the improvement but not know the cause.  As each friend or relative acknowledges the changes then you can inform them of how and why they came about.

I was taught by a cis-female who learned a lot on her own, but also from /r/MakeUpAddiction and some other ones on here. Phenomenal, albeit sometimes bitchy places.  But back on track, so when we say of matte, wet. We mean the same thing as we would with an acrylic or a spray paint or a simple paint. You get a oil based paint, put on a clear coat for protection, and boom, ya choose matte for a non reflective, semi-opaque finish, a wet/glossy look there.  Of course ya scuff the boards a bit for grip into the wood when painting the base coat, and a primer would obviously help too.  Youtube some videos, if you can't, I can give ya a text/picture rough based guideline to get started.  Remember, the difference in makeup is not only Maybellin/Nars (lower end/ Higher end), but also in the use of a PRIMER!  Think house painting and a lot of this makes sense.  EDIT sorry, by metaphot got mixed in there too much. Basically if you've ever scuffed up wood, laid base coats, and a clear sealing coat, ya know how to paint your nails. Just pigment and a setter liquified by a quick evaporating solvent like Acetone."

I was mainly pressured into thinking that I had to be strong, muscular, and stoic, which I am very much to opposite of. Other things were things like being forced to do sports like soccer and baseball(though I know that plenty of people have had to go through this) even though I didn't like them(thought I have an aversion to social interaction no matter what it is). I was also pretty much taught to not be anything but a male(It took a LONG time for me to get the guts to even create a female character in a video game, and even then I still don't if I know I won't get a lot of privacy, such as playing RPGs on a console) because that was ""wrong"".

asktransgender,3dkdr0,AWhiteKnight123,3,Thu Jul 16 23:48:54 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't come out if I were you, not yet anyways. Usually if someone is against homosexuality/bisexuality/anything they consider abnormal, they'll be against transgenderism as well. In these cases, it's generally best to stay closeted until you're in charge of yourself and you don't have to convince people about who you are. I'd say wait until you can move out. I really wish I had."
asktransgender,3dkdr0,transandpans,2,Fri Jul 17 00:05:51 2015 UTC,"This might as well have been me like.. a year ago? Almost two years?! :o  Honestly, I don't have a happy success story to tell. My parents rejected my coming out.  That doesn't tell you how yours will react, though, and it doesn't change your reality- if you firmly believe this, and you want to take action on it, you have little choice but to come out to your parents. At your age, you'll need their support and blessing for nearly anything relating to transition, awkward as that might make things. So, I'd recommend getting in a good place mentally, and doing it. Fallout can be dealt with, getting the words out is the hardest step to take, because you have to motivate yourself entirely.  It's so scary to do, but you'll survive. Be prepared- have backup plans to sleep at a friend's for one or two nights, be ready for them to be angry, upset, or hurtful. But also be prepared for them to be supportive, and even feel guilty or ashamed they didn't like.. make things easier for you. People react unpredictably.  If you want to just talk, or ask advice, or anything, my inbox is always open :)"

That was enough for me to grit my teeth and deal with the fear. Maybe you can find motivation similarly?  I'm sorry for where you're at. It's such a hard stage of life, in my opinion.

My company has been very supportive and there have been no issues. Even now, I don't have my name change legally completed and all forms of ID still say male. Yet, I was allowed to use the women's room without hesitation. (This is Chicago for anyone that cares.)  My first day was terrifying. I had already come out and told each of my coworkers that I saw on a daily basis that I would be transitioning and Monday I would be back as Holly. They were supportive, albeit confused. So when I walked in that morning, nothing bad happened, but I still was in freak-out mode. I almost quit and went home a dozen times.   About mid way through the day, I had a meeting with all my coworkers and my CEO. My CEO started the meeting by saying, ""Since it's now official, I want to make sure everyone knows Holly has my full support and if there are any issues with her transition, they can be brought to me. That short statement made everything OK and I've never worried since.  The big things that mattered to me were bathrooms, email address, and ID badge. They were all simple things, but they made the process manageable and smooth."

asktransgender,3dihcp,my_throwaway6,3,Thu Jul 16 15:19:58 2015 UTC,"I started going to a counselor at my previous university earlier this year. I was going to a pretty conservative university in the south (which is rated one of the worst for LGBT students in the nation) so I was super nervous to say the least. My counselor ended up being an awesome ally and even though she didn't know a lot about gender issues, just having a non-judgmental listener to talk at really helped me figure out a lot. She also set me up with a lot of resources and referrals for gender therapists when I asked for them.  My advice? Sign up, gauge how you feel about just taking that step, you can even cancel the appointment if you want. Remember that everything you say is confidential, and if you hate the experience then you aren't under any obligation to go back or see the counselor again. Regardless of whether you are decide that you are transgender or not, dealing with these kinds of questions by yourself without anyone to talk to is confusing, lonely, and really hard."
asktransgender,3dihcp,jenrawr,3,Thu Jul 16 17:54:42 2015 UTC,"My college's health center offers free walk in counseling. I went a few times before actually signing in because I was extremely anxious about it. When I finally made it all the way to the sign-in desk, I was simply asked if it was my first time there. Since it was, I was asked to go through a questionnaire on a computer in a private area. All the questions were of the ""check all the apply"" or drop-down list type. It covered topics like: family matters, drug/alcohol habits, mood/emotional history, sexual/gender identity, etc. I was able to just pick from a list to say what was bothering me. Gender was a very small section and not the only thing that applied to me.   Right after the questionnaire, I spent 30 minutes with a counselor and got an appointment set with a university therapist that was trans* informed. It was just one thing after another after that as far as connecting with support and taking transition steps goes."

She asked for my preferred name and pronouns. Then we talked about my dysphoria for a bit and my plans regarding transition. Then I was put on a wait list for a therapist. While I was on the wait list I received a weekly call to check up on me. A few weeks later I got a call saying that a spot had opened up for me with a therapist they had just hired. I met up with him, and while he didn't have any experience with trans people, he was respectful and understanding with a willingness to learn. After a few weeks, he told me he had talked to his supervisor and they were both comfortable writing my letter of recommendation for hormones."

asktransgender,3di3d5,Barely-Boobage,3,Thu Jul 16 14:52:18 2015 UTC,I think if you get full night of sleep you release more human growth hormone. Those make your hrt much more effective
asktransgender,3di3d5,WorldWideWeb1994,0,Thu Jul 16 15:17:38 2015 UTC,"Growth hormone secretion peaks right after falling asleep and falls back to the baseline. Waking up intermittently and then going back to sleep (not healthy) will cause more growth hormone secretion than a night of continuous sleep.  Also, the secretion of growth hormone during sleep is more significant for adults. If puberty is still ongoing, or you've just finished puberty, it's likely to be less significant."

The only issue is that we as a society won't reach that singularity in our life time. Not only that but humans are naturally social animals, meaning we want to interact with other people in different ways, and every small instance of socialization is meaningful however small.   Why? Because when you step out of the house and can't feel comfortable with yourself then can you do that for 85+ years?   Jeez, this also makes no sense, but i'll leave it up.

asktransgender,3djfkp,qctran,4,Thu Jul 16 19:49:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's even more than that.  Some people want a more feminine or masculine presentation beyond just clothes, makeup, etc.  Even if/when those words fade to mean nothing, people will still have preferences and tastes, and along with scientific advancements the ability to better accommodate those personal styles completely.  Society might become perfectly okay with extremely feminine ""men"" who present totally as what we would stereotypically define as female, but that doesn't mean all or even most trans women or for that matter trans men will be personally content with forgoing physical transition.  Even under the circumstances the OP states, many of us including myself would still undergo transition.  For many MtFs, it's not enough to simply do ""feminine"" things even if it were perfectly acceptable and never questioned.  The physical transition isn't just something we do to blend into our society as it exists today.  Many trans women want to be able to get pregnant for example."

The overwhelming majority of people seem to be happy with the ways that presentation signal gender identity. That will change somewhat as deviation becomes more acceptable, but I don't think it will go away entirely.  The styles of clothing / behavior we see are probably mostly learned as gender specific expressions. But that association becomes very ingrained and internalized. I think it's satisfying / comforting when one expresses the signals that feel like the right gender. At least, that's the most sense of this I can make based on my own experience.  For reference, for most of my life, I was only aware of my dysphoria as the sense of wanting a female body. I never had any temptation to cross dress or otherwise express myself in a way I understood to be feminine. When I finally understood my gender identity and began transition, suddenly it felt compelling to adopt what I interpret as feminine mannerisms and dress. It's puzzling to me, but the above is how I best understand it."

asktransgender,3djcbj,sheplaysbass,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:28:28 2015 UTC,It is definitely a good thing when it comes to standard stuff.   But when you want to transition all they want to do is safe the money. It is still kinda trated as a mental illness (At least so they pay)  But they send you there and there to make sure it is really the right thing. That comes for HRT and the again when it comes to SRS.   I also have to get every single prescription for my hormones approved by my healtcare provider. Thats a real hassle.
asktransgender,3djcbj,sheplaysbass,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:38:27 2015 UTC,Yeah. I never dismiss different ways of accomplishing a goal. But I do recognize when things are over complicated for a less than appropriate reason.
asktransgender,3dhp4v,transthrowaway1931,20,Thu Jul 16 10:42:20 2015 UTC,"You two don't make any impulsive decisions, now. It doesn't sound like you're consumed by jealousy and it doesn't sound like she's looking for an out. What it does sound like is that you have a really stable, loving relationship that both of you really want to be in right now. So keep enjoying each other - shit happens and you can work it out."
asktransgender,3dhp4v,UniversalPolymath,17,Thu Jul 16 12:52:56 2015 UTC,There's seriously no reason to break up. Your girlfriend experienced unwanted advances and cut it off.
asktransgender,3dhp4v,Hagot,2,Thu Jul 16 12:45:12 2015 UTC,If they made out for a long time. That is different. That's nothing.
asktransgender,3dhp4v,starbuxed,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:25:04 2015 UTC,"Sorry but kissing for 5 seconds is not cutting it off, that's enjoying it and then regretting it afterwards."
asktransgender,3dhp4v,CheckeredDots,-2,Thu Jul 16 16:02:43 2015 UTC,"Unwanted advances aren't kisses that last for five seconds.  OP, I think you might get better advice if you head over to /r/relationships"
asktransgender,3dhp4v,AndromedaPrincess,5,Thu Jul 16 13:28:54 2015 UTC,"um, five seconds is a pretty short amount of time, especially if it came as a surprise and one is shocked by it. it's just a kiss, one that didn't mean anything to her."
asktransgender,3dhp4v,la-grande-eponge,0,Thu Jul 16 14:35:37 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree, I suppose we all have different standards for our relationships."
asktransgender,3dhp4v,AndromedaPrincess,11,Thu Jul 16 14:45:12 2015 UTC,"Like hagot said, there's really no need to overreact and call things off. Let's go through this again, calmly.  GF is kissed by person A. No idea why exactly, probably because she's attractive and A thought she had a chance. GF immediately puts a stop to this, explains that she's with OP and tat she doesn't want any of this.  A short summary: GF is loyal and in love with OP. A failed her quest but at least got a kiss out of it.  GF gets back to OP, tells them about the events that occurred. OP is shocked but seemingly okay with the situation. GF confesses that she thinks she might have liked the kiss.  A short summary: GF is loyal, in love with OP, honest about what happened, and generally really reacted in the best way possible. GF might not be completely straight. This is positive news because ""completely straight"" is the last thing you want her to be when you're transitioning.   OP gets horribly insecure about the situation, the relationship suffers because of it. OP and GF spend less time with each other. OP fears the relationship might be at its end. Eventually, OP decides the best course of action is to ask the wise people of the internet who know all the things and never lie.  I think you can see what went wrong here. You done shit OP, and it's about time you fixed it. Of course I don't know you two or your exact situation but from the description I've read, the only thing standing in the way of your relationship is your insecurity. I can't help you with that, but I hope that realising that your insecurity is the main issue will help you fix it. Meet her, go on a date or something, do something together where you can relax and think calmly. Talk with each other, about what happened, about all the boring shit you two did while away from each other, about your feelings. Or do something else instead of following the advice given to you by some random person on the internet who's not qualified to give any advice and who wrote this mostly because it was pretty fun to write. But do something with each other."
asktransgender,3dhp4v,regendo,2,Thu Jul 16 13:29:19 2015 UTC,"To be blunt, it sounds like your best course of action is to try to get over your insecurities. It really sounds like you will be happy together, and miserable apart. I don't really understand from this why a breakup is even on the table. Is it because you've watched too many movies about jealous partners who call off a relationship over tiny things? People interact, things happen, and a single kiss doesn't automatically mean it's time to part ways."
asktransgender,3dhp4v,TheMeanCanadianx,4,Thu Jul 16 18:12:23 2015 UTC,"Wait, its just a kiss. its not romantic interest, just a playful and later regretted kiss. When I kiss my partner, or even when I do dishes with him, its in the context of a deep love that we have for each other. Kissing a friend wouldn't even be the same thing. Calm down, and continue to enjoy the time you have together."
asktransgender,3dhp4v,flopsflip,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:02:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should say you're together but can see other people. If neither of you then do, well, you're just together."
asktransgender,3djbop,cornismaize,2,Thu Jul 16 19:00:50 2015 UTC,"I completely understand where you are coming from. After I transitioned I was barely scraping by, SRS/GRS seemed so far away. I completely put the thought of it out my head, or tried to. Coming up with 15k (what it was back then) was practically impossible. Transitioning and the dot.com implosion destroyed my already terrible credit.   When the ACA was rolled out and I was able to get insurance and all of my care including surgery was covered I became ecstatic. For a minute. Long story short, the process for getting the surgical referral from a doctor has taken 8 months and is still in limbo. I'm not sure if I should get legal help or go back into therapy to convince myself I don't need surgery. If I have to lawyer up it pushes surgery back even further then in the meantime the wait list is getting longer. So yeah those treads trigger me. Last night I read on another board where some girl with the same insurance who lives in the same state is already in pipe to get surgery though Bowers. So that seriously triggered me. Suicidal? More so than at any point in the past."
asktransgender,3djbop,mskittynoir,2,Thu Jul 16 20:14:13 2015 UTC,Can you tell me anything about ACA and insurance? My policy through my employer still has a specific exclusion for trans surgery. Is there a way to fight this?

asktransgender,3dgmt5,OrangeLaceChair,15,Thu Jul 16 04:37:50 2015 UTC,Which is fucking perfect. She hasn't lived the life that many trans people experience.

The fact that she's a motivational speaker doesn't prove to me that she's a wonderful speech writer or good at delivering them. People pay George W Bush to speak at events, too. That guy is as eloquent as a rock, but people pay just to listen to a President. Sometimes getting paid to do talks is about people wanting to be near your accomplishments, and the words don't matter.  But maybe I watch too many TED talks and have decent expectations of people I'm supposed to listen to and gain some wisdom from? That doesn't make her a bad person or something.

My parents called me within an hour of reading it, because I mentioned that I wanted them to take the time to process their initial feelings on the situation first.

I also knew I had to tell them as I just couldn't hold it any longer and won't chicken out.   A letter would be an easier way. Hand it to them and its done. If you're there while they read it will be probably nerve wrecking as well while time seems to be stopped.   Also if you send or leave a letter for them.

There were all these beautiful men out there - why hadn't I noticed them before?  For someone who had really felt pretty certain about liking women and only women (to the extent I thought that fact disqualified me from being trans, which is silly, but what I thought) , the idea that I might actually be straight seemed...disappointing and unfamiliar.   Like the first time I had a thought pop into my head while talking to a good male friend of mine that ""huh, he would make a cool boyfriend..."" Uh, awkward.  For me though, as time has gone on, I've actually regained attraction to women and all genders really and identify as pansexual. I still have hangups about dating guys that prevent me from enjoying it to the extent I could (lingering homophobia from my male upbringing probably, which is as silly as it sounds), but now that I've done it a few times, and just let myself go and have fun, it's made me a little more comfortable with the idea.  It's not something you can do much about so really best you can do is observe yourself and hang on for the ride. We're undergoing a process of change, this is just one of them."
asktransgender,3dhj73,gegenny,3,Thu Jul 16 10:37:35 2015 UTC,"Lately I've been having very similar thoughts. Always thought I was attracted to women - and yes, there is an aesthetic beauty there, but I can't help but wonder if that was me idolizing the type of body I wanted now. To an extent, I do find women attractive I think, but I'm just not sure any more. I'm thinking I might be about a 2 on the Kinsey scale, maybe even a 1.  I realized in the last two years that, sexually, I've almost exclusively imagined myself as the female in heterosexual positions. Since I started masturbating, I've searched out female pov porn and stories.  The funny thing is, since I realized this and then started transition, I have for the first time seriously fantasized about being with women. But it's still not nearly as frequent as with men, and in either situation I'm always the bottom. So I actually think I've got my sexuality pegged (so to speak) for the first time."

And there is the whole normally imagining myself as female with a man. And when I focused on women in general I would often end up thinking about me and my role during sex, but maybe if I accept I'm female I can think of me with other women. Still not sure yet."

asktransgender,3dhj73,omgitsbecky,2,Thu Jul 16 09:48:40 2015 UTC,"Well I've always fantasized about being with men when I was first starting to have sexual fantasies. I thought at the time I was male, but I could only end up imagining myself as female with a man. Though I got aroused when looking at women. And I still do. But I think that might be in part because I learned to focus on myself. Not wanting to be gay, and assuming I was male. I was heterosexists to a degree. I thought I would be attracted to females, and I only was willing to focus on their features sexually. At first it was out of ignorance, later I forced myself not to.   In middle school I had been called gay day in and day out. So I tried my best to actively shut away any thoughts I might be gay. Any image of a man I avoided. And I developed Homosexual OCD. Which can lead to groinal responses (yay). But I really didn't think I liked men at the time. I just was confused is how it really felt, and I felt this was all brought upon by being teased.   When I said more masculine or more male. What I meant is people whose personalities were dominant and aggressive. And crass to a degree. Masculine personality types (though women can be masculine). But physically there was this hangup. I couldn't understand what it was people liked about men physically.   Though I was watching a music video and I just started to get attracted imagining the man in the video in a sexual situation with me. And all of the sudden I went from not being able to be aroused by men, to feel very aroused by how rough and greasy they looked. And all nice and tough. It's so different though. Completely opposite almost to what I used to find appealing about women, and it just feels like a shock. I don't know how to really love men. It feels weird and awkward. And I'm still not so sure I'm positive about it, but if I am well this really feels alien to me. I don't know what to make of having feelings for men."

So, about a month ago, when I went to the first pharmacy with my first script to fulfill my estradiol valerate... they couldn't fulfill it, they couldn't even order it in, they didn't even know how. I had to go to another pharmacy, and they couldn't fulfill it at the time either... but they had an on-site compound lab, but what they didn't have was the compounds to make it. So, they had to order in the compounds to actually make the estrodiol for me.   If you want to deal with a local pharmacy, you need to just phone around and find out which of your pharmacies have a lab. Once you have a pharmacy with a lab, they should have the capability to produce it for you, even if they need to order in the compounds. The trick is finding a pharmacy with a compound lab, not many small pharmacies have them.  Any pharmacy compounding lab that you 'want' to deal with will have the capacity to find what they need and order it in. If they can't, you don't really want to be dealing with that pharmacy... it shows a certain ineptitude on their behalf, and would you really want them dealing with your medications?  Rule #1: Stay away from Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacies."

Most compounding pharmacies don't do sterile compounding, it takes expensive equipment and training that most places just don't have, but I was able to track down 1 outside the city which can produce it definitely, 1 new pharmacy which should eventually be able to in Halifax, and 1 in Dartmouth that may be able to and will get back to me early next week. I also tracked down a location in Moncton NB that produces it regularly and is willing to express post ship it on a recurring basis.

It's difficult when it's your job to accommodate sensitive people with understandably conflicting morals. I've been in this position before, wondering if interviewing/hiring ""alternative"" people to work with children is the best course of action when parents can be so conservative. Despite my personal viewpoints, decisions like these can negatively impact business. I say this: bring her in for an interview, and watch how your clients respond. If they don't seem to mind, or welcome her, proceed as necessary. If she initiates a strong negative reaction, you may want to reconsider, just like you would any other candidate if they didn't get along in the work community."

asktransgender,3dg2ef,BuffyCreepireSlayer,20,Thu Jul 16 04:11:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, buts simultaneously I want to argue that this is exactly how systemic cissexism operates. It perpetuates further stigmatization and transphobic assumptions of trans* people, and particularly mtf folk.   It reminds me of a 1950s public service announcement that painted gay men as predators, pedophiles, and murderers.  You'd scoff at anyone who claims these assumptions, and I'm irked at invalidating a person as a potential candidate for a job (where they hopefully help people who simply identify as a women and not just cisgender women).  /rant  I absolutely agree that safe spaces should be maintained, especially for people who've experienced trauma."
asktransgender,3dg2ef,Cononymous,13,Thu Jul 16 05:51:09 2015 UTC,"To clarify, I certainly don't think they're at greater risk of victimization from trans women, but victims of trauma frequently have intense negative reactions to anything that reminds them of the trauma, regardless of whether it presents any kind of current threat. And it can be very important that they be allowed to control whether they're exposed to those things, especially when they've just escaped the traumatic situation.  I find the comments in this thread complaining about those bigoted trauma survivors in a women's shelter absolutely abhorrent. Maybe they're bigoted, and maybe that's part of why a trans woman on staff might make them feel unsafe (and maybe not). But the time to address that issue is NOT when they're in a women's shelter and in the middle of fleeing an abusive situation.   Which, I kind of went off on my own rant/tangent there. I think we're fundamentally in agreement here."
asktransgender,3dg2ef,BuffyCreepireSlayer,4,Thu Jul 16 06:08:24 2015 UTC,"Ah, I think we are in agreement as well.  I tried my best to rant on the idea, not towards you, because you seemed to (me)  to be coming from an empathetic place.  I'd also want to just ponder about how truly ingrained we are to assume that because someone is different from us in some aspect of our identity, or a minority/marginalized identity (i.e., race, ethnicity, religion/spirituality, gender, sexuality, class, education, size, and umpteen more),  that, that specific aspect poses some ambiguous, unfounded threat.    And these are usually the big ones - which we can replace trans woman with (any minority) woman and more so feel how loathsome that train of thought is.   And again, I also want people to feel safe, but I'm wondering why (even though I, and everyone else in this thread have never seen this woman)  some folks first jump to making assumptions about her presentation/making statements that focused of how she might be perceived physically, rather than myriad other relevant details to working around people who experience trauma.   Yikes, too many thoughts to contend with."

In this specific case, though, I'm thinking that any masculinized features might set off a traumatic reaction, and that these women might not understand enough about trans folks to understand that the person they're seeing with masculinized features (again, if she has them) is not actually a man. And it makes complete sense that these women would be very afraid of men if, as OP says, they've been subject to abuse by them."

Would you not hire someone from Florida if their communities thought Floridians were idiots?

As I said earlier it doesn't even have to come to this; just pick someone else out of the many applicants.  I am just sensitive to the idea that a bunch of women who've just gotten out of trauma might not want to be always in earshot/in the same room as (what they perceive as) a man.

If it only caters to cis women you might as well put up a sign on the door that says ""CIS Woman's Shelter"" So people don't get the wrong idea that you are actually there to help every woman in need.  If it does cater to trans women then you're comment about it being a white woman's shelter makes no sense. And no I wasn't talking about genocide. There are times when people in real life are traumatized by people of a certain race. It happens. There are times when people are racist, its fairly common. You don't let that sway peoples opinions in this matter. You don't chose to say that some women might have been abused by other women, so we don't want to hire a lesbian.

Unless you meet with her then you'll never know whether she would ""pass"" or not.   I can understand that you don't want to cause your clients anxiety and make them feel uncomfortable and unsafe, even if the reality is that they wouldn't be.  You do have to consider the fact that somebodies presence might trigger things in your clients. If we were discussing a situation concerning transmen and women and something or someone was introduced that was going to set of triggers in them then we'd not be saying that they have to just get over it, we'd be saying that it wasn't right and shouldn't happen.

Under the circumstances, it's very possible that social work and similar positions can only be filled by women.  I'd buy that argument (and vice versa for a men's shelter).

I used the word I used as genetic, because of how I have been confronted by XX bearing not XXY female presenting people for the most part. That genetic is different.   XX people post development in the womb only have one X functioning per cell in the entire body. Thus why those with just one X to start with can bare children.  The Y is also shutdown after the womb. It's primary purpose is to single the Mullerian process to select testicle ducts. The Y has 83 genes verse the 3000+ the X has.  Most maleness and femaleness is actually in other chromosomes. For example, the ESR1 and ESR2 genes that are for estradiol receptors on cells are found on the 14th chromosome.  Saying XX is genetic female and XY is genetically male is the common word, however, factually speaking scientists have learned that is a crude approximation at its best, and at worst a tool used by those in the majority to hurt all kinds of gender minorities when using the common ignorance of people.  XY people have been born who can bare children. XX people have been born and bare children and turn out to be things like chimera, where they're both XX/XY.  The X has three genes capable of the SRY sequence on the tip of the Y that is accountable for testicle selection in gonads. And gonads can have crossed tissue, such as ovarian testicles, and testicular ovaries.  The concept of XX and XY meaning gender is baseless and a way to hurt all gender minorities.  Scientists have been trying to over turn the diatribe for decades. For example, this published paper in Science.  Your words may not hurt feelings, and they may, however, your words are incorrect and are often used to actually hurt the lives of all gender minorities. That is why you are being corrected here. Please consider using the correct words with the correct understandings. <3  EDIT: We are genetically women, regardless of XX or XY, or anything else. What is female is not XX, but what is expressed from all the chromosomes when sex hormones enter a cell and cause the cell to change genetic expressions. Our genetic expressions are female. That's why this is even possible in the first place. Similarly trans men are genetically male when using the facts of how genetics and hormones work together and throwing away old oppressive definitions that didn't include all the information."

That's not the concern of the topic, though I knew it would devolve into that.  What is important is to skip over the fact that I am talking to people more versed in their concept of gender vs sex vs chromosomes and talk about it from the lay (cis)-persons view.  Based on real interactions I and I am sure others have had.  shrugs I appreciate the education, but it's nothing I didn't know.  And to be honest, linking to a google scholar article that that piece was taken from and linking it back to other studies done would have been far more impactful IMHO.  [quote]Her body was built of cells from two individuals, probably from twin embryos that had merged in her own mother's womb. And there was more. One set of cells carried two X chromosomes, the complement that typically makes a person female; the other had an X and a Y. Halfway through her fifth decade and pregnant with her third child, the woman learned for the first time that a large part of her body was chromosomally male1. “That's kind of science-fiction material for someone who just came in for an amniocentesis,” says James.[/quote]  I believe this is commonly referred to colloquially as a chimera, which is not the same thing as what we were discussing with intersexed people. I am having a hard time seeing where this addresses my questions and doesn't further complicate the matter. Can you pull the actual article and show me where it indicates that?  If not, I'll be happy to track it down this week and continue this conversation in another fashion."

asktransgender,3dgx9b,usuallycam,11,Thu Jul 16 04:34:06 2015 UTC,Doubt is just something you're gonna have to get comfortable with. It's fundamentally unresolveable.
asktransgender,3dgx9b,badschema,3,Thu Jul 16 04:52:59 2015 UTC,"Not really. Or at least not for everyone. In the beginning i had plenty of doubts, but the further i moved on, the more i got sure in my identity. I am female, there is no doubt about that anymore, and there have not been for a while now. I don't think i will ever doubt that anymore.  I still have doubts if transition was the right thing to do though, but that doesn't stem from having doubts in who i am. Its the loss of cis privileges that suck so hard for me, that i am not always sure if it wouldn't have been easier for me to stay a man externally, and repress my true identity. But i would still be female on the inside. But then i have to remind myself how hard it was for me living as a male, so... nah... transition was the right choice. Even if i am not fully happy (and probably never will)."
asktransgender,3dgx9b,g0ldent0y,2,Thu Jul 16 09:31:45 2015 UTC,"It took me about a week of doubting and questioning after first realising it and months later I haven't had a doubt since. Unfortunately, circumstances mean I haven't been able to start transitioning yet regardless..."
asktransgender,3dgx9b,justcallmeash,7,Thu Jul 16 13:25:07 2015 UTC,I've had this thought quite often but looking back for me 15+ years of denial and self hate I realize it's a legitimate thing.
asktransgender,3dgx9b,threnodis_ocelot,3,Thu Jul 16 05:13:13 2015 UTC,"As someone with OCD. I understand doubt. For example, spellcheck is telling me that OCD is spelled wrong, and for a moment I worry that it is spelled wrong. For this there is one thing to remember. The situation that you are in has scientific backing. It comes down to neurology. The fact of the matter is that your brain patterns match those of a male. So while your body my seem female, you are male."
asktransgender,3dgx9b,whyhavename,4,Thu Jul 16 07:17:26 2015 UTC,"I wonder often, mostly because of my mental issues and the medicines I use to help me there. I try to allow myself to trust myself. I think most of the doubt comes from the idea of how difficult transition is. It's not so much do I really feel this way I think as much as will doing this incredibly difficult thing that will change my life forever be worth it forever? If I try and don't like it, I'll have put myself and people I love through a lot of stress only to end up feeling dumb and embarrassed.  But I know that if I could hit a magic button and become the person I want in my head, I wouldn't even need to think about it. Therefore I have to assume it's all the hard stuff before the happy end result that is making me doubt my feelings, or afraid they are a symptom of something else."
asktransgender,3dgx9b,summer_d,3,Thu Jul 16 05:16:13 2015 UTC,"Heyyy, I remember you! We talked here a couple days ago.  I'm also still unsure (the dysphoria ebbs and flows, leaving me to serious doubts on the low/no dysphoria days) but I was thinking about gaslighting just yesterday and came to the conclusion that I am perfectly capable of gaslighting myself. I was taught by people who are very good at it, heh.  Point being, your inner dialogue can definitely mimic the way you were treated as a child, and it could totally be gaslighting you into doubting yourself -- especially if you have a history of abuse, I think.  I had a mentor in college tell me once, ""We are most afraid of the things we need to confront to grow in life."" I'm still trying to internalize that but I do think it's probably more true than not. I can't speak for you, but I don't think my fear and doubt would be so palpable and ever-present if transition wasn't at least a little necessary. Cis people don't usually ruminate so hard over stuff like this."
asktransgender,3dgx9b,rainbow_unicorn_barf,3,Thu Jul 16 06:01:07 2015 UTC,"Cosigned, so much.  FWIW, I came out now almost 13 years ago, started medical and legal stuff around 11 years ago, have had surgery that made my body instantly feel so much right-er...and still periodically have this self doubt. Cisnormativity trains us that if we doubt our transness we are probably really cis, but that if we doubt our cisness we are both really cis and also mentally ill. To survive as trans with certainty leaves so little room for engaged self-analysis, but doubt gets all tangled up in transphobia so easily."
asktransgender,3dgx9b,throughdoors,2,Thu Jul 16 08:03:04 2015 UTC,"Hey there! :) yeah I definitely gaslight myself. Usually in my mother's voice. I've tried to picture coming out to her and it mostly ends with her being very dismissive and insisting I'm crazy, or something.  I also agree with your mentor. Like probably this is something I need to do, to see where it goes, to finally be some kind of okay with myself... But it's scary :("
asktransgender,3dgx9b,Anna_the_potato,2,Thu Jul 16 16:54:50 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much the only reason why I really, really want to go over things with a gender therapist before I even think about coming out or anything! It freaks me out.  From lurking on this subreddit for a while (I actually signed up so I could post onto this subreddit because I think I'll need more help to get where I want to go, since I'm pretty much pre-everything), I get the impression that for a lot of people (including myself), dysphoria tends to come and go."
asktransgender,3dgx9b,illuminess,2,Thu Jul 16 07:22:51 2015 UTC,"Yup. Doubt is all part of the process. Just think about things in the long run rather than in the moment. If being a woman sounds good to you 10 years from now / 20 years from now, then that says it all. If you're unsure, that's okay, too. Try to see a gender therapist if you can. They can be a huge help."
asktransgender,3dgx9b,gegenny,2,Thu Jul 16 07:50:23 2015 UTC,"As I spend more and more time in my correct gender presentation, it becomes more and more obvious this is the right decision.   Takes some getting used to at first, but it's like jumping into a cold swimming pool - a shock at first that sometimes prevents you from wanting to go in, but once you're in, you get used to it and it's hard to want to get out! :)"
asktransgender,3dgx9b,KKae,2,Thu Jul 16 10:21:21 2015 UTC,As soon as I went full time 99% of doubt disappeared sure its uncomfortable initially but it felt right even if I looked a bit odd at first.  For me I wanted to be sure and practical experience gave me that. Perhaps you need more time or to push your bounderies a bit further.
asktransgender,3dgx9b,arkwald,2,Thu Jul 16 10:30:58 2015 UTC,"All the time, and in those moments it gets tantalizingly close to the idea I can finally step out of this fog and finally get this all behind me. That I could accept who I was supposed to be and this all collapses back into just a bad dream.  Then I find myself trying to break down these barriers to feel all these feminine things I have in my head. The need to feel pretty, to feel excited, to feel validated as a woman. These desires have driven me to do things I wouldn't otherwise want to do, but it was how I knew to express those pieces of me. Like the kind of girl who just plays the part of being a helpless girl. Not because she is actually deficient but because that is what expectation she  learned to fill.   So I ask you, is that all a rationalization of some crazed psychosis or do I legitimately have a woman's brain in a man's body? Or maybe there is no difference between the two and in the end we are all souls bound to these meaty fluid sacks just trying to avoid the end as long as we can? That all the distinctions we see beyond this are just genetic and social distinctions imprinted on us for the sake of the goal of avoiding that end?   There is a reason why this is so difficult to pin down."

Oh course, y'know, you don't have to be straight-up binary. Regardless of the current climate, being non-binary is just as valid an identity as any other. Maybe you just like cross-dressing? Or maybe you're simply more used to your old ways/old life, and it feels more comfortable. Maybe transition would be the best thing, in the end, but the trouble getting there is just too difficult at the moment. I don't know.   I've been having concerns that being trans is just a thing I made up in my head to be special   I'm not really sure that I've ever heard of this happening. Why would anyone choose to be trans, anyway? I say just roll with whatever makes you most comfortable right now. If that means presenting female all or most of the time, then why not do it?"

asktransgender,3djfk6,ijustlovecutethings,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:28:23 2015 UTC,"1) Sexuality and gender identity are 2 totally different things. Wanting to be with a guy has nothing to do, in itself, with your gender identity. Now, feeling ""like a girl"" in that situation does, but make sure you're not equating ""feminine"" with submissive. Also 2 different things.  2) A lifetime of confusion and suffering is not a pre - requisite to being trans. Lots of people live decades with nothing more than passing inklings before realizing they are trans. The realization may cause them to look back at those odd feelings differently, as well as bring on dysphoria then but not everyone has a story that starts with ""I think I always knew.....""  3) Gender is not binary. Plenty of folks here will tell you they feel both male and female at different times. Maybe even a bit of both all the time. There is no dichotomy.   Try to separate your ideas of sexuality and gender.  Try to let go of preconceived notions of how you think it's ""supposed to feel"" to be trans and just focus on how you see yourself and how you want to be seen. If you don't see yourself as presenting 100% as male, you're some flavor of trans. Welcome and good luck, sweetie <3  PS- fwiw, I'm a 40+ lesbian trans-girl.

You don't have to hate being a guy for you to be trans but I mean you write that you don't ""quite hate"" it which suggests to me that you're not quite the biggest fan of being a guy either. And you clearly feel that you'd rather be a girl.

Reporting and having a troll or harasser removed doesn't remove the damage, so once that's done it's important to help yourself. No matter how I've responded to harassment, or how cool I've played it, there's no getting around that sometimes it really does hurt.  For this I try to remind myself of the source of the harassment. I remind myself that this person and their opinion of me has no bearing on me as a person. They are cruel, sick people who take enjoyment out of causing others pain. On that basis alone, the validity of what they say to you is already worthless. If revenge helps you feel better, reassure yourself that they are suffering just from being who and what they are. Regardless, they aren't worth your time or hurt.   I hope that helps some on the emotional aspect, because no matter how strong we are, people still can and do hurt us.  Love yourself, and protect yourself the way you would a friend who you care deeply about."

For example, I'm not sure if there is a difference between spiro and cipro in regards to this.   There have been trans men who have spotted HRT after 10 years on T and then gotten pregnant, but there's no guarantee (just like there isn't prior to HRT.)

I thought I read something about Cipro being worse than Spiro in this regard but I forget where I read that.  It's interesting because so many doctors still tell trans men that T will very likely make them permanently infertile. It was even on my informed consent paperwork. I wish there were more studies done on trans people so we could know more about the long term health effects of being on HRT for so long instead of being stuck with all anecdotes.
asktransgender,3di5ol,vancitygal,2,Thu Jul 16 14:29:44 2015 UTC,"I have a friend that's a trans guy that was on T for awhile and got pregnant. Again, anecdotal.  Yeah, I think that it's because testosterone is required for continual support of the cells that support sperm production and become sperm. I myself banked some sperm, then went on blockers/estrogen for like 6-8 months and then went off them, my sperm came up a little bit but not much more to bank a little more. I was able to get like 12 vials of sperm on the first banking and maybe like 3 vials on the second. So already within that short period the production had gone down quite a bit. That was also after waiting for awhile for my numbers to come back up. I had sperm that was very low for a few months with abnormal morphology."

asktransgender,3dfusp,ILuvLollipops,10,Wed Jul 15 23:05:39 2015 UTC,BIG OLE WARNING: you know the drill by now.  I was sexually assaulted when I was ten. I was put into therapy and saw councillors as well as my mother taking me to victims groups to help try and cope with everything. I just remember seeing people who had been assaulted around the same age as me and they were still having serious issues with it. I thought I would never be able to sleep without waking up crying in the middle of the night. What made matters worse was by 12 I was starting to question my gender and I felt wrong. I told my parents and they said it was my trying to justify in my mind what happened to me. That if I was female it would be better somehow.  I lost hope.   I took a belt and went to my closet. The post that my clothes hung on ended up snapping. My parents heard me crash to the ground and broke the door down when I didn't respond. I ended up in the ICU for a while and a mental institution for about a month. I have that mental hospital to thank for helping me. I realized that I wasn't broken and that if I wanted something bad enough I just had to break the problems down into something I can do.   Now I'm happy healthy and posting here as success story. It DOES get better.   Edit: switched others for clothes hung...stupid phone autocorrect.
asktransgender,3dfusp,tanuki_chau,3,Wed Jul 15 23:17:32 2015 UTC,"Thank goodness for cheap posts, that's rough. :/"
asktransgender,3dfusp,Sarahthelizard,10,Thu Jul 16 03:34:39 2015 UTC,"Only tried it once.   Thought about it every single day. Sometimes coming very close. Simple things like, oh I could jump off this building. Oh I could step into traffic. I would sometimes even step into the street without looking, not caring and sort of hoping. Sometimes I would intentionally move towards a speed car, stopping at the last second. Sometimes almost throwing myself in front of a train. Subways were always so tempting. The only reason I didn't was my cats. I made a commitment to them when I adopted them.   But why the constant thoughts? Life fucking sucks. I'd wake up every day to be reminded of my own prison. Trapped in this body, not able to fully live my life. I lived in the middle, without gender, and yet something was very wrong inside my head. I was trying to escape who I was, to be above being binary and trans. But missing a large chunk of my life, of growing up proper. It was this constant weight this constant poison in my head. I also didn't have a very good support base or social circle.   Going outside was torture. Seeing other people, seeing gender on display. It was a constant attack and a constant reminder. I actually transitioned before I started HRT, which is almost the reverse of the reddit experience. It helped me deal with social things better but my mind was still this fog and disgusted mess.   Getting on HRT fixed me mentally. It's still amazing the 180 in my mind. I now know my mind was being poisoned by a hormonal imbalance. I have a medical condition, my mind doesn't match my body. The chemicals it was receiving was wrong. I no longer feel unbalanced. I feel completely balanced. Instead I kick myself I didn't realize this cure was out here sooner. I was too busy fighting my own reality, trying to be better and above such things. I was stupid.   Now, if I feel sad, it's simply due to my economic situation or my inability to find worthwhile people who live nearby. Just normal things. I experienced happiness, for the first time in my life, this past weekend.  I no longer think of suicide, I found my cure. My mind finally feels free. The depression is gone. Everything, in my head, feels proper. I love the ability to think clearly. Like holy shit this is what life is suppose to be? Not that constant mental weight and being on edge constantly?   I am really amazed I survive as long as I did. Being Trans, living my authentic life isn't brave. My bravery, and courage, was dealing with my previous life and somehow not killing myself."

asktransgender,3dfusp,MinorityStress,6,Thu Jul 16 00:44:21 2015 UTC,"I started DIY pretty recently and, well, I haven't told anyone this yet, but it was to stem the increasing amount of near-attempts, mostly that'd happen when I was drunk.  In January, I fought three of my friends in an attempt to get to the sea to drown. I was drunk and uncoordinated enough that nobody was hurt and I was easily stopped, but that was a really bad night. Other nights like that happened to a smaller and less obvious extent, but I got closer and closer each time to actually following through (usually I was thwarted by sobriety, the presence of people, or drunken laziness :P ). I figured DIY was the only thing that would make me want to stay alive long enough to see results or to get to a point where I'd be on prescribed hormones.  I just felt hopeless and lost, and I didn't think there was any way I could achieve or do what I wanted to do. So I took a big step forward and just did what I wanted to do, regardless of the expense or who I'd have to lie to."

I was convinced I was broken beyond repair.   Fortunately I had a friend who had talked to me earlier and sensed something was very wrong. when they didn't hear from me called the police and basically saved my life. Got myself a nice long stay in a psych ward which was terrible enough that I never wanted to get near such a thing again. But even then, I was well on the way to killing myself with substances anyway.  At the time it seemed like the only option, but from where I sit now, it's amazing how wrong I was. It does get better, maybe not in the way we expect, but that's probably the most wonderful part about it."

asktransgender,3dfusp,farieniall,2,Thu Jul 16 00:59:25 2015 UTC,"It was about 2 years ago, not sure if it counts as an attempt but I did attempt to get enough pills to make an attempt.   It was pretty much narcissistic dad + abusive girlfriend + invalidating doctor + depression and anxiety + eating disorder + seasonal affective disorder + questioning my identity and having no idea what was wrong with me.  I don't remember much as the memories for 3 - 5 weeks around the attempt are blurry."
asktransgender,3dfusp,sarahPenguin,2,Wed Jul 15 23:26:12 2015 UTC,"So... I've made two attempts I'd consider major. I've been in therapy for a very long time and I was becoming increasingly depressed because I felt like I wasn't making progress. I didn't feel any better than I did when I was 10. I was also facing the fact that my autism wasn't ever going to get better.  So the first big one I made a couple of years ago now. I made a makeshift suicide mask thing where there was a painter's mask attached to some tubing which was attached to a helium cylinder I bought online. I poked some holes above the nostrils to prevent buildup of carbon dioxide. I was about 30 seconds in when I heard my mum come home. I didn't want to be resuscitated so I stopped and figured I'd do it later. Thankfully I didn't.  Second one would've been about a year ago. This time it was pills. I didn't bother hiding the packaging of all the pills I took. My dad found it and forced me to hospital, where they fixed me up.  I generally feel better since starting transition which is great. Thanks as well, this has been pretty cathartic."
asktransgender,3dfusp,anomine2,2,Thu Jul 16 01:39:48 2015 UTC,"Yep twice. Once on my 14th birthday right after I had come out to a friend. I tried to hang myself with a thick leather belt over the stair well. I passed out and turned blue but the belt snapped in half and I fell down. The second time was last summer I had stolen my uncles handgun, gotten blackout drunk and took some shrooms. I hoped the depressive high would make me brave enough to finish it but I didn't know how to load and shoot it, and I was too far gone to look it up in youtube. I remember figuring it out (I think) and teasing the trigger halfway back, but then I had a very strong hallucination and decided I needed to live. If I had borrowed his other gun, with a light trigger for quick draw, I'd be dead.  The second time wasn't about trans issues. I was just depressed. I know a lot more about guns now, and I even own one without any temptation. Still, I'll probably die to my own hand one day."
asktransgender,3dfusp,Aisren,2,Thu Jul 16 02:02:31 2015 UTC,"As always, this could TRIGGER an ideation, you have been WARNED.   My first attempts were as a child. I was about 8 years old and would hit myself repeatedly in the head with a hammer. I am still not sure how I survived it at all, let alone without serious brain damage. I would end up with big knots on the side of my head and tell my mom I had tripped and hit my head on the curb. I fell a lot. I also got in a lot of fights, all bullies, of course, that took out what ever aggressions they had pent up.   In high school I had a friend commit suicide. Trying to follow him, I cut my arms not knowing what I was doing. It hurt and was bloody, but it wasn't even close. The doctor doing the stitches as how it happened I said it was just me being clumsy. The fact no one ever said anything to me is something that baffles me now. That my parents didn't want to know or understand is the only guess I can come up with.   I kept a razor blade with me at all times for years. I would find a quiet place and just hold it. I remember vividly one time sitting in a friend's driveway and grazing it over my veins. It was so peaceful.  I escaped inside myself after that. I had a face I showed everyone while intensely hating everything about me. I loathed what I felt and despised the sight of me.   When I finally accepted I was transgender I was equal parts elated I had identified what I was feeling, in despair over it feeling impossible, and increased self hatred for proving all the people who had tortured me over being girly as being right.  All my attempts until then had been the release of the raw hatred and despair I felt. The attempts from then on fell short because I must have feared death on a basic level. Looking back at my attempts to overdose and hang myself, if I had really wanted to, I think I would have done a better job.   My attempts finally caught the eye of a therapist I was seeing. He told me I had to admit myself or he would. Until then I had hidden my attempts, but now the reaction of friends and family ripped my heart in two. I swore then and there I would never try again.   That soon changed to, until my dad died. My plan was to slowly disappear after his death and do it where no one would find me. I would just alienate everyone so they wouldn't miss me when I was gone.  Thankfully I turned my life around before that happened. Now suicide is the farthest thing from my mind. I love life and look forward to my future."
asktransgender,3dfusp,CorruptPixie,2,Thu Jul 16 02:04:56 2015 UTC,"Idk if this counts as an attempt, but it's the closest I ever came, and it was the rock bottom that made me finally come out. About 5 months ago I was still convinced that nobody would ever be able to love me if they knew who I was. I had just finished college and couldn't figure out why I had even done it. It didn't really matter because any success I could possibly have would be marred by the fact that it wasn't even accomplished by ""me"". This feeling was the result of a weird dysphoria from seeing my dead name on my diploma. One night it became too much for me to handle so I started drinking, which wasn't unusual. But usually one bottle of wine numbed the pain. That night it didn't, and I started crying and opened a second. Then a third. When I still wasn't numb enough I decided I wanted to die, but knew I wasn't strong enough to do it myself. So instead, I went outside and took my motor scooter for a ride helmetless. After three bottles of wine. I started running red lights hoping somebody would hit me. I took turns at full speed. I must have rode around town for two hours trying to die. When the hangover started to kick in and I still wasn't dead I headed home and passed out.   Two days later when the hangover was gone I realized what I had almost done, and came out to my best friend, who told me she loved me no matter what. From that moment on I was on a one way flight to girl town.  I realize only one line of this explicitly answered your question. But I haven't told this part of my story to anyone yet and I wanted to get it off my chest."
asktransgender,3dfusp,liberationlioness,2,Thu Jul 16 02:44:05 2015 UTC,"I tried because things sucked. Particularly the idea of never getting surgery, and getting hormones after puberty was through with wrecking my body. I ended up DIY shortly before puberty ended, behind my parents' backs, and that helped a bit. Surgery is still out of the question for probably another decade, so really the only thing stopping me at this point are my parents. I couldn't do that to them.  But yeah, dysphoria has hit me hard, and that combined with envy during high school simply made things unbearable. Honestly it's nearly as bad right now, but I can power through just about anything at this point, in regards to personal pain.  But yeah, I'm not going to fail next time I try. Most of my friends and family are only there for me when it's convenient for them, anyway ."
asktransgender,3dfusp,arcticfox00,2,Thu Jul 16 02:44:47 2015 UTC,"Trigger warning  First time, I was 12, I hated my disfunctional family that moved due to non-payment of rent, or mom's new BF, etc multiple times a year. I had attended 12 different schools. I had been in over 70 fights (no exaggeration), I hated myself and the rest of the world. I wrote the note, and took my toys to school to give away. I was going to shoot myself with my mother's gun that night. I had agonized over the descision for days non-stop. what I ceased to exist? Would I go to hell? Would I be reincarnated as a boy, girl?  one of the children who received one of my toys,told his father (who was a pastor at the church) who told the principal who called my mother who found the note. (apparently giving away possessions is a impending sign)  my mother picks me up from school and told me we were going to the doctor so she could get her birth control shot. But instead I was locked in the exam room. I don't remember it, but apparently I fought four orderlies and was sedated. I woke up in hospital and told them everything I thought they wanted to hear. That my mother use drugs and alcohol. That I was beat by her BF's. kids at school bullying me. anything except the truth, but I was a girl inside and didn't want to face the life ahead of me. I felt that if I told them that, they would keep me there forever. Lock me away as crazy.I vowed that I would never be locked away, forced to live through a life that was torture, never able to ""hit the reset button"". I have wondered innumerable times, what my life would be like if I had come out then.  The scond time, I was at my first job out of college when I learned the word ""transgender"" and that I wasn't crazy.the next couple of months descended into pure mental hell, as all my repressed feelings reawakened. Spent months of sleepless nights browsing the dial-up internet of the day. for any information on transgenderism.there were no online support groups, digital chat boards, or TSRoadmap.Org.  most of the information out there were true horror stories and people laughing and making it worse. I knew I had to transition, but didn't know if I had the strength to face the unique challenges of transitioning.eventually I decided I couldn't, so I put a gun to my head and pulled the trigger.  only the clip was not inserted completely, a round was not chambered and when the hammer fell, The clip fell out into my lap. in that moment of clarity, and the rush / flush of adrenaline, I realized with certainty that I DID want to live. there was so much I wanted to do. And so much good that I could give. That if anyone had a problem with Who I am, it was their problem, I have no problem pulling a trigger.  the next 10 years Itransitioned on and off as employment would allow, as I gained and lost confidence. eventually I got to a low point in my life where I felt stuck, unable to change anything at all for the better, feeling like I had missed my window of HR-Tunity (pun). And again was looking to a future Trapped in misery or suicide. I tried to have myself committed only to find  that I wasn't suicidal enough for them to take me.  there was no way in hell, I was going back to my old life, I'd rather sleep under a bridge and die of exposure.no, f*** that! I'm not giving up. I'd rather kill everybody in my way (not literally) to living a happy life.   6 months of therapy, 2 years of hanging on to my HRT letter. I finally decide to bite the bullet as it were, and start HRT process without any insurance or assurance i'd be able to sustain it  financially. I have been on HRT now for 8 months. And it's more important to me than rent or food (but I got that covered,I am making more money now as a happy person)  and that's not the end of my story. I'm sure there will be many more trials in my life. But at least I have possession of my life. Not perfect, but it's mine. & I want it.including all the bad stuff that is to come."
asktransgender,3dfusp,sad-but-tru,2,Thu Jul 16 03:35:40 2015 UTC,"TRIGGER WARNING  First time I was about 10. We were on holidays and had gone out for dinner, in this little country town. The place only had a toilet for females, males had to go out the back. I felt uncomfortable about doing this, and wanted to use the toilet. My parents spent the rest of the night mocking me and calling me ""Betty the little girly boy"". At the time I was just so angry at them, and didn't really understand why they were doing this to me. I knew I was different, and I was sick of it. When we got back to the houseboat we were staying on, I went out the back and got into the water, which was flowing fairly fast. I was pulled out of the water a bit down the river, after I got caught up in some guy's fishing line and was revived.  The second time I was about 14. I was out hunting with my father, we had split up to walk either side of a track that split and later rejoined. As I walked along I realised it was the first time I was alone with a gun, so it was the perfect time to end it all. I turned the gun on myself, and used a stick to pull the trigger. The cartridge didn't fire, even though it had a dent from the firing pin hitting it. I put it back in the gun and tried firing it in the air and it went off. Next thing I saw was my dad, his side of the track was flooded, so he had doubled back to my side. He asked why I was crying, and I said I hadn't put the gun against my shoulder hard enough when taking the shot and it hit. He gave me a flogging for not holding the gun right.  The last time was when I was just at the point of going full time. I was homeless, my car had been broken into while I was at work. I had $7 in my bank account and 10 days until the next pay day, and I was just sick of all the hate being thrown my way. So I slashed my wrists. I woke up a few hours later, in a pool of blood, but the bleeding had stopped.  Things have gotten better since I transitioned, but the thoughts are still there from time to time. I just do my best to keep myself distracted from the thoughts, as I now know what most of my triggers are. It's not a nice way to live though, I wish the thoughts were not there at all."

However I don't own a pistol because I'm afraid one night I might just say fuck it on an impulse.   First time I was early teenage years. About 13-14. Didn't see a point to living, although I don't remember any trans rationale behind it. I was in the kitchen looking at the knives, but then a parent opened the garage door and came home. I went on with my life.   The second time was closer and if the knife had been sharper I would have done damage and might have died (although likely wouldn't have and would have had a shitty time after words depending on if somebody found me and I didn't take care of it myself, if I had a sharper knife anyways). I was dating my ex fiancee and in a very abusive relationship mentally, emotionally, and physically. One night I had finally had enough and was coming home from work. She was asleep. I went inside grabbed a kitchen knife (was a super cheap set that cut like shit), went back into my car, cried for a while with the knife in my hand. Finally decided to try going through with it, but couldn't fucking break skin. After a minute or two I had the thought that it wouldn't work even if I did cut myself, and my life would just turn shittier. So I went back in, put the knife away, slept on the couch, and went back to being extremely depressed for another 6 months or so before kicking her out when she right hooked me in the temple while I wasn't looking.   So yeah... fun times."

I'd never be worth anything.  I'd never find love or happiness.  My life was falling apart,  failing college,  in lots of debt,  shit job. Only 19 and I thought this was it and it was over.    It was the day before thanksgiving and I was home alone.  Family went to my grandparents.  I stayed home to work at Kmart on thanksgiving and black friday.   That night I self harmed particularly bad,  hadnt eaten in 72 hrs,  basically a mess.  Very little sleep.  I decided to stay up all night before thansgiving and just give up on work.  Not show up.  I drank 2 bottles of cold meds. 1 nyquil 1 dayquil.  That should have killed me,  but nope.  I woke up around 6pm on thanksgiving with lots of missed calls from Kmart.  Never did go back.    Later on I was trying to cut myself and bleed to death but I couldnt force myself to cut deep enough.  Idk if that counts.    Mostly the reasons for me were being hopeless about my identity,  and my future.  I went from straight As always had a plan for life to trans,  failing,  poor,  in debt,  and alone.  It was a lot to deal with."
asktransgender,3dfusp,transthrowawayOMC,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:35:30 2015 UTC,"Once, actually well after I was transitioned, in a new city where no one knew I was trans. I was in an emotionally abusive relationship, in an area where he was the only person I knew. I'd tried to get out twice and failed, and it just made it worse. Neither of us were working, my DIY was nearly out, and my cellphone had just been shut off, killing my only contact with anyone who could help.  He was in a yelling mood, and I was just wanting to sleep. After a few hours of off and on tears, I just wanted out, any way out. I had an RC benzo with similar potency to xanax, and in huge quantities. I took 300mg, and hoped to just fall asleep and that would be it.  Protip: it's REALLY hard to kill yourself on benzos. Don't try. I was completely blacked out for 3 days, and in and out for another 2. Boyfriend yelled a lot from what I remember, but I wasn't taken to the hospital, I just rode it out. I slept about 18 hours I'm told, and then functioned more or less like a drunken me until day 6. I remember being yelled at to go to the store, then him realizing how fucked I was, then yelling not to go. Then I remember backing into a parked car in the parking lot. Then I was home and getting yelled at more.  I had months of benzo withdrawals from that single dose, and eventually had 3 seizures one night. The scary thimg there was Ibwas just laying in bed watching tv, and suddenly the show had jumped forward. No idea I had a seizure, the boyfriend told me, in tears thinking I was dying. I kept asking him the same questions, amidst 2 shorter seizures. My memory was shot since them, mostly short term, and it's still not what it was. It made getting out even harder."
asktransgender,3dfusp,myaltaccount86,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:03:41 2015 UTC,"Warning: I went into detail.  One of the first times I questioned my gender was when I was about 8. I knew I liked girly things, but never showed it.  I'm prefacing with that, but I'm not sure if it's entirely related (seeing as I don't really remember my frame of mind at the time)  When I was a kid my dad and I moved a lot. Just before I turned 8 we moved from a major metropolitan area to a small country town. I was pretty shy and kept to myself, so I didn't really make any friends. One day during the summer, I grabbed some of my dads rope and headed out into the woods behind our house. I found a good tree, tied the rope to it, and made a noose with the other end. I found something to stand on, put the noose around my neck, tightened it, and kicked whatever I was standing on out from under me.   As I started to run out of breath, I started to freak out. When I was 8 I was pretty athletic from years of soccer. I was able to pull myself up and get the rope off of my neck. I got back to my house, put the rope back and made sure no one saw my neck for a few days.  I've never told anyone that story. I told an ex that I had attempted suicide when I was younger, and I'm fairly sure she forgot pretty quickly, but I've never gone into the details."
asktransgender,3dfusp,jennisf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:52:49 2015 UTC,"Twice. The first time when was a teenager, the rope was not good enough to hold my weight. The second attempt was several years ago - have lost a lot of blood but survived luckily and was 5150ed for six days. The reasons were the same: shame of myself, dysphoria, loneliness, lack of support and understanding.  However, the HRT was a great relief! I am not saying the hrt is a solution for everyone, but in my case it worked. Also I came out to my Mom just a week ago, she is very supportive and understanding! Never thought my Mom will be one of my best friend."

asktransgender,3dfusp,JennaVR,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:56:53 2015 UTC,"I went through a rough patch in the run up to transition. My finances were a big part of the problem. I couldn't see a way out of the situation I was in.  My job has very good death in service benefits and between that and my pension all I could think was that financially my family would be better of if I died.  I've had suicidal thoughts on and off for a long time, way before transition. Sometimes when I've been driving I've thought about ramming the car into a bridge support at speed or deliberately driving into an oncoming truck. The only thing that held me back was the thought that somebody else might get hurt as a result of my actions.  When I did finally attempt suicide I did it by stock piling paracetamol and then taking between 16 and 24 tablets each day; 8 tablets a time, 3 times a day. This happened over a period of 6 weeks, not every day but the majority of them. One night I woke up in bed sweating furiously. It felt wrong and was a big wake-up call. I knew that I needed help but I couldn't bring myself to seek it in the early hours because it would mean waking up the family and them finding out what I'd been doing. It was one of the longest nights I've ever spent as I just spent it praying that I'd get through the night and that if I fell asleep that I'd wake up in the morning and not that my wife would wake-up and find me dead beside her.  In the morning I got up, texted a friend and explained I needed her to go to A&E with me because I'd been silly and then set about giving my family the impression I was going to work.  I was so lucky, the doctors told me that I'd tried what was called a Staggered Overdose. They took bloods to check I hadn't done any damage to my organs and then arranged for me to see the local mental health team. Fortunately I'd done no damage and the mental health team were happy that I wasn't a danger to myself.  I still have moments when the idea of killing myself pops into my head but I know it for what it is, a passing thought nothing more, no matter how bad things get I know that there are people who have it far worse and they manage to carry on.   I'm being reminded of that fact every day at the moment.   I also know that at the end of the day, as enticing as the thought may be and that I'm entirely capable of doing something like that, I would never go through with it because there is so much more for me to do with my life still."

I needed the world to shut up. It wasn't going to do it by itself, so I overdosed to move things along.  I barely made it through that. Not breathing and having your heart stop hurts like hell. Afterward, I realized that I needed to fix myself otherwise I would just end up doing it again.  I worked on a bunch of things, but one of the big ones was that I ended up finally accepting that I was trans and started moving towards transitioning, starting hormones half a year later.

Massive amounts of depression and gender stuff. When I was 14 I stopped off school one day, got all the painkillers and medication my brother was on and sat there looking at them and crying for a couple of minutes. The only thing that stopped me from over dosing was my old 20ish year old cat who we adopted when she was 17 cause she had a terrible life. She grew attached to me more and was the only one she slept with and followed round. Anyway she was watching as I was giving up on life with this sad expression in her eyes. Might sound stupid but that was the only thing that stopped me.   Another time not so long after I got a knife and started pressing it into my neck. Stopped cause I didn't want anyone find me with blood everywhere.  Since then the main reason I have survived is to set stupid achievable goals. Like finish this box set, or see this friend one more time and that gradually grew to just making it to 18, 20, 25 and see what life is like then. I started to transition a while ago, coming up to two years, but my situation still sucks. I still dont pass really and I spend most of my time alone in my room. I am at the point again where I think about suicide everyday. Transition was the last roll of the dice but I'm starting to give up hope."
asktransgender,3dfusp,shoryo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:51:34 2015 UTC,"Telling the whole story would take too long. The tl;dr of it is I grew up in a (physically, psychologically, sexually) abusive household (father with anger issues, mother with undiagnosed severe bipolar, sociopathic sister). Not to mention dealing with all the abuse heaped upon trans girls to try beating them into behaving like boys. Add whatever genetics to this background and I ended up with severe chronic depression, cPTSD, and sundry secondary complications. To get an idea of how bad things were, I have no chronological memory prior to age 12 or so; I do have a few scraps of episodic memories, but I have no idea when they happened relative to one another. One of those scraps is a memory of wishing to be not-alive in kindergarten.  So, yeah.  I started therapy sometime way back as an early teen, which helped a lot but couldn't ameliorate my living situation. Moving away from the family helped immensely, but doesn't erase the past. The most recent/last attempt was my freshman year at college. That was also the year I first sought to transition, but had to deal with a horrific gatekeeper. Thanks to that gatekeeper I ended up deciding not to transition at that time; and in retrospect, that decision is almost certainly what precipitated my last suicide attempt.  Things are infinitely better now, and I cannot fathom becoming suicidal again; but then, I've been working through this shit for decades now. Once I finally did transition, the HRT has basically gotten rid of my dysphoria issues but it's also completely eliminated my dysthymia and almost completely gotten rid of the depression. So these days I'm only dealing with mild chronic depression (easily handled by meds; but still present enough to require those meds) and cPTSD.  If you want more details, feel free to AMA.

They have no idea how anyone could possibly live in only one gender presentation all the time.  I analogize it to my sexual preference. I'm pansexual, and I can't really concieve of why anyone would want to limit themselves to just one gender in terms of dating. Yet plenty of people will die before they date someone of a gender they don't prefer.  So as to your question:   How, in fuck, can something like gender identity--an issue so serious that statistically, half(correct me if I'm wrong, is it not 50%?) our goddamn community commits suicide over--flip-flop on a day to day basis?   Because it's just as serious to them, it's just that it's not the same identity as yours. That's all their is to it.  And if it helps, remember that cis people have zero concept of what it means to have a dissonant gender identity at all, and many have responded in exactly the same way to a binary trans person coming out."

asktransgender,3dhbxu,finiteteapot,3,Thu Jul 16 07:49:16 2015 UTC,"The reason that gender identities lead to suicide is because they require us to choose between masking some of our innermost, strongest urges/needs/feelings for our entire lives, or risking rejection by our families and societies. Humans are fundamentally social animals, and forced solitude is torture for most of us.  There's no reason that gender identity needs to line up with the social expectation of binary, static identification. Your question is borne from the erroneous assumption that the binary gender picture accurately describes the human experience. That leads to the (offensive in my opinion) description of gender fluidity as flip-flopping. There are no two intrinsic gender identities to flip-flop between. Rather, genderfluidity is evidence that the socially defined binary system is deeply flawed."

Then later in the day, it cools down, and hey, chocolate ice cream isn't such a bad idea after all.   Just because binary people like us know that we absolutely want one thing all the time, doesn't mean that others do. Maybe they want it most of the time, and not others. Maybe they want to mix it all together because that is what tastes best to them.   But hey, I really like black licorice, and a lot of people hate it. So what do I know?"

asktransgender,3dg4z9,AlbrechtEinstein,3,Thu Jul 16 01:34:46 2015 UTC,I feel like that's a really poor way to gather any reliable data. The people on this sub like to share their accomplishments with the sub. Not many people are likely to make a thread about how they've never had even an inkling that anyone is attracted to them. That's called the voluntary response bias. Only the people who are volunteering to share their experiences are sampled which biases the results in this case to likely be much more positive than they realistically might be.

You suppose wrong. There are lots of threads about people struggling with this. This sub partly exists as a source of support, so the response bias in this case means people post about their troubles as well as their accomplishments.  Either way, /r/asktransgender is no more a reliable source of data than /r/askmen or anywhere on reddit. But there may be a real study out there about trans people and their relationship experiences."

Just because someone here does or doesn't have a relationship doesn't necessarily have any bearing on whether most people are willing to date trans peeps in general. It would just show that either that individual doesn't have any luck which provides no meaningful data, or that they do happen to have a relationship which doesn't show what proportion of the gen. pop. would be willing to date them, only that however many people that have dated them were willing. I was not in any way trying to say that /r/askmen isn't a poor sampling source though. Sorry if I gave that impression. That's why I was asking if anyone here knows of any studies on the topic."

It's a smaller pool for sure, but it's not a non-existent one.  Mostly though if you become a person you would want to date, and are happy with who you are, that will show, and other people will want in on it. :)"

I feel like most of the time people that are not even comfortable with it in the abstract won't be likely to change their mind. In fact many of the comments I've seen in threads have basically stated that if they started dating someone, really liked them, then found out that person was trans then they would feel personally cheated out of their time and money. Not to mention the functionally brain dead who think that if they had sex with a trans person and didn't know then they were ""raped"".  It's people and comments like that that make me unsure of how to even pursue dating. I think a small portion of people would change if they realized they were attracted to a trans person before knowing that about them, but I feel like that's setting myself up for disappointment. Then again if you disclose information like that upfront then their preconceived notions about trans people will either bias anything they see in you to begin with or straight up deter them from even being open to a relationship to begin with. I don't have answers for questions like that, though, but I feel like I don't at all pass right now so it doesn't apply. The point of my overall question though was to get a rough estimate of how many people (in my situation specifically guys that aren't gay) would even be open to the idea of a relationship with a trans person (in my case trans women) to know how better to try and have a relationship. For example, if a reliable poll was to show that the proportion of people that I am looking for a relationship with that would be willing to date a trans person is very low, which I assume it is, then it would be in my best interest to not disclose that I am trans. If the proportion is relatively high though, then I feel it would be in my best interest to disclose upfront to weed out people that would never be okay with me. Does that make sense?"

It's just not going to be based in anything real for the most part.  That, and ultimately you have no control over other people and their preferences and predilections.   I guess I'm saying worry less about the opinions of random internet strangers and more about how these sorts of questions make you feel, and the type of person you want to be, and what you are comfortable with. If you were going to date someone, how would you like to know about their past? etc.  In terms of personal experience I've found it best for me to talk about being trans early on in any conversations, but not to put it out front, because it's just not that important to my external identity, but it's very important in terms of my internal experiences. If I treat it as a deep dark secret or something to hide, other people will react accordingly. If I just relate it as another detail of my life, they often will follow my lead."

I would never presume to have or even want such a thing. I just wanted to find a study like this because I want realistic outlook on my chances. I don't want to think that I have no chance when the actual numbers might be better than I hope. I also don't want to think I'm set (lol) only to keep putting myself out there for most of the guys I'm attracted to if the reality is that they are extremely unlikely to reciprocate. When we have more information about the situation we find ourselves in it's lets us make better decisions to reach our goals in that setting. Knowing is half the battle as they say."
asktransgender,3dg4z9,liberationlioness,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:00:46 2015 UTC,"I just think you're probably better off just getting out there and seeing for yourself; any such study would be flawed to a degree where it would be giving you information that is useless or wrong, which is worse than no information."
asktransgender,3dg4z9,mislabeledhuman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:19:17 2015 UTC,Well I like to think I would judge the information on its own merit.
asktransgender,3dg4z9,arcticfox00,2,Thu Jul 16 15:01:19 2015 UTC,"I think this is the wrong way to go about looking at things. It's not the case when you go looking for a partner that you make a random draw from the pool of all <insert huge category here, like ""straight guys"" >, and then try to date them.   There's waaay more factors that go into it, based on who you are. So whatever poll you get wouldn't really be that helpful without also showing subbreakdowns into things like ""how nerdy"", ""how into animals"", ""how compassionate"", ""how much do they like cooking"", ""where in the country are you located""  etc etc etc.   That poll does not exist.   There is a nonzero number of straight/gay/bi, guys/girls who are interested/willing to date trans people, and trans women specifically. Does it actually matter if most straight guys wouldn't date you? You don't want to date most straight guys, or most gay guys, or gay women, or bi women, or most people because most is a huge word here. Just find enough people and you'll be fine. And those people absolutely exist.   I'm sorry this isn't directly providing you with information on the poll you're looking for, but I hope it helps answer the question that I think is behind it. You could try getting in touch with OKCupid (I know they periodically post to a blog talking about data crunching their member info) and ask if they have information on those demographics for members who answered anything to the question ""would you date a trans person?"" ; maybe it would inspire them to write a whole post on it too."

asktransgender,3dhyfg,pinkprinny,2,Thu Jul 16 12:35:58 2015 UTC,IMO it would be better to go 1-2 days without spiro than just increase your E that you take
asktransgender,3dhyfg,Hi_Im_Teagan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:47:03 2015 UTC,A day or two without Spiro won't really have any effects. If it were me I wouldn't mess with the Estrogen dose.

asktransgender,3dhu7q,glitch_g,2,Thu Jul 16 11:50:39 2015 UTC,I happen to really like My Gender Workbook as a very easy-to-read starting point.  /u/asher-d is also right that the feminism subs will likely have some nice ideas.
asktransgender,3dhu7q,nezumipi,2,Thu Jul 16 13:26:20 2015 UTC,I'll try taking a read :)
asktransgender,3dhu7q,Asher-D,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:10:18 2015 UTC,From what I understand it's a feminism class. I recommend asking feminism subs about it if you're interested in it. If you mean you are interested in gender identity and what it is then here is a list of books on the subject: https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/gender-identity
asktransgender,3dhu7q,ZoeyKaisar,2,Thu Jul 16 12:09:46 2015 UTC,Just be careful not to become a TERF. Much of the source literature (Bell Hooks - cough capitalization cough) can lead people that way.
asktransgender,3dhu7q,Asher-D,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:26:33 2015 UTC,I'm a bit afraid of running into TERFs if I ask this in a feminism sub. :(

Although I'm pretty sure /r/twoxchromosomes is anti-transphobia and I think they should know more about gender studies.
asktransgender,3dhu7q,ftmichael,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:44:35 2015 UTC,TwoXChromosomes is a default sub now so it's kind of a mixed bag. It's mostly non-feminist.  AskFeminists is good.

asktransgender,3deyo9,boisegang,3,Wed Jul 15 19:15:27 2015 UTC,"Well you definitely should talk to your therapist, you said you told your mom? Is she supportive at all? And I hate to say it, but since you seem to come from a divorced family, you can kind of use that to your advantage. ""If you don't accept this, then I won't come over anymore"" which would totally screw over your dad with child support.  You definitely sound trans, but 'Your Results May Vary' is the truest thing, just look at /r/transtimelines! some hot girls were really ugly dudes at one time, and makeup and clothes can makeup for a lot."
asktransgender,3deyo9,Sarahthelizard,3,Wed Jul 15 19:27:51 2015 UTC,"Is she supportive at all?   Yeah, she's supportive. She just thinks that I should hold off transition until I'm eighteen, but I feel like I should start ASAP before Puberty does its damage.   And I hate to say it, but since you seem to come from a divorced family, you can kind of use that to your advantage. ""If you don't accept this, then I won't come over anymore"" which would totally screw over your dad with child support.   I don't really have much of a choice when it comes to who's house I go to. Besides, my relationship with my dad is already strained as-is, and I'd hate to bruise it even more than it is.   some hot girls were really ugly dudes at one time, and makeup and clothes can makeup for a lot.   I don't like makeup. Too much work in the morning. I like to sleep in :P"
asktransgender,3deyo9,Sarahthelizard,2,Wed Jul 15 19:44:53 2015 UTC,"You should talk to her at least getting on puberty blockers so no more growth happens, but you don't grow breasts and look girly immediately.   Ah, well, I think you catch my drift lol."
asktransgender,3deyo9,Sarahthelizard,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:13:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'll try. Hopefully she'll agree.  I understand HRT and such are very long procedures but, hey, everything that's worth it takes a while to achieve, right?"

asktransgender,3deyo9,burnsbabe,2,Wed Jul 15 20:11:54 2015 UTC,People are incredibly unobservant when they want to be. Do not rely on anything short of you saying 'I am trans' to suffice in this regard.
asktransgender,3deyo9,tanuki_chau,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:53:37 2015 UTC,"People are ignorant, yes. It's a very small detail, which means they'll miss it if they don't pay that much attention. I understand what you're saying 100%.  But I don't mind my adam's apple. I don't hate it, I don't like it, but I'm indifferent to it. Besides, I can always get a tracheal shave if I want(If I've got the cash)."
asktransgender,3deyo9,transinit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:21:09 2015 UTC,"Power to you, definitely. I'm not saying 'get all of the surgeries because it is your duty to satisfy cis people' I'm more just offering that people, no matter who, do not appreciate games being played with 'em. And that they are ignorant, nothing short of direct information suffices."
asktransgender,3deyo9,burnsbabe,3,Thu Jul 16 02:05:21 2015 UTC,"Wow, there's a lot here. No one can tell you if you're trans but you, but as a general rule, cis people don't think this way.  Having a supportive mother is a big deal. It'll help so much more than you could know. Get in to see that therapist and work stuff out.  As far as puberty and ""holding off"" you're certainly old enough to get on puberty blockers if your mom is 100% against HRT before 18. It'll make you feel better, most likely. The blockers are 100% reversible so no commitment.  As for the other stuff, when we're coming out we tend to over-analyze everything. No one is gonna know if you washed with ""girl shampoo"". Indeed, I'm not sure such a thing really exists. Shampoo doesn't have a gender, just heavily gendered marketing. Likewise, there are plenty of guys (cis and trans) who wear nail polish. Assuming you don't think you'll get too much grief from your dad then just go for it. It comes off. Since it seems like your parents are divorced, you might even manage to convince your mom to buy you some girls briefs or something if you're feeling especially brave asking.  On the body stuff in particular, most people tend to feel this way. I don't want to oversell HRT, but it's pretty magical, especially for someone who's not even 18 yet. You may not end up looking like a supermodel but you'll almost certainly end up looking like a girl and that's the goal, right?  Feel free to reply, PM me, or whatever you need to do. Venting is helpful. :D"
