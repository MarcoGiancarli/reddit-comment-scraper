Here's a ban appeal, where the mods discuss how a banned player sat on a button all game, among other ""working against own team"" occurrences.    True, the player in question did more to hinder his team than simply sit on a button all game, but the mods seem to recognize this as bannable behaviour. It would be interesting to hear what a moderator has to say about the Button Bob situation."

I think you could work on your mechanics a little bit, snipes, bomb snipes, corner jukes etc.   I haven't seen you play that much offense recently, but your grabbing/flag holding and choosing good routes to stay alive could definitely be improved.   Your communication is generally very good, but sometimes you tend to say ""oh shit oh shit"" instead of saying where the fc actually is.   Your positional awareness can be lacking, like you'll rush a little too far when coming back with your defensive partner allowing a boost past 2.   On offensive/d you lunge sometimes and allow for an easier blockout."

TagPro,3dy0r9,ndprice,4,Mon Jul 20 19:13:58 2015 UTC,"Alright so I am gonna write out a lot for this sorry if its kinda unprecedented since I don't know you too well but I have been watching a lot of your film these past two seasons.  I think that you have an overly aggressive style of play that doesn't suit your strengths as much as it could. In part I think that comes from the previous defensive partners that you had in tack and spiller because, while not in the same way, they both had strong contain games. A lot of times this lead to you adjusting your style to be a more aggro defender which to me seemed to come in bursts. I just get this from gameplay watching rather than personal experience but it would look like you alternating between zooming around the map exhausting the accelerating chasing options such as boosts/bombs and then periods of cautious contain where it was clear that you were communicating with your other chaser quite a bit. I think this is the biggest fault in your play because you often get out of position trying to get the reset/return and if you don't get it you double down on being cautious to make up for it/stop the cap train.  Personally I think what would truly elevate your gameplay is changing playstyles to be all about positioning. I think that you could be an extremely aggressive postioner (I know that's not a real word or position or whatever). I noticed that gem and nads and jj were the same way where they just slaughter the opposing offenders by cutting off their routes and always getting there first. It isn't so much about them being more mechanically gifted or anything it just seems that even when the flag is out of base they are still dictating the pace of play (when the opposing fc can make a play, what routes they can take, what map options they have left that they can take advantage of). I think this would really suit your style because I don't see you as a mechanical marvel but rather a smart player.   In addition I think the positioning playstyle works well with the lead communicator on defense, which from what I have seen of you play/heard in listen-ins is what you feel comfortable with. I think if you were to pair up with someone like ibis, who doesn't communicate as often, it would work really well because you could make the call-outs and take away all of the offenders options while he annihilates in base.  This is pretty rambling and long winded and I am beginning to forget the point but I think that an aggressive playstyle makes you overextend which immediately takes out  what I would consider your strengths to be and a positioning focus would benefit you much more."
TagPro,3dy0r9,neyvit1,2,Mon Jul 20 22:22:55 2015 UTC,This is really spot on.  You should charge for this shit. Do me do me
TagPro,3dy0r9,ndprice,2,Tue Jul 21 03:53:46 2015 UTC,"Alright I can give it a shot but in all honesty you are a much better pure offender than I am and do things with the flag that look like they have no right to work out but then they do so it’s a little harder for me to grasp your play style especially from the mechanical juking standpoint.  Also you are one of the few elite tier offenders so I guess some of this would be geared towards superball quality of play rather than just good because pretty much any offense can be good with you.  I think the biggest thing that I have noticed is that your offense runs through you and off of you. This is both a testament to your ability as an offender and in times a drawback because of it (this is not including gb s7 so much because I don’t fully understand how noblord works). Defenses can anticipate your team dynamic because eventually you can be cut off and gameplanned around. You know that Tpr is gonna do his shit and you can plan for it. A lot of times you will burn the defense or juke them or out position them but those are just things you expect to lose going against you because it’s gonna happen those caps are inevitable. But any time that you don’t have the flag means an opportunity that the opposing team can take advantage of. That is when to press, that is when to go aggressive and get your capping opportunities because as soon as you are returned your team is vulnerable.   I am a bit too lazy to find examples but a lot of times when you make a quick strike for a cap or get returned doing those crazy things in base the opposing teams have either gotten a revenge cap or that’s what starts the regrab chain start going.   Now this isn’t really a bad thing because those sorts of offenders that can make those caps happen are a huge offensive advantage and can swing games but I think an ideal pairing to make your game stronger would be a partner that you could run the offense through, a powerhouse offender. Crosky and Altiger come to mind from the west as guys that can truly dictate the pace of play in their offensive styles. Obviously it’s a little difficult to get one of those guys as a partner because they are valued but hey I said this would be geared towards winning a superball.   One of those types of offenders as a partner would completely change the dynamic of your gameplay because you could have shorter hold times and push for caps in a more aggressive manner without it being so much of a detriment when you get returned. They would be the one in charge of getting the flag out of base and keeping it out for a while to get a reset, they would be in charge of mid pup as the game goes on and they can get it while carrying whereas you get it early game and transition to their base pup midgame, they would be the one that could stabilize through holding.   You have had a higher hold time than your offensive partner in every season that you have played majors with only noblord putting up similar numbers in s7. I think it would be a super interesting dynamic to see a reversal of that freeing you up to do what I would consider your greatest strength of pushing the flag but it would begin to negate positioning hole it can sometimes put your team in.  I think the peak parts of your game aside from just holding and doing Tpr things are your variety of lanes and routes that you use, your offensive defense, and your ability to make moves in your own base with the flag when the opposing offense is in base. You utilize a lot of quick pop-ins to base and that creates a lot of capping opportunities but I think utilizing more corner rolls would make you even more effective. I noticed you and noblord did a lot of them particularly on wormy last season maybe noblord even moreso but the speed of your corner rolls is lethal and what I would consider to be one of your best mechanics.  As far as your defense most of what I noted was from your halves on velo which it’s defense on velo so take it with a grain of salt. But you seem to play defense like an offender and while it’s stout it can start to be exploited. What I mean from that is that when there were two in base and you were on no grab it felt like one continuous block that you were trying to hold. The entire time was a fight for positioning which makes sense because that is exactly the right thing to be doing but again it makes you a little predictable. They know you are going to be trying to block them out so they will gear their plays around that. Sometimes I have watched Stann and ibis and others immediately give up positioning at the beginning of their contact with the offender and coordinate a push or a flip with their partner. They either bait a grab or bait a sense of security in positioning and a lot of times it will work out just from the fact that it isn’t the exact positioning over and over that can be exploited. So I think some variation in your in base positioning would make you a much more versatile defender.  As far as your chasing goes, you have what strikes me as a I am gonna get you motherfucker chasing strategy and that manifested in a lot of boosting around. Again this was velo so that’s pretty much all you can do but it came down a lot of times to you angrily chasing close behind but ultimately the offender was choosing where he wanted to go instead of the other way around and you gave up control over the pace of play.  I forgot what conclusion I was trying to get out of all of this it is mostly just stuff I have noticed watching you. The biggest thing out of all of this that I would find interesting would be a change in offensive styling where the offense runs through your partner because as good as I think Tro and Manbear are, I think they fit better into a system where the offense has been running through you."

TagPro,3dy0r9,Dreamy_Zebra,2,Mon Jul 20 14:31:32 2015 UTC,"from what i remember last season.   great intangibles - powerup and communication is as good as you could ask for. one extremely high level thing that you do is that when a round of pups come up, everyone starts blabbing the times that they pick up and just talk over each other, but you would wait for everyone to be done and then speak clearly and concisely. so your call out was actually effective because people could hear it, and you would be actively listening to other people calling out. not aggro enough with the flag. you would hover in the back of the map to wait for regrab to get set up, but wait way too long. of course getting Papi (aka FUCKINGTANK) on regrab was a strategy that worked very well for 2K1ASA... but there was definitely some offensive effeciency that could have been eked out of the two of you as a pairing if you were more aggressive. be less timid with the flag and make laps with the focus of the end of the lap positioning you near your base at the right time. the key is to be as aggro as possible while also guaranteeing a regrab for your partner. i'm sorry about #hyamezgotrobbed. it was a super weird circumstance that we would get an insane FA while being a top team in the league... and that led you to the bench. i'm sure you understand the decision though. gl rest of season and future."

It has the same shortcomings that other NF maps have (which is to say you can smushie a cap in just as easily as any other NF map).

Bulldog is well liked and has double-sided scoring-tiles RocketBalls is different, but familiar to a lot of people, so it might satiate that thirst for something different, while not being completely strange at the same time.

Since it's had a slight resurgence lessening of hate as of lately, I've been tinkering with two different designs that I've been unable to sneak past the Hitler committee Map Test Committee, so far. So I thought I'd post them here to see if they resonate with people or not. Is this something people are interested in seeing in rotation in the future?  RocketBalls Redux (Slight updates)  ThunderBalls (Complete redesign from bottom up)"
TagPro,3dy0h1,DaEvil1,5,Mon Jul 20 14:28:49 2015 UTC,Thunderballs is much cooler. The major flaw with RB is that it takes a team to cap and then it's an easy recap for other team. Thunderballs looks like regrab will be even more powerful but capping easier so it might cancel out.
TagPro,3dy0h1,bowtieTP,3,Mon Jul 20 14:40:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my main fear about ThunderBalls is that it might be a bit too long to work as a NF map without reset portals. There's a lot of easily accessible boosts that would hopefully help people get back into position quick enough, but that's something that's really hard to be sure of before I've seen a lot of 4v4s on it."
TagPro,3dy0h1,DaEvil1,3,Mon Jul 20 14:46:03 2015 UTC,"Like I said, making it easier to cap will help. Plus it has powerups. What about something a little crazy and you put a red superboost at blue base so atleast one person can get back to their base?"
TagPro,3dy0h1,bowtieTP,2,Mon Jul 20 14:51:42 2015 UTC,"I'm skeptical about adding another offensive teamboost to the map as that might make it too hard to defend, but the way the boosts are set up, it doesn't feel too bad to have a teamtile that allows you to superboost back to base next to the teamboosts already in the map. If anything, it should give you the option to rush back and go for a quick semi-lucky return, and if the fc dodges, you might have just enough time to get back into position anyway."

TagPro,3dy0h1,DaEvil1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:56:48 2015 UTC,I getcha. It would just be nice if it wasn't always maps from a couple threads ago and occasionally one of the classics was thrown in.
TagPro,3dy0h1,bowtieTP,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:00:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we have to balance it between just having the same old faces show up and not depleting so many maps that only unenjoyable maps make it into throwback rotation. As we boot more and more maps that are alright-good it makes more sense to have a bigger quarantine on maps that have recently been in throwback. So I guess depending on if we get rid of more maps in the next few threads, my opinion might slide more towards a longer quarantine. Which classics in particular are you thinking of btw? Many of the older maps were in the negatives from the last thread, so I'm not sure how many would get in from pure voting. If we decide to decide a couple maps in the future as a committee, the chance would probably be higher that classics would get in."
TagPro,3dy0h1,DaEvil1,3,Mon Jul 20 15:15:37 2015 UTC,"I was thinking like Simplicity, Vee, Hyper Reactor. Things that are still generally okay but just don't have the following things like Star have."
TagPro,3dy0h1,bowtieTP,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:44:03 2015 UTC,"I recommended star+rocket and then shine+jagged the following week to avoid having two NF throwback at the same time or two tiny throwbacks at the same time. The way that the voting thread indicates it will happen is both CTF this thread and both NF next thread, but I thought it made more sense this way."

TagPro,3dy8v0,ZiggyA,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:29:20 2015 UTC,I can't tell if it's the fact that the competition is tougher or if the smaller userbase results in less-optimal matchmaking (worse ping) but I've had absolutely terrible luck on ranked matches.    Even if I'm having a hot streak in normal games and really in the zone I'll end up getting spanked in ranked games.

If you think about what the RB is doing it makes sense from a physics perspective - it just kind of sucks when it happens!

TagPro,3dvvfs,StrayCam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:53:36 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm playing devil's advocate here, but I do not like any of these changes except the ""sticky"" snipes but not sure how it could be fixed.   This rule is the closest to plausible, but it ruins the strategy for a defensive RB. Most defenders do not simply stand around after picking up an RB and I would, as a defender, disagree that RB isn't a useful pup. If need be, I can bomb everybody out of the way including teammates that are blocking enemies and force them even further away. This rule does not help or hurt RB, just changes it. There would be immediate hate if this rule was put into action because offensive players knowing when it would run out could bomb a spawning player into a spike on almost any map. Also, they could avoid spawning players just after grabbing. This is possibly the worst of the attempted changes. If I go to grab the RB and an enemy player with TP is going for it, I might as well give up. Not only do I risk not getting the pup but a) the enemy player could pop me as I grab it, making it less useful than before or b) the enemy player could grab it, pop me and still have the RB because it would not activate.   I agree that RB is the least useful powerup in most scenarios, but it is also the most useful in a lot of scenarios that other pups are not.   For example,  Offense: If I have the flag with RB going back into my base, I know I can get rid of the opposing regrab and cap on my own(assuming a return from my team) with only an RB.   Defense: There are many opportunities to skillfully line up the opposing player with a spike or friendly tagpro and force a pop. RB is not a crutch on defense if used properly."
TagPro,3dvvfs,EndangeredKoala,2,Tue Jul 21 00:25:52 2015 UTC,"TBH I don't understand most of your concerns. Most of them actually seem like the reasons why I'm for these changes.

Then would you agree to have it not affect your FC then? Would that be a good compromise? You can agree that it is definitely worse that it affects you FC, right? However, I think that we're so used to everyone being affected by the RB that some people don't realize how useful it would be to not be affected by it. It would be SIGNIFICANTLY easier to bomb enemies into teammates if the teammates don't move when the RB is used.   There would be immediate hate if this rule was put into action because offensive players knowing when it would run out could bomb a spawning player into a spike on almost any map. Also, they could avoid spawning players just after grabbing.   Then that's your one use of it. It would be the same as using juke juice to block the enemy from going, which any talented player can do.  But there would be no reason to, it would be better to use it for re. Most maps don't even have spikes that close, and I'd argue that offensive players don't want to waste their pup like that unless it was almost out anyway.

I did not think about a situation with tagpro, thats fair and does complicate things slightly.  However, ""the enemy player could pop me as I grab it"" is not true because you're invulnerable for that time, except now you have a chance of keeping the RB. You normally give up when a tagpro is waiting on the pups anyway, so what's the difference? This time you get a chance of actually keeping the pup.  And yes, I guess in this situation if they grab it and you dont, you get popped without it being diffused. They beat you to the pup and should deserve to keep it. Why should it be it any different than them picking up a jj or another tagpro? they keep those if you touch them. I don't see why RB should be weaker just because that's the way it's always been"

We don't want everyone to have to report bugs about Vanilla Tagpro as we get this off the ground.  Please note, this does not apply to spectator scripts.  If you are a TagPro player who reports bugs, you need to do two things:   Review all of your installed scripts and validate that it is present in the whitelist.

I just hung out in my team's channel. Going out of my bunker takes a lot more energy and effort than just staying in my channel and talking to my friends and I'm ok with that beacuse 1) I don't have to expend social energy which I'm usually trying to recoup when I log onto Mumble and  2) I'm happy with the friends I have. I don't really feel an obligation to go to a random PUB channel or NLTP centra team channel to try and make friends.

To those who exhibit this behavior regularly, I ask you, ""Why the hell are you on this social platform?"" If you want to be alone, move your cursor to the top-left of your monitor and select 'disconnect.' If you want some peace and quiet, move your cursor to the top-left of your monitor and select 'deafen.' Each person who connects to the Mumble server is greeted by a set of rules, one of which just so happens to be the proper use of channels. Since when were channels created for seclusion? This is a gaming/social platform. By exhibiting antisocial behavior on the North American Mumble, you are unknowingly encouraging others to do the same through learned behavior. Remember that you are neither the center of this mumble nor the center of this universe. Act accordingly.   Now that, I will not follow at all. That analysis is pretty ridiculous considering that  A. I have my right to come on a ""social platform"" and not talk to anyone. I don't NEED to talk to anyone on Mumble. I CHOOSE to actually talk to random people on the internet. I like to chill on Mumble when I get off of work in the morning and chill there for my friends to connect later on. In the meantime I pub in my ""personal channel"" or I play Dota 2. That channel is not private. People can come in and chill there if they want to. I usually play Dota to kill time and that's one of the only reasons to why I made that channel. If someone wants to pub and play Dota, ask me. I'm a simple man.  B. No on is going to see me in my ""personal"" channel and say ""Well, if he has his own channel, then I want my own too."" That's not how human behavior works. I remember being on Mumble for 2 days and I saw asdf in his ghost channel............. and that's it. I didn't want my on channel after realizing I couldn't join it. I continue with myself to another channel.   Over the past six months, the North American mumble has not only become relatively more hostile, but more importantly, socially divided.    I hang out with my social group every now and then, and sometimes there's a new player that is introduced to Mumble. We welcome them in open arms. If they're cool, we cool. If they're assholes, show yourself the door. Simple and short. I don't see a pattern of people disowning new players at all. Every time I go to a channel and I don't know anyone, people greet me with happy voices. (Maybe that's because of my rep, but who knows.)  The reason it's so many ""cliques"" it's because of there's no recent pushes. The last major push was ages ago. Remember the drought we had when we only had 10,000 subscribers for like 7-8 months. I'm not saying that caused us to be ""cliquey"", but with no new players to be introduced. Everyone seem to get comfortable with there usual friends.  I can't speak for everyone and I know that there's a different perspective with each Mumble user for Tagpro. But don't say that the server has become more divided without hearing from EVERYONE. But that's the case there, do you know everyone that comes on to the server? Because I don't. I don't care to get to know everyone. It's unhealthy to be in everyone business just because we're on a social platform. Social groups happen. And they always will. If we enjoy to be around the people that we like and enjoy their company, then why should we be forced to stop that because you see a pattern with a select group of players. There's no patterns of hostility amongst the users (from what I've seen.) And I think the Na server is just fine as it is.  Tl;dr I disagree with this analysis and hope that you guys continue to do what you guys do on Mumble."

TagPro,3dw1ck,halfmoon_kid,2,Mon Jul 20 15:12:48 2015 UTC,"Remember any and every USC incident from multiple teams getting angry at one another?   I don't see the problem in venting about things that make me mad to my closest mumble friends.  I'm pretty passionate about Tagpro, so there are things that make me angry within the community and leagues.  Nate, you were a captain for the Raging Balls of Fire.  In your experience, is it healthier to vent your concerns in a private mumble channel with the people you know best, or air it out in a public forum for everyone to see?"
TagPro,3dw1ck,halfmoon_kid,2,Mon Jul 20 19:52:58 2015 UTC,"I hang out in ""Idos treehouse"" (locked channel in ghost room) a lot when I just want to be alone, but if need be, people can contact me (not that many do but lol yeah being a captain it's best to be there for your team at all times.)   Secondly all the Dev/mod channels you're talking about are totally understandable to be locked. I don't think you fully get it. Just having asdf as a cocaptain for nltp, we have players constantly coming into the channel to ask for help and what not. Tbh if you knew how much these mods/devs were contacted, you'd want to be left alone as much as you could be, while still being able to help people.   I don't find mumble to be a shut off area for new players. So many players have been introduced to mumble, and they've branched out to other players on other servers, clearly showing mumble isn't locked off.  Im an older player, came a little before cz push, and I'm still making new friends/meeting new people. (Might be because I'm a little more known but even then my rep isn't amazing) there's so many players that welcome other new players with open arms. Just because there are closed channels, doesn't mean they don't want to be your friend. You should really take into account their reasons for staying in a locked channel. I've just recently met dodsfall and like 8+ new people I had never talked to, within the past month. So to say mumble is closed off, that's really not true at all. If you're going to continue to say mumble is closed off, it's because the new player isn't willing to go outside his comfort zone to meet new people, that isn't our fault were not checking mumble every hour to see if there is a new player we can introduce ourselves to."

TagPro,3dqokm,PrivateMajor,8,Sat Jul 18 15:40:00 2015 UTC,People feel the design is so popular that it shouldn't win? Isn't the point that the most popular shirt removes the chances of others winning because it wins?
TagPro,3dqokm,PrivateMajor,5,Sat Jul 18 18:52:04 2015 UTC,I would prefer you just let this one be submitted to the official contest.   It will cost much less for people.

I dialed down the costs on Teespring as much as it would let me - my estimated profit is only cents on each shirt sold.  The campaign is only 10 shirts away from being fulfilled, so I'd rather not pull it unless there's a very strong motion to do so. I don't want to kibosh official tshirt sales either."
TagPro,3dqokm,brent12345,5,Sat Jul 18 19:42:33 2015 UTC,"The point of the shirt contest is to make it so large amounts of people get the same shirt.  Many people only want to buy one.  If you do this, many of the people who purchased will not want to purchase the next one.  I would like it if the community could rally behind one shit and get really excited about it, instead of the wind getting taken out of the sails.  It would make more sense if it was in the middle of two contests, but we literally have a t-shirt competition going on right now, this is perfect to go into the existing structure.  Edit: Also, a lot of people won't see this because it's not stickied, so either they will likely miss out on an opportunity to get it."

TagPro,3dme5d,Crisis_Averted,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:30:01 2015 UTC,"Haha, love your diagram. #3 is probably the easiest, since it's just creating on a 2-D and extruding it. I might try out your Idea #1 and do the cut plane view if blender has one. I no longer have access to solidworks =(  But you know what would be cool though, just create two simple spheres and run on abaqus to look at deformation when they collide. I guess it's going to be a dynamic problem so getting the solution would be extremely tricky (not even sure abaqus would do it), but thinking about the karma you are going to get! Actually, I wouldn't be surprise if someone had already solved this problem. brb looking at old papers"

But can still export to stl file so been playing with it.   I would probably just set the starting material as homogeneous and isotropic (not sure about linear elasticity since... it is going to be nonlinear once they start colliding). But like I said, not sure how easy it is to do dynamic analysis on abaqus since I've only done solid analysis. Like I wouldn't even know how to set the boundary conditions for colliding spheres."

If you use Chrome, you can get google extensions. The first ones to look into should probably be TagPro Mod Manager which allows you to change the skin or texture pack (how it looks). The upside to this is that other skins tell you things like where pups will spawn and the spin of the ball etc.   In terms of replays and clips, that's an extension in chrome as well, called TagProReplays. When it's successfully installed there will be a record button on the right beside you TP window that saves the last 30 seconds if you hit it.

TagPro,3dntlm,Risktp,12,Fri Jul 17 23:01:39 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'll just outline what I've found works for me:  Back on Sphere Factor, banzai and I would heavily prioritize no-grab defense. To the extent that our prevent numbers ended up being two standard deviations above the next highest team.  Really, we didn't allow the offense to grab at all. Our logic was: If someone was respawning back in their base, it's less likely for US to get out of their base. It was also a good way of keeping one of their defenders on offense, if they caught themselves out of position and was stuck with one of their defenders playing temp. offense.  Although as the season progressed, we became really skilled at having one of their offenders baited into a grab while we had their flag. Normally banzai or I would swing our momentum towards their only possible escape route, but give them a chance to grab. This basically lured an enemy offender into a false sense of security, and they would make a grab despite being contained. Easy tag and good chance to cap at that point.  Basically, I find getting prevent is pretty much really important, but that's not to say ""WOW ONLY GET PREVENT"". But sometimes if you can lure one of the enemy offenders into a bad grab, you give your team a better chance to cap. You just have to make sure you can get that tag."
TagPro,3dntlm,InnerPeaceBall,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:22:54 2015 UTC,"And to add to that, once they grab, if you can safely contain, quite often your defence will be able to get out during this so you can return after they escape, leaving them ahead of 3 ideally."
TagPro,3dntlm,DaEvil1,14,Sat Jul 18 08:24:34 2015 UTC,"Another point is that if you don't let their offense grab, YOUR offense doesn't have to deal with returned balls popping up and making it harder to get out of base all the time.  So yes, on most maps, playing prevent D instead of grab&return D is a better strategy."
TagPro,3dntlm,TackPro,11,Fri Jul 17 20:04:22 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, if you play prevent, the other team always have 2 guys in your base to make it hard for your flag carrier to score."
TagPro,3dntlm,Rum_Ball,5,Fri Jul 17 21:30:16 2015 UTC,"Play prevent until your team has the flag, switch to return style when you feel like FC is out. Profit!"
TagPro,3dntlm,Xelif,7,Fri Jul 17 23:37:59 2015 UTC,Only 2 in base is a good situation for your team.
TagPro,3dntlm,TackPro,6,Fri Jul 17 21:54:56 2015 UTC,"If your team has grabbed and is out of base, it's often helpful to let the other team grab so that they only have to deal with 1 in base, though. Obviously that's more for pubs than competitive, where they know not to grab..."
TagPro,3dntlm,Clue_Balls,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:27:43 2015 UTC,"This is true, yes"
TagPro,3dntlm,TackPro,7,Sat Jul 18 01:00:51 2015 UTC,"Everything you are describing is on line with how the majority of competitive players will play defense. However many players, competitive or not, will just play pubs differently just to have more fun with it (unless they're going for that 75% flair). Also, some maps can be played effectively with alternating between prevent D and snipe D (see: IRON, Pilot) but typically you should clear bombs near your base as much as possible (GeoKoala, Wormy, Renegade, etc) because they are A) much harder than boosts to control/snipe with and B) have a wide blast radius that can obviously screw plenty of things up for both your D partner and your offense.  Basically, you list off a lot of proper no-grab defensive aspects but I definitely wouldn't expect that playstyle from teammates in pubs even if they are MLTP defenders. Seems like you should get involved in NLTP, Ranked PUGs, or nightly tournaments if you aren't already! You'll see a lot more coordinated no-grab D in those games."
TagPro,3dntlm,TagProNitro,6,Fri Jul 17 20:20:41 2015 UTC,"The quality of my d has been getting worse the longer I've played this game. With time regular defense became boring. Sniping, bombing and grab-returning is fun and addictive, but yeah, stick to no-grab as long as you can. It's very effective, and mentally exhausting for attackers!"
TagPro,3dntlm,Crisis_Averted,4,Fri Jul 17 20:29:35 2015 UTC,"This is my opinion on PUBs, I do not play competitively but I have around 90 degrees with a decent win rate, but I am no tagPRO  I feel like you'll get a lot of different opinions on this, which is good! There are many styles of D. Is it really FAR BETTER to play ""lame, positionally sound, prevent based defense and force the offence to make a great move and do some magic""?   Maybe. You have to understand that their O will play D against your returning FC, and often times if they can delay your FC just by a few seconds, then that can be enough for the opposing D to catch up and deliver a final blow to your FC. I like to mix aggression with my D, and I feel if you can force a mistake on their part you can gain a large advantage -- if your FC is carrying their flag to your base.   Of course this opens you up for counterplay from their other O player, and in PUBs its pretty easy not to be on the same page as your teammate. So the safest way to play is prevent D, but dont be afraid to mix it up.  Personally, my favorite way to play D in -PUBS- is to try and make the opponent tilt. I play mostly prevent D, but once my team has the flag I like to play aggressive. AKA either zoning an O very hard from the flag, killing their O, etc. Those sexy boost plays (try not to boost backwards if you can avoid it) and forcing their FC to grab ETC are all high risk-high reward plays that will ultimately depend on the situation, your judgement, and your trust in your teammates and your skills.  One last thing to keep in mind is the skill level of your opponent. Some opponents you will have to respect much more or they could burn you, but those players are good because they have practiced and are versatile. They can play passive or aggressive, and know when to do so to maximize their winning %. I would suggest mixing up how you play D and just having fun with it until you are sure of what YOU think is best and develop your own style from there. That is the most fun in my opinion :)  Hopefully other people answer your other questions, and remember.. you only need 3 caps!"

TagPro,3dntlm,dedicaat,2,Fri Jul 17 22:34:13 2015 UTC,"Didn't read the other responses yet, but I try to get a quick picture of how good a player is when the PUB starts. If they're a weak grabber I'm probably going to bait them into grabbing. If they flaccid and I know I can probably get the tag, that makes it far easier for my flag carrier to score. In that sense it is a super valuable strategy. Clearing them out of base is good.  If it's a player I already know, or a bit of an unknown quantity, I play more no-grab until I can get a better feel for how to use their weaknesses against them, if at all."
TagPro,3dntlm,theycallmebbq,2,Fri Jul 17 23:42:03 2015 UTC,"Baiting them for a grab is a good idea when you know that your FC is coming back to base, makes it easier for them to get their juke mojo on."
TagPro,3dntlm,Jubjubs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:32:21 2015 UTC,"I like you! Even as far as competitive goes, prevent defense is usually the way to go, at least that's way I see it anyways. I mean you could always play grab-defense, but it can sometimes make things more difficult on your offensive teammates to grab, especially if they grab and all-of-the-sudden there are 4 they have to juke around. Prevent=Time for your offense to try to grab. It's probably one of the most overlooked aspect of defending because there is usually a greater focus on getting returns because it looks good on the stats sheet. You won't have to try to get as many returns if your opposition can't grab the flag! ;)"

TagPro,3dntlm,TheRealA_Tom,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:39:29 2015 UTC,"there are two main types of defense: prevent defense and grab defense. Prevent defense is what you do: just dont let them grab. Grab defense is when you position yourself so that the other team grabs but you pop them right away. there are pros and cons of each one (you've already explained the big con of grab defense and the big pro of prevent defense). If you play good prevent defense, the other team isn't going to be able to grab the flag as easily. that may seem like a good thing, but as a defender, you need to make things easy on your offense. With good prevent defense, there's at least one opponent in your base at all times, and two in base at least 75% of the time. with good prevent defense, its rare for your fc to come in ahead of 3, and even more rare for him to come in ahead of four. unless you and your partner are expert 2v2 blockers, scoring won't be easy for your team either. In grab defense, the other team is in your base a lot less often, giving your fc a bigger window to score. it also allows you to send their team into the three seconds of respawn more often. three seconds may not seem like much, but we're talking about three seconds of 4v3 or 4v2 time that your team otherwise wouldn't have. and it's not just three seconds, they'd be getting sent to respawn over and over, giving your team more and more time to take advantage, opening the window a little more. but it is risky, it does increase the chance of the other team scoring too. so prevent defense results in better overall defense and less opportunity to score for both teams. grab defense results in better scoring chance for both teams. the best defenders can not only easily switch between the two, but also know when to.  you definitely want to defuse bombs in base. bombs and boosts that can be directly used to grab flag are called offensive weapons and should be defused by the defense whenever possible (which is much easier to do when playing grab defense because the other team isn't in base as often).   I dont know what you mean there, but something similar to that is when the offense takes a defensive boost to get back to the other base. that irks me. a defensive boost is a team boost pointing out of base that the defense can use in case the flag gets out of base (think of the team boost in Boombox). ik its not what you're talking about, but i can't tell u how much that annoys me."
TagPro,3dntlm,NachosWithBeans,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:40:55 2015 UTC,"One downside to letting them grab, and popping them, is it sends them back to their base, to play defense against your teammates who are trying to grab the flag."
TagPro,3dntlm,Ronding,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:58:23 2015 UTC,"Which is why you should do it after your team grabbed their flag already. Then you get the upside of incrementing the number of enemies your flag carrier has passed. In this situation, it is even beneficial to push enemies onto your flag so that they are forced to grab and you can pop them."
TagPro,3dntlm,gryts,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:36:02 2015 UTC,bomb and boost defense is fine if the only outcome is kill or be in position to contain.
TagPro,3dntlm,__redruM,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:36:23 2015 UTC,"The problem with prevent is that when your offensive player is returning with the flag, they get killed.  Ideally you allow a grab if you can pop them easily.  Pinching between two defenders is best."
TagPro,3dntlm,SocialIssuesAhoy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:58:01 2015 UTC,"I've never played competitively, or even pickup so maybe I'm not ""experienced enough"" to answer this, but I play almost exclusively defense and I think I'm really good at it. Here's my thoughts:  The offense will ALWAYS grab eventually. It's inevitable. And in my experience, when a defender is playing prevent and offense gets a grab, they're usually in a good position to get away because the defensive player was entirely focused on butting up against the offender. They basically get caught on the wrong foot.  I let them grab because at this point I have a pretty instinctive feel for everybody's momentum as the play progresses. I also have a good feel for every map (except when they're new to me of course) and how to guide the FC to where I want them. My defensive game is much better that way.  There's a couple other benefits too. First, it can do wonders to the other team's morale. If they're butting heads that's bad enough, but if they feel like every grab attempt is futile, they get desperate and desperate players make more mistakes.  The other benefit is statistics: the more often you pop the enemy players, the less play-time they have. It's a short power play every time."

In a 1v1, defense in harder, because it is harder to contain alone, so you are basically playing a guessing game."

When you grab the flag, you can go anywhere, as long as the defense isn't there. Additionally, any mistake you make (like failing to escape a contain) will usually result in you respawning and coming back as if nothing happened.  However, when on defense, you must contain the fc PERFECTLY and anticipate his movements, or he will be out. Your mistakes can often turn into easy caps for the other team. Defense also has to worry about diffusing bombs, enemy pups, etc."

Or someone using neomacros like snaps commented above. Or even someone just manually typing out ""Left pup : 48"" or something like that?  It seems you may just be referencing standard macros which have been used by many players for a long time and are perfectly legal in both pubs and competitive play. As an in game moderator, I must recommend you not report for this. There has been some debate in the past about whether macros should be legal (mostly in competitive play) and the resounding majority have no problem with it. Of course, ideally all players having certain macros would be an option directly implemented on the main TagPro website as opposed to having to install a user script but that is all up to the devs and likely won't be implemented any time soon, if ever, at least until TagPro Next."

TagPro,3dqcax,FaithNHumanityStatus,2,Sat Jul 18 13:47:18 2015 UTC,"No problem! Never hurts to ask.  Macros can be very helpful to your team by not only calling out power-ups but letting your team know where the enemy FC is, if you're on regrab, if you need regrab, if base is clear for your FC to come in, etc. It's obviously a hell of a lot easier to press one key to send a specified message than it would be to pause your in game movements to type out a message and very likely put your team at a disadvantage.

Deconstructive rationalism holds that narrative must come from the masses, but only if consciousness is interchangeable with art.  In the works of Eco, a predominant concept is the distinction between within and without. Thus, an abundance of theories concerning a self-justifying reality exist. In The Island of the Day Before, Eco examines Lyotardist narrative; in The Limits of Interpretation (Advances in Semiotics), however, he denies pretextual construction.  If one examines the subdialectic paradigm of discourse, one is faced with a choice: either reject Lyotardist narrative or conclude that society has objective value. It could be said that any number of theories concerning Derridaist reading may be discovered. Marx’s analysis of structural neosemanticist theory states that truth is used to entrench hierarchy.  The primary theme of the works of Eco is not sublimation, as Sartre would have it, but presublimation. However, the characteristic theme of Long’s [1] critique of the subdialectic paradigm of discourse is the common ground between consciousness and sexual identity. Lacan suggests the use of Lyotardist narrative to analyse and attack society.  “Sexuality is part of the futility of truth,” says Bataille. Thus, Debord uses the term ‘capitalist theory’ to denote a mythopoetical totality. The subject is interpolated into a Derridaist reading that includes art as a reality.  It could be said that the primary theme of the works of Eco is the difference between class and society. The subject is contextualised into a postpatriarchial narrative that includes narrativity as a whole.  In a sense, von Ludwig[2] suggests that we have to choose between Derridaist reading and neodialectic discourse. Sartre uses the term ‘Lyotardist narrative’ to denote the collapse, and some would say the fatal flaw, of textual sexual identity.  Thus, if Derridaist reading holds, we have to choose between Lyotardist narrative and the subsemantic paradigm of narrative. The characteristic theme of McElwaine’s[3] essay on the subdialectic paradigm of discourse is not desublimation, but neodesublimation.  But Dahmus[4] holds that the works of Eco are not postmodern. Derrida promotes the use of capitalist theory to challenge the status quo.  In a sense, if Derridaist reading holds, we have to choose between the subdialectic paradigm of discourse and postmaterialist narrative. In The Moor’s Last Sigh, Rushdie reiterates Lyotardist narrative; in The Ground Beneath Her Feet, although, he analyses cultural prestructural theory.  But the premise of Lyotardist narrative suggests that class, somewhat surprisingly, has intrinsic meaning. The subject is interpolated into a Derridaist reading that includes culture as a paradox.  However, the primary theme of the works of Rushdie is the paradigm, and thus the collapse, of textual society. Sartre uses the term ‘Lyotardist narrative’ to denote the bridge between sexual identity and language.  2) The subdialectic paradigm of discourse and the neodeconstructive paradigm of discourse  “Sexual identity is used in the service of class divisions,” says Bataille; however, according to Finnis[5] , it is not so much sexual identity that is used in the service of class divisions, but rather the rubicon, and subsequent absurdity, of sexual identity. Therefore, capitalist socialism implies that the law is capable of significance, but only if the premise of Derridaist reading is valid; if that is not the case, sexuality is part of the economy of narrativity. The characteristic theme of Tilton’s [6] analysis of Lyotardist narrative is a postcultural reality.  “Class is fundamentally dead,” says Marx. In a sense, the subject is contextualised into a neodeconstructive paradigm of discourse that includes reality as a whole. A number of dematerialisms concerning the collapse, and eventually the defining characteristic, of capitalist society exist.  Therefore, Humphrey[7] states that the works of Fellini are an example of mythopoetical feminism. If Lyotardist narrative holds, we have to choose between Derridaist reading and precultural socialism.  It could be said that the primary theme of the works of Fellini is the role of the writer as artist. Any number of theories concerning the neodeconstructive paradigm of discourse may be revealed.  In a sense, the main theme of Bailey’s[8] essay on postcultural nihilism is a dialectic reality. De Selby[9] suggests that we have to choose between Lyotardist narrative and the prematerialist paradigm of consensus.  Therefore, the subject is interpolated into a neodeconstructive paradigm of discourse that includes truth as a paradox. A number of destructuralisms concerning not narrative, as Lyotardist narrative suggests, but postnarrative exist.  3) Expressions of stasis  If one examines the neodeconstructive paradigm of discourse, one is faced with a choice: either accept textual feminism or conclude that the establishment is capable of truth. But Derrida uses the term ‘Lyotardist narrative’ to denote the common ground between class and narrativity. The fatal flaw of Derridaist reading depicted in Fellini’s Amarcord is also evident in La Dolce Vita, although in a more mythopoetical sense.  It could be said that Sontag uses the term ‘the neodeconstructive paradigm of discourse’ to denote the role of the participant as artist. Many sublimations concerning the neocultural paradigm of reality may be discovered.  Therefore, the subject is contextualised into a neodeconstructive paradigm of discourse that includes language as a reality. If Lyotardist narrative holds, we have to choose between Batailleist `powerful communication’ and conceptual precapitalist theory.  Bibliography    Long, M.

TagPro,3dkpmj,GhengopelALPHA,4,Fri Jul 17 05:00:00 2015 UTC,"Discourses of Fatal flaw: Postcapitalist narrative, capitalism and social realism  By: Raven    1. Eco and Foucaultist power relations  The main theme of Drucker’s analysis of dialectic postcapitalist theory is the role of the writer as reader. In Foucault’s Pendulum, Eco reiterates Marxist capitalism; in The Limits of Interpretation (Advances in Semiotics), although, he analyses dialectic postcapitalist theory.  If one examines social realism, one is faced with a choice: either accept Foucaultist power relations or conclude that the purpose of the observer is deconstruction, given that the premise of dialectic postcapitalist theory is valid. Therefore, Sontag uses the term ‘social realism’ to denote the futility, and subsequent rubicon, of conceptualist society. The characteristic theme of the works of Eco is the role of the reader as writer.  However, Bataille suggests the use of the neodialectic paradigm of consensus to deconstruct capitalism. The main theme of Dahmus’s critique of Foucaultist power relations is the bridge between class and sexual identity.  Thus, an abundance of narratives concerning structuralist nationalism exist. The subject is contextualised into a social realism that includes art as a paradox.  But Marx promotes the use of subtextual desituationism to analyse and challenge society. The example of dialectic postcapitalist theory depicted in Pynchon’s Gravity’s Rainbow emerges again in Vineland, although in a more mythopoetical sense.  Therefore, Foucault suggests the use of social realism to deconstruct sexism. Dialectic objectivism holds that sexual identity, surprisingly, has significance.  2. Social realism and preconceptual theory  The characteristic theme of the works of Pynchon is a cultural whole. In a sense, a number of deconstructions concerning the futility of submodernist class may be discovered. The subject is interpolated into a Foucaultist power relations that includes narrativity as a paradox.  Therefore, la Tournier states that the works of Pynchon are postmodern. Many materialisms concerning social realism exist.  However, if preconceptual theory holds, we have to choose between textual neocapitalist theory and Sartreist existentialism. The main theme of Werther’s essay on Foucaultist power relations is a self-justifying reality.  3. Expressions of economy  If one examines social realism, one is faced with a choice: either reject dialectic postcapitalist theory or conclude that the collective is part of the collapse of language, but only if truth is interchangeable with sexuality; if that is not the case, we can assume that context comes from the collective unconscious. Thus, Lyotard uses the term ‘Foucaultist power relations’ to denote the role of the reader as artist. The premise of social realism holds that the goal of the poet is social comment.  In the works of Gibson, a predominant concept is the concept of dialectic consciousness. Therefore, an abundance of narratives concerning not desublimation, as Baudrillard would have it, but neodesublimation may be revealed. In Idoru, Gibson examines the subcapitalist paradigm of narrative; in Count Zero, however, he deconstructs preconceptual theory.  If one examines Foucaultist power relations, one is faced with a choice: either accept preconceptual theory or conclude that society has objective value. In a sense, Foucault promotes the use of Foucaultist power relations to read sexual identity. Constructivist narrative suggests that discourse is created by the masses, but only if Derrida’s model of preconceptual theory is invalid; otherwise, art may be used to reinforce capitalism.  It could be said that Bataille suggests the use of social realism to challenge the status quo. Preconceptual theory states that the purpose of the reader is deconstruction, given that consciousness is equal to sexuality.  However, Lacan uses the term ‘Foucaultist power relations’ to denote the difference between class and truth. Many deconstructions concerning neotextual semanticism exist.  But Lyotard uses the term ‘social realism’ to denote the role of the writer as reader. The subject is contextualised into a preconceptual theory that includes language as a totality.  In a sense, the characteristic theme of the works of Gibson is not narrative, but postnarrative. Derrida promotes the use of Foucaultist power relations to analyse and modify society."

TagPro,3dkpmj,ptgkbgte,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:28:56 2015 UTC,"In mathematics and physics, n-dimensional anti-de Sitter space is a maximally symmetric Lorentzian manifold with constant negative scalar curvature. It is the Lorentzian analogue of hyperbolic space, just as Minkowski space is the analogues of Euclidean space and de Sitter space is the analogue of elliptical space. In the language of general relativity, anti-de Sitter space is a maximally symmetric vacuum solution of Einstein's field equation with a negative (attractive) cosmological constant, corresponding to a negative energy density and positive pressure of the vacuum. The conformal boundary of asymptotically anti-de Sitter space differs dramatically from that of asymptotically flat spacetimes, and this feature is usually crucial whenever anti-de Sitter space appears in mathematical physics. Notable examples are Friedrich’s treatment of isolated systems in GR, the BTZ black holes, and also various studies in supersymmetry and string theory."

I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.  First class, yo this is bad Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass. Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmmmmm this might be alright.  But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think so I'll see when I get there I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air  Well, the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out I ain't trying to get arrested yet I just got here I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared  I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, home to Bel Air'  I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo home smell ya later' I looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air"

TagPro,3dkpmj,minniewheats,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:42:29 2015 UTC,"When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.  He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.  He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.  He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.  He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.  He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.  He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.  He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.  He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.  He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.  He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.  He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.  He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.  He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:  For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:  For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:  For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:  For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:  For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:  For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:  For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies  For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:  For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.  He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.  He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.  He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.  He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.  He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.  In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.  Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.  We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. — And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor."

TagPro,3dkpmj,bladerunner57,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:28:58 2015 UTC,"I.  So, there's a man crawling through the desert. He'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family, his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few friends had no idea he was out here. He stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in last. He thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So, he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the direction he thinks is right. He walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst. He pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark. By the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours. That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of these hills, and that'll be all he needs. As it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things, he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights. Full dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars. He wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the night before because he'd been in his car. He knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures, unless he finds water, this is his last day. He rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid. Then he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no idea what to do. Looking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat to the left of that, and starts walking. As he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first, and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke. He decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle. He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to make some difference and keep himself from passing out. He's quit worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him, it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that. He walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills, dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water. Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds, lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's careful to stay away from the movements. After a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep going. After more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it, trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town. He was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out. He walks through the sand. After a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad. But, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune. Halfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees. While crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines, if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape - shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it hurts. He finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top, he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close enough. Again, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand. At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from here. He's going to have to go down there and look."

TagPro,3dkpmj,slothbear,0,Fri Jul 17 02:13:06 2015 UTC,"II.  He puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune. After a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps, he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face with his hands, and waits to stop rolling. He stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it. So, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last chance. He gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just keeps crawling. Finally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it - a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center, where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone area. His mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun overhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying down on the nice cool surface. Cool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him a drink. Then he'll know he's gone. He decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the center before he goes. He keeps crawling. It's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's hearing. He would swear that someone just said, ""Greetings, traveler. You do not look well. Do you hear me?"" He stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and knees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something different - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands and tries again. Better this time. Yep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet out of the stone, at an angle. And wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him. He stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to move from this spot. Well, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes. Hmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet - that was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all. He then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here because he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was likely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was now on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake was even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting. He tries to clear his throat to say, ""Hello,"" but his throat is too dry. All that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out, almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't good. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes out. He gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips, and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk now. He tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to spot the owner of this place, and croaks out, ""Hello? Is there anyone here?"" He hears, from his side, ""Greetings. What is it that you want?"" He turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides to try asking for help. ""Please,"" he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, ""I'd love to not be thirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?"" Looking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its mouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he falls forward, face first on the stone, ""Very well. Coming up."" A piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped around the tilted white post, still looking at him. He reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet. He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes - they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been bitten. By the snake. ""It'll feel better in a minute."" He looks up - it's the snake talking. He hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more importantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all! ""Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the afterlife?"" ""Sorry about that, but I had to bite you,"" says the snake. ""That's the way I work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine."" ""You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be thirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk? Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?"" ""No,"" says the snake, ""I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just sitting around here."" The man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer dying of thirst. ""I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your system with the next request,"" continued the snake. ""I can guess why you drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or two, if you drank enough of it."" ""Ummm, n-next request?"" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting shoulder and backed away from the snake a little. ""That's the way it works. If you like, that is,"" explained the snake. ""You get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish."" The snake grinned at his own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs. ""But there are rules,"" the snake continued. ""The first request is free. The second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of responsibility."" The snake looks at the man seriously."
TagPro,3dkpmj,slothbear,-1,Fri Jul 17 04:07:30 2015 UTC,"III.  ""By the way,"" the snake says suddenly, ""my name is Nathan. Old Nathan, Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound used to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into names. You can call me Nate, if you wish."" Again, the snake grinned. ""Sorry if I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds somewhat threatening."" The snake give his rattle a little shake. ""Umm, my name is Jack,"" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. ""Jack Samson. ""Can I ask you a question?"" Jack says suddenly. ""What happened to the poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that? What do you mean by that's how you work?"" ""That's more than one question,"" grins Nate. ""But I'll still try to answer all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question."" The snake's grin gets wider. ""Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need to drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not be thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert. You've been changed. ""For the third question,"" Nate continues, ""you are still dying. Besides the effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal. In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years. Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is."" Nate seemed vastly amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin. ""As for the fourth question,"" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, ""first you have to agree to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell you."" ""Wait,"" joked Jack, ""isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd have to kill me?"" ""I thought that was implied."" Nate continued to look serious. ""Ummm...yeah."" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was talking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a nasty temper. ""So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really stop the effects of the methanol?"" Jack thought for a second. ""And, what do you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper fluid, and just denature it?"" ""They may, I don't really know,"" said Nate. ""I haven't gotten out in a while. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and on that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you pulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume that they still color wiper fluid blue?"" ""Yeah, they do,"" said Jack. ""I figured,"" replied Nate. ""As for being bound by secrecy - with the fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me, this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me, write about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will lead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding anyway, so you won't notice."" Nate said the last part with utter confidence. Jack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a little nervous at this. ""Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?"" Well, Jack,"" said Nate sadly, ""I can't tell you that, unless you make the second request."" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back. ""Umm, well, ok,"" said Jack, ""what is this about a second request? What can I ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?"" ""Sure!"" said Nate, brightening. ""You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes to yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and before you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or omnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous and yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and sort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be omniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very useful, at least in my opinion."" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was staring at him. ""Well, anyway,"" continued Nate, ""I'd probably suggest giving you permanent good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long time, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to recover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a request to me."" ""Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?"" said Jack. ""And keep me healthy for a long time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request about a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not really a change to me?"" ""Right,"" nodded Nate. ""Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?"" Jack asked, hopefully. ""That takes two requests, Jack."" ""Yeah, I figured so,"" said Jack. ""But I could ask to be a genius? I could become the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?"" ""Well, I could make you very smart,"" admitted Nate, ""but that wouldn't necessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you very athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either. You've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some truth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It all depends on what you decide to do with it."" ""Hmmm,"" said Jack. ""Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request, after this one?"" ""Maybe,"" said Nate, ""it depends on what you decide then. There are more rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second request. You know how it goes."" Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had shoulders. ""Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent health doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially. Do I need to sign in blood or something?"" ""No,"" said Nate. ""Just hold out your hand. Or heel."" Nate grinned. ""Or whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said, that's how it works - the poison, you know,"" Nate said apologetically. Jack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it didn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better about the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot snake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to be able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack tried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it wouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy. ""Hey, Jack,"" Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind him, ""is that someone else coming up over there?"" Jack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of nowhere? And did they bring food? Wait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate... Jack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through his jeans... Jack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. ""I would have decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to hoodwink me like that."" ""I've been doing this a long time, Jack,"" said Nate, confidently. ""You humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you - especially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of minutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the health benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now."" ""Yeah, well, still,"" said Jack, ""it's the principle of the thing. And nobody likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or something instead?"" ""More meat in the typical human butt,"" replied Nate. ""And less chance you accidentally kick me or move at the last second."""
TagPro,3dkpmj,slothbear,-1,Fri Jul 17 05:13:15 2015 UTC,"IV.  ""Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify to hear,"" answered Jack. ""Ok,"" said Nate. ""Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to just start talking?"" ""Just talk,"" said Jack. ""I'll sit here and try to not think about food."" ""We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,"" answered Nate. ""Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!"" Jack jumped up. ""What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically whip up food along with your other powers?"" Jack was almost shouting with excitement. His stomach had been growling for hours. ""I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite it for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife, that is,"" replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to. ""Ugh,"" said Jack, sitting back down. ""I think I'll pass. I can last a little longer before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it is you find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw. No thanks. Just talk."" ""Ok,"" replied Nate, still grinning. ""But I'd better hurry, before you start looking at me as food. Nate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued. ""You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden."" Jack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate sceptically. ""Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack,"" said Nate. ""Stand up and look at the symbol on the rock here."" Nate gestured around the dark stone they were both sitting on with his nose. Jack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a representation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around was coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches left the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it looked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and embedded in the stone than it did like a carving. Jack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the setting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the sky. Wait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another night out here! Arrrgh! Jack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and stood next to Nate. ""In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate,"" said Jack. ""Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to have to head back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw desert critters for long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to."" ""It's about 30 miles that way."" Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail this time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to the way he'd been going when he was crawling here. ""But that's 30 miles by the way the crow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be able to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head out early tomorrow, Jack."" Jack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and then sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading out right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting stuff. ""Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?"" ""Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway,"" said Nate. ""He figured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a 'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he could never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from across the ocean. He worried about that for a while."" ""Garden of Eden, hunh?"" said Jack. ""How long have you been here, Nate?"" ""No idea, really,"" replied Nate. ""A long time. It never occurred to me to count years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I do remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands of years, at least."" ""So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?"" said Jack. ""Beats me,"" said Nate. ""Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your kind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it could have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant requests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals."" ""Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out of the stone there?"" asked Jack. ""Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much bigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember if it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But one day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do something for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've been here ever since. ""What is this place?"" said Jack. ""And what did he ask you to do?"" ""Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?"" Nate loosened his coils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into the stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to enter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned over and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as Jack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but Nate was suddenly there in the way. ""You can't touch that yet, Jack,"" said Nate. ""Why not?"" asked Jack. ""I haven't explained it to you yet,"" replied Nate. ""Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something,"" said Jack. ""You'd push it that way, and it would move in the slot."" ""Yep, that's what it is,"" replied Nate. ""What does it do?"" asked Jack. ""End the world?"" ""Oh, no,"" said Nate. ""Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it 'The Lever of Doom'."" For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing voice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and grinned. Jack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned Jack laughed. ""Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it really do?"" ""Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said,"" smirked Nate. ""I just thought the voice I used was funny, didn't you?"" Nate continued to grin. ""A lever to end humanity?"" asked Jack. ""What in the world is that for? Why would anyone need to end humanity?"" ""Well,"" replied Nate, ""I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment. Or maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really bad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are the rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I didn't think to ask back when I started here."" ""Rules? What rules?"" asked Jack. ""The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it unless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human can be bound in that way at a time. That's it."" explained Nate. Jack looked somewhat shocked. ""You mean that I could pull the lever now? You'd let me end humanity?"" ""Yep,"" replied Nate, ""if you want to."" Nate looked at Jack carefully. ""Do you want to, Jack?"" ""Umm, no."" said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. ""Why in the world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want that! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too, wouldn't it?"" ""Yep,"" replied Nate, ""being as he'd be human too."" ""Has anyone ever seriously considered it?"" asked Nate. ""Any of those bound to secrecy, that is?"""
TagPro,3dkpmj,slothbear,0,Fri Jul 17 02:14:51 2015 UTC,"V.  ""Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or another. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and think, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get disgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while. But he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here."" Nate grinned some more. Jack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at the same time. After a bit, he said, ""So this makes me the Judge of humanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?"" ""That seems to be it,"" agreed Nate. ""What kind of criteria do I use to decide?"" said Jack. ""How do I make this decision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are bad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?"" ""Nope,"" replied Nate. ""You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's up to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed to know."" ""But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel horrible? Couldn't I make a mistake? How do I know that I won't screw up?"" protested Jack. Nate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. ""You don't. You just have to try your best, Jack."" Jack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly getting dark, chewing on a fingernail. Suddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. ""Nate, was Samuel the one bound to this before me?"" ""Yep,"" replied Nate. ""He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to read and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried in the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months ago."" ""Sounds like a good guy,"" agreed Jack. ""How did he handle this, when you first told him. What did he do?"" ""Well,"" said Nate, ""he sat down for a while, thought about it for a bit, and then asked me some questions, much like you're doing."" ""What did he ask you, if you're allowed to tell me?"" asked Jack. ""He asked me about the third request,"" replied Nate. ""Aha!"" It was Jack's turn to grin. ""And what did you tell him?"" ""I told him the rules for the third request. That to get the third request you have to agree to this whole thing. That if it ever comes to the point that you really think that humanity should be ended, that you'll come here and end it. You won't avoid it, and you won't wimp out."" Nate looked serious again. ""And you'll be bound to do it too, Jack."" ""Hmmm."" Jack looked back out into the darkness for a while. Nate watched him, waiting. ""Nate,"" continued Jack, quietly, eventually. ""What did Samuel ask for with his third request?"" Nate sounded like he was grinning again as he replied, also quietly, ""Wisdom, Jack. He asked for wisdom. As much as I could give him."" ""Ok,"" said Jack, suddenly, standing up and facing away from Nate, ""give it to me. Nate looked at Jack's backside. ""Give you what, Jack?"" ""Give me that wisdom. The same stuff that Samuel asked for. If it helped him, maybe it'll help me too."" Jack turned his head to look back over his shoulder at Nate. ""It did help him, right?"" ""He said it did,"" replied Nate. ""But he seemed a little quieter afterward. Like he had a lot to think about."" ""Well, yeah, I can see that,"" said Jack. ""So, give it to me."" Jack turned to face away from Nate again, bent over slightly and tensed up. Nate watched Jack tense up with a little exasperation. If he bit Jack now, Jack would likely jump out of his skin and maybe hurt them both. ""You remember that you'll be bound to destroy humanity if it ever looks like it needs it, right Jack?"" asked Nate, shifting position. ""Yeah, yeah, I got that,"" replied Jack, eyes squeezed tightly shut and body tense, not noticing the change in direction of Nate's voice. ""And,"" continued Nate, from his new position, ""do you remember that you'll turn bright purple, and grow big horns and extra eyes?"" ""Yeah, yeah...Hey, wait a minute!"" said Jack, opening his eyes, straightening up and turning around. ""Purple?!"" He didn't see Nate there. With the moonlight Jack could see that the lever extended up from its slot in the rock without the snake wrapped around it. Jack heard, from behind him, Nate's ""Just Kidding!"" right before he felt the now familiar piercing pain, this time in the other buttock. Jack sat on the edge of the dark stone in the rapidly cooling air, his feet extending out into the sand. He stared out into the darkness, listening to the wind stir the sand, occasionally rubbing his butt where he'd been recently bitten. Nate had left for a little while, had come back with a desert-rodent-shaped bulge somewhere in his middle, and was now wrapped back around the lever, his tongue flicking out into the desert night's air the only sign that he was still awake. Occasionally Jack, with his toes absentmindedly digging in the sand while he thought, would ask Nate a question without turning around. ""Nate, do accidents count?"" Nate lifted his head a little bit. ""What do you mean, Jack?"" Jack tilted his head back like he was looking at the stars. ""You know, accidents. If I accidentally fall on the lever, without meaning to, does that still wipe out humanity?"" ""Yeah, I'm pretty sure it does, Jack. I'd suggest you be careful about that if you start feeling wobbly,"" said Nate with some amusement. A little later - ""Does it have to be me that pulls the lever?"" asked Jack. ""That's the rule, Jack. Nobody else can pull it,"" answered Nate. ""No,"" Jack shook his head, ""I meant does it have to be my hand? Could I pull the lever with a rope tied around it? Or push it with a stick? Or throw a rock?"" ""Yes, those should work,"" replied Nate. ""Though I'm not sure how complicated you could get. Samuel thought about trying to build some kind of remote control for it once, but gave it up. Everything he'd build would be gone by the next sunrise, if it was touching the stone, or over it. I told him that in the past others that had been bound had tried to bury the lever so they wouldn't be tempted to pull it, but every time the stones or sand or whatever had disappeared."" ""Wow,"" said Jack, ""Cool."" Jack leaned back until only his elbows kept him off of the stone and looked up into the sky. ""Nate, how long did Samuel live? One of his wishes was for health too, right?"" asked Jack. ""Yes,"" replied Nate, ""it was. He lived 167 years, Jack."" ""Wow, 167 years. That's almost 140 more years I'll live if I live as long. Do you know what he died of, Nate?"" ""He died of getting tired of living, Jack,"" Nate said, sounding somewhat sad. Jack turned his head to look at Nate in the starlight. Nate looked back. ""Samuel knew he wasn't going to be able to stay in society. He figured that they'd eventually see him still alive and start questioning it, so he decided that he'd have to disappear after a while. He faked his death once, but changed his mind - he decided it was too early and he could stay for a little longer. He wasn't very fond of mankind, but he liked the attention. Most of the time, anyway. ""His daughter and then his wife dying almost did him in though. He didn't stay in society much longer after that. He eventually came out here to spend time talking to me and thinking about pulling the lever. A few months ago he told me he'd had enough. It was his time."" ""And then he just died?"" asked Jack. Nate shook his head a little. ""He made his forth request, Jack. There's only one thing you can ask for the fourth request. The last bite. After a bit Nate continued, ""He told me that he was tired, that it was his time. He reassured me that someone new would show up soon, like they always had. After another pause, Nate finished, ""Samuel's body disappeared off the stone with the sunrise."" Jack lay back down and looked at the sky, leaving Nate alone with his memories. It was a long time until Jack's breathing evened out into sleep. Jack woke with the sunrise the next morning. He was a little chilled with the morning desert air, but overall was feeling pretty good. Well, except that his stomach was grumbling and he wasn't willing to eat raw desert rat. So, after getting directions to town from Nate, making sure he knew how to get back, and reassuring Nate that he'd be back soon, Jack started the long walk back to town. With his new health and Nate's good directions, he made it back easily."
TagPro,3dkpmj,slothbear,-1,Fri Jul 17 02:15:42 2015 UTC,"VI.  Jack caught a bus back to the city, and showed up for work the next day, little worse for the wear and with a story about getting lost in the desert and walking back out. Within a couple of days Jack had talked a friend with a tow truck into going back out into the desert with him to fetch the SUV. They found it after a couple of hours of searching and towed it back without incident. Jack was careful not to even look in the direction of Nate's lever, though their path back didn't come within sight of it. Before the next weekend, Jack had gone to a couple of stores, including a book store, and had gotten his SUV back from the mechanic, with a warning to avoid any more joyriding in the desert. On Saturday, Jack headed back to see Nate. Jack parked a little way out of the small town near Nate, loaded up his new backpack with camping gear and the things he was bringing for Nate, and then started walking. He figured that walking would leave the least trail, and he knew that while not many people camped in the desert, it wasn't unheard of, and shouldn't really raise suspicions. Jack had brought more books for Nate - recent books, magazines, newspapers. Some things that would catch Nate up with what was happening in the world, others that were just good books to read. He spent the weekend with Nate, and then headed out again, telling Nate that he'd be back again soon, but that he had things to do first. Over four months later Jack was back to see Nate again. This time he brought a laptop with him - a specially modified laptop. It had a solar recharger, special filters and seals to keep out the sand, a satellite link-up, and a special keyboard and joystick that Jack hoped that a fifteen-foot rattlesnake would be able to use. And, it had been hacked to not give out its location to the satellite. After that Jack could e-mail Nate to keep in touch, but still visited him fairly regularly - at least once or twice a year. After the first year, Jack quit his job. For some reason, with the wisdom he 'd been given, and the knowledge that he could live for over 150 years, working in a nine to five job for someone else didn't seem that worthwhile any more. Jack went back to school. Eventually, Jack started writing. Perhaps because of the wisdom, or perhaps because of his new perspective, he wrote well. People liked what he wrote, and he became well known for it. After a time, Jack bought an RV and started traveling around the country for book signings and readings. But, he still remembered to drop by and visit Nate occasionally. On one of the visits Nate seemed quieter than usual. Not that Nate had been a fountain of joy lately. Jack's best guess was that Nate was still missing Samuel, and though Jack had tried, he still hadn't been able to replace Samuel in Nate's eyes. Nate had been getting quieter each visit. But on this visit Nate didn't even speak when Jack walked up to the lever. He nodded at Jack, and then went back to staring into the desert. Jack, respecting Nate's silence, sat down and waited. After a few minutes, Nate spoke. ""Jack, I have someone to introduce you to."" Jack looked surprised. ""Someone to introduce me to?"" Jack looked around, and then looked carefully back at Nate. ""This something to do with the Big Guy? ""No, no,"" replied Nate. ""This is more personal. I want you to meet my son."" Nate looked over at the nearest sand dune. ""Sammy!"" Jack watched as a four foot long desert rattlesnake crawled from behind the dune and up to the stone base of the lever. ""Yo, Jack,"" said the new, much smaller snake. ""Yo, Sammy"" replied Jack. Jack looked at Nate. ""Named after Samuel, I assume?"" Nate nodded. ""Jack, I've got a favor to ask you. Could you show Sammy around for me?"" Nate unwrapped himself from the lever and slithered over to the edge of the stone and looked across the sands. ""When Samuel first told me about the world, and brought me books and pictures, I wished that I could go see it. I wanted to see the great forests, the canyons, the cities, even the other deserts, to see if they felt and smelled the same. I want my son to have that chance - to see the world. Before he becomes bound here like I have been. ""He's seen it in pictures, over the computer that you brought me. But I hear that it's not the same. That being there is different. I want him to have that. Think you can do that for me, Jack?"" Jack nodded. This was obviously very important to Nate, so Jack didn't even joke about taking a talking rattlesnake out to see the world. ""Yeah, I can do that for you, Nate. Is that all you need?"" Jack could sense that was something more. Nate looked at Sammy. Sammy looked back at Nate for a second and then said, ""Oh, yeah. Ummm, I've gotta go pack. Back in a little bit Jack. Nice to meet ya!"" Sammy slithered back over the dune and out of sight. Nate watched Sammy disappear and then looked back at Jack. ""Jack, this is my first son. My first offspring through all the years. You don't even want to know what it took for me to find a mate."" Nate grinned to himself. ""But anyway, I had a son for a reason. I'm tired. I'm ready for it to be over. I needed a replacement."" Jack considered this for a minute. ""So, you're ready to come see the world, and you wanted him to watch the lever while you were gone?"" Nate shook his head. ""No, Jack - you're a better guesser than that. You've already figured out - I'm bound here - there's only one way for me to leave here. And I'm ready. It's my time to die."" Jack looked more closely at Nate. He could tell Nate had thought about this - probably for quite a while. Jack had trouble imagining what it would be like to be as old as Nate, but Jack could already tell that in another hundred or two hundred years, he might be getting tired of life himself. Jack could understand Samuel's decision, and now Nate's. So, all Jack said was, ""What do you want me to do?"" Nate nodded. ""Thanks, Jack. I only want two things. One - show Sammy around the world - let him get his fill of it, until he's ready to come back here and take over. Two - give me the fourth request. ""I can't just decide to die, not any more than you can. I won't even die of old age like you eventually will, even though it'll be a long time from now. I need to be killed. Once Sammy is back here, ready to take over, I'll be able to die. And I need you to kill me. ""I've even thought about how. Poisons and other drugs won't work on me. And I've seen pictures of snakes that were shot - some of them live for days, so that's out too. So, I want you to bring back a sword. Nate turned away to look back to the dune that Sammy had gone behind. ""I'd say an axe, but that's somewhat undignified - putting my head on the ground or a chopping block like that. No, I like a sword. A time-honored way of going out. A dignified way to die. And, most importantly, it should work, even on me. ""You willing to do that for me, Jack?"" Nate turned back to look at Jack. ""Yeah, Nate,"" replied Jack solemnly, ""I think I can handle that."" Nate nodded. ""Good!"" He turned back toward the dune and shouted, ""Sammy! Jack's about ready to leave!"" Then quietly, ""Thanks, Jack."" Jack didn't have anything to say to that, so he waited for Sammy to make it back to the lever, nodded to him, nodded a final time to Nate, and then headed into the desert with Sammy following. Over the next several years Sammy and Jack kept in touch with Nate through e-mail as they went about their adventures. They made a goal of visiting every country in the world, and did a respectable job of it. Sammy had a natural gift for languages, as Jack expected he would, and even ended up acting as a translator for Jack in a few of the countries. Jack managed to keep the talking rattlesnake hidden, even so, and by the time they were nearing the end of their tour of countries, Sammy had only been spotted a few times. While there were several people that had seen enough to startle them greatly, nobody had enough evidence to prove anything, and while a few wild rumors and storied followed Jack and Sammy around, nothing ever hit the newspapers or the public in general. When they finished the tour of countries, Jack suggested that they try some undersea diving. They did. And spelunking. They did that too. Sammy finally drew the line at visiting Antarctica. He'd come to realize that Jack was stalling. After talking to his Dad about it over e-mail, he figured out that Jack probably didn't want to have to kill Nate. Nate told Sammy that humans could be squeamish about killing friends and acquaintances."
TagPro,3dkpmj,slothbear,-1,Fri Jul 17 02:16:20 2015 UTC,"VII.  So, Sammy eventually put his tail down (as he didn't have a foot) and told Jack that it was time - he was ready to go back and take up his duties from his dad. Jack, delayed it a little more by insisting that they go back to Japan and buy an appropriate sword. He even stretched it a little more by getting lessons in how to use the sword. But, eventually, he'd learned as much as he was likely to without dedicating his life to it, and was definitely competent enough to take the head off of a snake. It was time to head back and see Nate. When they got back to the US, Jack got the old RV out of storage where he and Sammy had left it after their tour of the fifty states, he loaded up Sammy and the sword, and they headed for the desert. When they got to the small town that Jack had been trying to find those years ago when he'd met Nate, Jack was in a funk. He didn't really feel like walking all of the way out there. Not only that, but he'd forgotten to figure the travel time correctly, and it was late afternoon. They'd either have to spend the night in town and walk out tomorrow, or walk in the dark. As Jack was afraid that if he waited one more night he might lose his resolve, he decided that he'd go ahead and drive the RV out there. It was only going to be this once, and Jack would go back and cover the tracks afterward. They ought to be able to make it out there by nightfall if they drove, and then they could get it over tonight. Jack told Sammy to e-mail Nate that they were coming as he drove out of sight of the town on the road. They then pulled off the road and headed out into the desert. Everything went well, until they got to the sand dunes. Jack had been nursing the RV along the whole time, over the rocks, through the creek beds, revving the engine the few times they almost got stuck. When they came to the dunes, Jack didn't really think about it, he just downshifted and headed up the first one. By the third dune, Jack started to regret that he'd decided to try driving on the sand. The RV was fishtailling and losing traction. Jack was having to work it up each dune slowly and was trying to keep from losing control each time they came over the top and slid down the other side. Sammy had come up to sit in the passenger seat, coiled up and laughing at Jack's driving. As they came over the top of the fourth dune, the biggest one yet, Jack saw that this was the final dune - the stone, the lever, and somewhere Nate, waited below. Jack put on the brakes, but he'd gone a little too far. The RV started slipping down the other side. Jack tried turning the wheel, but he didn't have enough traction. He pumped the brakes - no response. They started sliding down the hill, faster and faster. Jack felt a shock go through him as he suddenly realized that they were heading for the lever. He looked down - the RV was directly on course for it. If Jack didn't do something, the RV would hit it. He was about to end humanity. Jack steered more frantically, trying to get traction. It still wasn't working. The dune was too steep, and the sand too loose. In a split second, Jack realized that his only chance would be once he hit the stone around the lever - he should have traction on the stone for just a second before he hit the lever - he wouldn't have time to stop, but he should be able to steer away. Jack took a better grip on the steering wheel and tried to turn the RV a little bit - every little bit would help. He'd have to time his turn just right. The RV got to the bottom of the dune, sliding at an amazing speed in the sand. Just before they reached the stone Jack looked across it to check that they were still heading for the lever. They were. But Jack noticed something else that he hadn't seen from the top of the dune. Nate wasn't wrapped around the lever. He was off to the side of the lever, but still on the stone, waiting for them. The problem was, he was waiting on the same side of the lever that Jack had picked to steer towards to avoid the lever. The RV was already starting to drift that way a little in its mad rush across the sand and there was no way that Jack was going to be able to go around the lever to the other side. Jack had an instant of realization. He was either going to have to hit the lever, or run over Nate. He glanced over at Sammy and saw that Sammy realized the same thing. Jack took a firmer grip on the steering wheel as the RV ran up on the stone. Shouting to Sammy as he pulled the steering wheel, ""BETTER NATE THAN LEVER,"" he ran over the snake. THE END"

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.  But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."

TagPro,3dkpmj,SAPSAPSAPSPA,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:36:47 2015 UTC,"Espel's guide to getting better through pubs I see a lot of people talk in the subs about how PUBs is where you go to learn the basics of the game, and competitive stuff is how you get better. I disagree with this. PUBs are the best way to learn many skills because you get the most game time and you can do them any time. Have 10 minutes in the morning to get better before you have to go? Play a couple pubs. Have a couple hours? Playing pubs will give you 2 hours of gameplay, which you'll be hard-pressed to find on mumble. It gives you a great chance to practice specific skills and learn from mistakes. So change your display name, turn stats off, and get better. Here are some specific skills you can practice in pubs: GAME SENSE - To me, game sense is how much of a sense you have of what's going on in the entire map. When you play with some of the best players, sometimes it feels like they have a hack that lets them see the whole thing. This allows you to make correct decisions such as when to come towards base as the flag carrier, when you have to get on re, and when you can go for powerups. I use it most when I have the flag and I want to make sure I know where all four of their players are so I know where to go. Ideally being on a competitive team with communication will make up for a lot of this, but there is a lot of info to keep in mind and your team isn't going to tell you a lot of it. How to practice this in pubs - This is pretty simple. As you play, just try to keep track of where all 8 people are for as much of the game as you can. Keeping track of their players are more important than keeping track of your own. Remember, this is less about winning and more about practicing. Count and keep track of anyone dying or going off any side of the screen. Also keep watch of the flag icons near the bottom of the screen to see how many people have grabbed. If you have the flag and are going across the map to score, you might see one respawn shadow behind you, two flag icons pop up and immediately go away, and one guy directly in front of you. You know this means you just have to beat this one guy to cap, and that you have a decent amount of time to do so. Now you can plan accordingly. Game sense is super important but not something that's talked about very much. Get better at it and you will become a much better player and clearly separate yourself from everyone else in NLTP. BLOCKING - Blocking is good. Blocking is basically this - the person you are blocking wants to be in a specific spot, and wants the mobility to be able to move from that spot. Your goal in blocking is to not let them be in that spot, or, if they are, not let them move from it. Blocking is juking too. The offensive defensive is trying to juke you out to get more space and you are trying to mirror their jukes. The most important thing I can say about blocking is to narrow your focus to the 1 on 1 battle. It's a lot easier to read and mirror the person's jukes if you are staring directly at them, as opposed to looking at the bigger picture. It's a little riskier in that they might be able to get the flag out a little easier, or that you might not be ""blocking as a team"", but if you have two guys destroying their opponent it's not going to matter. How to practice in game - Just play defense, pick someone and bully them. Try to always force them to somewhere they don't want to go. Stare directly at them and work on reading where they're going. Then shut it down. If you let the block slip, just run over and try to set one again. Screw actual defense, you don't need that. Just make someone's life miserable. And try not to get banned. Eventually, after doing this your blocking should become better, you should find yourself playing ""stronger"" and the offensive defense will be pissed because they're in the corner being fucked when the flag is coming in. POWERUPS - There have been rumors that you guys aren't fantastic at powerups. They are, obviously, pretty important, and the best players can make their game fit around them and always remember them. This means more than thinking about them every minute. I think about them probably every 20 seconds or so. If I grab and die here, am I going to be able to get back in time to fight for the powerup? If I'm chasing, what powerup am I closest by and how much time is there until it? Stuff like that I dunno. They're important. How to practice in pubs If thinking about powerups is something you struggle with, then start out thinking about nothing but them. Again, this might not be the ideal game move, but make every single action with powerups in mind. Try to get a bunch of them and say out loud what time they're at. Practice having and being able to relay 2 or 3 powerup times at the same time. Practice your powerup communication even though you're just talking to yourself. It's easier than in a serious game when there's so much other info going on. Never grab when it could endanger you getting a powerup. Eventually, you should be able to better be able to keep exact powerup times going with your team, think about them in game more, and focus your game more around them. OTHER SHIT There's a bunch of other stuff you can practice of course with this general model but I think these are three of the biggest. When I first got mumble, I was already better than most minors players because I put a focus on teaching myself and getting better through pubs. With this guide maybe you can too. I dunno."

I like the league structure just fine as it currently is, with regular season matches followed by playoffs without any ""Cup"" distractions. The ""Cup"" seems redundant and unnecessary. I'm not really a big fan of dissolving the league hierarchy and lumping MLTP, mLTP, NLTP A, and NLTP B all together. The league is tiered the way it is for a reason.

Fair enough, maybe if it were to be Sunday-Saturday and lots of heads up beforehand this couldn't be as big of an issue.   You're trying to wedge a whole new concept into the existing league structure smack dab in the middle of the season.   Absolutely agree. I wouldn't mind it if mentioned in the beginning of the season, but it just seems like more work on short notice.   I'm not really a big fan of dissolving the league hierarchy and lumping MLTP, mLTP, NLTP A, and NLTP B all together. The league is tiered the way it is for a reason.   I'm not a fan of this point, because you know as well as I know that each season that there are players that play NLTP that obviously don't belong there (won't name names) and you know it, this season is no exception. Also if you ever watch Soccer league matches (i.e. FA Cup, Champions League, etc.) these tournaments are pretty damn successful and kinda flow with the regular season.   Kinda feels like this is stealing the thunder from USC Masters.   Not really considering USC Masters only really considers the upper-two tiers and doesn't really consider the lower tiers.   I see no reason to show our cards to opponents we might yet face in the actual MLTP season.   What and having your games streamed and recorded each week doesn't do this already? pls.   As a captain, I was never consulted about this.   Can't argue that one. I feel this came out of the blue and all captains from all leagues should be involved in the discussion.  My Point: This isn't an absolutely terrible idea, but to introduce it mid season and try to cram it down people's throats seems like a bit much.

I'd be further amazed if there were any material negatives to playing in this tournament. Name one legitimate downside to playing outside ""oh no our opponents can study 30 minutes of our footage"".  Your team already scrims at least 30 minutes a week right? Why not just go ask the other team to show up when you normally scrim and have fun for half an hour playing with a new team?  Now I'm gonna hit your actual points.   It takes 10 minutes max. I'll do it for you, even. This is a nonissue in my mind. Redundant? Unnecessary? It's supposed to be fun dude. This game and league thrives when the best teams are playing competitively. Adding more games is just awesome for everyone who enjoys playing and watching the game. I understand if your team just can't make it due to time constraints but even at the very least you can treat this as glorified practice. This dissolves nothing. It's an addition! It gives NLTP teams a shot to prove themselves and M/mLTP teams a shot to show that they are actually the cream of the crop. I'm happy to ask that nobody schedule during the same day as USCM. I'd gladly do it for you guys. I love USC and in fact we saw USCM go over so well we were hoping to keep the hype up once it finishes. I hope you're not legitimately upset about this but if you are, PM me. There are options. I think this is silly. However if I you played I'd be happy to ask that nobody stream it. If you also ended up scheduled against a team the same week you play them in M/mLTP we can look at ways to work around that. This wouldn't have happened if we let both leagues captains critique everything. You probably understand that from how USC is run.   I hope you reconsider, and at the very least I'd love if you just asked your team one more time if they would be up to play 30 minutes even for fun this week."

Name one legitimate downside to playing   Isn't it enough that my team doesn't want to play?   Why not just go ask the other team to show up when you normally scrim and have fun for half an hour playing with a new team?    The other team may not be available during the times we normally scrim.  You're acting like I would approach this like a scrim. I would not... because it's not a scrim. It's an officially sanctioned match. I'm competitive, and would want to prepare well to represent the Wild Pings well and do our best to win any competitive match. Intra-scrimming or scrimming majors teams is better practice than playing than NLTP B, NLTP A, or other minors squads.    It takes 10 minutes max. I'll do it for you, even. This is a nonissue in my mind.   Nah. Let me tell you something: in 100% of cases in the first 6 weeks of majors, I have been the first person to contact the opposing team and schedule our majors and minors matches, and in some cases their captain won't respond for days at a time. It's a hastle to do this for two additional matches, and even if it's just a small hastle, it's still unnecessary. And what if they can't play during our normal practice days? Suppose they normally practice and are only available on our off days, and now all of a sudden we're required to show up 6 days a week?    Redundant? Unnecessary? It's supposed to be fun dude. This game and league thrives when the best teams are playing competitively. Adding more games is just awesome for everyone who enjoys playing and watching the game. I understand if your team just can't make it due to time constraints but even at the very least you can treat this as glorified practice.   I already responded to the 'glorified practice' part above. But the more games the better? That's news. Hey, let's do another tournament on top of this! Why not play every day of the week!   Tbh it's not even that. It's the fact that this whole cup thing is just forced on top of the normal MLTP league structure out of nowhere. I rather like the system now: we prepare for two maps and one opponent a week, we practice on Tuesday and Thursday, and have our matches on Sunday and Monday. Sundays are special and hyped because that's when MLTP is. Wedging additional matches and a whole new concept into it just detracts from the MLTP narrative.   This dissolves nothing. It's an addition! It gives NLTP teams a shot to prove themselves and M/mLTP teams a shot to show that they are actually the cream of the crop.   Uh no, the fact is that it does dissolve league divisions.   I'm happy to ask that nobody schedule during the same day as USCM.   Yes, I'm a bit irked that this tournament steps on the toes of USCM, but whatever, it's not a big issue--or, as Drukqs so tactfully put it, I'm ""stupid for giving people shit"" about this.   If you also ended up scheduled against a team the same week you play them in M/mLTP we can look at ways to work around that   Like what?  And it's not even that. It's the fact that should you play them in the tournament and then have to play that team later in the actual MLTP season, it's like... that first match didn't count (for the actual MLTP league). Idk, to me, if you're playing the team in an official capacity, win or lose those results should stand. You don't get a mulligan.   This wouldn't have happened if we let both leagues captains critique everything.    This is a horrible argument. You can't just drop these things on us in the middle of the season and say ""I know this is going to directly affect all of you, but we didn't give a shit about your viewpoints and just wanted to push this through.""    What it boils down to is that I don't like this concept, and I doubly don't like the way it was forced on us out of blue in the middle of the damn season with zero warning or consultation. So I'd appreciate it if everybody would get off my back for withdrawing from a tournament I never signed up for in the first place."

Sarcasm aside, I always prefer transparency over non-transparency.   I understand, and in general transparency is a good thing.  But transparency doesn't always mean ""say anything and everything on my mind"" - you can be tactful while also being transparent.    For example, here is a comment you could have said which would have been transparent, and tactful:  ""I appreciate everyone here wanting to have fun and play in the tournament, but due to it being announced mid-way through the season, my team honestly doesn't have time to dedicate to something like this - maybe next season though! Looks like fun for the teams who will participate."""
TagPro,3dl863,quassus,2,Sun Jul 19 23:38:53 2015 UTC,"I feel bad for people on your team, they're missing out on extra competitive play in an unprecedented tournament because you, the captain, are pitching a fit about this.    Your minors team can schedule their own time, surely they have at least one grownup amongst them. And you can't schedule a single extra match in a week? Give me a break. Maybe MLTP leadership should reconsider your captaincy if scheduling a single extra game is so tough for you.  Should they do it between seasons when everybody will say ""I'm on my break from competitive play and don't have a team""? It would be infinitely harder to put together then.  Are you scared of losing to an NLTP B team or do you just think you're that much above them? Not wanting to play a team because they're in a different league is flimsy as hell.  USCM is still very separate from any other league or event, and it's stupid that you'd give people shit for organizing an event because it's ""stealing thunder"", discouraging projects or events in a community that thrives on them is ridiculous.  ""Showing your cards""? For real? Do you make your players sign NDAs too? That's gotta be the most laughably try-hard statement I've ever seen, dude, this is a game about balls capping flags and all your games are streamed, as TheBob already pointed out. It takes a special kind of paranoia to worry about other MLTP teams scouting you and learning all your moves in a Cup Tournament.  True, you weren't, because they probably want this to actually happen rather than sit in modmail purgatory for a year because of ridiculous excuses and bitching. This takes so little to get on board with, especially if you don't care about it and just do the bare minimum of showing up and playing an extra match."

Your condescension and acrimony was and is wholly uncalled for. I'm much more inclined to listen to an argument which is fair, unprejudiced, and respectful. Seriously, Drukqs, try to treat me like an adult. I think I deserve at least that much.  As for not wanting to ""show my cards"": you're lambasting me for this one point which is really just an afterthought anyway. Perhaps it would have served me better to phrase it thusly: I simply don't want to play a team in the cup and then have to turn around and play them again (or vice versa).  Let me boil it down. You like the cup idea. I am fine with you liking the cup idea. That's fine! Have a good time! I'll have fun watching all the teams compete! I do not like the cup idea. You are criticizing and attacking me for not liking the cup idea. Can't you just respect that we have differing opinions on it?

This is something that could've been handled in PMs or on Mumble, the only thing you serve by making a big deal out of your team's nonparticipating is to hurt the event's momentum and lay groundwork for other teams to bail and cause the whole thing to derail.   You don't like the cup idea and would rather not play in it? Cool, message the people putting it on and let them know. You're right, you have zero obligation to play in it, and if you don't want to then that's a bummer but oh well. IMO That's way better than any of your reasons in your original comment and could've been done discretely in a single PM. I'm not giving you shit for disliking an idea that I like, I'm giving you shit for how you went about communicating that opinion, which I felt was tactless, non-constructive, and unnecessary."
TagPro,3dl863,bobby_gordon1,-2,Sun Jul 19 04:27:11 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think it's important that instead of handling it all 'hush hush' behind closed doors I make a post in the relevant thread about it so that other people who are in the tournament know (and so I don't have people pming me to set matches up and such). It's not a ""public protest"", as you seem so bent on labeling it; it's just common courtesy to all concerned.  As for ""laying groundwork for other teams to bail"": that's entirely their own decision and their prerogative should they, like us, decide not to participate. If the concept is good enough on its own merit, it will retain teams' interest; if not, they will leave. But I doubt we'll see any sort of mass exodus like you seem to be worried about.  You think this post was unnecessary? Okay, next time I simply won't make this post, and then you and the rest of the tournament participants will be left wondering what in the world happened to the number one seed who mysteriously forfeited and it'll be nice for me because I won't have to deal with vitriolic personalities who can't cope with the fact that I made a PSA about not wanting to play in a tournament."

TagPro,3dngbn,dandeliondreamer,9,Fri Jul 17 19:07:27 2015 UTC,"The mid section of Pokeball is actually really interesting because controlling the buttons is crucial to a team winning, but, since the buttons are in the middle of the map, if you are occupying this area the whole game then you are then effectively playing a man down. It's very unique in that respect. The big problem is that the area at top and bottom of the map rivals the size of some small countries."

That may be a form of witchhunting so me, personally, am completely against it.   You never know context.   I rarely pub alone and have many friends/aquantances that I absolutely love shittalking to in pubs. I've been reported for calling my bestfriend/long defensive partner Ball Sac names. We're in mumble chatting but its fun to do it in game. I get reported, we all laugh.   FUCKING REPORT THEM TO IRC  That's the jist. We don't need a goddamn post every week about this. It's as simple as reporting them, going to irc, tell them your server, tell them the name. GET THEM FUCKING BANNED That is how this ends. Get every stupid motherfucker who makes stupid fucking jokes that are just down right offensive and wrong.   Any complaint I ever see about another player I will from now on ask ""Did you report it to IRC?"" If that answer is no then you are part of the fucking problem because a report is just a report and needs to be racked up to get a ban. Most assholes don't push it to that point. IF THEY DESERVE A BAN, GO TO IRC   And don't give me that ""IRC doesn't do shit"" spiel. If you feel pretty adamant about this person getting banned and they actually deserve it, it will resonate with the mods."

(Mod in question already commented) 3) This seemed above and beyond and I felt it deserved it's own post. The only ""after the fact"" about it is that I wanted to bring it up with the community too.  Like you said, you never know context. Some Ball didn't know the context but doubled down when I told him. I felt that needed a reminder post. I searched before I posted, since I didn't want to be too spammy. And hey look at that! The last post you could possibly categorize like this was a month ago and even that's a stretch. I'm sorry that I've set you off with another goddamn post this week, actually no, I'm not sorry.  People are being assholes and I wanted to make a PSA. It's not limited to this case, but this is by far the worst I've seen in recent months. I dealt with it in IRC, then searched the subreddit to see when the most recent post was, and combined that with the above-and-beyond nature of this instance and decided it was worth a post."

This definetly falls in the related category but it's something that has been iterated time and time again. People being assholes. It's nothing new.   Irc is where this belongs. I don't think your life story really needed to be posted. However, maybe a lifestory is possibly needed to get into these assholes thick-skulls to maybe stop.

TagPro,3dicov,robopuppycc,21,Thu Jul 16 14:44:02 2015 UTC,I believe that neutral flag by its nature supports a more individualistic style of play and is therefore less hampered by team imbalance. I'd much rather play down a man on a neutral flag map than a CTF map.
TagPro,3dicov,TicTag,8,Thu Jul 16 14:45:51 2015 UTC,"I will actually go ahead and disagree with you on this one. Although you are right on the offense part, I feel that neutral flag maps rely much more on coordination when it comes to defense. Many a map requires at least 2-3 balls to defend in a coordinated manner to keep enemy FCs at bay, whereas this is less prominent in CTF.   Maybe it's just me, but I feel that I can actually tip the odds of the game in our favour in a CTF game, whereas in Neutral Flag ones it seems much harder."

TagPro,3dicov,theycallmebbq,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:53:32 2015 UTC,"I think that 'coordinated contain' that happens on neutral flag maps is just a result of not having the secondary defensive option that CTF maps have (grabbing the enemy's flag and holding it to prevent a cap). The only thing that you can do on a neutral flag map is try to stay between the enemy FC and their goal.  I don't know if this supports either point, but I thought it was interesting."
TagPro,3dicov,jazzcigarettes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:55:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed Flail. I tend to see my highest win percentages on neutral flag maps, and I think it's because more often than not in those games I'm faced with moments where I am the one who wins or loses it. Like, I can focus on defense and stop the other team from capping basically by myself. And if you carry the flag deep enough into the enemy's zone enough times, eventually someone on your team will probably score."
TagPro,3dicov,theycallmebbq,2,Fri Jul 17 17:08:21 2015 UTC,"if you carry the flag deep enough into the enemy's zone enough times, eventually someone on your team will probably score.   This is kind of how I approach offense on neutral flag. Obviously you're always trying to cap but I think of it more as my goal is to keep a strong presence with the flag in their zone. It's like Corsi or other hockey stats. If I'm driving possession the teams odds of scoring go up substantially."
TagPro,3dicov,jt663,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:17:35 2015 UTC,"Right, I consider it a strong grab if I can advance the flag more than halfway into their zone or so. I want them to either have to reset it or make some moves to get out."
TagPro,3dicov,Kembangan,-1,Fri Jul 17 17:49:02 2015 UTC,"It's 1v4 tho, so if you're playing a good team it's harder to carry a team. You also need team work more on neutral"
TagPro,3dicov,tyrantula,8,Thu Jul 16 23:10:20 2015 UTC,"Depends on the map honestly. Old style nf maps greatly awarded individual skill and knowledge, ie cc richochet shine and volt, whereas id say cloud and bulldog heavily rewards team skill and knowledge. So newer nf maps are more punishing if you're a man down.   For ctf maps, I think the deciding factor is really how defensive the base is. The harder to grab, the worse it is to play a man down."
TagPro,3dicov,crblanz,2,Thu Jul 16 15:48:30 2015 UTC,"I was leaning towards NF maps, and I think this nails why.  More so with the current maps especially, if you're down, I feel like you're at a much bigger disadvantage due to the style of those maps.  Whereas in CTF, assuming at least slightly competent players, A single D player or two can hold D for at least a little bit and same on O, they aren't necessarily just going to get blocked out outright."
TagPro,3dicov,jazzcigarettes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:56:24 2015 UTC,"heavily disagree on bulldog, mostly because of those neutral boosts by the chokepoints.  greatest spot to just sit and wait.  agreed on cloud though, that map blows"

TagPro,3dicov,SamSims-,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:13:41 2015 UTC,"My win % on bulldog is probably around 90% so i'd argue that I'm probably not dumb. Directly up from your gate is a neutral boost, if you hang out by the boost and if know what you're doing, no one's getting past you ever . If you don't get what I'm talking about then you're probably the one that ""seems kinda dumb"" and is why you think bulldog isnt a map you can win with individual skill"
TagPro,3dicov,FaithNHumanityStatus,8,Fri Jul 17 05:35:02 2015 UTC,"Its CTF 100% if the other team is even semi competent, in neutral flag you can make individual plays to get caps if you're down a player.  However, on CTF if you're down a player you only have three positions filled: a flag carrier, one chaser and a regraber. It's pretty much impossible to return a smart flag carrier on your own so you have no chance of winning without the other team really messing up. You could try playing no regrab but that's incredibley risky.  Neutral is easier when a player down for sure."
TagPro,3dicov,donuts42,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:59:14 2015 UTC,I don't know. A decent part of the time solo d is viable as long as you play a good no grab. In NF the flag is pretty much constantly in a different position making it harder to defend.
TagPro,3dicov,FaithNHumanityStatus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:29:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but solo D can't get pups and any pups at all especially 2v1 can get out on any map."
TagPro,3dicov,donuts42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:45:35 2015 UTC,"If we're talking about somewhat competent players, you can say the same for NF."
TagPro,3dicov,FaithNHumanityStatus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:51:30 2015 UTC,"There's no such thing as ""solo d"" on NF. At most, you probably keep one person back, and he slows down the FC until teammates catch up. This is still just as reasonable a strat 3v4."
TagPro,3dicov,arjuna9,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:59:47 2015 UTC,"I'm referring to your remark about pups. 4v3 has the advantage there too in NF.  Also, NF has a larger goal to defend. CTF is literally one tile."
TagPro,3dicov,Buttersnack,6,Fri Jul 17 12:42:02 2015 UTC,"If it's pubs, NF is harder with 3 people. If it's organized, CTF is harder. I'd say this because your goal in 4v3 is really just to prevent the opposing team from scoring, and preventing a cap in neutral is hard when your 2 pub teammates are out of position. In CTF you're essentially playing NF with a 1-tile goal zone that you can also grab to take away, so it's not hard to play good O/D in pubs 3v4."
TagPro,3dicov,nolanizer,3,Thu Jul 16 16:48:28 2015 UTC,Scoring against three peopl in nf is way too easy. In ctf it's easy enough to just play defensively for a few minutes but nf games are often over before you get your fourth player.
TagPro,3dicov,xenonpulse,2,Thu Jul 16 16:58:38 2015 UTC,"CTF is harder to score a man down, because getting a return is near-impossible. It's easier to prevent the enemy from scoring, though, as you can simply play it safe and always keep someone on regrab.  NF is easier to score a man down, as a moment of individual brilliance could lead you into the end-zone. It is, however, harder to prevent the opponents from scoring, as you cannot simply wait on regrab, and rather have to coordinate with all your teammates to get the required chain of returns while being blocked by the opposition."
TagPro,3dicov,_q42_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:04:33 2015 UTC,"Neutral flag is less affected than CTF, because in CTF, it is inevitable that you will have either 1d, and let them out almost instantly, or 1o, and never get out."

TagPro,3dfwbq,jtiza,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:58:13 2015 UTC,"For someone who knows next to nothing about the NFL or Marshawn Lynch, can you explain to me why he was such a complete douche nozzle in this interview, ignoring/refusing to answer any questions?"
TagPro,3dfwbq,quassus,3,Thu Jul 16 01:58:32 2015 UTC,"He has social anxiety issues, and often feels he is portrayed in the media as a thug. Which basically translates to childish, passive aggressive interviews. This was from the week leading up to the Super Bowl so that also prob contributed.   edit: Tiza is prob more accurate.. Go hawks!"
TagPro,3dfwbq,Rhapsody_in_White,3,Thu Jul 16 02:00:34 2015 UTC,"Nope.  He hates the NFL media and is uncooperative, but the league fines players for refusing to speak to the media.  However, they literally don't fine based on responses - so him showing up and being a derp is his way of saying ""fuck you, NFL."""
TagPro,3dfwbq,arjuna9,3,Thu Jul 16 03:20:55 2015 UTC,"Has anybody ever explained to him that it's because of the exposure the media brings that NFL viewership/fandom is possible and thus his exorbitantly high wages are possible? In short, that without the media, his job is a whole hell of a lot less comfortable+glamorous?"
TagPro,3dfwbq,quassus,3,Thu Jul 16 03:29:15 2015 UTC,"Soapbox somewhere else, homes.  You're not wrong at face value, but that doesn't necessary justify the entire circus or every requirement."
TagPro,3dfwbq,quassus,4,Thu Jul 16 03:32:57 2015 UTC,"For whatever reason it just kinda upsets me when I see athletes act so entitled and downright disrespectful to other human beings who are just doing their job. Like... Wimbledon just wrapped up. Compare the way Lynch behaves toward the media to the way a guy like Federer (or most anybody at the top of the sport) comports himself and orients himself toward the whole tennis fandom and media machine. Obviously interviews and such are not the most fun thing to do all of the time, but he faces them with grace and good humor because he understands the simple fact that being a pro athlete is the best job in the world and the media is just part of that job.   tldr: @Lynch: have some respect for your fans who make what you do possible you blockhead  Disclaimer: I know nothing about NFL so everything I'm saying is based on my impression from that one linked interview, could be wildly wrong about his overall character, idk. But this attitude is pervasive at the top level of a lot of sports in general so my point stands.  OKAY SOAPBOX OVER I REALIZE IT'S THE WRONG PLACE FOR IT ANYWAY lol"
TagPro,3dfwbq,RonSpawnsonTP,12,Thu Jul 16 03:42:14 2015 UTC,"He had a lot of off the field issues where he felt the media was unfair to him. He thought they attacked him personally and crossed lines. It's not just that he doesn't like doing interviews. As for the fans, nobody cares about the answers to these idiotic questions anyways. Lynch's ridiculous interviews get way more attention and are way more entertaining. And Seattle fans love him."
TagPro,3dfwbq,Dinosawyerr,4,Thu Jul 16 04:07:07 2015 UTC,"Finally finished it all, nice job! You did well with the moderation, keeping things moving a reasonable pace but allowing enough to be said on each topic. I think the music was fine when it wasn't too loud. I'd say keep it for next time as long as it's very soft in the background. Looking forward to another at the end of the regular season!"

TagPro,3djwj3,uhhhhmmmm,-7,Thu Jul 16 21:34:37 2015 UTC,NLTP is bigger and contains more of the playerbase. Why exclude the majority?   Edit: Is this not true?
TagPro,3djwj3,neyvit1,12,Thu Jul 16 21:37:39 2015 UTC,Same reason why ESPN has MLB on the front page and not the minor league teams despite there being a lot more.
TagPro,3djwj3,Ballymandias,2,Thu Jul 16 21:39:16 2015 UTC,This isn't MLB where millions of people who dont play follow. This is tagpro in which most of the players play in Novice.

Main league, etc etc. As for why both aren't on there, I believe when this has been brought up before it's been 1) a space issue and 2) if you're adding NLTP, why not mLTP, eLTP, etc? So they've just simplified it to the top league from each area.   again i apologize i needed something to snap at"

Certainly deserves the spot there as well as OLTP and ELTP. Makes perfect sense. Yet, the biggest league in ALL OF TAGPRO is NLTP. That's just straight fact.   I'm not playing dumb. I understand. I'm asking why not? You gave a good point, I feel as though I gave one that showed numbers. Numbers never lie. I'm not trying to burn down tagpro here.

TagPro,3djwj3,dccarlove,2,Thu Jul 16 22:11:44 2015 UTC,I'm in NLTP and what he is saying is the main league gets the attention because they are the best players. You don't hear about silver cs:go games because its a lower level of play and gets less attention. It is a lesser league with lesser players and doesn't get as much attention because of that. It doesn't matter if it's the majority or not lol. He's not riding a high horse he is correct.
TagPro,3djwj3,Ballymandias,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:59:15 2015 UTC,Most of the people don't give a crap about majors until it comes superball. Why? Because everyone's busy in their own leagues.

TagPro,3djwj3,Ballymandias,8,Thu Jul 16 22:38:11 2015 UTC,"The side bar is the top leagues of each of tagpros main demographics. Yes NLTP is bigger, but here is the harsh truth people don't want to realize. No one really cares. Im sorry and Im not trying to be a dick here but its true. Most people who don't play competitive but follow it only care about MLTP ELTP or OLTP. Just look at viewership numbers of the Super ball to the Muper Ball to the Nuper Ball. As well as new people who come to this sub for the first time will probably be more interested in seeing how the best players play rather than the ""lowest"" level of play. I put lowest in quotes because there is real talent in NLTP and no one can deny that, but most people learn about this games competitive scene through the top leagues first. So it just makes more sense to have MLTP there and not NLTP.  Plus I think I remember someone saying they are pretty much out of space in the side bar anyway."
TagPro,3djwj3,dccarlove,5,Thu Jul 16 21:51:52 2015 UTC,"I'd actually like to point out that the whole ""running-out-of-space"" crisis was resolved a long time ago. Believe me, there is plenty of space in the sidebar to fill if need be."

If you aren't countering that statement that's one thing, but if you are, I mean... I don't know what to tell ya.  You asked why NLTP Standings weren't in the sidebar, and you were given an answer, which you disagreed with.  Your question was a completely reasonable one... one that's been asked many times before.

Most people don't give a shit about NLTP until they're in it. Same with mLTP then eventually MLTP, etc etc. If its about caring. As I've said earlier, most of the tagpro community plays in NLTP.

TagPro,3dfwp6,passTheFlag,8,Wed Jul 15 23:20:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's (somewhat) common knowledge that there is a bug related to the .25 second delay after grabbing. Normally when you grab you can touch a defender at any point during the first .25 seconds after grabbing. But when you have an rb, if an opponent touches you during the first .25 seconds after grabbing, you pop. It's basically just Opposite Day when you have a rolling bomb."

TagPro,3df55h,-WPD-,70,Thu Jul 16 23:59:38 2015 UTC,"Unpopular opinion time: I don't think this is a good idea. The TagPro script universe is incredibly vast. I alone use about 35 scripts, mostly for stats and design (with ball spin and other basic things sprinkled in there), and none of the scripts I've ever owned have given me a competitive advantage, except maybe manual chat macros, which have been approved for a long time. But apparently I'm not allowed to play with the TagPro Site Themer activated because it makes my background too red, therefore I am cheating until it's submitted to this github page. Oh, and I fixed margins to better fit my screen in one of nabby's scripts? Submit it or b&.  And with every version of every legal script ever made, we are literally looking at potentially thousands, not hundreds, of scripts on this page. How do I find a new script I want to use in a forest of other scripts to know if it's legal? Furthermore, I do a fair bit of script testing out for nabby to help him identify potential issues before their release, but this means I can only test his scripts on servers with no people on them, which frankly isn't useful sometimes. Having everyone submit their scripts is going to be really tedious on our end just to do it, and even more so on your end trying to go through them all to make sure there's nothing unacceptable snuck in there.  I'm really not alright with this idea. It was much better before when there were specific rules to follow that disallowed certain scripts. I don't know what kind of script detection you have in place, but if I get banned because my table margins are too wide on YAIS, I'm leaving TagPro until Next comes out.  This is a very good way to decrease interest in our leagues. Just my two cents."
TagPro,3df55h,Moosemaster21,23,Wed Jul 15 22:32:59 2015 UTC,"Also note that the testing servers even differ from production servers in code. A userscript that works on testing servers might not work correctly on production servers, or vice versa."

TagPro,3df55h,-salt-,22,Fri Jul 17 20:26:12 2015 UTC,"This is an extremely shortsighted and careless move by the league commissioners. This is a case where there is already a perfectly good system in place and then they decide to replace it with an unbelievably time-consuming process with no discernible benefit. Can someone please tell me how placing a blanket ban on all userscripts (not on the whitelist) is a good idea instead of just blacklisting the ones that are obviously against the rules?   This not only places a heavy burden on script makers to have to constantly resubmit their scripts after making only minor changes, but also the league ""representatives"" that have to painstakingly go through each individual submission to determine it's eligibility for the whitelist. Not only that, but they expect devs to waste time and resources to look for these ""illegal"" scripts on EVERY player that's currently in a league even after they've said that they were done helping commissioners with detection in the past.   With this rule, anyone who likes to tinker with scripts or make adjustments to any they currently use will have to wait several days just to get ""approval"" to use it in a pub. That is ridiculously inconvenient and completely unnecessary. If I don't like how the scoreboard looks, then I'm going to change it. I'm not going to wait for someone to tell me it's okay to adjust the margins.   TagPro prides itself on it's modding community and the only thing this rule does is hamper creativity and suck the enjoyment out of the game. When you play in a pub, you are there to have fun and you shouldn't have to worry about getting banned from a league because you decided to put googly eyes on your ball.   The only thing this rule did was erase any interest I've had in ever joining a league and I'm sure that can be said for many other players out there as well. If the objective here was to discourage players from joining the competitive scene, then mission accomplished."
TagPro,3df55h,EatMyPancakes,8,Thu Jul 16 12:23:04 2015 UTC,"The idea of a whitelist is not necessarily wrong, especially not if it is harmonized across leagues, however it should be a list of generic textual descriptions of types of functionality that are permitted, supplemented with examples, rather than a full source code repository that must contain an identical version of every script in use.  Example entry of a good whitelist:   Collecting data or statistics for post-game analysis or visualisation (e.g. TagPro Replays, Catstats, TagPro Analytics)"
TagPro,3df55h,Ronding,4,Thu Jul 16 17:45:22 2015 UTC,"I agree that this would be a much better approach, however a lot of scripts out there still have a huge variability and it might be hard to account for all of them.

TagPro,3df55h,EatMyPancakes,17,Thu Jul 16 23:03:00 2015 UTC,That's one problem with keeping detection methods secret.

That's going to be a huge pain in the ass.  ...Unless: Unless it's the case that the devs have a catch-all detection system for userscripts/extensions whereby they'll be able to nail cheaters who were previously evasive.

I think this is a really bad way to prevent cheating. The leagues shouldn't have this much power over public games. And a whitelist instead of a ban on specific types of scripts is ridiculous.

TagPro,3df55h,oSo_Squiggly,19,Thu Jul 16 11:03:03 2015 UTC,"Q: Are scripts that only run in spectate mode subject to the whitelist?  A: No! You may run any script in spectate mode that doesn't interfere with the game at hand. (No sending messages automatically, for example)   This just gave me a really good idea!  So you allow spec only scripts because you know that they cannot be used in league play for any advantage.   How about we also allow all ""non-grouped"" scripts? For example, someone could engineer a specific version of the powerup timer script that only works if a game is not a grouped game! That means they are no longer at a disadvantage for rolling 300.   This could be an excellent way to closely regulate league script use, whilst retaining freedom in pubs (non grouped pubs, that is).  What do you think /u/privatemajor? I'd be happy to do some investigation to see if there are any flags we can use to develop a common pattern for ""grouped game"" detection."

The general idea is, you allow any spectating only scripts because they confer no in league game advantage. A spectating only script starts with a check to make sure the user is in spectate mode (by checking in game attributes). If not in spectate mode, the script immediately stops execution.  What I'm proposing is now you also allow non-grouped only scripts because they confer no in league game advantage. A non-grouped only script would start with a check to make sure the user is in a non grouped game (by checking for certain attributes). If in a grouped game, the script immediately stops execution.  tl;dr: This proposition allows you to regulate league script usage without impacting scripts used in pubs for achieving rolling 300. League players would no longer be at a disadvantage in pubs"

TagPro,3df55h,snaps_,10,Wed Jul 15 22:32:14 2015 UTC,"Super easy. Just check for tagpro.group.socket.

I'm surprised they even allow you to use them as a spectator."
TagPro,3df55h,RonSpawnsonTP,3,Wed Jul 15 23:23:28 2015 UTC,Perhaps they have new detection mechanisms to verify you are using a whitelisted script?  Clearly they claim to be able to check for spec only so they should be able to enhance that for non group only as well.
TagPro,3df55h,DatBlizzard,4,Wed Jul 15 23:25:09 2015 UTC,I mean it's extremely easy for them to check for these things but I cannot possibly see how they could check for being a spectator (and potentially being in a group) and yet not at the same time have a timestamp of when that was.

TagPro,3df55h,i_practice_santeria,3,Wed Jul 15 23:30:21 2015 UTC,"My guess is they didn't get timestamps, because they assumed the times people cheated wouldn't be important. However, they didn't anticipate the nuances in the argument with some classes of scripts being illegal in competitive but legal, or gray area, in pubs. If the devs were to green light another sting, you can bet they would include timestamps, spec status, group status (public or private), and other players in the game so they could definitively say whether the cheating occurred in pubs or competitive."

I'm somewhat guessing at this point, but I think the devs would just see that this player didn't use a userscript that checked for tagpro.group.socket. They wouldn't know if he was using a script that would normally check for that. Even if you require that every script checks for tagpro.group.socket, I think the cheater could make a dummy script just to check that.  But I may be completely wrong. It would be nice to get someone more knowledgeable about userscripts here."
TagPro,3df55h,RonSpawnsonTP,8,Wed Jul 15 23:39:12 2015 UTC,"I mean, you can say this about any script.

At some point you have to trust the detection methods.

Like, if I wanted to play S9 MLTP, do I need to only be using white listed scripts by the time of the draft or by Week 1? For USC, if the day I join a team, I turn off all potential non-approved scripts I should be good to play in actual games, right?

TagPro,3df55h,WillWorkForSugar,2,Thu Jul 16 03:40:44 2015 UTC,"We're getting into murky territory here, because the devs can't give away how the detection works. There are two major options here:   Cheating can be detected at any time. This means they either check automatically or periodically/randomly. They can detect it as players are in games. This is more likely, as they have (almost) full insight when players are logged on."
TagPro,3df55h,TagProNitro,4,Thu Jul 16 05:02:07 2015 UTC,"I don't really think the devs are going to go through the trouble of running checks on every competitive player during every MLTP, NLTP, USC, ELTP, OLTP, and CC game -- or even at random (kinda like how certain jobs or sports leagues issue random drug tests). I think that more or less the detection tool(s) just scans/filters through every active player that plays TagPro whether it be pubs or private matches while gathering what information the game is giving to players via user scripts or what information user scripts are requesting from the game and then cross references that info with the registered names people have in competitive play. This is why I believe players aren't allowed to use black listed user scripts in pubs while simultaneously being active in one of these leagues even if they turned off every single user script they have for competitive games.   I just want to kinda get an idea of the window in which a player needs to be black list user script free in relation to when an xLTP season starts or when joining onto a USC team."

Think about it: What if a new upgrade comes out? They upgrade the ""required version""  of the userscript and now every player needs to upgrade or be banned? It's not feasible to say we can enforce what version of a script someone uses, nor should the commissioners have such authority.

All updates so far were bug fixes and minor feature enhancements that don't affect gameplay. Furthermore, what about scripts that load external resources, or auto-updating scripts? I'd be useful to have some generic allowances for such cases. Applying these rules to public games will be very inconvenient to script developers who also want to participate in leagues. From my experience, it is really necessary to test in real games sometimes rather than on empty testing servers, if only to see how useful it is during a real match. Is this to prevent people from inflating their stats to increase their chances to get drafted? I'd suggest to just follow the Koalabeast rules on botting here, perhaps supplemented with a requirement of disclosure of scripts uses during the last 300 matches on league sign-up or something."
TagPro,3df55h,arjuna9,11,Wed Jul 15 20:54:51 2015 UTC,"So do scripts we are using need to be textually identical to a script on the GitHub whitelist? For example, I modified the team scoreboard script myself to include pups and I'm sure other nearly identical but independently created versions of that are floating around. Do these all need to be submitted individually? Or will there now be one ""canonical"" script for every functionality and small modifications are not allowed?  I understand it would be a PITA for commissioners to parse each slightly modified script to determine it isn't cheating, but that would still be a shame if we can't make small tweaks to common scripts. Also, it will make it annoying (and error-prone) for players to ensure they are only using whitelisted scripts. The best method would be to delete all scripts in TamperMonkey and then replace them with ones found on the whitelist."
TagPro,3df55h,Moosemaster21,-1,Wed Jul 15 20:49:07 2015 UTC,"We plan to have versioned scripts on the whitelist for this reason. There will be one ""canonical"" script for every functionality.

TagPro,3df55h,RonSpawnsonTP,9,Wed Jul 15 22:17:37 2015 UTC,"How would you handle a case like this:  I made the Patterned Floor Tiles script. Arbybear has a small request and I end up adding a small feature and provide an updated script just for him here. I didn't even bother to update the version to reflect that it was different than the two that currently exist in the repository under ""TagPro Tile Pattern 0.1.0"" and ""Tile Pattern"".  I assume that I don't have to worry about getting anything approved in this case, since it doesn't really concern me if a small offshoot of a script gets used by competitive players. So let's say that Arbybear does play competitive and sends it in for approval, how would that conflict be handled with the versions of the script already in existence in the repository?"
TagPro,3df55h,snaps_,7,Wed Jul 15 22:14:43 2015 UTC,Good question! Do we have to keep different forks of every script as well? This could get messy. It's the same discussion around customized macro scripts I think.  Perhaps each player appends their name to their fork of a script?
TagPro,3df55h,RonSpawnsonTP,5,Wed Jul 15 22:34:21 2015 UTC,"That could work. I think at the very least a more consistent naming scheme is called for, it's overkill but [userscript name]-[version]-[author]-[submitter]-[date].user.js would cover most cases. The fact that the Tile Pattern script is in there twice doesn't bode well, but this is just day 1 of the new process being put in place."
TagPro,3df55h,arjuna9,2,Wed Jul 15 22:41:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't even consider that different players use different versions. They need to maintain multiple different versions, because you can't force players to have to play on the most recent version in case it had conflicts with other versions or bugs introduced, etc."
TagPro,3df55h,xenonpulse,6,Wed Jul 15 22:45:15 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks for the clarification. If I'm reading this right, then any small tweak to a script should be submitted to the whitelist."

TagPro,3df55h,PrivateMajor,3,Wed Jul 15 22:03:35 2015 UTC,I know you arent botting or we would be winning our NLTP games.
TagPro,3df55h,RonSpawnsonTP,5,Wed Jul 15 22:49:03 2015 UTC,"Do you plan on closing other major loopholes in your rules?   Right now it is super easy for someone to spectate and then communicate with one or more other players giving them pup timers, enemy FC location, chaser location, etc. Yes, you can lock down mumble but you can't stop people from communicating via Skype,  IRC, or cell phone and that is untrackable.   The two solutions I would offer would be to either forbid non streamers from spectating, or to request TagPro be changed to have a configurable delay for spectators. NewCompte said this would be super easy, but he would want to know if leagues would actually use it before he invested time into implementing it."
TagPro,3df55h,DaEvil1,3,Wed Jul 15 21:46:43 2015 UTC,The captains specifically debated this issue in the pre-season and overwhelmingly felt like they could trust their competitors to not cheat while spectating on things like Skype/IRC/etc.  The benefits to letting teams watch via spectator outweigh the thread of cheating here.  I think the change NewCompte suggested would be fantastic.
TagPro,3df55h,Buttersnack,7,Wed Jul 15 21:52:28 2015 UTC,"Still seems like a drastic loophole. Why do you not trust people with scripts, yet trust people with spec spots?   I'm sure there will be players that exploit these loopholes if they exist. We already found players botting in leagues. Why wouldn't players cheat via spec communication?   Also, sounds like you like NewCompte's idea. I'll try to communicate this back to him!"
TagPro,3df55h,halfmoon_kid,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:02:59 2015 UTC,"I think the difference is that the only person who knows if you cheat using bots/scripts/etc. is you.  I don't really trust individuals, but I do trust every team overall in general.  I don't believe an entire team would be complicit in cheating, which is what would have to happen if you cheated using Skype or something.  It was frustrating to have players have to not only be benched in MLTP, to also not get to spectate the match when they were the sub."
TagPro,3df55h,FaithNHumanityStatus,5,Wed Jul 15 22:07:02 2015 UTC,"I agree that having a whole team cheat is extremelly unlikely.  However, you could have two players cheat, unknown to the rest of the team. They still have the advantage of knowing pup times and you only need to close buddies to be in cahoots for it. Not outside the realm of possibilities."
TagPro,3df55h,xenonpulse,9,Wed Jul 15 22:09:55 2015 UTC,Why doesn't the enjoyment of people who play PUBs with disallowed competetive scripts outweigh the treat of cheating? I'd really like to know what the difference is here.
TagPro,3df55h,RonSpawnsonTP,4,Thu Jul 16 08:20:45 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, this does not impact scripts that only change the profile page, home page, etc. and scripts that are only used on the group page, right? For example, the ""Date Joined"" script and a script that sends macros from the group page (currently I only have this enabled on Newcompte2 anyway) shouldn't have anything to do with this, right?"
TagPro,3df55h,PorridgeTP,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:02:46 2015 UTC,"mfw I thought I could finally use googly eyes.   well anyway, here's my argument for googly eyes, considering this is really the only script I care about lol  -googly eyes, are the most amazing thing ever. if anything, it's distracting to the player, it's pretty much purely for decoration  -the fact that I can't ever play with this script again because I play in a league, is the dumbest shit ever. If I wanna pub I wanna have fun and enjoy lookin at those eyes go wacko all over my ball, pubs ain't fun without RJ or googly eyes  -tagpro spins is allowed, yet, that's soooo cheating. If your eyes ain't trained for that spin, that spin script gives you a huge advantage, as for googly eyes, you can't really use that as an advantage. How not? well I mean I guess the more you play with you could train your eye for that, but like mentioned before the googly eyes are more distracting than anything. I've tested it out in pubs to see if ""its tracking my velocity."" Ron claims you can see the velocity in its eyes when you go slow enough. K. For one, no one will ever go slow in league, fuck, no one even goes slow enough to detect it in pubs. I had to be moving like 2 pixels a second to detect my fucking velocity with that script (when I tested it to look for velocity). Aint no one gonna be moving that slow unless they called a timeout. Otherwise, when going at a normal speed, the eyes are undetectable for their velocity, and literally will help you in no way.   -Even if not allowed in MLTP, it should be allowed in NLTP. NLTP still have new players, who have barely even experienced the game, and you're going to make them abide by these rules in order to play in a league? They still wanna have fun in pubs, and in competitive. They are simply getting the feel for this. If I had to pretty much play with ugly vanilla the rest of tagpro, I'd be done. And for those who have played the game a while (me, BC, baggins etc) they don't need a googly eyes script to detect velocity, our eyes are trained to see the speed they're going at. I've always known NLTP to be the league that's ""not so serious, and more of a fun competitive scence,"" making it so scripts aren't allowed, is kind of ruining that vibe/reputation."

TagPro,3dg11f,ko890317,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:56:51 2015 UTC,"Ditto, great job E! What makes you think that constriction will have a lot of anti-re?"
TagPro,3dg11f,Nqoba4,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:26:22 2015 UTC,"Just based on how the middle is constricted in this map. I feel even with anti-re, it's easier in this map to camp in the middle (or sit by the boost), slow down the enemy fc, and get the return than the other big maps. Not the same map, but similar in a sense that Pilot also has a choke point in the middle. I could be wrong but I thought many MLTP teams used anti-re strategy on Pilot more than the other maps. Of course all bets are off when powerups/our team has the flag/depending on the situation. Also, I've seen teams using anti-re if they are ahead by 3-4 caps to prevent the regrab chain."
TagPro,3dg11f,ko890317,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:02:17 2015 UTC,"I guess we'll see. My opinion is that anti-re is completely underused, but I still don't think constriction is a good place to do it. Maps that are perfect for anti-re are ones in which it is extremely hard to contain players or where regrab lasts forever. Your flag carrier should have the freedom to move around to find the opponent's flag carrier and try to kiss. I think this is true for Pilot, but not so true for constriction."
TagPro,3dg11f,Nqoba4,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:19:56 2015 UTC,"My opinion is that anti-re is completely underused   Agreed.   Maps that are perfect for anti-re are ones in which it is extremely hard to contain players or where regrab lasts forever.    Agreed. But maybe I'm old schooled but I often conservatively get off the re when anti-re is setup in my base to chase the enemy fc to get the quick return for the cap and with Constriction's map design, I feel more comfortable than other big maps to play that way. Of course this doesn't work in pubs, but I can see possibly happening in competitive games with good communication."

TagPro,3dh3kz,arjuna9,5,Thu Jul 16 05:44:48 2015 UTC,"Final revision:  http://maps.jukejuice.com/save/11913 http://unfortunate-maps.jukejuice.com/static/previews/11136.png  In the final version I decided two teamboosts in base was too strong for the defense, and also removed two spikes from the middle because holding the flag in the mid looked too difficult.    OP: Here is a slight modification:  http://unfortunate-maps.jukejuice.com/show/10944 http://unfortunate-maps.jukejuice.com/static/previews/10944.png  Primarily this changes the bomb chute, allowing you to choose an angle that shoots you up to the top of the base instead of the bottom. I like that it gives FCs a lot of choice in how to enter base, a general principle that a lot of the more constricted newer maps miss IMO. Do you think this is a good change or is the simplicity of the original idea better?  I'd like to hear any other thoughts from the MTC and community on what they like or dislike about the map."
TagPro,3dh3kz,Blazeth,3,Thu Jul 16 06:07:40 2015 UTC,I really miss the DZ3 superboosts.
TagPro,3dh3kz,arjuna9,3,Thu Jul 16 18:52:39 2015 UTC,me too but I don't think they could work on a map of this size. And the other elements I want to keep would be too strong on a larger map like the original.
TagPro,3dh3kz,DaEvil1,5,Thu Jul 16 19:20:48 2015 UTC,"My 3 main issues with it:   I miss the split up gate from DZ3. Maybe it's just nostalgia speaking, but it made me feel powerful, and it felt like part of the identity of the map. Hitting the new bomb combo feels like it lacks the spontaneity that DZ3 had about it. The map would naturally drive you towards the boost where you could do it, and you could make a split second decision on wether to go back, take it, walk it in, or hide by the bomb with the pup for a while. Of course all that freedom for the fc led to it being really chasey, but it feels like you've scaled back on it too much, where it now recquires 3-4 seconds planning and moving into position before executing the move. Since it's shrunk significantly in size, it might be worth it to reevaluate just how many boosts you have pointed at the middle. Testing it with 4-5 players, it already felt like you were getting bumped around a lot, so it might be too annoying to be enjoyable in a proper 4v4   Other than that I think it's fine, and I really like that small change with the middle spikes making it flow so much more naturally than before."
TagPro,3dh3kz,arjuna9,4,Thu Jul 16 08:36:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback,   I thought the split gate would simply be pointless given that people won't be flying in from that direction anymore, but I tried it out and it does look like it could be interesting if the neutral boost had a direct shot on flag through the gate. Here's that revision. I'm not sure how to fix this entirely, because as you say increasing the options for the FC there would make the map more chasey. However, I think many people commenting on how long it takes to set up haven't found an easily-abused boost route: http://streamable.com/xlmc . Effectively, I don't see the bombs as an individual element, but more as a way to preserve more options for the 3-boost gate in mid now that there's no tunnel. Yeah, I could see that being an issue. Do you think simply reducing the number of boosts at the gate would help, and making one team-colored? like this. Another option might be to remove the lower boost pair in favor of a bomb configuration that doesn't allow many angles out of base."
TagPro,3dh3kz,DaEvil1,2,Thu Jul 16 16:09:36 2015 UTC,"Personally I like the new one better. The top gate (right base) might feel a bit too far away from the button though. Not sure since I've only tried it alone, but the general feeling I get is that the side gate feels cosy and close to you, while the top gate just feels a bit distant. I'm honestly unsure if this is just a feeling or if it translates into how I imagine gameplay will go on it. But I'd say for now that it seems better now, but I'd try to play it out with a couple of people to make sure it feels rewarding and purposeful before sunday.  Getting that equilibrium between fun and balanced is still is largely a mystery to me as a mapmaker, so I can definitely emphasize. That is a neat boost route though that I think helps the case for it, though when running around I found it pretty easy to mess up and get unsatisfying wall-bounces which might get frustrating especially in clutch situations. I think on a general level my worry about the bombs as they are, is that they might be a bit too straightforward now. It obviously depends on what people discover about them, but since they aren't too accessible and may not be part of the natural flow of the movement, along with the tunnel being quite narrow (though that boost you posted might end up being part of the natural flow so I might be wrong there), they'll end up being a very binary proposition where either it works and you escape/get a good chance to cap, or it doesn't and you die.   I think the little nook you added helps a bit in that respect compared to the version we tested. On DZ3 the way it was set up, the boost gave you a lot of power and flexibility compared to DZ4 to determine your own faith when deciding if you wanted to do something risky. While here, once you go to the tunnel, you most likely commit to going for the bombs since there's nothing else to do in the tunnel itself. This might just be part of the difference between button bombs and boosts in itself, but I think it's an important difference that takes away some complexity and dimensions from the gameplay.  I also kind of feel like if you want the bombs to be a part of an altogether element connected with the boostgates there would be a more natural solution possible that flowed better with the map, added some flexibility and didn't require boosting off the wall to reach in reasonable time.  In terms of boosts, I was personally a big fan of the boosts they were on DZ3 originally, so anything to preserve that spirit in a successor would be something I'd prefer. And I think the boost solution you presented could very well do that (without being certain).  Apparently I have a lot of thoughts about DZ3/4. Not sure if it's helpful or not, but hopefully it is."
TagPro,3dh3kz,arjuna9,2,Thu Jul 16 17:36:23 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your thoughts on the maps, it is interesting to see what elements from DZ3 are most important to people. As usual revising an existing map is tricky because we have trouble letting go of enjoyable parts of the old map that unfortunately can't work in an improved version for modern play. But you're right that the goal should still be to preserve the spirit of the old map that people liked.  I have this version now that moves the bomb closer to the front of the ""tunnel"" (not sure if it can be called that anymore). http://unfortunate-maps.jukejuice.com/show/10977 It allows for more angles when hitting the button, including directly into base. Since it's so much closer, it can be a quick decision without such a commitment. Performing the ""combo"" with the boost is harder to aim now, but it's still possible with practice and I think maps should have elements that require practice.  oh and one other thing I changed about this version was reducing the height of the base by 1 by moving the 2-gate closer to the flag. Now it's identical to the original gate layout, although the button is in a different spot. What I like about this gate layout is that you can run plays to boost defenders off the button and then boost through gate, but it's a risk because missing hitting someone involves spiking yourself."
TagPro,3dh3kz,DaEvil1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:10:20 2015 UTC,"I like it better. A few things that still bother me though:   The 45s vertically opposite to the base bomb feels a bit punishing. assuming you want to get out, and hit the bomb at speed, it feels pretty hard to hit it without hitting the blocks with the gates, or the 45s sending you directly back into base. To me it feels like if you manage to hit it at speed (or trick defence into defusing it at a bad time) so you don't hit the gateblocks, it shouldn't send you back to your base so much of the time. I'm also skeptical to the 45 near the double bomb, it just feels annoying to hit that corner when manouvring around it, but that might be my personal preference. Not sure if it will be better without it there.   Aside from that I feel it's pretty good."
TagPro,3dh3kz,arjuna9,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:23:40 2015 UTC,"For the base bomb, I did purposefully want it to be difficult to bomb out of base. I think with practice it can be hit directly up + a little out of base consistently. But on balance I felt it would be better not to have that as a strong escape tool for someone who's just gotten regrab. And that the offensive/defensive balance of the bases was acceptable.  That block is important for a bunch of nice boosts from the original map unfortunately.  http://puu.sh/j4gw0/fb19c23cd0.jpg  Of course it wasn't a 45 before which kind of made it seem more ""expected"" when you ran into it. But as a 45 it allows a little more leniency when hitting the boost down to the double bomb."
TagPro,3dh3kz,TPsquirrely,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:54:17 2015 UTC,"A large part of DZ3 were the 2 spike tunnels and this is completely missing it. I feel also that the double bomb is out of the way and pointless most of the time, maybe if there was a powerup next to it."
TagPro,3dh3kz,arjuna9,2,Thu Jul 16 11:32:10 2015 UTC,"I don't believe it's possible for a good map to resemble DZ3 and also have 4/5 lanes through the middle. It's too difficult to stop regrab when there are 4 options for the re to boost out of base.  I think the bomb can be useful, but it is intentionally situational. I'll consider removing the mid pup in favor of pups in the bomb corners though. Still, I feel like 3 pups total is the best number for a map to have right now and that having a base pup is important."
TagPro,3dh3kz,i_practice_santeria,2,Thu Jul 16 16:40:20 2015 UTC,"Does a good job of retaining the essence of DZ3 while addressing some of its biggest issues: 1) the large, circular mid with 4 lanes and 2) five powerups. I'm still concerned that the 3 boosts by gate make regrab OP. Here's a thought that might combat that issue: what if the buttons for mid gate were also wired up to their respective bases' gates? I think it would give coordinated defenses a better chance at getting resets."
TagPro,3dh3kz,arjuna9,3,Thu Jul 16 06:09:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks yank, yeah that's definitely an issue I was worried about. That idea is interesting and I hadn't considered it. The problem I see with it though is that I'm afraid it would cause a lot ""cheap deaths"" on the gate that players can't see coming. And keeping track of the state of both buttons every time you contemplate using the gate wouldn't be fun imo.  Here's how I think defenses could currently sweep back into base to contain a re who's not trying to get past mid:  http://puu.sh/j1sQT/892a448efb.png  I think the 1 defender can contain common boosts through the center mid while also defending any moves through the top gate, and then hold position around that spot. The 2 defender should sweep up through the bottom mid and then into the base, closing off low angles that 1 defender can't contain from his position. Once he's forced the FC away from the boosts or forced the FC to boost into a dead-end top route, the 1 defender could come in to help with the kill.  Of course it won't usually be that clean in-game, but the essential part I think is that one defender can contain both top routes, allowing the other defender to flush out the FC and sometimes put them in a compromising position for the return."

TagPro,3dh3kz,arjuna9,3,Thu Jul 16 05:47:13 2015 UTC,"Here's a pretty quick way to use them: http://streamable.com/xlmc  Also, with two options for the blast direction in the current version, I think as long as you have some separation from the chasers you have an opportunity of choosing an angle that gets you past. I might still try to make that area more flexible, but I do kind of intend for it to have limited use."
TagPro,3dh3kz,Clydas,2,Thu Jul 16 05:49:09 2015 UTC,"OK. I wonder if it might be better if for the three wall tiles directly adjacent, you'd be better off making (for the bottom button) the left one and top one a 45, erase the corner 90, and then make the 90 1 up and 2 left into another 90 to make a small tunnel that will be kinda tough to use, especially with the bombs there. But maybe that will then just be OP...."

This would influence what color the shirt should be. So I'd avoid green or red (to xmas-y) pink could work, but I as a girl really am not fond of the color. grey or black would look nice. yellow could look neat and so could blue you'd just have to make sure the green has enough contrast.   You could always do them black but I do like the idea of the two tone. I honestly like the second design. If it won I would buy it.   either way good work.

Since you do need to play the full 300 games to appear, my point is invalid. /u/marmaris74 and /u/ravenpride are correct.  Hypothetically, you could keep creating accounts and playing a decent number of games until you get an account where you were doing really well (by luck) during the first few dozen games on that account and have a high win percentage. This would make it much easier to have a high rolling win percentage on one of your accounts.  Basically, if you play on multiple accounts, by simple statistics you'll perform better on some of them than others. If you're already rather good, one of the accounts you use may have an ungodly win percentage."

TagPro,3dbanj,-Albus-,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:38:46 2015 UTC,"If you create multiple accounts, it defeats the point of the rolling 300.  The idea of the rolling 300 is that is shows how well you have been playing recently, but includes enough games that any lucky streaks you may be having will be balanced out. Normally, if you have a lucky streak and do really good for a number of games, it will be balanced out by your normal performance in the previous games that make up your rolling 300. However, if you keep starting fresh with new accounts, eventually you will get a lucky streak at the beginning of the use of a new account, and so your win percentage will be higher (not by that much necessarily, but by a noticeable amount) on that account.  I'm not saying anybody can just make new accounts until they get a 84% rolling - whoever did this probably has a 70%+ rolling on their main account. But the use of multiple accounts means that some accounts will do better than others (simply by statistics)."
TagPro,3dbanj,ravenpride,5,Wed Jul 15 01:19:37 2015 UTC,"No, WowSuch is right. Making new accounts doesn't help you get a better Rolling 300 percentage.  Refer to this marginally helpful diagram as you read the following paragraph:  Suppose there's a guy named Player 1 who plays on the same account until he gets a 10-game win streak at some point. Suppose there's also a dude named Player 2 who creates new accounts until he starts out one of his Rolling 300s with a 10-game win streak. At that point, both players are in the exact same situation: they're 290 games away from completing a Rolling 300 that began with a 10 wins. Thus, Player 2 has no advantage over Player 1."
TagPro,3dbanj,FaithNHumanityStatus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:25:55 2015 UTC,The only way is by the smurf effect. Getting a slight advantage in some games due to your degree. But that's very negligible so it still doesn't quite pan out.

I welcome all sorts of entries, I would love to try new stuff. In fact, last thread I submitted something with guitar on it to try something new.

Your best resources are just going to be things you can find through google.  If you have a Mac, you have GarageBand which is a lot like a watered down version of logic and that could be a good place to start before deciding to get an expensive program. There are likely other free options and there are probably some good cheap ones, too.

TagPro,3d6pcp,z_42,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:42:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it's clearly more skilled, I said that this lends credence to radius being more skilled.   That means that this data makes it more likely to be true that radius is more skilled. I think maybe you misunderstood.   Say you've only ever seen white sheets of paper. If you see another white sheet of paper it lends credence to all pieces of paper being white. That is objectively true, even if the amount by which it increases the probability of all paper being white is small.  Likewise, even if it's not really conclusive (or even close to conclusive) evidence that radius is more skilled, it is still evidence. I never said it was conclusive."
TagPro,3d6pcp,jazzcigarettes,3,Tue Jul 14 13:36:38 2015 UTC,The only thing that this lends credence to is that radius has slightly longer games. It's a leap to say that it's based on a higher skill level. Maybe people who play radius are more inclined to wait until full. It's also less active at night so waiting for a full game would be more common. You can't really infer anything about skill level on servers from this information.   I've pubbed a good amount on every American server besides centra and they're all the same in terms of level of the player base.
TagPro,3d6pcp,sad_day_friends,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:20:18 2015 UTC,Yeah but if griefseeds plays on radius and he's the best then that means that radius is the best server statistically because he's so far ahead of everyone else in skill that he pulls us up
TagPro,3d6pcp,z_42,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:33:27 2015 UTC,"That leap is fine to disagree with (downvoting not a disagree button but w/e), as you're right, it's unclear. But it sounded like you thought the difference was small enough so as to not matter.  EDIT: on an slightly unrelated note, your personal experience is only anecdotal evidence ... it seems unlikely (based on other video games such as League of Legends, in which skill varies significantly from region to region) that TagPro would be immune to this regional difference."

Even with the larger-than-real-life vanilla buttons, the ball is still on the gate but not touching the button.  To make it simpler, if it is possible to do it in one direction, it should be possible the other way.

Eventually league interest got bigger then we got it increased to 12. It has been pegged at these numbers because the devs have picked numbers that ""seem like a good limit"" based on demand.  IIRC spectating has a significantly less impact on the server capacity than a player does. So increasing it shouldn't have much of an impact.   But a developer will need to weigh in on this and if it is viable. I'd recommend engaging with a dev directly. Either through Reddit, IRC, or their Github issues.

TagPro,3d5etn,DagNasty,15,Mon Jul 13 18:13:32 2015 UTC,"Because it's pubs and because it's harder to communicate is why you SHOULD do it in pubs and it will be more effective than in more serious games with communication.   If the other team could communicate more easily, they'd say ""that's a cap, stay back and don't let them get a grab off"" and there wouldn't be much reason to delay barring any time-management strategies.   In a pub, the individual players are all thinking ""what's going on, did a teammate hit him and slow him down? Should I go try to get the return or stay in base?"" They don't know what to do and can't quickly assign roles for some to stay and some to go, so there is a better chance that balls are going to be out of place allowing for another easy opportunity after the cap."
TagPro,3d5etn,qtface,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:21:18 2015 UTC,"Of course it will be less effective in a competitive match vs. a pub game but it still going to be used in them regardless. In a pub there are far too many variables at play to really make it successful. The quality of your team is going to be a crapshoot and unless you have a good idea of the players in your game, you're better off just getting the cap.     A lot of times pubs can be like herding cats. One minute you're playing D and have 2 other team mates with you so you go off to help on offense only to have the other 2 follow and leave the flag.    There's really no right or wrong here, it is a legitimate tactic but I think you need to read the situation and weigh the factors in before you apply it. I generally play with stats off and try not to take pubs too seriously so my opinion may be skewed"

That being said, Selkie refused to chase the new enemy FC and instead fucked with their own FC.  This is blatantly working against own team, and clearly more bannable than anything the FC did here.  Edit:  Looking at this again, I set a ban on Selkie.  If you think your FC is being a dick, tell them, maybe report them and let us know.  The way this payed out, Some Ball 10 grabbed the flag, Selkie continued to interrupt his teams FC rather than chase the opponents FC.

If say, you managed to get a good grab and had an amazing escape while juking all 4 enemies, would you be okay if I purposely boosted into you to make it a little more of a challenge because I find it fun?"

TagPro,3d5etn,--wut--,0,Tue Jul 14 09:56:23 2015 UTC,"Showboating is not strategic at all. Every showboater says that to justify it, but  it's only a taunt and they know it. Nothing more, nothing less. When someone showboats, it annoys the other team (obviously). They let up a cap and now they gotta watch the FC taunt them as he caps. The FC's other teammates are usually also annoyed. As a defender, I'm always annoyed when my own FC showboats. I'm even more annoyed when the FC gets sniped because of his showboat. What Selkie did was not right, but neither was what the FC did. If tow people did something wrong, you can't just ban one."
TagPro,3d5etn,TheRealA_Tom,-7,Tue Jul 14 05:11:45 2015 UTC,I don't think you should ban Selkie and not ban the showboater. What Selkie did in response to his own FC is no more working against own team than what the FC did. The FC deserves his teammates preventing the cap for acting like a child.
TagPro,3d5etn,TragicElmo,8,Tue Jul 14 02:49:46 2015 UTC,"The show boater did what they consider to be a legitimate strategy. It was not the final cap of the game, so as mods we don't interfere with this behavior unless it is horrible clear that it was wrong.   Selkie on the other hand pushed his FC away from the flag, and clearly continued to do so after their own flag was taken. That is working against on multiple levels."
TagPro,3d5etn,bizkut,-3,Tue Jul 14 03:44:25 2015 UTC,"Disagree with the ban. This will justify the real showboaters to be more dick and unsportsmanship-like towards other teams. Now my suggestion to my own team ""It's better to cap than to get blind sniped""/""Let's try not to be dick to the other team"" will be met with more derision and ""I'm waiting for my own team's re""/""I'm lagging""/""Don't tell me what to do"". Maybe pubbing is more intolerable these days with summer break than the usual, but the immaturity I see on pub really turns me off.  Plus, it appears Selkie only did it in response to TORRES's action. True, his action is not justifiable, but I would suggest looking at Selkie's previous record and determine if Selkie really goes out of his way to spam/WAOT on his own. If he's been good, the short moment of his justifiable rage will get him banned? I feel terrible for him."
TagPro,3d5etn,ko890317,2,Tue Jul 14 03:05:04 2015 UTC,"If Selkie had pushed their FC away but chased when Some Ball 10 grabbed, then things would be different. I banned because they continued to block their FC into others while they let the enemy FC get away. They not only blocked their own FC, but also let the other get away. Maybe if they had chased after giving their FC a ""you're a dick"" love tag I wouldn't have banned. They didn't though. They actively continued to screw their team over after the situation had fully changed. And you can see them move to do it after SB10 grabbed. There is nothing to really debate there."

TagPro,3d5etn,Buttersnack,3,Tue Jul 14 00:33:18 2015 UTC,"I mean. I agree with you. It looks pretty intentional that your teammate kept you from capping. I would never attempt to push my own FC away from the flag.  But if a person doesn't see your move as strategy, they see it being a dick. And then they attempt to take matters into their own hands."
TagPro,3d5etn,Soccer21x,12,Tue Jul 14 00:35:53 2015 UTC,He also intentionally kept himself from capping
TagPro,3d5etn,Buttersnack,13,Mon Jul 13 18:18:59 2015 UTC,"The thing with the position he was in is that as long as he's paying attention there's no way for him to get popped. There's no boost that would come in fast enough for him to move right such a small amount.  As mentioned, it is a strategy. With the time spent waiting he forces the red team to come 'chase' not knowing he's already right there. He's also allowing his team to set up for regrab."
TagPro,3d5etn,Soccer21x,9,Mon Jul 13 18:25:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's a strategy, but it's a terrible one. You may be giving your team time to get a re, but that also gives the opponents time to get an anti re, which most good players would have done in this situation. Also, take a 100% chance at a cap over a 99% chance any day of the week; this is far from the first time we've seen something like this backfire."
TagPro,3d5etn,DatBlizzard,3,Mon Jul 13 18:30:22 2015 UTC,And that's where you and I are on the exact same page. 100% vs 99%. I choose 100%. I especially don't think the potential benefits outweigh the potential of not getting a cap.

Against a team of Some Balls who clearly weren't smart (or aware) enough to stay on anti-re, it seems like it would've been a very effective strategy. Also, it's not like he's circling around his flag and being stupid about it, he's sitting a pixel or two away waiting for more red balls to appear so he can cap knowing his team's regrab is safe."
TagPro,3d5etn,asdfsdfasdfadf,4,Mon Jul 13 18:36:26 2015 UTC,Please. He kept himself from capping for a few moments with the intention of capping at the best time. Selkie intended to kill OP and never let him cap. Big difference.

TagPro,3d5etn,nlfn,4,Mon Jul 13 18:47:01 2015 UTC,That's what I'm saying... 'Can we all realise that this is NOT showboating..'
TagPro,3d5etn,ZippityZoppity,8,Mon Jul 13 22:26:20 2015 UTC,I think the answer is no. You'll never have everyone agree.  There's usually more variables in place. I said in another comment that you're safe here. But in some other maps there's a chance someone can boost and get you before you realize what's happening.  This is usually a safe bet. But if something were to happen and you didn't get the cap it immediately looks like showboating and you're the reason you didn't get the cap.
TagPro,3d5etn,Arfie99,9,Tue Jul 14 00:06:25 2015 UTC,I'm psyched to see people think this is a viable strategy in pubs because I'm smart enough to play anti-re when I recognize an enemy fc is past four.   All you're giving yourself is a chance to lose both the cap AND regrab instead of getting a sure cap and potential regrab.
TagPro,3d5etn,Clue_Balls,2,Mon Jul 13 18:32:01 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this. It seems like people aren't thinking of the long term consequences of playing this strategy.  I mean hey, maybe it will shift things for tagpro, but I doubt that slow-capping every seriously takes off."

TagPro,3d5etn,lolugrumpy,19,Mon Jul 13 21:53:43 2015 UTC,"By waiting, he was letting his teammates get set up better for regrab. He also is more likely to get the immediate return on red's grab since they'll be coming at full speed trying to get the return and make a bad grab instead of waiting for a good opportunity to grab."
TagPro,3d5etn,TPStalin,16,Tue Jul 14 03:33:27 2015 UTC,"I really get annoyed when people say stuff like that ""isn't showboating"". Yes it is. You aren't setting your teammate up for a better grab because in pubs you don't have the level of communication needed to have another player go for the grab at the moment you cap. Also, in public games there is no need for anything close to timing grabs because the defense is usually bad at best  You could argue that he was waiting for regrab to be set up, but there were only three people on his screen, which would lead me to believe the other guy was already on regrab  edit: If the intention wasn't to showboat then REAL TORRES either slowed down the cap in a circumstance that would hurt his regrab, OR recognized that the other team was bad and wouldn't put a player on prevent, which I think is possible but I doubt anybody would think that far ahead in game"
TagPro,3d5etn,udrinkbullsemen,37,Mon Jul 13 17:45:37 2015 UTC,"Seriously?  By the end of this gif, all 4 red players are on screen.  If he had capped instantly, at best his regrab would have had a few defenders in range to contain him.  As it was, his teammate should have had an easy out.  Meanwhile, there's almost no risk to this move (other than a teammate who is obviously actually working against his own team), because there are no off-screen boosts or bombs that can be taken to return him by surprise."
TagPro,3d5etn,TPStalin,4,Mon Jul 13 18:01:26 2015 UTC,"The red players were in the gif at the end of the clip, meaning they weren't trying to actively prevent the second grab. They were running out of base, which would've given regrab an out. Everytime you catch defense out of position you can either grab or cap, and all of the some balls were moving towards blue base in the clip  edit: No my timing is off, you are right, they would've still been in base. My fault :/"
TagPro,3d5etn,udrinkbullsemen,9,Mon Jul 13 18:17:02 2015 UTC,"When he was waiting by the flag, there was only 1 red in sight and going after him. Waiting a bit made the other red to all catch up and put the regrab in a better spot to grab. But by the time all of red had shown up for blue regrab to get out with an easy grab, he was being blocked by his teammate."
TagPro,3d5etn,Clue_Balls,3,Mon Jul 13 18:22:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah my bad, the other guy was completely right. To be honest if OP really was trying to slow the cap and not showboat, it would've worked. But it should never work. If there is one decent player on the other team the fc just gave them a good four seconds to set up a prevent and completely fucked over the regrab by misreading when is a good time to go for a slowed cap."
TagPro,3d5etn,TPStalin,10,Mon Jul 13 18:27:36 2015 UTC,"No it shouldn't work, but its a pub and people are dumb, so it will a surprising amount of times lol."
TagPro,3d5etn,tamouq,10,Mon Jul 13 18:32:54 2015 UTC,"It's not just about your own regrab, it's also about baiting the other team into grabbing poorly so you can get the easy return."
TagPro,3d5etn,TPStalin,2,Mon Jul 13 18:38:17 2015 UTC,"I don't like that mindset. It's going for a cheeky and risky return when the focus should be on maximizing the chance for the regrab to get out.   Slowing a cap is completely legitimate in cases where you have communication and the right environment, but using a justification of popping the guy chasing works in even more specific circumstances to the point where the benefits arguably don't outweigh the possible costs.  I think you're right, but the circumstances where that would work would require a disciplined team and practice so things don't get messed up  edit: I posted the comment with a sentence just stopping in the middle, fixed :D"
TagPro,3d5etn,tamouq,9,Mon Jul 13 18:42:05 2015 UTC,"Regardless of the viability of doing it in a pub, who cares? Are people actually get angry because a guy stopped before capping with strategic reasoning behind why he was doing it? They certainly shouldn't."
TagPro,3d5etn,TPStalin,6,Mon Jul 13 18:24:48 2015 UTC,"I mean I'm saying how somebody could see it as showboating and get mad over it.

It's their own fault for not being educated on the matter. If they want to go through the trouble of typing out a nasty comment to me in the game, for doing someone strategic, good. I'll gladly cap again right in front of their AFK face and win the game."

TagPro,3d5etn,TPStalin,4,Mon Jul 13 18:47:05 2015 UTC,"Because it's pubs and because it's harder to communicate is why you SHOULD do it in pubs and it will be more effective than in more serious games with communication.   If the other team could communicate more easily, they'd say ""that's a cap, stay back and don't let them get a grab off"" and there wouldn't be much reason to delay barring any time-management strategies.   In a pub, the individual players are all thinking ""what's going on, did a teammate hit him and slow him down? Should I go try to get the return or stay in base?"" They don't know what to do and can't quickly assign roles for some to stay and some to go, so there is a better chance that balls are going to be out of place allowing for another easy opportunity after the cap.   You don't need to time the regrab, regrab just needs to sit on regrab and be regrab for regrab. It's about pulling away the other team.    I doubt anybody would think that far ahead in game   Stalin we know you don't think about how your actions affect the game but some people do, sweetheart."
TagPro,3d5etn,MostDeaths,2,Mon Jul 13 18:46:33 2015 UTC,"I mean it's really, really easy to think ""Oh look, the other three players are leaving base and the offender is in front of all three. I'll stay here and play prevent."" In fact I think anybody with league experience would do it (or should).  You don't have to assign roles. When you play a lot you recognize where you should be based on where you spawn or where you are currently or what others are doing  Not really sure if you are being jokingly condescending or what, but you're really wrong. In fact, I ran into the same situation pubbing two days ago and guess what I did when their FC got ahead of all of us? I stayed and played anti-re. Every time I pub people make the right call, it's not some crazy thing.  There's some ""lol pubs are shit"" rhetoric going around that I think is really dumb.

It's pretty hard to argue that delaying the cap in this specific situation wouldn't have given the blue team an advantage.

TagPro,3d5etn,TPStalin,12,Tue Jul 14 05:08:24 2015 UTC,"OP probably saw that regrab wasn't set up. If you wait a few more seconds, which he had, that puts 4 red out of position and a blue on regrab. Alternatively, I would argue that the blue player who blocked him was clearly working against team. If someone does this you record it and show it to the mods or report them. Blatantly blocking them IS working against team and ban-able."
TagPro,3d5etn,ThrashTP,9,Tue Jul 14 19:48:22 2015 UTC,"I think that's a pile of bullshit to be honest. The last blue player would've been on the flag tile or at most one tile off based on his position at the start of the clip, which is close enough to set up regrab efficiently. Red isn't stupid, if they have one competent person they'll run prevent when they realize he's going to cap, so a delayed cap here hurts the regrabber.   Edit: It would've worked, but is still dumb. What I wrote is what a team with one relatively experienced player should've done and is why the strat in general wouldn't work unless playing against bad players (but in that case do you even need to delay the cap? Just grab and leave base)."
TagPro,3d5etn,DaEvil1,8,Mon Jul 13 17:52:36 2015 UTC,"Red is 4 someballs who all swarm enemy base about the time the slow cap would have come, Doubt there is the awareness to play effective anti. Just my opinion though. Showboating on the 3rd cap should always be met with the death penalty."
TagPro,3d5etn,TPStalin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:54:47 2015 UTC,"You're right. I commented before I realized in the clip all four rushed base. The showboat/strat/whatever 100% would have worked, but using it there should not have worked, because it gave the other team time to set up a prevent. But in this case all four didn't know what they should have been doing.  IF OP recognized the players were new and would chase even when he had a sure cap then it would work and be a decent strat, but you are betting your regrab on that. I just personally wouldn't unless I had communication with the FC  edit: Jesus, do I even know what grammar is?"

People have very different opinions here. So no, it's not clear.   Real-time, it looks a bit shaky. I honestly would have sided with selkie in game because I've seen a lot of showboating and this by all means looks identical to it. However, now that reals intentions are out there and we're not pumped full of adrenaline, we can say ""Oh, damn. Seems justifiable for slowcapping.""   And here we come. Full circle, I should have said ""stupid strategy."" Still an opinion. But anytime you are strategizing in a team game and your team isn't aware of your intentions, it leans more towards improvised risk than anything. Regrab is a general strategy, clowcapping to get a better regrab is not general strategy.   In pubs, try to keep things simple and shit like this generally wont happen.  It's as simple as ""get re.""    I'm not trying to at all justify one side or the other. I'm simply saying I understand why this happened and the easiest way to prevent it was to just cap. I've been known to run in circles with my thoughts. So i'm just kind of saying what immediately pops in my head in the hopes that it's comprehensible."

Gives more time for his team to get on regrab.  2.) Draws enemies away from their base (few pubbers play anti-re), giving his regrabbing teammate ample space to work with to try to get out.  3.) Forces defenders chasing at full speed to make bad grabs after he gets the cap, making them easy to return, improving his regrabber's chances of getting a subsequent cap."
TagPro,3d5etn,Clydas,0,Mon Jul 13 21:29:56 2015 UTC,"Even if it isn't showboating, it's unnecessary.  It's also disrespectful to your defenders.

A free grab doesn't mean much if their whole team is there waiting to prevent a cap. And your guy would've got the regrab anyway."

TagPro,3d5etn,ohnowait,5,Mon Jul 13 18:15:08 2015 UTC,I think what Eashy is saying is that his waiting was assuming his team is intelligent in pub play and setting up a regrab while simultaneously assuming the other team is stupid and not leaving someone on anti-re in a past 4 situation. His waiting right off the flag was making terrible assumptions about how one plays a competitive game.
TagPro,3d5etn,IvanEedle,3,Mon Jul 13 18:32:50 2015 UTC,"Right but his play of waiting was only detrimental to the team because of the guy blocking him off the flag.

My ""worst"" stat is DCs. My page says I'm 27,043rd though that's definitely lowballing it because the player pages are pretty inaccurate. I don't think it's really my worst, especially because I played a lot of matches at school with shitty internet.  As for this month, my best stat is prevent again (54th), and my worst is (I think, there's too many stat pages to go through) win%, (1372nd). I think that just says that I don't know when to quit. I have a tendency to get large losing streaks, especially if I face a really good player many times in a row. I lost seven in a row against d0pe last week.

TagPro,3d09pc,handsy_pilot,3,Sun Jul 12 18:14:34 2015 UTC,"Hand-off is one of the several new stats I've been computing using the Tagpro Analytics data (I will publish the stats soon).  What counts as hand-off is:   you die someone on your team grabs the flag within X seconds (regrab_time) that someone survives for Y seconds (survival_time)   This way, even capturing or dying far away from the enemy base can count as a hand-off, but I could compute a separate stat where only hand-offs in the traditional sense are counted (you grab & die rather quickly) - in fact, I will.    The key issue is what values should regrab_time and survival_time be. What is your suggestion?"
TagPro,3d09pc,Balka42,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:41:53 2015 UTC,"Awesome!  I have no idea what those values should be, maybe do a poll and see what the top players think?"
TagPro,3d09pc,FragrantFowl,2,Mon Jul 13 10:52:42 2015 UTC,"My idea for this requires coding a function to signal a handoff, which might be more trouble than it's worth. But just to get any idea out there, even bad ones:  You're setting up the attack on O. You have a team signal, some keyboard function you can press, that says ""i'm about to handoff"". You click it, make a grab, pop, and there's the regrab, within a set amount of time after the ""handoff signal"" is made. It seems to me you could then capture the stat."
TagPro,3d09pc,FuckWhereDidIThrowit,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:11:07 2015 UTC,"This would be abused a lot.  It would be to your advantage to signal a handoff everytime, If you get away, then you get away. If you get popped, it becomes a ""handoff"""
TagPro,3d09pc,FragrantFowl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:19:01 2015 UTC,"fair. but if there was some other way to count it statistically, it would also count it when it ""accidentally"" happened. It's not like they can count track intent. LS is good, but he's not nodes in my brain good."
TagPro,3d09pc,de_ash,3,Mon Jul 13 00:53:22 2015 UTC,a flag drop immediately followed by a grab   this also occurs during a regrab chain though. I think a pop inside the zone where you get prevent time would count as a handoff since it is more likely to be a handoff.
TagPro,3d09pc,crblanz,12,Sun Jul 12 15:50:23 2015 UTC,"flag hold of less than x seconds followed by an immediate grab, which lasts for at least y seconds"
TagPro,3d09pc,jwm5514,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:21:48 2015 UTC,If the first grab doesn't continue a chain of hold time then it is the beginning of a handoff.

Neutral flag is relatively new and isn't even in competitive which means there's a huge opening for new skills for teams. Center flag maps are being created more and more and gives new pub players a simpler game to witness and gain skills. It's also quite fun to have one flag carrier with the spot light. The jukes are great, the blocks are paramount, the positioning is crucial, and the potential tactics haven't even been tapped in competitive play.   edit: i added more stuff"

Also, i feel that there is a lot more strategy in CF, and CF maps are tons better designed than regular ones.  idk tho"

TagPro,3d2ip1,mmartinutk,0,Mon Jul 13 01:11:38 2015 UTC,Pretty much. The developers want to implement several modes in Next. We're expecting NF and CTF to be the core modes with ranked/pub modes within those. There may be something like a party mode as well with maps like Hockey and stuff. They haven't officially confirmed this yet because they're more focused on gameplay development right now. I'd be surprised if it weren't.

TagPro,3cxd5o,Kembangan,10,Sun Jul 12 12:25:23 2015 UTC,"I think if the MTC still picked the nominated maps like they do now, but instead of them also narrowing it down themselves they should have them in the rotation labeled as ""Test Map Rotation"", similar to ""Throwback Map Rotation"". Hopefully just take that whole rotation out while we're at it. If a map is out of date enough to be taken out of rotation, it should have to be updated then voted back in. Have links that direct to a Test Map Rotation subreddit where there's a thread for each map currently in the test rotation and let people discuss the maps, then vote in 2 and drop the rest for the new Test Map Rotation."
TagPro,3cxd5o,gorbachev,7,Sat Jul 11 18:24:18 2015 UTC,"Let me preface this by saying I totally respect all the work the MTC does. They put in a lot of work and receive a lot more backlash than the deserve.  With that said, their biggest problem is that they allow 0 community involvement in their process. The MTC member and selection process is completely up to the members. I've always liked the idea of the MTC picking 3-4 top maps through rotation for a week to see the community's ratings and opinion on them. Also, good classic maps like Star, DZ, and Gamepad shouldn't be able to be taken out on a whim. Games like CsGo have been using the same maps for 10 years, and people still play them religiously. Not only do those old maps spice up rotation, they help new players figure out new strategies and skills and let them see how maps have evolved.   If that isn't possible, another possible solution is to hold MTC public elections. For example, every 4-5 map threads the 2 MTC members with the lowest activity AND those that vote yes to rotation maps that community rates the lowest should have to reelection for their spot against other candidates. Each candidate could give an example of a map or two they made, discuss what their favorite map is, and what they want to do on the MTC. I think this make being an MTC member a pretty prestigious position and make some of the members start to go their own way in voting."
TagPro,3cxd5o,nostradumba55,15,Sat Jul 11 20:47:17 2015 UTC,"replying both to you and the guy below you.  okay, your biggest problem is utter bullshit. the map vote for removal is 50% community vote.  50%. that means if the map is near 100% liked, it is ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE to remove that map. you wanna know why the classic maps got taken out? cause people bitch about them. i personally think star and colors are two of the best maps that have been in rotation. guess what? public backlash caused them to be removed.  @UTB: that is not going to work.   the candidates that get voted in will ALL be ones advocating for whichever format of map is popular right now, and the rotation will follow suit. you will end up with a very very similar rotation, and that will suck.   secondly, quote me on this, mtc pushes innovation of maps. if you let the public influence map choices, the rotation will change much, much, much slower. the general public IS resistant to change, and will NOT put in even 1/10th the effort the members put in to look at potential maps.  one of the major problems the mtc used to have is the large workload: having to filter through maybe 200 maps to find maps that make it into the next round of testing. this is probably the most easily outsourced part of the process, and there have been attempts to do that. and you know what, each time those attempts failed. because the public simply doesn't actually care, they just bitch all day.  fuck all the haters. almost all of the maptesters are at least in the top 5% in terms of being map savvy, and put in more effort thinking about maps than 99% of non mtc members.   edit: start to go their own way in vote?! are you. fucking. kidding. me.   the moment the mtc makes a decision contrary to public opinion (keep GoS in rotation for ONE MORE WEEK, removed FUCKING HYPERREACTOR, WHICH EVERYONE BITCHED ABOUT FOR A MONTH THEN WHEN IT CAME BACK IN THROWBACK ROTATION EVERYONE BITCHED IT WAS SHIT), they get bitched at. i quit the mtc because it was a: a shit ton of work, b: the worst fucking job i've ever had the displeasure of doing, it was like herding a bunch of cats that verbally abuse you as they do whatever they fucking please. i was sick of making voting decisions that were against public opinion, and being part of the reason the mtc gets hated on."
TagPro,3cxd5o,Kembangan,2,Sun Jul 12 09:47:15 2015 UTC,"As just a pub player, thanks for all your work with the mtc creating good rotations. I generally feel like there's a good mix of map/play styles in rotation that keeps the game fresh enough that I can play endlessly. Sure, they're not all my favorite, but if there wasn't a decent mix, I'd get tired of the maps I love right now."
TagPro,3cxd5o,DaEvil1,2,Mon Jul 13 04:56:23 2015 UTC,"I see your concerns, but still think the only way to solve those is give the public some involvement. Want the MTC to get less flak for their decisions? Let the community have some decisions in the map so they have themselves to blame. Want a higher rated rotation? Let the public decide which maps they want by playing them first.  Like you said, mapmakers are pretty savvy on how maps will play. At least let them get a vote in the process. In a position where there's really no qualifications, people are gonna disagree loudly with the MTC until they get some input in the process."
TagPro,3cxd5o,OnceUponaDome,5,Sun Jul 12 19:43:38 2015 UTC,"Input is basically map ratings. I'm going to say this again: map ratings count as 50% vote when considering which maps get taken out.   In case that wasn't clear: map ratings count as 50% vote when considering which maps get taken out.   With regards to which maps get put in, I'm sorry, how many hours a week do you spend looking at other people's maps?   When fez tried organizing a public map testing process, the mtc agreed to be very earnest in considering its opinions. But alas, the work wasn't done, NO CONCRETE RATINGS OF MAPS WERE GIVEN TO US, and we moved on.   How do you want the public to contribute to the mtc process? Let the number of upvotes decide which maps get into rotation? The mtc is short on members, almost all good mapmakers have been considered for addition to the mtc in the past few months.   What exactly do you want?  Edit: I am not currently part of the mtc. I am simply bitching about how shitty it was to be on it. My views don't reflect those of mtc members."
TagPro,3cxd5o,DaEvil1,6,Sun Jul 12 20:48:32 2015 UTC,"Want the MTC to get less flak for their decisions?   Why would we want this if it is at the expence of the quality of the maps in rotation? I think there is value in adding community input, but at the moment it's really hard to distinguish the basis on that input. I'd love to have the public maptest on their own, and give feedback, but unless that is actually implemented into the game itself, it's not as valuable due to:   People tend to judge maps based on how they look rather than how they play (this is mostly connected with that it's easier to just look at something and make a judgement call rather than go through the effort of testing it) There's little opportunity to differentiate between opinions based on people playing the map rather than opinions based on looking at a map. Not every opinions validity is equal, and a lot of the times it's hard to differentiate what an opinion is based on (especially if it's a short comment, or a number rating, or an upvote). People are resistant to change if they can avoid it. And I personally think the longevity of the game (which will be longer IMO if we facilitate for newer concepts, and different approaches that may not be popular at the moment) is more important than a slight dip in comfort level from current players    Also why are mapmakers special*? I think there's quality input to be had from pretty much all groupings within TagPro (elite players, new players, mapmakers, veterans, commisioners, voulenteers, streamers etc.) They can all contribute their unique point of view. But as I said, I would really prefer that input to be had from people playing the maps (preferably in 4v4 situations), which probably isn't going to happen since TagPro is featured locked.  * personally I look for peoples opinions on maps all over the place, which includes a lot of mapmaking opinions from r/tagprotesting, so the opinions of mapmakers are definitely seen quite a lot."
TagPro,3cxd5o,Kembangan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:58:30 2015 UTC,"why are mapmakers special?   Speaking as a mapmaker, the actual process of making and refining a map teaches you about what works and what doesn't in a map.  ^ ....is what you would expect to hear from mapmakers. But what I would say is that it's not just the process of making a map that teaches mapmakers about what maps are good and what aren't, it's that they're always hearing feedback on their maps, and on other people's maps. Learning from other people makes you think about the more intricate parts of map design that you might not have even considered until then.   At first people will tell you about having enough grabbing mechanisms, then balancing chasiness etc etc. I, personally, have gotten to a point where immediately when i see a map I run through a checklist of questions: Would it be chasey? Could resets ever occur? Is there potential for boost/bomb camping? Is it overly complex or simple? Now, I'm no expert mapmaker or map judge, but I think that having made maps and heard so much feedback, I've come to learn quite a bit about the process.   So I would say yes, mapmakers have an edge over your everyday ball looking at an unfortunate-maps preview link. That is not to say that to be a good judge of a map you must have mapmaking experience, it's just that being a mapmaker gives you a pretty solid understanding of what does and doesn't work on a map. What direction should the MTC take future public rotation? I have no idea! What makes for an entertaining game to watch? Not a clue! What kinds of maps make for a good challenge at the competitive level? I haven't the foggiest. That's where the others you mentioned come in."
TagPro,3cxd5o,Tnels,2,Mon Jul 13 02:49:23 2015 UTC,"Sure mapmakers have a unique perspective, but that isn't to say their perspective applied would automatically make for a better rotation. People who have no clue about how to talk about maps and analyze them, could be just as valuable by having an instinct for telling a successful map from others. Ther's obviously a reason a lot of mapmakers are on the committee, but there's also a reason a lot of members are not mapmakers as well. And that is because while mapmaking is valuable experience in terms of mapjudging, it can color your vision too much in a certain direction, and it ignores how well suited you are in terms of judging a map from a perspective outside of mapmaking where others may very well excel."

Considering I'm on the MTC and have kept up with bowtie's anti-MTC stance, I would love to know which maps other than Rush bowtie is upset about not making rotation. Like, I would love to be linked to the maps that he feels so strongly about that didn't get in.  Last I heard from bowtie the mapmaker was frustration when our 4v4 test on Rush didn't go well. Rush was his last map, and it was a map he was convinced should have been a lock for rotation and considered for MLTP.

Look at all of his versions of Rush -- he hardly takes any of our criticism and barely changes elements of his map.  That holds true for all of his maps, actually.

The principle states that among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. Other, more complicated solutions may ultimately prove to provide better predictions, but—in the absence of differences in predictive ability—the fewer assumptions that are made, the better.

The motions of the sun, moon and other solar system planets can be calculated using a geocentric model (the earth is at the center) or using a heliocentric model (the sun is at the center). Both work, but the geocentric system requires many more assumptions than the heliocentric system, which has only seven.

TagPro,3cxd5o,OnceUponaDome,15,Sat Jul 11 17:58:34 2015 UTC,"The problem is not with the MTC's system. It used to be, but over the course of the last 5 months, they have drastically improved their map selection process.    If I understand correctly, every thread, each MTC member rates every map from the map thread on a scale of 1-5. Then, they average out all the members' map ratings to find the best maps. The MTC then posts these ""final selection"" maps in a thread on /r/TagPro to give the community a chance to give their input. Over the course of the following week, these maps can be tweaked to fix any perceived problems, and then the MTC selects the ones they deem fit for rotation.    As for map removal, the MTC also rates every rotation map on a scale of 1-5. After averaging out their ratings, they add in the community map ratings found on the home page of TagPro to determine which maps are collectively deemed as the most dispensable.      In my humble opinion, the issue with the map committee is their judgement. Although much less than in the past, I still find myself disagreeing with the MTC's opinions on maps way too often. At the end of the day, though, they're the ones putting in the hard work, and opinions are subjective, so I think we should all cut them some slack.    That said, I agree with Bowtie."
TagPro,3cxd5o,3z_,3,Sat Jul 11 18:16:23 2015 UTC,"That's sort of our process. There's actually more testing between when we play each map and when we announce the top maps, and the voting system is out of ten (not that that makes a difference). I agree that things have improved a lot, not just with the MTC but also with the mapmaking community. I used to be pretty critical of the whole process, but almost everything has improved greatly in the past months."
TagPro,3cxd5o,OnceUponaDome,5,Sat Jul 11 20:30:13 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the only qualifier to be on the MTC is to be cosy with the existing members of MTC. Thats it.   There was some discussion on how members of the MTC are selected here. How applicants get on with existing members may matter more than it should, but according to the MTC that isn't the only factor.   Take ""flame"", in which the MTC were shocked it was hated. The public do not care about how much you like the mapmaker, only the quality of the map itself.   Any evidence that they added Flame to rotation based purely on the mapmakers? As far as I can see, they thought it was fun, the public disagreed, and they removed it from rotation pretty promptly.   First weekend of each month, the top ten voted maps of the new map thread are put in rotation, no old maps. The public votes on those maps over the weekend, top 3 get into full rotation. Whichever 3 are the lowest voted of the old maps, get removed. easy.   I don't think that's necessarily a great system. The top ten maps are going to be voted on almost completely based on how they look; you're deluding yourself if you think the vast majority of players are going to try out each map (which is what each member of the MTC apparently does). It would lead to maps that are immediately easy to play entering rotation, anything that requires practice, or requires players to adjust their playing style would almost certainly be dismissed, there isn't time for that in a single weekend. Also, your previous complaint was that the MTC is biased towards certain mapmakers; do you seriously think the Tagpro community would be much better?   And importantly, make peoples map votes reset to ask again once a month, else map voting is pointless on a kneejerk first impression.   I'd actually agree with this completely. Not only is it just based on first impressions, but the ratings of people who stopped playing months back are still taken into account (unless there's some sort of reset procedure I don't know about)."

At the end of a match I'm usually to wrapped up in the game to remember about voting unless I'm given some sort of prompt."
TagPro,3cxd5o,3z_,3,Sun Jul 12 01:13:39 2015 UTC,"the only qualifier to be on the MTC is to be cosy with the existing members of MTC.   I got on the maptest committee because I was very prominent in the mapmaking scene. I started up /r/tagpromapsharing, and gave feedback on as many of the maps as I could each time a map thread came around. The only member I was ""cozy"" with was asdf, but DaEvil1 was the person who PM'ed me on Reddit asking if I wanted to join anyway.  I was actually incredibly critical of the MTC until I joined (actually, I'm still very critical of it), so I wouldn't be surprised if I was rather unliked by the committee.   So the whole map rotation is decided by a group that the playing public has zero control over.   The thing with MTC, is that unlike league commissions (which I'm familiar with since I did OLTP for three seasons), it's not just about what opinions you have, and what you think is best for the league. It's about your knowledge of maps overall, knowing what a ""good"" or a ""bad"" map is from spending 5 minutes running around on it, being able to discuss in a rumpus room that is our maptest sessions, and being able to accept that you are wrong, which league commissioners typically don't do. (I'm kidding please don't kill me)   unlike when the mtc ignores public map votes to continually keep hated maps in   Our process for map removal is simple: every member of the committee votes on the map between 1-10. We then take the rating from the /maps page and recalculate it so that it also produces a number between 1-10 for each map.  We then combine those scores together to produce a completely new number. Once we've done that for every map, the bottom five ranked maps will be voted on for removal.  Fun fact by the way: the MTC's given public rotation an average vote of 6.85, while the community's average vote of the rotation is 7.6. This essentially means the community is happier with the rotation than the committee is.   Take ""flame"", in which the MTC were shocked it was hated.   I can't speak for the other members, but I wasn't shocked it was hated. I was surprised that the green gate didn't get used that much (difficult enough for us to predict as is), but when that was such a large part of the appeal for the map for us, it's no surprise that that would lead to the community not liking it. That's why it was removed a short time after.   The public do not care about how much you like the mapmaker   Here comes the mapmaker-bias argument again, and my simple rebuttal is to look at the maps we've added recently, and see which ones have been added by first-time mapmakers, and which ones have been added by ""veteran"" mapmakers.  From thread 40-50, for example, 9/18 maps that have been added have been from authors getting their first map in public rotation (Monarch, Pilot, Frontdoor, Renegade, Angry Pig, Kite, Draft, Ultradrive, Platypus).   And importantly, make peoples map votes reset to ask again once a month   Yes, everyone on the MTC agrees this would be a good idea. I asked Ankh about it officially, and he said he would bring it up with the other devs, but they may be reluctant to erase a butt-load of collected data."

Also, you would likely be an exception to this.   It's just that, imo, whenever this point is brought up it's because people don't see much contribution from mtc members in map threads and the like. I'm not going to name specific members, but there are certain ones that are noticeably absent from public mapmaking discussions. For all I know, they could be the wisest members on the committee but without showing that publicly, it gets lost on people. Now of course, this is an unpaid position with very few benefits and a lot of responsibilities, so not contributing every thread or spending inordinate amounts of time giving feedback is totally reasonable. But at the same time, I believe there are people who would be willing to put in that time and that effort and they are being held back by the barrier to entry into the MTC. I'm not suggesting you kick out those who don't participate publicly, but I see no reason why the MTC can't bring on more people.

That's true, and I think that's the biggest issue we (the MTC) faces right now, and I hope to work hard to combat that.  It's funny though; every single MTC applicant we had during our hiring phase said, first and foremost, they would try and give feedback as much as possible on each thread -- and you know how many of those people actually do it? Even counting ones who didn't get selected on the committee?  Zilch.  I'm guilty of it too. I remember saying that I would do it when I'm on the committee.

When a MTC member gives feedback on a map, the mapmaker takes that advice nine times out of ten. Sometimes despite the mapmaker actually not being sure about the changes made. That's a little too much power over other people's craft for my liking.  And just because you satisfy my tastes with a couple changes doesn't necessarily mean you're helping your chances at rotation. I'm only one vote out of eight, so it's possibly I could be the only person wanting to see that specific change.

TagPro,3cyti4,Saylur,-2,Sun Jul 12 05:35:15 2015 UTC,yikes.
TagPro,3cyti4,teiyi,-2,Sun Jul 12 22:16:29 2015 UTC,Ban appeals are useless tagpro mods do nothing every thing is set up to auto ban at a point and good luck getting actual reviews on your ban. ooops did i state my true opinion mb. I haven't had many problems since I started playing radius though... origin why u ppl love the report button you dang report-o-holics
TagPro,3cyti4,cmz1973,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:17:03 2015 UTC,"I remember you from your earlier days. I even banned you once for offensive chat. So if I banned you, how can you argue that we do nothing? You havnt been banned in a over 2000 hours. So it looks like you have altered the behavior that was getting you banned. kinda seems like the mods did fairly well in your situation.  Just sayin."
TagPro,3cyti4,teiyi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:36:48 2015 UTC,Well I'm glad that I was remember-able ... er not rly. Anyways I'm sure you pay attention to ppl who have been troublesome but I just don't like how as a someball (ya ya shut up about being a someball and just log in) if im blocking really well and getting returns then sligthly tap our fc coming into base because I was pushed back from a block or i got a return then they ran into me how I can't get the stupid 15seconds between games removed becuase the report-aholics on origin love that button so much. I guess its not the mods but the appeal process that I have more problems with sry bout blaming mods. I hope this clears up what I'm complaining about.
TagPro,3cyti4,TP_Kermit69,-1,Sun Jul 12 18:20:13 2015 UTC,"The mod i had at my house the other day was extremely thorough, he even watched the players ip for an hour or so to make sure he wasn't ban evading… so to say the mods don't do anything is bullshit."
TagPro,3cyti4,teiyi,2,Sun Jul 12 17:00:53 2015 UTC,sry its not the mods fault that I can't talk to them until I have a full ban and by that point there's not much chance of actually getting it removed.
TagPro,3cyti4,TP_Kermit69,-1,Sun Jul 12 18:24:53 2015 UTC,do you even IRC?
TagPro,3cyti4,teiyi,2,Sun Jul 12 19:43:18 2015 UTC,"Is that the stupid program that ""can"" talk to mods but never loads and when I look for help all I find is complaints other people have about it instead of how to use it? I tried on like 3 different computers and never got it to work if that's what your talking about, but I'm not sure if that's IRC so no, I suppose I don't IRC."

You can even tell that he ducks touching the 3rd blue ball, the only one I didn't get a block on, and the one that made the tag. Even if he just nudges him, we probably have time enough for the cap. I took the line I did, going up slightly, because I assumed he'd block the bottom most ball. Tailor made cap. Perfect. Beautiful. And then. There's just me laughing."

TagPro,3ctpiw,SamSims-,24,Sat Jul 11 03:12:20 2015 UTC,"I liked the older ones better! The best thing about watts were how you used to make funny stories out of the clips syncing them with music to make it even better and it was really quickfire so it never got boring, this just feels like a 23 minute long montage :/  Still a great job with the editing, you have an incredible talent for it!  Edit: Could you link me to the bit in it where I get rekt, I don't have time to finish watching it yet? :D"
TagPro,3ctpiw,Aeginnt,13,Fri Jul 10 18:59:09 2015 UTC,"There's only so much you can do without repeating yourself, I've spent a lot of time trying to find a perfect soundtrack for single clips but it proved to be more difficult than before. I understand you perfectly, in fact I've tried to replace the 'regular' parts from the previous watts like normal caps  with something more unusual, for example nubsteps. I've also had much more fun making the longer segments since they felt more complete compared to one off clips. I thought about splitting it in parts but I felt it would look like karma whoring. Maybe it would've been better though.  Edit: I think you may have escaped this one without a scratch, although there's always this."
TagPro,3ctpiw,Punster7007,5,Fri Jul 10 19:08:23 2015 UTC,Don't get me wrong my comment is more a compliment to how good you are at making these things! I get you tried to mix it up. I'm not saying its bad its just not as good as its predecessors which were arguably the two best montages in TagPro history. It had a lot to live up too :D.

TagPro,3cydsj,Buttersnack,3,Sat Jul 11 23:56:51 2015 UTC,The fact that you can't see players in that area makes it even more your fault
TagPro,3cydsj,iTagPro,8,Sun Jul 12 19:59:56 2015 UTC,"The best chance of getting a cap (in either CTF or NF) is by keeping distance from your opponents. Even though you saw that guy coming in from the top, you had plenty of space to boost or juke.  And the most dangerous thing is walking back to their endzone.  But your team should've recognised the situation and gone to help you out, which Big Mac tried to do because he had the right idea to help block and help you escape but it was just a little too late.  Overall, you should have taken that boost up to the top, but your team should have gone to your position (or somewhere abouts) to help.   Your fault 75%, Big Mac 5%, rest of team 20%"

TagPro,3cydsj,IAmNateHello,0,Sun Jul 12 13:11:23 2015 UTC,"I did tell them all to go re, let me hash it out. I would say team should have blocked them coming in, given a warning or at least hold gate.  You are absolutely right with my screwups, but once I cut back to their endzone and saw all four of them, I think that was my best route, no?"
TagPro,3cydsj,strongamonga,2,Sun Jul 12 14:59:16 2015 UTC,"Telling them to get re was the wrong move on that map since it's difficult to suicide the flag back to the middle. You needed to have some other teammates come back to help block or tag someone who might tag you. Big mac coming back was the right move.  Now had you not been standing still in the beginning to say ""get re"" (the 100% wrong move for your teammates) you would  have been able to spike yourself on the blue portal area. Given that you did, you should have boosted up the left as even if you're tagged, there's a higher chance of not losing. Given that you didn't and went right instead, you should have gone down and to the right rather than cutting through the endzone, so that your team might get back. You'll probably die, but at the bottom of the map rather than in the goal area.  Now, mac did mess up a tad as he should have veered left and hoped to hit kermit so you might escape, but you already screwed up so much you can't complain about his minor error."
TagPro,3cydsj,bartimaeusjr,5,Sun Jul 12 18:22:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the whole team. You have no business being cute there when you can't suicide easily and everyone else should know that someone is needed behind the FC as safeguard at pretty much all times."
TagPro,3cydsj,ReadsStuff,8,Sun Jul 12 02:32:31 2015 UTC,"Nah, 90% steve at least. There's no real circumstance where that's a safe line of play. Boost up to top left. Then, even if you die, there's time to set up defence. If remo had gone further right initially, you'd have conceded a cap regardless of big mac."

TagPro,3cydsj,rupay,2,Mon Jul 13 15:14:40 2015 UTC,"everyone's fault, but Big Mac tried to redeem himself. The mindset of play on that map is 100% different than any other map in the history of Tagpro. There is a huge ""danger zone"" (make an imaginary line from the red gate to the boost above it; everything the the left of that line is the danger zone). if the flag is in the danger zone, the entire red team should be too. as the fc, u should've been trying to get out of there ASAP. your team shouldn't have listened to you when you said get re. Big Mac tried to come back, but he came a little early and blocked you instead of kermit. your entire team should've been back there ready to block or tag whoever tags you."
TagPro,3cydsj,Clydas,2,Sun Jul 12 20:32:57 2015 UTC,Yours almost entirely. You shouldn't try to suicide on those team tiles unless you're already right next to them. Going towards them when opponents will always be going towards them at full speed (and coming from off-screen) is a terrible idea.  Boost to the upper left.

Then we get together for a pre-top maps 4v4 test session where we test the top ranking maps from our initial rankings plus any maps we feel strongly about that didn't score well. This lasts 2-3 hours total.  Then we'll have a post-top maps 4v4 test session where we only test the 8 or so maps that made top maps. This also usually lasts 2-3 hours.  And yeah, it's pretty much understood among us that any asymmetrical map would undergo very extensive testing prior to making rotation. As in more testing than the normal map would.

TagPro,3cs8nk,3z_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:54:24 2015 UTC,You should make that post. It'd be refreshing from the posts where people shit on the maps.
TagPro,3cs8nk,xSuperstar,3,Sat Jul 11 10:39:44 2015 UTC,"From a mapmaker: I grow more tired of rotation too generally. I will say that Wombo Combo and Transilio feel like interesting newer maps, even if I don't love either of them. Some of the other new maps are depressingly simple or bland. In some cases just bad.  I think the non-symmetrical thing is much more prominent than it was before. The problem is, it hasn't caught on enough to really have any lasting effects on rotation.  Making a good asymmetrical map for rotation is extremely hard.  The best asymmetrical map that's ever been made (arguably, out of intentional cases) was Crabble.  Crabble had a great balance to it. With that said, it was extremely boring.  Making an asymmetrical map, with interesting details like other maps have, past just being balanced and asymmetrical, is probably not going to happen.  It could work a lot better in competitive for sure, with the side switching. I'm not going to act like I know that much about competitive though, or how the maps that get added to leagues like MLTP or ELTP are chosen.  If the TagPro community expands exponentially anytime soon (a la Next), I bet you will see some asymmetrical maps that make real cases for rotation, at least eventually."
TagPro,3cs8nk,3z_,7,Fri Jul 10 15:54:26 2015 UTC,"I've been an advocate of the segregation of PUB x LTP maps for a long time, and I think with leagues stagnating (and TPNext on the horizon), we're started to get to a point where that's viable.  However, I think asymmetry in (TagPro) maps is ultimately fundamentally flawed; even assuming perfect balance is possible in two different base designs, you still suffer the issue of how good a player is on each side on an individual level.  I often use the comparison between 45 and Boombox's base, because I think they're constructed similarly and are similarly balanced; so let's say we have a map design with Boombox's red base and 45's blue base (and for good measure, Holy See's mid -- just to paint a picture): the issue is, that I can play offence well on one of those maps, and fairly averagely on the other. If I play O on 45, I'll do very well! But if I play O on Boombox, I will struggle more.   As such, my chance of winning will be entirely influenced by if I happen to spawn in a red base or a blue base in that game.  Games like CS:GO and Call of Duty or Battlefield can alleviate these issues: CS deals with it by simply having two different team roles that depend on two different bases and halves; Call of Duty and Battlefield solve the issue by having dynamic spawnpoints based on where the enemy team is roughly located.  Neither of these are really an option for us. They might be in TPNext, but of course, we're not talking about that.  But that's asymmetry. While it's fun to think about, it simply wouldn't be feasible (in PUBs).  Which brings me back to the first paragraph: I think, by utilising our group-exclusive map option more, we can grant mapmakers a bit more freedom into which type of map they want to construct, without the necessity for baby-proofing, all the more making PUB maps and competitive rotations more interesting.  But I'm just one person."
TagPro,3cs8nk,adhi-,7,Fri Jul 10 12:05:39 2015 UTC,"It's fine to have asymmetrical maps for league play imo, because you switch sides for each half. Competitive Call of Duty Capture the Flag, for instance, is played on asymmetric maps, and the spawns in this game mode are roughly fixed, not dynamic. There's a ""good side"" and a ""bad side"" usually, but since each team gets an equal time playing each side, it doesn't really matter. It's still a fair contest."
TagPro,3cs8nk,3z_,3,Fri Jul 10 13:53:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with you there. But I'd rather see complicated symmetrical maps, than simplified asymmetrical ones."
TagPro,3cs8nk,DaEvil1,2,Fri Jul 10 15:51:12 2015 UTC,but we already have that asymmetry - it's called servers. you can't have two elements of asymmetry and only two halves per game.
TagPro,3cs8nk,mrcowmr,4,Fri Jul 10 18:18:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the solid response! Maybe the asymmetrical approach isn't best suited for PUBs but I think it'd for sure be great, and likely better suited, for competitive but I still think there could be a place for it in PUBs. As you've mentioned there maybe should be a separate process for approval between the two aspects of the game (LTP and pubs). And as I stated before in the OP and how it stands now, no xLTP map has been played before without being 'proven' in PUB rotation and it'd likely be very tough to get a non-pub map into a league rotation just because that is how it has always been and there is no real system in place to defy the current way of doing things.  I think there could be some really well thought out asymmetrical maps made exclusively for competitive, but they'd be hard to get into the circuit without widespread approval which, again, up to this point, 100% of xLTP maps have come from PUB rotation.   Even though other eSport games have more complex ways of dealing with asymmetrical maps via spawn points and other game mechanics, maybe if we eased an asymmetrical map or two into PUB rotation it would allow for more game wide integration of the entire concept?   In your example of the 45 base vs. Boombox base it still relies on one team having an offensively superior player which is just as random as any other game where it is you and three other random players of unknown skill versus four other players of unknown skill. Maybe if there were a true matchmaking system involved in PUBs it'd be different but as it stands the team you get in any particular game is pure luck of the draw when put up against the other four random balls.  Also, throughout your standard pub match the wall tiles, spikes, buttons, and gates are essentially the only stagnant aspects of a map -- and in some way, the power-ups, boosts, bombs, player spawns and the ways gates are used are constantly dynamic so, yes, a more skilled team can keep track of and time/take advantage of all of these game elements (aside from predicting spawns) so that leads back toward the map symmetry not being a necessity.   Of course, I will wait on some truly solid asymmetrical maps to be  made before I have my final opinion. I hope some are made eventually!"
TagPro,3cs8nk,DaEvil1,3,Fri Jul 10 13:04:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the solid response!   Of course! I normally wouldn't have written as much, but I got a new mechanical keyboard and it's so much fun to type on.   no xLTP map has been played before without being 'proven' in PUB rotation and it'd likely be very tough to get a non-pub map into a league rotation   Can confirm. The OLTP commissioners wanted to do this with an earlier version of Platypus (hence its addition to groups), but was vetoed by the community because it was too untested.   maybe if we eased an asymmetrical map or two into PUB rotation it would allow for more game wide integration of the entire concept?   Again, we could do this, but I think this sort of complexity might be best saved for TPN.   In your example of the 45 base vs. Boombox base it still relies on one team having an offensively superior player    Not necessarily. A better example would be Crabble by Flail, which made it to 4v4 testing a while back. This map is a good example because, although it may be balanced, defense on each side requires two different tactics: the left-hand side requires sniping (which some might be good at), while the right-hand side is more focussed around button-fights and gate-control.  However, if you have an asymmetrical map which requires the same strategies... Well, doesn't that defeat the point of it being asymmetrical?  But yeah matchmaking AFAIK will be in TPN (of course depending on player sizes), which again, may make this more feasible.   I will wait on some truly solid asymmetrical maps to be made before I have my final opinion.   Perhaps I shouldn't be dissuading people so much! I'm sure it's very possible for make a ""good"" asymmetrical map, I'm just a bit skeptical."
TagPro,3cs8nk,FaithNHumanityStatus,2,Fri Jul 10 13:26:26 2015 UTC,"Which brings me back to the first paragraph: I think, by utilising our group-exclusive map option more, we can grant mapmakers a bit more freedom into which type of map they want to construct, without the necessity for baby-proofing, all the more making PUB maps and competitive rotations more interesting.   I'd agree with this if it was feasible, but at the moment I don't see any big competition (maybe aside from OLTP) being open to playing official matches on a map that hasnt been in rotation at some point. People want to play what they're familiar with and they get familiar with new things in PUBs. People hardly ever PUG for fun anymore."
TagPro,3cs8nk,jwm5514,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:39:36 2015 UTC,Did you mean to say PUB?
TagPro,3cs8nk,FaithNHumanityStatus,3,Fri Jul 10 17:00:38 2015 UTC,"No, I meant PUG. The only PUGs that happens are usually ranked PUGs or SOCL or something. It's pretty rare to see just a random PUG going on without any tournament, league or ranking structure."
TagPro,3cs8nk,dinkin_flicka9,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:37:06 2015 UTC,Do you see maps where the bases are symmetrical but the surrounding elements/pieces are not?  I think as long as the bases are symmetrical you can alleviate a lot of this.
TagPro,3cs8nk,yeah_tagpro,2,Fri Jul 10 18:15:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not against your argument, but although we switch sides to balance the advantages of the map this would be far from equal when the teams are from different servers."

TagPro,3cs8nk,xenonpulse,2,Fri Jul 10 18:17:45 2015 UTC,Wombo Combo is terrible. I don't like having 10 minute neutral flag games
TagPro,3cs8nk,Risktp,-1,Sat Jul 11 00:06:37 2015 UTC,better than 12 minute boring CTF. at least neutral is fun
TagPro,3cs8nk,M4rtinEd3n,3,Sat Jul 11 04:59:53 2015 UTC,"Hmm i have a similiar feeling, i really love most of the Neutral flag maps but a lot of the CTF maps are just not that fun i feel. They are all not bad in any way and i really think the MTC stepped up their game and i dont see a bad map coming in any more. But i feel like a lot of the maps are just a little bit dull there is nothing you can be really excited about. I like battery because its full of things to do on the map, but on newer maps there is just nothing to do and even boosts are often at walls so you cant really boost freely. Hmm that is at least what i say to myself is the problem, i dont know if anybody has the same experience.  Also to the assymetrical part: i think if a map could pull that off that would be great, but i dont think that will happen it is to hard to pull off and there will always be people that say its not fair.  Edit.: TL;DR: Welp, Marz64 comment is what i think."
TagPro,3cs8nk,BuckeyeLeaves,2,Fri Jul 10 13:23:22 2015 UTC,"I think that the CTF maps are, in my opinion, fun individually.  But there are just so many of them that give me the exact same reaction.  Like whenever I spawn into Transilio, or Hub, or Ultradrive, I don't think ""oh, it's a defensive/ chasey/deadly/chaotic map"" like I used to about Star/Holy See/DZ3/Bombing Run.  They're all just... maps.  Fun maps, for the most part, but they're all structured very similarly and play in more or less the same way every game."
TagPro,3cs8nk,bashar_al_assad,3,Fri Jul 10 20:10:12 2015 UTC,"I feel like much the pub map rotation IS stale, not so much because the old maps have been in so long, but because the new maps are so cookie-cutter. First you have the ballsack maps, and now the trend is rotationally symmetrical with tiny patches of team tiles. I think Flame was the epitome of this, but since its retirement, I believe the MTC is making strides to introduce maps with more complex and original map elements, such as Draft and Ultradrive.  As far as league play goes, I'd like to see some EMERALD. As one of the few maps with a largely defensive bomb, I feel this map would greatly compliment the other new-ish maps in MLTP rotation. Though the bases are not terribly close, I like how quickly one can boost from one to the other, creating an extremely fast-paced and dynamic game."
TagPro,3cs8nk,BuckeyeLeaves,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:04:06 2015 UTC,"I know I've championed EMERALD to be a good competitive map in the past, but I've changed my opinion on it after recently playing it in USCM. The bases are way too defensive imo, it's really hard to grab and get out if the defense is reset because of the gates. It was very fast-paced, perhaps a bit too much for its small size, it just ended up being super chaotic."
TagPro,3cs8nk,bashar_al_assad,3,Fri Jul 10 20:45:27 2015 UTC,"Glad someone noticed that. Current map rotation is worst I've seen so far.   Most of the new CTF maps, except for the classic ones, are completely uninspiring. It produces a feeling that there are too many NF maps, even for me. And I absolutely love NF maps."
TagPro,3cs8nk,Risktp,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:40:45 2015 UTC,"So the one thing I will say, is that I'm starting to shift my belief that neutral flag maps should never be in MLTP rotation to the belief that they should. After playing Ricochet in a fairly competitive tournament, I realized I was actually having a lot of fun coming up with strats with teammates, and even ones that were well known were either executed or countered. I think it could bring an interesting twist and a nice addition to mix things up a bit in MLTP rotation. I still firmly believe, however, that Smirk, Boombox, and Velocity should all continue to make MLTP rotation at the very least."

TagPro,3cs8nk,BuckeyeLeaves,3,Fri Jul 10 20:02:31 2015 UTC,I think if we see Command Center in competitive play then by the end of the game the middle of the map will be a passable imitation of a World War I battlefield.
TagPro,3cs8nk,Swift_Shift,2,Fri Jul 10 20:10:39 2015 UTC,"God, please no Command Center. I've played it a couple times in USC and NF tournaments, it's one of the worst NF maps for competitive play.
